Commissioner. The Commissioner by the impugned order has

allowed the appeal preferred by respondent No.6. In the

meanwhile, respondent No.6 has also filed an application before

the SDO on the ground that at the time of submitting the

matter and on the basis of enquiry report, respondent No.6 has
