<div class="doc_title">Rampal Patel vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 5 August, 2014</div><pre id="pre_1">              Writ Petition No.11279/2014
05/08/2014
     Shri Raj Kumar Tripathi, learned counsel for the
petitioner.
     It is the contention of the petitioner that since he
was promoted on regular basis on the post of Peon vide
order dated 21.1.2003, he would be entitled to get his
placement in the gradation list of Peon and would also
be entitled to other consequential benefits. According to
the petitioner, one Rajendra Kumar Tiwari approached
this Court by way of filing W.P. No.17462/2007 (s), who
too was similarly situated, and in his case this Court has
directed the respondents vide order dated 10.11.2010</pre>
<p id="p_1">to grant certain benefits. It is contended that the
petitioner would also be entitled to the same benefits.
</p><p id="p_2">     On perusal of the order 10.11.2010, it is found that
after recording certain findings in the case of Rajendra
Kumar Tiwari (supra) this Court has allowed the writ
petition in the following manner:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">      "Accordingly, this petition is allowed. Order
      Annexure P/6 dated 23.11.2007 is quashed
      and the District Education Officer, Rewa is
      directed to decide the claim of the petitioner
      for including his name in the gradation list of
      Peon by a speaking order after taking note of
      various documents collectively filed by the
      petitioner as Annexure P/4 and P/5. On the
      petitioner's filing certified copy of this order
      along with relevant documents as indicated
      herein above, the District Education Officer is
      directed to decide the claim of the petitioner
      by a speaking order within a period of three
                 months and communicate the decision to the
                petitioner."
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">               It is further pointed out by the learned counsel for
          the petitioner that the order passed by this Court in the
          case of Rajendra Kumar Tiwari (supra) has been
          complied with and the said person has been granted the
          benefits vide order dated 28.12.2011.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">               That being so, without entering into the merits of
          the claim made in the writ petition, the same is disposed
          of with a direction to the respondents to examine the
          case of the petitioner in the light of the decision
          rendered by this Court in the case of Rajendra Kumar
          Tiwari (supra) within a period of two months from the
          date of receipt of the certified copy of the order passed
          today and in case it is found that the petitioner is
          identically situated, to extend the benefits as have been
          granted to said Rajendra Kumar Tiwari.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">               The writ petition stands disposed of.
               Certified copy as per rules.</blockquote>
