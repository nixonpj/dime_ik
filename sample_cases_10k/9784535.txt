 17                      W.P. 27780(W) of 2017


                      Uma Acharya
                          Vs.
                State of West Bengal &amp; ors.


      Mr. Kamalesh Bhattacharya
      Mr. Soujanya Bandyopadhyay
                                    ... For the petitioner

      Mr. Supriyo Chattopadhyay
      Ms. Iti Dutta                 ... For the State

      Mr. Sanjib Mitra     ... For the School authorities


     The grievance of the writ petitioner herein is that the disciplinary

proceeding initiated against the writ petitioner was without jurisdiction as the

person who issued the charge-sheet did not have the authority to do so as he

was not a member of the Managing Committee of the concerned school.

     Counsel on behalf of the writ petitioner submits that this person has

already left the school and the Managing Committee is defunct.

     Counsel on behalf of the writ petitioner further submits that suspension

order that has been passed against the writ petitioner by the Managing

Committee has already been set aside by the West Bengal Board of Secondary

Education.

     In light of the above and with the consent of the parties herein, I direct the

respondent no.4, being the President, West Bengal Board of Secondary</pre>

<p id="p_1">Education, to examine the charge-sheet that has been filed against the writ
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                           2</span>


petitioner and to determine whether the same has been issued by the

appropriate authority having jurisdiction to issue the same. The respondent no.4

is further directed to grant an opportunity of hearing to the writ petitioner and to

pass a reasoned order within four weeks from the date of communication of this

order. The reasoned order is to be communicated to the writ petitioner within two

weeks from the date of passing of such reasoned order.

</p><p id="p_2">      With the above observations, this writ petition is disposed of without,

however, any order as to costs.
</p>
<p id="p_3">      Since no affidavit is called for, the allegations made in the writ petition are

deemed not to have been admitted.
</p>
<p id="p_4">      All parties are to act on the website copy of this order.

</p><p id="p_5">                                      (Shekhar B. Saraf, J.)
