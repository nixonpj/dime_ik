                 ADDITIONAL SENIOR CIVIL JUDGE (SOUTH),
                        SAKET COURTS,  NEW DELHI


CS No. 222/11


M/s S.K. Auto Deals
                                                                     ......... Plaintiff.

                              Versus


Sh. Tirath Singh
                                                                      ......... Defendant.


ORDER: ­

1.              Vide this order I shall dispose of an application U/o 7 Rule 11 

   moved by the defendant.

2.              It is stated in the application that plaintiff has stated in the plaint 

   that it is body corporate engaged in the business providing finance as per 

   guidelines issued by the Govt. of India and as such it is admitted by the 

   plaintiff   that   it   is   money   lender   and   providing   finance   on   interest   and, 

   therefore, it ought to have been registered under the Punjab Registration of 

   Money Lenders' Act, 1938 which has been extended to Delhi. Admittedly, 

   the   plaintiff   is   unregistered   money   lender   and,   therefore,   present   suit   is 


CS No. 222/11                                                                         Page 1 of 5
    barred by Section 3 of the Punjab Registration of Money Lenders' Act, 1938 

   and is liable to be dismissed. It is further contended by the defendant that 

   plaintiff is allegedly a proprietorship firm and there is a mystery as to who is 

   the   proprietor   of   the   plaintiff   firm   and,   therefore,   the   suit   is   also   not 

   maintainable  as   per  the  provisions  of   Order 30  CPC  and  is  liable  to be 

   rejected on this ground also. It is further contended that the plaintiff has 

   alleged to have paid Rs. 2 lac to the defendant in cash, while such a cash 

   transaction is barred by law and, therefore, plaint is liable to be rejected. 

   Therefore, the defendant has prayed for rejection of the plaint.

3.              The   plaintiff   has   contested   the   application   by   filing   reply 

   contending that the defendant is merely trying to delay the proceedings and 

   is creating confusion by way of present application. The plaintiff has prayed 

   for dismissal of the application. 

4.              I   have   heard   the   Ld.   Counsel   for   the   parties   and   perused   the 

   record carefully. 

5.              From the averments made in the plaint, it is apparent that plaintiff 

   is   a   body   corporate   engaged   in   the   business   of   providing   finances.   The 

   plaintiff has claimed that the defendant approached the plaintiff for availing 

   personal loan to the tune of Rs. 2,00,000/­ on 15.08.2008 which was granted 

   by the plaintiff.   PW­1 Ms. Rashmi who is the proprietor of the plaintiff 


CS No. 222/11                                                                            Page 2 of 5
    firm has also admitted in her cross­examination that they do the finance 

   business. She has also admitted that she has not obtained any license or 

   permission in Punjab Money Lending Act or any other Act. 

6.               On   the   aforesaid   assertions   and   admission   of   the   plaintiff,   the 

   defendant has contended in the present application that since the plaintiff is 

   engaged in business of providing finance, it ought to have been registered 

   under the Punjab Registration of Money Lenders' Act, 1938 and  admittedly, 

   the plaintiff is unregistered money lender, therefore, present suit is barred by 

   Section 3 of the Punjab Registration of Money Lenders' Act, 1938. 

7.               Before proceeding further, it would be relevant here to discuss the 

   relevant provisions of law. Section 3 of The Punjab Registration of Money 

   Lenders' Act, 1938 reads as under:­

   " Notwithstanding anything contained in any other enactment for the time being  
   in force, a suit by a money­lender for the recovery of a loan; or an application by  
   a money­lender for the execution of a decree relating to a loan, shall, after the  
   commencement of this Act, be dismissed, unless the money­lender
   (a) at the  time  of the  institution  of the suit or  presentation  of the application  
   for execution; or
   (b) at the time of decreeing the suit or deciding the application for execution­
   (i) is registered; and 
   (ii) holds a valid license, in such form and manner as may be prescribed; or
   (iii) holds a certificate from the Chief Commissioner granted under section 11,  
   specifying   the   loan   in   respect  of  which   the   suit   is   instituted,   or   the   decree   in  
   respect of which the application for execution is presented; or
   (iv)_______

CS No. 222/11                                                                                     Page 3 of 5
 8.              From   the   aforesaid   provisions   of   Section   3   of   The   Punjab 

   Registration of Money Lenders' Act, 1938, it is apparent that a suit filed by 

   the money­lender for recovery of loan would not be maintainable unless the 

   money lender is registered and holds a valid license. However, money­lender 

   is required to be registered either at the time of the institution of the suit or 

   at the time of decreeing the suit. As per Section 3 (b) of the aforesaid Act, 

   the plaintiff has an option to get registered and obtain a license for money 

   lending business till the time of decreeing the suit. Therefore, it cannot be 

   said that if the plaintiff is doing the finance business or dealing in money 

   lending business and is not registered and does not hold a valid license for 

   money lending business at the time of institution of the suit, the suit is liable 

   to   be   dismissed   as   per   section   3   of   The   Punjab   Registration   of   Money 

   Lenders' Act, 1938.  By virtue of Section 3 (b) of the Act, the plaintiff still 

   has   an   option   to   get   it   registered   and   to   obtain   a   license   till   the   suit   is 

   decreed. Therefore, at this stage, the application moved by the defendant is 

   pre­mature and the contention of the defendant that since the plaintiff is 

   dealing in finance business and it is not registered under the aforesaid Act, 

   the suit is barred under the provisions of the said Act is of no avail at this 

   stage.  Of course, if at the time of decreeing the suit, the plaintiff is not 

   registered under the aforesaid Act and does not hold any valid license, this 

CS No. 222/11                                                                                   Page 4 of 5
    contention of the defendant shall be considered. 

9.              So far the other contentions of the defendant that the plaintiff has 

   not been able to prove that who is the proprietor of the plaintiff firm and, 

   therefore, the suit is not maintainable as per the provisions of Order 30 CPC 

   and further that plaintiff has alleged to have paid Rs. 2 lac to the defendant 

   in cash which is barred by law are concerned, these contentions are matter 

   of   trial   and   are   to   be   adjudicated   upon   and   on   these   contentions,   plaint 

   cannot be rejected.  Similarly the contention of the defendant that defendant 

   had already paid Rs. 2 lacs to the plaintiff, which is denied by the plaintiff in 

   the reply and therefore, same is again a matter of trial as to whether nothing 

   is due and outstanding against the defendant. 

10.             In   the   light   of   aforesaid   discussions,   there   is   no   merit   in   the 

   application moved by the defendant U/o 7 Rule 11 CPC and same is hereby 

   dismissed.
