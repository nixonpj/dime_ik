</p><p id="p_15">8. After prosecution evidence, statement of accused under <a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_1">section 313</a>

Cr.P.C was recorded. All the incriminating evidence was put to the

accused. Accused denied all the allegations stating that she has been

falsely implicated in this case. However, accused did not choose to lead

any evidence in her defence.
</p>
<p id="p_16">
</p><p id="p_17">FIR No.185/05                State Vs. Radha Devi            (Page 5 of 11)
</p><p id="p_18"> 9. Arguments advanced by Ld. APP for the State and Ld. Defence counsel

were heard. Record perused. Ld. defence counsel has argued that the

case of prosecution is entirely based upon the testimony of police

witnesses and is not independently corroborated. On the other hand, Ld.

APP has submitted that the prosecution has been able to prove its case.



</p><p id="p_19">10. It is cardinal principle of criminal jurisprudence that an accused is

presumed to be innocent and therefore, the burden lies on the prosecution

to prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt.               The

prosecution is under a legal obligation to prove each and every ingredient

of the offence beyond any doubt unless otherwise so provided by any

statute. This general burden never shifts and it always rests on the

prosecution.
</p>
<p id="p_20">

</p><p id="p_21">11.   After going through the complete evidence and records of this case,

I am of the view that accused namely Radha Devi deserves acquittal in this

case on the following grounds:-
</p>
<p id="p_22">
   (I) Firstly, if the police personnel who has apprehended the accused
      with the illicit liquor was on patrolling duty, prosecution should have
      brought the relevant records showing their arrival and departure and
      should have proved by documentary evidence that he was on


FIR No.185/05                State Vs. Radha Devi             (Page 6 of 11)
       patrolling duty by producing DD entry for the same.
</p><p id="p_23">                As per the chapter 22 Rule 49 of the Punjab Police Rules,
      which is reproduced as under:
</p><p id="p_24">      "Chapter 22 Rule 49 Matter to be entered in Register no.11. The
      following matters shall amongst others, be entered :
</p><p id="p_25">      (c) The hour of arrival and departure on duty at or from a police
      station of all enrolled police officers of whatever rank, whether
      posted at a police station or elsewhere with a statement of the
      nature of their duty. This entry shall be made immediately on arrival
      or prior to the departure of the officer concerned and shall be
      attested by the latter personally by signature or seal.
      Note: The term police station will include all places such as Police
      Lines and Police Posts where Register no.11 is maintained.


</p><p id="p_26">12.   In view of this rule, while deposing none of the prosecution

witnesses has told that by what entry in register no.11, they were patrolling

in the particular area. In the present case also, this provision has not been

complied with by prosecution witnesses. The relevant entries regarding the

arrival and departure of the police officials has not been proved on record.

It has been held in Rattan Lal Vs. State 1987 (2) Crimes 29 the Hon'ble

High Court held that :
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">      "wherein it has been observed that if the investigating agency
      deliberately ignores to comply with the provisions of the Act the
      Courts will have to approach their action with reservations.         The
      matter has to be viewed with suspicion if the provisions of l:aw are



FIR No.185/05                State Vs. Radha Devi               (Page 7 of 11)
       not strictly complied with and the least that can be said is that it is so
      done with an oblique motive. This failure to bring on record, the DD
      entries creates a reasonable doubt in the prosecution version and
      attributes oblique motive on the part of the prosecution".
</blockquote>

<p id="p_27">13. Secondly, the prosecution has examined four witnesses, however no

independent witness has been examined even though recovery witness

has deposed that the accused was apprehended near residential area and

IO had requested 4-5 passerby to join the investigation. It is not clear as to

why no legal action was taken against such persons who had refused to be

a witness. In the case of <a href="/doc/59733350/" id="a_2">Hemraj vs State of Haryana</a> (AIR 2005 SC

2110) it was observed that "the fact that no independent witness though

available, was examined and not even an explanation was sough:t to be

given for not examining such witness is a serious infirmity in the

prosecution case".
</p>
<p id="p_28">

</p><p id="p_29">14. In Roop Chand Vs. The State of Haryana 1999 (12) C.L.R, the Punjab

and Haryana High Court held as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">            "It is well settled principle of the law that investigating Agency
      should join independent witness at the time of recovery of
      contraband articles, if they were available and their failure to do so in
      such a situation casts a shadow of doubt on the prosecution case. In
      the present case also, admittedly the independent witnesses were



FIR No.185/05                 State Vs. Radha Devi              (Page 8 of 11)
       available at the time of recovery but they refused to associate
      themselves in the investigation. This explanation does not inspire
      confidence because the police officials who are the only witnesses
      examined in the case have not given the names and addresses of
      the persons contacted to join. It is a very common excuse that the
      witnesses from the public refused to join the investigation. A police
      officer conducting investigation of a crime is entitled to ask anybody
      to join the investigation and on refusal by a person from the public
      the police officer can take action against such a person under the
      law. Had it been a fact that the witnesses from the public had
      refused to join the investigation, the investigating officer must have
      proceeded against them under the relevant provision of law. The
      failure to do so by the police officer is suggestive of the fact that the
      explanation for non joining the witnesses from the public is an after
      thought and is not worthy of credence. All these facts taken together
      make the prosecution case highly doubtful".
</blockquote>

<p id="p_30">15.   Since all the witnesses are police personnels and the necessary

safeguards in the investigation have not been followed by the investigating

officer, I am of the view that charges of false implication cannot be ruled

out at the instance of the police.
</p>
<p id="p_31">

</p><p id="p_32">16.   Further as per the case of the prosecution, it is not clear to whom the

seal after use was handed over and when the seal was returned to the IO.

No memo has been prepared and proved on the record. The prosecution



FIR No.185/05                 State Vs. Radha Devi             (Page 9 of 11)
 was bound to prove on the record as to when the seal was returned to the

IO to remove the element of the tampering with the case property. There is

no evidence that the sample remained intact till delivery to the office of

chemical examiner.
</p>
<p id="p_33">

</p><p id="p_34">17. Furthermore, there are couple of inconsistencies in the prosecution

version. Case property when examined in the court, it was found cane was

empty, hence, recovery of illicit liquor as alleged by prosecution is doubtful.

No source of light has been shown in the site plan. It is not clear as to on

what suspicion the accused was apprehended. Further the departure and

arrival entries of the official witnesses have not been proved. The

testimony of the official witnesses in the present case is not strong enough

to base the conviction of the accused. In the criminal law, the prosecution

has to prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt, however,

in the present case prosecution has miserably failed to do so.



</p><p id="p_35">18. In view of above mentioned facts and circumstances, I hold that the

prosecution has failed to prove its case against the accused beyond

reasonable doubt. Accordingly, accused Ms. Radha Devi stands acquitted

of the offence u/s 61 of the Punjab Excise Act, 1914. However, she shall

furnish a fresh bail bond, which shall remain in force for a period of six


FIR No.185/05                 State Vs. Radha Devi             (Page 10 of 11)
 months from today U/s 437A Cr. P. C. Documents if any be returned after

cancellation of endorsement. The case property be confiscated and be

destroyed after expiry of period of appeal.
