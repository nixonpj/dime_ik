     THIS WRIT PETITION IS FILED UNDER ARTICLES 226 &amp;

TO THIS WP; ETC.


     THIS WRIT PETITION COMING ON FOR PRL.HEARING
THIS DAY, THE COURT MADE THE FOLLOWING:



                         ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">     Sri.Ariga,    learned   Government.    Advocate     is

directed to take notice for Respondent No.3.


</p><p id="p_2">     2.    The order impugned directing prosecution of

the petitioner exercising jurisdiction under Sec.34 of the

Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 is tainted by illegality

since, admittedly, the Commissioner who passed the

order did not hear the parties while it was the then

Additional. Commissioner of Labour who heard the

parties after notice.   On that score alone this petition

deserves to be allowed and the order Annexure-H

quashed.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                               3</span><p id="p_3">

</p><p id="p_4">                                                   W.P.24741/12

</p><p id="p_5">     3.    Learned Government. Advocate submits that

the then Commissioner of Labour is before Court and

submits, on instructions, that it is the usual practice in

the Labour Department for one Officer to hear the

parties and another officer to pass the orders when once

the officer is transferred.       This practice is pernicious

and deserves to be put an end to. As noticed supra if

the Additional Labour Commissioner heard the parties

then it was for that officer to have passed the orders

and the Commissioner could not have usurped the

jurisdiction which the Additional Commissioner, had,

having initiated the proceedings. It is not known when

the then Additional. Commissioner Sri.Gurudas Bhat

retired and even if he had retired the Commissioner had

no business to take over his file and pass orders

without notice to the parties.
</p>
<p id="p_6">

</p><p id="p_7">     4.    The obnoxious practice of quasi-judicial

authorities exercising quasi-judicial functions in a
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                  4</span>

                                                     W.P.24741/12

cavalier fashion having come to light requires the Prl.

Secretary, Labour to look into the matter, hold an

enquiry and if necessary put the officers through an

educational regime so as to understand what quasi-

judicial authority is and any other form of learning so as

not to commit glaring mistakes in the matter of passing

of orders while exercising quasi-judicial authority.



</p><p id="p_8">        Let   a   copy   of   this   order   be   forwarded   to

Prl.Secretary, Labour, Government of Karnataka for

necessary action and a report to the Registrar General

of this court by 29th March, 2014.
