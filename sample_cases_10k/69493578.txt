           entertained. The petitioner is mainly claiming the relief of direction to

           official respondents to register FIR against the culprits. The petitioner

           has the remedy to approach learned Judicial Magistrate under <a href="/doc/99487/" id="a_10">Section

           156(3)</a> Cr.P.C. for the above-said relief.               The petitioner has also

<blockquote id="blockquote_1">                                "11. In this connection we would like to state that if a
                                person has a grievance that the police station is not
                                registering his FIR under <a href="/doc/1980578/" id="a_13">Section 154</a> Cr.P.C., then he can
                                approach the Superintendent of Police under <a href="/doc/1980578/" id="a_14">Section 154</a>
                                (3) <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_15">Cr.P.C</a>. by an application in writing. Even if that does
                                not yield any satisfactory result in the sense that either the
                                FIR is still not registered, or that even after registering it
                                no proper investigation is held, it is open to the aggrieved
                                person to file an application under <a href="/doc/1291024/" id="a_16">Section 156</a> (3) <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_17">Cr.P.C</a>.
                                before the learned Magistrate concerned. If such an
                                application under <a href="/doc/1291024/" id="a_18">Section 156</a> (3) is filed before the
                                Magistrate, the Magistrate can direct the FIR to be
                                registered and also can direct a proper investigation to be
                                made, in a case where, according to the aggrieved
                                person, no proper investigation was made. The Magistrate
                                can also under the same provision monitor the
                                investigation to ensure a proper investigation.

<blockquote id="blockquote_2">                                17. In our opinion <a href="/doc/99487/" id="a_19">Section 156(3)</a> Cr.P.C. is wide enough
                                to include all such powers in a Magistrate which are
                                necessary for ensuring a proper investigation, and it
                                includes the power to order registration of an F.I.R. and of
                                ordering a proper investigation if the Magistrate is satisfied
                                that a proper investigation has not been done, or is not
                                being done by the police. <a href="/doc/99487/" id="a_20">Section 156(3)</a> Cr.P.C., though
                                briefly worded, in our opinion, is very wide and it will
                                include all such incidental powers as are necessary for
                                ensuring a proper investigation.</blockquote>

<p id="p_6">                                18. It is well-settled that when a power is given to an
                                authority to do something it includes such incidental or
                                implied powers which would ensure the proper doing of
                                that thing. In other words, when any power is expressly
                                granted by the statute, there is impliedly included in the

                                grant, even without special mention, every power and

                                itself ineffective. Thus where an Act confers jurisdiction it
                                impliedly also grants the power of doing all such acts or

                                execution.
</p>
<p id="p_7">                                25. We have elaborated on the above matter because we
                                often find that when someone has a grievance that his FIR
                                has not been registered at the police station and/or a
                                proper investigation is not being done by the police, he
                                rushes to the High Court to file a writ petition or a petition
                                under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_21">Section 482</a> Cr.P.C. We are of the opinion that the
                                High Court should not encourage this practice and should
                                ordinarily refuse to interfere in such matters, and relegate
                                the petitioner to his alternating remedy, firstly under
                                <a href="/doc/1622626/" id="a_22">Section 154(3)</a> and <a href="/doc/1013783/" id="a_23">Section 36</a> Cr.P.C. before the
                                concerned police officers, and if that is of no avail, by
                                approaching the concerned Magistrate under <a href="/doc/1291024/" id="a_24">Section 156</a>
                                (3).
</p>
<p id="p_8">                                26. If a person has a grievance that his FIR has not been
                                registered by the police station his first remedy is to
                                approach the Superintendent of Police under <a href="/doc/1980578/" id="a_25">Section 154</a>
                                (3) <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_26">Cr.P.C</a>. or other police officer referred to in <a href="/doc/1013783/" id="a_27">Section 36</a>
                                Cr.P.C. If despite approaching the Superintendent of
                                Police or the officer referred to in <a href="/doc/1013783/" id="a_28">Section 36</a> his grievance
                                still persists, then he can approach a Magistrate under
                                <a href="/doc/99487/" id="a_29">Section 156(3)</a> Cr.P.C. instead of rushing to the High Court
                                by way of a writ petition or a petition under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_30">Section 482</a>
                                Cr.P.C. Moreover he has a further remedy of filing a
                                criminal complaint under <a href="/doc/444619/" id="a_31">Section 200</a> Cr.P.C. Why then
                                should writ petitions or <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_32">Section 482</a> petitions be
                                entertained when there are so many alternative remedies?

<p id="p_9">                                27. As we have already observed above, the Magistrate
                                has very wide powers to direct registration of an FIR and
                                to ensure a proper investigation, and for this purpose he
                                can monitor the investigation to ensure that the
                                investigation is done properly (though he cannot
                                investigate himself). The High Court should discourage the
                                practice of filing a writ petition or petition under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_33">Section
                                482</a> Cr.P.C. simply because a person has a grievance that
                                his FIR has not been registered by the police, or after
                                being registered, proper investigation has not been done
                                by the police. For this grievance, the remedy lies under
                                <a href="/doc/1013783/" id="a_34">Sections 36</a> and <a href="/doc/1622626/" id="a_35">154(3)</a> before the concerned police
                                officers, and if that is of no avail, under <a href="/doc/99487/" id="a_36">Section 156(3)</a>
                                Cr.P.C. before the Magistrate or by filing a criminal
                                complaint under <a href="/doc/444619/" id="a_37">Section 200</a> Cr.P.C. and not by filing a

<p id="p_10">                                28. It is true that alternative remedy is not an absolute bar
                                to a writ petition, but it is equally well settled that if there is
                                an alternative remedy the High Court should not ordinarily
                                interfere."

<p id="p_11">                                The law laid down in above judgment has also been relied

           above-said case, especially to approach the Judicial Magistrate,

           therefore, this petition cannot be entertained and the same is

           disposed of with liberty to the petitioner to approach the Magistrate to

           avail alternative remedies.
