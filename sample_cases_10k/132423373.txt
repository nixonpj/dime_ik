                 CORAM: HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE CHAKRADHARI
                 SHARAN SINGH
                 ORAL ORDER</pre>

<p id="p_1">6   18-04-2016             Heard learned counsel for the parties.

</p><p id="p_2">                          The present application has been filed seeking quashing of

                 the First Information Report of Muffasil P.S. Case No. 230 of

                 2013,     disclosing         offences        punishable         under        Sections

                 406,420,467,468,470,471 read with <a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_1">Section 34</a> of the Indian Penal

                 Code.
</p>
<p id="p_3">                          Briefly narrated, the case of the prosecution is that an

                 agreement was executed on 25.05.2012 between the Opposite

                 party No.2 ( Informant) and the petitioner for sale of Plot No.

                 1023, Khata No.60 against which a sum of Rs. 50,000,00/- was

                 paid by Opposite party to the petitioner. After the said agreement

                 having been entered into, the Opposite party learnt that the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                        2</span>




petitioner had already sold the land to someone. On the allegation

that the petitioner mis-represented the facts      and induced the

petitioner to pay the said amount of Rs. 50,000,00/- which he

misappropriated, the present First Information Report came to be

registered.
</p>
<p id="p_4">        It appears that for the purpose of grant of regular bail, the

petitioner agreed before the Court below that he would be paying

the informant to a sum of Rs. 70,000,00/-. He has not paid the

said amount and accordingly his bail bond has been cancelled, as

submitted by the learned counsel appearing on behalf of Opposite

party No.2, which fact has not been disputed by the learned

counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner.

</p><p id="p_5">        It cannot be said that on the basis of the allegation as

contained in the First Information Report, no cognizable offence is

made out.
</p>
<p id="p_6">        Learned counsel for the petitioner has attempted to

persuade that the dispute between the petitioner and Opposite

party No.2 is purely civil in nature and remedy of the informant

lies before the Civil Court of competent jurisdiction. According to

him, the present criminal prosecution is abuse of the process of the

Court to extract money from the petitioner.

</p><p id="p_7">         Be that as it may, the fact remains that the allegations
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                      3</span>




              contained in the First Information Report constitute cognizable

              offence. The bail granted to the petitioner in connection with

              Muffasil P.S. Case No. 230 of 2013 has admittedly been

              cancelled. The petitioner has thus, not honoured the condition of

              bail and is absconding from the course of justice.         In such

              circumstance, I am not inclined to exercise inherent jurisdiction of

              this Court available under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_2">Section 482</a> of the Code of Criminal

              Procedure, 1973.
</p>
<p id="p_8">                      This application is, accordingly, dismissed.
