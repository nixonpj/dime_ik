                         JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">Ramachandra Menon, J.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">1.Interference declined by the learned Single

 Judge  with    regard          to      the       challenge     raised

 against Exts.P4 and P5 orders passed by the 3rd

 respondent fixing huge liability of tax upon

 the    shoulders             of          the           appellant/writ

 petitioner/assessee in terms of the Kerala Tax

 on Luxuries Act, 1976 ("KTL Act" for short) is

 under challenge in this appeal.



</p><p id="p_4">2.Heard  Sri.Joseph           Kodianthara,                 the learned

 Senior counsel for the appellant as well as the

 learned Special Government Pleader for Taxes,

 at length.
</p>
<p id="p_5">

</p><p id="p_6">3.The  facts   and       sequence            of      events    in  the

 proceedings are that, the appellant/Company is

 running a hotel in the name and style as "The

W.A.377/17
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                       2</span>

  Windsor Castle" at Kodimatha, Kottayam. It also

  runs     an Educational  Institution   imparting

  learning to the students in the relevant field.

  The said institution is being run based on the

  fees collected and received; in turn providing

  them learning with food, accommodation and such

  other infrastructure. As a natural consequence,

  income is also derived by running of the said

  Educational Institution. On completion of the

  course,    students  are  being   awarded  with

  Diplomas. A specimen certificate is produced as

  Ext.P1.
</p>
<p id="p_7">

</p><p id="p_8">4.It is the case of the appellant that they were

  satisfying all the dues to the Government under

  the relevant provisions of the law. On a fine

  morning, the 3rd respondent issued Ext.P2 notice

  to the appellant stating that in respect of the

  year 2010-2011, (the assessment of which was

  completed on 18.3.2015), the amount received to

  the tune of Rs.58,21,550/- under the head other

  income-training institute Windsor School for

  the year 2010-11 was omitted to reckon for

W.A.377/17
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                       3</span>

  fixation of tax in terms of Section 4(1) of the

  KTL Act. Any amount collected towards food and

  accommodation would come within the purview of

  the taxable income and hence, the assessment

  was sought to be re-opened as escaped turn over

  in terms of Section 6(5) as to the assessee to

  submit the objection, if any.
</p>
<p id="p_9">

</p><p id="p_10">5.On receipt of Ext.P2, detailed objection was

  submitted as per Ext.P3 pointing out the facts

  and figures including the income derived from

  the Educational Institution was not liable to

  be taxed in terms of the KTL Act. However,

  without any regard to the specific objection

  raised and absolutely without any discussion,

  the proceedings were finalized by the third

  respondent as per Ext.P4 order fixing a balance

  tax liability of 11,14,710/- with interest.

  This was followed by Ext.P5 revised order,

  whereby the balance liability was brought down

  to Rs.7,27,694/- + interest. This made the

  appellant to feel aggrieved, which was sought

  to be challenged by filing the writ petition

W.A.377/17
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                         4</span>

  before this Court.
</p>
<p id="p_11">

</p><p id="p_12">6.When     the  matter  came up  for  consideration

  before     the  learned  Single  Judge,  it   was

  observed     that  the  basic  issue  had to  be

  resolved with reference to the actual facts and

  figures especially as to the quantum of income,

  if      any,  generated   from  the   Educational

  Institution;     which  exercise  could  not  be

  pursued in a writ proceeding. It was also noted

  that Ext.P4 order was passed in March, 2016. It

  was accordingly, that the writ petitioner was

  relegated     to  avail   the  statutory remedy,

  declining interference, which forms the subject

  matter of challenge in this appeal.



</p><p id="p_13">7.The learned Special Government Pleader points

  out that there is nothing wrong in exercising

  the discretion of the learned Single Judge as

  above.     The assessee  is  having  a  statutory

  remedy by way of appeal. The learned Senior

  counsel     for   the   appellant  submits  that

  absolutely no discussion is there in Ext.P4

W.A.377/17
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                         5</span>

  order as to why the explanation pointed out by

  the     appellant/assessee  in Ext.P3  is   not

  sustainable. Though the contents of the notice

  and the reply have been extracted, nothing has

  been stated by the Assessing Authority as to

  the taxability of the income derived from the

  Educational Institution, but for saying that as

  per Section 4 of the KTL Act, the amount

  received is taxable. The learned Senior counsel

  submits that the matter was entrusted with a

  learned    counsel   to   have the  proceedings

  challenged. But by virtue of unfortunate turn

  of events, the learned counsel had to fight

  with a deadly disease and he bid farewell to

  this world. It is also pointed out that the

  lapse, if any, on the part of the lawyer might

  not be a barrier in pursuing the rights of the

  litigant.
</p>
<p id="p_14">

</p><p id="p_15">8.After hearing both the sides and on going

  through Ext.P4 order passed by the Assessing

  Authority, this Court does not require any

  second thought to hold that Ext.P4 order passed

W.A.377/17
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                         6</span>

  by the Assessing Authority is not at all a

  'speaking     order' for  not  having  made any

  discussion as to the scope of challenge with

  regard to the issue projected therein. Even if

  the matter is let to be pursued by way of

  statutory     appeal as  now  relegated  by the

  learned Single Judge, the issue may have to be

  remanded for fresh consideration for fixing the

  liability in respect of the actual quantum of

  tax,     if   any.  To   avoid  multiplicity of

  proceedings and also in view of the particular

  facts     and  circumstances  projected  by the

  appellant as to the circumstances under which

  the challenge could not be raised then and

  there, this Court finds that the matter could

  be caused to be re-considered afresh by the

  Assessing Authority, subject to terms.



</p><p id="p_16">9.Accordingly, Ext.P4 order passed by the 3rd

  respondent and Ext.P5 revised order (reducing

  the     actual extent  of  liability) stand set

  aside. The 3rd respondent - Assessing Authority

  is directed to pass a speaking order afresh,

W.A.377/17
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                            7</span>

  after affording an opportunity of hearing to

  the appellant, also enabling to produce all the

  relevant records. This however, is subject to

  the condition that the appellant, to prove the

  bona fides, shall satisfy 1/3rd of the balance

  tax as shown in Ext.P5, plus interest accrued

  thereon, within one month from the date of

  receipt     of a  copy       of  this judgment. The

  proceedings   shall      be   finalized by  the 3rd

  respondent, as expeditiously as possible, at

  any rate, within three months from the date of

  receipt of a copy of this judgment.

     The appeal stands allowed to the said extent.

  No cost.
