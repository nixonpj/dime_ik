PRADIP MOHANTY, J.           Appellant Garbapu Venkatiramana and two others
       (Garbapu Prasad and Garbapu Ramulu) were facing trial in the court of
       learned Additional Sessions Judge, Rayagada in Sessions Case No.51 of 1997
       (Original S.C. No. 158 of 1997 of the Sessions Judge, Koraput, Jeypore) being
       charged under Sections 302/324/34, <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_1">IPC</a>.            By the judgment and order dated
       11.06.1998, the learned trial Judge while acquitting Garbapu Prasad and Garbapu
       Ramulu of the charge, convicted the appellant under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_2">Sections 302</a>/<a href="/doc/724142/" id="a_3">324</a>, <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_4">IPC</a> and
       sentenced him to undergo imprisonment for life for the offence under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_5">Section 302</a>,
       <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_6">IPC</a>, but did not impose any separate sentence for the offence under <a href="/doc/724142/" id="a_7">section 324</a>,
       <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_8">IPC</a>.
</p><p id="p_2">       2.                    Case of the prosecution is that on 10.3.1997 at about 8.00
       P.M. Garabapu Elemma, the daughter of Garabapu Ramulu (co-accused since
       acquitted) was shaking the supporting wire of the electric pole situated in the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                          2</span>



locality. In course of shaking, there was sparking in the live wire of the electric
line. P.W.2, the informant (wife of P.W.1) told her not to do that as there were
chances of causing damage to the houses of the locality. But she continued to
repeat the same. At that time, P.W.1 came and protested, but she did not listen
and started rebuking P.W.1. When P.W.1 confronted Elemma as to why she was
rebuking, the three accused persons appeared and started abusing P.Ws.1 &amp; 2
instead of cautioning Elamma. Then the present appellant went to his house,
came with a knife and dealt a knife blow to the left arm of P.W.1. As a result,
P.W.1 sustained bleeding injury on his arm. At that juncture, Dharmani Krishna
(deceased), younger brother of P.W.1, arrived at the spot. When he challenged
the appellant, the appellant on being instigated by the co-accused persons (since
acquitted) stabbed to the left side chest of the deceased. As a result of such
stabbing, the deceased died at the spot sustaining bleeding injury. The informant
with the help of her husband's younger brothers shifted P.W.1 to the hospital and
lodged FIR in the Rayagada Police Station, consequent upon which, police
registered the case, investigated into the matter and submitted charge sheet
under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_9">sections 302</a>/<a href="/doc/724142/" id="a_10">324</a>/<a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_11">34</a>, <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_12">IPC</a> against the three accused persons including the
present appellant.
</p>
<p id="p_3">3.                   The accused persons took the plea of complete denial. Their
specific plea was that co-accused Garbapu Ramulu (since acquitted) was
admitted in the hospital as he had sustained injury on his left thigh on being
assaulted by P.W.1 and others. For that, a counter case was instituted against
P.W.1 and others. Their further plea was that one Adinarayan, the brother of
P.W.1 used the knife against co-accused Garbapu Ramulu. As the deceased was
standing very close behind his brother (P.W.1), while dealing knife blows against
co-accused Garbapu Ramulu, the injury was caused by Adinarayan on the left
arm of P.W.1. The knife slipped from the left arm and entered into the left side
chest of the deceased who sustained injury on the chest and died
instantaneously.
</p>
<p id="p_4">4.                   In order to prove its case, prosecution examined as many as
fifteen witnesses and exhibited seventeen documents. Defence examined two
witnesses.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                          3</span>



<p id="p_5">5.                   The trial court after conclusion of the trial acquitted the co-
accused persons (Garbapu Prasad and Garbapu Ramulu) of the charge, but
convicted and sentenced the appellant as stated hereinbefore.
</p>
<p id="p_6">6.                   Mr. Acharya, learned counsel for the appellant assails the
judgment on the following grounds:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">             (i)     Conviction having been based relying on the tainted
                     testimony of interested and partisan witnesses who have tried
                     to develop the case in Court, cannot be sustained.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">             (ii)    No explanation was given by the prosecution with regard to
                     the injury on the person of the co-accused Garbapu Ramulu
                     and thereby prosecution has suppressed the true state of
                     affairs.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">             (iii)   The investigation was biased, perfunctory and suffers from
                     serious infirmity, as the I.O. suppressing the defence story
                     has recorded the statements of the witnesses.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">             iv)     Leading to discovery has not been proved by the prosecution.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_7">7.                   Mr. Pattnaik, learned Additional Government Advocate, on
the other hand, supports the impugned judgment and vehemently contends that
the evidence of the eye witnesses is very clear, cogent and convincing. There is
no contradiction with regard to assault on the deceased. The injury sustained by
co-accused Garbapu Ramulu is superficial and the counter case has been falsely
initiated against the informant group. The evidence of P.W.2, the informant, and
other eye witnesses corroborates the F.I.R. The evidence of P.Ws.1, 4, 5, 10, 11
and 13 with regard to seizure of M.O.I is supported by the version of P.W.2.
Perfunctory investigation is not a ground to disbelieve the evidence of the eye
witnesses. Leading to discovery has been proved by independent witness P.W.4.

<p id="p_9">9.                   Perused the LCR and the decisions cited by the parties.
P.W.1 is an injured and a witness to the occurrence. P.W.2 is the informant and
wife of P.W.1 as well as sister-in-law of the deceased. She specifically stated that
Elemma, daughter of co-accused Garbapu Ramulu, was shaking the supporting
wire of the electric pole situated in her locality. In course of shaking, there was
sparking in the live wire of the electric line. She advised Elamma not to do that, as
there were chances of sparking and damages to the houses of the locality. But
she continued the same act. At that time, her husband P.W.1 came and protested,
but Elamma did not listen.      Rather she started rebuking P.W.1 to which he
protested. At that time, all the three accused persons appeared at the spot. They
did not say anything to Elamma but started abusing them. The appellant went to
his house, came with a knife in his hand to the spot and dealt knife blow to the left
arm of P.W.1 and thereby P.W.1 sustained bleeding injury on his arm. At that
juncture, the deceased, brother of P.W.1, arrived there and when he tried to shift
P.W.1 to the hospital, co-accused Ramulu and Prasad came to the spot and
instigated the appellant to stab the deceased. The appellant stabbed on the left
side chest of the deceased causing profuse bleeding. Then the deceased came
up to the electric pole and fell down there. When she tried to give some water to
the deceased, he could not take and died at the spot. P.W.1 was shifted to the
hospital and admitted there. He lost his sense while he was taken to hospital.
Thereafter, P.W.2 went to the police station and orally reported the mater. She
identified M.O.I as the weapon of offence. In cross-examination, she admitted that
a case was instituted against her husband P.W.1 and his two brothers by the
accused persons. She also admitted that she narrated the incident to the police in
Telgu language. She further admitted about the admission of Ramulu in the
hospital. Nothing has been elicited from her cross-examination to disbelieve her
testimony. P.W.1 is the injured and the husband of P.W.2. He corroborated the
statement of P.W.2. P.W.1 in cross-examination stated that he regained his sense
three days after the occurrence and he had lost his sense after seeing the death
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                           5</span>



of the deceased. P.W.3 is a witness to the seizure of the shirt of P.W.1, the
injured. P.W.4 is a witness to the inquest as well as seizure of blood stained
cemented plaster. He is also a witness to the leading to discovery of M.O.I. He
proved Exts.3, 4, 5 and 6. He also specifically stated that the appellant voluntarily
gave the disclosure statement in his presence before the I.O. and led them to the
place where he had concealed the weapon. In cross-examination, he admitted
that he signed on all the papers in the night of occurrence. P.W.5 is an
independent witness. He corroborated the statement of P.W.2 with regard to
assault to the injured (P.W.1) and the deceased. Nothing has been elicited from
his cross-examination to discredit his evidence. P.W.6 is another independent
witness. He also corroborated the evidence of P.Ws.2 and 5. P.W.10 is also an
independent witness who corroborated the evidence of P.Ws.2 and 5. In the
examination-in-chief, he specifically stated that when deceased challenged the
accused persons why they caused injury to his brother (P.W.1), co-accused
Ramulu and Prasad instigated the appellant to deal knife blow to the deceased.
Then appellant dealt knife blow to the chest of the deceased. Nothing has been
elicited by way of cross-examination from his mouth to belie his testimony.
P.W.11 is also an independent eye witness. He corroborated the version of PW.2
with regard to assault on P.W.1.          P.W.13 is another eye witness. She
corroborated the evidence of P.W.2 and specifically deposed that when Krishna
(deceased) arrived at the spot and objected, co-accused Ramulu and Prasad
directed the appellant to stab the deceased. Then the appellant dealt knife blow to
the left side chest of the deceased, as a result of which he sustained profuse
bleeding on his chest. Nothing has been elicited from her cross-examination to
disbelieve her testimony. P.W.7 is the doctor, who conducted autopsy over the
dead body of the deceased. He opined that the injury was caused to the vital
organs like heart and lungs which had given rise to a lot of bleeding leading to
shock and death. The injury was ante mortem in nature and sufficient in ordinary
course of nature to cause death. He also opined that M.O.I can cause such injury.
P.W.8 is the doctor, who examined P.W.1. He opined that the injury sustained by
P.W.1 was caused by M.O.I. P.W.9 is a police constable and a witness to the
inquest. P.W.14 is the I.O. who investigated into the matter and submitted charge
sheet against the appellant and two other co-accused persons under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_20">Sections
302</a>/<a href="/doc/724142/" id="a_21">324</a>/<a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_22">34</a> IPC. But in cross-examination he admitted that on 11.03.1997 at
about 2.30 PM the M.O.I was recovered and seizure list was prepared. He also
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                           6</span>



admitted that he recorded the statement of P.W.1 on the next day of the
occurrence, i.e., on 11.03.1997. He also admitted that he had issued medical
requisition to co-accused Garbapu Ramulu on 11.03.1997. The requisition and
the medical certificate were not available on record.
</p>
<p id="p_10">10.                   From the above analysis of the evidence, there is no dispute
that P.Ws.2, 5, 6, 10, 11 and 13 are witness to the occurrence and there is
nothing on record to disbelieve their evidence. P.W.1, the injured witness,
specifically stated in his evidence that he lost his sense immediately after seeing
the assault on his deceased brother and regained his sense after two days and
police recorded his statement three days after the occurrence.       But the I.O.,
P.W.14 specifically stated that he recorded the statement of P.W.1 on 11.03.1997,
i.e. the next day of the occurrence. In this view of the matter, this Court is not
inclined to accept the version of P.W.1. However, the evidence of P.Ws.2, 5, 6,
10, 11 and 13 which gained sufficient corroboration from the medical evidence is
found to be reliable. Therefore, taking into account the oral evidence of these
witnesses and the medical evidence, it can be safely deduced that it is the
appellant who assaulted the deceased and P.W.1.

<p id="p_11">11.                   Let us now examine whether leading to discovery has been
proved by the prosecution or not. The apex Court has ruled that for application of
<a href="/doc/1312051/" id="a_23">Section 27</a> of the Evidence Act, the following requirements are necessary to be
fulfilled by the prosecution:
</p>
<pre id="pre_2">               i)     The fact of which evidence sought to be                given
                      must be relevant to the issue;

              ii)     The fact must have been discovered in consequence of same
                      information received from the accused;

              iii)    The person giving information must be accused of the
                      offence; and

              iv)    he must be in custody of police.


</pre><p id="p_12">From the aforesaid, it emanates that discovery of a fact in consequence of
information from accused in custody must be proved. Only that portion of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                           7</span>



information which relates distinctly to the fact discovered can be proved and rest
is inadmissible. In this case, police arrested the accused on 11.03.1997 at about
12 noon. Thereafter, it is alleged, the accused-appellant gave the disclosure
statement to the police in presence of P.W.4 vide Ext.5, led them to the half
constructed house of one Babu Rao and brought out M.O.I from the heap of
bricks and the same was seized vide Ext.6. P.W.4 is said to be the witness to the
leading to discovery. But he admitted that he signed the police paper on the night
of occurrence, i.e., 10.03.1997 and that the accused disclosed the fact, led the
police and M.O.I was recovered at 2.30 P.M. Since there is discrepancy with
regard to date of seizure and arrest of the appellant, this Court is not inclined to
place reliance upon Exts.5 and 6.
</p>
<p id="p_13">                       In the instant case, although there are some material
omissions, such omissions have not been confronted either to the concerned
witnesses or to the investigating officer. Therefore, the accused cannot get any
benefit out of that.
</p>
<p id="p_14">                       As regards the so-called perfunctory investigation, the apex
Court in <a href="/doc/808611/" id="a_24">Baladin &amp; Ors. v. State of Uttar Pradesh</a>, AIR 1956 SC 181 has held
that the record by the investigating officer, shall be considered by the Court only
with a view to weighing the evidence actually adduced in Court. If the police
record becomes suspect or unreliable, as in the present case, on the ground that
it was deliberately perfunctory or dishonest, it loses much of its value. So, the
Court while judging the case of a particular accused has to weigh the evidence
given against him in Court keeping in view the fact that the earlier statements of
witnesses as recorded by the police is tainted record.         This ratio has been
followed by this Court in <a href="/doc/100888/" id="a_25">Premananda Saoo &amp; Ors. v. State of Orissa</a>, (2008) 41
OCR 558. Conjoint reading of evidence of P.Ws.2, 5, 6, 10, 11 and 13 clearly
establishes that the appellant assaulted the deceased and P.W.1. As such, the
so-called perfunctory investigation will not affect the prosecution case, particularly
when the evidence of the investigating officer is very clear and cogent and nothing
has been elicited from his mouth by way of cross-examination and nothing has
been confronted to him.
</p>
<p id="p_15">12.                    Now, it is to be seen whether the act committed by the
appellant comes within the ambit of <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_26">Section 302</a>, <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_27">IPC</a> or Section 304 Part-I, <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_28">IPC</a>.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                                  8</span>



<p id="p_16">        It is in the evidence that assault took place due to sudden provocation given by
        the deceased and apparently a single blow was dealt to the chest of the
        deceased. Therefore, taking into consideration the attending circumstances, this
        Court converts the conviction of the appellant from <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_29">Section 302</a>, <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_30">IPC</a> to Section
        304 Part-I, <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_31">IPC</a> and sentences him to undergo rigorous imprisonment for ten
        years. His conviction under <a href="/doc/724142/" id="a_32">Section 324</a> IPC is confirmed without imposing any
        separate sentence.
</p>
<p id="p_17">                             It is stated by Mr. Acharya that appellant Garbapu
        Venkatiramana by now has remained in custody for more than ten years. If that be
        so, the appellant be set at liberty forthwith, unless his detention is required
        otherwise.
