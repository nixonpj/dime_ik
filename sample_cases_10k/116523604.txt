04/01.04.2014</pre><p id="p_1">          The present anticipatory bail application has been filed under
               <a href="/doc/1783708/" id="a_1">Sections 438</a> and <a href="/doc/60736/" id="a_2">440</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure seeking
               anticipatory bail as the petitioner is having reasonable apprehension of his
               arrest in connection with Nagar Untari P.S. Case No. 146 of 2012
               corresponding to G.R. No. 1389 of 2012 registered for the offence
               punishable under <a href="/doc/1599401/" id="a_3">Sections 341</a>, <a href="/doc/1011035/" id="a_4">323</a>, <a href="/doc/988620/" id="a_5">406</a>, <a href="/doc/1944660/" id="a_6">384</a> and <a href="/doc/1436241/" id="a_7">420</a>/<a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_8">34</a> of the Indian
               Penal Code, which is now pending in the court of the learned S.D.J.M.,
               Garhwa.
</p><p id="p_2">                      The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the petitioner
               is an innocent person and has been falsely implicated in the alleged
               offence. It is further submitted that the petitioner is not connected in any
               manner whatsoever with the alleged offence and there is no chit of paper
               to show that even an agreement was made with the petitioner for taking
               water tank on rent nor he gave advance money to the informant. It is
               further submitted that the co-accused, Anjani Singh has taken the water
               tank of the informant and to this effect, a panchayat was also held. The
               very co-accused, Anjani Singh accepted his guilt and agreed to give the
               due money to the informant and the present petitioner was a witness in the
               said Panchayat proceedings. It is further submitted that the petitioner is a
               law abiding citizen and he is ready and willing to cooperate in the
               investigation and he shall abide by the terms and conditions that may be
               imposed by this Court.
</p><p id="p_3">                      The learned APP appearing on behalf of the State opposed the
               anticipatory bail application and submitted that the prosecution witnesses
               have supported the case in the case diary against the present petitioner and
               there is prima facie case against the present petitioner and therefore,
               looking to the nature of accusation and gravity of the offence, anticipatory
               bail may not be granted in favour of the present petitioner.
</p><p id="p_4">                      Considering the aforesaid rival submissions and having regard to
               facts and circumstances of the present case and more particularly, looking
               to the accusation made against the present petitioner, this Court is of the
               view that anticipatory bail is required to be granted in favour of the
               petitioner. Accordingly, in the event of his arrest or surrender within a
       period of two weeks from the date of this order, the petitioner, above
      named, is directed to be released on executing bail bond of Rs.10,000/-
      (Ten Thousand) with two sureties of the like amount each to the
      satisfaction of learned S.D.J.M., Garhwa in connection with Nagar Untari
      P.S. Case No. 146 of 2012 corresponding to G.R. No. 1389 of 2012
      subject to the conditions as laid down under <a href="/doc/1144664/" id="a_9">Section 438</a> (2)<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_10"> of the Code</a>
      of Criminal Procedure and further on the condition that the petitioner shall
      deposit Rs.18,000/- (Rupees eighteen thousand) before the learned court
      of S.D.J.M., Garhwa within a period of two weeks from the date of this
      order. After deposit of the said amount, the informant will be at liberty to
      move an application for withdrawal of the said amount. As and when such
      application is moved, the court below may permit him to withdraw the
      said amount by imposing appropriate condition as may be deemed fit and
      proper.
