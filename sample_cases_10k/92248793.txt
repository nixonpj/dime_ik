                  Per Navin Sinha, Acting Chief Justice

30/03/2015

</pre><p id="p_1">                 The present appeal arises from order dated 29.1.2015 dismissing Writ

             Petition No. 595 of 1995. The Learned Single Judge held that the Appellant was

             ineligible for the domicile certificate as he was not a resident of the then State of

             Madhya Pradesh. The termination of his service on that ground required no

             interference.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                       2</span><p id="p_2">

</p><p id="p_3">2.   Learned Counsel for the Appellant submits that he was initially appointed as

a daily-wage and subsequently regularised in service in the year 1986 preceded

by an open advertisement and selection. The advertisement contained a clause

that the candidate must produce a domicile certificate. This was contrary to Rule

88(3)(i)(a) of the Madhya Pradesh/Chhattisgarh Krishi Upaj Mandi (Mandi Nidhi

Lekha Tatha Rajya Vipnan Sewa Ki Gathan Ki Riti Tatha Anya Vishaya) Niyam,

1980 (hereinafter called 'the Rules'). If the clause of the advertisement was ultra

vires the Rules and the Appellant submitted any domicile certificate, it has no

relevance and cannot be a ground for termination. There is no other ineligibility

for appointment alleged against the Appellant. It was lastly submitted that the

Appellant has continued in service for the last 29 years and is now approaching

superannuation.
</p>
<p id="p_4">
</p><p id="p_5">3.   Learned Counsel for the State opposing the appeal submitted that the

advertisement contained a specific stipulation with regard to the applicant having

to be a domicile of the then State of Madhya Pradesh. It was next submitted that

the ground now being urged of the advertisement being ultra vires the Rules has

neither been pleaded nor was urged before the Learned Single Judge. The

question also arises if the post of Nakedar on which the Appellant had been

regularised, formed part of the cadre structure of the Samiti.


</p><p id="p_6">4. We have considered the submissions on behalf of the parties.


</p><p id="p_7">5.   The Appellant was appointed as a daily-wage on 5.11.1982 by Krishi Upaj

Mandi Samiti, Ambikapur. His regularisation by an order dated 6.10.1986 was

preceded by an advertisement dated 23.9.1986. One of the clauses in the

advertisement required the applicant to be a domicile of the then State of

Madhya Pradesh.
</p>
<p id="p_8">
</p><p id="p_9">6.   The Appellant was terminated on 5.5.1988 on the ground that he was not a

resident of the State of Madhya Pradesh which was one of the eligibility criteria
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                        3</span>

for appointment on the post of Nakedar, after complaints were made against

him. The appeal preferred against the same was also dismissed on 27.7.1992.

The Appellant preferred a revision before the State Government during the

pendency of which his domicile certificate was itself cancelled on 6.7.1992.


</p><p id="p_10">7.   The order of regularisation dated 6.10.1986 states that the Appellant was

being temporarily appointed on the regular post of Nakedar. The submission on

behalf of the State that Nakedar was not a cadre post of Samiti therefore does

not appeal to us. The pleadings in this regard at paragraph 8 of the counter-

affidavit is bald stating that the post does not come within the confines of the

State Marketing Services. This runs contrary to and is in teeth of the

regularisation order explicitly stating that Nakedar was a regular sanctioned post.


</p><p id="p_11">8.   The issue that the order of termination in violation of principles of natural

justice or that a show cause notice was given before the cancellation of the

domicile certificate need not engage the attention of the Court as the matter can

be disposed on another pure question of law otherwise.
</p>
<p id="p_12">
</p><p id="p_13">9.   Rule 88(3)(i)(a) of the Rules provides that any citizen of India was eligible to

apply. The advertisement which restricted the applicants to residents of State of

Madhya Pradesh only, was therefore ultra vires the Rules. If the Respondents

incorporated a condition in the advertisement contrary to the Rules, it is not open

for them to contend that the Appellant nonetheless submitted a false domicile

certificate. The question of domicile certificate was wholly irrelevant to the

appointment and completely superfluous to the controversy. The advertisement

being ultra vires was specifically pleaded in the writ petition.


</p><p id="p_14">10. The Respondents cannot be permitted to take advantage of their own wrong

in publishing the advertisement ultra vires the Rules. It is not the case of the

Respondents that the Appellant was not a citizen of India. Since we have arrived

at the conclusion that the action of the Respondents was completely ultra vires
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                               4</span>

        the Rules, it is the power under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1">Article 226</a> of the Constitution which has been

        invoked to set aside the order of termination. The writ petition is therefore held to

        be maintainable.
</p>
<p id="p_15">
</p><p id="p_16">        11. We are therefore unable to sustain the order under appeal which is

        accordingly set aside. The termination dated 5.5.1988 having been ordered on a

        singular ground is also not sustainable and is set aside.


</p><p id="p_17">        12. The appeal is allowed.
