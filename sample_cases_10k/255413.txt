                  ...........................................
                WP(C).NO. 28111                  OF 2009
                  ............................................
        DATED THIS THE          7TH DAY OF OCTOBER, 2009

                                JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">      The petitioner faces Ext.P9 issued on 10.9.2009 on the

basis of the report of Executive Engineer made on 7.9.2009. The

petitioner is called upon to vacate the premises on the ground

that the building in question is dangerous for human habitation.

The petitioner has placed Ext.P10 objection to Ext.P9. Having

regard to the nature of the objections taken in Ext.P10, it is

inappropriate that the petitioner is forced to quit without

consideration of those objections. I say this more particularly

because it appears that there are different other earlier matters

touching the building in question. Though the petitioner has also

made Ext.P11 before the appellate committee of the Corporation,

the decision of the first instance has to be taken by the authority

at the first instance. This is because Ext.P9 notice has been

issued presumably on the basis of facts disclosed by the report of

the Engineer.    Therefore, it is the authority of the first instance

that has to consider the objections to the contents of Ext.P9,

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">Wpc 28111/2009                    2</span>

which could be treated only as tentative. Hence, it is ordered

that the consideration of Ext.P11 shall not be made, as of now,

and the petitioner can take recourse to that, if the Secretary of

the Corporation ultimately decides against the petitioner after

consideration of Ext.P10. To enable a complete hearing process,

it is ordered that the petitioner will be issued a copy of the report

of the Engineer, that is relied on in Ext.P9. Let a decision follow

after hearing the petitioner and if necessary, by permitting the

petitioner to require further release by way of site inspection etc.

At any rate, having regard to grounds stated in Ext.P9, it is

ordered that the proceedings shall be concluded by the Secretary,

within a period of one month from now. Until then, further

proceedings on the basis of Ext.P9 will stand deferred and it

would be treated as a notice only. All other issues left open. Writ

petition ordered accordingly.
