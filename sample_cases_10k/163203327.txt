                     Jabalpur, Dated : 27-09-2019
                            Shri Praveen Kumar Verma, learned counsel for the applicant.
                            Shri Sandeep Singh, learned Government Advocate for the
                     respondent/State.</pre>
<p id="p_1">                            Heard on the question of admission and interim relief.
                            By this writ petition the petitioner who is working as Patwari has

                     challenged the transfer order dated 05.07.2019; whereby, she has been
                     transferred from Kesli To Shahgarh.
</p><p id="p_2">                            Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the transfer of the
                     petitioner is from one Sub-Division to another therefore, the order has not
                     been passed by the Competent Authority as required by Rule 7 of M. P.
                     Land Record Mannual. He further submits that, the husband of the petitioner
                     is posted at Kesli; therefore, in terms of the transfer policy husband and wife
                     should be posted together.
</p><p id="p_3">                            As against this learned counsel for the respondent State has opposed

                     the writ petition.
</p><p id="p_4">                            Having heard learned counsel for the parties and on perusal of the
                     record it is noticed that, the petitioner has been transferred on administrative
                     ground. The transfer is by the Deputy Collector acting for the Collector with
                     due approval of the concerned Minister. The alleged Rules 7 which the
                     petitioner is relying upon also empowers the Collector to pass the Inter Sub-
                     Division Transfer Orders. Hence, in the present case no illegality or infirmity
                     is found in the impugned transfer order.
</p><p id="p_5">                            So far as the contention of learned counsel for the petitioner that the
                     petitionerÃ¢Â€Â™s husband is posted at Kesli is concerned though it is the
                     policy of the State Government to keep the husband and wife at the same
                     place as far as possible but if the administrative exigency arises, then the

                     posting as per the need can always be done.
</p><p id="p_6">                            The impugned order has not been shown to have been passed in
                     violation of any statutory provision nor the mala fides have been shown. That
                     apart, learned counsel for the petitioner has also failed to point out as to since
                     when the petitioner is posted in the present place of posting. Therefore, it can
                     safely be presumed that the petitioner has completed the normal tenure of

                     three years. It is also worth noting that, the transfer is an incident of service
                     and mere violation of the transfer policy which is in the nature of
                     administrative instructions, interference in the order of transfer is not required.
</p><p id="p_7">                            The Division Bench of this Court in the matter of O.P. Sharma Vs.
                     M.P. State Agriculture Marketing Board, Bhopal and others, vide order dated
                     6.11.2017 passed in W.A. No.958/2017 considered the scope of interference
                     in such matter and has held as under:-
</p><p id="p_8">                            Ã¢Â€Âœ15. An order of transfer of an employee is a part of the
                     service conditions and such order of transfer is not required to be interfered
                     with lightly by a court of law in exercise of its discretionary jurisdiction unless
                     the Court finds that either the order is mala-fide or that the service rules
                     prohibit such transfer or that the authorities, who issued the order, had not the
                     competence to pass the order.
</p><p id="p_9">                            16. The Apex Court in the case of <a href="/doc/220487/" id="a_1">Union of India vs. S.L. Abbas</a>
                     (1993) 4 SCC 357, has observed that the Govt. instructions on transfer are
                     mere guidelines without any statutory force and the Court cannot interfere
                     with the order of transfer unless the said order is alleged to have been passed
                     by malice or where it is made in violation of the statutory provisions. Thus, it
                     is clear that the transfer
                     policy does not create any legal right in favour of the employee.
</p><p id="p_10">                            17. It is well settled that even if the transfer order is passed contrary to
                     the transfer policy then also the same cannot be a ground to be set aside the
                     transfer order. The writ petition of the appellant regarding his repatriation is
                     pending before Principal Seat at Jabalpur
