<p id="p_2">

</p><p id="p_3">                          2.    The respondent herein has filed the claim petition, claiming a sum of

                   Rs.5,00,000/- (Rupees Five Lakhs Only) as compensation. According to the

                   claimant on 11.06.1994 at about 10.30 am, while he was boarding the bus bearing

                   registration No. TN-23- 0228 at Thiruthani bus stand along with other passengers,
http://www.judis.nic.in
                   the driver of the bus, without noticing the passengers boarding the bus, has
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                                             2</span>

                   suddenly started the bus, as a result of which the claimant's leg got struck in

                   between the wheels and he sustained grievous injuries.



</p><p id="p_4">                          3.     According to the claimant, at the time of accident, he was aged about

                   45 years, working as an agricultural work and power Tiller Driver, earning a sum of

                   Rs.150/- per day. It was also claimed that soon after the accident, he had taken

                   treatment as an in-patient at Government Hospital, Chennai from 11.06.1994 for a

                   period of two months.
</p>
<p id="p_5">

</p><p id="p_6">                          4.     The claim petition was resisted by the Transport Corporation by

                   contending that on 11.06.1994, the driver of the bus had started the bus slowly

                   from the bus stand. At the time of accident the claimant was in an inebriated

                   condition, due to which, he could not board the bus and due to his own negligence,

                   he fell off from the bus. The bus was started from the bus stand after noticing the

                   passengers boarding it. While so, it cannot be said that the driver of the bus started

                   it negligently, without noticing the claimant boarding the bus.       The Transport

                   Corporation also denied as in correct the nature of injuries sustained by the

                   claimant, period of his hospitalisation and his avocation.



</p><p id="p_7">                          5.     Before the Tribunal, the claimant examined himself as PW.1 and

                   Dr.Dharmaraj was examined as PW.2 and Ex.P1 to P9 were marked. On behalf of

                   the Transport Corporation neither any witness was examined nor any document

                   marked before the Tribunal. On considering the oral and documentary evidence,

                   the Tribunal held that the accident was caused due to the negligence of the driver
http://www.judis.nic.in
                   of the bus. As regards the quantum of compensation the Tribunal noted the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                                               3</span>

                   evidence of PW.2 / Dr.Dharamaraj and concluded that claimant sustained injuries

                   on his right leg and his foot was crushed. The Tribunal has also taken note of the

                   age and disability assessed by the Doctor/ PW.2 at 50% and proceeded to award a

                   total sum of Rs.2,10,000/- as compensation, the break-up of which are as follows:

</p><pre id="pre_2">                          1.   Disability               -      Rs.60,000/-
                          2.   Transport Expenses       -      Rs.10,000/-
                          3.   Medical Expenses         -      Rs.30,000/-
                          4.   Pain and Suffering       -      Rs.50,000/-
                          5.   Loss of earning power    -      Rs.60,000/-
                                                            --------------------
                                           Total        -     Rs.2,10,000/-
                                                            ---------------------


</pre><p id="p_8">                               6.    The learned counsel appearing for the appellant would contend that

                   the Tribunal has awarded an exorbitant amount as compensation to the claimant,

                   without taking note of the earnings of the claimant. The Tribunal proceeded to

                   award a sum of Rs.60,000/- towards loss of earning power in favour of the claimant

                   apart from awarding another sum of Rs.60,000/- towards disability. It is also stated

                   that the disability as assessed by the Doctor at 50% is excessive as the respondent

                   only sustained a fracture injury. In any event the award passed by the Tribunal is

                   not in consonance with the nature of injury sustained by the claimant and the period

                   of his hospitalisation, therefore, he prayed for setting aside the award passed by

                   the Tribunal.
</p>
<p id="p_9">

</p><p id="p_10">                               7.    The learned counsel for the rspondent would contend that even

                   though the appellant/Corporation opposed the claim petition and disputed the

                   nature of injury sustained by the claimant and the period of his hospitalisation, the

                   corporation has not chosen to file any documentary evidence to disprove the same.
http://www.judis.nic.in
                   The Corporation also did not examine any one before the Tribunal. In any event,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                                            4</span>

                   the respondent has proved the nature of injury sustained by him not only by

                   producing oral and documentary evidence, but by examining PW2, Doctor.

                   According to the counsel for the respondent, the Tribunal, taking note of the

                   documentary evidence filed by the claimant/respondent, has awarded a just and

                   reasonable compensation, which does not call for any interference by this Court.



</p><p id="p_11">                          8.    Heard both sides and perused the materials placed on record. It is

                   observed from the claim petition that the claimant underwent treatment for a very

                   long period both at Government Hospital, Chennai and in a private hospital and that

                   has been proved by documents filed by him before the Tribunal. The claim was

                   made by the petitioner is at Rs.5,00,000/- and the Tribunal, taking note of the oral

                   and documentary evidence as a proof of such claim made by the claimant, has

                   awarded compensation under various heads. It is also brought to the notice of this

                   Court that the claimant had underwent two to three surgeries for the injuries

                   sustained by him. It is also seen from the deposition of the claimant, as PW1 that

                   due to the injuries sustained, he cannot walk without the support of the walking

                   stick. Having regard to the same, the Doctor, PW2 had assessed the disability of

                   the claimant at 50%, which, in the opinion of this Court, could be raised to 60%.

                   Resultantly, the amount awarded under the head of disability has to be enhanced

                   to 75,000 from Rs.60,000/- which, in the opinion of this Court, will meet the ends of

                   justice.

                   M.A.C.T.O.P.No. 130 of 2002 on the file of the Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal,

                   by the Tribunal. The Appellant /Transport Corporation is directed to deposit the

                   enhanced compensation amount along with interest at the rate of 7.5% per annum

                   to the credit of M.A.C.T.O.P.No. 130 of 2002 on the file of the Motor Accidents

                   Claims Tribunal, (Additional Sub–Court), Chengalpattu, after adjusting the amount,

                   if any, already deposited, within a period of four weeks from the date of receipt of

                   this judgment and on such deposit, the claimant is permitted to withdraw the

                   compensation amount. The respondent/claimant is directed to pay the additional

                   court fee for the enhanced award amount.
