<p id="p_1">                                Challenge in this petition is to the order dated 07.08.2015

            (Annexure P-6) passed by the Civil Judge (Senior Division), Roopnagar

            (executing Court), whereby objections filed by the judgment debtors-

            petitioners during execution of the judgment and decree dated 19.11.2009

            have been dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_2">                                Perusal of the judgment and decree dated 19.11.2009 (Annexure

            P-1) shows that the objections raised by the Audit Department vide Endst.

            No.1308 dated 19.10.2005 has been considered and no direction has been

            given by the trial Court for recovery of arrears of pay on account of wrong

            fixation of pay. This was the main objection raised by the petitioners before

            the executing Court. The trial Court has observed that it was admitted by

            Tarsem Chand, SDO (DW-1) that Ex.P34 was in relation to fixation of pay of

            one Sudesh Kumar Jain, JE, who on completion of 8 years had been given the

            pay scale of Rs.2200-3900 w.e.f. 01.01.1986.

                                The plaintiff-respondent (decree holder) had retired after

            rendering 30 years of service. The policy with regard to fixation of pay had

            undertaken a change on 24.04.2001 and the employees were granted two

            proficiency step up increments, one w.e.f. 01.01.1986 in the pay scale of

            2200-3900 and the other after completion of 18 years w.e.f. 01.01.1996. The

            plaintiff-respondent was held entitled to 8 years proficiency step up w.e.f.

            01.01.1986. He was further held entitled to 24 years proficiency step up and

            revised pay scale w.e.f. 01.01.1996. The trial Court has also held that the

            Internal Audit dated 19.10.2005, which pointed out that pay of the plaintiff

            had been wrongly fixed, has been rejected, as the re-fixation vide letter dated

            24.10.2007 issued by Executive Engineer, Canal Lining Division No.1,

            Bathinda, was as per the proficiency step up after attaining/completion of 8,

            18 and 24 years as per Ex.D4.

<p id="p_4">                                Once the trial Court had rejected the objection dated 19.10.2005

            and no direction for recovery had been given, the impugned order dated

            07.08.2015 dismissing the objections of the judgment debtors-petitioners,

            does not require any interference.
