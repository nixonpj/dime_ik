Vikas   Raghav.   Therefore,   the   accused   was   alleged   to   have   committed 

offences   under   <a href="/doc/1270101/" id="a_3">Sections   279</a>/<a href="/doc/1402213/" id="a_4">337</a>/<a href="/doc/409589/" id="a_5">304</a>­A   <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_6">IPC</a>.     After   the   completion   of   the 

investigation, the charge­sheet was filed against the accused.

examined four witnesses.

18167 of the injured Vikas Raghav prepared by Dr. Ramesh Kumar Pandey 

as Ex PW­1/A.  She was not cross­examined on behalf of the accused.</p><pre id="pre_2">



5         PW­2 Vikas Raghav was the eye­witness of this case.     He deposed 



FIR No. 338/2007                          STATE V/s DINESH KUMAR                                                           PAGE No.2/6
</pre><p id="p_3"> that  in the  month  of August  of the  year 2007  he  alongwith  his friend  was 

going towards his resident on his bike bearing no.DL 4SBD 3170.  He further 

deposed that he was driving the bike and his friend Amit Sharma was sitting 

as a pillion rider.  He further deposed that when they were crossing the Red 

light of Vikas Puri and going towards Madhuban Chowk, one truck came from 

behind and hit his bike due to which they both fell down alongwith bike. He 

further deposed that he became unconscious after the accident.  



6           However, his testimony was disowned by Ld. APP and he preferred to 

cross­examine   the   witness.     In   his   cross­examination   by   the   Ld.   APP   he 

admitted that the accident occurred in the noon.   He stated that he did not 

remember   the   date.   However,   the   accident   was  occurred   in   the   month   of 

August 2007. Police came at hospital and inquired him about the accident 

and   obtained   his   signatures   on   his   statement   vide   Ex.PW2/A.   After   the 

accident he was shifted to DDU hospital by PCR Van.     His statement Ex. 

PW­2/A was shown and read over to the witness who denied that he made 

such   statement.   He   stated   that   police   obtained   his   signatures   on   blank 

papers. He denied that the statement Ex.PW2/A was voluntary made by him. 

He stated that he cannot admit or deny that the number of the offending truck 

was CH 01G 0441. He denied that accused who was present in the Court on

 that day was driving the offending truck in a rash and negligent manner and 

caused the accident and at the time of accident he was having one name 

plate on which his name was written as Dinesh Kumar. (Confronted with the 

statement Ex.PW2/A where it is so recorded). He denied that   the accused 

was arrested at his instance and arrest memo Ex.PW2/B.  He was not cross­

examined by the Ld. Defence Counsel.

7          PW­3 Devender was the cousin of the deceased.  He deposed that on 

05.07.2007, he had identified the dead body of the deceased Amit Sharma in 

the Mortuary of the DDU Hospital vide Identification Memo as Ex. PW­3/A.  In 

his cross­examination by the Ld. Defence Counsel, he stated that he had not 

seen the accident.

8          PW­4 ASI Jai Prakash was the DO who registered and proved the FIR 

on the record as Ex. PW­4/A and endorsement on the record as Ex. PW­4/B.



9          In this case, PW­2 Vikas Raghav was the star and the eye witness of 

the prosecution.  Perusal of the testimonies of PW­2 revealed that he has not 

supported the case of the prosecution at all despite the cross­examination by 

the   Ld.   APP   for   the   State.   He   has   deposed   about   the   rashness   and 



FIR No. 338/2007                          STATE V/s DINESH KUMAR                                                           PAGE No.4/6
 negligence on the part of the driver of one truck but he did not depose about 

the   number   of   the   truck   which   hit   his   bike   from   behind.     In   the   cross­

examination by the Ld. APP, he did not admit or deny the suggestion that the 

number of the truck was CH­01G­0441.  He denied the suggestion of the Ld. 

APP that accused present in the Court was driving the afore said truck.  He 

further denied that the accused was arrested at his instance.  He has failed to 

identify the accused as the offender.   The identification of the accused as an 

offender in this case has not been proved at all by the prosecution.   Apart 

from   PW­2   Vikas   Raghav,   there   is   no   other   eye   witness   cited   by   the 

prosecution in this case.    Since, this witness has turned hostile and did not 

support   the   case   of   the   prosecution   at   all   hence,   finding   that   no   purpose 

would be served with the continuance of prosecution evidence, the same was 

closed. It would have been a futile exercise. The other witnesses examined in 

this case were only  of corroborative nature and their testimonies would not 

have been sufficient to bring home the guilt of the accused. There is nothing 

on   the   record   to   suggest   that   the   offence   has   been   committed   by   the 

accused.   Not a figment of the evidence has come on the record against the 

accused. Since, nothing incriminating has come against the accused in the 

evidence, therefore, SA of the accused was also  dispensed with.
