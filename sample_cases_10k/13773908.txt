           HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE SANDEEP MEHTA
                        Judgment / Order
09/11/2017

     Heard learned counsel for the parties. Perused the record.

     The instant revision is directed against the order dated

18.6.2016 passed by the learned Additional Sessions Judge No.3,

Jodhpur Metropolitan in Appeal No.3/2016 (NCV No.110/2016).

The petitioner herein was arraigned as an accused before the

learned Metropolitan Magistrate No.3, Jodhpur Metropolitan in

complaint no.120/2015 (111/2014) preferred by the complainant

respondent no.2 for the offence under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_1">Section 138</a> of Negotiable

Instruments Act. The trial Court proceeded to convict the

petitioner for the offence under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_2">Section 138</a> of Negotiable

Instruments Act vide judgment dated 15.3.2016 and sentenced

him to 6 months' S.I. and also directed that he shall make
                                  (2 of 4)




payment of Rs.1 lakh by way of compensation to the respondent

no.2. The respondent no.2 complainant as well as the petitioner

challenged the said judgment passed by the trial Court by filing

separate appeals. Whilst the complainant prayed for enhancement

of the sentence awarded to the petitioner, on the other hand the

petitioner challenged his conviction. The appellate Court, whilst

deciding the appeals, rather then considering the same on merits,

held that the direction given by the trial Court in the judgment

dated 15.3.2016 to the effect that the petitioner shall make

payment of compensation to the tune of Rs.1 lakhs to the

complainant was unsustainable because unless fine was imposed,

compensation    could    not   be    awarded   to   the   complainant.

Compensation could only be recovered from the fine imposed

upon the accused. Thus, the matter was remanded to the trial

Court for rehearing the arguments on the aspect of sentences

awarded to the accused and to decide the matter afresh. The

instant revision is directed against the remand order dated

18.6.2016.

     Learned   counsel    Shri   Himmat     Jagga   representing   the

petitioner urges that the appellate Court ought to have considered

the appeal of the petitioner on merits rather than remanding the

matter to the trial Court on a hypertechnical aspect.

     Learned counsel Shri Vikram Choudhary representing the

complainant also urges that the appellate Court committed grave

legal error while deciding the appeal in the above manner. He

contends that the direction given by the trial Court while directing
                               (3 of 4)




the petitioner to pay compensation to the complainant without

imposing fine upon him was simply a technical error and could

have been cured by the appellate Court.

     Both the learned counsels thus urge that the matter be

remanded to the appellate Court to consider the appeal on merits

and to decide the same afresh as per law.

     Having appreciated the arguments advanced at Bar and after

going through the impugned order, this Court is of the firm opinion

that the appellate Court adopted a totally hypertechnical approach

whilst remanding the matter to the trial Court for rehearing the

matter on the aspect of sentences. True it is that the trial Court

should have directed recovery of compensation by inflicting fine on

the accused but the said flaw in the trial Court's judgment was a

mere irregularity and could have been cured by the appellate

Court itself. In any event, without considering the appeal on

merits, there was no occasion for the appellate Court to have

straight off jumped to the aspect of the sentences. The appeals

should   have   been   considered    first   on   merits   and   if   the

circumstances so warranted, the matter thereafter could have

been remanded to the trial Court on the aspect of the sentences if

so desired.

     In this background, the instant revision deserves acceptance

and is hereby allowed. The impugned order dated 18.6.2016

passed by the learned Additional Sessions Judge No.3, Jodhpur

Metropolitan is quashed and set aside. The matter is remanded to

the appellate Court who shall restore the appeal filed by the
                               (4 of 4)




petitioner accused Nandu Singh to its original number and proceed

to decide the same afresh after providing opportunity of hearing to

the parties.

     Stay petition also stands disposed of.

     Record be sent back forthwith.
