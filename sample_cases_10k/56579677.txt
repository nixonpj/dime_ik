16/02/2017

            This civil misc. appeal has been filed

against the impugned judgment and award under
appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_2">            Brief    facts    of    the    case    are     that    a

claim petition was filed by the claimant/s with

regard to an accident involved in it whereby

he/they claimed compensation.

</p><p id="p_3">            Notices     to    the   claim        petition      were

issued to the opposite side. Written statement

to the claim petition was filed. On the basis

of the pleading of both the parties the learned

Tribunal framed the issues. After hearing both

the parties, the learned tribunal passed the

impugned       Judgment       and       award.    Against       the
                               (2 of 3)
                                                            [CMA-8/2008]

impugned judgment and award instant civil misc.

</p>
<p id="p_4">         I have heard learned counsel for the

respective parties and carefully scanned the

entire material made available to me.

</p><p id="p_5">         Prima facie this Court is of the view

that    the     matter       is     required        to    be    re-

investigated/re-enquired,                therefore,       certain

directions need to be issued to the concerned

Tribunal.      Hence,    this     appeal       is   disposed      of

with the following directions:

</p><p id="p_6">1.       The learned Tribunal is directed to re-

enquire in the matter at its own discretion and
during the course of enquiry if it finds that

the    claim    case    is    based       on   false      facts     &amp;

evidence, in such circumstances, the judgment

and award of the learned Tribunal shall remain

as it is and if the claim case is filed on

wrong facts &amp; evidence, then an FIR shall be

registered in accordance with law.

</p><p id="p_7">2.       If during the course of inquiry, the

claim case is found on true facts &amp; evidence,

in such circumstances, the impugned judgment/

award passed by the learned Tribunal deem to

have    been    treated      as      quashed.       The   learned

Tribunal after hearing both the parties shall
                                     (3 of 3)
                                                                        [CMA-8/2008]

decide the claim case afresh in accordance with

law.
</p>
<p id="p_8">3.         Both the parties are directed to remain

present         before        the        learned           Tribunal           on

5.7.2017.
</p>
<p id="p_9">4.         If    the     claimant/s              want/s      to    withdraw

within      one       month     from            .5.7.2017         then      the

withdraw         the         claim         case        and        in        such

circumstances           the     impugned              judgment/          award

shall be deemed to have been confirmed.

</p><p id="p_10">5.         The       amount     of       interim        award          ie   Rs.
25,000/-        received       by      the       claimant         appellant
