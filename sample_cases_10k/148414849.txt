BRIEF FACTS AND REASONS FOR DECISION :

</pre><p id="p_1">1.         Briefly stated the facts of the case are that accused Constable Raj



                                                                       Cont....
</p><p id="p_2">                                                                                    .
</p>
<p id="p_3">     Kumar was on duty outside House No. 10 when he along with co-accused

     Jasvinder Singh voluntarily caused grievous hurt on the person of

     complainant Rajesh Jain. It is also alleged against accused Ct. Raj Kumar

     that he took out his service revolver and threatened the complainant

     Rajesh Jain to kill him In this case, PCR Van was called at the spot but no

     FIR was registered. Finally, the FIR was registered on 02.01.1998 and the

     accused Constable Raj Kumar was arrested and later on released on bail.

     IO later sought permission to arrest the accused Jasvinder Singh . IO

     completed the investigation and thereafter file the challan in the court.

</p><p id="p_4">2.             Both the accused persons were summoned by my Ld. Predecessor

     and after supplying the copies, a charge under section506 (Part II) <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_3">IPC</a> r/w

     <a href="/doc/1133601/" id="a_4">Section 325</a>/<a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_5">34</a> IPC was framed against accused Constable Raj Kumar and

     charge under <a href="/doc/1133601/" id="a_6">section 325</a>/<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_7">34IPC</a> was framed against accused Jasvinder

     Singh .
</p>
<p id="p_5">3.             In order to prove its case, prosecution examined eight witnesses

     in all. PW-1 is complainant Rajesh Jain, PW-2 is the Duty Officer, PW-3

     is the record clerk who proved the MLC of the injured. PW-4 Anil

     Kaushik is the public witness and was stated to be the eye witness. PW-5

                                                                            Cont....
</p><p id="p_6">                                                                                 .
</p>
<p id="p_7">     SI Jagpal Singh was the initial IO who went to the spot who had received

     copy of the DD Number 18A which was regarding an accident between a

     cycle and a car but he did not find any accident and victim. He recorded

     the statements of both Constable Raj Kumar as well as Rajesh Jain but did

     not take any action against anyone. PW-6 Ct. Ram Partap was also the

     alleged eye witness who was present at the spot. PW-7 Ct. Thakur Dayal

     was also stated to be the eye witness present at the spot. PW-8 is SI Kanta

     Parshad who is IO of the case.
</p>
<p id="p_8">4.           The statement of both the accused persons were recorded under

     <a href="/doc/224316/" id="a_8">section 281</a>/<a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_9">313</a> Cr.P.C. wherein accused persons denied the case of the

     prosecution and claimed themselves to be innocent.

</p><p id="p_9">5.           In their defence , accused persons examined DW-1 ASI Ramphal,

     who was the incharge of the PCR Gypsy , who went to the spot

     immediately after the incident.
</p>
<p id="p_10">6.           I have heard Ld. APP for the state and Ld. defence counsel and

     carefully gone through the record and the evidence and the documents

     proved on record by the prosecution and the defence witness.

</p><p id="p_11">7.           In this case, PW-1 complainant, PW-4 Anil Kaushik, PW-6 Ct.

</p><p id="p_12">                                                                         Cont....
</p><p id="p_13">                                                                                  .
</p>
<p id="p_14">     Ram Partap, PW-7 Ct. Thakur Dayal (eye witnesses) and DW-1 ASI

     Ramphal are the material witnesses. Upon perusal of the testimony of PW-

     4, PW-6 and PW-7 , it is seen that all these three witnesses are totally

     hostile to the prosecution case. They were the eye witnesses. PW-4 is a

     public witness, infact, was known to the complainant Rajesh Jain, but did

     not support the version of the complainant. PW-6 and PW-7 were present

     on duty near the spot of incident have also not supported the story of the

     complainant.
</p>
<p id="p_15">8.           It is also seen that the defence witness DW-1 ASI Ramphal who

     was the incharge of the Police Gypsy and who reach the spot immediately

     after the incident . He did not support the story of the prosecution and,

     infact, stated that the car of the complainant met with an accident with a

     cyclist. He also stated that the complainant was drunk at the time of

     incident and he handed him over to the Local police which came to the

     spot.
</p>
<p id="p_16">9.           It is also seen that there is delay in lodging the FIR. The incident

     is of 24.11.1997 and the FIR as lodged on 02.01.1998 i.e. after a delay of

     1½ months and the delay has not been satisfactorily explained by the

                                                                          Cont....
</p><p id="p_17">                                                                                .
</p>
<p id="p_18">  prosecution which creates doubt in the story of the prosecution.

</p><p id="p_19">10.           It is also pointed out by the Ld. defence counsel that there are

  major contradictions in the story of the complainant. In his cross-

  examination, he had admitted that his statement was never recorded by the

  police except on the date of incident. However, it is seen that as per the

  statement of the IO, the investigation started on 02.01.1998 but it is

  surprising that how the subsequent statement of the complainant were

  recorded by the IO when the complainant himself denies having met the

  police after the day of incident. It is also seen that the complainant states

  that PCR came to the spot but the PCR Incharge (DW-1) does not

  corroborate the story of the complainant but states that the car driven by

  the complainant met with an accident with the cyclist. It is also seen that

  the complainant was not able to identify who gave the Danda blow and

  was confronted with respect to the manner in which he had received

  injuries.
</p>
<p id="p_20">11.           On the other hand, Learned APP has argued that the statement of

  the complainant should be relied upon and even though the other eye

  witnesses of the prosecution are hostile, he states that the accused should

                                                                        Cont....
</p><p id="p_21">                                                                                 .
</p>
<p id="p_22">  be convicted on the basis of sole testimony of the complainant.

</p><p id="p_23">12.        It is seen that all the three eye witnesses of the prosecution are

  totally hostile to the case of the complainant. Even DW-1 who was the

  Incharge of PCR Gypsy who reached the spot immediately after the

  incident did not support the complainant.           There are number of

  contradictions in the story of the complainant and these inconsistencies

  along with the hostility of the prosecution witnesses are sufficient to create

  a doubt in the mind of the court. I am of the considered opinion that the

  benefit of doubt has to be given to the accused persons. In these

  circumstances, I am of the considered opinion that both the accused

  persons are entitled for acquittal. Ordered accordingly. Bail bonds are

  canceled. Sureties are discharged. File be consigned to Record Room.</p><pre id="pre_3">
