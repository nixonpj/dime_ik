                          passed in WP.No.14234 of 2011, by which the learned Single Judge

                          set aside the punishment of dismissal from service imposed on the

                          petitioner and modified it to one of compulsory retirement with

                          effect from the date of dismissal of service by the 4th respondent.

                          17(b) of Tamil Nadu Civil Services (D &amp; A) Rules on 08.01.2008. An

                          enquiry was conducted and the enquiry officer found the charges to

                          be proved by minutes dated 20.08.2008. A second show-cause notice

                          was served to the writ petitioner to show-cause as to why the

                          punishment of termination should not be imposed against him. The

                          writ petitioner gave his explanation. By an order dated 20.03.2009,

                          the Superintendent, Central Prison, Cuddalore, found that the writ

                          petitioner had violated Rule No.126,127,128(1) of Tamil Nadu Prison

                          Rules, 1983 and Rule 20(1) of the Tamil Nadu Government Servant

                          Conduct Rules. Disciplinary Authority agreed with the findings of the

                          enquiry officer and imposed the punishment of termination of

                          accepted the findings of the Disciplinary Authority and found that the

                          punishment of termination of service is not required to be modified.

                          The respondent thereafter gave a petition before the Government

                          and    the    Government    issued   G.O.(D).No.465,   Home      (Pri-2)

                          2011, challenging the order of dismissal of service. In the writ

                          petition, apart from challenging the legality of the order terminating

                          the writ petitioner from service, the writ petitioner has stated that

                          he has crossed the age of 50 and had put in 20 years of service and

                          therefore his case should be considered sympathetically. He has also

                          urged that the punishment is shockingly disproportionate to the

                          misconduct.

                          petitioner/respondent had deserted the service. Instances of

                          previous unauthorized absence have also been mentioned in the

                          counter.

</p><p id="p_12">                                 7. The learned Single Judge after hearing both the sides, came

                          to a conclusion that the charge has been proved. The learned Single

                          Judge took note of the contention of the Government Pleader that

                          the retention of service of the writ petitioner was not in public

                          interest and therefore he should be rightly dismissed from service.

                          The learned Single Judge however held that the punishment of

                          dismissal from service would not only affect the employee himself

                          but also his family members, as the livelihood of the petitioner's

                          family is irreversibly affected. The learned Single Judge held that,

                          while imposing a penalty or dismissal from service, it is incumbent

                          upon the authorities to take into consideration the fact that the

                          livelihood of the employee is at stake.

                          that for the charge of unauthorized absence, a penalty of dismissal

                          from service is rather excessive and not warranted the punishment of

                          termination of voluntary retirement from service. It is this order

                          which is challenged in the instant writ appeal.

                          Department and he cannot be absent without permission taking into

                          consideration the nature of work he has been assigned. The learned

                          Government Pleader also stated that the punishment is not

                          disproportionate to the misconduct alleged against the respondent.

                          On the other hand, the learned counsel for the respondent would

                          contend that the punishment is shockingly disproportionate to the

                          misconduct as alleged.

                          been confirmed by the Appellate Authority, by the Government. Once

                          the charge has been proved, the question that arises is as to whether

                          a High Court while exercising discretion under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1">Article 226</a> of the

                          Constitution of India, should interfere with the punishment imposed.

                          Apart from stating that, generally this Court has not awarded

                          punishment of dismissal from service in case of unauthorized

                          absence, there is no explanation as to why in this case the

                          punishment is shockingly disproportionate to the alleged misconduct.

                                 justified in interfering with the punishment imposed by the
                                 disciplinary authority. A Constitution Bench of this Court
                                 in <a href="/doc/458404/" id="a_2">State of Orissa v. Bidyabhushan Mohapatra</a> [AIR 1963 SC 779
                                 : (1963) 1 LLJ 239] held that having regard to the gravity of
                                 the established misconduct, the punishing authority had the
                                 power and jurisdiction to impose punishment. The penalty was
                                 not open to review by the High Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_3">Article 226.</a> If the

                                 Court had no jurisdiction to direct the Governor to review the
                                 penalty. It was further held that if the order was supported on
                                 any finding as to substantial misconduct for which punishment
                                 “can lawfully be imposed”, it was not for the Court to
                                 consider whether that ground alone would have weighed with
                                 the authority in dismissing the public servant. The Court had
                                 no jurisdiction, if the findings prima facie made out a case of
                                 misconduct, to direct the Governor to reconsider the order of

                                 same. In that case, the finding was that the appellant was to

                                 of the authority. It would be seen that this Court did not
                                 appear to have intended to lay down that in no case, the High

                                 disciplinary matters and nature of punishment. On the facts in
                                 that case, since the appellate authority had not adverted to
                                 the relevant facts, it was remitted to the appellate authority

                                 that the disciplinary authority, and on appeal the appellate
                                 authority, being fact-finding authorities have exclusive power
                                 to consider the evidence with a view to maintain discipline.
                                 They are invested with the discretion to impose appropriate
                                 punishment keeping in view the magnitude or gravity of the
                                 misconduct. The High Court/Tribunal, while exercising the
                                 power of judicial review, cannot normally substitute its own
                                 conclusion on penalty and impose some other penalty. If the

                                  conscience of the court. In the instant case, the disciplinary
                                  authority has come to the conclusion that the respondent lacked
                                  integrity. No doubt, there are no measurable standards as to
                                  what is integrity in service jurisprudence but certainly there are
                                  indicators for such assessment. Integrity according to Oxford
                                  Dictionary is “moral uprightness; honesty”. It takes in its sweep,
