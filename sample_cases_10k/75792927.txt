HONBLE SRI JUSTICE GUDISEVA SHYAM PRASAD            

CRIMINAL PETITION No. 10002 of 2013   

ORDER:  
</pre>
<p id="p_1">      This criminal petition is filed under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_1">Section 482</a>
Cr.P.C., to quash the proceedings in DVC No.12 of 2013 on
the file of Additional Judicial Magistrate of First Class, at
Armoor (for short, the trial Court).
</p>
<p id="p_2">2.      Brief facts of the case are that the 1st respondent
herein is the wife of one Muthyapu Hareesh, who is the 1st
respondent in DVC No.12 of 2013.  The petitioners herein
are respondents 3 to 7 in the said DVC No.12 of 2013.
</p><p id="p_3">      The 1st respondent filed an application before the trial
Court under <a href="/doc/1933289/" id="a_2">Section 12</a> of the Protection of Women from
<a href="/doc/542601/" id="a_3">Domestic Violence Act</a>, 2005 (for short, the DVC Act)
seeking reliefs under <a href="/doc/1860699/" id="a_4">Sections 18</a>, <a href="/doc/1130386/" id="a_5">19</a>, <a href="/doc/485875/" id="a_6">20</a> and <a href="/doc/1797053/" id="a_7">22</a> of the Act.
</p><p id="p_4">      It is alleged in the complaint filed by the 1st
respondent that her marriage was performed with her
husband on 17.11.2010 in Kalyana Mandapam in Armoor    
village of Nizamabad District, and at the time of marriage,
her parents have presented gold weighing 25 tolas,  kg
silver to her husband, and 2 tolas gold to her apart from
house hold articles, furniture and cash of Rs.1,00,000/-.
After marriage, she resided with her husband in her
matrimonial house and the petitioners 1 and 2 who are
sisters of her husband have quarreled with her saying that
her parents presented 1 tola of gold but it weighed only 10
grams and not 12 grams and also whether she had any  
boyfriend before marriage.  It is alleged that she has done
MCA and her husband has not done graduation and,  
therefore, he developed inferiority complex and started
harassing her by coming home in drunken condition and 
beating her saying whether she received any call from her
boyfriend.  It is also alleged that petitioners 1 and 2 used to
instigate her husband saying that he is handsome and
therefore they would perform another marriage to him with
a beautiful girl as the complainant is not beautiful.  It is
also alleged that her husband and in-laws demanded 
additional dowry and when her parents came to her
matrimonial house at Jagtial to invite her husband and in-
laws for Sankranti festival, they said they would come only
if they were presented gold.  It is alleged that her husband
complained about her chastity and father in law beat her
and they obtained her signatures on blank papers.  Unable
to bear their harassment, the defacto complainant filed the
aforesaid DVC case against her husband and in-laws. 
</p><p id="p_5">      Seeking to quash the proceedings in DVC No.12 of
2013, the petitioners herein, who are respondents 3 to 7 in
the said DVC, filed the present criminal petition.
</p>
<p id="p_6">3.      Heard the arguments of learned counsel for the
petitioners and the learned Public Prosecutor and the
learned counsel for 2nd respondent-defacto complainant.
</p>
<p id="p_7">4.      Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that the
petitioners 1 and 2 herein are the sisters of the respondent
No.1 in the DVC No.12 of 2013, and petitioners 3 and 4
herein are their husbands.  It is submitted that the
petitioners herein were residing at different places and they
are in no way connected with the commission of acts of
domestic violence and therefore they cannot be roped in
along with the husband who was residing with the defacto
complainant and therefore sought for quashing of
proceedings against the petitioners herein.
</p>
<p id="p_8">5.      Learned Public Prosecutor submits that in view of the
judgment rendered by this Court in GIDUTHURI KESARI   
KUMAR AND ORS. V/s. STATE OF TELANGANA AND            
ORS ., wherein it was clearly held that the proceedings
under <a href="/doc/1860699/" id="a_8">section 18</a> to <a href="/doc/1797053/" id="a_9">22</a> are in the nature of civil reliefs,
therefore, the petition for quashing the proceedings under
<a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_10">section 482</a> Cr.P.C., is not maintainable.  In the said
judgment this Court held at para No.10 as under:
</p><p id="p_9">10)     So, a study of statement of objects and reasons would
show that though the domestic violence against women was  
addressed to some extent by the penal law under <a href="/doc/542601/" id="a_11">Section 
498A</a>, the same was not addressed by the civil law it was felt.
Hence, Protection of Women from <a href="/doc/542601/" id="a_12">Domestic Violence Act</a> was   
brought into force w.e.f. 26.10.2006. The reliefs sought to be
provided under this enactment, as we will presently see are
therefore predominantly civil in nature in tune with the
object of the Act. In the line, <a href="/doc/1860699/" id="a_13">Section 18</a> provides Protection
order against domestic violence; <a href="/doc/1130386/" id="a_14">Section 19</a> intended to grant
Residence order; <a href="/doc/485875/" id="a_15">Section 20</a> confers Monetary reliefs; <a href="/doc/363610/" id="a_16">Section
21</a> grants Custody order relating to the custody of the
children and <a href="/doc/1797053/" id="a_17">Section 22</a> confer compensation and damages to  
the victim of domestic violence. So these remedies are purely
civil in nature and it is important to note none of the several
forms of the domestic violence committed by the respondents
under these sections is referred as an offence and respondents
as offenders.  It is only when an order is passed under any of
the aforesaid sections and the breach of protection order is
caused by them, such breach will be termed as an offence
under <a href="/doc/876400/" id="a_18">Section 31</a> of the D.V. Act and the same is categorized
as cognizable and non-bailable under <a href="/doc/1741014/" id="a_19">Section 32</a> of the D.V.
Act.  That is what held in Velisetti Chandra Rekhas case
(1 supra). In the subsequent judgments also similar view was
expressed as below: 
</p>
<p id="p_10">i)      <a href="/doc/115577555/" id="a_20">In Gundu Chandrasekhar vs. The State of 
Andhra Pradesh</a> [5], a learned judge of this High Court
observed thus:
</p><p id="p_11">None of the reliefs claimed in D.V.C. No.8 of 2011 by
the 2nd respondent can be called crimes. Though, the
Act empowers a Magistrate to entertain the complaint
of an aggrieved person under <a href="/doc/1373165/" id="a_21">Section 12</a> of the Act and
makes it incumbent on the Magistrate to make enquiry 
of the same under<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_22"> the Code</a> of Criminal Procedure,
1973, reliefs under <a href="/doc/1860699/" id="a_23">Sections 18</a> to <a href="/doc/1797053/" id="a_24">22</a> of the Act are in
the nature of civil reliefs only. It is only violation of
order of the Magistrate which becomes an offence under
<a href="/doc/876400/" id="a_25">Section 31</a> of the Act and which attracts penalty for
breach of protection order by any of the respondents.
Similarly <a href="/doc/765727/" id="a_26">Section 33</a> of the Act provides for penalty for
discharging duty by Protection Officer. Except under
<a href="/doc/876400/" id="a_27">Sections 31</a> and <a href="/doc/765727/" id="a_28">33</a> of the Act which occur in Chapter
V, all the reliefs claimed under Chapter IV of the Act
are not offences and enquiry of rights of the aggrieved
person under <a href="/doc/1860699/" id="a_29">Sections 18</a> to <a href="/doc/1797053/" id="a_30">22</a> of the Act cannot be
termed as trial of a criminal case. (Emphasis supplied)
</p><p id="p_12"> ii)    <a href="/doc/42441439/" id="a_31">In Mohit Yadam and another vs. State of
Andhra Pradesh</a> [6], a learned judge of this High Court
observed thus:
</p>
<p id="p_13">Para 22: If a statute does not provide an offender
liable to any penalty (conviction or sentence) in favour
of the state, it can be said that legislation will be
classified as remedial statute. Remedial statutes are
known as welfare, beneficent or social justice oriented
legislations. A remedial statute receives a liberal
construction. In case of remedial statutes, doubt is
resolved in favour of the class of persons for whose
benefit the statute is enacted. Whenever a legislation
prescribes a duty or penalty for breach of it, it must be
understood that the duty is prescribed in the interest of
the community or some part of it and the penalties
prescribed as a sanction for its purpose. None of the
provisions of the <a href="/doc/542601/" id="a_32">Domestic Violence Act</a>, 2005 has
direct penal consequences. (Emphasis supplied) 

Para 23: Under <a href="/doc/876400/" id="a_33">Section 31</a> of the Domestic Violence
Act, 2005, breach of protection order, or of an interim
protection order, by the Respondent shall be an offence
under the Act. Therefore, all other orders passed under
<a href="/doc/615600/" id="a_34">Sections 17</a>,<a href="/doc/1860699/" id="a_35">18</a>,<a href="/doc/1130386/" id="a_36">19</a>,<a href="/doc/485875/" id="a_37">20</a> and <a href="/doc/1797053/" id="a_38">22</a> of the Domestic Violence 
Act, 2005 have no penal consequences, even if the
Respondent committed breach of the order, except as 
provided under <a href="/doc/876400/" id="a_39">Section 31</a> of the Act. (Emphasis
supplied)

Therefore, it is clear that the proceedings conducted till
passing of the orders under <a href="/doc/1860699/" id="a_40">Section 18</a> to <a href="/doc/1797053/" id="a_41">22</a> are only civil in
nature to provide a civil remedy. Thus it is a civil comfit
packed with a criminal wrapper.
</p>        
<p id="p_14">6.      On consideration of the rival submissions and in the
light of the judgment stated supra, it is pertinent to see
whether the allegations made in the complaint prima facie
constitute any offence.
</p>
<p id="p_15">7.      In the light of the judgment of the Honble Supreme
Court in C.B.I. V/s. A. RAVI SHANKER PRASAD , certain   
guidelines rendered in STATE OF HARYANA V/S.    
BHAJANLAL  case have been referred. The scope of <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_42">Section  
482</a> Cr.P.C is limited and this Court can exercise its
inherent jurisdiction only to give effect to the orders passed
under<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_43"> the Code</a>, to prevent abuse of process of the Court
and to secure the ends of justice.  Keeping in mind, the
Apex Court in BHAJANLAL laid down the following seven  
guidelines, which are as follows :
</p><p id="p_16">(1) Where the allegations made in the first information report or the
complaint, even if they are taken at their face value and accepted in
their entirety do not prima facie constitute any offence or make out a
case against the accused. 
</p>
<p id="p_17">(2) Where the allegations in the first information report and other
materials, if any, accompanying the FIR do not disclose a cognizable
offence, justifying an investigation by police officers under <a href="/doc/51689/" id="a_44">Section
156(1)</a> of the Code except under an order of a Magistrate within the
purview of <a href="/doc/1518148/" id="a_45">Section 155(2)</a> of the Code.
</p>
<p id="p_18">(3) Where the allegations made in the FIR or complaint and the
evidence collected in support of the same do not disclose the
commission of any offence and make out a case against the accused.  
</p>
<p id="p_19"> (4) Where, the allegations in the FIR do not constitute a cognizable
offence but constitute only a non- cognizable offence, no investigation
is permitted by a police officer without an order of a Magistrate as
contemplated under <a href="/doc/1518148/" id="a_46">Section 155(2)</a> of the Code.
</p>
<p id="p_20">(5) Where the allegations made in the FIR or complaint are so absurd
and inherently improbable on the basis of which no prudent person
can ever reach a just conclusion that there is sufficient ground for
proceeding against the accused.
</p>
<p id="p_21">(6) Where there is an express legal bar engrafted in any of the
provisions<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_47"> of the Code</a> or the concerned Act (under which a criminal
proceeding is instituted) to the institution and continuance of the
proceedings and/or where there is a specific provision in<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_48"> the Code</a> or
the concerned Act, providing efficacious redress for the grievance of
the aggrieved party.
</p>
<p id="p_22">(7) Where a criminal proceeding is manifestly attended with mala fide
and/or where the proceeding is maliciously instituted with an ulterior
motive for wreaking vengeance on the accused and with a view to spite
him due to private and personal grudge."
</p>
<p id="p_23">8.      As per guidelines 2 and 3, when the allegations made
in FIR or complaint if taken on its face value would not
prima facie constitute commission of any offence, the Court
can exercise its inherent power under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_49">Section 482</a> Cr.P.C. to
quash the proceedings.  Similarly, if the allegations made in
the complaint are improper to the ordinary circumstances
of a common man, the Court may exercise its inherent 
jurisdiction and quash the proceedings.
</p>
<p id="p_24">9.      It is to be seen even if the averments taken at their
face value are accepted in their entirety, they do not prima
facie constitute offence or make out a case against the
accused, in such cases the accused is entitled for quashing
of the proceedings.
</p>
<p id="p_25">10.     As far as the present case is concerned, there are
allegations against the petitioners.  It is alleged that at the
time of marriage the parents of the defacto complainant
presented cash and gold articles and household articles to
her husband, but her husband and the petitioners herein
have harassed her physically and mentally for additional
dowry and her husband used to come in drunken condition 
and beat her.  The truth of the allegations can be verified
only at the time of trial.
</p>
<p id="p_26">11.     In the light of the decisions referred above and in
view of the submissions made by the learned counsel for
the petitioners, this Court is of the considered view that it
is not a fit case for quashing the proceedings against the
petitioners.  The petitioners may approach the trial court
and seek appropriate remedies available under <a href="/doc/542601/" id="a_50">Domestic
Violence Act</a>. The petitioners have already been granted
interim stay and it is appropriate to dispense with their
presence during the trial. Therefore, the presence of the
petitioners is dispensed during the trial and except on the
occasions insisted by the trial court.
</p>
<p id="p_27">12.     With the above observations, this Criminal Petition is
disposed of accordingly.  Miscellaneous petitions, if any,
pending in this Criminal Petition stands closed.
