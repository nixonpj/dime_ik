</pre>
<p id="p_1">       This suit is filed by plaintiff for specific performance

directing the defendant to execute the absolute sale deed

in respect of the schedule property as per agreement of

sale    dated    18.01.2012   by     receiving    balance       sale

consideration of Rs.29,50,000/- and to get the same

registered at the cost of plaintiff and on the failure, to

execute the sale deed in favour of plaintiff through Court.

By amending the plaint, plaintiff has prayed for an

alternative relief in lieu of specific performance by way of

refund of advance amount of Rs.42,50,000/- with interest

at 18% p.a. from the date of agreement till realization or to

award    a sum of Rs.42,50,000/- as damages by way of

compensation which is equal to the advance amount.


</p><p id="p_2">       2. The case of the plaintiff in brief is that, defendant

is the absolute owner of the suit property bearing site
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                3             O.S.No.863/2013</span>



No.80, khata No.287/393 which is described in the plaint

schedule. The defendant had offered to sell the suit

property to the plaintiff at Rs.72.00 lakhs and on

18.1.2012, agreement was entered into between the

plaintiff and defendant. Out of total consideration amount,

Rs.42,50,000/- is paid as advance by two cheques for

Rs.12,50,000/- and Rs.30,00,000/-. In the agreement,

flow of title to the property has been stated. The defendant

had informed the plaintiff that he had mortgaged the

property in favour of Canara Bank, Majestic Branch,

Bangalore.   To discharge the mortgage amount and also

for his legal and family necessities, he had offered to sell

the suit property in favour of plaintiff. It was mutually

agreed between the parties that the defendant would

execute the absolute sale deed in favour of the plaintiff

within 30 days from the date of agreement of sale and

defendant has also agreed to furnish all the title deeds of

the schedule property. The defendant has also promised to

get certified copies of the title deeds pertaining to schedule

property and agreed to furnish the original registered sale
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                   4                O.S.No.863/2013</span>



deed which is mortgaged to the Bank at the time of

registration of the sale deed. The defendant and his wife

have   represented       that   the    original    title   document

pertaining to the property has been lost and in that

regard, a public notice was also issued in Udayavani and

The Hindu, news papers. The plaintiff has been ready and

willing to perform his part of contract as per the terms of

the agreement of sale. Subsequent to the execution of the

agreement of sale, it was brought to the notice of the

plaintiff that M/s.Venkatalakshmamma Subbaiah Setty

Education and Charitable Trust, represented by its

Trustees     -      defendant         Jagannatha         Setty   and

Smt.Yashodamma, have filed S.A.No.314/2012 before

Debts Recovery Tribunal seeking setting aside the sale

notice dated 31.03.2012 issued by Canara Bank. Hon'ble

Debt Recovery Tribunal has deferred the sale of the

schedule property subject to payment of Rs.20.00 lakhs

and defendant was given opportunity to settle the loan

account    within    3    months.      The   plaintiff     has   been

repeatedly demanding and requesting the defendant to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                    5              O.S.No.863/2013</span>



comply as per the terms of the agreement of sale i.e. to get

the original documents released from Canara Bank and to

execute the sale deed in favour of plaintiff.               As the

defendant has not come forward to execute the sale deed,

legal notice was issued on 31.12.2012. In spite of that,

defendant has not come forward to execute the sale deed.

In spite of giving sufficient opportunity to the defendant to

deposit the balance loan amount, he has failed to do so,

and Hon'ble Debt Recovery Tribunal has confirmed the

sale on 30.07.2013 and the schedule property has been

auctioned and then, the property of his wife Yashodamma

is also auctioned which is subject matter of another suit

in O.S.No.861/2013. The defendant, in spite of receiving

substantial    amount       towards    sale   consideration    has

committed breach of agreement and in lieu of specific

performance,    plaintiff    prayed    for    refund   of   amount

together with interest by amending the plaint.

</p><p id="p_3">     3. The defendant filed written statement and stated

that the suit is filed without any foundation and reliefs

prayed   by plaintiff       are   mutually    contradictory.   The
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                         6                O.S.No.863/2013</span>



plaintiff can only seek specific performance and cannot

seek contradictory relief as stated in the plaint. It is stated

that it was well within the knowledge of the plaintiff that

at the time of execution of agreement of sale, schedule

property was mortgaged to Canara Bank and Canara

Bank asserted its right over the mortgaged schedule

property and it was incumbent on the part of the plaintiff

to have protected her rights by invoking the provisions of

Securitization Act by filing necessary application before

Debt Recovery Tribunal, Bangalore. It is stated that the

plaintiff   has    failed    to   so.       When   the    provisions   of

Securitization Act is invoked, the jurisdiction of the civil

Courts is barred. Therefore, suit is to be dismissed for lack

of jurisdiction. The defendant has also stated that plaintiff

is employing strong arm methods for recovery of the

amount      paid    by      her   which       resulted     in   criminal

proceedings. It is stated that specific performance has

become infructuous in view of the steps initiated by

Canara Bank. The defendant has stated that the plaintiff

has suppressed information regarding refund received
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                7           O.S.No.863/2013</span>



from defendant in respect of which the defendant reserves

the right to produce necessary evidence. As per the

agreement, plaintiff is precluded from claiming refund of

any amount. On these grounds, suit is prayed to be

dismissed with cost.

          contract before the suit schedule
          property was sold in public auction by
          Canara Bank?

      Issue Nos.1 &amp; 2: In the Affirmative
      Issue No.3:        Plaintiff is entitled for refund of

sell the suit property to the plaintiff for Rs.72.00 lakhs

part of contract. The property has been subsequently sold

by Canara Bank for its dues. Since property has been sold

by Canara Bank for its dues, the plaintiff has also prayed

for alternative relief of refund of advance amount with

interest at the rate of 18% p.a. or in the alternative for

return of the advance amount with damages which is

equal to the advance amount. The defendant in the

written statement has not disputed the agreement of sale.

The defendant has stated that plaintiff was aware of the

proceedings before Debt Recovery Tribunal and has not

taken steps to seek necessary reliefs in the Debt Recovery

Tribunal proceedings under the Securitization Act.


</p><p id="p_16">      9.    For   the   plaintiff,       K.Krishnappa,    S/o.   late

Kenchappa has given evidence as P.W.1 as SPA holder

and   has     stated    plaint   averments.       In     his   cross-

examination, witness has stated that as on the date of

agreement, plaintiff was aware that the property was

mortgaged in Canara Bank and has stated that he was

aware that original title document is to be given to the

Bank for mortgage. Witness has stated that defendant had
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                 10            O.S.No.863/2013</span>



taken amount for clearing Bank loan and had agreed to

execute the sale deed after clearing loan of Canara Bank.

Witness has admitted that defendant had filed petition

before Debt Recovery Tribunal and even plaintiff had filed

application to implead him as party in the said petition

and the said application is dismissed. Witness has stated

that he do not know how much amount the defendant has

paid to Canara Bank. Witness has admitted that Debt

Recovery   Tribunal      has   dismissed   petition   filed   by

petitioner. PW1 has denied that though the defendant has

repaid the amount taken in Ex.P-1 to the plaintiff, plaintiff

has not given receipt.

stated about agreement of sale entered between plaintiff

and defendant. In the cross-examination, he has stated

that as per the agreement, plaintiff was required to pay

Rs.72.00 lakhs and plaintiff has paid Rs.42,50,000/- by

two cheques. Witness has stated that Ex.P-1 is not

registered and denied that he is not aware of the

transaction between parties.

</p><p id="p_20">     11. The plaintiff has produced agreement of sale as

Ex.P-1. Though there was deficit stamp duty, said deficit

has been paid by plaintiff. Copy of the notice issued to the

defendant, postal receipt, postal acknowledgement are

produced as Ex.P-2 to P-4. Paper publications given

regarding loss of documents are produced as Ex.P-5 and

P-6. Statement of account of the plaintiff's Bank account

is produced as Ex.P-7. Notice sent by plaintiff to Canara

Bank is produced as Ex.P-8. P-9 and P-11 are Order sheet

has stated his contentions taken in the written statement.

Witness has also stated that as per clause-3 of the

agreement, plaintiff was required to pay additional sale

consideration amount of Rs.5.0 lakhs and the said

amount has not been paid and plaintiff has committed

breach of terms of agreement and plaintiff has not called

upon the defendant to execute sale deed on or before 30

days from the date of agreement. Witness has also stated

that as per clause-5 of the agreement, failure on the part

of the plaintiff to call upon the vendor to execute the sale

deed within the period results in automatic cancellation of

the agreement. Therefore, plaintiff is not entitled for other

reliefs. Witness has stated that he has not committed any

breach of terms of agreement and has also stated that he

has paid Rs.45.00 lakhs to the Canara Bank and as the

property is already auctioned by Canara Bank, suit has

become infructuous. In the cross-examination, witness

has admitted the execution of agreement of sale and also

payment of advance consideration amount. However,

witness has denied that balance amount was agreed to be

paid at the time of registration. Witness has admitted that

himself and his wife are Trustees of M/s.Venkata-

lakshmamma Subbaiah Setty Education and Charitable

Trust and for the said Trust, loan of Rs.65.00 lakhs was

obtained. Witness has stated that they have paid Rs.20.00

lakhs to the Bank out of the receipt of advance

consideration amount. Witness has admitted that he has

filed   the   case    before   Debt      Recovery    Tribunal   for

cancellation of sale notice and Debt Recovery Tribunal has

imposed certain conditions for payment of amount and

entire amount was not paid by him and as the amount

was not paid, Bank has sold the property and after sale of

the property, there is still balance. Witness has admitted

that he has preferred appeal against order and matter has

been stayed. Witness has admitted that he has not given

reply to the notice given by plaintiff. Witness has denied

that plaintiff is entitled for 18% interest on the advanced

amount and she is entitled for refund of the amount.


</p><p id="p_23">        13.   On     looking   to    pleadings,     evidence    and

documents, defendant's ownership of the suit property is

not in dispute. It is also not in dispute that the defendant

had agreed to sell the suit property to the plaintiff for

Rs.72.00 lakhs and has received Rs.42,50,000/- as

advance consideration amount and executed agreement of

sale as per Ex.P-1. Conditions in the agreement of sale are

also not in dispute. As per the agreement, sale deed is to

be executed within 30 days from the date of agreement i.e.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                               14            O.S.No.863/2013</span>



18.01.2012. It is mentioned in the agreement that Rs.5.0

lakhs additional advance consideration amount is to be

paid within 10 days and the defendant has to issue

acknowledgement for having received the advance sale

consideration amount. This additional sale consideration

is admittedly not paid by plaintiff. Plaintiff has stated in

the plaint and in evidence that this amount was over and

above advance consideration amount and it was to be paid

to get the original documents from Bank. The defendant

though in his evidence as D.W.1 has stated that plaintiff

has not complied with the requirement of payment of

additional consideration amount of Rs.5.0 lakhs and has

violated condition of the agreement, such contention is not

taken by defendant in the written statement.      Therefore

nothing much could be considered in respect of this

payment or non-payment of Rs.5.0 lakhs as additional

consideration amount as mentioned in Ex.P-1 agreement.

Both parties have not disputed the agreement at Ex.P-1.

The plaintiff has stated in the plaint that after entering

into agreement of sale, she came to know that there is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                                15             O.S.No.863/2013</span>



mortgage    created   by   defendant   with   Canara   Bank.

However, in Ex.P-1 agreement itself at page No.3, it has

been mentioned that defendant has pledged the schedule

property at Canara Bank, Majestic Branch and is desirous

of conveying the same after discharge of the said

mortgage.    Therefore, existence of the mortgage with

Canara Bank in respect of this property was even

mentioned in Ex.P-1 agreement. With the understanding

that after discharging the mortgage loan property will be

conveyed, parties appear to have entered into agreement

of sale. Unfortunately, mortgage is not cleared and the

Bank has taken steps for recovery of the amount by sale of

the mortgaged property. Copy of the Debt Recovery

Tribunal proceedings show that the defendant and his wife

have approached Debt Recovery Tribunal and Order is

passed on 10.04.2013 and Bank was allowed to go ahead

with the proposed sale of the property but the appellants

i.e. defendant was directed to deposit Rs.5.0 lakhs to the

loan account in question with the Respondent Bank prior

to the sale and deposit sum of Rs.5.0 lakhs on or before
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">                              16            O.S.No.863/2013</span>



18.04.2013 and also shall deposit Rs.60.00 lakhs within

two months and with this condition, confirmation of the

sale was deferred. The admitted facts show that defendant

could not pay the amount and has not complied with the

directions of payment made by Debt Recovery Tribunal

and as admitted by D.W.1, property has been auctioned

and the purchaser has even constructed a building in the

property.    Evidence of P.W.1 and D.W.1 also show that

even the plaintiff had filed application before Debt

Recovery Tribunal, however, said application has been

dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_24">
</p><p id="p_25">     14.     As per Ex.P-1 agreement, defendant has to

execute sale deed in favour of plaintiff after discharging

mortgage of the Canara Bank by receiving balance

consideration amount. It is stated by defendant that he

has paid Rs.45.00 lakhs to the Bank, but he could not pay

entire amount in time and it is admitted that Bank has

already auctioned the property. Since the mortgaged

property is already auctioned for the loan of defendant

and his wife as Trustees of the Trust, the suit property is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                               17            O.S.No.863/2013</span>



not available for conveying to the plaintiff as per Ex.P-1.

Both plaintiff and defendant were aware of the mortgage

existing in favour of Canara Bank on this property. Even

after having knowledge of the said mortgage, plaintiff had

agreed to purchase the property on the hope that the

defendant will clear the mortgage and convey the property

to the plaintiff.   As property is already sold by Canara

Bank for its dues and the purchaser is in possession of

the property as admitted by parties, specific performance

has become impossible. The defendant had opportunity to

clear the mortgage by making due payment to the Bank

even after order of Debt Recovery Tribunal. As the

defendant has not made the payment, property has been

auctioned and purchaser has come in possession and the

agreement became impossible for specific performance.

The plaintiff has stated in the plaint that she was always

ready and willing to perform her part of contract. Plaintiff

has produced bank statement showing that she was

having considerable amount in her Bank account at the

relevant period. Moreover, considerable amount has been
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">                                18              O.S.No.863/2013</span>



paid as advance and out of total consideration amount of

Rs.72.00 lakhs, Rs.42,50,000/- has already been paid at

the time of agreement. There is nothing before the Court

to disprove the readiness and willingness of the plaintiff to

perform her part of contract. Though in the written

statement, defendant has stated that plaintiff has failed to

protect   her   rights   by   invoking   the    provisions   of

Securitization Act by filing necessary application before

Debt Recovery Tribunal, it is suggested in the cross

examination of P.W.1 that, in the appeal filed by

defendant, plaintiff had filed application to implead her as

party and said application is dismissed. Therefore, it is

clear that even plaintiff made efforts to participate in

proceedings before DRT.        However, fact remains that

specific performance cannot be granted on this agreement,

as property is already sold by auction for the dues of the

Canara Bank and is not available for sale. Therefore,

plaintiff has proved agreement of sale between parties and

also payment of advance consideration amount. Plaintiff

has also proved that she was always ready and willing to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">                               19            O.S.No.863/2013</span>



perform her part of contract. Still, as property is already

sold in public auction of their dues of Canara Bank,

specific performance cannot be ordered in this suit.


</p><p id="p_26">     15. Though the plaintiff has prayed for specific

performance initially, subsequently by amending the

plaint, plaintiff has sought for relief of return of advance

consideration amount with interest at 18% p.a. or equal

amount of advance consideration amount as damages.

Since the defendant had received considerable advance

consideration amount of Rs.42,50,000/- by agreeing to

sell the property and there is no fault on the part of

plaintiff in non-performance of contract as the property is

auctioned for the dues of the defendant in Canara Bank

and the specific performance has become impossible,

plaintiff would be entitled for refund of the advance

consideration amount.
</p>
<p id="p_27">
</p><p id="p_28">     16. The plaintiff has asked for interest @ 18% p.a.

from the date of agreement till realization. The plaintiff

has alternatively prayed to award Rs.42,50,000/- as

damages by way of compensation. The learned counsel for
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">                                 20              O.S.No.863/2013</span>



defendant vehemently argued that the plaintiff is not

entitled for interest as prayed. In this connection, he has

stated that the agreement Ex.P-1 does not provide for

payment of interest by the vendor to the purchaser in case

of failure to execute the sale deed. On the contrary,

learned counsel for plaintiff argued that as per agreement

Ex.P-1, if the agreement is terminated on the ground that

some representations of the vendor are untrue, then the

vendor is liable to refund the advance consideration

amount and to pay additional amount of Rs.2.0 lakhs on

termination of agreement. It is stated that it is not

termination     of   agreement,      it   is   impossibility   of

performance of contract.      On looking to the facts of the

case, plaintiff is entitled for interest as she has paid

considerable amount in 2012 and defendant has not

returned the amount even after four years and for no fault

of plaintiff, she has suffered loss.

<p id="p_29">

prayed by plaintiff, serious dispute has been raised by

defendant,    The counsel for defendant has relied on a
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">                               21            O.S.No.863/2013</span>



decision reported in AIR 1966 SC 395 (<a href="/doc/300557/" id="a_1">The Union of

India v. The West Punjab Factories Limited</a>) in which

on different facts, Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that In

the absence of any usage or contract, express or implied, or

of any provision of law to justify the award of interest,

interest by way of damages cannot be awarded. No interest

could thus be awarded for the period upto the date of the

suit. On going through the facts of the case, decision is on

different facts in which, suit was for damages to goods by

fire on the railway platform. No money was passed from

one party to another and the suit was for damages. In

such suit, by considering facts of the case, Hon'ble

Supreme Court has held that no interest can be awarded

by way of damages. In para No.16, it is observed that The

next contention is that no interest could be awarded for the

period before the suit on the amount of damages decreed.

In the present suit, it is for return of the advance amount

which is actually parted by plaintiff to the defendant. For

no fault of plaintiff, she has not received property and has

parted with money which is a considerable amount of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">                               22               O.S.No.863/2013</span>



Rs.42,50,000/-. Therefore, plaintiff is entitled for interest

on the said amount.

<p id="p_31">
</p><p id="p_32">     18. In another decision reported in AIR 1988

Madras    167   (<a href="/doc/271955/" id="a_2">T.K.Sundaram      vs.   The    Co-operative

Sugars Limited, Chittoor</a>), it is held that In a suit for

compensation for breach of contract and no interest

provided for in agreement, then the interest could not be

awarded from date of suit till date of decree and the

interest could be awarded only from date of decree till date

of payment.
</p>
<p id="p_33">
</p><p id="p_34">     19. In the agreement Ex.P-1, no doubt, there is no

mentioning about interest payable for the advance amount

in case of impossibility or failure to execute the sale deed.

At the same time, it is nowhere mentioned in the

agreement that no interest is payable by the vendor in

case of his failure to execute the sale deed. Therefore,

Ex.P-1 agreement is silent with regard to interest. When a

person has parted with money with an intention to

purchase the property and the property could not be

purchased by him due to impossibility, then naturally,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">                                23             O.S.No.863/2013</span>



person who has paid the amount is entitled for return of

the amount with considerable interest. It was the lookout

of the defendant to clear the loan obtained by mortgaging

the property from Canara Bank. Due to the fault of the

defendant in non- repayment of the loan, property is

brought for auction. Even if the defendant had paid the

entire advance consideration amount received by him for

the loan, substantial amount in the loan would have been

discharged. Therefore, due to the fault of the defendant,

contract has become impossible and therefore, plaintiff is

justified in seeking interest. Though Plaintiff has prayed

for interest @ 18% p.a, by considering interest prevailing

in the business, it is proper to award interest @ 12% p.a.

from the date of agreement till filing of the suit. Even from

the date of suit till realization of the entire amount,

plaintiff is entitled for interest @ 12% p.a. Accordingly,

issue Nos.1 and 2 are answered in the Affirmative and

Issue No.3 is answered partly in the affirmative.

Nos.1 to 3, plaintiff is not entitled for specific performance.

The plaintiff is entitled for alternative relief of refund of

earnest money with interest @ 12% p.a. from the date of
