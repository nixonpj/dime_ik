PIL No. 12/2013, IA Nos. 1/2017 &amp; 253/2014.

                                                             Date of Order: 14.08.2018.
                Viklang Chhatra Trust through Satya Pal Saraf
                                     Vs
                          State of J&amp;K and another
Coram:
            Hon'ble Mr. Justice Dhiraj Singh Thakur, Judge
            Hon'ble Mr. Justice Sanjay Kumar Gupta, Judge
Appearance:
For the appellant(s)/petitioner (s)   :   Mr. Sunil Sethi, Sr. Advocate with
                                          Mr. Parimoksh Seth, Advocate.
For the respondent(s)                 :   Mr. Sudesh Magotra, GA.</pre>


<p id="p_1">01.    The present petition is filed in public interest inter alia with a
view to highlight the issues relating to the pension payable to the old
and the aged, to widows and physically handicapped persons etc.
Both the State Government as also the Central Government have
framed schemes for the benefit of the persons falling in the
aforementioned categories.
</p>
<p id="p_2">02.    In terms of direction dated 31.03.2018, the Director, Social
Welfare Department has filed the compliance report, wherein the
details of the approved beneficiaries under the Integrated Social
Security Scheme were given for various categories. After approval,
the approved cases have to be considered by the Government for
grant of formal sanction. It is stated that only after the grant of formal
sanction, the beneficiaries, whose cases have been approved will start


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">PIL No. 12/2013 along with connected IAs                                       Page 1 of 3</span>
 getting pensions under various schemes. Status report on behalf of the
Director, Social Welfare Department is proposed to be filed today.
</p>
<p id="p_3">03.     In pursuance of the order dated 03.07.2018, a stand has been
taken that the Directorate of Social Welfare has since forwarded the
cases for grant of formal sanction and in that regard various
communications have been addressed to the Commissioner Secretary
to Government, Social Welfare Department. The status report further
reflects that a formal decision has to be taken by the State
Administrative Council (SAC), which proposes to grant the
assistance to all eligible pending cases during the current financial
year.
</p>
<p id="p_4">04.     From the report, it transpires that almost one lakh beneficiaries
are awaiting the decision of the Government with regard to grant of
financial sanction. Considering the fact that the cases pertain to a
section of society, which is incapable of supporting itself and
considering the fact that the Government has framed the schemes for
their welfare and for ameliorating their living standards, the issue
deserves to be taken up by the Government at the earliest.
</p>
<p id="p_5">05.     We, accordingly, deem it appropriate to direct the Chief
Secretary to file an affidavit within four weeks for bringing on record
the steps taken with regard to the grant of formal sanction in regard to
the case of such beneficiaries, whose cases have been approved by
the Directorate of Social Welfare and are pending grant of formal
sanction by the Government. The Chief Secretary will also take such


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">PIL No. 12/2013 along with connected IAs                        Page 2 of 3</span>
 steps as are necessary to ensure that the funds, which are otherwise to
be received from the Central Government are also received and
released in regard to such schemes, as have been supported by the
Central Government under NSAP Scheme in this regard.
</p>
<p id="p_6">06.     We are also informed that the pace of work with regard to the
construction of Old Age Home and Children Home is also moving at
a very slow pace. The Chief Secretary, J&amp;K shall also state as to what
steps have been taken by the Government to ensure speedy
implementation of the projects with regard to the above.
</p>
<p id="p_7">07.    Post on 19.09.2018.
</p>
<p id="p_8">08.    Copy of this order be provided to the learned counsel for the
parties, under the seal and signatures of the Bench Secretary of this
Court for compliance.
