                  W.P.(C) No.20231 of 2016
          -----------------------------------------------
          Dated this the 13th day of February, 2017


                            JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">      This writ petition is filed by the petitioner seeking

direction to the respondents to permit the petitioner to take

delivery of diesel from the respondent's filling station in tanker

lorry bearing No.KL-25A/7548 on the date of placing order

itself, and for other related reliefs.
</p>
<p id="p_2">      2.    Petitioner is a grantee of a consumer pump allotted

by the 1st respondent. Petitioner requires substantial quantity

of diesel on a regular basis for conducting its industrial unit. It

was in such circumstances, petitioner applied for a consumer

pump, with a view that its industrial unit may not suffer for

want of diesel. The respondent used to deliver diesel on the

day of placement of order itself.              However, recently,

respondent is denying delivery on the premise that the

transportation can be arranged only in terms of the tanker

lorries. In view of the delay, petitioner had to suffer in terms

of time and scarcity of diesel and also in terms of price.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">W.P.(C) No.20231 of 2016          2</span>

</p><p id="p_3">      3.   One of the directors of the petitioner company is a

grantee of MS/HSD dealership viz., M/s. Mallelil Fuels, and the

same is situated in the nearby town.          The said dealer has

tanker lorries registered with the respondent company.

Petitioner requires only 3 tanker loads of diesel in a month.

Earlier, the respondent used to permit the petitioner to take

delivery of diesel in one of the registered tanker lorries of the

above referred M/s. Mallelil Fuels. In view of the recurring

delay on the part of the respondent in delivering diesel,

petitioner made a request to the respondent to permit them to

take delivery of diesel in one of the registered tanker lorries of

M/s. Mallelil Fuels or else to supply/deliver diesel on the date

of placement order.        It is in this background, seeking

appropriate direction, this writ petition is filed.

</p><p id="p_4">      4.   Respondents have filed a joint statement refuting

the allegations and claims and demands raised by the

petitioner and among other contentions, it is stated that,

petitioner is a quarry operator and in order to augment its

needs, a consumer pump facility was awarded to the petitioner

in the year 2004, for the exclusive purpose of fuelling the

vehicles/equipments used for the petitioner's           quarrying

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">W.P.(C) No.20231 of 2016         3</span>

operation. In terms of the consumer pump agreement, supply

of fuel to the consumer pump and manner of such supply is

the sole responsibility of BPCL.         The capacity of the

underground tank provided to the petitioner is 20 kilo litres

(KL)   A truck load is 12 KL and the petitioner has, on an

average, placing indents for about 3 loads in a month.

Therefore, it would seem that the average consumption of the

petitioner is only around 1.4 KL per day.
</p>
<p id="p_5">      5.    In order to transport fuel to the retail outlets and

consumer pumps, BPCL enters into transportation contracts

with respect to identified trucks, pursuant to a comprehensive

tender process. Prior to floating of the transportation tenders,

BPCL invites Expressions of Interest from retail outlet dealers,

and consumer pump operators for offering their own trucks for

the purpose of obtaining their own supplies.        M/s. Mallelil

Fuels, a sister concern of the petitioner, submitted such an

expression of interest and obtained a work order for truck KL-

25 A/7548, evident from Annexure-R1(a).        It is also stated

that, petitioner did not submit any expression of interest and

did   not   obtain   any  work   order   during   the   previous

transportation contract period. While the work order was in

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">W.P.(C) No.20231 of 2016         4</span>

force, petitioner as per letter dated 24.09.2014 requested the

respondents to effect supplies through the tank truck of Mallelil

Fuels, evident from Annexure-R1(c).         It was rejected by

Annexure-R1(d).       In spite thereof, for the subsequent

transport contract period, petitioner opted not to submit any

expression of interest or obtain any work order for taking its

own loads.
</p>
<p id="p_6">      6.    According to the respondents, petitioner cannot

insist the respondents to send the truck loads in a particular

vehicle, since the petitioner is not entitled as of right to insist

the company for doing such an act. The same is not a vehicle

owned by the petitioner and therefore, the insistence made by

the petitioner in that regard is not liable to be obliged by the

respondents. It is also stated that a standing procedure for

supply is adopted, and it is in accordance with the procedures

alone, the truck loads are sent as per the request made by the

petitioner. It is further stated, since the tank has a capacity

of 20 KL and the petitioner is having consumption of 1.4 KL

per day, petitioner can adjust the supply to be made by the

respondents sufficiently early. Therefore, the petitioner need

not wait till the underground tank gets emptied. There is usual

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">W.P.(C) No.20231 of 2016           5</span>

procedural delay and there is no willful laches or deliberate

action on the part of the respondents in not sending fuel to the

petitioner in accordance with the indents submitted by the

petitioner.  Therefore, it is submitted that the contentions

advanced cannot be sustained under law and on facts.

</p><p id="p_7">      7.   A reply affidavit is filed by the petitioner reiterating

the stand adopted in the writ petition.
</p>
<p id="p_8">      8.   Having heard learned counsel for the petitioner and

the learned counsel appearing for the respondents, and

perusing the pleadings and the documents on record, I am of

the considered opinion that as per the terms of the guidelines

issued by the company, petitioner cannot insist that the truck

load should be sent on a particular vehicle, unless and until

petitioner is having its own vehicle to supply fuel to its own

consumer pump. The vehicle offered by the petitioner during

the course of contract period is one belonging to the sister

concern of the petitioner, which cannot be accepted by the

respondent company, in terms of the existing rules. It is also

stated that there is no delay on the part of the respondents in

sending the truck loads when indents are placed by the

petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_9"><span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">W.P.(C) No.20231 of 2016         6</span>

</p><p id="p_10">      9.    Anyhow, taking note of the respective submissions,

I am of the considered opinion that petitioner is not entitled to

insist the respondents to send the load in a particular vehicle.

It is for the company to decide in accordance with the turn of

the vehicles for supplying the load also in accordance with the

indent submitted by the petitioner.        I am also of the

considered opinion that, apart from the usual procedural delay,

no delay is deliberately caused by the respondent company, for

sending the truck load as and when indent is submitted by the

petitioner. Petitioner also could not establish by any cogent

evidence and reasonable proof that such a deliberate action is

taken by the respondents.
</p>
<p id="p_11">      10. In that view of the matter, I think the writ petition

can be disposed of holding that there is no deliberate attempt

on the part of the respondents in putting the petitioner to any

manner of difficulties. However, the respondents shall make

every endeavour to send the load as and when indent is

submitted by the petitioner, limiting the procedural delay to

the shortest time possible.
