              responsible for surveillance of the premises of the Jail.
              He got information on 5.07.05 at about 1.00 PM that the
              Applicant was to enter into monetary dealings with some
              outsider near gate number 3 of the Jail. He would not

              one was present in his office when this call was received.

              Assistant Superintendents, Vinay Thakur and Praveen
              Sinha. He was not present at the spot, where the alleged

              5.07.2005 given by the As.sistant Superintendents, who
              were responsible officers. He had ascertained from the
              Applicant that the latter commuted every day from
              Gurgaon to Delhi Cantonment Railway Station.

              that he stood by the facts recorded in his report dated
              5.07.2005. We note, however, that this report has not
              been exhibited.     The Applicant would, therefore, be
              unaware of its contents. This contention has been
              seriously raised by the learned counsel in his submission
              on behalf of the Respondent. In fact this point has been
              repeatedly raised by the Applicant in his statement of
              defence before the Enquiry Officer and in his appeal
              against the order of the Disciplinary Authority. He has
              stated that he was present in the office of the Petition

              escaped by pushing one warder and Vinay Thakur , AS
              both of whom were present in the toilet. He and other
              warders were present outside the toilet. He stated that
              the wall jumped over by the Respondent, while escaping
              from the scene of the alleged misconduct was four feet
              high. He did not know the name of the warder who called
              to give this information. Sh. Vinay Thakur, AS on the
              other hand stated that the call was received at 11.30AM.

              Superintendent, P K Sinha and two warders of Petition
              officer's Branch at gate number 3. He did not remember
              the names of the warder. He was positioned at the outer
              entrance gate of the toilet and the incident of giving
              and taking of money and cheques was not visible from
              outside. According to him, the wall over which the
              Applicant jumped was five to six feet high. Only one
              warder of the petition Officer's Branch was present
              inside the toilet. He P. K. Sinha and another warder were
              at the 'out gate' of the toilet. Nobody pushed us. The
              Applicant jumped over the wall on seeing them. It is
              difficult not to notice the subtle and no subtle differences,
              inaccuracies and in congruencies in the statements of the
              witnesses. According to MPS Bali, he was alone in his
              room when the information was received about the
              possibility of the Applicant taking bribe. According to
              both the Assistant Superintendents, they were present in
              MPS Bali's room when the aforementioned information
              was received. According to P. K. Sinha, the other
              Assistant Superintendent Vinay Thakur was present
              inside the toilet at the time of the alleged incident along
              with a warder. However, according to Vinay Thakur, AS,
              he was positioned along with P. K. Sinha at the out gate
              along with two warders. Only one warder was present
              inside the toilet. The number of warders, accompanying
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">W.P.(C) 6990/2009                                                             Page 5 of 18</span>
               them was two according to P. K. Sinha and three as per
              AS Vinay Thakur's version. As per the imputation of
              miss-conduct there was one warder from the Petition
              Officer's Branch. However, these warders - one, two or
              three - are anonymous. They are, if they exist, crucial
              witnesses yet their names are not known to any of the
              three witnesses from the department. One of the
              Assistant      Superintendents says that the Applicant
              pushed the other Assistant Superintendent, Vinay Thakur.
              However, Vinay Thakur denied that he was pushed. In
              the matter of the height of the wall, which the
              Applicant jumped over, there is considerable variation.
              A plan of the site drawn by a certified architect has
              been placed at page 47 of paper book according to
              which the height of the wall varies from eight feet nine
              inches to five feet eight inches. This has also been
              mentioned in paragraphs 4.37 and 5.9 (ii) of the 0.A. and
              not contested the reply affidavit. Only an Olympian
              could jump over this height from a near static

              the Applicant allegedly threw the money, which he had in
              his hands but the amount mentioned in the imputation of
              misconduct totals only to Rs 140/-. The argument is that

       Sh. Praveen Kumar Sinha, Assistant Superintendent dated 5th July, 2005 is a
       listed document as Annexure-II to the chargesheet. Therefore, it cannot be
       contented that it is neither an exhibited document nor the respondent is
       aware of the same. The document was supplied to the Respondent with the
       chargesheet and is exhibited in the Enquiry proceedings. Thereafter, the
       counsel also argued that the Tribunal has failed to appreciate that the

        been pointed out with respect of recovery the question of disbelieving the
       evidence does not arise.
</p><p id="p_6">6.     The counsel for the petitioners further contended that the Tribunal has failed
       to appreciate that even though a call is received at 11:30AM, it is not
       unusual that the culprit was caught at 1:40PM and this fact in any case is not
       denied by the Respondent. In fact, he had admitted that he had gone to the
       toilet at the relevant time which should have been accepted. Furthermore, it
       is well settled law that disciplinary proceedings are not criminal
       proceedings. The standard of proof required is that of pre-ponderance of the
       probability and not proof beyond reasonable doubt vide <a href="/doc/680932/" id="a_3">Union of India v.

       witnesses against the respondent is an eye witness of the incident. The
       warder or warders, who were allegedly inside the toilet watching the money
       changing hands from Manish Singh to the Respondent, have not been
       produced as witnesses. Even their names are not known which would be a
       fatal flaw in conducting the disciplinary proceedings.
</p><p id="p_9">8.     The learned counsel further contends that there have been serious procedural
       irregularities in the enquiry. It is mandatory under Rule 14(18) of the CCS
       (CCA) Rules, 1965 that the Enquiry Officer should examine the charged
       official by informing him about the circumstances appearing against him and
       asking for his explanation. The Enquiry Officer failed to do so. If the

        Enquiry officer failed to so, it would vitiate the enquiry. Rule 14 (18) is
       reproduced below:-

<p id="p_10">9.     The counsel for respondent argued that the Government of NCT of Delhi
       had issued a circular dated 25.11.2005 cautioning the concerned authorities
       to follow the rules strictly. The circular is quoted below:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_13">              "Sub: Conducting of departmental inquiries under the

              proceeded to question him under sub-rule (18) of Rule 14

</blockquote><p id="p_13">11.    The counsel for the respondent argued that the evidence adduced before the
       Enquiry Officer does not link him with the alleged misconduct. Reliance has
       been placed on Sher Bahadur Vs Union of India and others, (2002) 7 SCC

<p id="p_14">12.    To decide the present case in hand we are of the view that it is important to
       discuss the law laid down by the Apex Court in regard to the contention of
       the Counsels that the Tribunal can not look into the evidence adduced in a
       disciplinary enquiry in judicial review. The Hon'ble Apex Court in <a href="/doc/136341809/" id="a_6">Kuldeep

              no evidence, it would be a perverse finding and would be
              amendable to judicial scrutiny.

              between the decisions which are perverse and those

              or evidence which is thoroughly unreliable and no
              reasonable person would act upon it, the order would be
              perverse. But if there is some evidence on record which is
              acceptable and which could be relied upon, howsoever
              compendious it may be, the conclusions would not be
              treated as perverse and the findings would not          be

                    Delhi, in      support of the charges, he was not

                    officer examined the charged officer but nothing is
                    elicited to connect him with the charge. The
                    statement of the appellant recorded by the enquiry
                    officer shows no more than his working earlier to
                    his re-engagement during the period between May
                    1978 and November 1979 in difference phases.
                    Indeed, his statement was not relied upon by the
                    enquiry officer. The finding of the enquiry officer

                    proved is, in the light of the above discussion,
                    erroneous. In our view, this is clearly a case of
                    finding the appellant guilty of .charge without
                    having any evidence to link the appellant with the
                    alleged misconduct. The High Court did not
                    consider this aspect in its proper perspective as

              applicant ex-parte and recorded the evidence, he should
              have adjourned the hearing to another date to enable the
              applicant to participate in the enquiry hereafter/or even
              if the inquiry authority did not choose to give the
              applicant an opportunity to cross-examine the witness
              examined in support of the charge, he should have given
              an opportunity to the applicant to appear and then
              proceeded to question him under sub-rule 18 of Rule 14
              of CCS (CCA) Rules. The omission to do this is a serious
              error committed by the enquiry authority. Secondly, we

               notice that the enquiry authority has marked as many as
              7 documents in support of the charge, while SW-1 has
              proved only one document, namely, the statement of Smt.
              K.R. Aruna alleged to have been recorded in his
              presence. How the other documents were received in
              evidence are not explained either in the report of the
              enquiry authority or in the proceedings. Even if the
              documents which were produced along with the charge
              sheet were all taken on record, unless and until the
              applicant had requested the enquiry officer to mark
              certain documents in evidence on his side, the enquiry
              authority had no jurisdiction in marking all those
              documents which he had called for the purpose of
              defending himself on the side of the applicant while he
              has not requested for making of these documents on his
              side. It is seen that some of these documents which is
              marked on the side of the defence not at the instance of
              the applicant, has been made use of by the enquiry
              authority to reach a finding against the applicant. This
              has been accepted by the disciplinary authority also. We
              are of the considered view that this is absolutely
              irregular and has prejudiced the case of the applicant.
              These documents, which were not proved in accordance
              with law should not have been received in evidence and
              that, any inference drawn from these documents is
              misplaced and opposed to law. We further find that the
              enquiry authority as well as, the disciplinary authority
              have freely made use of the statement alleged to have
              been made by Smt. K.R. Aruna in the presence of SW1
              and it was on that basis that they reached the conclusion
              that the applicant was living with Smt. K.R. Aruna and
              that, he was the father of the two children of Smt. K.R.
              Aruna. The S.W. 1 in his deposition which is extracted
              above, has not spoken to the details contained in the
              statement of Smt. K.R. Aruna which was marked as Ex.1.
              Further it is settled law that any statement recorded
              behind the back of a person can be made use of against
              him in a proceeding unless the person who is said to have
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">W.P.(C) 6990/2009                                                         Page 15 of 18</span>
               made that statement is made available for cross-
              examination, to prove his or her veracity. The
              disciplinary authority has not even chosen to include
              Smt. K.R. Aruna in the list of witnesses for offering her
              for being cross-examined for testing the veracity of the
              documents exhibited at Ex. 1 which is said to be her
              statement. Therefore, we have no hesitation in coming to
              the conclusion that the enquiry authority as well as, the
              disciplinary authority have gone wrong in placing
              reliance on Ex. 1 which is the alleged statement of Smt.
              K.R. Aruna without offering Smt. K.R. Aruna as a witness
              for cross-examination. The applicant's case is that the
              statement was recorded under coercion and duress and
              the finding based on this statement is absolutely
              unsustainable as the same is not based on legal evidence.
              The other documents relied on by the Enquiry authority,
              as well as by the disciplinary authority for reaching the
              conclusion that the applicant and Smt. K.R. Aruna were
              living together and that they have begotten two children
              have also been not proved in the manner in which they
              are required to be proved."

              evidences to prove the charge. Although the charges in a
              departmental proceedings are not required to be proved
              like a criminal trial, i.e., beyond all reasonable doubts,
              we cannot lose sight of the fact that the Enquiry Officer
              performs a quasi-judicial function, who upon analysing
              the documents must arrive at a conclusion that there had

<p id="p_20">18.    On perusal of facts, submissions of both the counsels and law laid down by
       the Hon'ble Apex Court in regard to the present case, we are in consonance
       with the view of the Tribunal that the order passed by the Disciplinary
       Authority and Appellate Authority are quashed and set aside and the law in
       this regard is well settled by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in many cases.
       Therefore, we find that the whole edifice of the enquiry has no foundation,
       which will collapse at the slightest probing. The counsel for the Respondent
       has given brief of his defence to the Enquiry Officer, which a very well
       drafted document with cogent argument to repel the case of the prosecution.
       Not even one point of fact is considered by the Enquiry Officer. No
       cognizance is taken by the Appellate Authority. The points raised in the
       present petition, the order of the Appellate Authority is laconic and is a non-
       speaking order.
