                      K.SURENDRA MOHAN, J.
                     ------------------------------------
                       W.P.(C) No.16689 of 2008
                     -----------------------------------
               Dated this the 10th day of February, 2015

                            J U D G M E N T
</pre>
<p id="p_1">      The petitioners had availed financial assistance from the 1st

respondent Bank for various businesses conducted by them. The 1st

petitioner had availed an amount of 56 lakhs for a Textile Shop, the

2nd petitioner had availed a facility of 10 lakhs, the 3rd petitioner had

availed a facility of 23 lakhs and the 4th petitioner had availed a

Housing Loan of 12 lakhs.          According to the petitioners, due to

differences of opinion that arose between the petitioners and the

Branch Manager of the 1st respondent, proceedings were initiated

against them under the provisions of the Securitisation and

Reconstruction of Financial Assets and <a href="/doc/198257891/" id="a_1">Enforcement of Security Interest

Act</a>, 2002 ('<a href="/doc/52229129/" id="a_2">SARFAESI Act</a>', for short). The accounts were declared as

Non Performing Assets ('NPA' for short) and notices were issued under

<a href="/doc/198257891/" id="a_3">Section 13(2)</a> of the Act on 01.08.2007. The petitioners challenged the

said action before this Court in W.P.(C).No.27563/2007. By Ext.P11

judgment, this Court considered the legality of the action initiated by

the 1st respondent and found that, the entire action was arbitrary.

Therefore, the action was set aside.         It has also been declared in

Ext.P11 judgment that, the action of the 1st respondent Bank in

classifying the accounts of the petitioners as NPA was illegal and

arbitrary. This Court further directed that a Superior Officer of the

W.P.(C) No.16689 of 2008
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                     2</span>

Bank shall re-examine the question whether the accounts of the

petitioners were liable to be classified as NPA strictly following the

guidelines of the Reserve Bank of India. Accordingly, the matter was

reconsidered and by Ext.P12, the 5th respondent has found that the

initial action of the Bank in declaring the accounts of the petitioners as

NPA was justified. Pursuant to Ext.P12, petitioners were also issued

with Ext.P13 notice to show cause why their names should not be

communicated to the Reserve Bank of India for being notified in the list

of chronic defaulters. This writ petition was filed by the petitioner in

the said circumstances challenging Ext.P12. It is submitted by the

counsel for the petitioner that, no further action was pursued on the

basis of Ext.P13.
</p>
<p id="p_2">       2. According to Dr.George Abraham who appears for the

petitioners, this Court has held in Ext.P7 judgment that the action of

the 1st respondent Bank in treating the petitioners' accounts as NPA

was arbitrary. The respondents have had no case at any time that

there were other materials on the basis of which, the petitioners'

accounts were liable to be treated as NPA. What the 5th respondent

has done in Ext.P12 is to search out other materials to support the

action that has been found to be arbitrary by this Court in Ext.P11

judgment. Since this Court has held that the said action was arbitrary

and illegal in Ext.P11, which finding has become final and binding, with

Writ Appeal No.2716/2007 filed challenging the said judgment being

W.P.(C) No.16689 of 2008
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                     3</span>

dismissed, it is not open to the 5th respondent to clothe the said action

with a cloak of legality. Ext.P12, in so far as it reiterates the earlier

illegal action, is according to the counsel arbitrary and liable to be set

aside.
</p>
<p id="p_3">       3. A counter affidavit has been filed on behalf of the respondents.

It is stated in paragraph 3 of the counter affidavit that, the Bank has

already filed O.A.No.245/2008 before the Debt Recovery Tribunal,

Ernakulam for recovery of the amounts due from the petitioners.

According to the counter affidavit, the accounts were classified as NPA

for the reason that, the outstanding balance as on 31.12.2006 and 90

days thereafter exceeded the sanctioned limit and there was no credit

in the accounts. It is reiterated that, the action initiated by the Bank

was perfectly legal. According to the counter affidavit, this Court had

granted liberty to a Superior Officer of the Bank to consider the matter

afresh and to take a fresh decision. Such a decision had been taken

even during the pendency of the Writ Appeal No.2716/2007 filed by

the Bank. It was for the said reason that the said Writ Appeal was

dismissed as infructuous. According to the counter affidavit, there are

absolutely    no     grounds   for  any    interference    with   Ext.P12.

Adv.Sri.A.S.P.Kurup appears for the respondents.

</p><p id="p_4">       4. Heard.     A perusal of Ext.P12 order shows that, the 5th

respondent has gone into the documents relating to the accounts of

the petitioners in detail. He has found that the outstanding balance in

W.P.(C) No.16689 of 2008
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                        4</span>

the accounts as on 31.12.2006 had exceeded the sanctioned limit/

drawing power and that there was no sufficient credit in the accounts

of the petitioners. The 5th respondent has sought to justify the action

of the Bank in declaring the accounts of the petitioners as NPA on the

basis of the above fact. However, it is not in dispute that, action was

initiated in respect of the accounts only on 31.03.2007. Though the

respondents had contested the writ petition filed by the petitioners

before this Court, I do not find that that the above facts had been

brought to the notice of this Court at the time of rendering Ext.P11

judgment. Therefore, the impression that one gets from a reading of

Ext.P12 is that, the 5th respondent was only trying to justify the action

taken against the petitioners in spite of the fact that, the said action

had been held to be arbitrary by this Court. The wording of Ext.P12

also supports the above conclusion. What has been stated in Ext.P12

by the 5th respondent is that, he was confirming the action classifying

the accounts as NPA. The 5th respondent has while entering the said

finding, lost sight of the fact that, this Court had declared the said

action to be arbitrary.      The relevant observation of this Court in

Paragraph 28 of Ext.P11 judgment reads as follows :

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">                  "In the result, I declare that the action of the 1st

           respondent Bank in classifying the accounts of the

           petitioners as NPA is illegal and arbitrary and a superior

           officer of the Bank shall re-examine the question

           whether the accounts of the petitioners are liable to be

W.P.(C) No.16689 of 2008
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                        5</span>

           classified as NPAs strictly following the guidelines issued

           by the Reserve Bank of India."</blockquote><p id="p_5">

</p><p id="p_6">      5. In the above context, the observation of this Court in

Paragraph 23 of the judgment is also relevant, which is extracted

hereunder :
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">             "In this context I should refer to the judgment of the Apex

      Court in <a href="/doc/1059476/" id="a_4">Mardia Chemicals v. Union of India</a> {2004 (2) KLT 273

      (SC)} in which the question as to whether it is on the whims and

      fancies of the financial institutions to classify the assets as non-

      performing assets, has been dealt with in paragraph 37. It has

      been held that as a matter of fact a policy has been laid down by

      the Reserve Bank of India providing guidelines in the matter of

      declaring an asset as a non-performing asset and that is quite

      evident from the guidelines laid down by the Reserve Bank of

      India laying down the terms and conditions and circumstances in

      which the debt is to be classified as non-performing asset as

      early as possible.   Referring to the said guidelines the court

      found that there are guidelines for treating the debt as a non-

      performing asset. I am afraid that the argument raised before

      the Apex Court has come true in this case."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_7">The above observations are a pointer to the attitude of the Bank

towards the petitioners. At the time of initiation of action against them

viewed in the above background, it has to be held that the manner in

which the whole issue has been considered in Ext.P12 is unsatisfactory.

</p><p id="p_8">      6. As already noticed above, the Bank has approached the Debt

Recovery Tribunal by filing O.A.No.245/2008 seeking recovery of the

amount due from the petitioners. According to the counsel for the

petitioners, the said case is pending and as per orders in the said O.A,

W.P.(C) No.16689 of 2008
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                     6</span>

substantial portion of the amounts demanded have already been paid.

S.A.No.235/2009 is also another case that is pending in relation to the

recovery of the very same amount. Since the said proceedings are

progressing before the Debt Recovery Tribunal, it is sufficient that the

parties are left to work out their remedies in the said proceedings.

</p><p id="p_9">      In view of the above, this writ petition is disposed of leaving the

parties to work out their remedies in O.A.No.245/2008 and

S.A.No.235/2009 pending before the Debt Recovery Tribunal. Suffice it

to order that, no further action shall be pursued against the petitioner

on the basis of Ext.P13.
