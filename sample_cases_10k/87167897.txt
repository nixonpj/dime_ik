<pre id="pre_1">     85
24.12.2010                   W.P.23565 (W) of 2010

             Mr. Ekramul Bari
             Mr. Syed Mansur Ali
                 ...for the Petitioner

             Mr. Jitendra Lal Das
                    ...for the State



                  The petitioner has retired from service on 30.6.2010. He is aggrieved

             by contents of memo No.207/PC dated 18.6.2010 issued by the District

             Inspector of Schools (S.E.), Howrah. It appears therefrom that an objection

             has been raised regarding the drawal of Honours scale of pay by the

             petitioner while he was in service. The school has been asked to submit

             either the sanction order or to recover overdrawal of pay and allowances

             after calculating the same.

                   Mr. Bari, learned counsel for the petitioner, contends that excess

             payment, if at all made to the petitioner, was not occasioned as a result of

             any misrepresentation or fraud committed by him and such excess

             payment may have been made upon erroneous appreciation of the principle

             for calculating pay and allowances. He submits that in such a case the

             petitioner cannot be penalised by deducting any amount from the retiral

             benefits payable to him. In support of his submission, Mr. Bari has relied

             on a decision of the Apex Court reported in   2009 (1) Supreme 163 (Syed

             Abdul Kader-Vs.-State of Bihar &amp; Ors.). He, accordingly, prays for a

             direction on the respondents to release the said amount with interest.</pre>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                    2</span>




<p id="p_1">       Mr. Das, learned counsel for the State respondents, submits that the

pension payment order was not issued due to the audit objection, since

communicated by the District Inspector, and consequently, the petitioner

has not received his retiral benefits. According to him the petitioner is not

entitled to retain benefits that were extended to him not in accordance with

law.
</p>
<p id="p_2">       Having heard learned counsel for the parties and considering the

nature of controversy raised in this petition and also in view of the fact that

the petitioner has retired from service on 30.6.2010, this Court is of the

considered view that inviting affidavits from the respondents would lead

only to delay in giving a decision on the controversy raised and, therefore,

it is inappropriate to keep the writ petition pending.

</p><p id="p_3">       Keeping in view the ratio of the decision in Syed Abdul Kader (supra),

this petition stands disposed of with a direction upon the District

Inspector, respondent no.3, to conduct necessary enquiry for ascertaining

whether excess amount was paid to the petitioner on account of any

misrepresentation or fraud on his part or not. Such exercise shall be

conducted upon granting a reasonable opportunity of hearing to the

petitioner as well as person/persons whom he considers necessary to be

heard in this respect. It is made clear that he shall complete this exercise

within a period of sixteen weeks from date of receipt of a copy of this order.

</p><p id="p_4">       If the District Inspector seeks to maintain the audit objection of

deducting the amount paid in excess from the retiral benefits payable to

the petitioner, he shall pass a reasoned order.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                      3</span><p id="p_5">




</p><p id="p_6">      In the event, however, the District Inspector of Schools fails to

complete the enquiry within the aforesaid period of sixteen weeks, it shall

be   deemed    that   excess    payment     had    not   been   made   due   to

misrepresentation or fraud on the part of the petitioner and the retiral

benefits shall be paid to him with interest @ 5% calculated from the date of

his retirement till actual payment.
</p>
<p id="p_7">      This Court further makes it clear that if excess payment had been

made to the petitioner on the basis of application of a wrong principle for

calculating pay and allowances or on the basis of wrong interpretation of a

particular order, the petitioner shall not be penalized and he shall be

entitled to full retiral benefits as directed above.

</p><p id="p_8">      The writ petition stands disposed of with the above direction.

      There shall be no order as to costs.
</p>
<p id="p_9">      Urgent certified photostat copy of this order if applied for, be

supplied to the parties expeditiously.
</p>
