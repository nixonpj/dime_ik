            argued that, though, an annual confidential report is recorded in

            exercise of administrative power, but where the Administrative Judge

            proceeds to record an adverse comment, it is imperative that

            reference be made to material available or circumstances that

            support the adverse comment. A perusal of the adverse report,

            orders passed by the Administrative Judge while rejecting the

            petitioner's representations, orders passed by the Administrative

            Committee              and orders passed by the Full Bench do not contain

            reference to any material that could even remotely suggest that the

            integrity of the petitioner is doubtful.            It is further argued that the

            adverse report is the out come of malafides of Mr. Mukesh Mittal,

            Advocate,             respondent     no.3,   who is a close      friend   of the

            Administrative Judge. A perusal of the reply filed by respondent no.3

            bears out the proximity between respondent no.3 and the

            Administrative Judge. Mr. Mukesh Mittal, Advocate, filed an

            application for transfer of a civil suit, pending before the petitioner.

            The District Judge, Panchkula, asked the petitioner to furnish his

            comments. The petitioner, while furnishing comments, made certain

            remarks against respondent no.3. The remarks enraged respondent

            no.3, who threatened to get even with the petitioner and thereafter,

            poisoned the mind of the Administrative Judge, leading to the

            adverse report. The petitioner's allegation of bias is borne out from

            the order rejecting his representation. The Administrative Judge has

            referred to certain facts, stated to have been disclosed by the

            petitioner during personal hearing, that were never disclosed, thereby

            clearly

            consideration. A reference, in the order rejecting the representation,

            to an unfair means case against the petitioner while he was

            appearing in the Civil Service( Preliminary) Examination, 1989 clearly

            reveals a biased mind bent upon punishing the petitioner. The fact

            that while rejecting the second representation, an enquiry was

            ordered in a complaint, that had already been withdrawn, fortifies the

            plea of bias. It is further submitted that, though, an annual

            confidential report is recorded in discharge of administrative duties

            and is based upon subjective satisfaction of the reporting officer, but

            where material exists to indicate bias or possibility of bias, such an

            adverse report has to be set aside. It is further submitted that the

            adverse report does not refer to any complaint or material received

            by the Administrative Judge from any member of the public, a litigant

            or an advocate, or to any rumour against the integrity of the

            petitioner. It is further submitted that bias is evident from the fact that

            on 05.03.2009, the Administrative Judge ordered that allegations in

            Criminal Misc. No.M-27254 of 2008 be investigated despite the fact

            that the said petition had already been withdrawn on the judicial side

            and had been considered and filed on the administrative side by the

            Administrative Judge, who succeeded the Administrative Judge

            concerned. The persistence of the Administrative Judge in pursing

            his agenda against the petitioner continued unabated and eventually

            led to rejection of the petitioner's representations after a period of

            about five years. The petitioner has been demoted to the rank of

            Civil Judge (Senior Division) due to interference by the Administrative

            Judge, though, in the case of other officers, this course has not been

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">             Civil Writ Petition No.4567 of 2011                                   -7-</span>

            adopted.           It is further submitted that material referred to by the

            Administrative Judge to justify the          adverse   report is insufficient

            even to record a           subjective opinion. It is further argued that the

            Committee of Judges did afford an opportunity of hearing to the

            petitioner but as the Committee did not share any adverse material

            with the petitioner, the opportunity of hearing, was a mere eyewash.

            The possibility of bias, as a fact, is clearly discernible from orders

            passed on the administrative side and even if the petitioner is unable

            to establish bias, as a fact the possibility of bias cannot be ruled out.

            The possibility of bias, in administrative action is to be tested on the

            anvil of "reasonable suspicion" and "real likelihood of bias". A court

            must, therefore, address, to itself, a question whether there is a

            reasonable possibility of bias as opposed to tangible evidence of

            bias and if answer to this question is in the affirmative, quash the

            administrative action on the ground of bias. A reference in this regard

            is made to AIR 1986 SCC, 11, <a href="/doc/884513/" id="a_1">Tata Cellular vs. Union of India</a>.

            In support of his argument, that fairness in administrative action, is to

            be adjudged on the basis of material available on record and cannot

            be based upon mere rumours of allegations and in the absence of

            any substantial material to raise an inference that the integrity of the

            petitioner was in serious doubt, an adverse report is not warranted,

            Counsel for the petitioner relies upon the following judgments:-

                                        employment.      Judges     are    discharging     their

            objective, dispassionate and constructive estimation of the character,

            ability, integrity etc. of the officer concerned. It is equally true that,

            though, it may not be a part of the record but conduct, reputation and

            character, acquire public knowledge and may come to the notice of

            the Administrative Judge and though, desirable that a report should

            be based upon verifiable material, so as to disabuse any doubts as to

            its bonafides, it is not imperative that material be referred to while

            recording an expression of "doubt" about the integrity of an officer.

            More often than not verifiable material, as incontrovertible proof of

            doubtful integrity, is near impossible to collect. An entry of doubtful

            integrity would always depend upon the subjective satisfaction of the

            Administrative Judge and if not vitiated, by patent malafide,

            prejudice, or bias, provided the reporting officer is impleaded as a

            party, has to be accepted as a bonafide expression of opinion. The

            possibility of a motivated adverse report to punish an honest officer

            cannot be ruled out but the touchstone of adjudging the legality of an

            adverse report, still remains the same. An Administrative Judge has

            occasion, during the course of an year, to examine the work of a

            judicial officer, to assess the officer's reputation after interacting with

            the officer, litigants, members of the public, members of the bar and

            other respectables.             The power to record an annual confidential

            report is administrative in nature, based upon subjective satisfaction

            but must disclose an impartial and fair assessment of the

            performance of an officer.

            said to be actuated by malafide, prejudice, bias or the possibility of

            bias. Admittedly, the petitioner has not impleaded the author of the

            adverse report i.e., the person who is alleged to have recorded the

            adverse report in a malafide exercise of power occasioned by bias.

            The petitioner has instead impleaded Mr. Mukesh Mittal, Advocate,

            as respondent no.3 by alleging that he is the person responsible for

            influencing the mind of the Administrative Judge leading to a

            vindictive, malafide and biased exercise of administrative powers

            the precedents cited by counsel for the petitioner, leave no ambiguity

            that if facts of a case raise an inference of malafide, bias or even

            possibility of bias, in recording of an adverse report and orders

            rejecting representations or orders confirming an adverse report,

            such reports and orders, would necessarily be vitiated for malafides,

            bias or the possibility of bias. Whatever be the nature of an order, if

            founded on malafide, bias or possibility of bias, such an order cannot

            possibly sustain the test of judicial scrutiny. An order passed by a

            malafide or a biased mind, is repugnant to the concept of fairness

            that underlines orders whether administrative or judicial and,

            therefore, infringes the rights of the affected person and casts a

            consideration, it is necessary that the person who is alleged to have

            passed an order founded on malafide, bias or the possibility of bias

            be arrayed as a party. The sine-quo-non for considering allegations

            of malafides/bias is the impleading of the person whose act is stated

            to be actuated by malafide or bias. The petitioner, while levelling

            allegations of malafide against respondent no.3 calls upon us to raise

            an inference of bias or possibility of bias against the Administrative

            Judge, but without arraying the latter           as a respondent.   If the

            petitioner was sanguine of the correctness of his allegations, he

            should have been honest enough to implead the                author of the

            adverse report.             The allegations levelled by the petitioner are

            intended to impinge upon the integrity of the adverse report etc. and

            as a necessary consequence upon the integrity of the Administrative

            Judge. The petitioner was, therefore, required to implead the author

            of the adverse report as a pre-condition to consideration of his

            allegation of malafide, bias or the possibility of bias. The failure of the

            petitioner to implead the author of the adverse report, disentitles the

</p><p id="p_75">                               Counsel for the petitioner has with a great degree of

            erudition made a valiant attempt to convince us to take a view that

            where facts of a case disclose the possibility of bias, as opposed to

            allegations of malafide or bias, it is not necessary to implead the

            person who has passed the impugned order or recorded the

            impugned adverse report. After considering this fervent plea and

            conscious of the fact that a subordinate officer may hesitate to

            implead an Administrative Judge, we have no hesitation in recording

            that as "possibility of bias" is a species of "bias" similar in fact and

            consequence to a plea of malafide or bias, such a plea cannot be

            considered without a petitioner impleading the person said to have

            recorded the adverse report and passed orders actuated by the

            possibility of bias. Accepting the plea raised by the petitioner that an

            inference of possibility of bias, can be raised without impleading the

            concerned person, would in essence require us to discard the basic

            principle that no person shall be condemned unheard and require us

            to travel into the realm           of speculation, and on the basis of a

            speculative process of reasoning infer a possibility of bias, a course

            we are not inclined to tread. There is another reason why we have

<p id="p_76">                               A perusal of the facts reveals that the adverse report, orders

            rejecting the representations, were considered by an Administrative

            Committee twice over and on one occasion by affording an

            opportunity of personal hearing to the petitioner. The adverse report

            etc. were affirmed by the Full Court. It would be near impossible for

            us to hold that there is possibility of bias in orders passed by

            Administrative Committees, of which the Administrative Judge was

            not a member, and the Full Court. It cannot possibly be held that

            Hon'ble Judges of the Committee,                    were so powerless or so

            influenced by the Administrative Judge as to toe his line or disregard

            their primary duty to ensure that a person is not victimised, by a

            malafide adverse report, actuated by malice or bias. The petitioner

            filed a representation, which was rejected by the Administrative

            Judge. The petitioner filed a fresh representation. The matter was,

            thereafter, placed before Administrative Judge, who once again

            rejected the representation.               The matter was placed before an

            Administrative Committee which rejected the representations. The

            Full Court requested the Committee to reconsider the matter. After

            reconsideration, the Committee reiterated its earlier decision and

            thereafter the Full Court affirmed the impugned adverse report and

            orders             rejecting   the   representations.   We,   therefore,   fail   to

            comprehend as to how a plea of malafide, bias or possibility of bias

            would still be available to the petitioner.
