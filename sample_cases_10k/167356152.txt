<p id="p_1">          This is a final report filed by the PSI of Vivekanagar P.S.
   against the accused for the offences punishable under <a href="/doc/1599401/" id="a_1">Section
   341</a>, <a href="/doc/724142/" id="a_2">324</a> and <a href="/doc/180217/" id="a_3">506</a> of IPC.
</p>
<p id="p_2">          2. BRIEF FACTS:-
</p>
<p id="p_3">          The case of prosecution is that on 05.11.2015 at about
   7.00   P.M   in   front   of   infant    Jesus      Church   within   the
   jurisdictional limits of Vivekanagar Police Station the accused
   wrongfully restrained CW-1, assaulted with helmet on his face
   and head causing injury and criminally intimidated him.

<p id="p_4">        3.    Based on the first information, the police have
registered the case, investigation was conducted and after
completion of the investigation final report filed against the
accused.
</p>
<p id="p_5">        4. The accused has entered appearance in response to the
summons and has been enlarged on bail.            The prosecution
papers have been supplied to the accused. After hearing, the
charge against the accused was framed to which he pleaded not
guilty and claimed to be tried.
</p>
<p id="p_6">        4. The prosecution has examined PW.1 and Ex.P1 &amp;
Ex.P2 are exhibited. The statement of the accused is dispensed
with.
</p><p id="p_7">        5. Heard both sides.
</p>
<p id="p_8">        6. The following points arise for my consideration.
</p>
<p id="p_9">              1. Whether the prosecution proves beyond
              reasonable doubt that on 05.11.2015 at about
              7.00 P.M in front of Infant Jesus Church within
              the jurisdictional limits of Vivekanagar Police
              Station accused wrongfully restrained CW-1 and
              thereby committed an offence punishable under
              <a href="/doc/1599401/" id="a_4">Section 341</a> of IPC?
</p>
<p id="p_10">              2. Whether the prosecution proves beyond
              reasonable doubt that on above mentioned date,
              time and place accused assaulted CW-1 with
              helmet on his head and face causing injury and
              thereby committed an offence punishable under
              <a href="/doc/724142/" id="a_5">Section 324</a> of IPC?
</p><p id="p_11">              3. Whether the prosecution proves beyond
              reasonable doubt that on above mentioned date,
              time and place accused criminally intimidated
              CW-1 and thereby committed an offence
              punishable under <a href="/doc/180217/" id="a_6">Section 506</a> of IPC?
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                   3                            CC.No.50146/2016</span>




<p id="p_12">               4. What order?
</p><p id="p_13">     7. My answer of the aforesaid points.
</p><p id="p_14">                Point No.1 to 3 - In the Negative
                Point No.4   -   As per final order for the
                                 following

                             REASONS
</p><p id="p_15">      8. Point No.1 to 3 :
</p>
<p id="p_16">      As the facts pertaining to these points are related to each
other, all these points are taken together for common discussion
for brevity.
</p>
<p id="p_17">      PW.1 testifies that he knows the accused.               That the
accused has neither wrongfully restrained, assaulted nor
criminally intimidated him nor he has lodged the complaint in
this regard.     Although PW.1 subscribes to his signature
appearing in Ex.P1 which is the complaint and Ex.P2 which is
mahazar, he pleads ignorance to the contents of Ex.P1 and
Ex.P2.   PW.1 admits to have compromised with the accused.
PW.1 is treated hostile and cross-examined by the Ld.Sr.APP
wherein nothing substantial is elicited in order to support the
case of prosecution.
</p>
<p id="p_18">      9. This Court was of the opinion that PW.1 is the only
material witness who has turned hostile and therefore the
remaining witnesses were dropped by rejecting the prayer of
Ld.Sr.APP.
</p>
<p id="p_19">      10. On considering the evidence of PW.1 and the
complaint at Ex.P1, the evidence of PW.1 appears to be
contradictory. The evidence of PW.1 is not inconsonance with
Ex.P1. PW.1 has admitted to have compromised with the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                        4                                CC.No.50146/2016</span>




accused. The prosecution is unable to establish the guilt of the
accused beyond reasonable doubt.                  Since there is nothing
incriminating against the accused, the only inference that could
be drawn is that the accused is innocent of the offences leveled
against them.        Hence the accused deserves to be acquitted.
Therefore I answer point No.1 to 3 in the NEGATIVE.
</p><p id="p_20">       11. Point No.4 : For the aforesaid reasons, I proceed to
pass the following:
</p><p id="p_21">                                   <a href="/doc/181955/" id="a_7">ORDER

cancelled.
