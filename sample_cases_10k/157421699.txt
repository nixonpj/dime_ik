</p><p id="p_11">6. Notice of the petition was served upon all the respondent. R-1 not opted to file

  the written statement however, written statement on behalf of R-2 and R-3 was

  filed separately. R-2 controverted all the allegations as alleged in the petition

  and also took many preliminary objections such as petition is not maintainable

  on the ground that petitioner has not approached the court with clean hands

  and concealed the material facts before this court. It is further pleaded that

  alleged accident has not been caused with the alleged offending vehicle of the

  answering respondent, therefore, there is no cause of action in favour of

</p><p id="p_15">9. R-3 Insurance company also controverted all the allegations as alleged in the

  petition and took many preliminary objections such as the alleged accident

  took place on 23.1.08 whereas the copy of insurance cover note relied upon

  by the petitioner clearly shows the period of insurance from 23.1.08 to 22.1.09

  thereby it is established that insured (R-2) obtained the insurance cover note

  after the accident and was not insured with the answering respondent at the

  time of accident i.e 23.1.08 at about 11:00 a.m, therefore, anserwing

  respondent is not a necessary party to the petition and requested for deleting

</p><p id="p_39">24.Arguments on behalf of counsel for petitioner as well as on behalf of

  respondents heard.        On the basis of arguments advanced and the evidence

  adduced by both the parties my findings on the issues are as follows :</p><pre id="pre_3">

  ISSUE -1

             i)          Whether Sh. Hitesh Sahni and Sh. Bishamber
                         Nath Sahini sustained injuries due to rash
                         and negligent driving of TATA 407 Truck No.

             ii)         Whether alleged vehicle was not involved in
                         the alleged accident and if so, to what effect?
                         OPR2

</pre><p id="p_40">25.On both these issue, petitioner appeared as PW1 and filed his affidavit Ex. P.3

  and in his affidavit he mentioned all the facts which were stated by him in the

  petition with regard to rash and negligent driving of the offending vehicle by R-

  1, factum of hitting the vehicle with the motorcycle of petitioner due to that they

  both received injuries. He also corroborated the factam of registration of a

  case u/s 279/337 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_5">IPC</a> vide FIR no. 32/08 against R-1. He also corroborated

  the fact that both the injured including petitioner were taken to Deepak

  Memorial hospital and they both received serious injuries. Testimony of PW3

  is further corroborated by PW2. He also stated all the facts which were stated

  by him in his petition as well as by PW2. He specifically deposed that after

  receiving injuries he was taken to Deepak Memorial Hospital and remained

  admitted there from 23.1.08 to 27.1.08. On perusal of the mechanical

  inspection of the vehicle wherein it is mentioned that left side front bumper

  dented/pressed again corroborates the fact that the vehicle is involved in the

  said accident. MLC of injured prepared by the Dr. of Deepak Memorial hospital

  further corroborates the fact that petitioner received injuries on the date, time

  and place of accident and was admitted to Deepak Memorial hospital in an

  injured condition. The nature of injuries is also proved.

  to the testimony of PW3 is brought on record by the respondents including R-

  PW1 on this particular issue and accordingly, it is established that on 23.1.08

  petitioner Hitesh was driving motorcycle no. DL-7SR-8021 while his father was

  sitting as pillion rider and when they reached at Road no.57, Near Karkari

  More in front of Parwana Road, Near Jagat Puri Flyover in the meantime a

  down and sustained grievous injuries.

<p id="p_43">


</p><p id="p_44">27.Accordingly, I decide both these issue in favour of petitioner and against the

  respondents.
</p>
<p id="p_45">  ISSUE NO.2

</p><p id="p_46">            iii)         Whether the petitioners are entitled to get any
                         compensation if so, from whom and of what
                         amount?
</p>
<p id="p_47">   28. As regard the quantum of compensation the petitioner has to be

      compensated for the actual expenses incurred by him and as regards the

      medical expenses incurred by the petitioner he had filed the medical bills

      to the tune of Rs.11,158/- . Thereby the petitioner has become entitled for

      Rs.11,158/- towards medical expenses.
</p>
<p id="p_48">

</p><p id="p_49">   29. On   perusal      of   discharge   summary     and   medical record   of   the

      injured/petitioner and also keeping in view the nature of injuries was

      opined as grevious and the petitioner was discharged on 27.1.08 but no

      proof of any disability pursuant to the aforesaid injuries is brought on

      record.

</p><p id="p_52">30. Petitioner claimed his age as 20 years on the date of accident and same

   age is also mentioned on the driving license of Hitesh Sahini.               No

   evidence contrary to the evidence placed on record by the petitioner is

   produced by the respondent. Therefore, considering all the circumstances

   as brought on the record the age of the petitioner on the date of accident

   should not be taken as less than 20 years. Admittedly, the petitioner was

   working as Software Engg at M/s Star Touch India Pvt. Ltd. But neither

   the proof of income nor the proof of incurring expenses towards better

   diet, attendant and conveyance is placed on record but possibility of

   incurring all such expenses cannot be ruled out.
</p>
<p id="p_53">

</p><p id="p_54">31. Since it is case of simple injury therefore, the compensation in such type

   of cases can only be assessed on the basis of          provisions of Second

   Schedule Clause (4) of the <a href="/doc/785258/" id="a_6">Motor Vehicle Act</a> which provided as under:-

 Clause 4 which reads thus:-

<p id="p_55">    General Damages in case of Injuries and Disabilities:</p><pre id="pre_4">

 1. Pain Sufferings
    (a) Grievious injuries                                         Rs. 5000/-
    (b) Non-grievous injuries                                      Rs. 1000/-
 2. Medical Expenses - actual expenses

</p><p id="p_57">32.      On considering the nature of injuries received in the said accident, at

the time of visiting the various hospitals, the possibility of having a attendant

with the petitioner cannot be ruled out and accordingly, I assess Rs. 2,000/- for

the said purpose.
</p>
<p id="p_58">

</p><p id="p_59">33.      however, the pain and suffering of the petitioner in the present case

cannot be measured in terms of money as the suffering is going to be with him

for his whole life and it is only for the purpose of this claim that a sum of Rs.

5,000/- on the minimum is being assessed.
</p>
<p id="p_60">

</p><p id="p_61">34.      Petitioner also incurred expenses towards conveyance and better

diet which I assess to the tune of Rs. 3,000/- each.

</p><p id="p_64">35.      Admittedly the vehicle was insured after the occurrence of this

accident and at the time of accident admittedly the vehilce was not insured,

therefore, Insurance Company is not liable to indemnify R-1 and R-2 however,

respondent no.3 is exonerated to make the compensation.

I carefully perused the evidence adduced by the petitioner and the observation

given by their lordships in the aforesaid case, the petitioner is become entitled

for the total amount of compensation towards all the heads as follows:-
