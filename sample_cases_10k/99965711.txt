IN THE PUNJAB AND HARYANA HIGH COURT AT CHANDIGARH


                                     CR No.3895 of 2011

                                     Date of Decision : 28.2.2012


I.D. Kamboj

CORAM : HON'BLE MR.JUSTICE L.N. MITTAL

Present :   Mr. J.S. Yadav, Advocate for
            Mr. Sachin Mittal, Advocate for the petitioner.

            Mr. R.K. Bhardwaj, respndent No.5 for himself and also on
            behalf of respondents No.1 to 4.

                         ***

L.N.Mittal, J.
</pre>
<p id="p_1">            Claim of respondents No.1 to 5 herein was allowed by

Company Law Board vide order dated 6.10.2003 Annexure P-1 to the extent

that petitioner and proforma respondents No.6 to 12 herein shall pay

principal amount of Rs.3 lacs to respondents No.1 to 5 along with simple

interest thereon @ 15% per annum w.e.f 15.11.1999, in addition to interest

amount of Rs.4.75 lacs accrued till 15.11.99.
</p>
<p id="p_2">            Respondents No.1 to 5 filed execution petition for execution of

the aforesaid order. Learned Executing Court i.e. Additional District Judge,

Panchkula vide order 2.4.2011 Annexure P-6 has directed the Judgment

Debtors i.e. petitioner and proforma respondents No.6 to 12 herein to pay
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1"> CR No.3895 of 2011             -2-</span>


Rs.6,03,363/- as principal amount and Rs.1,86,464/- as interest i.e. total

amount of Rs.7,89,827/-. The said order is under challenge in this revision

petition filed under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_1">Article 227</a> of the Constitution of India by one of the

Judgment Debtors i.e. Judgment Debtor No.1.
</p>
<p id="p_3">             I have heard learned counsel for the petitioner and respondent

No.5 in person appearing for respondents No.1 to 5 decree holders, and

perused the case file.
</p>
<p id="p_4">             Respondent No.5 admitted that respondents No.1 to 5 have

received Rs.2 lacs on 3.4.2007, Rs.3 lacs on 12.5.2007, Rs.2 lacs on

12.6.2008 and Rs.2 lacs on 25.7.2008 i.e. total amount of Rs.9 lacs.

</p><p id="p_5">             Counsel for the petitioner has furnished calculation sheet for

adjustment of the aforesaid amount towards interest that accrued till

25.7.2008 and after adjusting the entire interest amount, to appropriate the

balance amount towards principal amount of Rs.3 lacs. Further interest on

the balance principal amount of Rs.2,66,192/- has also been calculated till

10.3.2009 when another amount of Rs.2 lacs was also admittedly paid to

respondents No.1 to 5. Then further interest amount has been calculated till

17.6.20011 when pursuant to interim order of this Court, amount of

Rs.7,89,827/- was deposited in the Executing Court as per interim order of

this Court. Calculated in this manner, the balance principal amount comes to

Rs.91,134/- as on 18.6.2011 and interest till then comes to Rs.31,085/-.

</p><p id="p_6">             On the other hand, respondent No.5 contended that interest

amount also becomes principal amount for calculating further interest and

therefore, Executing Court has rightly ordered payment of Rs.7,89,827/-.

Reliance has been placed on judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court in 2003

(3) RCR(Civil) 125 titled as Punjab National Bank, Chandigarh Vs.

Progressive Polyplast Co. Pvt. Ltd. and others.
</p>
<p id="p_7">            I have carefully considered the rival contentions.

            Insofar as the judgment in the case of Punjab National Bank,

Chandigarh (supra), is concerned it was laid down that decreed amount

which included principal amount and interest accrued upto filing of suit can

be taken for purpose of calculation on future interest from the date of

institution of suit. However, in the instant case, the Company Law Board

has specifically mentioned that the decree holders shall be entitled to simple

interest only. Moreover, accrued interest amount of Rs.4,75,000/ ordered to

be paid by the Company Law Board was amount of interest accrued till

15.11.1999 whereas proceedings before the Company Law Board had been

initiated in the year 1996. Consequently, the interest amount of Rs.4.75 lacs

was not the amount of interest accrued till before filing of the suit i.e.

proceedings before the Company Law Board entitling the decree holders to

interest on said interest amount also. On the contrary, Company Law Board

vide its order Annexure P-1 which is sought to be executed specifically

negatived the claim of decree holders (respondents No.1 to 5 herein) for

compound interest. Consequently, contention of respondents No.1 to 5 to

claim interest on interest amount of Rs.4.75 lacs which accrued till

15.11.1999, cannot be accepted.
</p>
<p id="p_8">            Calculation furnished by the counsel for the petitioner today in

the Court is apparently correct subject to adjustment of calculation error, if

any. However, respondents No.1 to 5 shall be entitled to interest on balance

principal amount of Rs.91,134/- not only till 17.6.2011 when the amount
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3"> CR No.3895 of 2011             -4-</span>


was deposited by the petitioner in the executing court but also upto

2.11.2011 when this Court ordered release of the principal amount of

Rs.91,134/- and interest amount of Rs.31,085/- (calculated to be due upto

17.6.2011) to respondents No.1 to 5. Accordingly, in addition to principal

amount of Rs.91,134/- and interest amount of Rs.31,085/- ordered to be

released to respondents No.1 to 5 vide order dated 2.11.2011, respondents

No.1 to 5 shall also be entitled to simple interest @ 15% p.a. on the

principal amount of Rs.91,134/- since 18.6.2011 till 2.11.2011. The same

shall be disbursed accordingly to respondents No.1 to 5 out of the amount

of Rs.7,89,827/- deposited by the petitioner in the Executing Court whereas

the balance amount out of the aforesaid deposited amount shall be released

to the petitioner. The Execution petition filed by respondents No.1 to 5

stands satisfied subject to payment of the aforesaid amount and they shall

deliver the share certificates to petitioner and proforma respondents No.6 to

12 as per order of Company Law Board.
