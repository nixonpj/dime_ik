       These Writ Petitions are filed under Articles 226 and 227
of the Constitution of India, praying to quash the order dated
07.08.2014 passed in M.A.No.22/2013 on the file of the Addl.
Senior Civil Judge at Raichur (Itinerary Court at Devadurga),
certified copy of which is at Annexure-G, setting aside the order
dated 22.08.2013 passed on I.A.No.IV and confirming the order
22.08.2013 passed on I.A.No.V in O.S.No.14/2013 on the file of
the Civil Judge at Devadurga, the certified copy of which is at
Annexure-F and consequently, reject I.A.No.IV filed by the
plaintiff in O.S.No.14/2013 and to grant the prayer made in
I.A.No.V filed by the defendant No.3/petitoner herein.

      These writ petitions coming on for Preliminary Hearing
this day, the Court made the following:-


                             ORDER
</pre>

<p id="p_1">      Third defendant in OS.No.14/2013 on the file of Senior

Civil Judge, Raichur, has come up in these petitions impugning

the order dated 7.8.2014 in MA.No.22/2013 on the file of Civil

Judge (Sr.Dn), Raichur (iteninary court at Devadurga), wherein

the lower appellate court while allowing the aforesaid appeal

filed by the plaintiff in OS.No.14/2013 set aside the order

passed by the trial Court on IA.4 in declining to grant temporary

injunction in favour of plaintiff, consequently granted order of

temporary injunction in favour of plaintiff.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                 -3-</span>




</p><p id="p_2">      2. Brief facts leading to these petitions are as under:

      The petitioner herein is third defendant, first respondent

is plaintiff, second and third respondents are defendant Nos.1

and 2 in OS.No.14/2013.        The said suit was filed by first

respondent for the relief of specific performance of agreement of

sale dated 30.1.2006 for sale of 2 acres 36 guntas of land in

land bearing Sy.No.73/P2 situated at Saswigere village of

Deodurga Taluk, Raichur District, which was earlier belonging

to defendant Nos.1 and 2. It is stated that under the agreement

dated 30.1.2006 defendant Nos.1 and 2 agreed to sell the suit

schedule property to plaintiff for valuable consideration of

Rs.3,16,100/-. In that behalf, they received in all a sum of

Rs.2,35,000/- from time to time under various chques from the

plaintiff. Since defendant Nos.1 and 2 failed to execute the sale

deed in respect of suit schedule property, the aforesaid suit for

specific performance was filed by the plaintiff. It is stated even

before the suit for specific performance was initiated, defendant

Nos.1 and 2 have already sold the property in favour of

defendant No.3. Hence, defendant No.3 was also arraigned as

subsequent purchaser in the suit.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                  -4-</span><p id="p_3">




</p><p id="p_4">      3. In the said suit, it is stated that the plaintiff has filed

IA.4 under Order 39 Rules 1 and 2 r/w Section 151 of CPC

seeking the relief of ad interim temporary injunction against

defendant Nos.1 to 3 with reference to his possession and

enjoyment of suit schedule property. It is seen that in the said

proceedings defendant No.3 also filed an application in IA.5

under Order 39 Rules 1 and 2 r/w Section 151 of CPC for the

very same relief. The trial Court, after hearing the counsel for

plaintiff as well as contesting third defendant, proceeded to

dismiss both the applications. However, it is only the plaintiff

being aggrieved by the rejection of his application in IA.4 filed

appeal in MA.No.22/2013 on the file of Additional Senior Civil

Judge,    Raichur   (Itinerary   court   at   Devadurga)    and     the

contesting third defendant did not choose to file an appeal

against   the   rejection   of   his     application   in   IA.5.    In

MA.No.22/2013 filed by the plaintiff, the lower appellate court

on reappreciation of the pleadings proceeded to allow the said

appeal. Consequently, set aside the order on IA.4 in rejecting the

same and by granting the relief of temporary injunction in

favour of the plaintiff allowed the said application.           Being
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                  -5-</span>




aggrieved by the said order, the present petition is filed by

defendant No.3.
</p>
<p id="p_5">      4. Heard the learned counsel for petitioner as well as

contesting first respondent. On going through the pleadings and

the orders impugned of both the courts below, it is seen that the

agreement dated 30.1.2006 said to have executed by defendant

Nos.1 and 2 in favour of plaintiff is not in dispute. It is further

not in dispute that out of the total sale consideration of

Rs.3,16,100/-, defendant Nos.1 and 2 have received a sum of

Rs.2,35,000/- from the plaintiff on various dates under cheques

issued in their favour.      It is also not in dispute that the

agreement that is relied on by the plaintiff discloses that

possession of the suit schedule property was delivered to him

under the agreement. Unless, the said averment is disputed as

incorrect and evidence to that effect is adduced by the

contesting third defendant in the original suit, he cannot find

fault with the finding of the lower appellate court in granting the

relief of temporary injunction in favour of the plaintiff.

</p><p id="p_6">      5. It is also necessary to observe at this juncture that in

the original suit application in IA.5 under Order 39 Rules 1 and

2 r/w Section 151 of CPC was also filed by the third defendant
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                   -6-</span>




seeking temporary injunction as against plaintiff.         Admittedly,

the said application was also dismissed while rejecting the

application filed by the plaintiff in IA.4.    However, rejection of

the plaintiff's application was the subject matter of challenge in

MA.No.22/103, whereas the rejection of third defendant's

application in IA.5 is concerned, he has accepted the same and

did not choose to challenge by filing an appeal. In that view of

the matter, he cannot have any objection to the granting of

temporary injunction in favour of plaintiff in MA.22/2013 by the

lower appellate court when prima facie the agreement discloses

delivery of possession of suit schedule property in favour of

plaintiff as on 2006 i.e., on the date of agreement of sale.

</p><p id="p_7">        6. In that view of the matter, this Court find that no

justifiable grounds are made out to interfere with the order of

lower    appellate   Court   in   allowing    MA.No.22/2013          and

consequently, granting temporary injunction in              favour    of

plaintiff by allowing IA.4 filed in OS.No.14/2013.

</p><p id="p_8">        Accordingly, these writ petitions are dismissed.
