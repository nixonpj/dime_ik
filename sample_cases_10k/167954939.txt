CORAM:
HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE R.K.GAUBA

                         ORDER (ORAL)
</pre><p id="p_1">1.      The second respondent was married to the first petitioner as per
Hindu rites and ceremonies on 27.05.2013. The marriage ran into
rough weather and they started living separately since 20.08.2014. The
second respondent raised allegations of she having been subjected to
cruelty and deprived of her stridhan, first information report (FIR) no.
33/2015 having been registered on 24.01.2015 by police station Civil
lines, Delhi, on her complaint involving offences punishable under
<a href="/doc/538436/" id="a_1">Sections 498A</a>, <a href="/doc/988620/" id="a_2">406</a>, <a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_3">34</a> of Indian Penal Code, 1860 (<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_4">IPC</a>), the case
being directed against her husband (first petitioner), his father (second


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">Crl. M.C. No.1165/2019                                     Page 1 of 7</span>
 petitioner), his brother (third petitioner) and his uncle (fourth
petitioner). On conclusion of the investigation, police filed report
(charge-sheet) under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_5">Section 173</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure,
1973 (Cr. PC) on which cognizance was taken, the said matter now
pending on the file of the Metropolitan Magistrate.
</p>
<p id="p_2">2.      The matter was amicably settled and all the claims and disputes
were resolved through settlement deed dated 26.07.2017, between the
first petitioner and second respondent, before the Ld. Addl. Principal
Judge (central) Tis Hazari. It was agreed as per the said settlement
deed, that the husband shall pay to the wife a sum of Rs. 3,50,000/- as
full and final settlement towards her claim for dowry articles,
jewellery, stridhan, maintenance (past, present and future).
</p>
<p id="p_3">3.      Pursuant to the said settlement, the parties had earlier
approached the family court which has granted decree of divorce by
mutual consent on 30.07.2018 in HMA Petition no. 877/18.
</p>
<p id="p_4">4.      The present petition was filed on the basis of aforementioned
settlement seeking quashing of the proceedings in the criminal case.
</p>
<p id="p_5">5.      The second respondent, on notice, has entered appeared and
pursuant to the directions has filed an affidavit sworn on 13.08.2019,
by which she has confirmed the settlement, giving no objection to the
prayer of the petitioners for quashing of the FIR. Along with the
affidavit she has also filed copy of her aadhar card as proof of her
identity.
</p>



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">Crl. M.C. No.1165/2019                                    Page 2 of 7</span>
<p id="p_6"> 6.      By the above-mentioned affidavit, the second respondent has
confirmed that the dispute has been settled in mediation and they have
obtained decree of divorce by mutual consent. She further stated that
under the said settlement, an amount of Rs.1,50,000/- remains to be
paid by the first petitioner at the time of quashing of FIR.
</p><p id="p_7">7.      At the hearing, the first petitioner has handed over to the second
respondent a demand draft bearing no. 005812, dated 16.08.2019 of
Rs. 1,50,000/- drawn on Axis bank, Mukherjee Nagar, Delhi, a copy
whereof is taken on record.
</p>
<p id="p_8">8.      Pertinent to note here that offence under <a href="/doc/538436/" id="a_6">Section 498A</a> IPC is
not compoundable. The parties are constrained to move this court for
quashing on the basis of amicable resolution arrived at by them in the
facts and circumstances noted above.
</p>
<p id="p_9">9.      The scope and ambit of the power conferred on this court by
<a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_7">Section 482</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (Cr. PC) read
with Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India, in the particular
context of prayer for quashing criminal proceedings, has been the
subject matter of scrutiny and comment by the Supreme Court in a
catena of judgments.       It is well settled that in exercise of this
"inherent" and "wholesome power", the touchstone is as to whether
"the ends of justice so require". This court had the occasion to trace
the relevant law on the subject in a batch of matters led by Yashpal
Chaudhrani vs. State (Govt. of NCT Delhi), 2019 SCC Online Del
8179 wherein after taking note, inter alia, of State of Karnakata v. L
Muniswamy, (1977) 2 SCC 699; State of Karnataka v. M.

principles were culled out as under :-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">      "55. Though the above-noted authoritative pronouncements
      of the Supreme Court have consistently laid down the broad
      principles governing the exercise of power of the High Court
      under Section 482 of the Cr. PC for bringing an end to the
      criminal process, for addressing the concerns noted at the
      outset and future guidance of trial courts, some of the crucial
      ones may be flagged as under:--
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">              (i). The inherent jurisdiction vested in the High
              Court, as recognized and preserved by Section 482
              Cr. PC, is primarily to "prevent abuse of the
              process of court" or to "otherwise secure the ends
              of justice".
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">              (ii). The ends of justice are higher than the ends of
              mere law, the prime principle governing the
              exercise of inherent power being "to do real,
              complete and substantial justice" for which the
              court exists.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">              (iii) It is the duty of the court to give "adequate
              treatment to the settlement between the parties"
              particularly in cases involving compoundable


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">Crl. M.C. No.1165/2019                                       Page 4 of 7</span>
               offences, the exercise of inherent power of the High
              Court under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_14">Section 482</a> Cr.P.C., however, not
              being inhibited in case of non-compoundable
              offences though, for the latter category, such power
              is to be "exercised sparingly and with caution".
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">              (iv). If the criminal case has "overwhelmingly and
              predominantly civil character", particularly if it
              arises out of "commercial" (financial, mercantile,
              partnership or such other) transaction - and this
              would include the "cheque bouncing cases" under
              <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_15">Section 138</a> N.I. Act - or "matrimonial dispute" or
              "family dispute", genuine resolution on equitable
              terms, in entirety, by the parties should result in
              criminal proceedings being quashed.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">              (v). Since the institution of marriage has an
              important role to play in the society, the court is to
              make every effort to encourage the parties to
              terminate such discord amicably and if it appears
              that elements of settlement exist, and the parties
              are willing, they are to be directed to the process of
              mediation to explore the possibility of settlement, it
              being desirable to do so even at the "pre-litigation
              stage".
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_7">              (vi). While examining the prayer for quashing of a
              non compoundable offence, on the basis of
              settlement of the dispute between the wrongful doer
              and the victim, the High Court is to bear in mind as
              to whether the possibility of conviction is "remote
              and oblique" and further, if the continuation of the
              criminal case would lead to "oppression and
              prejudice" or "extreme injustice" for the accused.
</blockquote>


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">Crl. M.C. No.1165/2019                                        Page 5 of 7</span>
<blockquote id="blockquote_8">               (vii). The considerations which would weigh with
              Court include the antecedents of the accused,
              possible lack of bona fides, his past conduct and
              that includes the question as to whether he had
              earlier absconded and as to how he had managed
              with the complainant to enter into a compromise.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_9">              (viii). But, the High Court, when called upon to
              exercise the power under Section 482 Cr. PC to
              bring the criminal case to an end on the basis of
              settlement, must steer clear of intervention in
              "heinous" or "serious" offences, including those
              involving "mental depravity", as indeed
              "economic offences" affecting "the financial and
              economic well being of the State", such as murder,
              attempt to murder, extortion, forgery, rape,
              dacoity, financial or economic frauds, cases under
              <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_16">Arms Act</a>, etc., the reason being that such offences
              are "not private in nature" but have "a serious
              impact upon society", and continuation of trial
              thereof is essential due to "overriding element of
              public interest".
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_10">              (ix). The court, however, is not to go by mere use of
              label of a serious offence (e.g. offence under
              <a href="/doc/455468/" id="a_17">Section 307</a> IPC), it being open to it to examine, by
              scrutiny of the evidence gathered, to find as to
              whether there are sufficient grounds to frame
              charge for such offence and, in this view, it being
              "not permissible" to intervene till the matter has
              been properly investigated."
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_11">10.     In a case where criminal proceedings arise essentially out of
matrimonial dispute and the parties have decided to bury the hatchet,


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">Crl. M.C. No.1165/2019                                       Page 6 of 7</span>
 the court must examine if there is any likelihood of the criminal
prosecution resulting in conviction. In fact-situation wherein the
matrimonial relation has been brought to an end by mutual consent
and the parties are eager to move on with their respective lives seeking
closure and if there is nothing to indicate lack of bonafide on the part
of any side, denial of the prayer for quashing the criminal case would
restore acrimony rather than bring about peace. Allowing continuance
of the criminal action would be fruitless and clearly an abuse of
judicial process.
