           "gali sare-e-aam" and the plaintiffs have every right to use it but their such

           right to use it has been threatened by the defendants/respondents, who are

           appellants approached learned trial Court for a decree of permanent

           injunction to restrain the defendants/respondents from encroaching upon the

           suit property stated to be a "gali sare-e-aam" shown by letters ABCDEFG in

           red colour in the site plan attached with the plaint.

</p><p id="p_4">                               The suit was contested by filing written statements. Issues

           were framed. Parties adduced evidence. Learned trial Court, on appraisal

           of evidence in the light of submissions made at the bar, found that the

           appellants were not able to prove the property in question to be a "gali sare-

           e-aam" and their right to use it. Accordingly, it dismissed the appellants'

           suit.

<p id="p_5">                               Findings recorded by the learned trial Court have been affirmed

           by the learned first appellate Court by dismissing appellants' appeal (Civil

           Appeal No. 253 of 2011/2012).
</p>
<p id="p_6">                               It also comes out from the record that there is no evidence,

           whatsoever, to show that the property in question is a "gali sare-e-aam" and

           any of the doors of the house of the appellants opens towards that "gali". So

           been found to be unbelievable because appellant No.1 -Prem Raj has

           himself admitted while appearing as PW-1 before the learned trial Court that

           this site plan was prepared in tehsil complex when he accompanied by Kela

           Devi and Krishan went to that place for getting the site plan prepared and

           that it was not prepared on the spot. Further, it has also been found by the

           learned Courts below that Kela Devi, a co-plaintiff of the appellants, had

           earlier filed a suit titled "Kela Devi Vs. Rajinder" which was decreed and in
