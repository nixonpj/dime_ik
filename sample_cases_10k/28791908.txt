12-05-2017

        Smt. Nirmala Nayak, counsel for the petitioner.
        Shri Sanjay Lal, counsel for the respondent on advance</pre>
<p id="p_1">copy.
</p><p id="p_2">      Heard on I.A. No.3167/2017, an application for
condonation of delay.
</p><p id="p_3">      Counsel for the respondent/revenue has no objection.
      For the reasons mentioned in the application, the same is
allowed and the delay in filing the application is hereby
condoned.
</p><p id="p_4">      Also heard on admission.
</p><p id="p_5">      This review petition has been filed for review of the order
dated 8.7.2016 passed in ITA No.15/2016.
</p><p id="p_6">      After hearing the counsel, we have answered the substantial
questions of law No.1 to 5 framed by the Court.
</p><p id="p_7">      It is submitted by the counsel for the review petitioner that
another application/IA was filed in the case and another
substantial question of law No.6 was proposed and that fact has
not been considered by the Court.
</p><p id="p_8">      Counsel for the respondent-revenue has submitted that
while arguing finally, the counsel for the review petitioner did
not point out the fact that another IA is pending in which
additional substantial question of law was proposed.
</p><p id="p_9">      It is apparent that the aforesaid fact was not brought to the
notice of the Court that an application for proposing another
substantial question of law was pending. Apart from this by the
 aforesaid application, the review petitioner wanted to frame
following substantial questions of law:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">            "6. Whether the order passed by tribunal is perverse
     in as much as it has been passed by relying on Section 132
     (4A) whereas book BF-30 was found during the course of
     survey and not during the course of search and further that it
     was not found from possession of appellant, but from some
     other concern."</blockquote>
<p id="p_10">      In our opinion, it is not necessary to formulate the aforesaid
substantial question of law because the fact mentioned in the
substantial question of law is pure question of fact and the same
have been considered by the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal.
Apart from this, we have considered the merits of the case. There
is no error apparent on the face of record hence, we do not find
any merit in this review petition.
</p><p id="p_11">      It is hereby dismissed.
</p>
