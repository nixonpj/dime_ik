JUDGMENT AND AWARD DATED: 8.7.2008 PASSED IN
MVC NO. 39/2007 ON THE FILE OF THE CIVIL JUDGE
(SR.DN) AND MACT, TARIKERE, PARTLY ALLOWING THE
CLAIM PETITION FOR COMPENSATION AND SEEKING
ENHANCEMENT OF COMPENSATION.

     THIS APPEAL COMING ON FOR ORDERS THIS DAY,
THE COURT DELIVERED THE FOLLOWING:-

                     JUDGMENT
</pre>

<p id="p_1">     This    appeal    is   by   the   claimant   seeking

enhancement     of    compensation     awarded    by   the

Tribunal.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">     2.     Heard, the appeal is admitted and with the

consent of learned counsel appearing for parties, it is

taken up for final disposal.
</p>
<p id="p_4">
</p><p id="p_5">     3.     For the sake of convenience, the parties are

referred to as they are referred to in the claim petition

before the Tribunal.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                              3</span><p id="p_6">



</p><p id="p_7">     4.    As there is no dispute regarding injuries

sustained by the claimant in a road traffic accident

occurred on 22.3.2007 due to rash and negligent

driving of the offending bus bearing registration

No.KA-17-8999 by its driver and liability of the

insurer of the offending vehicle, the only point that

arises for my consideration in the appeal is:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">           "Whether quantum of compensation
     awarded by the Tribunal is just and
     reasonable     or     does        it     call    for
     enhancement?"</blockquote><p id="p_8">


</p><p id="p_9">     5.    After   hearing       the        learned   counsel

appearing for parties and perusing the judgment and

award of the Tribunal, I am of the view that the

compensation awarded by the Tribunal is not just and

reasonable, it is on the lower side and hence it is

required to be enhanced.
</p>
<p id="p_10">
</p><p id="p_11">     6.    As per wound certificate Ex.P-25, the

claimant has sustained following injuries:-
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                  4</span>


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">      a)        Incised wound on the right side of the
                forehead measuring 1x1 cm
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">      b)        Fracture on the right knee joint and x-ray
                discloses that he sustained fracture of
                lateral condyle of right femur.</blockquote><p id="p_12">

</p><p id="p_13">      The injuries sustained by the claimant are also

evident from medical certificate Ex.P-26 &amp; 27 and

supported by oral evidence of the claimant and

doctor,    who        were    examined   as   PWs-5    and   7

respectively. PW-7, doctor in his evidence has stated

that the claimant has suffered disability of 40% to the

limb and 20%-25% to the whole body.
</p>
<p id="p_14">
</p><p id="p_15">      7.        Considering the nature of injuries, a sum

of   Rs.30,000/-         is   awarded    towards   'pain   and

suffering' as against Rs.25,000/- awarded by the

Tribunal.
</p>
<p id="p_16">
</p><p id="p_17">      8.        The claimant has produced medical bills

for Rs.10,860/-. He was treated as inpatient for a

period     of     7    days     in   Ramakrishna      Hospital,

Davanangere. Considering the nature of injuries and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                           5</span>


duration of treatment, a sum of Rs.15,000/- is

awarded towards 'medical and incidental expenses' as

against Rs.6,000/- awarded by the Tribunal.


</p><p id="p_18">     10.   The claimant claims to be working as a bus

agent and agriculturist and earning a sum of

Rs.10,000/-   per   month,    but   the   same   is   not

established by producing any documents. In the

absence of proof of income, considering his age as 42

years and year of accident as 2007, his income could

be assessed at Rs.4,000/- per month as against

Rs.3,000/- per month assessed by the Tribunal. The

nature of injuries suggest that he must have been

under rest and treatment for a period of 4 months

and therefore a sum of Rs.16,000/- is awarded

towards 'loss of income during laid up period' as

against Rs.9,000/- awarded by the Tribunal.


</p><p id="p_19">     11.   Considering the disability stated by the

doctor and an amount of discomfort and unhappiness
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                            6</span>


the claimant has to undergo in his future life, a sum

of Rs.20,000/- is awarded towards 'loss of amenities'

as against Rs.5,000/- awarded by the Tribunal.


</p><p id="p_20">     12.   The claimant is aged about 42 years at the

time of accident, and the multiplier applicable to his

age group is 14. His income is assessed at Rs.4,000/-

per month. PW-2, doctor in his evidence has stated

that claimant has suffered disability of 40% to the

lower limb and 20 to 25% to the whole body.

Considering the nature of injuries, the functional

disability is assessed at 15%. Therefore, the 'loss of

future income' works out to Rs.1,00,800/- (4000 x 12

x 14 x 15/100) and it is awarded as against

Rs.10,000/- awarded by the Tribunal.


</p><p id="p_21">     13.   Thus, the claimant is entitled for the

following compensation:-
</p>
<pre id="pre_2">             HEADS                      Rs.
  Pain and sufferings                    30,000
  Medical     and     incidental         15,000
  expenses
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                              7</span>


  Loss of income during laid up               16,000
  period
  Loss of amenities                           20,000
  Loss of future income                     1,00,800
              TOTAL                       1,81,800
  LESS: Compensation awarded                  55,000
  by the Tribunal
             BALANCE                      1,26,800


</pre><p id="p_22">     14.   Accordingly, the appeal is allowed-in-part.

The judgment and award passed by the Tribunal is

modified to the extent stated herein above. The

claimant is entitled for an additional compensation of

Rs.1,26,800/- with interest at 6% p.a. from the

date of claim petition till the date of realisation.


</p><p id="p_23">     15.   The Insurance Company is directed to

deposit the additional compensation amount together

with interest within two months from the date of

receipt of a copy of this judgment. From which,

Rs.1,00,00/- with proportionate interest is ordered to

be invested in fixed deposit in the name of claimant in

any Nationalised Bank/Scheduled Bank/Post Office
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                              8</span>


for a period of 6 years and with a right of option to

withdraw interest periodically.    Remaining amount

with proportionate interest is ordered to be released in

favour of the claimant.
</p>
<p id="p_24">
</p><p id="p_25">     16.   The Tribunal while releasing 25% of the

amount is also directed to issue the fixed deposit

slips, so as to enable the claimant to withdraw the

deposit amount on its maturity without approaching

the Tribunal once again and the Bank is directed to

release the fixed deposit amount without insisting for

any further order from the Tribunal.


</p><p id="p_26">     No order as to costs.
</p>
<p id="p_27">


</p><p id="p_28">                                   Sd/-
