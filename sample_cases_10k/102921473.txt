ORAL JUDGMENT</pre>
 


 


 


<p id="p_1">[1]	
	This petition is directed against the order of detention dated
20.1.2012
passed by respondent
No.2, in exercise of powers
conferred under Section 3(1) of the Gujarat Prevention of Anti Social
Activities Act, 1985 (in short  the Act) by detaining the detenu as
a  bootlegger  as
defined under Section 2(b) of the Act. Along
with the order of detention, the petitioner is also served with the
grounds of detention. In the grounds of detention, there is a
reference to the  criminal cases  pending against the petitioner. The
cases are  registered under the provisions of the Bombay Prohibition
Act. It is alleged that the petitioner is dealing in country liquor. 
</p>

 


 


 


<p id="p_2">[2]		Learned
advocate for the detenu submits that registration of FIR itself
cannot lead to disturbance of even tempo of public life and therefore
the public order. The order of detention is assailed by the
detenu on various grounds mentioned in the memo of the petition.
However, learned counsel for the detenu submits that, except FIRs
registered under the Bombay Prohibition Act, there was no other
material before the detaining authority whereby it could be inferred
reasonably that the detenu is a 'bootlegger' within the meaning of
Section 2(b) of the Act and required to be detained as the detenu's
activities are prejudicial to the maintenance of  public health and
public order. In support of the  above submission, learned counsel
for the detenu has placed reliance on judgment of the  Apex Court in
the case of <a href="/doc/575391/" id="a_1">Piyush Kantilal Mehta vs.
Commissioner</a> of police, AIR 1989 Supreme Court 491 and the
recent judgment dated 28.3.2011 passed by the Division Bench of this 
Court [Coram: S.J. Mukhopadhaya C.J. &amp; J.B. Pardiwala, J].]
in Letters Patent Appeal No.2732 of
2010  in Special Civil Application No.9492 of 2010 (<a href="/doc/1863195/" id="a_2">Aartiben vs.
Commissioner of Police</a>) which
would squarely help the detenu. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_3">[3]		Learned
Assistant Government Pleader submitted that registration of FIRs
would go to show that the detenu had, in fact, indulged into such
activities, which can be said to be disturbing the public health and
public order and in view of sufficient material before the detaining
authority to pass the order of detention, no interference
is called for by this Court in exercise of its power under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_3">Article
226</a> of the Constitution of India.  
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_4">[4]		Having
heard the rival submissions of the parties and perused the record of
the case, I am of the view that FIRs registered under the Bombay
Prohibition Act alone cannot be said to be sufficient enough to
arrive at subjective satisfaction to the effect that the activities,
as alleged, are prejudicial to the public order or lead to
disturbance of public order. There has to be nexus and link for such
activities with disturbance of the public order. On careful perusal
of the material available on record and the ratio laid down by the
Apex Court in the case of Piyush
Kantilal Mehta (supra) and the
recent judgment dated 28.3.2011 passed by the Division Bench of this 
Court [Coram: S.J. Mukhopadhaya C.J. &amp; J.B. Pardiwala, J].] in
Letters Patent Appeal No.2732 of 2010  in Special Civil Application
No.9492 of 2010 (<a href="/doc/1863195/" id="a_4">Aartiben vs. Commissioner of Police</a>),
I am of the view that the activities of the detenu cannot be said to
be in any manner prejudicial to the public order and therefore, the
order of detention  passed by the detaining authority cannot be
sustained and is required to be quashed and set aside.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_5">[5]		In
the result, this Special Civil Application is allowed. The impugned
order of detention dated 20.1.2012 passed by respondent No. 2 is
hereby quashed and set aside. The detenu is ordered to be set at
liberty forthwith if not required in any other case. Rule is made
absolute accordingly. Direct service is permitted.
</p>
