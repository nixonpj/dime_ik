<p id="p_1">      The petitioners have filed the present petition praying for a
direction to respondent No.2 to constitute the committee as per the

</p><p id="p_2">      Brief facts of the case are that the petitioners are carrying on
business in the name of Bainganga Rice Mill, Patel Timber and Patel
Poha in the Balaghat District. A dispute arose between the petitioners
and the respondents on account of non supply of paddy in time and
supply of interior quality, therefore, the petitioners made a complaint
against them to the various authority. The Government of India,
Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution,
Department of Food and Public Distribution vide letter dated
06/01/2017 has directed the Principal Secretary/respondent No.1 to
dissolve the dispute regarding payment of paddy of the petitioners. In
pursuance to the direction issued by the Central Government, the SDO
has made an enquiry and referred the matter to the Collector for
appointment of a High Level Audit Team on 16/03/2017, however
inspite of the report submitted by the SDO on 16/03/2017 no such
team has been constituted by the Collector. He, therefore, prays that an
appropriate direction may be issued to constitute the High Level Audit
Team in the matter.
</p><p id="p_3">       Learned Panel Lawyer appearing on behalf of the State, on
advance copy, does not oppose the prayer of the petitioner and submits
that suitable action shall be taken in the matter.
</p><p id="p_4">       In view of the submissions made by learned counsel for the
parties, the petition filed by the petitioners is disposed of with a
direction to respondent No.2 to constitute the High Level Audit Team
as expeditiously as possible preferably within a period of one month
from the date of receipt of certified copy of the order passed today.
</p><p id="p_5">      The petitioner is at liberty to file an application for stay before
the Collector and on filing such application, Collector will consider the
same in accordance with law. The expenses of the High Level Audit
Team will be bear by the petitioner. High Level Audit Team shall
decide the matter within a period of four months. It is made clear that
this Court has not expressed any opinion on the merits of the case.
</p><p id="p_6">      With the aforesaid observation, the petition stands disposed of,
