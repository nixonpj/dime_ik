           and decree dated 23.10.1981 (Annexure P-1), suit of Smt. Mohinder

           Kaur was decreed only for declaration to the effect that she was

           by way of any further appeal. Petitioners in the present civil revision

           did not file any appeal, because they were not feeling aggrieved by

           decree dated 23.10.1981 (Annexure P-1). However, on the basis of

           decreed vide decree dated 29.1.1985. Thereafter, Smt.              Mohinder

           Kaur filed application dated 7.4.1985 under Section 152 (of the Code

           of Civil Procedure ('CPC' for short) Annexure P-3), seeking

           the above said civil suit No. 548 of 15.9.1978.            No notice of this

           by the learned trial court, vide order dated 2.6.1986 (Annexure P-2).

           757, which was numbered as such in lieu of khewat and Khasra

           No.261/268, was also included in the decree. Jaswant Singh and

           others-petitioners in the civil revision filed an application for setting

           aside the ex parte order dated 2.6.1986 whereby the application of

           Smt. Mohinder Kaur for amendment, was allowed.                 However, this

           Singh filed the regular second appeal. The appeal was admitted and

           the civil revision as well as the regular second appeal were ordered

           to be heard together. That is how, this Court is seized of the matter.

</p><p id="p_11">                               Learned counsel for the petitioners-Jaswant Singh and

           others in the civil revision as well as for Iqbal Singh in the regular

           second appeal, submits that the learned trial court exceeded its

           jurisdiction while passing the impugned order dated 2.6.1986

           (Annexure P-2). The learned trial court also fell into serious error of

           law, while passing the impugned order dated 24.9.1986, while not

           setting aside the ex parte order dated 2.6.1986. He further submits

           that so far as the original decree dated 23.10.1981 (Annexure P-1)

           was concerned, the petitioners and the appellant were not aggrieved

           against the same, because Smt. Mohinder Kaur was declared to

           have no right in old khewat and khasra No. 261/268 in lieu of which

           new khasra No. 757 came to be allotted.              Since they were not

           aggrieved, they did not challenge the original decree dated

           23.10.1981.            However, passing of the impugned order dated

           2.6.1986, thereby amending the decree and including khasra No. 757

           therein, was wholly without jurisdiction, because this order was

           passed even without issuing notice to the petitioners-Jaswant Singh

           and others. When this fact was brought to the notice of the learned

           trial court by moving an application seeking setting aside the ex parte

           order dated 2.6.1986, even this application was also dismissed by

           the learned trial court, vide order dated 24.9.1986.             He next

           contended that since the impugned judgment in the regular second

           appeal is based on the impugned order dated 2.6.1986, the same

           was also not sustainable in law.           To substantiate his arguments,

           learned counsel for the petitioners relies upon two judgments in

           Kanda and others Vs. Waghu, AIR (37) 1950 Privy Council, 68

           and Union of India Vs. Smt. Pratap Kaur (dead) through LRs and

           another, JT 1995 (2) SC 569. Finally, he prays for setting aside the

           orders dated 2.6.1986 as well as 24.9.1986 impugned in the civil

           revision and also the judgment dated 15.10.1986 passed by the

           learned lower appellate court impugned in the regular second appeal,

           by allowing the appeal as well as civil revision.

</p><p id="p_12">                               Per contra, learned counsel for the respondent submits

           that petitioners in the civil revision as well as appellants in the regular

           second appeal were duly served in the suit filed by Smt. Mohinder

           Kaur, but they did not contest the same. Consequently, the judgment

           rightly did not issue any notice to them before passing the order

           dated 2.6.1986 (Annexure P-2). On the similar lines, he contended

           that the learned trial court did not commit any error of law while

                                    Ltd. v. State of Orissa</a> (AIR 1966 SC 1047) it was

                                    observed that the arithmetical mistake is a mistake

                                    of calculation, a clerical mistake is a mistake in

                                    writing or typing whereas an error arising out of or

                                    occurring from accidental slip or omission is an

                                    error due to careless mistake on the part of the

                                    Court liable to be corrected. To illustrate this point it

                                    was said that in a case where the order contains

                                    something which is not mentioned in the decree, it

                                    would be a case of unintentional omission or

                                    mistake as the mistake or omission is attributable to

                                    the Court which may say something or omit to say

                                    something which it did not intend to say or omit. No

                                    new arguments or re-arguments on merits can be

                                    entertained    to   facilitate   such   rectification   of

                                    mistakes. The provision cannot be invoked to

                                    modify, alter or add to the terms of the original order

                                    or decree so as to, in effect, pass an effective

                                    judicial order after the judgment in the case.

           feeling aggrieved against the original decree dated 23.10.1981.

           There was a strong reason that they did not contest the suit. The

           land in their ownership and possession comprising in khasra No. 757

           was not included in the plaint and remained untouched in the original

           decree dated 23.10.1981. However, in spite of the fact that plaintiff-

           respondent namely Smt. Mohinder Kaur moved application for

           amendment in the decree, seeking inclusion of the land in khasra No.

           757, which was certainly going to adversely affect the rights of

           Jaswant Singh etc., still the learned trial court did not issue any

           notice to them. It was the mandatory requirement of law that learned

           trial court ought to have issued notice to the would be affected

           parties. However, it was not so done in the instant case thereby

           violating the basic principle of Audi Alteram Partem.

           law, framed hereinabove, it is held that impugned orders dated

           2.6.1986 passed by the learned trial court amending the decree to

           the detriment of the petitioners and that too even without putting

           them to notice, was patently illegal and against the principles of

           natural justice, besides being violative of the doctrine of Audi Alteram

           Partem, therefore, cannot be sustained.

</p><p id="p_46">                               No other argument was raised

                               Considering the peculiar facts and circumstances of the

           case noted above, coupled with the reasons aforementioned, this

           Court is of the considered view that the order dated 2.6.1986 and the

           order dated 24.9.1986, under challenge in the revision petition,

           cannot be sustained. On the same analogy and for same reasons,

           the judgment dated 15.10.1986              passed by the learned Additional

           Sessions Judge, Faridkot, under challenge in the regular second

           15.10.1986 impugned in the regular second appeal are hereby set

           costs.
