          THE HON' BLE SRI JUSTICE T.AMARNATH GOUD

                      M.A.C.M.A. No. 211 of 2014


JUDGMENT:
</pre>

<p id="p_1">      This appeal is arising out of the judgment dated 10.05.2010 in

M.V.O.P No.480 of 2007, on the file of the Motor Accidents Claims

Tribunal-cum-I-Additional District Judge at Medak, Sangareddy.


</p><p id="p_2">2.    The appellants are claimants who have filed a claim petition under

<a href="/doc/136948773/" id="a_1">Section 166</a> of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, claiming a compensation of

Rs.3,50,000/- against the respondents 1 and 2.         The Tribunal, on

consideration of the evidence, has partly allowed the claim petition

awarding compensation of Rs.2,84,000/- against the respondent No.1-the

Depot Manager, TSRTC, Zaheerabad depot and the respondent No.2 -

the Managing Director, TSRTC, Musheerabad.


</p><p id="p_3">3.    The appellants-claim petitioners, aggrieved by the judgment

passed by the Tribunal, awarding compensation of Rs.2,84,000/-, have

preferred this appeal for claiming a compensation of Rs.3,50,000/-.


</p><p id="p_4">4.    As per the averments of the petition, the petitioners are the wife

and major sons of the deceased. The deceased traveled in an auto from

Budhera to Chinta Village and when the auto reached the limits of

Kamkole village on NH9, then a bus bearing No.AP 11 Z 2114 came from

opposite direction in a rash and negligent manner in high speed and

dashed auto, due to which the auto fell down and all the passengers

including the deceased died on the spot.
</p>
<p id="p_5">
</p><p id="p_6">5.    The petitioners are the wife and major sons of the deceased. The

deceased, who died in the accident was doing Goldsmith business.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                        2</span>



</p><p id="p_7">6.        As against the claim of compensation of Rs.3,50,000/- by the

appellants,       the Court below awarded a compensation of Rs.2,84,000/-

with interest @ 8% per annum from the date of petition till the date of

deposit.
</p>
<p id="p_8">
</p><p id="p_9">7.        The learned counsel for the appellants states that the appellants

are entitled for enhancement of compensation in the light of the judgment

of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/139996215/" id="a_2">National Insurance Company Limited

v. Pranay Sethi1</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_10">
</p><p id="p_11">8.        Heard the arguments of learned counsel for the appellants, and the

learned counsel for the respondents.
</p>
<p id="p_12">
</p><p id="p_13">9.        The order passed by the Tribunal is considered and insofar the

issue of conventional heads, namely, loss of estate, loss of consortium

and funeral expenses is concerned it is apt to refer to the recent decision

of the Apex Court in National Insurance Co.Ltd. v Pranay Sethi and

others, wherein, it was held as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_14">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">                 "Reasonable figures on conventional heads,
             namely, loss of estate, loss of consortium and
             funeral expenses should be Rs.15,000/- Rs.40,000/-
             and Rs.15,000/- respectively.      The aforesaid
             amounts should be enhanced at the rate of 10% in
             every three years"
</blockquote>

<p id="p_15">10.       Taking into consideration the aforementioned decision of the Apex

Court, this Court is inclined to grant Rs.40,000/- to the 1st appellant (wife

of the deceased) towards loss of consortium, Rs.15,000/- to the appellant

towards loss of estate and another Rs.15,000/- towards funeral expenses.

</p><p id="p_20">3.        1) towards loss of consortium      Rs.40,000/-   Rs. 70,000/-

          Total compensation awarded                       Rs. 3,44,000/-
</blockquote>


<p id="p_21">11.      Thus, the appellants are entitled for a total compensation of

Rs.3,44,000/- as against the compensation of         Rs.2,84,000/- which

was awarded by the Tribunal.
</p>
<p id="p_22">
</p><p id="p_23">12.      In the result, the appeal is party allowed, enhancing the award

passed by the Court below from Rs. 2,84,000/- to Rs.3,44,000/- with

interest at 8% per annum from the date of petition till realization. The

remaining part of the judgment remained unchanged.
