                     AT CHANDIGARH.

                            Crl. Misc. No. M-6420 of 2012 (O&amp;M)
                            Date of Decision: 23.1.2013.

SABINA, J.
</pre>

<p id="p_1">             Petitioners have filed this petition under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_1">Section 482</a>

of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 for quashing of the FIR

No. 69 dated 13.10.2011, under <a href="/doc/988620/" id="a_2">Section 406</a>, <a href="/doc/538436/" id="a_3">498-A</a> of the Indian

Penal Code ('<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_4">IPC</a>' for short), registered at Police Station Muktsar

Sadar, District Sri Muktsar Sahib (Annexure P-1) and all the

subsequent proceedings arising therefrom in view of compromise

dated 9.2.2012 (Annexure P-2) arrived at between the parties.

</p><p id="p_2">             Learned counsel for the petitioners as well as learned

counsel for respondent No. 2 have submitted that now the

parties have amicably settled their dispute

             Vide order dated 22.11.2012, parties were directed to

appear before the Trial Court and the Trial Court was directed to

record the statements of the parties and send its report qua the

validity of the compromise effected between the parties.

</p><p id="p_3">             In pursuance to the said order, Trial Court has

<p id="p_4">recorded the statements of the parties and has reported that the

compromise effected between the parties was genuine.

</p><p id="p_5">             As per the Full Bench judgment of this Court in

<a href="/doc/811682/" id="a_5">Kulwinder Singh and others vs. State of Punjab</a>, 2007 (3)

RCR (Criminal) 1052, High Court has power under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_6">Section 482</a>

Cr.P.C. to allow the compounding of non-compoundable offence

and quash the prosecution where the High Court felt that the

same was required to prevent the abuse of the process of any

Court or to otherwise secure the ends of justice. This power of

quashing is not confined to matrimonial disputes alone.

</p><p id="p_6">             Hon'ble the Apex Court in the case of <a href="/doc/393489/" id="a_7">Nikhil

Merchant vs. Central Bureau of Investigation and another JT</a>

2008 (9) SC 192 in para Nos. 23 and 24 has held as under:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">             "23. In the instant case, the disputes between the

             Company and the Bank have been set at rest on the

             basis   of   the    compromise   arrived   at    by   them

             whereunder the dues of the Bank have been cleared

             and the Bank does not appear to have any further

             claim against the Company. What, however, remains

             is the fact that certain documents were alleged to

             have been created by the appellant herein in order to

             avail of credit facilities beyond the limit to which the

             Company was entitled. The dispute involved herein

             has overtones of a civil dispute with certain criminal

             facets. The question which is required to be answered

             in this case is whether the power which independently

             lies    with this court     to   quash     the    criminal

             proceedings pursuant to the compromise arrived at,
 Crl. Misc. No. M-6420 of 2012 (O&amp;M)                               -3 -
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">             should at all be exercised?
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">             24.On an overall view of the facts as indicated

               hereinabove and keeping     in mind the decision of

               this Court in B.S.Joshi's case (supra) and the

               compromise arrived at between the Company and

               the Bank as also clause 11 of the consent terms

               filed in the suit filled by the Bank, we are satisfied

               that this is a fit case where technicality should not

               be allowed to stand in the way in the quashing of

               the criminal proceedings, since, in our view, the

               continuance of the same after the compromise

               arrived at between the parties would be a futile

               exercise."</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">             In case of Shiji @ Pappu and others Vs. Radhika

and another 2012 (1) R.C.R. (Criminal) 9, the Hon'ble Apex

Court in para No.13 has held as under:-
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">             13.    It is manifest that simply because an offence is

             not compoundable under <a href="/doc/895891/" id="a_8">Section 320</a> IPC is by itself

             no reason for the High Court to refuse exercise of its

             power under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_9">Section 482</a> Cr.P.C. That power can in

             our opinion be exercised in cases where there is no

             chance of recording a conviction against the accused

             and the entire exercise of a trial is destined to be an

             exercise in futility. There is a subtle distinction

             between compounding of offences by the parties

             before the trial Court or in appeal on one hand and

             the exercise of power by the High Court to quash the

             prosecution under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_10">Section 482</a> Cr.P.C. On the other.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_7"> Crl. Misc. No. M-6420 of 2012 (O&amp;M)                                -4 -

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_8">             While a Court trying an accused or hearing an appeal

             against conviction, may not be competent to permit

             compounding of an offence based on a settlement

             arrived at between the parties in cases where the

             offences are not compoundable under <a href="/doc/91933/" id="a_11">Section 320</a>,

             the High Court may quash the prosecution even in

             cases where the offences with which the accused

             stand charged are non-compoundable. The inherent

             powers of the High Court under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_12">Section 482</a> Cr.P.C.

             are not for that purpose controlled by <a href="/doc/91933/" id="a_13">Section 320</a>

             Cr.P.C. Having said so, we must hasten to add that

             the plenitude of the power under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_14">Section 482</a> Cr.P.C.</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_9">

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_10">             by itself, makes it obligatory for the High Court to

             exercise the same with utmost care and caution. The

             width and the nature of the power itself demands that

             its exercise is sparing and only in cases where the

             High Court is, for reasons to be recorded, of the clear

             view that continuance of the prosecution would be

             nothing but an abuse of the process of law. It is

             neither necessary nor proper for us to enumerate the

             situations in which the exercise of power under

             <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_15">Section 482</a> may be justified. All that we need to say

             is that the exercise of power must be for securing the

             ends of justice and only in cases where refusal to

             exercise that power may result in the abuse of the

             process of law. The High court may be justified in

             declining interference if it is called upon to appreciate

             evidence for it cannot assume the role of an appellate
