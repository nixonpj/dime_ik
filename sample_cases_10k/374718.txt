CORAM:        HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE T.S.THAKUR, CHIEF JUSTICE
              HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE JASBIR SINGH



PRESENT: Mr. Ravi Kant Sharma,
         Advocate, for the petitioner.


JASBIR SINGH, J.
</pre>


<p id="p_1">JUDGMENT.
</p>
<p id="p_2">              Appellant by filing this Letters Patent Appeal has laid

challenge to the judgment, passed by the learned Single Bench on August 1,

2008, vide which Civil Writ Petition No. 10720 of 2002, filed by respondent

No.2, was partly allowed. By that order the award dated November 9, 2001,

passed by respondent No. 1 setting aside retrenchment and ordering re-

instatement of the appellant in service with 50% back wages was partially

modified. The appellant in lieu of re-instatement was held entitled to get

compensation of Rs. 35,000/-.
</p>
<p id="p_3">              It is contention of counsel for the appellant that the learned
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1"> LETTERS PATENT APPEAL NO. 272 OF 2008                                  -2-</span>

Single Bench was not justified in declining relief of re-instatement in

service to the appellant. To support his contention, he stated that the service

of the appellant was terminated without complying with the provisions of

<a href="/doc/1056316/" id="a_1">Section 25-F</a> of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 (for short the Act), as

such, appellant's termination was not justified. Once it was so, re-

instatement in service was the natural consequence, as was ordered by

respondent No. 1. The learned Single Bench has erred in upsetting the order

of re-instatement, passed in favour of the appellant. In the alternative, he

argued that amount of compensation awarded, in lieu of re-instatement, was

on the lower side. He prayed that this appeal be allowed, the impugned

order be set aside and order dated November 9, 2001, passed by respondent

No. 1, be restored.
</p>
<p id="p_4">            As per admitted facts on record, appellant joined service as

Clerk, on contract basis, with respondent No. 2 on February 10, 1995,

against a fixed monthly salary. Her service was terminated on August 1,

1997. It is also not disputed before us that when terminating the service of

the appellant, neither retrenchment notice was served nor retrenchment

compensation was paid to her.
</p>
<p id="p_5">            Appellant raised an industrial dispute, which was referred to the

Labour Court on May 14, 1998, for adjudication under <a href="/doc/1218044/" id="a_2">Section 10(1)(c)</a> of

the Act. It has come on record that the appellant was not selected through

regular process of selection. Respondent No. 1 came to the conclusion that

before terminating service of the appellant, respondent No. 2 has failed to

comply with the provisions of <a href="/doc/1056316/" id="a_3">Section 25-F</a> of the Act. In view of above

said fact, appellant was ordered to be re-instated, with continuity in service

and on payment of 50% of the back wages. Against that award, respondent
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2"> LETTERS PATENT APPEAL NO. 272 OF 2008                                -3-</span>

No. 2 came to this Court. The learned Single Bench, vide the impugned

judgment, affirmed the finding of respondent No. 1 to the extent that there

was non-compliance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/1056316/" id="a_4">Section 25-F</a> of the Act.

However, relief of re-instatement was declined by observing as under:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">               "Taking into consideration the totality of the facts that the

               workman's appointment was a contractual appointment

               although completed 240 days, coupled with the guidelines

               laid down by this Court in Civil Writ Petition No. 3827 of

               1997 (supra), it would not be appropriate to order the re-

               instatement of the respondent / workman in view of

               judgment in <a href="/doc/1724561/" id="a_5">Madhya Pradesh Administration vs Tribhuvan</a>,

               2008(1) S.C. L&amp;S 264. Accordingly, the impugned award

               dated 09-11-2001 passed by the Labour Court, Amritsar, is

               modified and to meet the ends of justice, I direct the

               petitioner - Management to pay compensation to the tune of

               Rs. 35,000/- to the workman, as admittedly the workman was

               being paid his last drawn wages, as per <a href="/doc/770112/" id="a_6">Section 17-B</a> of the

               Act."
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">

            We are of the view that the order declining relief of re-

</blockquote><p id="p_6">instatement in service is perfectly justified. Their Lordships of the Supreme

Court in <a href="/doc/1655245/" id="a_7">U.P. SRTC v. Man Singh</a>, (2006)7 SCC 752, were also confronted

with a similar proposition, as to whether a workman, whose termination has

been set aside, would always be entitled to get re-instatement in service. It

was observed as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">            "The appellant is a statutory corporation. Keeping in view the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3"> LETTERS PATENT APPEAL NO. 272 OF 2008                              -4-</span>

        fact that the respondent was appointed on a temporary basis, it

        was unlikely that he remained unemployed for such a long time.

        In any event, it would be wholly unjust at this distance of time,

        i.e., after a period of more than 30 years, to direct reinstatement

        of the respondent in service. Unfortunately, the Labour Court

        or the High Court did not consider these aspects of the matter.

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">        8. Keeping in view the peculiar facts and circumstances of this

          case, we are of the opinion that instead and in place of the

          direction for reinstatement of the respondent together with

          back wages from 1986, interest of justice would be

          subserved if the appellant is directed to pay a sum of Rs.

          50,000/- to him. Similar orders, we may place on record,

          have been passed by this Court in <a href="/doc/870157/" id="a_8">State of Rajasthan v.

          Ghyan Chand</a>, (2006)7SCC 755, <a href="/doc/571829/" id="a_9">State of M.P. v. Arjunlal

          Rajak</a>, (2006) 2 SCC 711: 2006 SCC (L&amp;S) 429, Nagar

          SCC 434: 2006 SCC (L&amp;S) 1830: AIR 2006 SC 2427.

          It was further held:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">          "The legal position has since undergone a change in the light

          of a Constitution Bench decision of this Court in <a href="/doc/179794777/" id="a_12">Secy, State

          of Karnataka v. Umadevi</a>(3), (2006) 4 SCC 1: 2006 SCC

          (L&amp;S)753, wherein this Court held that 'State' within the

          meaning of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_13">Article 12</a> of the Constitution of India is under a

          constitutional obligation to comply with the provisions
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4"> LETTERS PATENT APPEAL NO. 272 OF 2008                                 -5-</span>

              contained in Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India."</blockquote><p id="p_7">



</p><p id="p_8">            The ratio of the judgment in Man Singh's case (supra) was

again reiterated by their lordships of the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/792374/" id="a_14">Madhya Pradesh

Administration v. Tribhuban</a>, (2007) 9 Supreme Court Cases 748, in which

relief of re-instatement was declined to a workman and in lieu thereof an

amount of Rs. 75,000/- was ordered to be paid by way of compensation.

Similar question as to whether workman was entitled to re-instatement in

service, as ordered by the Labour Court, came up for consideration before

their lordships of the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/1708604/" id="a_15">Sita Ram and others v. Moti Lal

Nehru Farmers Training Institute</a>, (2008) 5 Supreme Court Cases 75,

wherein it was observed as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">            "23. Indisputably, the Industrial Court, exercises a discretionary

            jurisdiction, but such discretion is required to be exercised

            judiciously. Relevant factors therefor were required to be taken

            into consideration, the nature of appointment, the period of

            appointment, the availability of the job, etc. should weight with

            the court for determination of such an issue.

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_7">            24.This Court in a large number of decisions opined that

              payment of adequate amount of compensation in place of a

              direction to be reinstated in service in cases of this nature

              would subserve the ends of justice. (See Jaipur Development

              Authority v. Ramsahai, (2006) 11 SCC 684: (2007) 1 SCC

              (L&amp;S) 518, M.P. Admn. v. Tribhuban, (2007) 9 SCC 748:

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_9">            25.Having regard to the facts and circumstances of this case,

               we are of the opinion that payment of a sum of Rs. 1,00,000/-

               to each of the appellants, would meet the ends of justice.

               This appeal is allowed to the aforementioned extent. In the

               facts and circumstances of this case, there shall be no order

               as to costs."</blockquote><p id="p_9">



</p><p id="p_10">            Similar is the situation in the present case. Admittedly, the

appellant was taken in service without complying with the statutory rules.

Her appointment was contractual in nature and she was being paid fixed

monthly salary. She had worked with respondent No. 2 for about two years

only. Under above said circumstances, we are of the opinion that her re-

instatement was not justified as has rightly been held by the learned Single

Bench. However, we find that the amount of compensation granted is

inadequate. In view of ratio of the judgments of the Hon'ble Supreme Court,

as referred to in the earlier part of this order, we enhance the amount of

compensation to Rs. 75,000/-.
</p>
<p id="p_11">            We are conscious of the fact that we are enhancing the

compensation without issuing notice to respondent No. 2. In case notice is

issued to respondent No. 2 at this stage, it will incur unnecessary delay and

expenses, which may be more than the amount of compensation enhanced

by us. This view of ours finds support from a Division Bench judgment of

this Court in C.W.P. No. 9563 of 2002 (Batala Machine Tools Workshop

Co-Op. Vs. Presiding Officer, Labour Court, Gurdaspur), rendered on June
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6"> LETTERS PATENT APPEAL NO. 272 OF 2008                               -7-</span>

27, 2002, in which it was held as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_10">            "We are conscious of the fact that the instant order is

            detrimental to the interest of the respondent- workman. We are

            also conscious of the fact that no notice has been given to the

            respondent - workman before the instant order has been passed.

            The reason for not issuing notice to the respondent - workman

            is to ensure that he does not have to incur unnecessary expenses

            in engaging counsel to appear on his behalf in this Court. The

            instant order by which the present petition is being disposed of

            fully protects the interest of the respondent -workman

            inasmuchas the amount determined by the Labour Court,

            Gurdaspur by its order dated 22.5.2002 has been required to be

            deposited by the petitioner - Management before the Labour
