REKHA MITTAL, J. (Oral)
</pre><p id="p_1">            The claimants are in appeal seeking enhancement of
compensation on account of death of Jatin Gilhotra in a motor vehicular
accident that took place on 03.01.2015.
</p><p id="p_2">            The Tribunal awarded Rs.5,57,000/-, detailed hereunder:-
</p><pre id="pre_2">            1. Monthly income of the deceased              Rs.6000/-
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">            2. Multiplier                                  18</span>
            3. Deduction for personal expenses             2/3rd
            4. Loss of dependency                          Rs.4,32,000/-
            5. Expenses on funeral                         Rs.25,000/-
            6. Loss of love and affection                  Rs.1,00,000/-
</pre><p id="p_3">            The Tribunal has assessed income of the deceased at Rs.6000/-
per month. However, it has been noticed in para 14 of the award that
deceased was pursuing his education and certificates of Matriculation and
Senior Secondary were marked as exhibits. The Tribunal neither bothered to
examine the minimum wage available at the relevant time nor put an effort
to assess appropriate income on the basis of educational status of the
deceased. The minimum wage of an unskilled worker at the relevant time
was Rs.6660.10 per month. Taking a clue from notification issued by the
State of Punjab fixing minimum wage coupled with educational background
of the deceased, income of the deceased is assessed at Rs.7000/- per month.
Claimants shall be entitle to addition in income for future prospects @ 40%.
Multiplier applied by the Tribunal is correct and affirmed.
</p><p id="p_4">            The application for compensation has been filed by unfortunate
parents of deceased Jatin Gilhotra aged about 20 years. The Tribunal despite
noticing that claim has been preferred by parents of the deceased has
deducted 2/3rd towards personal and living expenses on the basis of

 FAO-4691-2017 (O&amp;M)                                                  -2-
</p><p id="p_5">presumption despite noticing judgment of Hon'ble the Supreme Court <a href="/doc/837924/" id="a_1">Sarla
Verma &amp; Ors vs Delhi Transport Corp.&amp; Anr</a>, 2009 (3) RCR (Civil) 77
referred to in para 15 of the award. All these facts go a long way to record
that the Tribunal shirked from its responsibility to assess just and reasonable
compensation. In view of enunciation laid down in Sarla Verma &amp; others's
case (supra), admissible deduction for personal and living expenses would
be 50%. In this manner, loss of dependency is calculated at Rs.10,58,400/-
[(7000 x 12 x 18) + (40% future prospects) - (50% deduction for personal
expenses)].
</p><p id="p_6">                Under conventional heads, compensation awarded by the
Tribunal is modified to the effect that claimants shall be entitle to
Rs.30,000/-, detailed hereunder:-
</p><pre id="pre_3">                1. Expenses on last rites            Rs.15,000/-
                2. Loss of estate                    Rs.15,000/-
</pre><p id="p_7">                Total compensation is Rs.10,88,400/- and the additional amount
is Rs.5,31,400/- (10,88,400 - 5,57,000), payable with interest @ 7.5% per
annum from the date of petition till realization, to mother of the deceased, to
be invested in fixed deposit for a period of three years.
</p><p id="p_8">                Before parting with this order, it is pertinent to note that the
Tribunal in the concluding lines of the award has held that the insurance
company shall be at liberty to claim the amount of compensation from the
owner and driver of Trax Cruiser by filing separate suit. No reasons have
been assigned by the Tribunal for giving this liberty to the insurance
company particularly in the circumstances that the Tribunal has noticed that
the insured is not guilty of violating the terms and conditions of insurance
policy. All the aforesaid lead to conclusion that the Tribunal has disposed of
the case in an arbitrary and whimsical manner and not by taking the legal
principles and law into consideration.
</p><p id="p_9">                A copy of the order be sent to the presiding officer of the
Tribunal concerned at her present place of posting.
</p><p id="p_10">                The appeal is partly allowed in the aforesaid terms.
