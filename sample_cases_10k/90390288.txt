<blockquote id="blockquote_5">                                      "Counsel for the petitioner has argued that apart from
                                the merits of the case, it is admitted that the petitioner was the
                                wife of elder brother of the respondent and after his death, she
                                has not received any inheritance from her late husband.

</p><p id="p_6">                                Today the learned counsel for the petitioner has accepted that in

            a civil suit filed by the respondent the petitioner had appeared and filed a

            written statement also and had subsequently stopped appearing. It is also not

            disputed that the said judgment has become final and has not even been

            challenged despite the fact that copy of the judgment was handed over as far

            back as on 19.05.2014.

            judgment would supersede the jurisdiction of the criminal court.

</p><p id="p_8">                                As regards the contention recorded on the last date, the learned

            counsel for the respondent states that the petitioner and the respondent

            belong to the economic weaker section of the society and his deceased elder

            brother was merely a daily wager and he left behind no moveable or

            immovable property.
