                            The appellant before us is questioning the order dated
                 November 17, 2014. The causes for filing of the present appeal are as
                 under :-
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_1">                            "In the circumstances stated above it is humbly prayed that
                            Your Lordships would graciously be pleased to stay of the
                            operation of the order dated 17.11. 2014 passed by the learned
                            Trial Judge in W.P. 26967 (W) of 2014 and/or pass such other
                            further order or orders as to Your Lordships may seem fit and
                            proper.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">                            An order do issue restraining the respondents particularly the
                            prescribed authority from proceeding further on the basis of
                            the requisition notice dated 4.9.2014 till the writ application is
                            disposed of."</blockquote>

<p id="p_2">                            A notice of meeting on motion was issued on September
                 10, 2014 on the basis of requisition given by requisitionists on
                 September 04, 2014.
</p>
<p id="p_3">                            It is not in dispute that on the same day the so-called
                 requisitionists alleged to have communicated to the Prescribed
                 Authority with regard to the withdrawal of their motion and had
                 communicated the same to the requisitionists before issuing the
                 notice of motion. However, taking a decision on such withdrawal of
                 requisition the Prescribed Authority seems to have issued notice
                 contemplated under Section 12 (3) of the West Bengal Panchayat Act.
</p>
<p id="p_4">                            At that juncture, the writ petitioner/appellant approached
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                  2</span>

the learned Single Judge in the above writ petition. No doubt, against
the interim order granted at the preliminary stage of the proceedings
was subject matter in writ appeal and the writ appeal came to be
disposed of on November 10, 2014 observing as under :-
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_3">            "Learned counsel appearing for the respondent Mr. Bari
            submits that the main matter is taken up for hearing and the
            same is listed before the learned Single Judge. Therefore,
            shortly the writ petition would be disposed of on merits.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">            Having regard to the fact that the interim direction was
            granted, which according to the appellants is affecting their
            right, we are of the opinion that in the light of <a href="/doc/618973/" id="a_1">article 226 (2</a>),
            the appellants have recourse to submit before the learned
            Single Judge, all the contentions in support of their defence.
            Without expressing any opinion on the merits of the present
            appeal, we dispose of the appeal.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">            The appeal is disposed of. Consequently the application for
            stay is also disposed of."</blockquote>


<p id="p_5">            Subsequent to disposal of the writ appeal learned Judge
has vacated the interim order granted earlier and further opined that
any action taken during the pendency of the writ petition shall be
subject to the result of the writ application.
</p>
<p id="p_6">            Now complaint of the appellant is that there was no
application for vacating the interim order by the respondents,
however, learned Judge entertained such request even without
deciding the merits or demerits raised in the writ petition, therefore
they ought not to have accepted the motion of no confidence on the
basis of notice dated September 04, 2014.
</p>
<p id="p_7">            Apparently, the meeting is fixed on December 01, 2014.
What we notice from the order impugned is learned Judge has
discussed the entire materials placed before the Court as well as
contentions raised by both the parties.          The interest of the writ
petitioner is protected by opining that whatever action taken will be
subject to the result of the writ petition.         Ultimately if the writ
petitioner is able to establish his contentions and the writ petition is
allowed, none of the actions taken including action to be taken on
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                 3</span>

December 1, 2014 would go to the benefit of respondents.
</p>
<p id="p_8">            Under such circumstances, we find no ground to interfere
and accordingly, the appeal is disposed of.          Consequently the
application for stay is also disposed of.
</p>
<p id="p_9">            Certified copy of this order, if applied for, be given to the
parties, on priority basis.
</p>
