Present:    Mr. Arihant Jain, Advocate &amp;
            Mr. Arun Jindal, Advocate,
            for the appellants.
                         *****

AMIT RAWAL, J. (Oral)
</pre>
<p id="p_1">CM No.1208-C of 2017

            For the reasons mentioned in the application, which is

supported by an affidavit, delay of 19 days in re-filing the appeal is

condoned.
</p>
<p id="p_2">            CM stands disposed of.
</p>
<p id="p_3">RSA No.562 of 2017

            Appellant-plaintiffs have not been successful in seeking

declaration and injunction by laying challenge to the transfer deeds dated

15.11.2007 executed by Karam Singh- defendant No.1, their father, in

favour of defendant Nos.2 and 3 (son and wife of defendant No.1).

</p><p id="p_4">            It was alleged that the property at the hands of Karam Singh

was ancestral. He could not have transferred the title of land measuring 45

kanals 17 marlas in the manner and mode as indicated above, for, in 2003

defendant No.1 had already disinherited defendant No.2. It was alleged that

 Regular Second Appeal No.562 of 2017 (O&amp;M)                      {2}

Karam Singh had executed a Will dated 23.12.2009 registered on

30.12.2009, but the trial court did not agree with the aforementioned

evidence, pleadings and dismissed the suit. Appeal taken before the Lower

Appellate Court was partly allowed.
</p>
<p id="p_5">            Mr.Arihant Jain, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the

appellant-plaintiffs submitted that the courts below have abdicated in not

noticing the contents of the written statement filed by Karam Singh-

defendant No.1, who admitted that defendant Nos.2 and 3 had played a

fraud upon him in getting the transfer deeds registered. That was a clincher

for the courts below to decree the suit. It could not be understood that once

defendant No.2 was disinherited, how and in what manner, the love and

affection erupted to transfer entire piece of land ignoring the other sons.

Karam Singh died on 02.01.2010, i.e., after two years of the transfer deed.

The present suit was filed on 24.01.2008.
</p>
<p id="p_6">            I am afraid that the aforementioned arguments are not

sustainable, for, the registered transfer deeds have been proved on record

and in such circumstances, the registered Will of December, 2009 in respect

of some other property in the absence of any title and interest would be

meaningless. It is not the case where Karam Singh was espousing the case

of plaintiffs. No criminal case was ever lodged against the beneficiaries of

the land, referred to in the transfer deeds. Registered document carries a

presumption of truth unless and until rebutted by leading cogent evidence,

which is conspicuously absent. The trial court had no other option but to

dismiss the suit. However, the Lower Appellate Court partly allowed the

appeal and set-aside the transfer deed with regard to 4 kanals 16 marlas of

land.

 Regular Second Appeal No.562 of 2017 (O&amp;M)                       {3}

            For the reasons stated above, I do not find any illegality or

perversity in the judgments and decrees under challenge. No ground for

interference is made out, much less involvement of any substantial question

of law. Resultantly, the appeal is dismissed.
