          For the Petitioners:             Mr. Shresth Gautam, Advocate.
          For the State:                   A.C. to A.G.

                              ---------
02/19.03.2018          The petitioners have approached this Hon'ble Court for direction
</pre><p id="p_1">          upon the respondents for their appointment to the post of Sub-Inspector of Police
          by way of limited examination.
</p><p id="p_2">          2.           The case of the petitioners lies in a narrow compass. The present
          petitioners are constable/A.S.I, who have been working with the respondent-
          authorities in different districts since their appointment and have an unblemished
          service career. In view of Rule framed by the State Government, as amended on
          28.01.2016, by way of notification issued under the <a href="/doc/1158685/" id="a_1">Police Act</a>, 1861, an
          advertisement was floated for appointment to the post of Sub-Inspector of Police
          by way of limited vacancy examination, Rule 2016 in which it was clearly
          mentioned that a male candidate should run 10 K.M. within          60 minutes. The
          present petitioners fulfilling the requisite qualification, applied for the same. The
          petitioners qualified in the written exams and were asked to appear in the
          physical exams.
</p><p id="p_3">          3.           It is the case of the petitioners that though they fulfilled requisite
          qualification and were declared successful in the written exams but they could not
          succeed in the physical exams due to unavoidable circumstances, for which the
          respondent-authorities themselves were responsible.
</p><p id="p_4">          4.           It is specific case of the petitioners that they reported at the ground
          premises at 6:30 am itself and there was no arrangement of food and water at
          the enclosed/ isolated area where they were suppose to participate in the physical
          exams. After six long hours, the physical exams were held and the petitioners
          were declared unsuccessful. As the petitioners were declared unsuccessful, they
          represented before the authorities praying therein to give a fresh chance to them
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                    2.</span>
to appear in physical exam as they could not perform well in the physical test due
to the reason that they remained empty stomach for six long hours as there was
no arrangement of food and water at the Ground. The petitioners were
precluded from adequate opportunity of participation in the physical assessment
test vis. a vis. candidates who were allowed to run in the beginning of the
physical test and as such re-exam of physical test shall be allowed for them but
no heed was paid to the representation and as such the petitioner has knocked
the door of this Hon'ble Court.
</p><p id="p_5">5.          Mr. Shrestha Gautam, learned Counsel appearing for the petitioners
strenuously urges that petitioners are working as constable and they are
physically fit and also they have qualified in the written test. If they be given an
opportunity, they would certainly qualify in the physical test also. They were
declared disqualified not because of the reason that they cannot run 10 K.M.
within 60 minutes but because of the fact that they were kept in the premises for
six long hours without food and water and as such because of the prevailing
situation they could not qualify in the physical test.
</p><p id="p_6">6.        Learned Counsel emphatically argues that as the petitioners are
physically fit and if a fresh opportunity is given to them, they can qualify the
physical test.
</p><p id="p_7">7.        Per contra no counter-affidavit has been filed.
</p><p id="p_8">8.        Learned Counsel for the State argues that it is only after the petitioners
have been declared unsuccessful, they have approached this Hon'ble Court with a
frivolous grounds for granting them an opportunity for appearing in fresh physical
exams which cannot be permitted in view of the settled principle of law.
</p><p id="p_9">9.        Learned Counsel submits that once the petitioners have appeared in the
examination, they cannot be permitted to go away from the terms and conditions
as envisaged in the advertisement. The Rule also, as envisaged in the Police
Manual do not permit for a fresh physical examination when the candidates have
appeared and have been declared unsuccessful. The petitioner never challenged
the advertisement at the initial stage.
</p><p id="p_10">10.       Be that as it may, having gone through the rival submissions of the
parties, this Court is of the considered view that it is an admitted fact that the
petitioners were fully aware of the terms and conditions of the advertisement.
Already, they have been working         as a Police constable. They are very much
aware of the terms and conditions as envisaged in the Police Manual. Rule 53
talks about appointment on the post of Sub-Inspector of Police. There cannot be
class within class there has to be one parameter for appointment of Police
personnel whether they are Police constable or Sub-Inspector of Police. There
cannot be different yardstick for appointment. The advertisement was floated in
view of the amended Rules and the petitioners have been declared successful in
the written examination but could not qualify in the Physical test. Several other
candidates along with the petitioners appeared in the said physical exams and
were declared successful, it is only these petitioners who are aggrieved by the
terms and conditions of the advertisement because they could not qualify in the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                   3.</span>
physical test.   The grounds taken by the petitioners are not sustainable in the
eyes of law. The petitioners are members of the disciplined force, they are
required to abide by the terms and conditions of the advertisement. No case is
made out for interference in this writ petition, the same merits dismissal and
accordingly this writ petition stands dismissed.
