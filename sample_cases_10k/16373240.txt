          Dated this the 18th day of December, 2012

                            JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">      The petitioners are 7th semester students of Marian

Engineering College, Trivandrum, a college affiliated to the

University of Kerala. They have filed these writ petitions inter alia

for an order directing the Controller of Examinations to consider

and dispose of the applications submitted by them for condonation

of attendance shortage. They have also sought an interim order

directing the respondents to permit them to appear for the 7th

semester B.Tech degree examination that commenced on

7.11.2012.    By an interim order passed by this Court on

1.11.2012, a learned single Judge of this Court permitted the

petitioners to provisionally appear for the 7th semester B.Tech.

degree examinations. Even while passing that order, this Court

took note of the submission made by the learned standing counsel

for the Kerala University that the Principal of the institution

concerned has to forward the application for condonation of

attendance shortage with his recommendations and then alone

W.P.(C).Nos.24782, 25368
and 25565 of 2012
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                 -:2:-</span>

can the University consider it.
</p>
<p id="p_2">      2. Pursuant to the interim orders passed by this Court, the

petitioners have appeared for the 7th semester B.Tech degree

examination.     The results of the examination have not been

published. The 8th semester classes have already commenced and

pursuant to the orders passed by this Court, the petitioners are

provisionally attending the 8th semester classes.        In such

circumstances I am of the opinion that these writ petitions can be

disposed of with a direction to the Principal of the College to

forward the applications submitted by the petitioners, whether

they are defective or in order, with his recommendations as to

whether the application deserves to be allowed or deserves to be

rejected. As the 8th semester classes have also commenced I am

of the opinion that the Principal should forward the applications

submitted by the petitioners together with his recommendations

to the competent authority in the University forthwith and the

competent authority in the University should thereupon take an

expeditious decision in the matter in accordance with the

regulations. I accordingly dispose of the writ petitions with the

following directions:
</p>
<p id="p_3">W.P.(C).Nos.24782, 25368
and 25565 of 2012
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                  -:3:-</span>

       The Principal of Marian Engineering College, Trivandrum,

shall forward the originals of the applications submitted by the

petitioners for condonation of attendance shortage together with

his recommendations to the competent authority in the University

within one week from the date on which the petitioners produce a

certified copy of this judgment before him.        The competent

authority in the University of Kerala should take an appropriate

decision in the matter in accordance with the regulations

expeditiously and in any case with an outer limit of one month

from the date of receipt of the applications from the Principal of

the college. The entitlement of the petitioners to continue their

studies in the 8th semester and to have the results of the 7th

semester examination declared will depend on the decision to be

taken by the competent authority in the University of Kerala on

their applications for condonation of attendance shortage.
