                 CORAM: HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE JYOTI SARAN
                 ORAL ORDER</pre>

<p id="p_1">5   05-12-2013                 This appeal is directed against the judgment and

                  decree dated 18.1.2012/1.2.2012 passed by the learned

                  Additional District Judge (F.T.C.-II), Saran at Chapra in Title

                  Appeal No.74 of 2006, whereby the appellate court below while

                  reversing the judgment and decree dated 29.7.2000/11.8.2000

                  passed by the learned Subordinate Judge-IV, Saran at Chapra in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1"> Patna High Court SA No.95 of 2012 (5) dt.05-12-2013                                   2</span>




              Title Suit No.302 of 1994, has allowed the appeal.

</p><p id="p_2">                            I shall be referring to the status of the parties as it

              existed before the trial court unless clarified with specific

              reference.
</p>
<p id="p_3">                            The suit in question was filed by the plaintiff to

              declare the sale-deeds stated to have been executed by him in

              favour of the defendants dated 28.10.1994 as void documents. It

              is the case of the plaintiff that he had gone to Village-Anay for

              some work on 27.10.1994 and while he was returning from that

              village the defendant nos.1 to 4 kidnapped him in a car and kept

              him confined in a room at Chapra. It is further the case of the

              plaintiff that on 28.10.1994 the defendants forcibly took his left

              thumb-impression on different stamp papers and later in the

              afternoon they also brought a person who again took his left

              thumb-impression on certain papers, whereafter he was released.

              An FIR was instituted by the grand-son of the plaintiff Upendra

              Singh giving rise to Parsa P.S. Case No.96 of 1994 which was

              led as Exhibit-3. It is further the case of the plaintiff that he later

              gathered information that the defendants had fraudulently got

              prepared certain sale-deeds on the said stamp papers and which

              stood confirmed when he took certified copies thereof on

              31.10.1994 and which showed that the defendants had got
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2"> Patna High Court SA No.95 of 2012 (5) dt.05-12-2013                                  3</span>




              prepared three sale-deeds which were registered on 28.10.1994.

              It was the case of the plaintiff that the sale-deeds were forged

              documents and even if it did bear his left thumb impression, the

              mode and manner in which it has been executed and the fact that

              no consideration money had passed on to him was sufficient to

              prove the charges. It is further the case of the plaintiff that he

              had executed a mortgaged deed in favour of the wife of Gorakh

              Singh who was in possession of the suit land.
</p>
<p id="p_4">                            The defendants appeared and filed their written

              statement contesting the claim of the plaintiff. It was the specific

              case of the defendants that following an agreement for the sale

              of suit land, the plaintiff himself had got the sale-deed prepared

              and put his left thumb-impression thereon. It was the case of the

              defendants that the plaintiff himself presented those sale-deeds

              on 28.10.1994 before the Registrar and also accepted the

              execution thereof. The story of kidnapping was denied by the

              defendants and they also denied of having taken left thumb-

              impression of the plaintiff over the stamp papers. The

              defendants claimed possession over the suit land. It was the case

              of the defendants that Gorakh Singh had no concern over the suit

              land nor was he in possession thereof and the story has been

              introduced by the plaintiff merely to prejudice the case. They

              stressed upon payment of the consideration amount.

</p><p id="p_5">                            The trial court on the basis of the pleadings framed

              seven issues which runs as follows:
</p>

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">                          2.      Have      the       defendants   forcibly   and
                                  fraudulently took the L.T.I. or signature
                                  on the sale deeds?
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">                          3.      Has the plaintiff right and title regarding
                                  the suit properties?
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">                          4.      Is the defendant is bonafide purchaser of

                                  mentioned in the schedules-1 &amp; 2 of the

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_6">                          6.      Is the plaintiff entitled to recover
                                  possession?
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_7">                          7.      Have the plaintiff entitle to get relief and
                                  reliefs in eye of law?</blockquote><p id="p_6">



</p><p id="p_7">                            The trial court on the basis of the pleadings and the

              evidence on record dismissed the suit vide judgment and decree

              dated 29.7.2000/11.8.2000. The plaintiff being aggrieved

              preferred Title Appeal No.74 of 2006 and which was allowed by
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4"> Patna High Court SA No.95 of 2012 (5) dt.05-12-2013                                    5</span>




              the impugned judgment and decree dated 18.1.2012/1.2.2012

              and the judgment of the trial court was reversed. The defendants

              being aggrieved is in appeal before this Court.

</p><p id="p_8">                            I have heard learned counsel for the defendants as

              appellants before this Court. The plaintiff has suo-motu

              appeared through counsel.
</p>
<p id="p_9">                            Of the issues framed by the trial court, issue nos.2, 4,

              and 5 are the core issues requiring a determination. The facts of

              the case having been discussed hereinabove it is manifest that

              whereas it is the case of the plaintiff that the sale-deeds in

              question were got prepared by the defendants after forcibly

              taking his left thumb impression on stamp papers and thus had

              been prepared by resorting to fraud, the defendants have

              contested the contentions on grounds of having been executed

              by the plaintiff on his volition. It is thus to be seen whether the

              plaintiff has been able to make out a case and whether the

              appellate court below having accepted the same, there is any

              error in the judgment and decree impugned. It is not in dispute

              that following the complaint of the plaintiff regarding his alleged

              abduction on 27.10.1994 a police case was registered as Parsa

              P.S. Case No.96 of 1994 under <a href="/doc/695990/" id="a_1">sections 364</a> of the Indian Penal

              Code. The police case having been contested in Sessions Trial
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5"> Patna High Court SA No.95 of 2012 (5) dt.05-12-2013                              6</span>




              No.244 of 1997, vide judgment and order passed by the trial

              court of 9th Additional District and Sessions Judge, Saran at

              Chapra, the accused defendants were found guilty under <a href="/doc/886598/" id="a_2">section

              365</a> of the Indian Penal Code, meaning thereby the allegation

              made by the plaintiff regarding his abduction was upheld by the

              criminal court. The appellate court below has relied upon <a href="/doc/43650/" id="a_3">section

              43</a> of the Evidence Act to support his conclusion on this issue.

              The judgment passed in Sessions Trial No.244 of 1997 was led

              as Exhibit-4.
</p>
<p id="p_10">                            The second aspect which creates a cloud on the

              contentions advanced by the defendants is regarding the mode

              and manner of execution of the sale-deeds in question and the

              payment of the consideration money. Neither the defendants

              could be able to justify the circumstances in which the

              Commissioner was appointed for registration of the document or

              the circumstances prevailing for invoking such provision nor

              have they been able to prove the payment of consideration

              amount. Whereas the deed is stated to have been executed on

              5.9.1994, it was registered before the Commissioner on

              28.10.1994 and the time lag of almost two months is not

              explained.
</p>
<p id="p_11">                            The aspects aforementioned are sufficient to prove
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">         Patna High Court SA No.95 of 2012 (5) dt.05-12-2013                            7</span>




                      that the sale-deeds were got executed by the defendants by

                      resorting to fraud and by forcibly taking the left thumb

                      impression of the plaintiff as also without payment of any

                      consideration amount. An additional factor which goes in favour

                      of the plaintiff is the appointment of commissioner for the

                      registration of the sale-deeds in absence of any circumstance

                      warranting such appointment.
</p>
<p id="p_12">                                    For the reasons aforementioned I am not persuaded to

                      interfere with the judgment and decree impugned and this appeal

                      failing to raise any substantial question of law, is dismissed

                      accordingly.
