                                  [ORAL]

       The petitioner is an IPS officer working under the Government of Assam.

The petitioner admittedly purchased a plot of land bearing Dag No.185 of K.P.

Patta No.248 Village Noonmati Gaon in the district of Kamrup under a registered
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                          2</span>




sale deed dated 22.12.2011 from one Mayur Talukdar for a sum of Rs.72 Lakhs

75 thousand. The purchase was a joint purchase in his name and in the name of

his brother-in-law Anvesh Kumar Goyal.
</p>
<p id="p_4">
</p><p id="p_5">2.     The facts alleged in the writ petition disclose that there was matrimonial

discord between the petitioner and his wife and she had submitted a complaint

to the Government on 02.02.2003, which is as follows:


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">       "I am the legally wedded wife of Shri Anurag Agarwal I.P.S., Presently as
       S.P Karimganj. Our marriage was solemnized at MORADABAD (U.P) on
       31.01.01 and I have a son aged 14th months from that marriage.
       I have borne abuses, mental and physical torture and neglect of myself
       and my son for a long time, but now things have come to such a point
       that i have no option but to report the matter to higher authorities for
       seeking justice for myself and my son. The late of woes is very long, but
       it is being mentioned in brief.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">       Unfortunately from the very beginning my husband and his family
       members, including his sisters and brothers in law, have been extorting
       money running into tens of lacs on one pretext or other and now on
       inability of my father to meet further dowry demand he has deserted me
       and warned my father to face the consequences.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">       I tried to talk to him several times on telephone but he refused to come
       on line. My all letters to him remained un-answered.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">       Of late it is learnt that he wants to get rid of me and re-marry some one
       whose people can fulfil his demands. He has insulted me several times
       and physically assaulted me on the ground that my father has not fulfilled
       his demands. He and his parents, particularly his mother insisted that I
       write on paper that in the event of my death he and his family members
       would not be held responsible. He and his mother wanted to commit my
       murder and the note was got prepared to lay a cover on it.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">       Apart from the above, otherwise also he does not behave like a
       scrupulous person and a member of higher civil services; for example in
       order to get travel concession from Sahara Air-lines he impersonates as
       captain A. Agarwal of sikh regiment and thus makes false declaration in
       forms. He has done it several times for journey between Dibrugarh and
       Delhi. I may point out that one such journey was undertaken between
       20th and 22nd April 2001 between Dibrugarh and Delhi and back. A proper
       inquiry would confirm this fact.
</blockquote><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                      3</span>




<p id="p_6">   He has been transferring a lot of money to his brother- in law from his
   place of posting by sending bank draft from Sadia (Tinsukia) to Gangoh,
   Saharanpur, U.P. in the names of M/s Goyal paints and laxmi cement.

   I understand that even his driving license taken at Gangoh, Saharanpur
   U.P. is not in his own name, but in the name of Anurag Goyal. He appears
   to be in the habit of impersonating by taking different names to suit his
   purpose.
</p>
<p id="p_7">   Above all, his behaviour towards me and his son has been very cruel. In
   my case it extended several times to physical violence. I, as a Hindu wife,
   had to tolerate all this, test we should earn disrepute. But it was extreme
   when he turned me out of house on 22-0402's night at Morighaon asking
   me to go away. I was compelled to give a phone call to my father at
   11.00 at night from a P.C.O. Finding no other alternative at that strange
   place I returned and on my telling my husband that my father would be
   coming to take me, he allowed me to stay for the night.

   When my father came to take me on 23.04.02 my husband insulted him
   shouting that I would not be permitted to stay with him unless my father
   paid further money.
</p>
<p id="p_8">   Far from calling me back or agreeing to my return he has never phoned
   me to enquire about my welfare or that of his son. He has refused to
   attend my calls.
</p>
<p id="p_9">   When on the occasion of his sister's marriage in November2002 my father
   contacted him at Muzuffar Nagar, he again insisted on fulfilment of his
   dowry demands. Not only that, he severely threatened my father saying
   that he was a police officer and it would not be difficult for him to get him
   involved in false cases or to finish him in an encounter. We had no option
   but to silently come back to Moradabad. Thus I and son are forced to stay
   with my parents for last months.
</p>
<p id="p_10">In addition to obtaining false travel concessions in personating as captain
A.Agarwal of Sikh Regiment, his ill treatment had made my life miserable. His
deeds are as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_11">a. Transferring ill gotten money by bank drafts from Sadia to Gangoh, Distt.
   Saharanpur.
</p><p id="p_12">b. By having a false driving licence in the name of Anurag Goyal.
c. By not heeding to the advise for keeping me and our child with him.
d. By pressing for dowry demand time and again and.
</p><p id="p_13">e. By threatening my father to get him involved in false cases and
   elimination in an encounter.
</p><p id="p_14">f. He has illegally retained my ornaments etc. which is my stridhan and is
   returnable to me.
</p>
<p id="p_15">I may respectfully state that I belong to a family of repute and high
education. I myself hold doctorate degree in psychology and some of my
relatives are very senior Govt. Officers. I want the matter to be settled
through the department so that I may be able to lead a normal life. I may
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                          4</span>




     mention that my own conduct can be verified from my husband's superiors of
     all his earlier postings.
</p>
<p id="p_16">         I request your honour to take appropriate action in the matter by getting
     the events inquired into."
</p>
<p id="p_17">

</p><p id="p_18">3.      The allegations in the complaint were enquired into by the Director

General of Police, Inspector General of Police (CID) and Addl. Director General of

Police (CID). Finally, the Commissioner and Secretary, Home (A) Department

passed the following order on 26.09.2010, which is as follows:


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_6">        "Notes from page 117N may kindly be seen.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_7">        The report from ADGP (CID) can be seen at Sl.455c-485c. The issue
        relating to Shri Anurag Agarwal, IPS, is pending since 2003 and we are
        yet to initiate either a departmental proceeding against him or register a
        regular vigilance case against him.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_8">        ADGP (CID) has examined the matter thoroughly and it appears that
        there is no corroborating evidence or document, necessitating initiation of
        disciplinary action against him.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_9">        We may therefore give Shri Agarwal IPS the benefit of doubt and drop
        the matter."
</blockquote><p id="p_19">4.      Consequent to the said order, with the approval of Hon'ble the Chief

Minister, Assam, the Home (A) and Political Department, issued a communication

to the Director General of Police, dated 22.02.2011, which is as follows:


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_10">        "I am directed to invite a reference to your letter on the subject cited
        above in connection with the allegations leveled against Shri Anurag
        Agarwal, IPS, by Smti Shefali Agarwal &amp; others. The Government have
        examined the matter and by taking into consideration the facts and
        circumstances and material on records, it has been decided to close the
        matter."
</blockquote><p id="p_20">5.      The Additional Director of Vigilance and Anti-Corruption seems to have

made a request to the Government for conducting preliminary enquiry against

the petitioner vide letter No.DGVA/CA 1598, dated 03.12.2005. Pursuant to the

said request, the Deputy Secretary, Govt. of Assam, in the communication, dated
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                         5</span>




09.01.2008, informs the Additional Director General of Police (Vigilance) that the

Government has approved to initiate a preliminary enquiry to be conducted by

him against the petitioner and to furnish report to the Government within the

stipulated period. The copy of the said communication is extracted hereunder for

convenient reference:
</p>
<p id="p_21">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_11">       "In inviting a reference to your letter indicated above, I am directed to
       inform you that the Govt. has approved to initiate a preliminary enquiry to
       be conducted by you against Shri Anurag Agarwal, IPS and furnish the
       report to the Govt. within the stipulated period."
</blockquote><p id="p_22">6.     Pursuant to the above communication, a preliminary enquiry was

conducted by Inspector of Police, Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Cell, and

submitted its final report dated 25.01.2013. The findings of the preliminary

enquiry are as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_23">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_12">       "Findings:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_13">       During discreet enquiry, acting on a secret information, I came to know
       that Shri Anurag Agarwal, IPS, has purchased a big plot of land with
       building at Ganesh Mandir Path, Noonmati, at the cost of few crores of
       rupees. On receipt of this information as to establish the purchase of land
       with building etc, I have visited the office of the Deputy Commissioner,
       Kamrup (Metro) Guwahati, Sub-Registrar, Kamrup (Metro) Guwahati and
       other places having relevance in connection with this enquiry. In course
       of enquiry, while consulting with the records, in record branch of the
       relevant office, it was found and ascertained that Shri Anurag Agarwal,
       S/o. Sadhuram Agarwal of Roorke house No.563/1 PS-Gang Nagar in the
       district of Haridwar, Uttar Pradesh, made and executed a deed of
       agreement for sale of a plot of land measuring 64.95 ARE 4 Bigha, 4
       katha and 5 lecha covered by Dag No.46/old, 185 (New) of KP Patta
       No.95 (old)/248 (New) situated at Noonmati under Mouza Ulubari
       together with a RCC building standing thereon over the said plot of land
       in the district of Kamrup (M) description of which is bounded by North
       land of Mr. Neog South Land of Dag No.46, East-Ganesh Mandir road and
       land of Mala Barkakoti and in west-land of Dag No.46 with the seller of
       this above mentioned plot of land and building owner namey Mayur
       Talukdar and the said deed of agreement for sale of the above mentioned
       plot of land and building was made and executed in the Sr. Sub-
       Registrar's office on 18th Dec, 2011.
</blockquote><span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                   6</span>




<p id="p_24">During discreet enquiry, also collected a copy of sale permission issued by
Shri Nareswar Upadhyay, ACS, Addl. Deputy Commissioner, Kamrup (M)
Guwahati vide letter No.KRM(M)5/2010/9300 dated Guwahati 04/11/2011
where it was mentioned and fixed value of sale at Rs.15.00 lacs per
bigha. Thus, on 22.12.2011 the deed of sale was executed in the office of
Sr. Sub-Registrar, Kamrup (M) Guwahati, Shri Manjit Kr. Das was the
Sub-Registrar under whose signature the deed of registration was
executed between the seller and purchasers. On scrutiny of the said deed
of sale it was found that the Govt. approved zonal value of land as
regards amount payable as registration fees and stamp duty for
registration of documents were not taken into the account and blatantly
flouted. As per deed of sale, total land measuring 4 bighas 4 kathas and 5
lechas whose value of sale was taken at Rs.46.00 lacs and paid the
registration fees and stamp duty for registration of documents. Just to
minimize the fees as well as to hush up the assets in ulterior motive.
Causing loss to the Govt. revenue/fees etc and there is malafide reasons
behind it.
</p>
<p id="p_25">The Govt. of Assam vide letter No.REGN61/2005/52 dated Dispur the 30th
Nov/2006, the Additional Chief Secretary, Assam Revenue Department
has given guidelines for fixation of Zonal valuation of lands in the State of
Assam and for the purpose (1) the Inspector General of Registration,
Assam (2) All Deputy Commissioners (except hills and BTAD districts) (3)
All SDO (Civil) were duly informed.
</p><p id="p_26">In response to the above guidelines, the Deputy Commissioner Kamrup
(M) Guwahati issued notification vide order No.KRS 423/2011 dated
20.08.2011 and fixed the Zonal valuation which came into effect from 20th
August, 2011. As per the rate the fixation of zonal valuation of land from
Anuradha to Noonmati was fixed @ Rs.75,00,000/- per bigha.

As per the Govt. notification, zonal valuation fixed at Rs.75,00,000/- per
bigha. Therefore, the total value of land measuring 4 bigha 4 katha and 5
lecha will be Rs.3,63,75,000/- which is the actual Govt. zonal fixed value.
But here in this case, the total deed money was shown at Rs.72,75,000/-.
Now if we deduct the deed value of Rs.72,75,000/- from the actual Govt.
zonal fixed value of Rs.3,63,75,000/- then the amount which was not
shown in the deed will stand at Rs.2,91,00000/-.
</p>
<p id="p_27">As per Govt. rule Rs.85/- per 1000 fixed as registration fees. Hence, the
total value of registration fees of total land value of Rs.3,63,75,000 -
72,75,000 = 2,91,00000 ÷ 1000 x 85 = 24,73,500/-.
</p>
<p id="p_28">On the other hand, as per Govt. rule the fixed stamp duty at the rate of
Rs.8%. Hence, the total value of stamp duty of total land value of
Rs.3,63,75,000 - 72,75,000 = 2,91,00000 ÷ 100 x 8 = 23,28,000.
Therefore, Rs.24,73,500 + 23,28,000 = 48,01,500/- which is loss to the
Govt. and gain to the purchaser/purchasers.
</p>
<p id="p_29">The officers of different branches working under the Deputy
Commissioner, Kamrup (M), Guwahati, who were responsible for causing
loss to the Govt. amounting to Rs,48,01,500/- by minimizing the Govt.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                 7</span>




fixed zonal valuation of land with ulterior motive will come to the light
during open enquiry/case as to enable us to unearth the real facts.

During discreet enquiry, it was revealed that Shri Anvesh Kumar Goyal,
S/o. Jaduram Goyal resident of Chatta Street, PS Gangoh in the district of
Saharanpur, Uttar Pradesh, whose name was not found in the deed of
agreement made and executed on 18.11.2011 by Shri Anurag Agarwal
and Shri Mayur Talukdar i.e., both the purchasers and seller. But
suddenly the name of Shri Anvesh Kr Goyal was included in the deed of
sale dated 22.12.2011. The relation of Shri Anvesh Goyal with Shri
Anurag Agarwal and the financial position of Shri Anvesh Goyal are yet to
be verified which is not possible in the present stage of enquiry except a
Regular enquiry/Case. It is strongly suspected that the name of Shri
Goyal was shown only to minimize the financial implication of Shri
Agarwal by dividing the value of already undervalued land deed.

While consulting with the sale permission it was found vide memo No.
KRM(M)5/2010/9300 dated 4.11.11 that in Sl No.1 of condition it was
mentioned that the amount payable as registration fees and stamp duty
for registration of documents with reference to the NOC shall be
determined by the amount of actual consideration agreed upon by the
seller and the purchasers or Govt. approved zonal value of land applicable
to land of the connected village whichever is higher.

Hence, in this case, it was considered the actual Govt. fixed approved
rate which is higher than the deed price and the Govt. approved rate in a
total amount of Rs.3,63,75000/- so the total cost of land excluding the
standing RCC building whose value at the time of purchase was not
mentioned. It is a fact that the movable assets and deposits and other
expenditure could not be ascertained in the present stage of enquiry.

As regards assets acquired by Shri Anurag Agarwal during the tenure as
SDPO Sadiya it was found related to transferring money by draft etc
which requires an open enquiry.
</p>
<p id="p_30">The income received by Shri Anurag Agarwal from 1998 to Nov, 2012 was
taken from a IPS cadre of 1998 whose pay and allowances are equivalent
to him. Hence, the total income from pay and allowances received by him
during the period from 1998 to Nov, 2012, will be approx net salary =
Rs.47,22,879/-. If we deduct 33% (family maintenance) from his net
salary income of Rs.47,22,879/-, then the income will remain at
Rs.31,64,329/-.
</p>
<p id="p_31">From the above, it appears that the income of Shri Agarwal is
Rs.31,64,329 whereas his expenditure (excluding movable assets, deposit
and other expenditure) is Rs.3,63,75000/-. Hence, an amount of
Rs.3,32,10,671/- is found disproportionate beyond his known source of
income, which he earned during the tenure of his service from 1998 to
Nov, 2012.

<p id="p_32">Under the facts and circumstances stated above, I, therefore, suggest to
accord necessary approval of the Govt. of Assam for an open enquiry i.e.,

       regular enquiry/case as to enable us to dig out the real facts as regards
       involvement of the officers who were found causing wrongful loss of
       Govt. revenue/fees etc by minimizing the Govt. approved fixation rate etc
       of the land in question.

<p id="p_33">       Further in acquiring huge assets by Shri Agarwal, IPS, amounting to
       Rs.3,32,10,671/- which is disproportionate to his known source of
       income.
</p>
<p id="p_34">       This is glaring example of minimizing the Govt. approved rate in fixing the
       value of land so many such type of cases will come into light if a thorough
       and open enquiry is made where crores of Govt. revenue/fees etc are
       involved.

       Corruption, Assam, Srimantapur, Guwahati, for favour of kind perusal and
       taking necessary action."
</p><p id="p_36">7.     The gist of the preliminary enquiry discloses that :


</p><p id="p_37">       (1) the agreement for sale entered with the purchaser is only in the name

of the petitioner whereas the sale deed was jointly in the name of the petitioner

and his brother-in-law, Anvesh Kumar Goyal.
</p>
<p id="p_38">
</p><p id="p_39">       (2) The value of the property purchased as per the registered sale deed is

Rs.72 lakhs 75 thousand. The minimum value fixed by the Government for

registration is Rs.75 lakhs per bigha whereas the petitioner unduly influenced the

Revenue officers and got the value fixed at Rs.15 Lakhs per bigha and, thus,

purchased the property for undervaluation.
</p>
<p id="p_40">
</p><p id="p_41">       (3) The actual market value of the property will be Rs. 3 crores and odd

whereas the petitioner's annual income for the period was Rs.47 lakhs and odd

only. The under valuation of the property is about Rs. 2 crores 91 lakhs. The said

amount is said to be disproportionate to the known source of income of the

petitioner.

</p><p id="p_43">                    (4) The petitioner has paid lesser stamp duty and still he should have

paid Rupees forty eight lakhs one thousand and five hundred. The said amount

was not paid and thus the petitioner has caused dishonest loss to the

Government revenue.
</p>
<p id="p_44">
</p><p id="p_45">8.                  In view of the said material, in the preliminary report, it is concluded that

there is a prima facie case against the petitioner and permission was sought for a

full length regular enquiry in the matter. Accordingly, permission is granted for a

full length regular enquiry.
</p>
<p id="p_46">
</p><p id="p_47">9.                  The petitioner filed a writ petition challenging initiation of the preliminary

enquiry. In the course of the writ petition, preliminary enquiry was conducted

and also a full-fledged regular enquiry was ordered. Therefore, the petitioner

amended the writ petition seeking relief of quashing of the preliminary report

and also quashing of approval for the full-fledged regular enquiry.


</p><p id="p_48">10.                 The petitioner has produced a notification dated 20.08.2011 fixing

registration value of the properties in the Metropolitan district of Kamrup. As per

the said notification, the rate fixed for different areas for different location in the

tabular column of the value of the properties are as follows:

</pre><p id="p_74">18.       On the other hand, it is submitted that it is not only the purchase of the

land by the petitioner is a solitary transaction showing land value at Rs.15 lakhs

per bigha. The six more transactions as per the statement issued by the Sub-

Registrar extracted supra disclose that the land in respect of the said transactions

is also sold at Rs.15 lakhs per bigha as per the valuation fixed by the Additional

Deputy Commissioner, Kamrup (Metro). Therefore, the very premise that the

land has been undervalued at the undue influence of the petitioner is contrary to

the documentary material produced by the petitioner. The land value has been

bonafidely fixed by the Revenue official and accordingly sale price is paid at the

time of registration of the document. It may be that the authorities felt that the

land value for entire Noonmati village irrespective of its distance from the road

has a greater market value potential and, thus, issued an amended notification

fixing the value at Rs.75 lakhs per bigha for the entire village of Noonmati and

accordingly value has been enhanced subsequent to the transaction, in question.


</p><p id="p_75">19.       The assumption or surmise of the vigilance and Anti-Corruption Cell that

the property has been undervalued and that the petitioner has undisclosed

income of Rs.2 crores 91 lakhs is without any substantial basis. The seller in his

statement given to the vigilance authorities has categorically stated that there is

no under-valuation of the property or excess payment made to him over the

value shown in the sale deed shown by him. Therefore, the contention of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">                                         17</span>




vigilance cell that the petitioner has undisclosed income of Rs. 2 crore and 91

lakhs is totally unfounded and mala fide.
</p>
<p id="p_76">
</p><p id="p_77">20.    The petitioner in his petition has stated that he is being unduly

persecuted time and again by certain of the officers who are inimical in dispose

to him to see that he does not get the gallantry award from the President. In this

regard, counsel for the petitioner submits that the petitioner's name has been

referred for gallantry award and proposal for three gallantry awards are pending

because of the want of vigilance clearance.
</p>
<p id="p_78">
</p><p id="p_79">21.    In view of the said material, it is argued that the preliminary enquiry

report and the approval granted for regular enquiry are all actuated with

malicious motives. The allegation of purchase of property by undervaluation and

the allegation of undisclosed income of Rs.2 crores 91 lakhs are all unfounded

and baseless. Hence, argued that the preliminary report and the approval

granted for regular enquiry is to be quashed.
</p>
<p id="p_80">
</p><p id="p_81">22.    Shri H. Rahman, learned Additional Advocate General, argued that the

preliminary enquiry report and the affidavit filed by the investigating officer

before this Court disclose that the petitioner and his brother-in-law did not co-

operate in the enquiry and they avoided to assist the enquiry with regard to the

source of income whatever shown in the sale deed.
</p>
<p id="p_82">
</p><p id="p_83">23. Mr. Rahman submitted that the bank loans obtained by the petitioner is

subsequent to the sale transactions and his claim that he had borrowed loans

from the relatives by RTGS transfer through Bank and the said loan amounts

borrowed from the relatives was repaid after the bank loan was sanctioned is a

doubtful version, which requires to be enquired. Counsel for the petitioner, in this
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">                                          18</span>




regard, has produced the original passbook of the petitioner of State Bank of

India, which shows the amounts he got transferred by RTGS from his relatives

and also its repayment to the relatives through RTGS. The passbook contains

entries from 21.08.2010 to 13.10.2014.
</p>
<p id="p_84">
</p><p id="p_85">24.    The further contention of the respondent is that the particulars for the

source of money for purchase is dubious. Counsel for the respondent relied upon

the decision of the Supreme Court in Union of India and others Vs. Upendra

Singh, reported in (1994) 3 SCC 357.
</p>
<p id="p_86">
</p><p id="p_87">25.    In the cited case, the Central Administrative Tribunal quashed the

charges of misconduct against the delinquent. In appeal, the Supreme Court in

para 6 of the said decision has made the following observations:


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_22">       "6.In the case of charges framed in a disciplinary inquiry the tribunal or
       court can interfere only if on the charges framed (read with imputation or
       particulars of the charges, if any) no misconduct or other irregularity
       alleged can be said to have been made out or the charges framed are
       contrary to any law. At this stage, the tribunal has no jurisdiction to go
       into the correctness or truth of the charges. The tribunal cannot take over
       the functions of the disciplinary authority. The truth or otherwise of the
       charges is a matter for the disciplinary authority to go into. Indeed, even
       after the conclusion of the disciplinary proceedings, if the matter comes
       to court or tribunal, they have no jurisdiction to look into the truth of the
       charges or into the correctness of the findings recorded by the
       disciplinary authority or the appellate authority as the case may be. The
       function of the court/tribunal is one of judicial review, the parameters of
       which are repeatedly laid down by this Court. It would be sufficient to
       quote the decision in H.B. Gandhi, Excise and Taxation Officer-cum-
       Assessing Authority, Kamal v. Gopi Nath &amp; Sons. The Bench comprising
       M.N. Venkatachaliah, J. (as he then was) and A.M. Ahmadi, J., affirmed
       the principle thus :
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_23">       8) "Judicial review, it is trite, is not directed against the decision but is
       confined to the decision-making process. Judicial review cannot extend to
       the examination of the correctness or reasonableness of a decision as a
       matter of fact. The purpose of judicial review is to ensure that the
       individual receives fair treatment and not to ensure that the authority
       after according fair treatment reaches, on a matter which it is authorized
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">                                            19</span>




        by law to decide, a conclusion which is correct in the eyes of the Court.
        Judicial review is not an appeal from a decision but a review of the
        manner in which the decision is made. It will be erroneous to think that
        the Court sits in judgment not only on the correctness of the decision
        making process but also on the correctness of the decision itself."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_88">26.     In its decision in Bhaiji Vs. Sub-Divisional Officer, Thandla and

others, reported in (2003) 1 SCC 692, the Supreme Court held that issuance

of show-cause notice for initiation of enquiry cannot be quashed since it is at a

pre-mature stage for the Court to entertain the plea for quashing.


</p><p id="p_89">27.     Upon thorough consideration of the facts, documentary materials and

submissions made at the Bar, the following questions arise for consideration:


(1)     Whether the findings in the preliminary enquiry are in consistent with the

authentic material, which are public documents?
</p>
<p id="p_90">
(2)     Whether the preliminary report of the vigilance and anti-corruption, which

is the basis for initiating regular enquiry, justifies initiation of regular enquiry?


(3)     Whether it could be said that the petitioner has exercised undue influence

and purchased the property at undervalue and whether he possessed

undisclosed income of Rs.2 crore 91 lakhs more than the known sources of

income of Rs. 47 lakhs and odd?
</p>
<p id="p_91">
(4)     Whether the petitioner has satisfactorily explained his income and the

income of his brother-in-law for purchase of the property, in question?


</p><p id="p_92">28.     The notification, dated 20.08.2011, with the tabular column pertaining to

different villages in the Kamrup (Metro) disclose fixation of registration value of

the properties at different locations. The said document is undisputedly an

authentic and inscrutably credible material. In the said document, the properties
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">                                           20</span>




in Anuradha to Noonmati within 200 meters the value is fixed at Rs.75 lakhs per

bigha and beyond 200 meters, no fixation of value is provided. Therefore, it is for

the Deputy Commissioner to fix the value. The petitioner has produced credible

material to show that his purchaser has applied to Deputy Commissioner for

fixation of registration value for the purpose of registration. The Additional

Deputy Commissioner has issued a certificate fixing the market value of Rs.15

lakhs per bigha. The said assessment of value is not in conflict with the

notification dated 20.08.2011 because the property is obviously beyond 200

meters. When there is no official fixation in the notification, it is obviously for the

Deputy Commissioner considering the attending circumstances and advantages

and disadvantages has fixed the registration value at Rs.15 lakhs per bigha and it

is at the instance of the seller. The other six sale transactions have been

registered for the same value in respect of the same locality. It may be that in

the year 2013, the authorities realized that the potential value of the property in

the entire Noonmati area is quite high and, therefore, fixed the value at Rs.75

lakhs per bigha irrespective of the distance of 200 meters from the road. In view

of the said material, it cannot be said that there is any undue influence or

misrepresentation either by the seller or by the purchaser in getting the market

value fixed. The fixation of the market value by the Additional Deputy

Commissioner also cannot be said as mala fide and contrary to the notification.


</p><p id="p_93">29.    With regard to the source of purchase, the bank statement of Sivalik

Mercantile Co-operative Bank and passbook of SBI of the petitioner clearly

disclose the source of purchase money paid to the seller. All the transactions are

by RTGS through Bank. There has been no cash payment. Therefore, it is

obvious that in a transaction where value of the property is more than 10 lakhs,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">                                          21</span>




the registration authorities will refer the transaction to the Income Tax

Department and they would enquire into the source of income. If the source of

income stated by the petitioner is doubtful or dubious, definitely, there would

have been initiation of enquiry by the Income Tax authorities. The vigilance wing

has not produced any material nor investigated at the time of preliminary enquiry

in respect of that aspect of the matter as to whether the Income Tax department

has initiated any enquiry on the ground that the source of money for the

purchase is undisclosed income of the petitioner or his brother-in-law. That

apart, in the sale deed, the details of mode of payment at different instances

through the bank to the seller have been incorporated. It appears that

deliberately no effort is made in the preliminary enquiry to ascertain the

correctness of the materials furnished in the sale deed. On the other hand, the

bank statements and passbook produced by the petitioner substantially

corroborate his version regarding the source and mode of payment made to the

seller.
</p>
<p id="p_94">
</p><p id="p_95">30.       The assumption or surmise on the part of the vigilance that the property

is undervalued and that the petitioner has undisclosed income of Rs. 2 crores 91

lakhs, which is against the known source of income is an untenable assumption.

When the seller has categorically stated that the sale price given to him is as per

the sale price noted in the sale deed, it cannot be assumed or infered that the

seller has been paid the sale price more than what is stated in the deed. In the

absence of any such adverse information from the seller, it is untenable for the

vigilance to infer that undervaluation of Rs. 2 crores 91 lakhs is an undisclosed

income possessed by the petitioner.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">                                           22</span><p id="p_96">




</p><p id="p_97">31.     In the face of the statement of the seller that he has been paid only the

sale value, even assuming for a moment that it was a case of an undervaluation,

it does not suggest that the petitioner can be indicted of possessing

disproportionate income against his known source of income because the value

paid by the petitioner to the seller is the one as disclosed in the sale deed.

Merely because the value of the property is more, it cannot be assumed that the

petitioner had disproportionate undisclosed income in the absence of the

statement to that effect by the seller.
</p>
<p id="p_98">
</p><p id="p_99">32.     The Additional Advocate General submits that the requisition, dated

19.07.2013, was issued to the petitioner to submit his assets and liability

statement and that he did not submit the statement. Per contra, the counsel for

the petitioner submits that on 17.08.2013, the petitioner has submitted the

assets and liability statement for the period till December, 2011, from the date of

his service.
</p>
<p id="p_100">
</p><p id="p_101">33.     In view of the reasons discussed above, question Nos.1 and 3 are

answered in negative. Question Nos.2 and 4 are answered in affirmative.


</p><p id="p_102">34.     The findings in the preliminary report are blatantly contrary to the

material and official records, namely, with regard to registration price fixed for

the purpose of registration by the authorities for registering the land, in question.

The petitioner has substantially established his source of income for the

purchase.
</p>
<p id="p_103">
</p><p id="p_104">35.     In the face of such material, the contention of the learned Additional

Advocate General that permission be granted for regular enquiry is untenable. In

fact, the decision of the Supreme Court in Upendra Singh's case disclose that
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">                                              23</span>




the Court can only interfere if on the charges framed, no misconduct or other

irregularity alleged is established. In this case, the findings in the preliminary

report and the sanction for regular enquiry are blatantly contrary to the record

and do not disclose any sort of misconduct on the part of the petitioner. In that

view of the matter, the writ petition is allowed. The preliminary enquiry report

and the order of regular enquiry are quashed.
</p>
<p id="p_105">
</p><p id="p_106">36.    The material produced by the petitioner shows that his name was

referred thrice for President's gallantry award and for the want of vigilance

clearance, he has not been given the gallantry award. However, for the purpose

of this case, that aspect is not relevant.
</p>
<p id="p_107">
</p><p id="p_108">37.    With regard to the contempt petition, there appears to be some confusion

on the part of the petitioner in understanding the scope of the enquiry, in

question. The issue involved in the enquiry is not related to the earlier complaint

given by his wife. It is an independent transaction not connected with the

complaint given by the wife. The fact that the complaint given by the wife is

closed, does not by itself prevent the Government from proceeding with the

enquiry into the alleged distinct misconduct. Therefore, the initiation and conduct

of enquiry during the pendency of the writ petition after the interim order does

not appear to be a willful misconduct. In that view, the contempt petition is

dismissed.
