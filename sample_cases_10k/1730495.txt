Civil Revision No. 6958 of 2009 (O&amp;M)

Date of decision: November 30, 2009

JCT Limited Phagwara
                                                           .. Petitioner

                   Vs.

East India Transport Agency and others
                                                           .. Respondents

Coram:       Hon'ble Mr. Justice A.N. Jindal

Present:     Mr. C.B. Goel, Advocate for the petitioner.

A.N. Jindal, J
             The petitioner has invoked the provisions of <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_1">Article 227</a> of the
Constitution of India for setting aside the order dated 3.8.2009 passed by the
Civil Judge (Jr. Division), Phagwara declining the request of the petitioner
to tender supplementary examination in chief by way of supplementary
affidavit.
             The petitioner had already tendered into evidence his
examination in chief by way of affidavit Ex.PA. Cross examination has not
been conducted upon him and the case was adjourned to 19.2.2009. The
learned counsel for the petitioner has urged for tendering supplementary
affidavit Ex.PA dated 6.10.2008 for adding to his examination in chief to be
read with the earlier affidavit Ex.PA dated 10.8.2007.
             The arguments advanced by the learned counsel for the
petitioner weigh with the mind of this court as both the affidavits are part of
examination in chief. Cross examination had not so far been conducted
upon him, therefore, the facts, if any, came to happen during the subsequent
period the same could be brought on record and there was no bar to file
additional affidavit to supplement his examination in chief so long as cross
examination had not commenced. Similar proposition arose in case <a href="/doc/1834734/" id="a_2">Rajesh
Verma vs. Aminex Holdings &amp; Investments &amp; Ors</a>. 2008 (3) Civil Court
Cases 160 (Bombay) wherein it was observed as under :-


             "12. The Counsel for the Defendants, would, however, argue
             that in the examination-in-chief, the Plaintiff has made no
 Civil Revision No. 6958 of 2009                        -2-

                                   ***
</pre>
<p id="p_1">           mention about the fact as to who had signed the said document
           and whether it was signed in his presence or that he was in a
           position to identify the signature appearing on the said
           document. According to the Defendants, this evidence ought to
           have come in the affidavit in lieu of examination-in-chief as is
           required to be filed in terms of Order XVIII Rule 4 of the CPC.
           It was argued that although the Plaintiff later on entered the
           witness box and his further examination-in-chief has been
           recorded by the Court, in which all necessary details are
           mentioned in relation to the suit Bill of Exchange, that
           evidence cannot be looked into. This argument deserves to be
           merely stated to be rejected. There is nothing in the amended
           CPC which precludes the Court from recording further
           examination-in-chief of the Plaintiff.    In the present case,
           recording of further examination-in-chief of the Plaintiff was
           necessitated as the Defendants admitted all documents relied
           by the Plaintiffs, except the suit Bill of Exchange. For that
           reason, the Plaintiff, upon entering the witness box, was first
           examined for the purpose of further examination-in-chief. He
           deposed about the details in relation to the execution of said
           document, whereafter the document was taken on record and
           marked as Exhibit P9. Ideally, the Plaintiff could have spoken
           about such details in the affidavit filed in lieu of examination-
           in-chief.   However, failure to mention those details in the
           affidavit does not preclude the Plaintiff to enter into the
           witness box to depose further; nor does it preclude the Court
           from permitting the Plaintiff to lead further evidence of
           examination-in-chief before the Court in addition to the
           affidavit in lieu of examination-in-chief already placed on
           record, filed in terms of Order XVIII Rule 4 of CPC. All that
           the Court ought to ensure is that the Defendants gets fair
           opportunity to cross-examine the Plaintiff on matters deposed
           by him in the further examination-in-chief."

<p id="p_2">                                     ***

            The documents which are sought to be tendered by way of
examination in chief vide affidavit came into existence subsequently, as
such, these could be proved by the witness in examination in chief to which
the defendant would have full opportunity to cross examine. To direct the
plaintiff to move the application for additional evidence and then to invite
application for examination would only complicate the issues and result into
miscarriage of justice. However, the inconvenience or the grievances as
occurred to the defendant for not disclosing the facts by way of first
affidavit could be compensated by way of costs. Consequently, the instant
petition is allowed subject to payment of Rs.3000/- as costs.
</p><p id="p_3">            This petition is disposed of without issuing notice to the
respondents with a view to impart complete justice to the parties and to save
the huge expenses, which may be incurred by the respondents as also in
order to avoid unnecessary delay in adjudication of the matter. Still, if
dissatisfied, the respondents may move to this court for recalling this order.
