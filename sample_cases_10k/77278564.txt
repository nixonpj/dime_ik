     consent terms.      The learned trial judge ordered to issue notice. The

     respondent appeared in the matter and filed her reply to application Exh.17

     and prayed to reject the application Exh.17. By the impugned order dated

     of C.P.C. which clearly contemplates that before passing the compromise

     decree, the court must satisfy itself that suit has been adjusted wholly or in
   



     part by any lawful agreement or compromise. It is submitted that, when

     the petitioner has filed objection at Exh.17 and raised question to the





     genuineness of the consent terms and raised allegations against the

     plaintiff and created doubts of the consent terms then in such case, the

     learned judge has erred in not appreciating that the provisions of Order





     XXII Rule 3 of C.P.C. clearly contemplated that agreement or terms which

     is void or voidable under the <a href="/doc/171398/" id="a_2">Indian Contract Act</a> 1872 shall not be deemed

     to be lawful and therefore, instead of rejecting the application at Exh.17,

     the trial court ought to have conducted proper enquiry in the suit. It is

     submitted that consent terms are not obtained by free consent of the

     petitioner. Hence, complete adjudication is necessary and instead the trial

     provisions and the judgments cited by the parties and rejected the

     application Exh.17 filed by the petitioner. The findings recorded by the trial

     Supreme Court held that the petition for compromise must be signed by

     manner. However, in the facts of the present case, compromise terms are

     presence of the parties and advocates. The said terms of the compromise
                         
     were read over to the parties and after due exercise, as contemplated

     under    relevant   provisions,   the    compromise    terms     are     recorded.

     conclusion that there was no element of fraud or coercion involved when
   



     the terms of compromise were arrived between the parties and

     subsequently recorded.

            Bare reading of the said proviso makes it clear that it is only when
      

            adjustment and satisfaction is alleged by one party and denied by
            the other side, the question of setting aside the consent decree

     is only in those cases, where the consent terms as a whole, on the ground
                      
     that fraud, misrepresentation or of similar ground are challenged, then the

     Court has to decide the issue. Coming to the facts of the present case, the

     Crores and 45 Lacs for the property bearing survey No. 51/2A, situated at

     Shirdi, Tq. Rahata, District Ahmednagar. It is evident that the deed of

     conveyance is executed between the parties. The contention of learned





     senior counsel for the petitioner that, clause 3 of the consent terms was

     under fraud, coercion and it was signed by the petitioner under coercion





     and signatures are obtained by fraud and therefore, the petitioner has

     challenged the consent terms as       a whole, cannot be accepted.             The

     contention appears to be that the property bearing survey No. 51/4 situated

     at Shirdi, Tq. Rahata, District Ahmednagar is released without any

     consideration. The said contention is devoid of any merits.
