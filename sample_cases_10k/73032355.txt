        Registrar is in exercise of powers conferred upon him by Section

        81 of the Maharashtra Co-operative Societies Act, 1960 (MCS Act).

        By the impugned order dated 12th May 2017, the District Deputy

        Registrar has appointed a Test Auditor to audit the accounts of the

        petitioner society.

        6]      Mr. Sakhare, learned Senior Advocate for the petitioners

        submits that the impugned order dated 12 th May 2017 is vitiated by

        malafides. He submits that in this       case necessary audit was

        conducted by the petitioner society and there was nothing illegal or

        irregular detected. In these circumstances, Mr. Sakhare submits

        that the District Deputy Registrar had no jurisdiction to make the

        impugned order and appoint Test Auditor.

<p id="p_15">

        7]      Learned AGP submits that the impugned order dated 12th May

        2017 has already worked out itself. He submits that the Test Auditor

        has not only audited the accounts of the petitioner society but has

        further submitted his report to the Registrar in terms of the

        provisions of Section 81 of the MCS Act. Learned AGP further

        submits that from perusal of the impugned order it is quite clear that

        the petitioner society had failed to appoint any Auditor or audited

        its accounts right from its inception and in these circumstances, the

        District Deputy Registrar was justified in     making the impugned

        8]       The recitals in the impugned order make reference to certain

        financial aid provided by the State Government to the society. The

        recitals also makes reference to Gazette Notifications as well as

        notices in the matter of appointment of Auditors by the society and

        the submission of timely audit reports at the intervals prescribed.

        The operative portion of the impugned order dated 12th May 2017

        states that the petitioner society, right from the date of inception,

        failed to appoint any auditor. The impugned order states that there

        has been no compliance on the part of the petitioner society of the

        directions for audit scheme of audit reports. There are also prima

        facie observations with regard to account of the aid / finances

        provided by the State Government to the society.



        9]       Section 81 of the MCS Act in the first instance, requires the

        societies shall cause to audit its accounts and submit such audit

        reports to the authorities prescribed. The proviso to section 81(1)

        failed to intimate and file returns as provided by sub section (2A) of

        section 75 and sub section (1B) of section 79, the Registrar may by

        order, for reasons to be recorded in writing, cause the accounts of

        approved by the State Government or an Authority authorized by it,

        in this behalf.

<p id="p_18">

        10]     There is really no      material     on record to accept the

        contentions of Mr. Sakhare as regards malafides or as regards

        compliance by the society of its legal obligation in the matter of

        audit of its accounts. A charge of malafides is easier made than

        made out. There is no allegation against any particular person or

        authority. No particular person or authority have been impleaded as

        parties in this petition. In the absence of all this, it is not possible to

        interfere with the impugned order on the grounds of legal malice or

        mala fides.
</p>
<p id="p_19">
        11]     There is also no reason      to dispute the statements in the

        recitals of the impugned orders. No material has been placed on

        record in support of the contention that auditors were appointed and

        timely audit reports were submitted. The provisions of Section 81

        confer ample powers upon the District Deputy Registrar to appoint

        test auditors in a situation of this nature. Accordingly, it cannot be

        said that the impugned order was in excess of jurisdiction. Further,

        the impugned order has already been worked out, in the sense, that

        the test auditors appointed in pursuance of the impugned order

        have already submitted their audit reports. Accordingly, there is no

        case made out to interfere with the impugned order.

        12]     The relief in terms of prayer clause B(1) proceeds on the

</pre><p id="p_20">        basis that the audit by the Test Auditor in terms of the impugned

        order dated 12th May 2017 is already complete. This relief is in the

        context of making available to the petitioner society the copy of the

        test audit report as well as further orders that may have been made

        on the test audit report.

<p id="p_21">
        13]     A writ petition under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution of

        India to merely seek a copy of the test audit report is not required

        to be entertained. The petitioners, have several alternate and

        efficacious remedy available to them. It is for the petitioners to avail

        of such remedies and in pursuance of such remedies to obtain the

        copies, if permissible under the law.

<p id="p_22">
        14]     The relief in terms of prayer clause B(2) is also entirely

        premature. In this regard, however, Mr. Sakhare submits that the

        provisions contained in Section 81(5B) of the MCS Act inter alia

        provide that where the auditor has come to a conclusion in his audit

        report that any person is guilty of any offence relating to the

        accounts or any other offences, he shall file a specific report to the

        Registrar within a period of 15 days from the date of submission of

        his audit report. The auditor concerned shall, after obtaining written

        permission of the Registrar, file a      first information report of the

        offence. The auditor who fails to file first information report shall be

        liable for      disqualification and his name should be liable to be

        removed from the panel of auditors and he shall also be liable to

        any other action as the Registrar may think fit.


        15]     Mr. Sakhare submits that before the auditor proceeds to file

        any FIR against the society or its board of directors, principles of

        natural justice would require that society and its board of directors

        are furnished the copy of his report. Mr. Sakhare submits that in

        terms of section 82 of the MCS Act, the society has opportunity to

        rectify the defects which are pointed out. Mr. Sakhare submits that

        if any FIR is filed before grant of opportunity to the society or its

        board of directors to rectify the defects pointed out in the audit

        report or before the society and its board of directors are provided

        with the test auditors report and any consequential orders made

        thereon by the Registrar or any other authority, initiation of any

        coercive action like institutions of FIR will violate the principles of

        natural justice.
</p>
<p id="p_23">
        16]     Mr. Sakhare has been unable to point out any provision or

        authority which requires compliance with principles of natural justice

        before lodging of FIR. In fact, in <a href="/doc/220229/" id="a_11">V. C. Shukla vs. State (Delhi

        Administration</a>)1, the Supreme Court has held that the question of

        an accused being heard prior to the commencement of prosecution

        does not arise. In cases where the law requires sanction to be

        given by the appointing authority before a prosecution can be

        launched against a government servant, it has never been

        suggested that the accused must be heard before the sanction is

        accorded or before any FIR is lodged. The question of sanction

        arises at a point of time when there is no danger to the liberty of the

        subject and the accused at that stage is not in the picture at all. It is

        only after sanction is accorded that an accused is brought to trial or

        proceedings are started against him when he is to bee heard and

        can challenge the validity of the sanction. Similarly, when a first

        information report is filed before a police officer, the law does not

        require that the officer must hear the accused before recording it or

        submitting a charge-sheet to the court.

        17]     Similarly, in <a href="/doc/116653184/" id="a_12">Anju Chaudhary vs. State of Uttar Pradesh &amp;

        Anr</a>.2, the Hon'ble Court after digesting several previous decisions

        The principles of natural justice have application, both in civil and

        crime.      It has      a twin purpose; firstly to adequately punish the

        offender in accordance with law and secondly, to ensure prevention

        of crime. On examination, the scheme<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_15"> of the Criminal Procedure

        Code</a>       does not provide for any right of hearing at the time of

        registration of the first information report. The very purpose of fair

        and just investigation shall stand frustrated if pre-registration

        hearing is required to be granted to a suspect. It is not that the

        liberty of an individual is being taken away or is being adversely

        18]     In any case, since the main challenge in the petition to the

        order dated 12th May 2017 fails, there is no necessity to go to other

        reliefs, which are, in the nature of ancillary reliefs in the petition.

        The petition, in a sense, is premature, because it proceeds on the

        basis that there will be no compliance on the part of the authorities
