    The petitioner is the judgment debtor in E.P.

No.363/15 in O.S. No.444/13 on the files of the Munsiff's

Court, Kannur. The above E.P. was filed for realising

an amount of Rs.3,27,384/- with 6% interest.              The

Execution Court proceeded to execute the decree

under Order XXI Rule 11, 54, 64 and 66 of the Code of

Civil Procedure against the immovable property of the

petitioner.   The petitioner contended that the ex

parte decree, which is sought to be executed is a

nullity as the summons was not duly served to him.

That apart, the upset price fixed by the court below is

very low and lesser than the actual market value of

the property.    According to him, the sale of 10.68

cents is not required to realise the decree amount.

After considering the said objection, the court below

rejected the objection and issued proclamation of

sale. This order is under challenge in this original

petition.
</p>
<p id="p_3">      2. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner

and the learned counsel for the respondent.

</p><p id="p_4">      3. Going by the materials on record, it is seen

that even though the petitioner has contended that the

upset price fixed by the Execution Court is less than

the actual market value of the property, no attempt

was made to substantiate the said contention before

the Execution Court.    In the absence of any other

material contrary to the contention raised by the

petitioner, the court below fixed the upset price on

the basis of the materials available on record.

Therefore, I cannot find fault with the court below and

there is no reason to interfere with the settlement of

proclamation.   Similarly, the executability of the

decree cannot be considered in an execution petition,

since such an enquiry goes behind the decree. Needless

to say, the scope and extent of consideration under

OP(C).1269/16                   :3:
</p>
<p id="p_5">


Section 47 of the C.P.C. are confined to execution,

discharge or satisfaction only.
</p>
<p id="p_6">      4. The learned counsel, at last, sought for some

time to pay the decree amount, by way of instalments.

The learned counsel for the respondent submits that a

reasonable time alone can be given to pay the decree

debt.
</p>
<p id="p_7">      5. Having regard to the said submission, the

petitioner is given six months' time to pay the decree

amount by six equal monthly instalments, payable

before the 10th of every month starting from 01.08.2016.

In the event of failure to pay any of the instalments in

time, this instalment facility will stand automatically

revoked and the Execution Court shall proceed with

the execution petition to realise the entire amount in

lump sum. On compliance of the said condition, further

proceedings in the execution petition shall be kept in

abeyance, till 10th day of sixth month.        But, the

Execution Court shall post the execution petition on

any day in between the 10th and the 15th of every month

so as to ascertain the payment of instalments.

</p><p id="p_9">      This original petition is disposed of accordingly.
