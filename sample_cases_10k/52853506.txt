JUDGMENT
</pre>

<p id="p_1">    1.                In   the   plaint,   it   is   stated   that   the   the   defendant   is   a 
           proprietorship concern of Sh. Yashpal, who approached the plaintiff 
           company for purchasing PPR pipes and fittings.  The plaintiff had sold 
           the goods to defendant vide bill no.107 dated 23.11.2011, bill no.147 
           dated   23.12.2011   and   bill   no.160   dated   06.01.2012.     Against   bill 
           no.107, the defendant issued a cheque dated 26.11.2011, which was

   not honoured and the defendant also did not make the payment.   As 
   per statement of account dated 31.03.2012, the defendant was liable 
   to   pay   Rs.1,57,015.71,   which   was   also   acknowledged   by   the 
   defendant, but he avoided to make the payment.  In November 2012, 
   the defendant refused to make the payment.   Legal notice was also 
   served on the defendant, but of no avail.  Hence, the present suit has 
   been filed for recovery of Rs.185,277.71 along with interest.   
</p>

<p id="p_2">2.           In   the   written   statement,   the   defendant   has   raised 
   objections stating that the plaintiff has suppressed the material facts; 
   that the plaintiff has no cause of action to file the present suit; that Sh. 
   Mangal Sain Sehgal has not been duly authorized to file the present 
   suit and that the plaintiff has received the entire payment.  
</p><p id="p_3">             It   is   stated   that   defendant   had   purchased   goods   worth 
   Rs.1,57,000/­ approximately and one Sh. Sudhir Malik, employee of 
   plaintiff company had received a sum of Rs.1.25 lac in cash from the 
   defendant and acknowledged the same in writing. It is also stated that 
   said Sh. Sudhir Malik received the remaining defective goods for an 
   amount of Rs.32,000/­ approximately.  Defendant states that the said 
   acknowledgment   has   been   misplaced   by   him.     Defendant   further 
   states that the plaintiff has received the entire payment and nothing is 
   to be paid by him. 
</p><p id="p_4">             Apart   from  this,   averments   made   in  the   plaint   have   been 
   denied praying that suit of the plaintiff may be dismissed with costs.

              instituted by duly authorized person? OPD 


</p><p id="p_12">8.           PW1, in his testimony, relied on the resolution passed in his 
favour as Ex.PW1/A.  The said resolution was passed in the meeting of 
Board   of   Directors   dated   22.01.2013,   authorizing   Sh.   Mangal   Sain 
Sehgal to sign the plaints and to depose as witness on behalf of plaintiff 
company.   Testimony   of   PW1   remained   unchallenged,   therefore,   the 
averments that he is the authorized representative of plaintiff company 
and is competent to institute the present suit, can be accepted as true.  In 
view   of   the   above   said,   it   is   held   that   suit   of   the   plaintiff   has   been 
instituted by a duly authorized person.

However, the defendant did not lead evidence in order to discharge the 
said burden.  Hence, for want of evidence in this regard, the said issue 
remained not proved and is decided accordingly.

purchased  goods of Rs.1,57,000/­  approximately  from the  plaintiff and 
one   Sh.   Sudhir   Malik,   authorized   representative   of   plaintiff   company,

defective   goods   of   Rs.32,000/­   approximately,   by   authorized 
representative   of   plaintiff   company,   remained   not   proved   as   the 
defendant did not lead evidence in this regard.

defendant failed to pay the amount despite service of the legal notice
