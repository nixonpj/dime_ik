JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">1.            As per the case of the prosecution on 25-3-2007, at

     about 2:00 p.m the complainant who is the mother of the

     prosecutrix went to take her daughter (prosecutrix) aged

     around 6 years who was playing at the third floor of the

     house where they used to live as a tenant.     The prosecutrix

     was playing with a boy named Nikhil who used to live in their

     adjacent room.   When the complainant        reached the third

                                                            Contd....
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                      2</span><p id="p_2">

     floor, she heard the cries of her daughter (prosecutrix)

     coming from the room of accused Ashok.           Complainant

     opened the door and found that accused had removed the

     panty of her daughter (prosecutrix)      and was trying      to

     commit rape upon her daughter (prosecutrix). Complainant

     raised an alarm. Many persons from the neighbourhood

     gathered there, accused Ashok was overpowered and police

     was informed accordingly.
</p>
<p id="p_3">2.           FIR bearing No. 214/2007 was registered at P.S. Tilak

     Nagar    and investigation went underway. After completion

     of investigation final report U/s 173 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_2">Cr.P.C</a> was prepared and

     was filed in the court of Metropolitan Magistrate who after

     completing all the formalities committed the case to the court

     of sessions for trial.
</p>
<p id="p_4">3.             After hearing the arguments on charge a primafacie

     case was made out to try the accused for the offence U/s

     376/511 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_3">IPC</a>. Accordingly, charge U/s 376/511 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_4">IPC</a>          was

     framed against the accused to which he pleaded not guilty

     and claimed trial.
</p>
<p id="p_5">                                                            Contd....
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                       3</span><p id="p_6">

</p><p id="p_7">4.             In the instant case, in order to prove its case, the

     prosecution examined only one witness Kiran as (PW 1) who

     was the neighbour of the complainant. She has not supported

     the case of the prosecution and turned hostile and nothing

     material could be extracted from her cross examination by

     the Ld. APP.
</p>
<p id="p_8">5.              The material witnesses in this case are the

     prosecutrix and her mother Urmila, but the prosecution

     has failed to examine both these material witnesses as

     they were untraceable.
</p>
<p id="p_9">6.             Various opportunities were given to the prosecution

     to produce the prosecutrix and her mother Urmila but to no

     effect. Statement of ASI Satpal (IO) has been recorded to

     this effect, who deposed that despite his best efforts both

     the said material witnesses could not be traced.

</p><p id="p_10">7.             As the prosecution has failed to produce the said

     material witnesses, the prosecution evidence was closed. As

     nothing     incriminating has come on record against the

     accused, his statement U/s 313 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_5">Cr.P.C</a>. was also dispensed

                                                            Contd....
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                       4</span><p id="p_11">

     with.
</p>
<p id="p_12">8.           I have heard the Ld.      APP for the state and the

     counsel for the accused.
</p>
<p id="p_13">9.           The prosecution has failed to examine the material

     witnesses i.e. prosecutrix and her mother Urmila as a result

     of which the prosecution has failed to prove its case.

</p><p id="p_14">10.          In view of the discussions herein above and in view of

     the fact that the the prosecution has failed to examine the

     material witnesses as a result of which nothing incriminating

     came on record against the accused, so the prosecution has

     failed to prove the charge against the accused. The accused is,

     therefore, acquitted.   File be consigned to Record Room.
