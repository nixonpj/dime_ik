              The present Misc bail application under <a href="/doc/1290514/" id="a_1">section 439</a>

Cr.P.C. is preferred by the Accused/ petitioner Wasim Akhtar in the

matter   of    FIR   No.   442/2016   registered   at    Police   Station

Anantpura, District Kota for offence punishable under <a href="/doc/92983/" id="a_2">Section 306</a>

IPC.

<p id="p_2">              Learned Counsel for petitioner Mr. Poonam Chand

Bhandari submits that from the statements of grandfather,

grandmother, and parents of deceased there was no dispute

between husband and wife. Police filed charge sheet only on the

basis of statements of Mohsin, Ashfaq brothers and Smt. Shama
                                (2 of 3)
                                                       [CRLMB-396/2017]

Praveen mother of deceased wherein it is stated that before the

alleged incident deceased sent whatsapp message to her brother

Ashfaq stating therein that petitioner gave beatings to her before

8-10 days and she is in tension. He submits that apart from these

three witnesses all family members of In-laws of petitioner didn't

levelled any allegation against the petitioner, petitioner is in

custody since 25.11.2016, investigation has been completed,

charge sheet has already been filed and trial shall take its own

time. He further submits that to constitute offence under <a href="/doc/92983/" id="a_3">Section

306</a> IPC there should be clear mensrea for abetment to suicide

enshrined in <a href="/doc/1667403/" id="a_4">Section 107</a> IPC which is lacking in this matter,

therefore petitioner may be released on bail.

</p><p id="p_3">           Learned Public Prosecutor Mr. Rajender Raghav and Mr.

Abdul Kalam Khan Learned Counsel appearing on behalf of

complainant opposed the bail application and submitted that since

petitioner gave beating to deceased before 8-10 days and

deceased sent whatsapp message to her brother Ashfaq wherein

she stated that Wasim gave her beating before 8-10 days and she

is in tension and she thinks that she should die, therefore the bail

application may be rejected.

</p><p id="p_5">           I have considered the submissions made at bar.


           On consideration of submissions made on behalf of

and the material made available for my perusal, therefore without

expressing any final opinion on the merit and de-merit of the case

and considering the overall facts and circumstances of the case
                                (3 of 3)
                                                       [CRLMB-396/2017]

specially considering the statements of parents of deceased her

grandfather and other witnesses, I am inclined to grant benefit of

bail to the accused-petitioner Wasim Akhtar.
