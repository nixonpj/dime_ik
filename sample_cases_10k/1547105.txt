JUDGMENT:
</pre><p id="p_1">J U D G M E N T
(Arising out of Special Leave Petition (Civil) No.882 of 2006)


G. P. MATHUR, J.
</p>

<p id="p_2">1.	Leave granted.
</p>

<p id="p_3">2.	This appeal, by special leave, has been preferred against the 
judgment and order dated 17.8.2005 of Delhi High Court, by which a 
direction was issued to the appellant Oriental Bank of Commerce to 
declare the respondents account as Non-Performing Asset (NPA) 
from 31st March, 2000 and to apply the Reserve Bank of India 
Guidelines to their case and communicate the outstandings which 
shall be recoverable by quarterly instalments over a period of two 
years.  
</p>
<p id="p_4">3.	The respondents Sunder Lal Jain &amp; another were sanctioned 
credit facility for Rs.20 lakhs on 12.12.1996. The respondent 
defaulted in repayment of the amount and their account was declared 
as NPA on 31.3.2001.   On 21.2.2002, the appellant Oriental Bank of 
Commerce filed a petition against the respondents being O.A. No.21 
of 2002 before the Debt Recovery Tribunal-III, Delhi  (for short the 
DRT).  The DRT passed a decree in favour of the appellant for 
recovery of Rs.20,27,862/- along with interest on 14.11.2003. The 
appellant initiated execution proceedings for recovery of the amount 
from the respondents and a recovery certificate was issued on 
8.12.2003.  The respondents did not file any appeal challenging the 
decree passed by the DRT.  Instead, the respondents filed WP(C) 
No.559 of 2005 and WP(C) No.560 of 2004 before Delhi High Court 
praying that a direction be issued to the appellant, Oriental Bank of 
Commerce, to declare their account as NPA from 31.3.2000 and apply 
RBI Guidelines for reconciliation and settling the accounts with them.  
The petitions were disposed of by a short order on 17.8.2005 which 
reads as under :-
</p><p id="p_5">	The petitioners have a remedy available to them 
of filing an appeal against the recovery proceedings to 
the DRT which remedy has not been taken and for which 
this petition is liable to be rejected.   However, since this 
petition has been pending for quite some time before this 
Court and the first Respondent has agreed to consider 
declaring the account as NPA from 31st March, 2000, 
there is no impediment in disposing of this petition by the 
following order :
</p>
<p id="p_6">	First Respondent-Bank is directed to declare the 
Petitioners account as NPA from 31st March, 2000 and 
apply the RBI guidelines to their case and then to 
communicate the outstandings, which shall be 
recoverable by quarterly instalments over a period of two 
years.
</p>
<p id="p_7">	In case, this course works out and Petitioners after 
reconciling their accounts do not commit any default, the 
execution proceedings against them pending before the 
Recovery Officer shall be stayed and the recovery 
certificate passed against them shall stand cancelled.  
However, in case of default it shall be open to the first 
Respondent-Bank to activate the recovery proceedings 
against them.  In that event, it shall be open to the 
Petitioners to take any appropriate remedy, which they 
may have against the recovery certificate or its execution 
in law.

	Feeling aggrieved by the above noted order, the appellant, 
Oriental Bank of Commerce, has preferred this appeal. 
</p>
<p id="p_8">4.	Learned counsel for the appellant has submitted that the bank 
had filed a suit for recovery of the amount and the same had been 
decreed on 14.11.2003 and thereafter a recovery certificate had also 
been issued on 8.12.2003 in the execution proceedings initiated by the 
appellant.  The respondents did not file any appeal to challenge the 
decree passed by the DRT and, therefore, the same attained finality.   
In these circumstances, the writ petition filed by the respondents to 
declare their account as NPA from 31.3.2000 and to apply the  
RBI guidelines to their case was not at all maintainable and the order 
passed by the High Court is clearly erroneous in law.  Learned 
counsel for the respondents has, on the other hand, tried to support the 
order passed by the High Court and has submitted that the same had 
been passed on consent of the parties and, therefore, it is not open to 
the appellant to challenge the same.  
</p>
<p id="p_9">	Regarding the submission of learned counsel for the 
respondents that the order under challenge has been passed on consent 
of the parties, it may be noted that the High Court has recorded that 
the first respondent has agreed to consider declaring the account as 
NPA from 31st March, 2000. Learned counsel for the appellant bank 
has vehemently submitted that no consent had been given by the 
counsel for the bank to declare the account as NPA from 31st March, 
2000, nor any such instructions had been given to the counsel by the 
appellant bank. That apart, the order of the High Court mentions has 
agreed to consider.  It only means that the bank will examine and 
consider. Consider means  to look at closely and carefully; to think 
or deliberate on; to take into account.  There was thus no consent on 
the part of the appellant bank to declare the account as NPA from 31st 
March, 2000.  A statement by a counsel for a party that his client will 
consider a particular suggestion given by the other side would not 
amount to a consent by the concerned party and an order passed on 
such a statement of the counsel cannot be said to be an order passed 
on consent.  It is, therefore, not possible to accept the contention 
raised by learned counsel for the respondents that the impugned order 
of the High Court has been passed on the consent of the appellant 
bank and consequently the present appeal is not maintainable. 
</p>
<p id="p_10">5.	Before considering the submission made by learned counsel for 
the parties on merits of the case, it is necessary to take note of the 
essential features of the revised guidelines issued by the Reserve Bank 
of India on January 29, 2003 regarding Non-Performing Assets of 
public sector banks which read as under :-
</p><p id="p_11">Revised guidelines for compromise settlement of chronic 
Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) of public sector banks

DBOD.BP.BC.65/21.04.117/2002-2003           January 29, 2003

Chairman and Managing Directors
of all Public Sector Banks.
</p>
<p id="p_12">Dear Sir,

Please refer to our circular DBOD.BP.BC.11/21.01.040/99-00 
dated 27th July, 2000, setting out the guidelines for compromise 
settlements of chronic NPAs up to Rs.5.00 crore.
</p>
<p id="p_13">2.	A review of compromise settlements of NPAs through 
the above scheme has revealed that the progress of recovery of 
NPAs through this mechanism has been moderate. In 
consultation with Government of India, it has been decided to 
give one more opportunity to the borrowers to come forward 
for settlement of their outstanding dues. Hence fresh guidelines 
are now issued, which will provide a simplified, non-
discretionary and non-discriminatory mechanism for 
compromise settlement of chronic NPAs below the prescribed 
value ceiling.   All public sector banks should uniformly 
implement these guidelines, so that maximum realization of 
dues is achieved from the stock of NPAs within the stipulated 
time.  
</p>
<p id="p_14">3.	............................................................................
</p>
<p id="p_15">(A)	Guidelines for compromise settlement
	of chronic NPAs upto Rs.10.00 crore
[i]	Coverage
</p><p id="p_16">a)	The revised guidelines will cover all NPAs in all sectors 
irrespective of the nature of business which have become 
doubtful or loss as on 31st March 2000 with outstanding balance 
of Rs.10.00 crore and below on the cut off date. 
</p>
<p id="p_17">b)	The guidelines will also cover NPAs classified as sub-
standard as on 31st March, 2000, which have subsequently 
become doubtful or loss.  
</p>
<p id="p_18">c)	These guidelines will cover cases on which the banks 
have initiated action under the Securitisation and 
Reconstruction of Financial Asses and <a href="/doc/198257891/" id="a_1">Enforcement of Security 
Interest Act</a>, 2002 and also cases pending before 
Courts/DRTs/BIFR, subject to consent decree being obtained 
from the Courts/DRTs/BIFR. 
</p>
<p id="p_19">d)	Cases of wilful default, fraud and malfeasance will not be 
covered. 
</p>
<p id="p_20">e)	The last date for receipt of applications from borrowers 
would be as at the close of business on 30th April, 2003.  The 
processing under the revised guidelines should be completed by 
31st October, 2003.
</p>
<p id="p_21">(ii)	Settlement Formula  amount and cut off date

</p><p id="p_22">a)	NPAs classified as Doubtful or Loss
	as on 31st March, 2000

The minimum amount that should be recovered under the 
revised guidelines in respect of compromise settlement of 
NPAs classified as doubtful or loss as on 31st March, 2000 
would be 100% of the outstanding balance in the account as on 
the date of transfer to the protested bills account or the amount 
outstanding as on the date on which the account was 
categorized as doubtful NPAs, whichever happened earlier, as 
the case may be;
</p>
<p id="p_23">b)	NPAs classified as sub-standard as on 31st March, 
2000 which became doubtful or loss subsequently.
</p>
<p id="p_24">The minimum amount that should be recovered in respect of 
NPAs classified as sub-standard as on 31st March, 2000 which 
became doubtful or loss subsequently would be 100% of the 
outstanding balance in the account as on the date of transfer to 
the protested bills account or the amount as on the date on 
which the account was categorized as doubtful NPAs, 
whichever happened earlier, as the case may be, plus interest at 
existing Prime Lending Rate from 1st April, 2000 till the date of 
final payment.
</p>
<p id="p_25">(iii)	Payment
The amount of settlement arrived at in both the above cases, 
should preferably be paid in one lump sum.   In cases where the 
borrowers are unable to pay the entire amount in one lump sum, 
at least 25% of the amount of settlement should be paid upfront 
and the balance amount of 75% should be recovered in 
instalments within a period of one year together with interest at 
the existing Prime Lending Rate from the date of settlement up 
to the date of final payment.
</p><p id="p_26">.....................................................................................

</p><p id="p_27">6.	A perusal of the aforesaid revised guidelines issued by the 
Reserve Bank of India on January 29, 2003 for compromise 
settlement of chronic Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) of public sector 
banks will show that the same will be applicable and will cover NPAs 
classified as sub-standard as on 31st March, 2000 which have 
subsequently become doubtful or loss.   The revised guidelines have 
no application where the NPAs have not been classified as sub-
standard as on 31st March, 2000.  It is not in dispute that the account 
of the respondents was a performing account between 1.4.2000 and 
31.3.2001. According to the records of the bank, the account was 
consigned to Protest Bill Account on 15.10.2001 and was declared as 
NPA as per prudential norms of RBI on 31.3.2001.  The respondents 
contested the case before the DRT and did not admit their liability.  
No such plea was raised that their account had become NPA as on 
31.3.2000 before DRT.  Therefore, the revised guidelines issued by 
Reserve Bank of India on January 29, 2003 for compromise 
settlement of chronic Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) of public sector 
banks were not at all applicable to the facts and circumstances of the 
case and no direction could be issued to declare the respondents 
account as NPA from 31st March, 2000.   The guidelines further 
provide that in case where borrowers are unable to pay the entire 
amount in lump sum, at least 25% of the amount of settlement should 
be paid upfront and the balance amount of 75% should be recovered 
in instalments within a period of one year together with interest.  The 
High Court, in the impugned order, has directed that the amount 
should be recovered by the appellant bank in quarterly instalments 
over a period of two years.  This is again contrary to the revised 
guidelines, which provide a period of one year only for recovery of 
the entire amount. 
</p>
<p id="p_28">7.	It is important to note that the revised guidelines issued by the 
Reserve Bank of India on January 29, 2003 are only in the nature of  
internal guidelines for the banks and financial institutions.   They are 
purely executive instructions and have no statutory force.  They do not 
create any right in favour of the borrowers.   In order to avail relief 
under the guidelines, the eligibility criteria must be strictly fulfilled 
and one of them is that the account must be an NPA as on 31st March, 
2000.   What the respondents want is that a writ of mandamus be 
issued commanding the appellant bank to declare the respondents 
account as NPA from 31st March, 2000 and apply the RBI Guidelines 
to their case whereby their liability towards the appellant bank will be 
considerably reduced by way of one time settlement.   
</p><p id="p_29">8.    The principles on which a writ of mandamus can be issued have 
been stated as under in The Law of Extraordinary Legal Remedies 
by F.G. Ferris and F.G. Ferris, Jr. :
</p><p id="p_30">Note 187-- Mandamus, at common law, is a highly 
prerogative writ, usually issuing out of the highest court 
of general jurisdiction, in the name of the sovereignty, 
directed to any natural person, corporation or inferior 
court within the jurisdiction, requiring them to do some 
particular thing therein specified, and which appertains to 
their office or duty. Generally speaking, it may be said 
that mandamus is a summary writ, issuing from the 
proper court, commanding the official or board to which 
it is addressed to perform some specific legal duly to 
which the party applying for the writ is entitled of legal 
right to have performed.
</p><p id="p_31">Note 192 --Mandamus is, subject to the exercise of a 
sound judicial discretion, the appropriate remedy to 
enforce a plain, positive, specific and ministerial duty 
presently existing and imposed by law upon officers and 
others who refuse or neglect to perform such duty, when 
there is no other adequate and specific legal remedy and 
without which there would be a failure of justice. The 
chief function of the writ is to compel the performance of 
public duties prescribed by statute, and to keep 
subordinate and inferior bodies and Tribunals exercising 
public functions within their jurisdictions. It is not 
necessary, however, that the duty be imposed by statute; 
mandamus lies as well for the enforcement of a common 
law duty.
</p><p id="p_32">Note 196-- Mandamus is not a writ of right. Its issuance 
unquestionably lies in the sound judicial discretion of the 
Court, subject always to the well-settled principles which 
have been established by the Courts. An action in 
mandamus is not governed by the principles of ordinary 
litigation where the matters alleged on one side and not 
denied on the other are taken as true, and Judgment 
pronounced thereon as of course. While mandamus is 
classed as a legal remedy, its issuance is largely 
controlled by equitable principles. Before granting the 
writ the Court may, and should, look to the larger public 
interest which may be concerned - an interest which 
private litigants are apt to over-look when striving for 
private ends. The Court should act in view of all the 
existing facts, and with due regard to the consequences 
which will result. It is in every case a discretion 
dependent upon all the surrounding facts and 
circumstances.
</p><p id="p_33">Note 206.--.......... The correct rule is that mandamus will 
not lie where the duty is clearly discretionary and the 
party upon whom the duty rests has exercised his 
discretion reasonably and within his jurisdiction, that is, 
upon facts sufficient to support his action.
</p><p id="p_34">9.    These very principles have been adopted in our country. <a href="/doc/146451/" id="a_2">In Bihar

Governing Body of the Nalanda College</a>, AIR 1962 SC 1210 and <a href="/doc/1906492/" id="a_5">Dr. 
Umakant Saran v. State of Bihar</a>, AIR 1973 SC 964, this Court 
observed as follows in paragraph 15 of the reports :
".......... There is abundant authority in favour of the 
proposition that a writ of mandamus can be granted only 
in a case where there is a statutory duty imposed upon the 
officer concerned and there is a failure on the part of the 
officer to discharge the statutory obligation. The chief 
function of a writ is to compel performance of public 
duties prescribed by statute and to keep subordinate 
Tribunals and officers exercising public functions within 
the limit of their jurisdiction. It follows, therefore, that in 
order that mandamus may issue to compel the authorities 
to do something, it must be shown that there is a statute 
which imposes a legal duty and the aggrieved party has a 
legal right under the statute to enforce its performance. 
......... In the instant case, it has not been shown by 
respondent No. 1 that there is any statute or rule having 
the force of law which casts a duty on respondents 2 to 4 
which they failed to perform. All that is sought to be 
enforced is an obligation flowing from a contract which, 
as already indicated, is also not binding and enforceable. 
Accordingly, we are clearly of the opinion that 
respondent No. 1 was not entitled to apply for grant of a 
writ of mandamus under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_6">Article 226</a> of the Constitution 
and the High Court was not competent to issue the 
same."
</p><p id="p_35">  	Therefore, in order that a writ of mandamus may be issued, 
there must be a legal right with the party asking for the writ to compel 
the performance of some statutory duty cast upon the authorities. The 
respondents have not been able to show that there is any statute or rule 
having the force of law which casts a duty on the appellant bank to 
declare their account as NPA from 31st March, 2000 and apply R.B.I. 
guidelines to their case. 
</p><p id="p_36">10.	The High Court, therefore, erred in issuing a writ of mandamus 
directing the appellant bank to declare the respondents account as 
NPA from 31st March, 2000 and to apply the RBI Guidelines to their 
case and communicate the outstandings which shall be recoverable by 
quarterly instalments over a period of two years.   The later part of the 
order passed by the High Court wherein a direction has been issued to 
stay the recovery proceedings and the recovery certificate issued 
against the respondents has been cancelled is also wholly illegal as the 
decree passed by the DRT had attained finality and proceedings for 
execution of decree could not be stayed in an independent writ 
petition when the respondents had not chosen to assail the decree by 
filing an appeal, which is a statutory remedy provided under <a href="/doc/1393354/" id="a_7">Section 
20</a> of Recovery of Debts Due to Banks and Financial Institutions Act, 
1993.
</p>
<p id="p_37">11.	In view of the discussions made above, the appeal is allowed 
and the impugned judgment and order dated 17.8.2005 passed by the 
High Court is set aside.  The appellant will be entitled to its costs.
