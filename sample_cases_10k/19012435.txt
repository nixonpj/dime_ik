     THIS WRIT PETITION COMING ON FOR PRELIMINARY
HEARING, THIS DAY THE COURT MADE THE FOLLOWING:
                                     2


                                ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">      The petitioner has challenged the legality of the

order dated 17.02.2014, passed by the Industrial

Tribunal, Bangalore, whereby the learned Tribunal has

allowed the application filed by the N.E.K.R.T.C. under

<a href="/doc/535397/" id="a_1">Section 33(2)(b)</a> of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947

('Act' for short).
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">2.    Briefly,    the    facts     of   the   case    are   that    on

02.07.1990, the petitioner was appointed as a Driver-

cum-Conductor           with      the     respondent-Corporation.

During the course of service, on 07.03.2012, he was

dismissed    from       his    service.       The    petitioner    had

challenged his dismissal before the Labour Court,

Gulbarga,    in   KID         No.38/2012.       By     order      dated

25.09.2012, the Labour Court dismissed the dispute.

However, as ID No.148/2005 was pending before the

Industrial     Tribunal,        Bangalore,      the     respondent-

Corporation had filed an application under <a href="/doc/210468/" id="a_2">Section 33(2)</a>

</p><p id="p_4">(b) of the Act for approval of the order of dismissal

passed by the respondent-Corporation.                   In order to

substantiate      the          application,    the      respondent-
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                 3</span>


Corporation examined two witnesses, and submitted

five documents. However, the petitioner, after receiving

the notice, merely filed his objection, but did not contest

the   application      by   appearing     before   the   learned

Tribunal.      Therefore, by the impugned order, the

learned     Tribunal    allowed     the   application    of   the

respondent-Corporation filed under <a href="/doc/210468/" id="a_3">Section 33(2)</a> (b) of

the Act. Hence, the present petition before this Court.


</p><p id="p_5">3.    Mr. M. C. Basavaraju, the learned counsel for the

petitioner, has strenuously, argued that the petitioner

should have been given a chance to contest the

application.   Therefore, the case should be remanded to

the learned Tribunal.       However, he has conceded, and

in view of this Court rightly so, that it is true that the

petitioner had filed his objection and had initially

appeared through a Counsel, but later on did not

contest the application.       Once the said admission is

made, the learned counsel for the petitioner cannot be

allowed to claim that an opportunity of hearing should

be provided to the petitioner by the learned Tribunal.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                             4</span>


</p><p id="p_6">4.    A bare perusal of the impugned order clearly

reveals the charges leveled against the petitioner were

that he had     mis-appropriated    the   monies   of   the

respondent-Corporation.     A   thorough     departmental

enquiry was carried out, wherein the petitioner was

given ample opportunities to defend himself.        Since,

the Enquiry Officer had found the petitioner guilty of the

mis-conduct, the petitioner's services were terminated

by order dated 07.03.2012.      Although the said order

was challenged before the Labour Court, Gulbarga, the

claim statement was rejected.      Thus, according to the

learned Tribunal, ample opportunities have been given

to the petitioner to defend his case before the Labour

Court and even before the learned Tribunal opportunity

was given to the petitioner to contest the application

filed by the respondent-Corporation.         But for the

reasons best known to the petitioner, he chose not to

contest the same.      Therefore, no further opportunity

can be given to the petitioner by this Court. After all, it

is a settled position of law that a litigant who is lax in

defending his right, cannot subsequently claim that he
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                             5</span>


was denied the opportunity of hearing. It was the duty

of the petitioner to defend his right and to contest the

application. In case he has slept over his rights, the

petitioner has himself to blame.
</p>
<p id="p_7">
</p><p id="p_8">5.    For the reasons stated above, this Court does not

find any illegality or perversity in the impugned order.

The petition, being devoid of merit, is hereby dismissed.
