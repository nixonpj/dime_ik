<p id="p_1">For Petitioner             :      Shri H.B. Agrawal, Sr. Adv. with Ms. Itu Rani

05/02/2018

</p><p id="p_2">   1. Heard.
</p>
<p id="p_3">
</p><p id="p_4">   2. The present petition is against the order dated 17.12.2017 passed by the

       Civil Judge, Class-I, Akaltara, District Janjgir-Champa in Civil Suit No.73-

       A/2015, whereby the application for amendment of the plaint has been

       rejected on the ground that the application of the plaintiff is so vague and

       the plaintiff himself is not able to substantiate the fact whether he is in

       possession or not. Consequently, since the claim has been made after 12

       years, therefore, the application to claim the possession is dismissed.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                              2</span>

</p><p id="p_5">       3. Perusal of the order in entirety would show that the order itself appears to

          be contradictory as on the one part the Court has observed that it is the

          submission of the plaintiff that he is in possession, therefore, no possession

          decree is necessary, however, in the other part the relief projected is that

          alternative possession has been claimed. In any case taking the stage of

          trial, as it appears that the evidence has not yet started and if the proposed

          amendment is disallowed then in such case, the plaintiff would be barred to

          claim any relief under Order 2 Rule 2 CPC, which may have a disastrous

          effect without giving any chance to place the case by way of pleading &amp;

          evidence to the plaintiff. Allowing the amendment ipso facto do not lead to

          acceptance of the case of the plaintiff and it would be on the plaintiff to lead

          evidence to prove the facts and if the relief is not permissible under the law,

          the same can always be denied.
</p>
<p id="p_6">       4. The application wherein the plaintiff has claimed the amendment seeking

          possession it can only be considered at the stage of final hearing after

          evidence &amp; facts are on record.        The proposed amendment cannot be

          thrown at the threshold as it may lead to multiplicity of the proceeding and

          suppressing the right to plead the case. In view of the same, order dated

          07.12.2017 is set aside. The relief claimed by the application to amend the

          plaint is allowed.   The necessary amendment be carried out within two

          weeks and court fees accordingly may be paid claiming possession.

          Defendants are also allowed to make consequential amendments to their

          written statement.

<p id="p_7">       5. Accordingly, the writ petition stands allowed.
