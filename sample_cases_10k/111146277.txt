12/12/2017

</p><p id="p_14">   1. Heard on the question of admission of these writ petitions and on

      the application for grant of interim relief.

</p><p id="p_15">   2. Since common question of law and fact is involved in these three

      writ petitions, they were clubbed together and heard analogously

      and are being disposed of by this common order.

</p><p id="p_16">   3. The Municipal Corporation, Raipur, granted lease of shops

      admeasuring 80 sq.ft., Opposite Khalsa School, Raipur to these

      writ petitioners by lease agreement under the Swavalamban

      Yojana. As stated by learned counsel for respondent No.2, the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                  3</span>

  petitioners' lease has been terminated by order dated 11-12-2017.

  In the meanwhile, the Government has taken a policy decision to

  develop Oxy Zone to conserve and preserve environment, in the

  ESI Colony and nearby area and for developing the said area as

  Oxy Zone, feeling the requirement of shops held by the petitioners,

  the petitioners were served with notices dated 29-5-2017 to vacate

  the premises within three days led to filing of writ petitions by these

  three writ petitioners questioning legality and validity of those

  notices dated 29-5-2017.      This Court by order dated 9-8-2017

  permitted the Municipal Corporation, Raipur to withdraw the notice

  dated 29-5-2017 with liberty to proceed in accordance with law and

  to examine the individual cases. The Municipal Corporation, now,

  by the impugned notices dated 30-11-2017 having decided to

  rehabilitate the petitioners at Bhanpuri Ring Road No.2 in the

  vacant shops constructed under the Mukhyamantri Swavalamban

  Yojana, directed them to appear before the Commissioner,

  Municipal Corporation, Raipur on 4-12-2017 for drawl of lottery to

  allot shops. However, the petitioners did not appear before the

  said authority and have filed these writ petitions challenging the

  notices dated 30-11-2017 and calling in question the decision of

  the Government to develop Oxy Zone stating that developing the

  area as Oxy Zone is contrary to law and the impugned notices

  dated 30-11-2017 be quashed.
</p>
<p id="p_17">4. Mr. Sudeep Johri, learned counsel appearing for the petitioners,

  would vehemently submit that the impugned decision of the

  Government is contrary to law, as the proper procedure envisaged
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                       4</span>

       under the Chhattisgarh Municipal Corporation Act, 1956 has not

       been followed and the livelihood of the petitioners will be affected if

       they are evicted from the land in question therefore, the Municipal

       Corporation and the State Government be restrained from evicting

       the petitioners from the suit premises and a protective order be

       granted, as shops to be allotted at Bhanpuri are in the outskirts of

       Raipur city and the petitioners will suffer and they have no business

       prospect at that place. Mr. Johri relied upon the decisions of the

       Supreme Court in the matters of <a href="/doc/192605638/" id="a_1">Banatwala and Company v. Life

       Insurance Corporation of India</a> and another 1, <a href="/doc/1644077/" id="a_2">ITC Limited v.

<p id="p_18">    5. Mr. Dhiraj Kumar Wankhede, learned Government Advocate

       appearing on behalf of the State of Chhattisgarh, and Mr. Pankaj

       Agrawal, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the Municipal

       Corporation, Raipur, would submit that the petitioners have earlier

       filed writ petitions questioning the notice of the Corporation dated

       29-5-2017 and the Municipal Corporation was permitted to

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                  5</span>

  withdraw the said notice with liberty to proceed in accordance with

  law and now, the cases of the petitioners have been examined and

  finding that their rehabilitation is must and in order to rehabilitate

  them only on humanitarian and compassionate ground, the

  Corporation has decided to rehabilitate the petitioners by providing

  the vacant shops at Bhanpuri Ring Road No.2 and has incurred ₹

  20 lakhs in repairing the shops in order to bring them in proper

  condition and they have been directed to appear for getting the

  necessary formalities to be done and for vacating the subject

  shops, but they did not appear before the said authority and have

  filed writ petitions. They would further submit that the petitioners'

  lease has already been terminated by orders dated 11-12-2017

  and that is not the subject matter of challenge in these writ petitions

  as such, the petitioners' lease stood determined as on this date

  therefore they have no legal right to continue on the suit premises.

  They would also submit that the petitioners are not entitled to

  question the order of the State Government developing an area as

  Oxy Zone, as it is purely an administrative decision of the

  Government and therefore the petitioners have no locus to

  challenge the same in these writ petitions and they are at liberty to

  challenge the same in appropriate proceedings, if they feel so, and

  as such, the writ petitions deserve to be dismissed.

</p><p id="p_19">6. I have heard learned counsel for the parties and considered their

  rival submissions made herein-above and also gone through the

  records with utmost circumspection.
</p>
<p id="p_20">7. Undisputedly, the petitioners have earlier filed writ petitions
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                     6</span>

     questioning the notices dated 29-5-2017 issued by the Municipal

     Corporation, Raipur and the Municipal Corporation was permitted

     to withdraw the said notices with liberty to proceed strictly in

     accordance with law and to examine the individual cases.

     According to the Corporation, now the cases of the petitioners have

     been examined and in order to rehabilitate them, they are being

     allotted vacant shops at Bhanpuri Ring Road No.2 for which they

     were asked to come to the office of the Corporation for drawl of

     lottery, but they did not appear and it appears that they are not

     interested in the rehabilitation of their shops at Bhanpuri Ring Road

     No.2   i.e.   the   vacant   shops   constructed   also   under   the

     Mukhyamantri Swavalamban Yojana.          Their lease had already

     been terminated by orders dated 11-12-2017 and that is not the

     subject matter of challenge in these writ petitions as such, the

     petitioners' lease stood determined as on this date therefore they

     have no legal right to continue on the suit premises, however, in all

     fairness, the Municipal Corporation has decided to rehabilitate

     them at Bhanpuri Ring Road No.2.
</p>
<p id="p_21">  8. The Supreme Court in the matter of <a href="/doc/1910017/" id="a_7">Jaswantsingh Mathurasingh

     and another v. Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation and others</a> 7

     has clearly held that a lease creates right or an interest in

     enjoyment of the demised property and a tenant or a sub-tenant is

     entitled to remain in possession of the demised property until the

     lease is duly terminated and eviction takes place in accordance

     with law. Thereafter, the Supreme Court looking to long stay of the

     tenant therein, has held him entitled for alternative premises by
7 1992 Supp (1) SCC 5
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                      7</span>

   holding as under: -
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">         "16. It is seen that the appellant has been in
         possession as tenant for well over half a century and,
         therefore, it is injuriously affected by the scheme which
         has the effect of terminating his possession and this
         adversely affects its business in the demised premises.
         Since it is a running business over the years, the
         respondent is directed to provide an alternative
         premises by allotting a suitable shop within the city to
         the appellant; to put it in possession thereof and until
         then allow its occupation of demised shop. In case the
         appellant does not vacate or creates any obstruction in
         any form in the matter of possession, it would be open
         to the respondent to have the appellant ejected
         summarily. In this view we decline to interfere with the
         scheme. The appeal is accordingly allowed to the
         above extent and in other respects the decree of the
         courts below is upheld. But in the circumstances
         parties are directed to bear their own costs."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_22">9. Reverting back to the facts of the present case, the Municipal

   Corporation finding that the petitioners' eviction is likely to affect

   their livelihood, if they are evicted and uprooted without providing

   them alternative suit in the Raipur town, as they are staying at the

   present place for last ten years, decided to rehabilitate them at

   Bhanpuri Ring Road No.2, Raipur which is strictly in accordance

   with law and as held by the Supreme Court in Jaswantsingh

   Mathurasingh (supra). Apart from this, their lease has also been

   determined     by   order    dated    11-12-2017      by    the   Municipal

   Corporation, Raipur and they have not questioned the same in

   these writ petitions. As such, the order Annexure P-1 granting the

   relief of rehabilitation is in favour of the petitioners.

</p><p id="p_23">10. So far as challenge of the petitioners to developing the area as Oxy

   Zone to conserve the environment is concerned, the petitioners in

   these writ petitions are not entitled to lay challenge to it, as it is a

   purely Government's policy decision to develop an area as Oxy
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                      8</span>

      Zone and the petitioners are at liberty to challenge the same in

      other appropriate jurisdiction in accordance with law, but they

      cannot be held to be the persons aggrieved to seek an appropriate

      writ in these writ petitions while laying challenge to the notices

      dated 30-11-2017, as they have no legal right to question the said

      decision of the respondent and failed to establish the infringement

      of their legal right as their issue of eviction and question of

      rehabilitation have already been addressed by the respondents

      granting rehabilitation to the petitioners.     (See Calcutta Gas

      Company (Prop.) <a href="/doc/124471899/" id="a_8">Ltd. v. State of West Bengal</a> and others 8

      and <a href="/doc/1553344/" id="a_9">Bar Council of Maharashtra v. M.V. Dhabolkar</a> and

      others9.)

</p><p id="p_24">  11. As held, the notices / orders dated 30-11-2017 are in favour of the

      petitioners which they cannot challenge particularly in view of the

      fact that these writ petitioners have earlier filed writ petitions only

      challenging the notices dated 29-5-2017 and when their cases

      have been examined individually and they have been granted the

      relief of rehabilitation, now, they have improved their case and

      again filed writ petitions challenging the development of a particular

      area as Oxy Zone which they are not entitled to challenge by way

      of these writ petitions, as they have no locus to challenge the

      Governmental decision while laying challenge to the impugned

      notice Annexure P-1.
</p>
<p id="p_25">  12. Thus, I do not find any merit in the writ petitions, the writ petitions

      deserve to be and are accordingly dismissed. However, it is made

8 AIR 1962 SC 1044
9 AIR 1975 SC 2092
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                        9</span>

       clear that the petitioners' right to get the shops at Bhanpuri Ring

       Road No.2 is not closed on dismissal of writ petitions and they can

       pursue the matter with the Municipal Corporation, Raipur and in

       turn, the Municipal Corporation is obliged to rehabilitate them in the

       vacant shops at Bhanpuri Ring Road No.2 as per Annexure P-1 for

       which four weeks' time is extended for the petitioners for their

       appearance for drawl of lottery. If they approach, they shall be

       rehabilitated as per Annexure P-1 expeditiously so that they can

       settle down and start earning their livelihood without further loss of

       time. No order as to cost(s).
