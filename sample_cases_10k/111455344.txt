                                    2     O.S. No. 25375 / 2017

                           JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">      The plaintiff Bank has filed this suit against the defendant

for recovery of money of Rs.3,19,927.94/- with future interest at

the rate of 18% per annum, contending that, the defendant

approached the plaintiff bank for financial assistance of

Rs.2,53,775/- as personal loan and after considering the

application the defendant was sanctioned/disbursed loan of

Rs.2,53,775/- on 27.08.2015 repayable in EMIs till the entire

loan amount was cleared.           The defendant has accepted the

terms of loan sanction and executed loan agreement, loan forms,

in favour of the plaintiff bank.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">      2)     The defendant after availing the loan failed to pay

EMIs on the due dates. Despite several requests and reminders,

the defendant failed to repay the loan amount, as agreed by her.

Therefore, the plaintiff has constrained to issue loan recall notice

on 24.11.2016 and as on the date of this suit, the defendant was

due to the plaintiff bank a total        sum of Rs.3,19,927.94/-.

Hence, this suit.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                 3       O.S. No. 25375 / 2017</span><p id="p_4">

</p><p id="p_5">        3)    After registration of this suit, suit summons were

issued to the defendant. Inspite of service of summons on the

defendant, she did not turn up. Hence, defendant was placed

exparte and this case was posted for evidence of the plaintiff

bank.
</p>
<p id="p_6">
</p><p id="p_7">        4)    The plaintiff bank in order to prove its case, got

filed the Affidavit of its Legal Manager Mr. Vishal Shukla, by

way of examination-in-chief. Same was taken as PW1 and got

marked Exs.P1 to P7 documents and closed the evidence of the

plaintiff bank.
</p>
<p id="p_8">
</p><p id="p_9">        5)    Heard the arguments of the learned counsel for the

plaintiff.
</p>
<p id="p_10">
</p><p id="p_11">        6)    The Points that would arise for the consideration of

this court are as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">        (1) Whether the plaintiff bank proves that, on
            27.8.2015,     the   defendant     borrowed
            Rs.2,53,775/- from plaintiff bank as personal
            loan agreeing to repay the same in EMIs
            with interest at 18% p.a.?
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">        (2) Whether the plaintiff bank proves that, it is
            entitled to recover the suit claim amount of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                   4       O.S. No. 25375 / 2017</span>

            Rs.3,19,927.94/- from the defendant with
            future interest?
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">      (3) What order or decree?
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">       7)    My findings to the above Points are as follows:

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_6">             Point No.1: In the affirmative

             Point No.2: In the affirmative

             Point No.3: For the following:</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_7">

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_8">                            REASONS

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_9">       8)    POINT NOS.1 AND 2:-             PW1 in his Affidavit

evidence has reiterated and re-affirmed the contents of the plaint

averments and got marked Exs.P1 to P7 documents.


</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_10">       9)    In this case, the defendant was placed exparte.

</blockquote><p id="p_12">Thus, it is crystal clear that, the defendant has not at all placed

any contrary materials on record to discard or disbelieve the case

of the plaintiff bank. If at all the case of the plaintiff bank is not

correct, the defendant would have definitely appeared before the

court in order to contest the case of the plaintiff, but, she has not

done so and she remained absent before the court. The absence

of the defendant before the court itself clearly goes to show that,

she has admitted the claim of the plaintiff bank.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                 5      O.S. No. 25375 / 2017</span>

</p><p id="p_13">      10)    On perusal of the documentary evidence produced

by the plaintiff bank at Ex.P2 the Preliminary Credit facility

application form for personal loan, which goes to show that the

defendant has applied for sanction of loan of Rs.2,53,775/- with

the plaintiff bank. Ex.P3 credit facility application form

executed by the defendant in favour of the bank. Ex.P4 is the

terms and conditions letter, Ex.P5 is the account statement in

respect of the defendant maintained by the Bank, Ex.P6 is the

prepayment of loan account and Ex.P7 is the Loan Recall notice.

From the above documents, it is crystal clear that, the defendant

availed loan of Rs.2,53,775/- from the plaintiff bank, agreeing to

repay the said loan amount in EMIs. The defendant while

availing loan of Rs.2,53,775/- from the plaintiff bank has agreed

to the terms and conditions of the loan availed by her and

executed the aforementioned necessary documents in favour of

the plaintiff Bank for having borrowed the loan. But, after

availing the said loan, the defendant has failed to repay the said

loan amount as agreed by her. The plaintiff bank by issuing loan

recall notice has demanded the defendant to repay the

outstanding due to the plaintiff bank. Thus, the plaintiff bank
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                   6       O.S. No. 25375 / 2017</span>

has proved that, the defendant had availed loan of Rs.2,53,775/-

on 27.08.2015 from it agreeing to repay the said sum in EMIs

and the defendant has executed necessary loan documents, as

narrated above, in favour of the plaintiff bank.            But, the

defendant, as agreed by them failed to repay the loan amount to

the plaintiff bank, despite issuance of notice to the defendant.

Hence, as on the date of the suit the defendant was due to pay a

sum of Rs.3,19,927.94/- to the plaintiff Bank. Therefore the

plaintiff bank is proved that the defendant has availed loan of

Rs.2,53,775/- from it. Hence, I am of the view that, the plaintiff

bank is entitled to recover the            suit claim amount of

Rs.3,19,927.94/- from the defendants.
</p>
<p id="p_14">
</p><p id="p_15">       11)   The plaintiff bank has sought for future interest at

the rate of 18% per annum. By taking into consideration that

the huge suit claim amount, I am of the considered view that, if

future interest at the rate of 18% per annum is awarded, it will

over-burden the defendant. Therefore, I am of the considered

view that, the plaintiff is entitled to future interest at the rate of

12% per annum. Hence, the plaintiff bank is not entitled to the

future interest at the rate of 18% per annum as claimed in the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                 7       O.S. No. 25375 / 2017</span>

suit but it is entitled to future interest at 12% p.a. Therefore, I

answer Point Nos. 1 and 2 in the affirmative.


</p><p id="p_16">      12)    POINT NO.3:-       In view of the aforesaid reasons

on Point Nos.1 and 2, I proceed to pass the following:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_11">                               ORDER
      Suit of the plaintiff bank is decreed with costs.</blockquote><p id="p_17">

</p><p id="p_18">      2) The defendant is hereby directed to pay a sum of

Rs.3,19,927.94/- [Rupees three lakh nineteen thousand nine

hundred and twenty seven and paise ninety four only] to the

plaintiff bank with future interest at the rate of 12% per

annum from the date of filing of the present suit till the date

of realization of the decreetal amount.
</p>
<p id="p_19">      3) Draw decree accordingly.
