                        HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE ASHWANI KUMAR SINGH

                                              ORAL ORDER</pre>

<p id="p_1">            (Per: HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE NAVANITI PRASAD SINGH)
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">      Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.473 of 2008 (7) dt.27-02-2012</span>




7   27-02-2012                      When this batch of appeals was about to be taken up for

                  hearing Mr. Shravan Kumar, learned Senior counsel appears in Cr. App.

                  (DB) Nos. 404/2008 and 409/2008 pointed out that in both these appeals on

                  behalf of the sole appellant plea of juvenility has been raised. In support of

                  appellant Manish Kumar the plea of juvenility is based upon matriculation

                  certificate issued by the Bihar School Examination Board to show that his

                  date of birth is 10 th June 1983. The certificate no. is 98A-C-073677 issued

                  on 21st December 1998, accordingly, it is submitted that this appellant

                  Manish Kumar would be about 16 ½ years. In respect of appellant Chandan

                  Kumar, he has placed reliance on School Leaving Certificate of Sarhadi

                  Gandhi Suryadeo Uchch Vidyalaya, Madhuban, P.O. - Pakri, District -

                  Muzaffarpur, dated 12.10.1999, in which his date of birth is shown to be

                  12.05.1985 which would make him about 15 ½ years on the date of

                  occurrence. Both have also annexed reports of the medical board which were

                  duly constituted by orders of the Chief Judicial Magistrate, in which, again,

                  on the date of occurrence both have been found to be minors. The medical

                  report is dated 19.01.2002.
</p>
<p id="p_2">                                    In our view, before we proceed to hear all these five appeals

                  on merit in view of the plea of juvenility raised the matter has to be inquired

                  into by the Juvenile Justice Board, Muzaffarpur as per provisions of Juvenile

                  Justice (Care &amp; <a href="/doc/1973522/" id="a_1">Protection of Children) Act</a>, 2001 and the Bihar and Central

                  Rules framed thereunder. This would require an inquiry to be conducted by

                  the Board first. The board would be required to get the matriculation

                  certificate examined by the authorities of the Bihar School Examination

                  Board in all particulars. If, that is found to be correct, then no further

                  evidence would be required in case of Manish Kumar. The Board would be
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">    Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.473 of 2008 (7) dt.27-02-2012</span>




                required to notice the School authorities who have granted the transfer

                certificate in respect of Chandan Kumar and direct them to produce

                authentic original admission register and other records of the school in

                which date of birth was first recorded in respect of that appellant. Then

                considering all these aspects and the medical report which is of a Board

                constituted pursuant to the orders of the Chief Judicial Magistrate,

                Muzaffarpur. The board would come to an independent finding in this

                regards without being prejudiced by any other order or orders of any

                authority or court, as it is their independent jurisdiction in the matter.

</p><p id="p_3">                                  The Registry of this court would accordingly send a

                certified photocopy of I.A. No. 1486/2010 filed on behalf of the Manish

                Kumar in Cr. App. (DB) No. 404/2008 and I.A. No. 2405/2010 filed on

                behalf of Chandan Kumar in Cr. App. (DB) No. 409/2008 to the Juvenile

                Justice Board, Muzaffarpur along with a copy of this order for necessary

                action and sending report to this court expeditiously.

</p><p id="p_4">                                  All these appeals would be taken up for hearing only after

                receipt of report.</p><pre id="pre_2">
