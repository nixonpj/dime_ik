</blockquote><p id="p_3">3.           Remaining investigation completed by Inspector Shri B.S.

Rajput who sent the contraband samples to FSL Sagar for chemical

examination, recorded the statements of witnesses and after due

completion submitted the challan.
</p>
<p id="p_4">4.           The learned trial Court framed the charge against

appellant for commission of offence punishable under <a href="/doc/704277/" id="a_7">Section 8</a>/<a href="/doc/919170/" id="a_8">20</a> of

the Act. The appellant pleaded not guilty, therefore, he was put to trial.

The prosecution examined twelve witnesses and produced documents

Ex.P/1 to Ex.P/36.
</p>
<p id="p_5">5.           During statement under <a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_9">Section 313</a> of Cr.P.C., the

appellant denied all the evidence putforth against him and pleaded his

innocence on the ground that he was falsely implicated. However, no

defence witness has been examined.
</p>
<p id="p_6">6.           The learned trial Court, after appreciating the evidence

available on record, has held the appellant guilty under <a href="/doc/704277/" id="a_10">Section 8</a>/<a href="/doc/919170/" id="a_11">20</a> of
                                      4                           Cr.A.670/2010
the Act and sentenced him, as mentioned herein above, against which,

this appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_7">7.             Shri Raman Patel, learned counsel for the appellant

submitted that the independent witnesses completely hostile and

learned trial Court convicted the appellant on the statement of police

officer, Shri Patel, which is bad in law. It is also submitted that the

place from where the contraband seized is an open place being a

Dhaba, customers were regularly come there, in such a situation, it

cannot be said that the contraband was seized from the exclusively

possession of the appellant.      Lastly, it is submitted that mandatory

provisions of <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_12">Sections 50</a>, <a href="/doc/1609866/" id="a_13">51</a>, <a href="/doc/1294540/" id="a_14">52</a>, <a href="/doc/669884/" id="a_15">57</a> and <a href="/doc/1841395/" id="a_16">42</a> of NDPS Act were not

complied with, therefore, the conviction of the appellant is to be set

aside.
</p>
<p id="p_8">8.             Per contra, Ms. Hemlata Kshatriya, learned Panel Lawyer

appearing for the State has opposed the appeal and submitted that

appellant has rightly been convicted believing the testimony of the

prosecution witnesses. The finding, so recorded by the learned trial

Court, does not call for an interference by this Court, thus, this appeal

is liable to be dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_9">9.             I have considered the rival submissions made by learned

counsel for the parties, perused the impugned judgment and entire

available record carefully.
</p>
<p id="p_10">10.            A.S.I. Shri Patel (PW/10) stated that on receiving telephonic

information that the appellant is dealing in contraband and on pursuing to

this information, he and members of raiding party reached to the Dhaba of

the appellant, which was situated Chaka Bye-pass Triangle. He further

stated in presence of independent witnesses Janak (PW/2) and Raju
                                       5                                Cr.A.670/2010
Yadav (PW/3) it was confirmed that he is appellant Radheshyam and

thereafter the appellant apprised about information against him. It is also

stated by Shri Patel (PW/10) that the members of raiding party offered

search of themselves, which appellant conducted and thereafter the

Dhaba and Betel Tapara were searched in presence of independent

witnesses Mahendra @ Mannu (PW/5) and Ajay (PW/6). Shri Patel

(PW/10) stated that a gunny bag was found in Betel Tapara and

contraband substance found in a Gunny bag. Amarnath Shukla (PW/1) is

the owner of the grosser shop from where the investigation officer brought

the weighing means and after weighing contraband was found 13 kg 600

gms.
</p>
<p id="p_11">11.            During this search and seizure proceedings Shri Patel

(PW/10) prepared      following documents in presence of independent

witnesses Mahendra @ Mannu (PW/5) and Ajay Kumar Yadav

(PW/6):-

</blockquote><p id="p_12">12.           It is pertinent to mention here that not only Janak (PW/2)

and Raju Yadav (PW/3) were declared hostile but important witnesses

Mahendra @ Mannu (PW/5) and Ajay (PW/6) were also declared

hostile because they did not support a single word regarding above

mentioned proceedings of Shri Patel (PW/10).

</p><p id="p_13">13.           The fact that four witnesses called from amongst the

members of the public including Mahendra @ Mannu (PW/5) and Ajay

Kumar (PW/6) had turned hostile, but their evidence could not

destroyed the prosecution case or makes it doubtful. The mere fact that

remaining witnesses i.e. Shri Patel (PW/10) and Shri Bundela Singh

Dwivedi (PW/4) are police officers is not enough to discard their

evidence, when no reason to show for their hostility towards the

appellant. But, in such a situation marshaling of these police officers'

evidence requires very high degree of scrutiny and each and every

contradiction, omission, new fact, etc. will be fatal for the prosecution.

</p><p id="p_14">14.           Shri Patel (PW/10) admitted this fact that at the time of

incident he was posted as ASI and also denied this suggestion that ASI is

not authorized for the investigation under the <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_18">NDPS Act</a>. Ignoring this fact,

it is also pertinent to mention here that Shri Patel (PW/10) admitted

following facts, which are against the case of the prosecution:-

</p><p id="p_15">(i)     On Rochnamacha sana Ex.P.-13-C number is not mentioned.

</p><p id="p_16">(ii)    This fact is not mentioned in document Ex.P.-19-C that the seal

was deposited in police station.
</p>
<p id="p_17">(iii)   Only dak memo is attached with the challan papers, but copy of out

going register dated 30.09.2008 of police station Kuthala is not filed with

the challan papers.
</p><p id="p_18">                                      7                                Cr.A.670/2010
</p><p id="p_19">(iv)   As per document Ex.P.32 notice of <a href="/doc/669884/" id="a_19">Section 57</a> of NDPS Act was

received at S.P. Office Katni is not filed with the challan papers.

</p><p id="p_20">15.           Shri Patel (PW/10) during his evidence stated this new fact

that City Superintendent of Police was busy with the law and order duty for

Dussehra festival, therefore, he allowed him to conduct raid. This fact is

not mentioned in any document of the prosecution that C.S.P. was

engaged in such duty.
</p>
<p id="p_21">16.           Shri Patel (PW/10) also admitted this fact that to prove that

owner of the place of seizure was the appellant; he did not file any

document. Shri Patel (PW/10) admitted most important fact that he did not

collected any document which goes to show that Dhaba was of ownership

of the appellant and shifted this burden on Town Inspector. But, Shri B.S.

Rajput (PW/12) also accepted that he did not collect any document which

goes to show that on such and such land Dhaba and Betel Tapara were

situated. He also admitted that the require certificate of existence of

Dhaba and Betel Tapara were also not collected from the authority having

record under the shop establishment Act. Patwari Shri Chandra Shekhar

Kori (PW/13) firstly stated that the appellant was encroacher of

Government land bearing survey no.179 adjacent to by-pass road, but he

also accepted that he did not bring the relevant document with him to

show that the appellant has encroached the Government land by

constructing a Dhaba on it.
</p>
<p id="p_22">17.           The prosecution story were to be accepted, but in above

mentioned facts and circumstances, the liability in respect of the

contraband that was seized cannot be fastened on the appellant

because there is no evidence to establish any such nexus. There are

serious infirmities which would cast some degree of doubt on the
                                            8                           Cr.A.670/2010
      question whether the Ganja was recovered from the Betel Tapara was

      under exclusive possession of the appellant.

</p><p id="p_23">      18.            Even accepting the prosecution case at its best, the

      position that emerges is that no evidence was brought forward before

      the Court in order to indicate that the Betel Tapara, the premises from

      where the Ganja was allegedly recovered, belonged to the appellant

      only, that he was in exclusive possession of that premises, that the

      contraband had been brought there, that the appellant was dealing in it,

      or had handled it or that he was in any manner concerned with it

      positively.
</p>
<p id="p_24">      19.            It is essential to establish for the prosecution, particularly

      in the serious nature of case like present one that the appellant and he

      alone was the person from whose possession the contraband was

      recovered.     His mere presence on the Betel Tapara is not good

      enough.
</p>
<p id="p_25">      20.            Having regard to the state of the record, to my mind, the

      inferences drawn by the learned Trial Judge are wholly unsustainable.

      The appeal is liable to be allowed and accordingly succeeds. The

      conviction and sentence recorded against the appellant Radheshyam is

      set aside. It is directed that the appellant, who is in jail custody, be

      released forthwith, if not required in connection with any other offence.

      Fine, if paid, is directed to be refunded to him. The appeal is allowed

      accordingly.
