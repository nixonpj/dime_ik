<p id="p_1">      Petitioner is an Audio Visual Tehnician cum Roneo Operator

under the 3rd respondent. According to the petitioner, he was

getting pay in the scale of 4500-7000. It is stated that though he

is entitled the scale of pay of Rs.7480-11910, by Ext.P5 he was

extended revision only in the scale of 4510-7480. According to

the petitioner, he represented for fixation in the scale of 7480-

11910. That claim was considered and rejected by Ext.P11. It is

thereupon that the writ petition is filed.

</p><p id="p_2">      2. Counter affidavit has been filed by the first respondent.

It is stated that, the petitioner was appointed initially on daily

waged basis as Roneo Operator in 1987. He was regularized with

effect from 10.4.1990 in the scale of 675-1125. On the

implementation of the 1993 pay revision his pay was fixed in the

scale of 865-1450 and then in the scale of 1050-1600 with effect

from 1.3.1992. Again his pay was fixed at Rs.3350-5275. First

time bound higher grade on completion of 10 years                 was

extended to the petitioner as on 10.4.2000 and his pay was fixed

in the scale of 4000-6090. His pay was again refixed with effect

from 11.4.2000 and fixed in the scale of 4500-7000. It is also

stated that second time bound higher grade was given to the

petitioner in the scale of 4600-8000 and that his pay was fixed at

Rs.5625 on 11.4.2000.
</p>
<p id="p_3">      3. It is stated that his pay was fixed in the scale of 4500-

7000 with effect from 11.4.2000 on the basis that the post of Adio

Visual Technicial cum Roneo Operator is identical to the post of

Artist/Photographer Grd.I in the Rural Development Board. It is

also stated that the benefit of pay revision order dated 25.3.2006

was extended to the staff of the 3rd respondent vide order dated

29.6.2007 with effect from 1.7.2004.            According to the

respondents, in the Government order the entry scale of Audio

Visual Technician cum Roneo Operator is Rs.2750-4625 and that

at that time petitioner was erroneously enjoying the entry scale

of 3350-5275. It is also stated that in Ext.P8 Government Order,

the revised scale of pay of Visual Technician cum Roneo Operator

is 4510-7480, which was later modified as 4750-7820. It is stated

that therefore the pay of the petitioner fixed in Ext.P8 in the scale

of 4510-7480 is strictly in terms of the pay revision order dated

WPC.No. 3377/08
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                   :3 :</span>



25.3.2006. It is stated that the petitioner erroneously got the

higher initial scale only for the reason that he was given the

benefit of GO(MS).No.13/1991/LSG(RD) dated 28.8.1991, which

was not applicable to him.
</p>
<p id="p_4">      4. If the higher scale initially enjoyed by the petitioner was

erroneously given to him, it was always open to the respondent to

correct that error. Petitioner has no case that he was entitled to

the benefit of GO(MS)No.13/1991/LSG(RD) dated 28.8.1991, the

benefit of which was extended to him. If that be so, his pay in

revised scale could only have been in the scale of 2750-4625. If

that be so, the scale as revised by Ext.P8 is 4510-7480, which was

later modified as 4750-7820. Therefore, this is a case where an

error   initially committed      by    respondents  was     rectified.

Consequently therefore there is no substance in the claim of the

petitioner that he should have been given fixation in the scale

7480-11910.
