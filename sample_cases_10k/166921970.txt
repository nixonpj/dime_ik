<p id="p_4">2.      At the outset, the respondents have taken a preliminary objection as

to the maintainability of the present petition. The respondents contend that

the present petition under <a href="/doc/1980619/" id="a_3">Section 9</a> of the Act is not maintainable

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">O.M.P.(I) (COMM.) 23/2015                                             Page 2 of 65</span>
 principally on the ground that Part-I of the Act is inapplicable to arbitral

proceedings held outside India - in this case Singapore - and the parties

have impliedly agreed to exclude the applicability of <a href="/doc/1980619/" id="a_4">Section 9</a> of the Act.

The respondents also contend that the Arbitration and Conciliation

(Amendment) Act, 2015 (hereafter ‗the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_5">Amendment Act</a>') is inapplicable

to the present proceedings as the arbitral proceedings had commenced prior

to 23.10.2015. The petitioners contend otherwise.


</p><p id="p_5">3.      At this stage, the limited controversy that arises for consideration is

whether the petition filed by the petitioners is maintainable.


</p><p id="p_6">4.      Briefly stated,     the facts necessary to address the aforesaid

controversy are as under:-
</p>
<p id="p_7">
4.1     Raffles Education Corporation Limited (hereafter 'Raffles'), being

parent company of the petitioners' and Educomp Solutions Limited

(hereafter 'Educomp'), being parent company of the respondents' entered

into a Master Joint Venture Agreement(Master JVA) dated 16.05.2008.


Pursuant to the Master JVA, Educomp Raffles Higher Education

Limited(hereafter 'ERHEL') was incorporated as a joint venture company

for providing educational courses in management and designing at various

 locations in India. Shares of ERHEL were held by Raffles and Educomp in

equal proportion.
</p>
<p id="p_8">
4.2     ERHEL took control over the management of a Society namely, Jai

Radha Raman Education Society (hereafter 'the Society') to establish a

college in NOIDA (hereafter the 'Noida College'). Subsequently, Raffles

increased its stake in ERHEL to 58.18%.
</p>
<p id="p_9">
4.3     On 12.03.2015, the petitioners and the respondents entered into a

Share Purchase Agreement (hereafter 'the Agreement') whereby, on

fulfilling the conditions set out in the Agreement, shares of respondents in

ERHEL were to be acquired by the Petitioners. The relevant clause of the

Agreement reads as under:
</p>
<p id="p_10">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_5">                 "3.1.2. On deposit of the 10% of the Purchase Price by
               the Purchasers to the Escrow Agent referred to in clause
               3.1.1, the Sellers shall allow the Purchasers (i) to take
               control of the Company and JRRES, limited to the
               extent that the Purchasers shall have absolute say on the
               hiring and dismissal of employees (including existing
               employees); and (ii) to take charge of JRRES'
               application to the Government of Uttar Pradesh, India
               for becoming a deemed university. For clarification,
               upon the Execution Date, funding of the operations of

               which shall be shared with the Sellers from time to time
               till closing. In the event the Closing does not take place
               as envisaged in this Agreement and this Agreement is
               terminated, the Sellers shall within 30 (Thirty) days,

                introduce an amount equivalent to the total funding
               contributed by the Purchasers in JRRES for the
               operations of JRRES in this period as working capital."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_11">4.4     Certain disputes arose between the parties in relation to the

Agreement. Clause 15 of the Agreement provides that the Agreement

would be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of

Singapore. Further the Arbitration would be held in Singapore under the

Arbitration Rules of the Singapore International Arbitration Centre

(hereafter 'SIAC Rules').
</p>
<p id="p_12">
4.5     On 15.09.2015, the petitioners invoked the arbitration clause by

filing a Notice of Arbitration with the Singapore International Arbitration

Centre (hereafter 'SIAC') with a copy thereof to the respondents. Pursuant

to Rule 26.2 of the SIAC Rules, a request for appointment of an

Emergency Arbitrator was made by the petitioners to SIAC on 25.09.2015,

which was opposed by the respondents. The respondents by a notice dated

25.09.2015, terminated the Agreement alleging that Petitioners were in

repudiatory breach of the Agreement. Thereafter, on 28.09.2015, the Vice

President of the Court of Arbitration, SIAC appointed Mr Michael Lee as

the Emergency Arbitrator to consider the Emergency Application filed by

the claimants (petitioners herein).
</p>
<p id="p_13">


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">O.M.P.(I) (COMM.) 23/2015                                           Page 5 of 65</span>
 4.6     The Emergency Arbitrator passed an Interim Emergency Award

dated 06.10.2015 (hereafter ' the Emergency Award') wherein the Interim

relief sought by the claimants was granted and respondents were restrained

from taking any action that deprived the rights of the claimants in the

Agreement in respect of (a) hiring and dismissal of employees of the

Society; (b) functioning and management of the society. The respondents

were also restrained from instigating the terminated employees of the

Society, including Professor Mahesh Gandhi, to act contrary to their

respective termination letters and/or to indulge in any forcible entry into

the premises of the Society or the Noida College.
</p>
<p id="p_14">
4.7     Thereafter, the petitioners filed an application being Case No

929/2015 before the High Court of the Republic of Singapore (hereafter

'Singapore High Court') under Section 12 of the International Arbitration

Act (hereafter 'IAA') seeking enforcement of the Emergency Award

against respondent no 2. It is stated by the respondents that petitioners have

secured an enforcement order dated 04.02.2016 against respondent no 2.


4.8     The respondents filed an application under paragraph 7 of schedule 1

of SIAC Rules praying for setting aside of the Emergency Award.

However, on 14.01.2016, a consent order was passed by the sole arbitrator,

Mr Andrew Jeffries, wherein the operative first two paragraphs of the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">O.M.P.(I) (COMM.) 23/2015                                           Page 6 of 65</span>
 Emergency Award were reiterated but the parties also agreed that the said

paragraphs of the Emergency award: (1) are negative or prohibitory in

nature and not positive or mandatory in nature; and (2) do not require any

member of the Society to act in breach of their fiduciary duty to the

Society.
</p>
<p id="p_15">
</p><p id="p_16">5.      It is stated by the petitioners that despite passing of the Emergency

Award, the respondents are acting in contravention of the rights of the

petitioners under the Agreement inasmuch as respondents have refused to

accept the appointment of Dr C.S Sharma, who was appointed by the

petitioners to replace Professor Gandhi and further, respondent no 3 has

also refused to sign the cheques for payment of salary to Dr Sharma. It is

further stated the respondents are illegally and malafidely disrupting the

functioning of the Society and the Noida College. It is under these

circumstances, the petitioners have filed the present petition under <a href="/doc/1980619/" id="a_6">Section

9</a> of the Act.

Submissions


</p><p id="p_18">6.      At the outset, Mr Suhail Dutt, learned Senior Advocate appearing for

the respondents submitted that present petition is not maintainable and is

liable to be dismissed. He contended that since the seat of arbitration was



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">O.M.P.(I) (COMM.) 23/2015                                          Page 7 of 65</span>
 Singapore and the Agreement was entered into after the Supreme Court

had delivered the judgement in <a href="/doc/173015163/" id="a_7">Bharat Aluminium Company v. Kaiser

Aluminium Technical Services Inc</a>.: (2012) 9 SCC 552, Part I of the Act

would not apply and therefore, the present petition is not maintainable. Mr

Dutt drew the attention of this Court to <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_8">Section 26</a> of the Amendment Act

and contented that by virtue of <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_9">Section 26</a> of the Amendment Act, it was

not applicable in respect of arbitral proceedings that had commenced

before the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_10">Amendment Act</a> came into force, that is, 23.10.2015.


</p><p id="p_19">7.      Next, he referred to Clause 15 of the Agreement and without

prejudice to the contention that the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_11">Amendment Act</a> did not apply,

contended that since it was expressly agreed between the parties that the

arbitration would be governed by the laws of Singapore and the arbitral

proceedings would be conducted in accordance with the Rules of SIAC,

the parties had impliedly excluded the applicability of Part I of the Act to

the arbitral proceedings. He further submitted that proviso to <a href="/doc/1360825/" id="a_12">Section 2(2)</a>

as amended by the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_13">Amendment Act</a> provided that <a href="/doc/1980619/" id="a_14">sections 9</a>, <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_15">27</a>, <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_16">37(1)(a)</a>

and <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_17">37(3)</a> were applicable "subject to an agreement to the contrary". Mr

Dutt earnestly contended that the seat of the arbitration was Singapore and

the arbitration agreement was governed by the laws of Singapore and

therefore, applicability of Part-I was excluded by the parties by



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">O.M.P.(I) (COMM.) 23/2015                                         Page 8 of 65</span>
 implication. He submitted that in <a href="/doc/110552/" id="a_18">Bhatia International v. Bulk Trading

S.A and Anr</a>: (2002) 4 SCC 105, the Supreme Court held that Part I of the

Act shall apply to the international commercial arbitrations which take

place outside India, unless parties had expressly or impliedly excluded the

applicability of the Act. He submitted that even if it is accepted that the

<a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_19">Amendment Act</a> applies, the position of law would revert to what had been

held in Bhatia International (supra).
</p>
<p id="p_20">
</p><p id="p_21">8.      He further referred to the decisions of the Supreme Court in

<a href="/doc/1045460/" id="a_20">Videocon Industries Ltd. v. Union of India and Anr</a>: (2011) 6 SCC 161;

<a href="/doc/52496610/" id="a_21">Reliance Industries Limited and Anr. v. Union of India</a>: (2014) 7 SCC

603; and <a href="/doc/169405928/" id="a_22">Harmony Innovation Shipping Ltd. v. Gupta Coal India Ltd.

and Anr</a>.: (2015) 9 SCC 172 and contended that once the parties had

consciously agreed that the seat of arbitration would be outside India and

the arbitration agreement would be governed by a foreign law, it would not

be open for the parties to contend that Part I would also be applicable to the

arbitration agreement.
</p>
<p id="p_22">
</p><p id="p_23">9.      Next, Mr Dutt submitted that the reliefs as prayed for in the present

petition have already been granted by virtue of the Emergency Award and

recourse to <a href="/doc/1980619/" id="a_23">Section 9</a> for enforcement of Emergency Award (which is an

interim order) was not available.

the contentions advanced by Mr Dutt. He submitted that reading the

proviso to <a href="/doc/1360825/" id="a_24">Section 2(2)</a> of the Amendment Act in the manner as suggested

by Mr Dutt would render the said proviso absolutely redundant. He

contended that the very purpose for which <a href="/doc/1360825/" id="a_25">Section 2(2)</a> was amended was

to confer the jurisdiction on Indian courts in respect of <a href="/doc/1980619/" id="a_26">Sections 9</a> and <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_27">27</a> of

the Act, even if the seat of arbitration is outside India. He earnestly

contended that in the expression "subject to an agreement to the contrary",

the word "agreement" would mean something more than the choice of law

and seat of arbitration. He further submitted that the decision in Bhatia

International (supra) was no longer good law for agreements entered into

after 06.09.2012 as it was over-ruled prospectively by the constitution

bench of the Supreme Court in Bharat Aluminium (supra). He also

submitted that mere choosing SIAC Rules for arbitration does not in any

way indicate that Part I has been impliedly excluded by the parties.

proceeding per se and has been filed to prevent the respondents from

 proceedings commenced before commencement of the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_29">Amendment Act</a> on

the following grounds : (i) the expression " to arbitral proceedings " as

used in <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_30">Section 26</a> of the Amendment Act would not apply to proceedings

before a court; and (ii) Petition was filed under the Ordinance and on the

day it was filed, there was no provision in the ordinance excluding the

applicability of the amendments to arbitral proceedings commenced prior

to 23.10.2015 and by virtue of <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_31">Section 27(2)</a> of the Act, all acts done under

Reasoning and Conclusion


</p><p id="p_30">13.     In the aforesaid context as to the maintainability of the present

petition, the following questions arise for consideration:-


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_6">        (i)Whether the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_32">Amendment Act</a> are
        applicable to the present proceedings? and

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_7">        (ii) If the answer to the aforesaid question is in the affirmative
        whether <a href="/doc/1980619/" id="a_33">Section 9</a> of the Act is applicable by virtue of the
        proviso introduced in <a href="/doc/1360825/" id="a_34">Section 2(2)</a> of the Act by Section 2 (II)
        of the Amendment Act?
</blockquote>
<p id="p_31">14.     The controversy involved in the first question centres around the

interpretation of <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_35">Section 26</a> of the Amendment Act, which is set out

below:-
</p>
<p id="p_32">


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">O.M.P.(I) (COMM.) 23/2015                                              Page 11 of 65</span>
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_8">           ―26. Act not to apply to pending arbitral proceedings. -
          Nothing contained in this Act shall apply to the arbitral

          of <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_36">section 21</a> of the principal Act, before the commencement
          of this Act unless the parties otherwise agree but this Act
          shall apply in relation to arbitral proceedings commenced on
          or after the date of commencement of this Act.‖

</blockquote><p id="p_33">15.     As is plainly evident from the language of the aforesaid section, it is

in two parts. The first is couched in negative form; the opening words

expressly provide that the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_37">Amendment Act</a> shall not apply to arbitral

proceedings commenced in accordance with <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_38">section 21</a> of the Act, before

the commencement of the Act unless the parties agree otherwise. The

second limb is in the affirmative; that is, the Act would apply in relation to

arbitral proceedings commenced on or after the date of commencement of

the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_39">Amendment Act</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_34">
</p><p id="p_35">16.     In my view the aforesaid two limbs are not exhaustive. This is so

because the first limb - which is in the negative form - only refers to

proceedings commenced in accordance with <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_40">Section 21</a> of the Act prior to

the commencement of the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_41">Amendment Act</a> (23.10.2015). <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_42">Section 21</a> is in

Part I of the Act and, indisputably, applies only to arbitral proceedings in

India. There is no reference to arbitral proceedings that have commenced

other than under Part-I of the Act. Thus, clearly, the first limb of <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_43">Section

26</a> of the Amendment Act would not cover arbitral proceedings



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">O.M.P.(I) (COMM.) 23/2015                                            Page 12 of 65</span>
 commenced outside India - arbitral proceedings to which Part I of the Act

does not apply. In the context of those arbitral proceedings clearly the

provisions of Part II of the Act as amended by the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_44">Amendment Act</a> would

be applicable and nothing in <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_45">Section 26</a> of the Amendment Act bars the

applicability of the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_46">Amendment Act</a> to those proceedings.


</p><p id="p_36">17.     If the arbitral proceedings that have commenced under <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_47">Section 21</a> of

the Act prior to 23.10.2015 and those that are commenced after 23.10.2015

do not exhaust the entire statutory space to which the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_48">Amendment Act</a> is

applicable, then plainly the provisions of <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_49">Section 26</a> as to the applicability

of the Act are not exhaustive. In other words, <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_50">Section 26</a> is silent as to the

applicability of the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_51">Amendment Act</a> to proceedings which are not

expressly indicated under <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_52">Section 26</a> of the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_37">
</p><p id="p_38">18.     The second aspect to be kept in mind is the meaning of the

expression "arbitral proceedings". <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_53">Section 21</a> of the Act provides for

commencement of arbitral proceedings and reads as under:


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_9">           ―21.Commencement of arbitral proceedings.--Unless
           otherwise agreed by the parties, the arbitral proceedings

           arbitration is received by the respondent.‖

</blockquote><p id="p_39"> 19.     <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_54">Section 32</a> of the Act contains provisions regarding termination of

proceedings. The said section is set out below:-

                with the termination of the arbitral proceedings.‖

</blockquote><p id="p_41">20.     A conjoint reading of <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_57">Section 21</a> and <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_58">32</a> of the Act also indicates the

scope of the expression "arbitral proceedings". Any proceedings initiated in

the Court outside the course of the arbitral proceedings can by no stretch

be considered to fall within the scope of arbitral proceedings. Thus, a

petition to set aside the arbitral award under <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_59">Section 34</a> or for that matter a

petition under <a href="/doc/1980619/" id="a_60">Section 9</a> to seek interim measures of protection after the

 arbitral award has been passed would clearly be proceedings, which by no

stretch can be considered as arbitral proceedings.


</p><p id="p_42">21.     Bearing the aforesaid in mind, it would be noticed that the first limb

of <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_61">Section 26</a> of the Act only bars its applicability to arbitral proceedings.

The use of the word ‗to' instead ‗in relation to', as is used for the second

limb of <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_62">Section 26</a>, is material. The use of the word ‗to' clearly restricts the

import of the first limb of <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_63">Section 26</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_43">
</p><p id="p_44">22.     The distinction between the expression ‗to' and ‗in relation to' was

highlighted by the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/1983009/" id="a_64">Thyssen Stahlunion Gmbh v. Steel

of the Act. <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_66">Section 85</a> of the Act is the repeal and savings clause. By virtue

          Arbitration and <a href="/doc/1306164/" id="a_72">Conciliation Act</a>, 1996).
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_18">          The phrase ―in relation to arbitral proceedings‖ cannot be
          given a narrow meaning to mean only pendency of the
          arbitration proceedings before the arbitrator. It would cover
          not only proceedings pending before the arbitrator but would
          also cover the proceedings before the court and any
          proceedings which are required to be taken under the old Act
          for the award becoming a decree under <a href="/doc/1171700/" id="a_73">Section 17</a> thereof

                                  ***

        The expression ―in relation to‖ is of the widest import as
        held by various decisions of this Court in Doypack Systems
        (P) Ltd., Mansukhlal Dhanraj Jain, Dhanrajamal Gobindram
        and Navin Chemicals Mfg. This expression ―in relation to‖
        has to be given full effect to, particularly when read in
        conjunction with the words ―the provisions‖ of the old Act.
        That would mean that the old Act will apply to the whole
        gambit of arbitration culminating in the enforcement of the
        award. If it was not so, only the word "to" could have
        sufficed and when the legislature has used the expression
        "in relation to", a proper meaning has to be given. This
        expression does not admit of restrictive meaning. The first
        limb of <a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_74">Section 85</a> (2)(a) is not a limited saving clause. It
        saves not only the proceedings pending at the time of
        commencement of the new Act but also the provisions of the
        old Act for enforcement of the award under that Act.‖

</blockquote><p id="p_46">23.     As noticed above, while in the first limb, the word used is ―to‖

arbitral proceedings and in the second limb, the expression used is ―in

relation to‖ arbitral proceedings. Thus, if the aforesaid expressions are

interpreted in the manner as indicated by the Supreme Court in Thyssen

Stahlunion Gmbh (supra), the first limb of Section 26 of the Amendment

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">O.M.P.(I) (COMM.) 23/2015                                            Page 16 of 65</span>
 Act would have to be read in a restrictive manner. In other words, the

<a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_75">Amendment Act</a> would not apply to arbitral proceedings commenced under

Part-I of the Act before 23.10.2015. There is no controversy regarding the

second limb of <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_76">Section 26</a>; undisputedly, it has a much wider sweep and

covers all proceedings, which are connected with the arbitral proceedings -

whether commenced under Part-I or otherwise - including proceedings

under <a href="/doc/737017/" id="a_77">Sections 8</a>, <a href="/doc/1980619/" id="a_78">9</a>, <a href="/doc/187697/" id="a_79">14</a>, <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_80">34</a> and <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_81">37</a> of the Act.

<p id="p_47">
</p><p id="p_48">24.     Mr Dutt's contention that the use of the word "to" and the expression

"in relation to" is not of much significance and the intention of the

legislature was clear that the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_82">Amendment Act</a> should not

be applied to any proceedings in relation to arbitral proceedings

commenced before 23.10.2015, is unpersuasive. It is well settled that if the

legislature uses different words in respect of the same subject matter, it

must be understood that they were not used to convey the same meaning.

<a href="/doc/1553487/" id="a_83">In The Member, Board of Revenue v. Arthur Paul Benthall</a>: AIR 1956

SC 35 a Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court observed that "When

two words of different import are used in a statute in two consecutive

provisions, it would be difficult to maintain that they are used in the same

sense". <a href="/doc/1119469/" id="a_84">In D.L.F. Qutab Enclave Complex Educational Charitable Trust

 that "When different terminologies are used by the legislature it must be

presumed that the same had been done consciously with a view to convey

different meanings."

<p id="p_49">
</p><p id="p_50">25.     To summarise, <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_85">Section 26</a> of the Amendment Act is silent as to, (i)

arbitral proceedings commenced before 23.10.2015 to which Part-I of the

Act does not apply; (ii) proceedings in courts in relation to arbitral

proceedings commenced before 23.10.2015 to which part-I of the Act

applies; and (iii) proceedings in courts in relation to arbitral proceedings

commenced before 23.10.2015 to which Part-I does not apply.


</p><p id="p_51">26.     The next aspect to be examined is whether the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_86">Amendment Act</a>

would apply to proceedings before the court. As discussed earlier, <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_87">Section

 proceedings that have commenced prior to that date has expressly been

excluded and, therefore, to that extent the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_92">Amendment Act</a> would not be

applicable. However for proceedings other than those expressly excluded,

the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_93">Amendment Act</a> would be applicable from the date it came into force.


</p><p id="p_54">28.     Mr Dutt had, during the course of his arguments, also mentioned that

applying the amended provisions of the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_94">Amendment Act</a> in relation to

pending proceedings would imply that the provisions were being applied

retrospectively. He did not pursue this line of argument, but in my view, it

must be addressed for the sake of completeness.
</p>
<p id="p_55">
</p><p id="p_56">29.     It is important to clarify that applying the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_95">Amendment Act</a> from

23.10.2015 does not indicate that the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_96">Amendment Act</a> is being applied

retrospectively in the true sense because the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_97">Amendment Act</a> replaced the

Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Ordinance, 2015; by virtue of

<a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_98">Section 27(1)</a> of the Amendment Act, the said ordinance was repealed and

by virtue of <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_99">Section 27(2)</a>, all acts done under the Act as amended by the

Ordinance were deemed to be done under the Act as amended by the

</p>
<p id="p_57">
</p><p id="p_58">30.     The issue to be considered is whether the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_101">Amendment Act</a> should be

interpreted as not applicable to court proceedings for the reason that the



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">O.M.P.(I) (COMM.) 23/2015                                         Page 19 of 65</span>
 same would make the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_102">Amendment Act</a> a retrospective legislation? The

well accepted principle of interpretation is that all statutes affecting

substantive rights should be interpreted as being applicably prospectively

unless indicated otherwise either expressly or by necessary implication.

There is a general presumption that unless the statute expressly indicates, it

would not be applied retrospectively to impair a vested right or impose a

fresh burden based on past transaction/events. However, procedural laws

are presumed to apply retrospectively; this is so because as explained by

the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/1597336/" id="a_103">Anant Gopal Sheorey v. State of Bombay</a>: AIR

1958 SC 915, "no person has any right in any course of procedure". <a href="/doc/1951865/" id="a_104">In

Amireddi Raja Gopala Rao v. Amireddi Sitharamamma and Ors</a>: (1965)

3 SCR 122, the Supreme Court had observed that "It is a well-recognised

rule that a statute should be interpreted, if possible, so as to respect vested

rights." These principles have to be kept in mind while addressing the

above issue.
</p>
<p id="p_59">
</p><p id="p_60">31.     <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_105">The Act</a> embodies the Indian Law as applicable to arbitrations. The

nature of arbitration law is essentially procedural but it also includes

provisions with regard to matters that cannot be classified as mere

procedural matters. This would include the question as to whether the

disputes are arbitrable; the question as to jurisdiction; the scope of

 challenge to the awards; and, to some extent even the supportive and

supervisory roles of Courts in relation to arbitrations. Thus, the <a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_106">Amending

Act</a> does to certain extent affect the substantive rights of parties. The

question thus arises is: whether in view of the such effect, the applicability

of the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_107">Amendment Act</a> to proceedings instituted in courts in relation to

arbitral proceedings instituted prior to 23.10.2015, should be interpreted to

be excluded?
</p>
<p id="p_61">
</p><p id="p_62">32.     It is also well settled that an amending enactment is not retrospective

merely because it also applies to persons to whom the pre-amended Act

applies. <a href="/doc/778813/" id="a_108">In Punjab University v. Subhash Chander and Anr</a>.: 1984 (3)

SCC 603, the Supreme Court set aside the decision of the Full Bench of

the Punjab and Haryana High Court, whereby it was held that the

amendment to the rules to award lower grace marks would not be

applicable to students who had been admitted to the course prior to the

amendment. <a href="/doc/867790/" id="a_109">In Bishan Naraian Mishra vs State of U.P</a>: 1965 (1) SCR the

Supreme Court held that the amendment in the rules reducing the age of

superannuation from 58 years to 55 years could not be considered as

retrospective and would apply to all employees altering the age of

superannuation after the amendment notwithstanding that the age of

superannuation was higher when they had joined the employment. The

 Court held that merely because a legislation applies to past acts does not

make the law retrospective. In The Queen v. The Inhabitants of St. Mary,

Whitechapel: (1848) 12 QBD 120 the court observed that a statute "is not

properly called a retrospective statute because a part of the requisites for

its action is drawn from a time antecedent to its passing". This principle

was cited with approval by the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/1786180/" id="a_110">Rao Shiv Bahadur Singh

and Anr. v. State of Vindhya Pradesh</a>: AIR 1953 SC 394.


</p><p id="p_63">33.     Most enactments would invariably affect some existing rights

however they cannot be considered as a retrospective legislation only for

that reason.
</p>
<p id="p_64">
</p><p id="p_65">34.     It is also necessary to bear in mind that the rights of the parties for

resolution of disputes were crystallised when they agreed for resolution of

the disputes by arbitration and not when the arbitration agreement was

invoked. Thus, in any view, even if it is assumed that the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_111">Amendment Act</a>

has a retroactive effect, simply interpreting <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_112">Section 26</a> of the Amendment

Act to exclude its applicability to proceedings in relation to arbitral

proceedings would not address the issue of interpreting the enactment in a

manner so as to avoid its retroactive effect, if any.




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">O.M.P.(I) (COMM.) 23/2015                                            Page 22 of 65</span>
</p><p id="p_66"> 35.     Thus, in my view, a more appropriate approach would be to consider

the nature of arbitration law and effect of the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_113">Amendment Act</a> as a whole.

Essentially, the provisions of an arbitration law can be classified into four

broad categories. The first being the provisions which relate to matters

which define the scope of arbitrations; this includes provisions defining the

matters that are arbitrable; the scope of arbitration agreements, etc. Such

provisions define the entire scope of arbitration and the legal policy of the

Alternate Dispute Resolution Mechanism. The second category of

provisions relate to the conduct of arbitrations. These provisions essentially

provide for the manner in which arbitration shall be conducted. The

provisions under chapter V of the Act clearly fall within this category. The

parties are free to derogate from most of such provisions and agree to a

separate set of rules for conduct of arbitrations. The parties are also free to

adopt the rules of any institutional arbitration such as International

Chambers of Commerce (ICC), London Court of International Arbitration

(LCIA), Delhi International Arbitration Centre (DIAC) etc. The third

category of provisions relate to the interface between the courts and the

arbitration process. <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_114">The Act</a> contains provisions in aid of arbitral

proceedings such as role of courts in appointment of arbitrators, assistance

in taking evidence, etc. This category would also include provisions

relating to exercise of supervisory role by courts including setting aside of

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">O.M.P.(I) (COMM.) 23/2015                                           Page 23 of 65</span>
 awards. One facet of this category would also be enforcement of awards by

courts.
</p>
<p id="p_67">
</p><p id="p_68">36.      As discussed earlier, insofar as the rules pertaining to conduct of

arbitral proceedings are concerned, the legislature in its wisdom has

specifically provided that the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_115">Amendment Act</a> would not apply to arbitral

proceedings that were commenced prior to 23.10.2015. The applicability of

the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_116">Amendment Act</a> that relate to the supportive and

supervisory role of courts, may be considered in the context of the reasons

that led to enactment of such provisions.
</p>
<p id="p_69">
</p><p id="p_70">37.      The Consultation Paper (hereafter 'the consultation paper') on the

proposed amendments to the Act placed in public domain in April, 2010 by

the Government of India, indicated the reasons for amending the Act as

under:
</p>
<p id="p_71">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_19">          ―As we know that main purpose of the 1996 Act is to
          encourage an ADR method for resolving disputes speedy
          and without much interference of the Courts. In fact <a href="/doc/1091250/" id="a_117">Section
          5</a> of the Act provides, ―Notwithstanding anything contained
          in any other law for the time being in force, in matters
          covered by this Part (i.e. Part I), no judicial authority shall
          intervene except where so provided in this Part.‖ However,
          with the passage of time, some difficulties in its
          applicability of the Act have been noticed. The Supreme
          Court and High Courts have interpreted many provisions of
          the Act and while doing so they have also realized some
          lacunas in the Act which leads to conflicting views. Further,


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">O.M.P.(I) (COMM.) 23/2015                                             Page 24 of 65</span>
           in some cases, courts have interpreted the provisions of the
          Act in such a way which defeats the main object of such a
          legislation. Therefore, it becomes necessary to remove the
          difficulties and lacunas in the Act so that ADR method may
          become more popular and object of enacting Arbitration
          law may be achieved.‖


</blockquote><p id="p_72">38.     The amendments introduced by the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_118">Amendment Act</a> are based on

246th Report of the Law Commission of India. A plain reading of the said

report clearly indicates that most of the amendments are occasioned by the

decisions rendered by the courts (mainly the Supreme Court of India). In

some cases, the courts had pointed out certain anomalies while in the other

cases, the courts had interpreted the law, which the Government felt was

different from India's legal policy relating to arbitration. Thus, several

amendments have also been introduced to overcome the decisions rendered

by the courts.

</p><p id="p_74">39.     The amendment to <a href="/doc/1360825/" id="a_119">Section 2(2)</a> of the Act has been introduced

principally to strengthen the view of the Supreme Court in Bharat

Aluminium (supra) in respect of lex arbitri being the law that is applicable

at the seat of arbitration; at the same time also enable courts to pass interim

orders. The amendment is also to overcome the view in Bhatia

being conducted overseas.

<p id="p_75">
</p><p id="p_76">40.     Significant amendments have been introduced to <a href="/doc/1519126/" id="a_120">Section 11</a> of the

Act principally to restrict the judicial intervention at pre-arbitral stage in

conformity with <a href="/doc/737017/" id="a_121">Section 8</a> and <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_122">45</a> of the Act and further to promote

institutional arbitrations. <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_123">Section 11A</a> and IVth Schedule to the Act have

been introduced in respect of the arbitral fees. The issue as to excessive

arbitral fees had been flagged by the Supreme Court in Union of India v

Singh Builders Syndicate: (2009) 4 SCC 523; and notice of this was taken

by the Law Commission. The amendments to <a href="/doc/643968/" id="a_124">Section 12</a> have been made

and Vth Schedule has been introduced to ensure the neutrality of the

arbitrators as this issue had been highlighted in several decisions rendered

by the Supreme Court. Substantial amendments have been brought in

<a href="/doc/1908442/" id="a_125">Section 17</a> of the Act to enable arbitral tribunals to pass orders which can

be effectively enforced. The Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/507484/" id="a_126">Sundaram Finance Ltd v.

NEPC India Ltd</a>: (1999) 2 SCC 479 had pointed out that the orders passed

by the arbitral tribunal cannot be enforced as orders of the Court and,

therefore, the parties have to resort to <a href="/doc/1980619/" id="a_127">Section 9</a> of the Act.             The

Commission also noted that in <a href="/doc/155719426/" id="a_128">Sri Krishan v. Anand</a>: 2009 3 Arb LR 447

 enforcing the orders by reading <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_129">Section 27(5)</a> of the Act in a manner so as

to hold a person violating interim orders, guilty of contempt. The

a complete solution and, therefore, amendments were required to give teeth

to the orders of the arbitral tribunal.

<p id="p_77">
</p><p id="p_78">41.     <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_130">The Act</a> has also brought about significant changes in <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_131">Section 34</a> of

the ‗public policy' as explained by the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/1557021/" id="a_133">Renu Sagar

 Press Steel &amp; Fabrications Pvt Ltd and Anr: 2004 (1) SCC 540 wherein

the Supreme Court had criticized the provision of automatic suspension of

</p><p id="p_81">43.     It is thus, seen that most of the amendments introduced in the Act

were either clarificatory or to address certain anomalies in the Act or to

remove difficulties.
</p>
<p id="p_82">
</p><p id="p_83">44.     The essential purpose of the Act is to provide the legal framework

for an Alternate Dispute Resolution (ADR) mechanism. And, as stated

above, the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_138">Amendment Act</a> has been enacted for removing the difficulties

and the lacunae in the Act. The entire purpose of the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_139">Amendment Act</a> is to

improve the efficacy of the ADR. Whilst it is understandable that the

arbitral proceedings that have already commenced, should be continued in

accordance with the procedure as adopted; it is difficult to understand the

rationale as to why the supportive and supervisory role of Courts in regard

to those proceedings be not provided as per the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_140">Amendment Act</a>. If the

contention as advanced by the respondents is accepted, it would mean that

the courts would adopt different approach in lending their aid to

proceedings and enforcement of awards depending upon when the arbitral

proceedings commenced.
</p>
<p id="p_84">


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_28">O.M.P.(I) (COMM.) 23/2015                                          Page 28 of 65</span>
</p><p id="p_85"> 45.     As an illustration, let us consider a case where two sets of parties

enter into similar contracts prior to 23.10.2015. Disputes relating to one

agreement arises before 23.10.2015 and one of the parties invokes the

arbitration clause. In the other case, disputes arise after 23.10.2015 and the

arbitral proceedings commence thereafter. Arbitral awards in respect of

disputes between both the sets of parties are made on the same date - after

23.10.2015. By virtue of the amendment to <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_141">Section 36</a> of the Act, the stay

of an arbitral award is no longer automatic after the period for setting aside

the award under <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_142">Section 34</a> of the Act has expired and unless the Court

hearing an application under <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_143">Section 34</a> of the Act grants a stay, the

arbitral award is liable to be enforced. If the contention of the respondent is

accepted then the Court would have to view the awards rendered in the

light of when the arbitral proceedings were commenced. While in the case

of former, the arbitral award would be automatically stayed on any party

filing an application under <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_144">Section 34</a> of the Act but that would not be the

case in respect of the latter notwithstanding that the arbitral awards were

rendered on the same date. This, in my view, can clearly not be the

intention of the legislature.
</p>
<p id="p_86">

principally be a procedural matter. The Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/919955/" id="a_145">Narhari

 Shivram Shet Narvekar v. Pannalal Umediram</a>: (1976) 3 SCC 203, held

that a decree passed by an Indian Court against a foreigner which was non-

executable in Goa (which was not a part of India) at the time when it was

passed, became executable once Goa became a part of India and the Code

of Civil Procedure was extended to Goa. The Supreme Court further

observed:-
</p>
<p id="p_88">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_20">         ―It seems to us that the right of the judgment- debtor to pay up
         the decree passed against him cannot be said to be a vested
         right, nor can be question of executability of the decree be
         regarded as a substantive vested right of the judgment-debtor.
         A fortiorari the execution proceedings being purely a matter of
         procedure it is well settled that any change in law which is
         made during the pendency of the cause would be deemed to be
         retro-active in operation and the Appellate Court is bound to

</blockquote><p id="p_89">47.     In Kuwait Minister of Public v. Sir Frederick Snow &amp; Partners:

(1984) 1 All ER 733 (HL), the Court held that an arbitral award would be

executable in United Kingdom if the foreign State was a party to the New

York Convention, notwithstanding that such State was not a party to the

convention when the award was made. Therefore, lifting the stay of

enforcement on an award would essentially be an alteration in the

procedure.

interpreted as inapplicable for enforcement of awards rendered in relation

amendments introduced to <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_147">Section 34</a> of the Act are also substantive,

however, it is seen that the same have been introduced to bring the defence

of ―public policy‖ within the scope of that defence, as explained by the

Supreme Court in Renu Sagar (supra). The suggestion that changes

introduced in <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_148">Section 34</a> of the Act are substantial therefore affect the

vested rights of the parties, is also inconsiderable.         The extent of

vested right to any significant extent so as to read <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_149">Section 34</a> of the Act to

           unfair to those concerned in them, unless a contrary
           intention appears. It is not simply a question of
           classifying an enactment as retrospective or not
           retrospective. Rather it may well be a matter of degree--

concerned with the applicability of <a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_150">Section 13A</a> of the Arbitration Act of

1950. The said provision came into force on 01.01.1992 and enabled the

arbitrators to dismiss the claim if any of the following conditions were

satisfied: "(a) that there has been inordinate and inexcusable delay on the

part of the claimant in pursuing the claim; and (b) that the delay - (i) will

give rise to a substantial risk that it is not possible to have a fair resolution

of the issues in that claim; or (ii) has caused, or is likely to cause or to

have caused, serious prejudice to the respondent." In that case, the

disputes between the parties were referred to arbitration in 1985 and after

filing of the claims and statement of defence, the arbitration had not

 proceeded further. After the introduction of <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_151">Section 13A</a> in the <a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_152">Arbitration

Act</a> 1950, the respondents filed for dismissal of the case and the arbitrators

accepted the application and dismissed the case. In the aforesaid context,

the claimants argued that the arbitrator could not take into account the

delay that had occurred prior to insertion of <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_153">Section 13A</a> as the said

provision could not have any retrospective operation. The Court rejected

the aforesaid contention. The following passage from the concurring

opinion of Lord Mustill is instructive:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_22">            ―If there were any doubt about this the loud and prolonged
            chorus of complaints about the disconformity between
            practices in arbitration and in the High Court, and the
            increasing impatience for something to be done about it,
            show quite clearly that s 13A was intended to bite in full
            from the outset. If the position were otherwise it would
            follow that, although Parliament has accepted the advice
            of all those who had urged that this objectionable system
            should be brought to an end, and has grasped the nettle
            and provided a remedy, it has reconciled itself to the
            continuation of arbitral proceedings already irrevocably
            stamped with a risk of injustice. I find it impossible to
            accept that Parliament can have intended any such thing,
            and with due respect to those who have suggested
            otherwise I find the meaning of s 13A sufficiently clear to
            persuade me that in the interests of reform Parliament was
            willing to tolerate the very qualified kind of hardship
            implied in giving the legislation a partially retrospective
            effect.‖

be a member of Panchyat or continue as such. The Supreme Court rejected

the contention that the said provision would not be applicable to the

existing members. The relevant observations of the court are quoted

below:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_23">            "It is now well-settled that when a literal reading of the
            provision giving retrospective effect does not produce
            absurdity or anomaly, the same would not be construed
            to be only prospective. The negation is not a rigid rule
            and varies with the intention and purport of the
            legislature, but to apply it in such a case is a doctrine of
            fairness. When a law is enacted for the benefit of the
            community as a whole, even in the absence of a
            provision, the statute may be held to be retrospective in
            nature. The appellant does not and cannot question the
            competence of the legislature in this behalf."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_98">53.     Thus, even in cases where there is no provision that the new law is

to be applied retrospectively, the Courts would nonetheless apply the same

if it is fair to do so and if it furthers the intention of the legislature.


</p><p id="p_99">54.     The question whether <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_155">Section 26</a> of the Amendment Act should be

interpreted in a manner so as to exclude its applicability to Court

</p><p id="p_101">55.     The stated object of <a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_156">Arbitration Act</a> has always been to provide for a

speedy resolution of disputes and provide an efficacious ADR mechanism.

<a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_157">The Act</a> was enacted in 1996 to consolidate laws relating to Domestic

Arbitrations, International Commercial Arbitrations and enforcement of

Foreign Awards. After its enactment, it was felt that the Act had certain

lacunae which needed to be addressed. In the year 2001, the Law

Commission          of      India   undertook   a   comprehensive   review     and

recommended several Amendments in its 176th Report to the Government

of India. The Government of India decided to accept most of the

recommendations and accordingly, the Arbitration and Conciliation

(Amendment) Bill, 2003 was introduced in the Rajya Sabha on 22.12.2003.

Thereafter, in July, 2004, the Government constituted a Committee under

the Chairmanship of Justice Dr B.P. Saraf to undertake the study of

implications of the recommendations of the Law Commission relating to

Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Bill, 2003. The Bill was

thereafter referred to the Departmental Standing Committee on Personnel,

Public Grievances, Law and Justice. The said Committee after taking



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_35">O.M.P.(I) (COMM.) 23/2015                                              Page 35 of 65</span>
 evidence of eminent advocates, representatives of Trade and Industry and

other stake holders submitted a report on 04.08.2005. The Committee also

recommended that the Bill of 2003 may be withdrawn to bring a fresh

legislation. The said Bill of 2003 was thereafter withdrawn for further

examination. In 2010, the Government of India issued the Consultation

Paper inviting suggestions from public and other stakeholders.


</p><p id="p_102">56.     Thereafter, the Ministry of Law and Justice asked the Law

Commission of India to undertake a study of the proposed amendments.

The Law Commission of India submitted its report on 05.08.2014 and

proposed several amendments to the Act. The Amended Act is essentially

based on the said proposals. Most of the amendments also address the

issues that were sought to be addressed by the 2003 Bill. Thus, it is clear

that there has been a long standing demand for amending the Act to make

it more effective. The amendments for restricting Judicial Review and for

removing the provision for an automatic stay of execution of the awards

have been on the anvil since several years. The Government of India

caused the President to promulgate the Arbitration and Conciliation

(Amendment) Ordinance, 2015 [No.9 of 2015], which was published in the

Gazette of India on 23.10.2015 and it came into effect immediately. The

fact that Government caused the Ordinance to be issued under <a href="/doc/1218134/" id="a_158">Article 123



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_36">O.M.P.(I) (COMM.) 23/2015                                        Page 36 of 65</span>
 (1)</a> of the Constitution of India - which is issued where the President is

satisfied that circumstances exist which make it necessary for him to take

immediate action - without waiting for the Parliament Session to

commence clearly indicates that the Government was of the view that it

was necessary to immediately implement the proposed amendments. In the

circumstances, it is difficult to accept that the intention of the Legislature

was not to apply the said provisions in respect of proceedings instituted

before the courts after 23.10.2015 either under <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_159">Section 34</a> or under <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_160">Section

36</a> of the Act.

<p id="p_103">
</p><p id="p_104">57.     It is also relevant to note that it is not the respondents' contention

that the applicability of the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_161">Amendment Act</a> depends on the date when the

parties entered into the Arbitration Agreement; thus, no vested right can be

claimed by the parties in respect to the pre-amended Act.


</p><p id="p_105">58.     It is also relevant to mention that as far as enforceability of foreign

awards is concerned, any proceedings for enforcement of a foreign award

after 23.10.2015 would, undisputedly, be in terms of the Act as amended. It

is not disputed that in the facts of the present case, any award that is passed

by the Arbitral Tribunal in Singapore would be enforceable as a foreign

award in accordance with the provisions of Part-II of the Act as amended

by virtue of the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_162">Amendment Act</a>. In this view, it is also difficult to

provisions of the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_164">Amendment Act</a> be ignored but the arbitral award that

may follow would be enforced according to the Amended Act.

Act</a>, not only to all applications filed before a court/ arbitral tribunal after

the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_173">Amendment Act</a> came into force, but it was also proposed that certain

provisions be applied retrospectively to proceedings before the arbitral

tribunal. The proposal with regard to retrospective application to pending

proceedings was not accepted, therefore, <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_174">Section 26</a> expressly provides that

nothing in the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_175">Amendment Act</a> would apply to pending arbitral

proceedings. The proposal that the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_176">Amendment Act</a> shall apply only to

fresh arbitrations was accepted as is plainly evident from the language of

the latter part of <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_177">Section 26</a> of the Amendment Act. No specific provision

<p id="p_108">60.     The view that <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_182">Section 26</a> of the Amendment Act does not apply to

arbitration is also Singapore and therefore the law as applicable to the

arbitral proceedings, lex arbitri, is also the law as applicable in Singapore.

The legal principle that the law as applicable to arbitral proceedings would

Following its earlier decisions in Bhatia International (supra), the

Supreme Court had reiterated that provisions of Part I of the Act would be

applicable unless the same was expressly or impliedly excluded by the

the contract including clause (b) which deals with the settlement of

disputes by arbitration. The Court rejected the contention that the afore-

quoted clause (c) could not be construed to mean that Indian law was the

substantive law of contract or the Indian law would not govern the

Disputes Resolution clause - clause (b) quoted above.               The Court

          background, the context of the contract and the circumstances
          of the parties and in the background in which the contract was
          entered into, irresistibly lead in that direction. We are not
          impressed by the submission that by such interpretation it will
          put the Respondent in an advantageous position. Therefore,

          is a proper clause or substantial clause and not a curial or a
          procedural one by which the arbitration proceedings are to be
          conducted and hence, we are disposed to think that the seat of
          arbitration will be at London.‖

</blockquote><p id="p_150">81.      Mr Dutt, learned counsel had earnestly contended that in view of the

decisions of the Supreme Court in Videocon Industries (supra) Harmony

Innovation Shipping Ltd. (supra) and Reliance Industries (supra) it was

clear that the parties had implicitly agreed to exclude <a href="/doc/1980619/" id="a_266">Section 9</a> of the Act

to the arbitral proceedings , because they had agreed that the agreement

would be construed and considered in accordance with law in Singapore.


</p><p id="p_151">82.      I am unable to accept the aforesaid contention mainly for the reason

that the controversy considered by the Supreme Court in Dozco Industries

Pvt Ltd, Videocon Industries, Reliance Industries v. Union of India,

Union of India v. Reliance Industries and Harmony Innovation Shipping

Ltd. (supra) was materially different from the question involved in the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_53">O.M.P.(I) (COMM.) 23/2015                                              Page 53 of 65</span>
 present case. In those cases, the question before the Supreme Court was as

to which law was applicable to the arbitral proceedings - which was the

lex arbitri. An agreement that the proper law of arbitration (lex arbitri) of

a country other than India would govern the arbitration agreement would

necessarily exclude the Act as lex arbitri and consequently Part I of the

Act.

<p id="p_152">
</p><p id="p_153">83.     In Reliance Industries cases (supra), the parties had expressly

agreed that the arbitration agreement shall be governed by the laws of

England. So was the case in Videocon Industries (supra). Undisputedly, if

the parties had agreed that the proper law applicable to the arbitration

would be that of a foreign country it would necessarily mean that the Act

would not be the proper law governing the arbitration. The two are

mutually exclusive.

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_62">          ―41. It is undisputed that the IAA applies to SIAC 179 as
          Singapore is the seat of the arbitration (as confirmed by the
          Emergency Arbitrator in paragraph 10 of the Emergency
          Award [TAB 1]). The Plaintiffs understand that this
          Honourable Court has supervisory and/or curial jurisdiction
          over SIAC 179 and Section 12(6) of the IAA specifically
          provides that ―all orders or directions made or given by an
          arbitral tribunal in the course of an arbitration shall, by leave
          of the High Court or a Judge thereof, be enforceable in the

agreement between the parties that a foreign law would be applicable to the

arbitration, implicitly excludes the applicability of <a href="/doc/1980619/" id="a_268">Section 9</a> of the Act?

in respect of the arbitral proceedings held or to be held outside India. The

          arbitration between Indian nationals and also where one party

           UNCITRAL Model Law permits certain Articles like 8, 9, 35
          and 36 to apply to arbitrations outside the Country, there is an
          omission in this behalf in the 1996 Act. Consequently, for
          example in the absence of availability of <a href="/doc/1980619/" id="a_271">Section 9</a> in the case
          of an arbitration outside India, the Indian party is unable to
          obtain interim measures from Indian Courts, before arbitration
          starts outside India. The absence of an express provision as
          stated above has led to conflicting judgments in the Delhi and
          Calcutta High Courts. It is proposed to allow <a href="/doc/1980619/" id="a_272">Section 9</a> to the
          invoked whenever arbitration is outside India. Similarly, the
          provisions of <a href="/doc/737017/" id="a_273">Section 8</a>, <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_274">27</a>, <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_275">35</a> and <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_276">36</a> are proposed to be
          made available whenever arbitration is outside India. Almost
          all countries which have adopted the Model Law allow views
          of these provisions to arbitrations outside the country. The
          proposed clause (a) of <a href="/doc/1360825/" id="a_277">Section 2(2)</a> states that Part - I of the
          Act applies to domestic arbitration in India and the proposed
          clause (b) states that <a href="/doc/737017/" id="a_278">Sections 8</a>, <a href="/doc/1980619/" id="a_279">9</a>, <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_280">27</a>, <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_281">35</a> and <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_282">36</a> will be

<blockquote id="blockquote_67">           ―(xvii) It may be stated that it is the broad principle in
          International Commercial arbitration that a law of the country
          where it is held, namely, the Seat or forum or laws arbitri of
          the arbitration, governs the arbitration. However, if all the
          provisions of Part I are not made applicable to International
          Commercial arbitration where the seat of arbitration is not in
          India, some practical problems are arising. There may be
          cases where the properties and assets of a party to arbitration
          may be in India. <a href="/doc/1980619/" id="a_289">Section 9</a> of the Act which falls in Part I
          provide for interim measures by the Court. As per <a href="/doc/1980619/" id="a_290">Section 9</a>, a
          party may, apply to a court for certain interim measures of
          protection including for preservation, interim custody or sale
          of goods, securing the amount in disputes, detention,
          preservation or inspection of any property, interim injunction
          etc. If provision of <a href="/doc/1980619/" id="a_291">Section 9</a> is not made applicable to
          International Commercial arbitration where seat of arbitration
          is not in India, a party may be out of remedy if the assets and
          property are in India. In cases of international arbitration
          where the seat of arbitration is outside India, a serious
          controversy has arisen in the Indian Courts. These are cases
          where interim measures could not be granted by Indian courts
          under <a href="/doc/1980619/" id="a_292">Section 9</a> to an Indian national before commencement
          of arbitration (or after the award) against property of a foreign
          party. By the time the Indian party takes steps to move the
          courts in the country in which the seat of arbitration is
          located, the property may have been removed or transferred.‖

amendments to <a href="/doc/1360825/" id="a_293">Section 2</a> (2) of the Act (as quoted herein before) as it felt

that the same were necessary. The reasons for such amendments were

explained, as under:-
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_69">          ―(i) Where the assets of a party are located in India, and there
          is a likelihood that that party will dissipate its assets in the
          near future, the other party will lack an efficacious remedy if
          the seat of the arbitration is abroad. The latter party will have
          two possible remedies, but neither will be efficacious. First,


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_57">O.M.P.(I) (COMM.) 23/2015                                             Page 57 of 65</span>
           the latter party can obtain an interim order from a foreign
          Court or the arbitral tribunal itself and file a civil suit to
          enforce the right created by the interim order. The interim
          order would not be enforceable directly by filing an execution
          petition as it would not qualify as a "judgment" or "decree"
          for the purposes of sections 13 and 44A of the Code of Civil
          Procedure (which provide a mechanism for enforcing foreign
          judgments). Secondly, in the event that the former party does
          not adhere to the terms of the foreign Order, the latter party
          can initiate proceedings for contempt in the foreign Court and
          enforce the judgment of the foreign Court under sections 13
          and 44A of the Code of Civil Procedure. Neither of these
          remedies is likely to provide a practical remedy to the party
          seeking to enforce the interim relief obtained by it.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_70">          That being the case, it is a distinct possibility that a foreign
          party would obtain an arbitral award in its favour only to
          realize that the entity against which it has to enforce the
          award has been stripped of its assets and has been converted
          into a shell company.

<blockquote id="blockquote_71">          (ii) While the decision in BALCO was made prospective to
          ensure that hotly negotiated bargains are not overturned
          overnight, it results in a situation where Courts, despite
          knowing that the decision in Bhatia is no longer good law, are
          forced to apply it whenever they are faced with a case arising

</p>
<p id="p_168">96.     In the circumstances, the contention that the parties by agreeing that

the proper law applicable to arbitration would be the law in Singapore have

excluded the applicability of <a href="/doc/1980619/" id="a_317">Section 9</a> of the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_169">97.     The only question that now remains to be considered is whether the

petitioner can approach this Court for an interim relief considering that it

has already approached the Arbitral Tribunal in Singapore and thereafter,

also obtained a judgment in terms of the interim order from the Singapore

High Court.
</p>
<p id="p_170">98.     It is relevant to mention that <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_318">Article 17H</a> of the UNCITRAL Model

Law contains express provisions for enforcement of interim measures.

However the Act does not contain any provision pari materia to <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_319">Article

17H</a> for enforcement of interim orders granted by an Arbitral Tribunal

outside the India. <a href="/doc/1908442/" id="a_320">Section 17</a> of the Act is clearly not applicable in respect

of arbitral proceedings held outside India.
</p>
<p id="p_171">
</p><p id="p_172">99.     In the circumstances, the emergency award passed by the Arbitral

Tribunal cannot be enforced under the Act and the only method for

enforcing the same would be for the petitioner to file a suit.

</p><p id="p_173"> 100. However, in my view, a party seeking interim measures cannot be

precluded from doing so only for the reason that it had obtained a similar

order from an arbitral tribunal. Needless to state that the question whether

the interim orders should be granted under <a href="/doc/1980619/" id="a_321">section 9</a> of the Act or not

would have to be considered by the Courts independent of the orders

passed by the arbitral tribunal. Recourse to <a href="/doc/1980619/" id="a_322">Section 9</a> of the Act is not

available for the purpose of enforcing the orders of the arbitral tribunal;

but that does not mean that the Court cannot independently apply its mind

and grant interim relief in cases where it is warranted.


</p><p id="p_174">101. It is relevant to note that the provisions under <a href="/doc/1987997/" id="a_323">Article 17</a> I (2) of the

Model Law, the court enforcing an interim order passed by an Arbitral

Tribunal in prescribed form undertakes a review of the substance of interim

measure the Model Law. To that extent, a Court while examining a similar

relief under <a href="/doc/1980619/" id="a_324">Section 9</a> of the Act would be unfettered by the findings or the

view of the Arbitral Tribunal.

</p><p id="p_176">102. The decisions of this Court in Sri Krishan (supra) and <a href="/doc/23371010/" id="a_325">Indiabulls

Financial Services Ltd. &amp; Ors. v. Jubilee Plots and Housing Private Ltd</a>.:

2009 SCC OnLine Del 2458 referred to by Mr Dutt have no applicability

in the facts of this case. In those cases, it was held that a person disobeying

the orders passed under <a href="/doc/1908442/" id="a_326">Section 17</a> of the Act would be guilty of contempt


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_64">O.M.P.(I) (COMM.) 23/2015                                           Page 64 of 65</span>
 as provided under <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_327">Section 27</a> (5) of the Act. Clearly, a person guilty of not

following the interim orders of the arbitral tribunal in Singapore cannot be

proceeded for the contempt under <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_328">Section 27</a> of the Act, as contended by

Mr Dutt.

maintainable and accordingly, it is to be considered on its merits.
