</pre>
<p id="p_1">     Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners and

the learned High Court Government Pleader for the

respondent - State.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">       2.   The present petition is filed under <a href="/doc/1290514/" id="a_2">Section

439</a> of Cr.P.C. by the petitioners seeking regular bail in

Crime No.325/2017 of Shorapur Police Station.        The

offences alleged against the petitioners are punishable

under <a href="/doc/872363/" id="a_3">Sections 143</a>, <a href="/doc/1154131/" id="a_4">147</a>, <a href="/doc/791362/" id="a_5">148</a>, <a href="/doc/770961/" id="a_6">323</a>, <a href="/doc/267625/" id="a_7">324</a>, <a href="/doc/1429623/" id="a_8">336</a>, <a href="/doc/647828/" id="a_9">307</a>, <a href="/doc/1417508/" id="a_10">308</a>,

Atrocities) Act.
</p>
<p id="p_4">
</p><p id="p_5">       3.   In order to save judicial time, the substance

of the complaint is extracted from the order passed by
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                            5</span>


the learned District and Sessions Court, Yadgir which

are as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_6">
</p><p id="p_7">     It reveals from the averments of the complaint that

on   17.11.2017   at   about   11.30   p.m.   when   the

complainant and his friends were in the courtyard of

Vasant Mahel about 30 persons having a group formed

in to an unlawful assembly and thrown stones and

abused them and due to fear they entered inside their

houses and at that time all the accused persons having

iron rods and sickles entered the gate of the said house

with an intention to kill them and assaulted the

complainant with a sickle and also assaulted with a

Talwar on his head and the accused have also assaulted

Uday Kumar with an iron rod and stones and thrown

chilly powder and accused Nos.6 and 7 have also

assaulted them with an iron rod knowing fully well that

they will cause death with an intention to commit

murder, which clearly indicates the overt-acts attributed
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                 6</span>


against the above said accused persons and they are

involved in this case.
</p>
<p id="p_8">
</p><p id="p_9">      4.   There are 15 accused persons who are in

judicial custody.
</p>
<p id="p_10">
</p><p id="p_11">      5.   Learned counsel for the petitioners submits

that even a reading of the complaint without cross-

examining the complainant, would reflect that the

version is exaggerated.     He further submits that the

accused persons who are the petitioners in this case do

not have criminal background and the case is registered

as a mark of vengeance of a false complaint filed by the

complainant with a political vengeance as an vendetta

against the petitioner.    He would further submit that

the aggressor complainant is also in judicial custody.


</p><p id="p_12">      6.   Learned       HCGP       would   submit   that   the

petitioners have shown scant respect to the law and

order or peace and tranquility in the society by
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                              7</span>


committing the heinous offence. Hence, he opposes the

petition and seeks for dismissal of the same.


</p><p id="p_13">     7.     In the context and circumstances of the

case, no prejudice would be caused to the prosecution

or its case if the petitioners are enlarged on bail.

However, the apprehension of the prosecution could be

resolved by imposing suitable conditions.


</p><p id="p_14">     8.     Accordingly, the petition under <a href="/doc/1290514/" id="a_15">Section 439</a>

of Cr.P.C. is allowed and the petitioners are enlarged on

bail, subject to the following conditions:


</p><p id="p_15">  a) Petitioners shall be released on bail in Crime
     No.325/2017 on each of them executing a
     personal bond for a sum of Rs.50,000/- each
     and a separate surety each for the likesum to
     the satisfaction of the concerned Court.

</p><p id="p_16">  b) They    shall   not   tamper   or   terrorize   the
     prosecution witnesses in any manner.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                               8</span>


</p><p id="p_17">   c) They shall not        leave   the   jurisdiction of
      Karnataka State until further orders by the
      trial Court.
</p>
<p id="p_18">   d) In order to avoid disturbance and crowd,
      petitioner Nos.1 to 5 shall mark their
      attendance before the Investigating Officer
      between 9.00 p.m. and 10.00 p.m. on every
      Monday, petitioner Nos.6 to 10 shall mark
      their attendance before the Investigating
      Officer between 9.00 p.m. and 10.00 p.m. on
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">      every Wednesday and petitioner Nos.11 to 15</span>
      shall mark their attendance           before   the
      Investigating Officer between 9.00 p.m. and
      10.00 p.m. on every Friday till further orders
      by the trial Court.
</p>
<p id="p_19">      If the petitioners violate any of the conditions, the

prosecution is at liberty to seek for cancellation of bail.
