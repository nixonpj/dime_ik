                                    BEFORE
                       HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE UJJAL BHUYAN

                                           ORDER
</pre><p id="p_1">Date : 19-02-2019

      Heard Mr. A. R. Bhuyan, learned counsel for the petitioner and Mr. N. Goswami,
      learned Govt. Advocate, Assam.
</p><p id="p_2">      By filing this petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_2">Article 226</a>, petitioner seeks a direction to the respondents
to conduct fresh enquiry into Bihpuria PS Case No.2/2006 by either constituting a Special
Investigating Team (SIT) or through the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).
</p>
<p id="p_3">      Case of the petitioner is that her husband, Lila Kanta Deuri, was Manager of Subansiri
Gaonlia Bank, North Lakhimpur. He was also the Chief Advisor of Deuri Autonomy Demand
Committee, an organization formed to demand autonomy for people belonging to the Deuri
tribe in the State of Assam. In course of time, a rival organization, namely, All Assam Deuri
Autonomous Demand Committee was also formed. An understanding was reached between
the Deuri Autonomy Demand Committee and the Government of Assam whereafter Deuri
Autonomous Council was established by enacting Deuri Autonomous Council Act, 2005.
</p>
<p id="p_4">      It appears that some dispute arose regarding constitution of interim council.
</p>
<p id="p_5">      According to the petitioner, office bearers of the rival organization hatched a
conspiracy to kill her husband.
</p>
<p id="p_6">      On 03.01.2006 at about 8 am while husband of the petitioner was on his way to work,
he was abducted by the activists of All Assam Deuri Autonomous Demand Committee. In this
connection, first information was lodged on 03.01.2006 before Bihpuria Police Station
mentioning the names of 7 accused persons who had allegedly abducted the husband of the
petitioner. On the next day, dead-body of the husband was recovered.
</p>
<p id="p_7">      On the basis of the first information lodged, Bihpuria Police Station Case No.2/2006
was registered under <a href="/doc/1096965/" id="a_3">Sections 143</a>/<a href="/doc/1897847/" id="a_4">120B</a>/<a href="/doc/886598/" id="a_5">365</a> IPC read with <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_6">Sections 302</a>/<a href="/doc/386021/" id="a_7">201</a> IPC.
</p>
<p id="p_8">      Police investigated the case and arrested the accused persons.
</p>
<p id="p_9">      On completion of investigation, police submitted charge-sheet being Charge-Sheet
                                                                                      Page No.# 3/4

No.134/2006 dated 27.10.2006 in the Court of Chief Judicial Magistrate, North Lakhimpur
naming only those who were arrested as accused forwarding them to face trial but excluding
those who could not be arrested. According to the petitioner, main conspirators were not
charge-sheeted.
</p>
<p id="p_10">      It is in such circumstances that the present writ petition came to be filed.
</p>
<p id="p_11">      Notice in this case was issued way-back on 14.11.2008.
</p>
<p id="p_12">      From the documents placed on record, it is seen that being a sessions triable case,
learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, North Lakhimpur committed the case to the Court of
learned Sessions Judge, North Lakhimpur for trial whereafter it was registered as Sessions
Case No.(NL) 38/2008 under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_8">Sections 302</a>/<a href="/doc/386021/" id="a_9">201</a>/<a href="/doc/1096965/" id="a_10">143</a>/ <a href="/doc/1897847/" id="a_11">120B</a>/<a href="/doc/1783774/" id="a_12">265</a> IPC.
</p>
<p id="p_13">      Today when the matter is called upon, Mr. Bhuyan submits that he has no specific
information about the case but from what he could gather, Sessions Case No.(NL) 38/2008
ended in the conviction of the accused persons. The convicts have preferred appeal before
this Court which appears to be pending.
</p>
<p id="p_14">      Mr. Goswami, learned Govt. Advocate, submits that having regard to the sequence of
events as mentioned above, perhaps acceding to the prayer of the petitioner at this stage
may not arise. The competent Court has adjudicated the criminal trial whereafter accused
persons have been convicted. Further order(s) in this proceeding may not be warranted.
</p>
<p id="p_15">      Court has made its own enquiry wherefrom it is found that all the 7 accused in
Sessions Case No.38(NL)/2008, viz, Sri Civil Deori, Sri Robin Deori, Sri Hari Prasad Deori, Sri
Promod Deori, Sri Mahesh Deori, Sri Kumar Deori and Sri Rajesh Deori were convicted vide
the judgment and order dated 16.10.2015 and sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment
for life for the conviction under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_13">Section 302</a> IPC with relatively minor sentences for conviction
under the other Sections. It further appears that against such conviction and sentence, the
convicts have preferred Criminal Appeal Nos.297 and 303 of 2015 before this Court which are
pending.
</p><p id="p_16">                                                                                      Page No.# 4/4



      In view of above, no further order is called for. Accordingly, writ petition is closed.
</p>
