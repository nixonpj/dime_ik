registered as a Society with the Registrar of Societies at Madras (now




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">FAO 203/2016                                                              Page 1 of 23</span>
 Chennai) with Registration No. 110/1987. Disputes arose between respondent
no.1 and the other members of the Executive Committee (EC) of the
Federation which led to filing of a suit by the said respondent before the
Courts at Delhi. The relief sought therein was declined in March, 2016.
</p><p id="p_8">3.     In January 2016 the respondent allegedly informed the EC of the
Federation that he had decided to engage a private company to sponsor the
Indian Volleyball League for which he had received an amount of Rs. 10.60
crores from the said company. The said unilateral decision was questioned by
the EC, but respondent no.1 persisted that the Federation ought to enter into
the agreement with the company identified by him. The following month
respondent no.1 dissolved the core committee formed by the EC by an email
communication and intimated that he had already executed an agreement with
the private company he had chosen and had also received sponsorship fee for
the same. Two days after the aforesaid dissolution, the Core Committee of the
Federation met on 22.02.2016 and accepted a bid by another private company
for the sponsorship. Simultaneously, the EC also requested respondent no.1 to
call for a Special General Body Meeting/ Extraordinary General Body Meeting
on 11.03.2016 in order to assess the conduct and doubtful activities of the
respondent.    Two days later, i.e. on 24.02.2016 respondent no.1 unilaterally
declared publically that the Indian Volleyball League in conjunction with the
private company he had chosen had been launched as its sponsor. It is another
matter though that the Federation i.e. the other Members of the EC did not
approve the association with the said private sponsor.        On 25.02.2016
respondent no.1 called for a parallel meeting to be conducted on 03.03.2016 at
Nagpur. Simultaneously, the EC called for another emergent meeting on
03.03.2016. Show cause notice too was issued to respondent no.1 apropos the



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">FAO 203/2016                                                     Page 2 of 23</span>
 cases mentioned in the said notice. No response was received to the same.
Thereafter, on the same day respondent no.1 suspended all office bearers who
had questioned his actions. He issued notice suspending fourteen members of
the EC and also suspended 10 of the 29 State Units without according any
opportunity to them. According to the petitioner the only sin of the said
persons was that, that they had dissented with the opinion/ decision/ action of
respondent no.1 and for having participated in the meeting held on 22.02.2016.
</p><p id="p_9">4.     Aggrieved with the decision taken in the meeting on 01.03.2016
respondent no.1 sought an injunction against the same in Suit No. 203/2016 in
a Delhi Court.    He sought an injunction against the decision of the EC
declining to approve the sponsorship with the private company chosen by
respondent no.1 and instead of which the EC had awarded the IVL sponsorship
to another private company. The relief sought was never granted, however,
the very next day on 02.03.2016 the Federation through its EC filed an
Original Application under <a href="/doc/1120409/" id="a_3">Section 9</a> of the Act being no. 123/2016 (OA)
before the Madras High Court seeking a stay on the suspension of the office
bearers of the Federation and State Union announced by respondent no.1 as
well as an injunction restraining him from holding a parallel meeting on
03.03.2016 at Nagpur. On 02.03.2016 the Madras High Court directed that the
decision of the meeting scheduled to be held the following day, would be
subject to the outcome of the OA proceedings. A communication to that effect
was issued to respondent no.1. Relief sought by the petitioner in suit no.
203/2016 was declined. The Delhi Court had noted that respondent no.1 had
the liberty to participate in the Emergency EC Meeting scheduled on the next
day at Chennai.
</p><p id="p_10">5.     The aforesaid meeting was convened on the next day i.e. 03.03.2016 at



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">FAO 203/2016                                                     Page 3 of 23</span>
 11.00 a.m. The members present waited for respondent no.1 to participate and
waited for 45 minutes for him to turn up and participate, but he did not do so.
In default of his appearance or any communication, the committee chose the
Vice-President of the Federation as its Chairman and proceeded to conduct the
meeting as per its bye-laws. It revoked the purported suspensions issued and
declared by respondent no.1 and removed him from the post of President, for
his various acts, which the committee deemed to be high-handed, illegal and
laced with impropriety. The agreement of respondent no.1 with the private
sponsorship entity too was declared void.      Subsequently, in the Special/
Extraordinary General Body Meeting held on 11.03.2016 a decision was taken
to hold fresh elections under Mr. Justice Rajeshwaran, retired Judge of the
Madras High Court as the Returning Officer. He consented to conduct the
elections.     Requisite notifications commencing the election process were
issued by him on the same day and posted on the official website of the
Federation.
</p><p id="p_11">6.     Meanwhile respondent no.1 on 19.03.2016 filed an application under
<a href="/doc/1120409/" id="a_4">Section 9</a> of the Act in Delhi seeking a stay on the resolutions passed on
03.03.2016 and 11.03.2016. The election process was stayed on 21.03.2016 in
the said petition.     According to the appellant, while respondent no.1
communicated the order dated 21.03.2016 to the Federation by email, he
defaulted in complying with the provisions of Order 39 Rule 4 CPC by not
providing a copy of the pleadings and documents filed along with it.
Aggrieved by the same, the appellant challenged the stay order of 21.03.2016
by way of an appeal being FAO No. 146/2016. By order dated 08.04.2016 in
the said appeal, the elections were permitted to be conducted as originally
scheduled. However, the results thereof were directed to filed in a sealed



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">FAO 203/2016                                                     Page 4 of 23</span>
 cover before the Trial Court as well as before this Court. Additionally, on
07.04.2016 they raised preliminary objections apropos the jurisdiction of the
Trial Court to have passed the impugned stay order on 21.03.2016, however,
the case was adjourned to 19.04.2016.
</p><p id="p_12">7.     The elections were conducted. Its results were not declared but were
kept in a sealed cover before this Court and the Trial Court on 13.04.2016 and
19.04.2016 respectively.      On the latter date, the appellant‟s preliminary
objection to jurisdiction was argued and order was reserved. The appellant‟s
grievance was that the impugned order instead of adjudicating only on the
issue of jurisdiction, went on to not only reject the said objection but also
decided the case on merits.
</p><p id="p_13">8.     The petitioners have impugned the said order on the following grounds:
</p><p id="p_14">(i) the <a href="/doc/1120409/" id="a_5">section 9</a> petition in Delhi was not maintainable because apropos the
same arbitration agreement a motion under <a href="/doc/1120409/" id="a_6">Section 9</a> of the Act had already
been initiated before the Madras High Court on 02.03.2016, hence the
subsequent <a href="/doc/1120409/" id="a_7">Section 9</a> petition filed by respondent no.1, seventeen days later on
19.03.2016 was barred under <a href="/doc/1937908/" id="a_8">section 42</a> of the Act; (ii) the Delhi Courts had
no territorial jurisdiction to entertain the petition because respondent nos. 2, 3
&amp; 4 were not relevant for adjudication of any dispute with the Federation
which has its registered office at Jawahar Lal Nehru Stadium, Chennai,; (iii)
the appellants had argued and filed a written synopsis on the issue of
jurisdiction of the Trial Court, to entertain the <a href="/doc/1120409/" id="a_9">Section 9</a> application and had
not addressed the merits of the matter in detail, and thus they were denied the
opportunity to put their case fully before the said court and would still want an
opportunity to argue the case before the Court on merits. However, the
impugned order adjudicated the case not only on jurisdiction but on merits as



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">FAO 203/2016                                                        Page 5 of 23</span>
 well.
</p><p id="p_15">9.      On 27.04.2017, this Court had noted as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">         "..... 3. Fresh elections on 11.4.2016 were conducted by
         Volleyball Federation of India pursuant to the order dated
         8.4.2016 passed by the learned single Judge of this Court in
         FAO No. 146/2016. Results of the elections are kept in a sealed
         cover and which sealed cover is lying in this Court in FAO
         No.146/2016. Effectively therefore on account of non-
         declaration of results the entire operation of the Volleyball
         Federation of India has come to a standstill as rightly argued on
         behalf of the appellants although the issue in these proceedings
         is only as regards the rights of the respondent no.1 to the post of
         President of Volleyball Federation of India and not for the 28
         other posts.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">                4. In fact I find that the respondent no. 1 (petitioner in the
         petition under Section 9 of the Act) is trying to bite of much
         beyond what he can chew because I fail to understand that in
         spite of repeated queries to the respondent no.1 that the locus
         standi of the respondent no. 1 is only to seek his continuation as
         a President as per the earlier elections held for a period of four
         years and which period would expire soon in around the middle
         of July 2017 as per the case of the respondent no. 1 himself, yet
         the counsel argues that results of even the 28 other posts be not
         declared. Therefore, the arguments and contentions urged on
         behalf of the respondent no.1 are only to stall the complete
         elections and are thus most mala fide and amounts to making a
         prayer to overreach the court. Whether the actions of the
         respondent no.1 amount to contempt of court would be examined
         on the next date of hearing, however, for the present the
         impugned order dated 27.4.2016 passed by the court below is
         clarified that by this order dated 27.4.2016 it is not held and nor
         could it have been held that election results of the Volleyball
         Federation of India for even the 28 other posts, and to which
         posts there are no disputes by the existing holders of these posts
         or the new holders of the posts who would occupy the same on
         results being declared, would be halted. The operative portion of
         the impugned order is contained in para 22 of the impugned

               and he has not been ousted by following the mandate of
               the Constitution. Therefore he is entitled to preside over
               the federation in the capacity of elected President of the

an application filed by the appellants on 02.03.2016 under <a href="/doc/1120409/" id="a_12">section 9</a> of the Act.
The said OA was filed by the Federation through the Secretary General (the

taken in the meeting to be conducted on 03.03.2016 or any date, either by the

only meeting that was held was at Madras. Respondent no.1 unfairly sought to
create jurisdiction in Delhi by impleading respondent nos. 2, 3 &amp; 4, who have

4</a> of the Act would be applicable only when the parties are the same and when
the arbitration agreement and the arbitral proceedings too, are the same. He
argues that the arbitration proceedings before the Madras High Court in OA
No. 123/2016 dealt with a different subject matter, between the different
parties than the ones which were before the Trial Court at Delhi. This Court,
however, is unable to agree with the said contention in view of the preceding
comparison of the reliefs sought in both the <a href="/doc/1120409/" id="a_20">Section 9</a> proceedings - and in
view of the Statement of Claim and Statement of Defence as mentioned
hereinabove.
</p><p id="p_27">20.    The learned counsel argues that in terms of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_21">article (x)</a> and <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_22">(viii)(b)</a> the
arbitration agreement had not been defined between the parties; each dispute
raised by different parties is to be dealt with on a case to case basis; whether
the disputes are the same is to be determined in each case. Indeed the said
article contains four different kinds of disputes: (a) between the Federation and
its constituent members; (b) between the office bearers of the Federation and
the Federation; (c) between the constituent members inter se, and (iv) between
office bearers of the Federation. He argues that OA No. 123/2016 relates to a




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">FAO 203/2016                                                       Page 14 of 23</span>
 dispute between the Federation and its office bearers, whereas the dispute in
the present case is between the office bearers of the Federation. Hence, the
two cannot be deemed to be the same dispute. He argues that in the present
case the parties are different because respondent nos. 2. 3 &amp; 4 are not parties to
OA No. 123/2016. The Federation is not a party to the present proceedings
unlike the <a href="/doc/1120409/" id="a_23">Section 9</a> petition initiated by the Federation itself before the
Madras High Court. He contends that in view of the above, it cannot be said
that the arbitral proceedings under <a href="/doc/1937908/" id="a_24">Section 42</a> of the Act are the same in the
present case.
</p><p id="p_28">21.    On "cause of action" the learned counsel relies upon the dicta in
<a href="/doc/486081/" id="a_25">Alchemist Ltd. &amp; Anr. vs State Bank of Sikkim &amp; Ors</a>. (2007) 11 SCC 335.
The Court would note that the said case dealt with a Writ Petition under
<a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_26">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India and not with proceedings under the
<a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_27">Arbitration Act</a>, it held to the effect that whether a particular fact constitutes a
cause of action or not must be decided on the basis of the facts and
circumstances of each case. The test is to see whether a particular fact(s) is
(are) of substance and can be said to be material, integral or essential part of
the lis between the parties. If it is, it forms a part of the cause of action. If it is
not, it does not form a part of the cause of action. It also held that in
determining the question, the substance of the matter and not the form thereof
has to be considered.
</p><p id="p_29">22.    Applying the aforesaid tests to the issues which were before the Madras
High Court in OA No. 123/2016, and in the subsequent application before the
Trial Court at Delhi, what emanates is that both proceedings were based on the
cause of action emerging from a decision of the present appellant to call a
meeting at Chennai on 03.03.2016 and the decisions which were taken in the



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">FAO 203/2016                                                            Page 15 of 23</span>
 said meeting. The respondent no.1 is also aggrieved by the said decisions and
simply arraying respondent nos. 2, 3 &amp; 4 in the present proceedings would not
alter the substance of the matter. The addition of the said three parties i.e.
respondent nos. 2, 3 &amp; 4 at the whims and fancies of respondent no.2 will only
change the format of the petition but will not and cannot change the
substratum and essential dispute being considered both at the Madras High
Court as well as in the <a href="/doc/1120409/" id="a_28">Section 9</a> petition of respondent no.1.           Just as
respondent no.1 had impleaded respondent nos. 2 to 4 as parties, it could well
have impleaded the Federation itself as a necessary party. Such impleadment
would not make the proceedings in Delhi so different in form and substance as
to distinguish the essence of the lis in both the proceedings. The respondent
also relies upon the decision of the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/107528107/" id="a_29">State of West Bengal &amp;
Ors. vs Associated Contractors</a> (2015) 1 SCC 32, which held inter alia as
under:

         which is not a Principal Civil Court of original jurisdiction in

         if the same had been the subject matter of a suit, then
         obviously such application would be outside the four corners
         of Section 42. If, for example, an application were to be filed
         in a court inferior to a Principal Civil Court, or to a High
         Court which has no original jurisdiction, or if an application
         were to be made to a court which has no subject-matter

<blockquote id="blockquote_31">23.    The Court is unable to see how reference to the aforesaid case would
assist respondent no.1 because the meeting was held in Chennai, therefore, the
High Court having jurisdiction over that area would have jurisdiction. Indeed
by virtue of the aforesaid para 25(g), the Madras High Court would clearly
have original jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1937908/" id="a_33">Section 42</a> of the Act.     The respondent also
relies upon the decision of the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/75853915/" id="a_34">Indus Mobile Distribution
Pvt. Ltd vs Datawind Innovations Pvt. Ltd</a>. (2017) 7 SCC 678 to contend that
where a „seat‟ of arbitration is designated, it will be akin to the Courts
exercising supervisory powers over the arbitration. In the aforesaid case,
interim injunction had been granted by the Court in Delhi in favour of the
petitioner. While holding that, the Court at Mumbai alone had jurisdiction and
not the Delhi Court but in allowing the interim injunction to continue for a
period of four weeks, the Supreme Court held that if the Delhi Court did not
have jurisdiction in the first place it could not have passed the interim
injunction and this jurisdiction would lie exclusively with the Courts in
Mumbai since that was the juridical seat of arbitration.

issue sought to be adjudicated by respondent no.1 in the proceedings before
the Delhi Courts. From a comparison of the aforesaid relief sought before
Chennai and in Delhi what clearly emanates is that the first proceeding at
Chennai clearly covered all the reliefs sought by respondent no.1, therefore,

 under <a href="/doc/1937908/" id="a_35">Section 42</a> of the Act, as well as in view of the bar under the said
section, the Madras Court would clearly have original jurisdiction in the matter
and the subsequent proceedings in the present case would not be maintainable.
The reasoning of the impugned order that jurisdiction of the Delhi Court was
not barred since no arbitral proceedings had commenced in terms of <a href="/doc/1120409/" id="a_36">Section 9</a>
sub-section (ii) within 90 days of such reference and, therefore, there would be
no bar to arbitral proceedings in Delhi, is erroneous because <a href="/doc/1937908/" id="a_37">Section 42</a> of the
Act confers exclusive jurisdiction on that Court alone before which an
application under <a href="/doc/1120409/" id="a_38">Section 9</a> had been made, under the arbitration agreement
and that Court shall have jurisdiction over the arbitral proceedings and over all
subsequent applications arising out of that agreement. <a href="/doc/1937908/" id="a_39">Section 42</a> of the Act
reads as under:

necessarily have to go before the same Court where the first <a href="/doc/1120409/" id="a_40">Section 9</a>
proceedings were initiated between the parties under the same arbitral
agreement. The respondent‟s contention that agreement itself is not defined, is
untenable because he himself refers to the same arbitral agreement, the
Constitution and bye-laws of the Federation to delineate various kinds of
disputes illustrated therein.

<p id="p_32"> 26.    The appellants have referred to the decision of the Madras High Court
which disposed of three applications, one of which was preferred by
respondent no.1 against the Federation through its General Secretary, the
present appellant, against the order of the learned Arbitrator dated 19.10.2016.
While disposing of the said applications, the Madras High Court dealt with all
the issues raised in the petition apropos the decision taken in the meeting held
at Madras on 03.03.2016. It held inter alia as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_33">               "..... 29.1 The order passed does not in any way violate the
               interim order passed by the Patiala House Court that
               enabled the appellant to continue as President of VFI.
               However, does that by any token grant the appellant any
               exclusive right to operate, or run VFI by sidelining the
               Executive Committee or General Council? At least not in
               terms of the Constitution and Bylaw of the VFI. Article VIII
               thereof deals with the Duties and 30 Powers of the Executive
               Committee. Article VIII(5) enjoins the Executive Committee
               with the power or duty "to conduct and administer the day to
               day work of the Federation and to form standing sub-
               committee and such other sub-committees as may be
               considered necessary and define and determine their powers,
               duties, scope and terms of reference unless otherwise
               provided for." When compared with the Executive
               Committee, under Article XI Duties and Powers of the
               President are chiefly emergency or supreme emergency
               powers, and Article XI( 4) insists that they shall be exercised
               only in the interest of the Federation (i.e. VFI). Under Article
               XI(2)and (6) such of the powers that the President exercises
               should be approve d or confirmed by the Executive
               Committee. In other words, the Office of the President of VFI
               carries an implied duty to report to the Executive Committee
               to a substantial extent. It is therefore apparent that the
               President of VFI within the scheme of its Constitution and
               Bylaw has no greater authority or power than the Executive
               Committee, and wherever he is granted independent powers
               they have to be exercised only in case of emergency or

                supreme emergency as the case may be, and that too only in
               circumstances where the interest of the VFI is in peril, and
               not otherwise.

               attempted to explain or justify that his actions to which the
               respondents are taking exceptions to, were done in the best
               interest of the VFI, nor has he 31 explained the pre-dominant
               interest of the VFI that he was anxious to secure, and/or
               alleged that the arbitrator has faulted in overlooking the

               by its constitution or bylaw to preside over its affairs cannot
               ignore the spirit of the democratic principles that govern it.
               After all, VFI is not the personal property of its President or
               any of its other office bearers, or of the Committee created
               for its governance under its bylaw. It would have been
               appropriate if the appellant had attempted to convene the
               Executive Committee or the General Council, mustered
               support for his views or plan of actions and acted. Between
               an individual and the institution of which he is a member or
               an office bearer, the interest of the institution must always be
               considered paramount. Any position enjoined with duty to
               any democratically run body such as a Society, or a club, or
               any association of persons is fiduciary in character, and
               anyone who holds such position is bound by the obligations
               arising out of a fiduciary relationship. They are but trustees
               of the institution in general and of those members who have
               elected them in particular. They have been granted powers
               only for performing their duties to the institution whose
               affairs they manage for the time being. The order of the
               arbitrator reflects this principle broadly while granting
               prayer (b) of I.A.1/2016 and it is therefore in order, and it is
               not inconsistent with any of the principles that govern the
               grant of interim order by an arbitrator, more particularly in
               a case of individual Vs Institution......

               here too. Further, the attitude and conduct of the appellant
               that was on display prima facie would not inspire confidence
               in the mind of the right thinking. They hardly reconcile with
               the responsibility that he owe d the VFI by virtue of his office.
               33 Otherwise, how to explain why he informed the Executive
               Committee that he had not signed any contract with SLE, why
               he suddenly pulled a surprise on the Executive Committee
               with his announcement that he had signed the contract at
               least a month before, why he participated in the decision to
               form a Core Committee to select a sponsor and why he
               dissolve d it unilaterally without taking the Executive
               Committee into confidence when the object for which the

               of VFI that he, in his capacity as the President of VFI, has
               pursued with his wild swinging patterns?

               continue to remain as an unresolved plot that the appellant
               has scripted and put up in exhibition. Now when it has all
               started? Was it not when the VFI contemplated on a IVL and
               searched for a sponsor? Why the IVL as an idea should inject
               faction? What is playing the spoilsport - Is it the sport, or the
               sponsorship? Why is the appellant hyper anxious to take on
               the Executive Committee of the Federation on the choice of
               the sponsor? Why is he hesitant to abide by the views of the
               majority in the Executive Committee? What is the rationale
               behind his actions? Not one was explained. It is this failure
               to explain any of them, and this inability to deny their factual
               content exposes the key to his cryptic puzzle and unravels the
               34 plot within. Why fault the arbitrator, when the appellant
               himself has unloaded unexplainable deeds of uninspiring
               quality before the arbitrator? The conduct of the appellant is
               not beyond blames and lacks bonafides.

               this Court as to the merit of anyone of the three appeals that
               he has filed. Consequently he fails in all the three appeals.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_40">               33. Before dropping the curtains on this case, it requires to
               be recorded with immense anguish that those who litigate
               here appear to betray the interest of thousands of volleyball
               players in this country, the dreams they carry and the hopes
               this country holds. Under what authority is the sporting
               talent the country possesses is paralysed? Are they not the
               assets of our country, however short its duration might be?
               Somewhere in the voluminous papers mad e available it is
               indicated that the Asian Volleyball Confederation has banned
               all the international activities of the VFI, and during the
               pendency of these appeals before me, it is informed that the
               Sports Ministry of Government of India is said to have
               derecognised the VFI as it is embroiled in litigation. The
               factum of volleying litigation between those who avowed to
               protect and promote the game might be true, but what has the
               Sports Ministry done to arrest the damage? Rather than
               derecognising the Federation, why has it not attempted to
               involve itself in the mess and put the house in order? After
               all, in the General Council Meeting of the VFI dated 11-03-
               2016 in which the appellant was stripped off his office, a
               representative of Govt. of India was a participant. There is
               35 therefore in display irresponsibility of varying degrees
               and content that appears to control the attitude of all those
               who have something to do with the governance of this
               sporting body. Every sporting body and those who administer
               it should remember that long away from the comfort of the
               court halls and meeting rooms, there nurtures our children,
               men and women, spread across our countryside and cities, a
               dream of playing for the nation. Dreams such as these bind
               this nation, keep alive its spirits, and propel it to move to the
               generation next with energy amidst all the cynicism that we,
