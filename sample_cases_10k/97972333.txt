          Corporation          (HSMITC),    Haryana   State   Cooperative   Consumer

                           Therefore, the facts and circumstances of Deepak Sood case

                           and the case of Sh. Jai Kishan, ARC are different. It is

                           necessary to mention here that after the judgment of Supreme

                           Court of India in Deepak Sood case the whole issue was

                           examined by the Competent Authority i.e. Finance Department

                           and    accordingly    office    memorandum      bearing       letter

                           No.6/48/2009-PR(FD) dated 16.12.2010 has been issued

                           wherein all the provisions of service rules and different

                           incentive schemes introduced by the State Government form

                           time to form have been explained including provisions of ACP

                           scales if he is fit for promotion, whereas, Sh. Jai Kishan, ARC

                           is junior in the cadre and benefit of past service rendered by

                           him in Haryana State Minor Irrigation Tubewell Corporation

                           has not been given towards seniority. Therefore, he will be

                           entitled to the benefit of ACP Scale after the completion of 10

                           years regular satisfactory service from the date of his

                           appointment in the Irrigation Department. Therefore, claim of

                           Sh.   Jai   Kishan,   ARC      cannot   be   acceded   arid     his

                           representation dated 24.02.2011, which was received on

                           01.03.2011 is hereby rejected."

                           When rejecting their case, it was specifically noticed by the

          authorities that their case is not similar to the one set up by them

          because in those cases employees were taken into Government service

          by transfer/absorption from one department to another or from Public

          Sector          to   State   and   before   their   retrenchment,   retrenchment

          compensation was not given to them. Whereas in the case of

          appellants, they were sent out of service on account of Corporations, in

          which they were employed, going in loss and of which there was no

          chance of revival. It was also noticed that before their names were

          considered for re-employment, all the employees gave an undertaking

          that they would not claim benefit of past service. It is also not in dispute

          that the employees were not asked to re-deposit the compensation

          amount received by them with the State Authorities. The learned Single

          Judge has rightly, by taking note of ratio of judgment of the Supreme

          Court in <a href="/doc/773783/" id="a_11">State of Haryana v. Deepak Sood &amp; Others (Civil Appeal

          No</a>. 4446 of 2008, decided on 15.7.2008) said that condition imposed

          was not irrational and was perfectly justified. In the case of Deepak

          Sood (supra), there was no disruption in service. The employees were

          taken into service before closure of Corporation in which they were

          working. Retrenchment compensation was not paid to them.

          Roy and Others</a> 2013(2) S.C.T. 231 is also of no help to the present

          appellants. That was the case in which service of an employee was

          terminated in terms of conditions of services. That was not a case of

          closure of corporation and adjusting a retrenched employee. In the

          present case, Corporations in which the appellants were working went

          into loss. Those were closed. Retrenchment compensation was paid as

          per Rules and thereafter a favour was shown to the appellants by taking

          them back into service in a way denying opportunity of entry into service

          to large number of young persons. In the case of Balmer Lawrie

          (supra), situation was altogether different. Taking note of that case, it

          was said by the Supreme Court that service conditions need to be fair

          and reasonable. That was a case of entry in service. But in the present

          case, it is re-entry into service after retrenchment. Filing of an affidavit by

          the appellant not to claim past benefit was a condition precedent to get

          re-entry in service. It is not open for the appellants to challenge the

          same at this stage.
