CORAM:
HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE VALMIKI J.MEHTA

To be referred to the Reporter or not?           YES




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">RSA No. 78/2013 and RSA No. 94/2013                                 Page 1 of 20</span>
 VALMIKI J. MEHTA, J (ORAL)

</pre><p id="p_1">1.           These Regular Second Appeals under Section 100 of the Code of

Civil Procedure, 1908 (CPC) are filed against the concurrent Judgments of the

courts below; of the Trial Court dated 24.5.2011 and the First Appellate Court

dated 22.1.2013; by which the suits            for injunction filed by the

appellants/plaintiffs were dismissed. The claim in the suit was with respect to a

cause of action of the appellants/plaintiffs that the smaller portion JKLM

forming a part of gali DGHI admeasuring 60 sq. yards was a private gali of the

appellants/plaintiffs and in which the respondents no.1 and 2/defendants have

no right including for opening of any doors or ventilators in the gali. For the

sake of convenience reference is made to the facts of RSA No. 78/2013.


</p><p id="p_2">2.           The subject suit was filed by the plaintiffs pleading that they and

their predecessors-in-interest were owners of one bigha and one biswa of land

(1058 sq. yards) comprised in Khasra no. 511 of village Shahpur Jat, New

Delhi. It was pleaded that the original co-owners of this land had left a private

gali shown as DGHI in the site plan Ex.PW1/1. The disputed portion JKLM is

part of this private gali of 60 sq. yards and which area JKLM forms part of the

larger area DGHI. It is pleaded that the respondents no.1 and 2/defendants

never used the gali/private street DGHI and their ingress and egress is from the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">RSA No. 78/2013 and RSA No. 94/2013                                   Page 2 of 20</span>
 southern portion of their house which adjoins the public street wherein the

respondents no.1 and 2/defendants have their electricity meters, water meters,

etc. To the northern side of the house of the respondents no.1 and 2/defendants

is the subject private gali DGHI of the appellants/plaintiffs in which the

respondents no.1 and 2/defendants do not have any legal right whatsoever and

therefore even no right to open any door or window or ventilator opening in the

same, but, the respondents no.1 and 2/defendants have opened ventilators on the

property and are threatening to open a door on the ground floor of their property

which will have opening in the private gali which is to the north of the premises

owned by the respondents no.1 and 2/defendants, and have ultimately opened a

door opening on to the subject gali. Accordingly, injunction was prayed in the

suit by the appellants/plaintiffs to restrain the respondents no.1 and 2/defendants

from in any manner using the private street of the plaintiffs, including the

portion JKLM, whether by opening of ventilators or opening of door on the

ground floor of the property of the defendants which was three feet above the

street DGHI. The already opened door was prayed to be closed.


</p><p id="p_3">3.           Respondents no.1 and 2/defendants contested the suit and pleaded

that the street was a public street and hence appellants/plaintiffs could not claim

it to be a private street. Respondents no.1 and 2/defendants claim that there

were water lines, sewer lines, etc of the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD)



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">RSA No. 78/2013 and RSA No. 94/2013                                    Page 3 of 20</span>
 on the street DGHI and thus this street could not be a private street but was a

public street. It was also the case of the respondents no.1 and 2/defendants that

there was completely unhindered ingress and egress on to this street by all

persons and therefore this street DGHI could not be taken as a private street. It

was also pleaded that even the MCD also considers this street as a public street

because the municipal sweeper cleans this street. Accordingly, the suit was

prayed to be dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_4">
</p><p id="p_5">4.           After the pleadings were complete, the trial court on 21.2.2005

framed the following issues:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">     ―1.     Whether the suit is barred in view of PO no. 3? OPD
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">     2.      Whether the suit is not maintainable in view of PO no. 7? OPD
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">     3.      Whether the plaintiff is entitled to permanent injunction as prayed?
     OPP
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">     4.      Whether the plaintiff is entitled to mandatory injunction? OPP
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">     5.      Relief.‖


</blockquote><p id="p_6">5.           Issue no. 1 has been decided against the appellants/plaintiffs

relying on the admissions of PW2 and PW4 that the street is cleaned by the

municipal sweeper, that the street has sewer lines of the MCD and further that

there are also water lines in the street DGHI. Trial court also refers to the area

in question being an urbanized village with MCD providing amenities in the

area and also that fruit and vegetable venders use this street in an unrestricted

manner. It was also found by the trial court against the appellants/plaintiffs for


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">RSA No. 78/2013 and RSA No. 94/2013                                       Page 4 of 20</span>
 the street to be a private street because there was no chowkidar/guard appointed

by the appellants/plaintiffs to restrict the entry of outsiders in the street DGHI.

The relevant observations of the trial court in this regard for holding issue no. 1

against the appellants/plaintiffs read as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">     ―Issue no.1.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_7">     The onus of proving this issue was upon the defendant. To decide this issue it
     would be pertinent to refer to the relevant testimony of witnesses for a while.
     PW2 Sh. U.C. Sharma in his cross examination states, ―the sewer line installed in
     the houses of both sides of the houses are maintained by private parties. It is
     correct that there is no chokidar posted in the entrance of the disputed street to
     cheque the entry of the private persons/ public. .... The water connections given
     to the houses situated on both sides of the disputed street have been given to us by
     MCD. The street is cleaned by the sweeper but I do not know where he throws the
     garbage. .......it is correct that Shahpur Jat is a urban village. ...‖.
     PW4 in his cross examination states, "I do not know whether the lay out plan of
     village Shahpur Jat has been approved by DDA/MCD. It is correct that the sever
     line has been laid, but I do not know who has laid the sever lanes in the disputed
     street. There are no electricity lanes in the dispute street. It is correct that the
     water lanes have been laid in half of the disputed street. No municipal sweeper
     comes to clean the disputed street. ..........our residential houses built in the
     dispute area sometime in 70's. No approval was taken from MCD before building
     the houses. Vol. said that we are paying property tax on these houses. .... It is the
     practice in village Shahpur Jat that no approval is obtained from the MCD before
     carrying out new construction of houses. It is also correct that we had created the
     disputed street in 70's without the approval of the MCD. It is correct that the
     houses built by us on both sides of the disputed street have been rented out to
     outsiders and as also occupied by us."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_8">     PW4 in his deferred cross examination states, "it is correct that the meter readers
     of electricity department used disputed street for visiting houses situated on both
     sides of disputed street. It is also correct that the postman also uses this street for
     delivery of letters to the residents situated on either sides of the disputed street.
     ......... it is correct that vegetable/ fruit vendors comes in the street for selling
     their products. Vol. we allow vendors only from whom we intend to purchase the
     vegetable or fruits etc. we have not deputed any chokidar/ watchman or any other
     person to restrict the entry in the disputed street.........."
     Thus, as per PW2, the street in question is cleaned by a sweeper but as per PW4
     no municipal sweeper comes in the street. Now, plaintiffs have nowhere stated
     that they had engaged a private sweeper to sweep the streets. More so in view of
     the fact that the area in question is an urbanized village and MCD is providing


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">RSA No. 78/2013 and RSA No. 94/2013                                              Page 5 of 20</span>
      various amenities in the area, it was for the plaintiffs to show that they are
     availing facilities of a private body for getting their streets cleaned.
     Then, it is seen that there is no guard employed by the plaintiffs to restrict the
     entry of the outsiders in the area. Even in private societies, security guards are
     employed to restrict general public. There is no such security or restriction
     provided to prevent access of general public to the street.
     Further there are no means of monitoring the entry of public persons into street
     and to regulate the same. Further plaintiffs have never averred that there is a
     public notice placed on the entrance of the street to warn the visitors that the
     street is not a thoroughfare and cannot be used as a public way. In the absence of
     such a notice, how can the plaintiffs maintain the sanctity of the street as private
     is inexplicable.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_9">     Further, there are water connections and electricity connections installed and
     maintained by public authorities.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_10">     Further, PW4 states that only those vegetable vendors are allowed from whom
     they want to buy vegetables. Now, plaintiffs have failed to state as to by what
     mechanism are they regulating the entrance of these vendors. That there any
     nominated vendors who alone are entitled to enter into the street has not been
     averred.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_11">     Thus, the plaintiffs have failed to aver the manner in which the nature of the street
     being private is maintained by them. There are no characteristics which would
     give the street a status of private street. Accordingly, the issue is decided against
     the plaintiff.‖


</blockquote><p id="p_7">6.            As regards issue no. 2, the trial court held that in view of Section

320 of the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, 1957 (DMC Act) the portion

DGHI was a ‗street' and thus the appellants/plaintiffs were wrongly putting a

wall immediately adjacent to the northern side wall of the house of the

respondents no.1 and 2/defendants for closing the ingress and egress of the

respondents no.1 and 2/defendants from their house to the private street/gali

DGHI including the disputed portion JKLM.                Issue no. 2 was accordingly

decided against the appellants/plaintiffs by observing as under:-




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">RSA No. 78/2013 and RSA No. 94/2013                                             Page 6 of 20</span>
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_12">      ―Issue no. 2
     Defendants have raised an objection with respect to Section 312 and 313 of Delhi
     Municipal Corporation Act as per which neither the private street nor the public
     street can be created without the sanction of MCD. Section 320 of DMC Act has
     also been relied upon by the defendants. Defendants submit that any existing
     street cannot be closed by putting a wall in the existing street or otherwise
     without approval of MCD. Thus, it is submitted that plaintiffs have no right to put
     any wall in the street or otherwise close it.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_13">     Section 320 of Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, 1957 states,
     "1) No person shall, except with the permission of the Commissioner granted in
     this behalf, erect or set up any wall, fence, rail, post.............whether fixed or
     movable or whether of a permanent or temporary nature, or any fixture in or
     upon any street ............"
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_14">     Thus, Section 320 of the Act clearly states that no wall can be erected on any
     street whether public or private without the permission of the Commissioner. The
     relief sought by the plaintiffs in the present case is that defendants be restrained
     from creating of any obstacle in the raising of the wall between the points K&amp; L
     in the alleged private street JKLM.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_15">     Thus, in view of Section 320 of the Act, the proper authority which can grant the
     permission for construction of wall is Commissioner, Municipal Corporation of
     Delhi and the relief cannot be granted by means of the present suit.
     Accordingly, the issue is decided in favour of the defendants.‖


</blockquote><p id="p_8">7.             When this appeal was admitted for hearing by an Order of a

learned Single Judge on 25.8.2014, the following substantial questions of law

were framed:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_16">     ―(i)      Whether the Trial Court without formulating an issue as to whether
     the street which was in issue declared as a public street within the definition of
     Section 316 of the MCD Act and holding whether the said street was a public
     street?
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_17">     (ii)      Whether the findings of the Trial Court and the first appellate Court
     are perverse?‖




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">RSA No. 78/2013 and RSA No. 94/2013                                            Page 7 of 20</span>
</blockquote><p id="p_9"> 8.           In exercise of my powers under <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_1">Section 100</a> (proviso) of CPC, the

following substantial questions of law are additionally framed:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_18">     ―(i)    Whether the courts below have ignored the ratio of the judgment of
     the Supreme Court in the case of Pt. Chet Ram Vashist (Dead) by LRs. Vs.
     Municipal Corporation of Delhi, (1995) 1 SCC 47 and which holds that a
     private street can be owned by the Corporation only if the land comprising a
     private street is acquired by the Government, and admittedly, there is no case
     set up by the respondents no.1 and 2/defendants of the suit land (being the
     private gali) having been acquired by the Government under the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_2">Land
     Acquisition Act</a>, 1894?
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_19">     (ii)    Whether the courts below have not committed gross illegality and
     perversity in holding that the street is a public street, although, no lay-out plan
     under Section 313 of the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, 1957 was filed and
     proved on record by the respondents no.1 and 2/defendants for showing that
     the street in question is shown as a public street in that lay-out plan, and which
     requirement of a lay-out plan under Section 313 of the DMC Act is a sine qua
     non before any private street can be said to be vested in the MCD for
     management and administration and which will also simultaneously have the
     effect of the owners of the private street not having any right in the same as
     normal individual owners?‖


</blockquote><p id="p_10">9.           In my opinion, all the aforesaid substantial questions of law are to

be answered in favour of the appellants/plaintiffs and against the respondents

no.1 and 2/defendants. The reasons for the same are given hereinafter.

</blockquote><p id="p_12">11.            Along with the aforesaid Sections of the DMC Act, certain

paragraphs of the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of Pt. Chet Ram

Vashist (Dead) by Lrs. (supra) would also be relevant and these paragraphs

read as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_48">      ―4.                                     xxxxx
           None of its provisions entitled the Corporation to claim any right or interest
      in the property of the owner. Sub-section (3) empowers the Standing Committee
      to accord sanction to the lay-out plan on such conditions as it may think fit. The
      expression, 'such conditions' has to be understood so as to advance the objective
      of the provision and the purpose for which it has been enacted. The Corporation
      has been given the right to examine that the lay-out plan is not contrary to any
      provision of the Act or the rules framed by it. For instance a person submitting a
      lay out plan may be required to leave certain open space or he may be required
      that the length and width of the rooms shall not be less than a particular
      measurement or that a coloniser shall have to provide amenities and facilities to
      those who shall purchase land or building in its colony. But the power cannot be
      construed to mean that the Corporation in the exercise of placing restrictions or
      imposing conditions before sanctioning a lay-out plan can also claim that it shall
      be sanctioned only if the owner surrenders a portion of the land and transfers it in
      favour of the Corporation free of cost. That would be contrary to the language
      used in the Section and violative of civil rights which vests in every owner to
      hold his land and transfer it in accordance with law. The resolution passed by the
      Corporation directing the appellant to transfer the space reserved for tube wells,
      school and park in its favour free of cost was depriving the owner of its property


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">RSA No. 78/2013 and RSA No. 94/2013                                               Page 12 of 20</span>
      and vesting it in the Corporation against law. The finding of the High Court that
     such condition did not amount to transfer of ownership but it was only a transfer
     of the right of management cannot be accepted. The two rights, namely, of
     ownership and of management, are distinct and different rights. Once a vacant
     site is transferred in favour of another free of cost then the person transferring it
     ceases to be owner of it. Whereas in transfer of right of management the
     ownership continues with the person to whom the property belongs and the local
     authority only gets rights to manage it. But the conditions imposed by the
     Standing Committee clearly meant to transfer the ownership in favour of the
     Corporation. The Corporation as custodian of civil amenities and services may
     claim and that would be proper as well, to permit the Corporation to regulate,
     manage, supervise and look after such amenities but whether such a provision can
     entitle a Corporation to claim that such property should be transferred to it free of
     cost appears to be fraught with insurmountable difficulties. The law does not
     appear to be in favour of the Corporation. Public purpose is, no doubt, a very
     important consideration and private interest has to be sacrificed for the welfare of
     the society. But when the appellant was willing to reserve the two plots for park
     and school then he was not acting against public interest. This cannot be stretched
     to create a right and title in favour of a local body which utmost may be entitled
     to manage and supervise only.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_49">     5. The power directing transfer of the land has been exercised Under
     <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_9">Section 313</a> of the Act. This Section falls in Chapter XV which deals with streets.
     The public streets are dealt from <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_10">Section 298</a> to <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_11">Section 311</a> whereas private
     streets are dealt from <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_12">Section 312</a> to Section 330 Section 312 obliges an owner of
     any land utilising, selling, leasing out or otherwise disposing of the land for the
     construction of building to lay-out and make a street or streets giving access to
     the plots into which the land may be divided and connect it with an existing or
     public street. <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_13">Section 313</a> requires such owner to submit a lay-out plan before
     utilising the land for any of the purposes mentioned in <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_14">Section 312</a> and send it to
     the Commissioner with a lay-out plan showing the particulars mentioned in
     clauses (a) to (e). The reservation or allotment of any site in the lay-out plan for
     any open space, park or school is to be provided by clause (b) of <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_15">Section 313</a>.
     <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_16">Section 316</a> entitles the Commissioner to declare a private street to be a public
     street on the request of owners. <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_17">Section 317</a> prohibits a person from constructing
     or projecting any structure which will encroach overhang project in a private
     street. In fact the entire cluster of Sections from 312 to 330 of which
     <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_18">Section 313</a> is a part, deals with private streets only. There is no provision in this
     chapter or any other provision in the Act which provides that any space reserved
     for any open space or park shall vest in the Corporation. Even a private street can
     be declared to be a public on the request of owners of the building and then only
     it vests in the Corporation. In absence of any provision, therefore, in the Act the
     open space left for school or park in a private colony cannot vest in the
     Corporation. That is why in England whenever a private colony is developed or a
     private person leaves an open space for park to be used for public purpose he is
     required to issue what is termed as 'Blight Notice' to the local body to get the land


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">RSA No. 78/2013 and RSA No. 94/2013                                           Page 13 of 20</span>
       transferred in its favour on payment of compensation. <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_19">Section 313</a> which
      empowers the Commissioner to sanction a lay-out plan, does not contemplate
      vesting of the land earmarked for a public purpose to vest in the Corporation or to
      be transferred to it. The requirement in law of requiring an owner to reserve any
      site for any street, open space, park, recreation ground, school, market or any
      other public purpose is not the same as to claim that the open space or park so
      earmarked shall vest in the Corporation or stand transferred to it. Even a plain
      reading of Sub-section (5) indicates that the land which is subject-matter of a lay-
      out plan cannot be dealt with by the owner except in conformity with the order of
      the Standing Committee. In other words the Section imposes a bar on exercise of
      power by the owner in respect of land covered by the lay-out plan. But it does not
      create any right or interest in the Corporation in the land so specified. The
      resolution of the Standing Committee, therefore, that the area specified in the lay-
      out plan for the park and school shall vest in the Corporation free of cost, was not
      in accordance with law.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_50">      6. Reserving any site for any street, open space, park, school etc. in a lay-out plan
      is normally a public purpose as it is inherent in such reservation that it shall be
      used by the public in general. The effect of such reservation is that the owner
      ceases to be a legal owner of the land in dispute and he holds the land for the
      benefit of the society or the public in general. It may result in creating an
      obligation in nature of trust and may preclude the owner from transferring or
      selling his interest in it. It may be true as held by the High Court that the interest
      which is left in the owner is a residuary interest which may be nothing more than
      a right to hold this land in trust for the specific purpose specified by the coloniser
      in the sanctioned lay-out plan. But the question is, does it entitle the Corporation
      to claim that the land so specified should be transferred to the authority free of
      cost. That is not made out from any provision in the Act or on any principle of
      law. The Corporation by virtue of the land specified as open space may get a right
      as a custodian of public interest to manage it in the interest of the society in
      general. But the right to manage as a local body is not the same thing as to claim
      transfer of the property to itself. The effect of transfer of the property is that the
      transferor ceases to be owner of it and the ownership stands transferred in the
      person in whose favour it is transferred. The resolution of the Committee to
      transfer land in the colony for parks and school was an order for transfer without
      there being any sanction for the same in law.‖                    (underlining added)


</blockquote><p id="p_13">12.            A reading of the aforesaid relevant Sections of the DMC Act read

with the ratio of the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of Pt. Chet Ram

Vashist (Dead) by Lrs. (supra) shows that when an undeveloped land is to be

made into a colony then a lay-out plan has to be got sanctioned under Section


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">RSA No. 78/2013 and RSA No. 94/2013                                             Page 14 of 20</span>
 313 of the DMC Act. It is only when a lay-out plan is sanctioned under Section

313 of the DMC Act would any street be vested for the purposes of

management and administration in the Municipal Corporation and the actual

owners would thereafter only be owners in trust having no rights to construct

and utilise the same as a private owner of a property. Thus, unless there is a

lay-out plan which is sanctioned under Section 313 of the DMC Act as a sine

qua non, it cannot be that a private street would become a public street.


</p><p id="p_14">13.          In the present case it is seen that no lay-out plan as sanctioned

under Section 313 of the DMC Act was filed on record and proved on behalf of

the respondents no.1 and 2/defendants whereby the private street/gali DGHI is

shown to have become a public street because of inclusion of this private street

in the lay-out plan as a public street. Once that is so, the private street/gali

DGHI cannot be said to have been vested in the Corporation even for the

purpose of management and administration because such management and

administration as per the ratio of Pt. Chet Ram Vashist (Dead) by Lrs.'s case

(supra) is only after sanction of a lay-out plan showing the street as a public

street/gali. I note that it is not the case of the respondents no.1 and 2/defendants

that they are claiming any ownership interest in the private street/gali DGHI and

that they only claim rights in the same on account of the said private street/gali

being a public street as the management and administration of the same is with



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">RSA No. 78/2013 and RSA No. 94/2013                                    Page 15 of 20</span>
 the MCD and in which it is said to have been built water lines, sewer lines, etc

of the MCD. Therefore once the respondents no.1 and 2/defendants have failed

to prove any lay-out plan showing a private gali as a public street forming part

of the lay-out plan, the subject private gali DGHI cannot be said to be a public

street unless the land in the gali was acquired by the Government under the

<a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_20">Land Acquisition Act</a> and as stated in the case of Pt. Chet Ram Vashist (Dead)

by Lrs. (supra). Admittedly, there is no case put forth by the respondents no.1

and 2/defendants that the street in question which is owned by the

appellants/plaintiffs was acquired by any public authority or the Union of India,

or by the MCD under the provisions of the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_21">Land Acquisition Act</a>. Thus on

these facts as found on record, the respondents no.1 and 2/defendants have no

right to use the private gali DGHI of which JKLM forms a part because neither

is this gali part of a lay-out plan under Section 313 of the DMC Act nor is the

same acquired by the Government or any public authority under the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_22">Land

Acquisition Act</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_15">
</p><p id="p_16">14.          The only other method for entitling any person to use a street as a

public street would be if the street is declared as a public street under Section

316 of the DMC Act. Under Section 316 of the DMC Act only if majority of

the owners of a private street ask the Commissioner of the MCD to declare the

private street as a public street would the private street/gali become a public



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">RSA No. 78/2013 and RSA No. 94/2013                                  Page 16 of 20</span>
 street. Admittedly, there is no case made out by the respondents no.1 and

2/defendants that Commissioner of the MCD in exercise of powers under

Section 316 of the DMC Act has declared the private gali DGHI as a public

street on account of the Commissioner of the MCD having been approached by

the majority of the co-owners of the private street. By the very language of

Section 316 of the DMC Act merely because a street is levelled or paved or that

there may exist water or sewer lines in the same, yet, such a private street

cannot become a public street in the absence of declaration by the

Commissioner under Section 316 of the DMC Act. Therefore, issue no. 1 has

been clearly and most illegally decided by the trial court against the

appellants/plaintiffs merely because the trial court has observed that there are

sewage lines and water lines in the street; a municipal sweeper cleans this street

and that there is no restriction on ingress and egress to this private street DGHI.

Ownership in a private street cannot be lost unless there is a declaration of the

Commissioner under Section 316 of the DMC Act. In this regard learned

Senior counsel for the appellants/plaintiffs has rightly placed reliance upon the

judgment of a learned Single Judge of this Court in the case of Kalo Mal Gopal

Chand Vs. Commissioner/Municipal Corporation of Delhi, 1966 (62) DLT

</p><p id="p_17">536. Accordingly, the findings on issue no. 1 by the courts below are clearly

illegal and perverse and are accordingly set aside and it is held that since there is



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">RSA No. 78/2013 and RSA No. 94/2013                                     Page 17 of 20</span>
 no declaration by the Commissioner under Section 316 of the DMC Act, the

private street DGHI including the portion JKLM cannot become a public street.


</p><p id="p_18">15.          Reliance placed by the courts below on Section 320 of the DMC

Act to hold the private street/subject gali as a street under this Section is

misplaced because <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_23">Section 320</a> follows the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_24">Sections 313</a> and <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_25">316</a> and therefore

the word ‗street' as found in <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_26">Section 320</a> is a public street and not a private

street. Therefore, restrictions imposed under Section 320 of the DMC Act are

for works upon a public street and not upon a private street, and as has been

wrongly held by the courts below. Obviously, it does not stand to reason also

that there can be any restriction on user of a private land owned by private

persons once there is no illegality in user of the private land by private persons.


</p><p id="p_19">16.          At this stage, I would note that the learned senior counsel for the

appellants/plaintiffs says that though the appellants/plaintiffs have complete and

absolute rights over the subject private street/gali, and therefore there is legal

disentitlement of the respondents no.1 and 2/defendants from opening any door

or windows or ventilators on their property which opens towards the gali DGHI

including the portion JKLM, yet, to the extent that any windows or ventilators

which have been already opened in the property of the respondents no.1 and

2/defendants towards the private gali DGHI including the portion JKLM, the

appellants/plaintiffs are not seeking to close the same without prejudice to their


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">RSA No. 78/2013 and RSA No. 94/2013                                    Page 18 of 20</span>
 rights, but it is also clarified that there is no entitlement of the respondents no.1

and 2/defendants either to open any door in their property opening towards the

gali DGHI of which the portion JKLM forms a part or for opening any further

windows or ventilators in their property which will open towards the private

gali DGHI of the appellants/defendants of which portion JKLM becomes a part.
