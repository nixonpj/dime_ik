                        =====================
                            INAP No.25 OF 2007
                        =====================

                   Dated this the 28th day of July 2008

                                 JUDGMENT
</pre>

<p id="p_1">       This appeal is preferred against the order of the             Employees'

Insurance Court, Palakkad in I.A.No.25 of 2003. The applicant therein has

challenged the decision of the Employees' State Insurance Corporation

contending that there is no manufacturing process with the aid of the power

on the shop and that the total number of employees is only 7 and therefore

the provisions of the E.S.I.Act are not attracted to the shop. The E.I.Court

found that the using of paint mixing machine to make different colours

amounts to manufacturing       as contemplated under the provisions of the

<a href="/doc/1955064/" id="a_1">Factories Act</a>. It further held that from the materials available, it can be seen

that necessary number of persons are there for attracting the application of

Section 2(12)(a) of the E.S.I Act. Learned counsel for the appellant very

strongly contends before me that a mixing machine is supplied by the

manufacturer and they are not manufacturing anything and therefore no

manufacturing process is carried and so the said Section will not be

attracted. On the other hand, the E.I.Court referred to <a href="/doc/527913/" id="a_2">Section 2(14AA)</a>,

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">INAP 25/2007                          -:2:-</span>

wherein by virtue of an amendment, it has been stated that the

manufacturing process shall have the meaning           assigned to it   in the

<a href="/doc/1955064/" id="a_3">Factories Act</a> of 1948. <a href="/doc/1691126/" id="a_4">Section 2(k)</a> of the Factories Act deals with

'manufacturing process'.     There the manufacturing process means         any

process for (i) making, altering, repairing, ornamenting, finishing, packing,

oiling, washing, cleaning, breaking up, demolishing, or otherwise treating or

adapting any article or substance with a view to its use sale, transport,

delivery or disposal. The E.I. Court held that it is an admitted fact that the

applicant is using paint mixing machine to make different colour paints

according to the requirements of the customers. By mixing the paintbase

with stainer an entirely different colour paint is produced. Therefore the said

mixing will amount to a process of altering, treating or adapting an article or

substance with a view to its sale which is nothing but a manufacturing

process as defined under Section 2(k)(i) of the Factors Act, 1948. I totally

agree with the said interpretation and the finding given by the E.I.Court.

Therefore it does not call for any interference.
</p>
<p id="p_2">      3. So far as the second question is concerned, it is a pure question of

fact that how many employees are there and there is nothing placed before

this Court to show that it was on account of a perverse or illegal approach.

Therefore that question will not amount to         the raising of a substantial

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">INAP 25/2007                        -:3:-</span>

question of law. Therefore it also cannot be entertained.

</p><p id="p_3">      From these discussions, there is     nothing to    interfere with the

decision rendered by the E.I.Court. Therefore the appeal fails and the same

is dismissed.
