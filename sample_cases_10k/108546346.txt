                          JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">Barkath Ali, J.
</p>
<p id="p_2">      Appellants are the claimants in O.P.(MV) No.149 of 1999

on the file of the Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal, Punalur.

They are parents, sister and brothers of Raju who died in a

motor accident. In this appeal they challenge the judgment and

award of the Tribunal dated November 12, 2001 awarding a

compensation of Rs.1,41,500/- for the loss caused to them on

account of the death of Raju in that accident.

</p><p id="p_3">      2. The accident occurred on December 30, 1994 at about

1.15 p.m. at North of Panayil Junction on the Kottayam

</p><p id="p_4">-Kottarakkara M.C. Road. While deceased Raju was standing

on the western side of the road, he was knocked down by a

mini lorry bearing registration No.KL-01/A/9291, driven by the

second respondent. He sustained serious injuries and he

succumbed to the injuries sustained while undergoing

treatment in the hospital. Alleging negligence against the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">MACA 865/2005                  2</span>

second respondent, the claimants filed the O.P. before the

Tribunal claiming compensation.
</p>
<p id="p_5">      3. This O.P. was tried along with O.P.(MV) No.160/99

filed by the legal heirs of another deceased person who died in

the same accident. Respondents 1 and 2, the owner and driver

of the offending mini lorry, remained absent and they were set

ex parte by the Tribunal. The third respondent, insurer of the

offending mini lorry, filed a written statement admitting the

policy but denied the liability. PWs.1 and 2 were examined and

Exts. A1 to A12 were marked on the side of the claimants. No

evidence was adduced by the contesting third respondent. The

Tribunal, on an appreciation of the evidence, found that the

accident occurred due to the negligence of the second

respondent and awarded a compensation of Rs.1,41,500/- with

interest @ 9% per annum          from the date of petition till

realization and cost of Rs.1,000/-. The claimants have come up

in appeal challenging the quantum of compensation awarded

by the Tribunal.
</p>
<p id="p_6">      4. Heard the counsel for the claimants and the counsel

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">MACA 865/2005                 3</span>

for the Insurance Company.
</p>
<p id="p_7">      5. The accident is not disputed.     The finding of the

Tribunal that the accident occurred due to the negligence of

the second respondent, driver of the offending vehicle, and

that the deceased died as a result of the injuries sustained in

the accident are not challenged in this appeal. Therefore, the

only question, which arises for consideration, is whether the

claimants are entitled to any enhanced compensation.

</p><p id="p_8">      6. The Tribunal awarded a total compensation of

Rs.1,41,500/- Break up of the compensation awarded is as

under:-
</p>
<pre id="pre_2">      Loss of dependency               :    Rs.1,10,000
      Loss of love and affection       :    Rs. 20,000
      Pain and suffering               :    Rs.      5,000
      Loss of estate                   :    Rs.      2,500
      Funeral expenses                 :    Rs.      2,000
      Ambulance charges                :    Rs.      2,000
                                            ------------------
          Total                        :    Rs.1,41,500
                                            ========

</pre><p id="p_9">      7. The counsel for the appellants sought enhancement of

compensation awarded by the Tribunal for the loss of

dependency and on other heads.
</p>
<p id="p_10"><span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">MACA 865/2005                 4</span>

</p><p id="p_11">      8. The Tribunal took the income of the deceased as

Rs.15,000/- per annum. After deducting 1/3rd for his personal

expenses, balance amount of Rs.10,000/- was taken as his

annual contribution to his family. The Tribunal adopted a

multiplier of 11 and awarded a compensation of Rs.1,10,000/-

for the loss of dependency. The deceased was aged 20 and he

was employed in an Aluminium Fabrication Company drawing

a salary of Rs.3,000/- per month, according to the claimants.

Taking into consideration the above aspect, we feel that the

monthly income of the deceased can reasonably be fixed at

Rs.2,500/-, which comes to Rs.30,000/- per annum. After

deducting 1/3rd for his personal expenses, balance amount of

Rs.20,000/- can be taken as his monthly contribution to his

family. Multiplier of 11 adopted by the Tribunal is not seriously

challenged. Thus, calculated for the loss of dependency, the

claimants are entitled to a compensation of Rs.2,20,000/- Thus,

the claimants     are entitled an additional compensation of

Rs.1,10,000/- on this count. As regards the compensation

awarded under other heads, we find the same to be reasonable

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">MACA 865/2005                  5</span>

and therefore,we are not disturbing the same. Regarding the

apportionment of the compensation amount and disbursement

of the same, the direction of the Tribunal will stand.

</p><p id="p_12">       9. In the result, the claimants are found entitled to

additional compensation of Rs.1,10,000/- with interest @ 9%

p.a. from the date of petition till realization and proportionate

costs. The third respondent being the insurer of the offending

vehicle shall deposit the amount within two months from the

date of receipt of a copy of this judgment with notice to the

claimants. The award of the Tribunal is modified to the above

extent.
</p>
<p id="p_13">       The appeal is disposed of as found above.
