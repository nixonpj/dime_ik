                       JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">     The present appeal has been preferred by the

appellant - KSRTC assailing the judgment and award

passed   by   the   Addl.   Senior   Civil   Judge,   MACT,

Srirangapatna (hereinafter referred to as 'the Tribunal'

for short) in MVC.No.236/2015 dated 12.04.2016.


</p><p id="p_2">     2. Though, this appeal is listed for admission, with

the consent of learned counsel appearing for the parties,

the same is taken up for final disposal.


</p><p id="p_3">     3. For the purpose of convenience, the parties are

referred to as per their ranking in the court below.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                             3</span>




</p><p id="p_4">      4. Brief facts of the case are that, on 21.4.2014 at

about 12.30 pm., the deceased A.Vishwanath was

proceeding on a Honda Active on Mysore-Bangalore

main road and when he came near Boomur Agrahara

Village,   a     KSRTC     bus     bearing    registration

No.KA-40-F-973 came in a rash and negligent manner

and dashed against the Honda Active. As a result of the

same, the said A.Vishwanath fell down and sustained

grievous injuries. Immediately, he       was shifted to

Srirangapatna General Hospital, Mysore and after first

aid, he was shifted to K.R. Hospital. But on the same

day, he succumbed to the injuries in the hospital.


</p><p id="p_5">      5. It is the contention of the petitioners that the

deceased   was    an   agriculturist   and   was   earning

Rs.10,000/- per month. The petitioners being the wife

and son of the deceased have filed a claim petition

claiming compensation under Section 166 of IMV Act.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                4</span>




</p><p id="p_6">     6. In response to the notice, respondent Nos.1 and

2   appeared    and    filed       their   written   statement.

Respondent Nos.3 and 4 did not appear and they were

placed exparte. Respondent Nos.1 and 2 denied the

averments made in the claim petition by contending

that the deceased was not an earning member and the

accident has not occurred with the KSRTC bus. It is

further contended that the deceased himself was riding

the motor bike in a rash and negligent manner and he

himself fell down and sustained injuries. It is further

contended that the rider of the motor bike was not

having valid and effective driving license to ride the

same as on the date of the accident. On these grounds,

they prayed for dismissal of the said petition.


</p><p id="p_7">     7. On the basis of the above pleadings, the

Tribunal has framed the following issues:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">     i.    Whether the petitioners proves, that on
           21.04.2014 at about 12.30 p.m., on
           Mysore-Bangalore    main   road,   near
           Boomur Agrahara Village, when deceased
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                             5</span>




            A.Vishwanath was proceed in a Honda
            Active at that movement the driver of
            KSRTC Bus bearing No.KA-40-F-973 has
            drive the same at high speed in a rash
            and negligent manner and dashed the
            Honda Active resulting into an accident
            and grievous injuries to deceased
            A.Vishwanath who succumbed to the
            injuries in the hospital?
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">     ii.    Whether the respondent proves that the
            accident has occurred due to contributory
            negligence     of      the     deceased
            A.Vishwanath?
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">     iii.   Whether the respondent proves that the
            petition is bad for non-joinder of owner
            and insurer of Active Honda?
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">     iv.    Whether the petitioners are entitled for
            compensation? If so, how much and from
            whom?
</blockquote>
     v.     What order or award?<p id="p_8">


</p><p id="p_9">     8. In order to substantiate their case, 1st petitioner

was examined as PW.1, examined one more witness as

P.W.2 and got marked the documents as Exs.P.1 to P.24

and on behalf of the respondents, the driver of the

KSRTC bus was examined as R.W.1 and got marked the

documents as Ex.R1 and R.2.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                             6</span><p id="p_10">




</p><p id="p_11">     9. After hearing the parties to the lis, the

impugned judgment and award came to be passed by

the Tribunal. The main ground urged by the learned

counsel appearing for the appellant is that the deceased

was aged about 74 years and he was not an earning

member. The Tribunal by taking the notional income at

the rate of Rs.6,500/- and by deducting 1/3rd instead of

50%, has awarded the compensation on the higher side.

She further contended that though the medical bills

have not been produced, the Tribunal has awarded a

sum of Rs.1,28,547/-, which is not correct. She further

contended   that   the   compensation    awarded    under

conventional heads is also on the higher side. On these

grounds, she prayed for allowing the appeal by reducing

the compensation awarded by the Tribunal.


</p><p id="p_12">     10. Per contra, learned counsel appearing for the

respondents/claimants       vehemently     argued      by

contending that the deceased was aged about 74 years
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                7</span>




as on the date of the accident. The Tribunal by taking

the age of the deceased as 70 years and by taking the

notional income at the rate of Rs.6,500/- and after

deducting 1/3rd towards the personal expenses has

rightly   awarded    the   compensation.    He   further

contended that the records clearly indicate the fact that

an amount of Rs.1,28,547/- has been spent towards the

medical expenses and the same has been rightly

awarded by the Tribunal. On these grounds, he prayed

for dismissal of the appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_13">
</p><p id="p_14">      11. As could be seen from the judgment and

award passed by the Tribunal, it is the contention of the

petitioners that the deceased was doing agriculture and

was earning of Rs.10,000/- per month. In order to

substantiate the said fact, they have not produced any

document. In the absence of said document, the

Tribunal by taking the notional income at the rate of

Rs.6,500/- and after deducting 1/3rd towards the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                             8</span>




personal expenses of the deceased and after applying

the multiplier of 5 has awarded compensation of

Rs.2,59,980/-. Though, the method adopted by the

Tribunal appears to be justifiable, admittedly, the

accident is of the year 2014 and at that time, the

notional income at Rs.8,500/- is adopted for the

purpose of settlement of case before the lokadalath.


</p><p id="p_15">     12. If the income is taken at the rate of Rs.8,500/-

per month and as could be seen from the averments

made in the petition, the 2nd respondent being the son

of the deceased who is major and not depending on

anyone, under such circumstance, the Tribunal ought

to have deducted 50% towards the personal expenses.

After deducting 50% towards the personal expenses and

after applying the multiplier of 5 as the deceased was

more than 70 years, under such circumstance, the

claimants are entitled to a sum of Rs.2,55,000/-

towards loss of dependency. As could be seen from the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                             9</span>




judgment and award passed by the Tribunal, an

amount of Rs.2,75,000/- has been awarded under

conventional heads, but in view of the decision of the

Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of National Insurance

Company Limited Vs. Pranay Sethi and others

reported    in    AIR     2017         SC   5157,       the

respondents/claimants are entitled to an amount of

Rs.70,000/- under conventional heads.


</p><p id="p_16">     13. Even as could be seen from the records, the

petitioners have produced Ex.P.9 - inpatient bill, the

said inpatient bill is to the tune of Rs.1,28,547/- and

under such circumstance, the compensation awarded

under the head medical expenses appears to be just and

proper.
</p>
<p id="p_17">
</p><p id="p_18">     14.   Keeping   in   view   the    above   facts   and

circumstances, the respondents/claimants are entitled

to a sum of Rs.4,53,547/- as against Rs.6,63,527/-
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                             10</span>




awarded by the Tribunal with 6% interest per annum.

Accordingly, I proceed to pass the following

                            ORDER

</p><p id="p_19">     i)    The appeal is partly allowed.</p>
<p id="p_20">
</p><p id="p_21">     ii)   The impugned judgment and award
           passed   by   the     Tribunal   in    MVC
           No.236/2015     dated     12.04.2016     is
           modified as indicated above.
</p>
<p id="p_22">     The amount in deposit may be transmitted to the

jurisdictional Tribunal and the remaining amount has

to be deposited within a period of six weeks from the

date of receipt of certified copy of this order. The

disbursement of compensation will be in terms of the

award.
