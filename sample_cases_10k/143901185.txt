 IN THE HIGH COURT OF JUDICATURE FOR RAJASTHAN AT JAIPUR BENCH, JAIPUR

S.B. Civil Writ Petition No.13428/2009
(Mahaveer Singh &amp; Ors. Vs. State of Rajasthan &amp; Ors.)


Date of Order :: 19th April, 2012


HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE M.N. BHANDARI

Mr.Manoj Pareek, for the petitioners.
Mr.G.N.Mishra Manav, Addl.G.C.

By the Court:</pre>
<p id="p_1">		In this writ petition, two fold prayers have been made. One is regarding grant of selection scale by counting length of service since 01.09.1972 and other is regarding benefit of leave encashment.
</p>
<p id="p_2">		It is stated that vide orders passed on different dates, petitioners were taken in regular establishment.  According to learned counsel for petitioners, the issue regarding selection of work charge employees has already been set at rest by the Division Bench of this Court in the case of State of Rajasthan &amp; Ors. Vs. Prem Devi &amp; Anr. in DB Civil Special Appeal (W) No.1226/2009 along with 8 other special appeals decided on 22nd February, 2011. Therein, the benefit of selection scale is directed to be given from the date an employee is taken in the regular establishment and not from the date one acquired permanent status in the work charge establishment. It is prayed that direction given by the Division Bench may be applied in the present matter for the purpose of grant of selection scale so as the benefit of leave encashment by taking length of service from the date petitioners were taken in regular establishment.
</p>
<p id="p_3">		Learned counsel for respondents submits that if a direction is given in the light of the judgment of Division Bench, they have no objection but the benefit of selection scale should be by counting length of service from the date petitioners were taken in regular establishment and not from the date they acquired permanent status. It should not be allowed for those retired prior to Circular dated 04.03.1998

		In view of submissions made by learned counsel and keeping in mind the judgment of Division Bench in the case of Prem Devi &amp; Anr. (supra), present writ petition needs to be considered. 
</p>
<p id="p_4">		The direction of Division Bench gets relevance, thus para No.9 of said judgment is quoted hereunder for ready reference:
</p><p id="p_5">9.In the instant case, we modify the direction of the Single Bench to the extent that the benefit shall be extended to the respondents from the date mentioned by us in the order and their service has to be counted from the date they were taken in regular establishment and not from the date they acquired permanent status in the work charge establishment. It is made clear that the respondents-employees were regular employees with effect from the date they were taken in regular establishment, let benefit be accordingly extended to them. We direct that compliance of this order be made within three months.
</p>
		
<p id="p_6">		Perusal of direction quoted above reveals that one is entitled to count his length of service from the date, he is taken in regular establishment and not from the date they acquired permanent status. Accordingly, so far as first prayer is concerned, respondents are directed to consider the case of petitioner for grant of benefit of selection scale from the date petitioner was taken in regular establishment but it should be then as per Circular dated 04.03.1998.
</p>
<p id="p_7">		So far as second issue regarding leave encashment is concerned, again the period of leave should be taken into consideration from the date petitioner was taken in regular establishment. If any leave encashment is found due pursuant to direction aforesaid, required exercise may be undertaken by the respondents with the extension of benefit of remaining leave encashment if it does not exceed to maximum limit. 
</p>
<p id="p_8">		With the aforesaid, the writ petition stands disposed off. 
</p><p id="p_9">(M.N. BHANDARI), J.
