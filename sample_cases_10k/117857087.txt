BRIEF REASONS FOR THE DECISION:

</pre><p id="p_1">1.    In brief, case of the prosecution against accused Sonu is that on 29.03.2007 at about

08:10 PM, at MCD Work Shop, Delhi, within the jurisdiction of PS Nabi Karim, accused

was found in possession of one button actuated knife, Ex. P-1 having total length 24 cm

long with blade of 11 cm in length and width 2.5 cm in contravention of notification

issued under <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_4">Arms Act</a>. As such, as per prosecution, accused committed an offence

punishable u/s 25 <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_5">Arms Act</a>. On the basis of rukka sent by HC Udaivir Singh, formal

FIR, Ex. PW-1/A was registered for offence u/s 25 of <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_6">Arms Act</a>. The case was

investigated into. The investigation ended in the filing of the charge-sheet u/s 173 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_7">Cr.P.C</a>.


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                                                                Page 1 of 8</span>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                               2</span>
</p><p id="p_2">                                                                                FIR No. 127/<a href="/doc/105870808/" id="a_8">07
                                                                                 State vs. Sonu</a>

charging the accused with the commission of an offence punishable u/s 25 of <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_9">Arms Act</a>.

</p><p id="p_3">2.    Vide order dated, 13.08.2008, accused was charged for offence u/s 25 of <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_10">Arms Act</a>

to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed trial.
</p>
<p id="p_4">3.    To substantiate its case on judicial file, prosecution has examined as many as three

witnesses. PW-1 is HC Mool Chand, who being duty officer proved carbon copy of FIR,

Ex. PW-1/A. PW-2 is Ct. Karnail Singh who was on patrolling duty along with HC

Udaivir Singh and is a recovery witness. PW-3 is HC Ratan Chand, who is 2nd IO of the

case. Vide order dated, 28.04.2010, PE was closed and on 29.04.2010 statement of

accused was recorded u/s 281/313 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_11">Cr.P.C</a>. wherein accused denied the case of

prosecution in toto. However, accused did not intend to lead DE.

</p><p id="p_5">4.    I have heard Ld. APP for the State and the accused and gone through case file very

carefully.
</p>
<p id="p_6">5.    It is submitted by Ld. APP for the State that by virtue of evidence available on

judicial file, accused is liable to be convicted for the offence punishable u/s 25 of <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_12">Arms

Act</a>. On the other hand, accused submits that he has been falsely implicated in the present

case and he is totally innocent.
</p>
<p id="p_7">6.    I have gone through the material on judicial file very carefully.

</p><p id="p_8">7.   It is settled proposition of criminal law that prosecution is supposed to prove its

case on judicial file beyond reasonable doubts by leading reliable, cogent and convincing

evidence. Further, it is a settled proposition of criminal law that in order to prove its case

on judicial file, prosecution is supposed to stand on its own legs and it cannot derive any

benefit whatsoever from the weaknesses, if any, in the defence of the accused. Further, it

is a settled proposition of criminal law that burden of proof of the version of the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                               3</span>

                                                                                 State vs. Sonu</a>

prosecution in a criminal trial throughout the trial is on the prosecution and it never shifts

to the accused. Also it is a settled proposition of criminal law that the accused is entitled

to the benefit of every reasonable doubt in the prosecution story and such doubt entitles

the accused to acquittal.
</p>
<p id="p_9">8.    In my opinion, as a cumulative effect of following reasons the accused is entitled to

be acquitted of the charge against him:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">           (a) Chapter 22 Rule 49 of Punjab Police Rules, 1934, provides as under:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">                  22.49.      Matters to be entered in Register No.II- The
                  following matters shall, amongst others, be entered:-
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">                  (c)           The hour of arrival and departure on duty at or
                  from a police station of all enrolled police officers of
                  whatever rank, whether posted at the police station or
                  elsewhere, with a statement of the nature of their duty. This
                  entry shall be made immediately on arrival or prior to the
                  departure of the officer concerned and shall be attested by
                  the latter personally by signature or seal.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_10">             Note:- The term Police Station will include all places such as Police Lines

and Police Posts where Register No.II is maintained.
</p>
<p id="p_11">             In the present case, the above said provision appears to have not been

complied with by prosecution. As per the prosecution version at the time of the

apprehension of the accused with Knife, Ex. P-1 in his possession HC Udaivir Singh and

Ct. Karnail Singh were on area patrolling duty near police post, Nabi Karim, at about

08:00 PM, but the DD entry vide which HC Udaivir Singh and Ct. Karnail Singh had left

the PS for patrolling has not been brought on record. Even the number of the said DD

entries made in Register No. II has not been brought on judicial record. In my opinion

prosecution was under an obligation to prove on record, the above said DD entries vide



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                                                                  Page 3 of 8</span>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                              4</span>
                                                                              FIR No. 127/<a href="/doc/105870808/" id="a_14">07
                                                                               State vs. Sonu</a>

which HC Udaivir Singh and Ct. Karnail Singh had left the PS for patrolling duty so as to

prove the possibility of availability of HC Udaivir Singh and Ct. Karnail Singh at the

place of apprehension of the accused. At this juncture, it would be relevant to refer to a

case law reported as Rattan Lal V/s State, 1987(2) Crimes 29 wherein the Hon'ble

Delhi High Court has been observed that if the investigating agency deliberately ignores

to comply with the provisions of the Act, the courts will have to approach their action

with reservations. The matter has to be viewed with suspicion if the provisions of law are

not strictly complied with and the least that can be said is that it is so done with an

oblique motive. This failure to bring on record, the DD entries creates a reasonable doubt

in the prosecution version and attributes oblique motive on the part of the prosecution.

</p><p id="p_12">9.           In the present case, after the apprehension of accused at about 08:10 PM,

but before searching his body no attempts whatsoever were made by HC Udaivir Singh to

ensure that search of accused by him is witnessed by independent public witnesses who

were very much available at the place of apprehension of accused as per the contents of

rukka only. After the apprehension of accused, HC Udaivir Singh could very well have

served the passersby with notice in writing requiring them to join the police proceedings

or to face legal action u/s 187 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_15">IPC</a> in as much as by that point of time, accused stood

already apprehended and there were no chances of crime going undetected or accused

escaping the arrest. Also even the identify of the passersby who were requested to join

the police proceedings has not been recorded by IO on the rukka. In such circumstances it

cannot be said that on account of reasonable excuses only, passer bys had, if it was so,

refused to join police proceedings. This failure on the part of prosecution creates

reasonable doubt in the prosecution story. It this regard, reliance may be placed on the

following case laws:
</p>
<p id="p_13">In a case law reported as Anoop Joshi V/s State 1999(2) C.C. Cases 314 (HC), Hon'ble
High Court of Delhi has observed as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_4">            "18. It is repeatedly laid down by this court that in such cases
            it should be shown by the police that sincere efforts have been
            made to join independent witnesses. In the present case, it is
            evident that no such sincere efforts have been made,
            particularly when we find that shops were open and one or two
            shop-keepers could have been persuaded to join the raiding
            party to witness the recovery being made from the appellant.
            In case any of the shop-keepers had declined to join the raiding
            party, the police could have later on taken legal action against
            such shop-keepers because they could not have escaped the
            rigours of law while declining to perform their legal duty to
            assist the police in investigation as a citizen, which is an
            offence under the <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_17">IPC</a>".
</blockquote><p id="p_14">In a case law reported as Roop Chand V/s The State of Haryana 1999 (1) C.L.R. 69,
the Hon'ble Punjab &amp; Haryana High Court held as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_5">            "3.           I have heard the learned counsel for the parties
            and gone through the evidence with their help. The recovery
            of illicit liquor was effected from the possession of the
            petitioner during noon time and it is in the evidence of the
            prosecution witnesses that some witnesses from the public
            were available and they were asked to join the investigation.
            The explanation furnished by the prosecution is that the
            independent witnesses were asked to join the investigation but
            they refused to do so on the ground that their joining will
            result into enmity between them and the petitioner".
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">            "4. It is well settled principle of the law that the investigating
            Agency should join independent witnesses at the time of
            recovery of contraband articles, if       they are available and
            their failure to do so in such a situation casts a shadow of doubt
            on the prosecution case. In the present case also admittedly the
            independent witnesses were available at the time of recovery
            but they refused to associate themselves in the investigation.
            This explanation does not inspire confidence because the
            police officials who are the only witnesses examined in the
            case have not given the names and addresses of the persons
            contacted to join. It is a very common excuse that the

            police officer conducting investigation of a crime is entitled to
            ask anybody to join the investigation and on refusal by a
            person from the public the investigating Officer can take action
            against such a person under the law. Had it been a fact that the
            witnesses from the public had refused to join the investigation,
            the Investigating Officer must have proceeded against them
            under the relevant provisions of law. The failure to do so by
            the police officer is suggestive of the fact that the explanation
            for non-joining the witnesses from the public is an after
            thought and is not worthy of credence. All these facts taken
            together make the prosecution case highly doubtful".</blockquote><p id="p_15">

Hon'ble Punjab &amp; Haryana High Court observed as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_7">            "5. In a criminal trial, it is for the prosecution to establish its
            case beyond all reasonable doubts. It is for the prosecution to
            travel the entire distance from may have to must have. If the
            prosecution appears to be improbable or lacks credibility, the
            benefit of doubt necessarily has to go to the accused".
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_8">            "6. In the present case, the State examined two witnesses
            namely, Harbans Singh ASI who appeared as PW1 and Kartar
            Singh PW2. Both the witnesses supported the prosecution
            version in terms of the recovery of opium from the person of
            the petitioner, but there was no public witness who had joined.
            It is not necessary in such recoveries that public witnesses must
            be joined, but attempt must be made to join the public
            witnesses. There can be cases when public witnesses are
            reluctant to join or are not available. All the same, the
            prosecution must show a genuine attempt having been made to
            join a public witness or that they were not available. A stereo-
            type statement of non-availability will not be sufficient
            particularly when at the relevant time, it was not difficult to
            procure the service of public witness. This reflects adversely on
            the prosecution version".

the date and time when the seal was returned to PW HC Udaivir Singh by PW Ct. Karnail

<p id="p_18">11.   In the present case, before taking the formal/ casual search of the accused after his

apprehension police official (s) had made no efforts to ensure that search of the accused

by him them is witnessed by independent public witnesses.

the accused before taking the search of the accused. At this juncture, it would be

appropriate to refer to the judgment of Hon'ble Orissa High Court reported as

Rabindernath Prusty Vs. State of Orissa, wherein it was held as under:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_9">            "10. The next part of the prosecution case is relating to the
            search and recovery of Rs. 500/- from the accused. One of the
            formalities that has to be observed in searching a person in that
            the searching Officer and other assisting him should give their
            personal search to the accused before searching the person of
            the accused. (See AIR 1969 SC 53 : (1969 Cri L.J. 279), State
            of Bihar V/s Kapil Singh). This rule is meant to avoid the
            possibility of implanting the object which was brought out by
            the search. There is no evidence on record whatsoever that the
            raiding party gave their personal search to the accused before
            the latter's person was searched. Besides the above, it is in the
            evidence of PWs 2 and 5 that the accused wanted to know the
            reason for which his person was to be searched and the reason
            for such search was not intimated to the accused. No
            independent witness had witnessed the search. In the above
            premises, my conclusion is that the search was illegal and
            consequently the conviction based thereon is also vitiated".</blockquote><p id="p_20">
</p><p id="p_21">      Being guided by above said case law, it can be said that search of the accused by
above said police officials was in complete violation of the above said case law and the
same can be said to be illegal.
