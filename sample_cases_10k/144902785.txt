     Ld. Counsel for petitioner has submitted that the property which
     was acquired in this matter was a residence cum shop situated in
     Bhagwati Garden Colony, KK Commercial Complex, Uttam
     Nagar. The property was purchased by the petitioner on 17.9.96.</blockquote>
<p id="p_11">     At the time of assessing the compensation of the property, the
     Land Acquisition Collector has not considered the entire aspects,
     facts and circumstances. The property was considered as

   agricultural land for the purpose of assessing the compensation,
   whereas, the property was a residence cum shop where the
   petitioner was residing and running commercial activities. The
   petitioner was enjoying the water, electricity, telephone
   connection etc. installed by concerned Government departments.
   It was surrounded by well developed colonies. It has been further
   submitted that during the said relevant period two shops were sold
   by the DDA vide sale deed Ex.PW1/1 and PW1/2 situated in the
   same vicinity just across the road at much higher price i.e. for a
   sum of Rs. 1.92 crore and for Rs. 2.35 crores. Further, in order
   to substantiate this contention qua the higher prices of the land in
   the same vicinity at relevant period, the petitioner has examined
   PW2 Smt. Sushila who had purchased one shop of 80 sq. yards @
   Rs. 6.60 lac and proved the sale deed as Ex. PW2/A. It has been
   further submitted that PW4 Rameshwar Dass approved valuer has
   assessed the value of the property @ Rs. 20,000/- per sq. yards
   and cost of construction @ Rs. 500/- per sq. feet. By relying upon
   all these documents and submissions it was submitted that the
   plaintiff has succeeded in bringing on record sufficient material
   that on the day when the notification U/s 4 of <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_7">Land Acquisition
   Act</a> was issued the price of the property was at much higher rates.
   Prayer has been made to grant enhanced            compensation of
   acquired land to the petitioner.

   DDA have submitted to the effect that the property was rightly
   assessed for the purpose of payment of compensation.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">LAC no.  33/10/08                                              Page 5 of 12</span>

<p id="p_13">8.     I have heard the arguments of ld. Counsel for both parties
     besides going through the material available on record carefully.
</p><p id="p_14">                One of the main grievance of the Ld. Counsel for
     petitioner is that despite the fact that the petitioner was running
     shop / commercial activity from the property in question where
     the concerned authorities have provided electricity, water and
     telephone connection etc. since long, Land Acquisition Collector
     has considered the property as agricultural land and paid less
     compensation.
</p><p id="p_15">                On this score, before proceedings ahead for ready
     reference the relevant portion of <a href="/doc/1485112/" id="a_8">Section 24</a> of Land Acquisition
     Act is reproduced which is as under :-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_8">           24. Matters to be neglected in determining
           compensation.- But the Court shall not take into
           consideration--

           eighthly,      any increase to the value of the land

           forbidden by law or opposed to public policy.

<p id="p_16">9.              In this matter, the petitioner at any stretch of time has not
     claimed that the superstructure existing at the spot at the time of
     acquisition was in accordance with building bye laws or approved

   sanctioned plan from the concerned authorities. It transpires that
   the construction over the property in question was illegal and
   unauthorized.
</p><p id="p_17">                    By plain reading of <a href="/doc/1485112/" id="a_9">Section 24</a> of Land Acquisition Act,
   it reveals that the Court can ignore any increased value of the land
   if the same is put to use in case it is forbidden by law. Therefore,
   raising any construction over the agricultural land and using the
   premises for commercial activity was unauthorized act of the
   petitioner. Reliance can be made in case <a href="/doc/597893/" id="a_10">State of Orissa vs.
   Rajkishore Dass</a>, 1996 (4) SCC 221, Hon'ble Supreme Court has
   inter alia, hold as under:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_11">                    The construction was unauthorized...........
                    Therefore, the authorities are not bound by
                    such construction. Consequently, the State is
                    not bound to pay compensation of the value
                    of    such     a    building     constructed
                    unauthorizedly.</blockquote>
<p id="p_18">                Hence, under these circumstances, the petitioner cannot
   be awarded compensation at commercial rates on the basis of the
   fact that the petitioner was running commercial activities from
   agricultural land.
</p><p id="p_19">                In case any electricity or telephone connection were
   installed in the premises by concerned authorities it does not
   make the act of the petitioner legal as the said authorities have no
   power to allow the change of the user of land.

<p id="p_20">10.             Ld. Counsel for petitioner has also stressed on the score

   that the DDA has sold two shops at much higher price vide sale
   deed Ex. PW1/2 and Ex. PW1/3 on 7.10.02 i.e. during the
   relevant period when the notification U/s 4 of <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_11">Land Acquisition
   Act</a> was issued in this matter.
</p><p id="p_21">                On this score it has been contented by Ld. Counsel for
   respondent that both these shops were sold by the DDA in open
   public auction. In the open public auction the highest bid is
   accepted as the auction in open public always goes on higher side.
   It has been further submitted that the DDA auctioned the shop
   only after developing the area. The reliance was made in case
   <a href="/doc/519110/" id="a_12">Lalchand vs. Union of India</a> &amp; anr., VII 2009 SLT 439,
   wherein, Hon'ble Supreme Court has held as under :-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_12">                             Compensation-DDA brochure giving
                    provisional rates for allotment of plot on lease
                    hold basis, not relevant evidence. Such
                    allotment rates of plots adopted by
                    Development Authorities like DDA cannot form
                    basis for award of compensation for acquisition
                    of undeveloped lands, for several reasons.
                    Firstly, market value has to be determined with
                    reference to large tracts of undeveloped
                    agricultural lands in rural area, whereas
                    allotment rates of development authorities are
                    with reference to small plots developed layout
                    falling within Urbana. Secondly, DDA and
                    other statutory authorities adopt different rates
                    for plot in same area with reference to
                    economic capacity of buyer, making it difficult
                    to ascertain real market value, whereas market
                    value determination for acquisition is uniform

                    market value of freehold land, whereas
                    allotment "rates" in DDA brochure refer to
                    initial premium payable on allotment of plots
                    on lease hold basis. Factors elaborated by this
                    Court.</blockquote>
<p id="p_22">                In the light of above judgment it is found that sale of any
   property in the area developed by DDA cannot be considered at
   par with the construction raised over the agricultural land
   unauthorizedly for granting compensation. This aspect also does
   not help the petitioner.

<p id="p_23">11.             In regard to the sale deed Ex. PW2/A brought on record
   during the evidence of smt. Sushila. It is found that in the present
   matter vide award in question 4341.90 sq. meter property was
   acquired, whereas PW2 Smt. Sushila vide sale deed Ex. PW2/A
   has purchased only 80 sq. yards. Proportionately the property
   purchased by PW2 is of very meager area comparing to the
   property acquired in the matter. The compensation cannot be
   assessed on the basis of the sale transaction of a very small area.
   The reliance can be made in case Collector of Lakhimpur vs.
   Buddhan chandra Dutta, wherein, it was held as under :-
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_13">                              "In determining compensation, the
                     value fetched for small plot of land cannot
                     be applied to lands covering a very large
                     extent. The large area of land cannot
                     possibly fetch a price at the same rate at
                     which small plots are sold."

<p id="p_24">12.             Regarding the property assessed by Government
   approved valuer as came in the evidence of PW4 Rameshwar
   Dass, it is found that he has assessed the value @ Rs. 20,000/- per
   sq. yards. But no reliance can be made on the valuation of the
   property assessed by the valuer because the notice of the visit of
   the valuer was not issued to the respondent before inspecting the
   property. The exparte report was furnished by the valuer. In case
   Kaladevi vs. state of Haryana, 1996 Punjab Law Reporter 471, it
   was, inter alia, held as under :-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_14">               I am of the view that in this regard, no
               enhancement is called for. The report is an ex-
               parte one and no notice was given to the
               department when the expert inspected the site
               and determined the market value of the wells
               and structure.

<p id="p_25">13.             On the score of change and shifting of business, it is
   found that the petitioner has not brought on record any statement
   of account/sale transaction etc. of his earlier business, if any
   running from the acquired property nor the petitioner has brought
   on record any material to show that he has shifted its business to
   somewhere else. The details of expenditure incurred by him, if
   any, while shifting his business were not furnished. Therefore,
   the contention of Ld. Counsel for petitioner on this score is also
   without any force. In the light of above discussion it is found that
   the petitioner has failed to bring on record any cogent material
   that on the day when notification U/s 4 of <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_13">Land Acquisition Act</a>


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">LAC no.  33/10/08                                              Page 10 of 12</span>

   was made, the value of the property was on the higher side to that
   of the value assessed by the Land Acquisition Collector and that
   the petitioner is entitled for any such enhancement of value.
   Accordingly, both these issues stands decided against the
   petitioner and in favor of the respondents.

   maintainable being time barred? OPR
                On this score it is found that the award was made by the
   Addl. District Magistrate/ LAC (West) on 10.11.05. Whereas the
   present reference was made on 18.7.06. In view of provisions of
   <a href="/doc/948147/" id="a_14">Section 12</a> Land Acquisition Act the reference can be made to the
   Collector within six weeks from the date of Collector's award if
   the award is passed in the presence of party or within six weeks
   from the receipt of notice in case no person was present over there
   or within six months from the date of collectors award whichever
   is earlier.
</p><p id="p_27">                In the present case the award in question dt. 10.11.05
   reveals that in response to the notice issued U/s 9(1) and 10(1) of
   <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_15">Land Acquisition Act</a> the petitioner alongwith other effected
   persons have filed objections. Even oral as well as documentary
   evidence was lead before Land Acquisition Collector which was
   dealt with at the time of passing of award. It transpires that the
   petitioner was having knowledge of pendency of proceeding
   before LAC and it could be safely presumed that the petitioner
   was having knowledge of passing of award on the day when it

   was passed. Under these circumstances the contentions of the
   petitioner that no notice of passing of award was received or that
   the petitioner came to know about passing of award on 22.4.06
   i.e. on day when the petitioner went to office of LAC to enquire
   about the award is found to be after thought and without any
   merit. The entire circumstances reveals that the reference was
   made after the period of limitation of six weeks after the passing
   of award.        In case <a href="/doc/157214/" id="a_16">Mohammed Hasnuddin vs. The State of
