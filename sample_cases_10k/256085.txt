 IN THE HIGH COURT OF JUDICATURE AT MADRAS

DATED: 19/07/2004

CORAM

THE HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE V. KANAGARAJ
and
THE HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE S. ASHOK KUMAR

Habeas Corpus Petition No.320 of 2004


J.Mahalingam                           ..              Petitioner

-Vs-

1. State, rep. by its
   Secretary to Government,
   Prohibition &amp; Excise
   Department,
   For St. George,
   Chennai - 9.

2. The District Magistrate,
    and District Collector,
   Nagapattinam District.               ..              Respondents

        Petition filed under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India  praying
for the relief as stated therein.

For petitioner :  No appearance

For respondents :  Mr.  Abudu Kumar Rajarathinam
        Government Advocate (Crl.  side)

:O R D E R
</pre>
<p id="p_1">(Order of the Court was delivered by V.  KANAGARAJ,J.)

                The brother  of  the  detenu is the petitioner herein.  He has
come forward to file the above petition praying to  issue  a  Writ  of  Habeas
Corpus,  calling  for  the  records relating to the order in COC.13/2004 dated
26.2.2004 passed by the second respondent herein, quash the  same  as  illegal
and further  direct  the  respondents  to  produce  the  detenu J.  Ravi, S/o.
Jeganathan,  TPDA  No.4144,  who  is  now  confined  in  the  Central  Prison,
Trichirappalli, before this Court and set him at liberty forthwith.
</p>
<p id="p_2">                2.   The  detenu has been detained on the ground that he was a
Bootlegger, under the relevant provisions of <a href="/doc/195458/" id="a_2">Tamil Nadu Act</a> 14 of 1982.
</p>
<p id="p_3">                3.  Heard Mr.  Abudu Kumar  Rajarathinam,  learned  government
advocate  on  the criminal side with no representation made on the part of the
petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_4">                4.  On a perusal of the records, it comes to be noted by  this
Court that in the ground case against the detenu in Mayiladuthurai Prohibition
Enforcement   Wing  Crime  No.309/2004  has  been  registered  under  <a href="/doc/1727018/" id="a_3">Sections
4(1)(aaa)</a> r/w.4(1-A) of the TNP Act 1937, wherein in the remand order,  it  is
noted by the learned Magistrate that the accused was produced and no complaint
of  ill-treatment;  'no  prima  facie  case  under  <a href="/doc/1312751/" id="a_4">Section 4</a>(1-A) TNP Act and
therefore, remanded only under <a href="/doc/1312751/" id="a_5">Section 4</a>(1 )(aaa)  TNP  Act  till  27.2.2004',
thereby  making  it  very  clear that in spite of no case having been made out
against the detenu under <a href="/doc/1312751/" id="a_6">Section 4</a>(1-A) TNP Act in the said case at  the  time
of  remand,  still,  on  account  of  non-application  of  mind, the detaining
authority, has stated in the relevant paragraphs, and  has  proceeded  on  the
assumption  that the detenu has been remanded even under <a href="/doc/1312751/" id="a_7">Section 4</a>(1-A) of the
TNP Act, 1937.  Therefore, it is a clear-cut case for non-application of  mind
at  the  time  of  passing  of  the detention order, as a result of which, the
detention order definitely gets vitiated in law, and in  these  circumstances,
this  Court  is left with no choice but to quash the detention order passed by
the second respondent herein.
</p>
<p id="p_5">                5.  This Court's attention is also drawn to an  earlier  order
passed  by  a  Division  Bench  of  this Court, wherein the Division Bench has
decided a  similar  question  involved  in  H.C.P.    No.1026  of  2003  dated
19.11.2003  and  it is relevant to extract the operative portion of the order,
which is extracted hereunder :
</p><p id="p_6">        "Learned counsel  for  the  petitioner  contends  that  the  order  of
detention  is  vitiated  by  non-  application  of mind, in that, the order of
detention proceeds as if the detenu has been remanded for all the offences for
which the crime has been registered while the remand order reflects  that  the
remand  has been made only in respect of the offences under Sections 4(1)(aaa)
and 4(a)(i) of the Tamilnadu Prohibition Act.  The detaining authority  should
have called  for  a  report  in  this respect.  At the time of remand, <a href="/doc/1312751/" id="a_8">Section
4</a>(1-A) was deleted by the Magistrate.  As  what  has  been  seized  under  the
mahazar  has  not  been  produced before the Court, the Magistrate declined to
order remand for the offences under <a href="/doc/1312751/" id="a_9">Section 4</a>(1-A).  Therefore, there is  non-
application of  mind.    It is pointed out that the detaining authority should
have called for a report in this respect and without calling for a report, the
order of detention has been passed as if the  detenu  has  committed  all  the
offences  as  has been registered against him in the first information report.
This renders the detention illegal."
</p>
<p id="p_7">                6.  Falling in line with  the  above  order  of  the  Division
Bench,  since  the  present case is on similar set of facts and circumstances,
this Court has to pass its order in the following manner :-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">                In result,
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">                (i) the above Habeas Corpus Petition is allowed;</blockquote>

<p id="p_8">                (ii) the detention order dated 26.2.2004 made  in  COC.13/2004
by the second respondent herein is quashed;
</p>
<p id="p_9">                (iii) the detenu,  viz.,  J.    Ravi,  S/o.    Jeganathan,  is
directed to be set at liberty forthwith unless his detention  is  required  in
any other case.
