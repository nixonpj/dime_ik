FILED BY THE RESPONDENT POLICE IN CR.NO.34/2018
AND C.C.NO.6377/2018 FOR THE OFFENCE P/U/S 338
AND 288 OF <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_1">IPC</a>, PENDING ON THE FILE OF II
ADDL.C.M.M., BENGALURU.

    THIS CRIMINAL PETITION COMING ON               FOR
ADMISSION THIS DAY, THE COURT MADE                 THE
FOLLOWING:


                      ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">     Petitioners who are arraigned as accused Nos.1

and 3 in C.C.No.6377/2018 registered for the offence

punishable under <a href="/doc/1721129/" id="a_2">Sections 338</a> and <a href="/doc/207785/" id="a_3">288</a> of IPC, are

before this Court for quashing of said proceedings

pending on the file of II Additional Chief Metropolitan

Magistrate, Bengaluru.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">     2.    I have heard the arguments of Smt. Raksha

Keerthana K, learned Advocate appearing on behalf of

Sri. Kemparaju, for petitioners and Sri. S. Rachaiah,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                            3</span>


learned HCGP appearing for respondent No.1 and

notice to respondent No.2 stands dispensed with.


</p><p id="p_4">     3.    Second respondent-complainant is a mason,

who was working at an undisputed point of time with

accused No.2- Sri. Palani and he had undertaken

construction of residential building at J.P. Nagar, 7th

phase belonging to petitioners. On 25.12.2017 at about

9.00 a.m. first petitioner (accused No.1) along with

accused No.2 visited the said building which was under

construction   and   accused   No.2   is   said   to   have

instructed complainant to immediately carryout the

plastering work on the out side of the 7th floor and at

that point of time, complainant requested for helmet

and safety belt being provided and accused Nos. 1 and

2 is said to have informed complainant that they have

been carrying out construction activity from past thirty

years and nothing would happen if plastering work is

carried out in 7th floor even without safety belt and

helmet. Hence, petitioners are said to have directed

complainant to carry out plastering work.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                              4</span>



</p><p id="p_5">     4.     It is the grievance of the complainant that

he had carried out said work as directed, as he had no

option but to follow the dictates of his employer

including petitioner in order to eke out his livelihood

and while attending to said work by standing on the

centering board it gave away as such he had slipped

and fallen from 7th floor resulting in grievous injuries

being sustained to hand and legs, as a consequence of

which his right hand was cut and thigh bone was

fractured apart from sustaining other serious grievous

injuries. Hence, he sought for suitable action being

taken against accused persons.
</p>
<p id="p_6">
</p><p id="p_7">     5.     Jurisdictional       police   registered     said

compliant   in    Crime   No.34/2018      for   the    offence

punishable under <a href="/doc/1721129/" id="a_4">Sections 338</a> against accused Nos. 1

and 2 initially   and after completion of investigation

they have arraigned second petitioner i.e., wife of first

petitioner as accused No.3. Hence, petitioners are

before this Court for quashing of said proceedings.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                              5</span>


</p><p id="p_8">     6.    It   is   the   contention   of   Smt.   Raksha

Keerthana K, learned Advocate appearing on behalf of

Sri. Kemparaju, for petitioners that filing of charge

sheet against petitioners is without any foundation and

there being no material whatsoever, to implicate

petitioners and they have been arraigned as accused.

Hence, she prays for quashing the proceedings.


</p><p id="p_9">     7.    She would also rely upon the purported

agreement said to have been entered into by the

petitioner with accused No.2 (contractor) to contend

that it would be the contractor (accused No.2) who had

to take responsibility for providing safety measures to

workmen and as such no mens-rea can be attributable

to petitioners merely because they are owners of the

building. Hence, she prays for allowing the petition and

quashing the proceedings.
</p>
<p id="p_10">
</p><p id="p_11">     8.    Per contra, Sri. S. Rachaiah, learned HCGP

appearing for respondent No.1 would support filing of

charge sheet which would disclose offence alleged

against petitioners including accused No.2 (not before
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                              6</span>


this Court).   As such, he prays for dismissal of the

petition.
</p>
<p id="p_12">
</p><p id="p_13">      9.    Having   heard       the   learned   Advocates

appearing for parties and on perusal of          records it

would disclose that in the complaint itself it is

specifically alleged by second respondent complaining

to the effect that first petitioner and second respondent

were present at the spot and it is only on their

directions he was perforced to carryout the work

without any safety measures being extended to him.

Thus, prima facie of <a href="/doc/1721129/" id="a_5">Sections 338</a> and <a href="/doc/207785/" id="a_6">288</a> of IPC would

be attracted. As to whether there was negligence on the

part of accused-petitioners or otherwise is a matter

which will have to be examined by trial Court after

prosecution examines its witnesses. At this juncture,

this Court cannot undertake the exercise of analyzing

the charge sheet material to arrive at a conclusion as to

whether no guilt can be attributable to petitioner No.1

or not. Hence, this Court is of the considered view that

insofar as accused No.1 (first petitioner) is concerned
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                              7</span>


there is no ground to entertain this petition. However,

accused No.2 is concerned, who is wife of the petitioner

No.1 is the owner of the premises in which accident

took place and she has been arraigned as accused No.3

in C.C.No.6377/2018 and said proceedings cannot be

proceeded against her inasmuch in the event of charge

sheet material were to remain un-rebutted, it would not

end in conviction of accused No.3 i.e., second petitioner

herein. Merely because she happens to be the owner of

the building, she cannot be proceeded with particularly

when there is no allegation of any negligent act

attributable to her. In the absence thereof, no mens-rea

is attributable to second petitioner or willful neglect on

her part.    In such circumstances title holder of the

property cannot be prosecuted and convicted thereafter.

In the light of categorical statement made by the

witnesses that accused Nos.1 and 2 were present at the

spot   and    on   their   direction,   complainant   had

undertaken plastering work at 7th floor of the building,

they are being proceeded with. Hence, there being no
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                               8</span>


act attributed to accused No.3 for any neglect, she

cannot be proceeded with.
