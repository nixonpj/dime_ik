<div class="doc_title">Biram Mardi vs The State Of Jharkhand on 18 November, 2019</div><pre id="pre_1">            IN THE HIGH COURT OF JHARKHAND AT RANCHI
                          Criminal Revision No. 101 of 2014
                                      ---
</pre><pre id="pre_2">            Biram Mardi                            ...     ...     Petitioner
                                     Versus
            The State of Jharkhand                 ...     ...     Opp. party

      CORAM       : HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE DEEPAK ROSHAN
                                     ---
            For the Petitioner       : Mr. P. S. A. Swaroop Pati, Advocate
            For the State            : Mr. P. D. Agarwal, Spl. P.P.
                                     ---
03/18.11.2019     The instant application is directed against the judgment dated
</pre><p id="p_1">           21.12.2013 passed by the learned District &amp; Additional Sessions Judge-
           I, Ghatshila, whereby the appeal preferred by the petitioner being
           Criminal Appeal No. 113 of 2013 has been dismissed and the judgment
           of conviction and order of sentence passed by the learned Judicial
           Magistrate, 1st Class, Ghatshila in G. R. Case No. 377 of 2006 (T. R. No.
           67 of 2013), has been sustained whereby the petitioner has been
           convicted for the offences under <a href="/doc/1270101/" id="a_1">Sections 279</a>, <a href="/doc/1402213/" id="a_2">337</a>, <a href="/doc/1721129/" id="a_3">338</a> and <a href="/doc/1371604/" id="a_4">304A</a> of the
           Indian Penal Code and has been sentenced for four months, four
           months, one and half years and one and half years for each offences
           respectively.
</p><p id="p_2">                 The learned counsel for the petitioner submits that practically
           there is only one eye-witness who was also on the motorcycle which
           was dashed by the truck bearing Registration No. WB 33 4111. He
           further submits that three people should not have seated over the
           motorcycle. He further submits that the petitioner is now an old man
           and is aged about sixty years and, therefore, it would not be fruitful to
           send him back to prison.
</p><p id="p_3">                 Per contra, the learned Spl. P. P. supports the impugned orders
           and submits that so far as the identification of the accused is
           concerned, P.W.s 1, 2, 3 and 4 have categorically claimed to identify the
           accused. In this view of the matter, the instant application deserves to
           be dismissed.
</p><p id="p_4">                 Having heard learned counsel for the parties and after going
           through the impugned orders including the lower court record and
           keeping in mind the scope of revisional jurisdiction, I am not inclined
           to interfere with the finding of the courts below and as such the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                            -2-</span>
          judgment of conviction passed by the learned trial court and upheld by
          the learned appellate court is, hereby, confirmed.
</p><p id="p_5">                However, so far as sentence is concerned, it is apparent that the
          instant case is of the year 2006 and more than thirteen years have
          elapsed and the petitioner must have suffered the rigors of litigation
          for the last thirteen years and also remained in custody for some time.
          It is not stated that the petitioner has ever misused the privilege of bail.
          Further, the incident does not reflect any cruelty on the part of the
          petitioner or any mental depravity. In a situation of this nature, I am of
          the opinion that it may not be proper for this Court to send the accused
          back to prison. However, from the facts of the case, it is apparent that
          one injured succumbed to injury and the informant and his family
          members must have suffered the pains at the hands of the petitioner as
          such I am of the opinion that the petitioner should pay fine of
          Rs. 25,000/- to the legal heirs of the deceased.
</p><p id="p_6">                Thus, the sentence passed by the courts below is, hereby,
          modified to the extent that the petitioner is sentenced to undergo for
          the period already undergone subject to the payment of Rs. 25,000/-
          which shall be paid before the learned trial court who in turn will pay
          the same to the informant/legal heirs of the deceased.
</p><p id="p_7">                With the aforesaid observations, directions and modification, the
          instant revision application stands disposed of.
</p><p id="p_8">                The petitioner shall be discharged from the liability of his bail
          bonds after furnishing the aforesaid condition.
</p><p id="p_9">                Let the lower court record be sent back to the concerned court
          forthwith.
</p><p id="p_10">                Let a copy of this order be communicated through FAX to the
          court concerned.
</p><p id="p_11">                                                               (Deepak Roshan, J.)
