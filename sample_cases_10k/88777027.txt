In the court of Sh. ASHWANI SARPAL, Additional District Judge-05
             Room No. 119, Tis Hazari Court, (West) Delhi.

Sh. Abhishek Chaswal              Versus              State

                        (PC No. : 147/08/05)

           (Petition for grant of Succession Certificate
          under <a href="/doc/105862/" id="a_1">Section 372</a> of the Indian Succession Act )
                         *********************

JUDGMENT :
</pre>
<p id="p_1">1.         Sh. Abhishek Chaswal initially filed the petition for grant of
Succession Certificate in the court on 12-9-2005 which was later on got
amended and relief of grant of Letter of Administration was sought. Sh.
Balram Chaswal father of the petitioner died at Delhi on 13-11-2002
without leaving behind any Will and his mother predeceased him on 28-
6-1999. As per averments, made in the petition and affidavit filed by
the petitioner, there is no other legal heir of the deceased except
himself. The deceased Sh. Balram Chaswal had some movable assets in
bank locker no. 308, Central Bank of India, Kirti Nagar, New Delhi.
</p>

<p id="p_2">2.         The notice of this petition was sent to the State. The general
public was also informed by way of beat of drum. Despite service of
notice upon State and and general public, no one on behalf of the State
or on behalf of the general public appeared to contest the claim made
by the petitioner. A Local Commissioner was appointed who made an
inventory of the articles found from the locker in question and
Government Approved Valuer assessed its value at the rate of
Rs.54,985/-.
</p>

<p id="p_3">3.         In order to prove his case, petitioner examined himself as
PW-1 and corroborated the averments made in the petition and also
proved the relevant documents i.e. death certificates of his parents as
Ex. PW-1/1 and Ex. PW-1/2. He also proved the report of the local
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                         2</span>


commissioner as Ex. PW-1/3. In his affidavit, petitioner specifically
stated that deceased had left behind no legal heir except himself. The
testimony of the petitioner remained unrebutted and unchallenged and
as such there is no other reason to disbelieve him.
</p>

<p id="p_4">4.          Under<a href="/doc/235332/" id="a_2"> S. 218</a> of the Indian Succession Act, Letters of
Administration can be granted to any person, who according to the
rules of the distribution of estate applicable in case of such deceased, is
entitled to the whole or any part of the deceased's estate. The petitioner
falls in category of Class-I heir of the deceased and in absence of any
other legal heir, isotherwise entitled to succeed to the estate of deceased
Sh. Balram Chaswal.
</p>

<p id="p_5">5.          Having regard to the averments made in the petition and the
testimony of the petitioner, which has gone unrebutted and the
petitioner being Class-I heir of the deceased, I allow the present petition
and it is ordered that Letter of Administration without any Will be
granted in favour of the petitioner in respect of locker no. 308, Central
Bank of India, Kirti Nagar, New Delhi subject to his furnishing requisite
court fee as per the report of the Government Approved Valuer,
administration bond cum surety bond.        An inventory of the movable
property of the deceased shall be exhibited in the court within six
months from the date of grant of Letters of Administration and a
statement of account shall be filed within one year thereafter.       It is
clarified that right, title and ownership of contents of the locker is not
decided by this Court.
</p>

<p id="p_6">           File be consigned to the Record Room.</p><pre id="pre_2">
