                    The present challenge is directed against an order, whereby

             an application filed by the plaintiff/opposite party under Order

             XXXVIII Rule 5 of the Code of Civil Procedure was adjudicated

             upon by directing the defendant/petitioner to furnish security of a

             bank guarantee of Rs.8,50,000/- to be drawn on any nationalised

             bank by October 05, 2018 and that the said security should be

             continued till disposal of the suit.
</p>
<p id="p_4">                    Learned counsel for the petitioner argues that none of the

             ingredients of Order XXXVIII Rule 5 of the Code of Civil Procedure

             were reflected from the impugned order.        The trial court only

             proceeded on the premise that it was satisfied about the

             transactions held between the parties and their latest position,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                             2</span>


which was insufficient in law to pass a stringent order under

Order XXXVIII Rule 5 of the Code of Civil Procedure.

</p><p id="p_5">     Learned counsel for the petitioner places reliance on the

contents of certain paragraphs of the application for attachment

before judgment, in particular paragraph nos. 22 and 23 thereof,

to show the scope of the application-in-question. Learned counsel

for the petitioner further places reliance on the contents of the

affidavit-in-opposition to the said application to impress upon this

Court that the petitioner had a specific counter-case for set off. It

is argued that the trial court acted without jurisdiction in passing

the order under Order XXXVIII Rule 5 of the Code of Civil

Procedure in a cursory manner merely paying lip-service to the

provisions of the statute, but not adverting to the facts of the case

vis-Ã -vis such provision.
</p>
<p id="p_6">     Learned counsel for the petitioner places reliance upon a

judgment, reported at (2008) 2 SCC 302 (Raman Tech. &amp; <a href="/doc/9447/" id="a_1">Process

Engg. Co. &amp; Anr. vs. Solanki Traders</a>), for the proposition that

before exercising the power under Order XXXVIII Rule 5 of the

Code of Civil Procedure, the court should be satisfied that there is

a reasonable chance of a decree being passed in the suit against

the defendant. Further, he needs to establish that the defendant

is attempting to remove or dispose of his assets with the intention

of defeating the decree that may be passed. It was further held in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                           3</span>


the said judgment that the power under Order XXXVIII Rule 5 of

the Code of Civil Procedure is a drastic and extraordinary power,

which should not be exercised mechanically or merely for the

asking and should be used sparingly and strictly in accordance

with the Rule. It was held that the purpose of Order XXXVIII Rule

5 of the Code was not to convert an unsecured debt into a secured

debt and any attempt by a plaintiff to utilise the provisions of

Order XXXVIII Rule 5 of the Code as a leverage for coercing the

defendant to settle the suit claim should be discouraged.

</p><p id="p_7">     Learned counsel for the petitioner next cites a judgment,

reported at AIR 2011 Calcutta 29 (<a href="/doc/89184845/" id="a_2">Kohinoor Steel Private Ltd. vs.

Pravesh Chandra Kapoor</a>). A Division Bench of this Court held in

the said judgment, inter alia, that the affidavits in support of the

contentions of the applicant, must not be vague and must be

properly verified and that a mere allegation that the defendant was

selling off his properties was not enough; particulars must be

stated.
</p>
<p id="p_8">     It was further held in the said judgment that on the basis of

vague allegations, as made in the said reported case, no order or

direction to give security or injunction in the form of attachment

could be passed. The names of the alleged creditors, whose debts

the defendant was unable to pay, were also not disclosed. In the

opinion of the Division Bench, it was not the law of the land that a
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                           4</span>


defendant in a money suit must show that his earning was

sufficient to pay off the decretal amount if the suit was ultimately

decreed, otherwise, he should suffer an order of injunction in the

form of attachment before judgment or should give security during

the pendency of the suit. The Division Bench relied on certain

judgments of the Supreme Court while making such observations.

</p><p id="p_9">     Learned counsel for the petitioner also cites another Division

Bench judgment, reported at AIR 2004 Calcutta 58 (<a href="/doc/616456/" id="a_3">M/s. R.B.M.

Pati Joint Venture vs. M/s. Bengal Builders</a>), wherein it was held

that the Court was entitled to exercise the power of attachment

before judgment only when the defendant, with intent to obstruct

or delay the execution of any decree that may be passed against

him, was about to dispose of the whole or any part of his property

from the local limits of the jurisdiction of the Court. From the

impugned order in that case, it appeared to the Court that the said

aspects were not at all taken into consideration and no satisfaction

in that respect was recorded by the trial court.      As such, the

Division Bench held that the order impugned therein, not being in

consonance with the guidelines of the Supreme Court made in

several cases, could not stand.
</p>
<p id="p_10">     Learned counsel for the petitioner next cites a judgment of a

Division Bench of the Bombay High Court, reported at AIR 2002

Bombay 203, (Saraswat Co-operative Bank Ltd. Vs. Chandrakant
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                           5</span>


Maganlal Shah &amp; Ors.). In paragraph 24 of the said judgment, the

Division Bench held, inter alia, that an order under Order XXXVIII

Rule 5 of the Code of Civil Procedure was not to be made lightly

nor based on bald averments reiterating the statutory provisions.

There had to be some prima facie material, on the basis of which

the Court could satisfy itself that the condition requisite for

making an order of attachment before judgment enumerated in

Order XXXVIII of the Code existed. Otherwise, it was held, every

plaintiff would rush in with a bald averment like the one made by

the bank therein and obtain an attachment before judgment.

</p><p id="p_11">     Learned counsel for the petitioner then cites a judgment

reported at AIR 1985 Karnataka 282 (<a href="/doc/1552408/" id="a_4">Palghar Rolling Mills Pvt. Ltd.

vs. Visvesvaraya Iron and Steel Ltd. &amp; Anr</a>.), wherein it was held

that if the order passed by the Court does not speak or show that

the Court had applied its mind to the requirements of Order

XXXVIII Rule 5 of the Code of Civil Procedure or if the order passed

by the court below did not show clearly that it had considered the

materials on record or if the order did not show that the court was

satisfied that the defendant, with intent to obstruct or delay the

execution of any decree that may be passed against him or about

to dispose of the whole or any part of the property, the order would

be in violation of Order XXXVIII Rule 5 of the Code of Civil

Procedure, as it stood before the amendment in 1976, would be at
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                           6</span>


the most rendered such order irregular. But, now sub-rule (4)

inserted by Section 85(1) of the Act of 104 of 1976 reads that if an

order of attachment is made without complying with the provisions

of sub-rule (1) of Rule 5 of Order XXXVIII, such attachment shall

be void. Sub-rule (4) has been inserted with a view to see that the

Court did not pass such an extraordinary order in a cavalier

manner and without satisfying themselves about the requirements

of Order XXXVIII Rule 5 of the Code of Civil Procedure.

</p><p id="p_12">       In controverting such arguments, learned counsel for the

opposite party argues that the present revision arose from a

commercial matter, in which the tests stipulated in Order XXXVIII

Rule 5 of the Code have to be taken in a somewhat different light.

In such matters, in a genuine case having been made out by the

plaintiff, and in that event the defence thereto was of an illusory

nature, the court should not be hesitant in passing an order of

attachment before judgment.
</p>
<p id="p_13">       In this context, learned counsel cites an unreported

judgment of a co-ordinate Bench of this Court, dated August 5,

2015, rendered in G.A. No.1840 of 2014 (C.S. No.202 of 2014)

(Shree Krishan Binani and another Vs. Progressive Constructions

Limited). Learned single Judge, in the said judgment, held, inter

alia, upon a consideration of the facts of the case, that there was

no dispute that the plaintiff had supplied goods to the defendant
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                            7</span>


between January 2009 and April 2011.             The defendant also

admitted to have paid a sum in part payment of such dues. The

defendant therein had failed to establish that the goods were of

inferior quality or that the goods sold in April 2011 were returned

to the plaintiff as alleged by the defendant in the said case.

Certain letters relied upon by the defendant did not show or prima

facie establish that the goods were returned due to inferior quality

or that the amounts paid by the defendant were in full and final

settlement of all claims between the parties. Certain other

conditions as to the circumstances of certain letters being obscure

were also taken into consideration by the learned single Judge. It

was observed that no reason was forthcoming as to why the

defendant in such important matters, and when it sought to deny

its liabilities, decided to send the letters by courier. The learned

single Judge held that it was more doubtful than met the eyes as

regards the despatch of the letters. Learned single Judge went on

to hold that the said court doubted genuinity of the letters-in-

question and also considered whether, notwithstanding the

existence of the said letters, the plaintiff would still be entitled to

an order of attachment on the basis of the pleadings.              The

judgment which was cited at the bar before the said Court did not,

according to the learned single Judge, suggest that the Court

would be a lame duck if it appears to the Court that the very
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                           8</span>


intention is to defraud the creditors and for the ends of justice

some protective order was necessary. Any other interpretation or

restriction on the power of the Court to pass equitable orders on

the basis of genuinity of the claim would result in injustice to the

plaintiff and would defeat the very object and purpose of the Code.

The learned single Judge further held that the sanctity of

commercial transactions and the trade requires that the Court

must come to the aid of the plaintiff who has been able to establish

a strong prima facie case and a valid claim. Learned single Judge

held that the plaintiff in the said case had been able to establish

and demonstrate that his claim was more than bona fide and valid,

inasmuch as there was hardly any defence disclosed in the

affidavit filed by the defendant which could really nullify the claim

of the plaintiff or inspire confidence in the mind of the Court with

regard to the defence of the defendant. The defendant did not deny

the transaction and delivery of the goods and its utilization in the

said case. It also did not disclose anything to show that it was

otherwise solvent and in the event any decree was passed, the

same would not be rendered infructuous.
</p>
<p id="p_14">       Learned counsel for the opposite party also cites a

judgment reported at (1977) 2 Supreme Court Cases 437 (Trimbak

Gangadhar Telang and another Vs. Ramchandra Ganesh Bhide and

others) wherein it was held that it was only when an order of a
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                           9</span>


Tribunal was violative of the fundamental basic principles of

justice and fair play or where a patent or flagrant error in

procedure of law has crept in or where the order passed resulted in

manifest injustice, the court could justifiably intervene under

<a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_5">Article 227</a> of the Constitution.
</p>
<p id="p_15">       Learned counsel submits that in view of the trial court

having adhered to the cardinal yardsticks in so far as the

commercial matters are concerned, as reflected from the cited

unreported judgment, no interference under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_6">Article 227</a> of the

Constitution which justified, since none of the criteria stipulated in

the judgment of the Supreme Court cited by the opposite party

were involved in the present case.
</p>
<p id="p_16">      Considering the contents of the impugned order in the light

of the cited judgments, it appears that although the trial court

quoted the provisions of Order XXXVIII Rule 5 of the Code and also

the judgments cited by the parties, certain sentences were culled

out from the proposition laid down in the cited judgement. For

example, the trial court recorded that the parties under Order

XXXVIII Rule 5 of the Code was not to convert an unsecured debt

into a secured debt. This sentence was chosen from the ratio laid

down in Raman Tech. (supra), wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court

had laid down, in the sentences immediately preceding the one

quoted above, that the power under Order XXXVIII Rule 5 of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                            10</span>


Code of Civil Procedure was a drastic and extraordinary power and

should not be exercised mechanically or merely for the asking and

that it should be used sparingly and strictly in accordance with the

Rule. Read in such context, the quoted sentence of the impugned

order, acquires an entirely different meaning than that attributed

to by the trial court. The tenor of the concerned judgment of the

Supreme Court was that before exercising the extraordinary power

under the said Rule, the Court should be satisfied that there was a

reasonable chance of a decree being passed in the suit against the

defendant.    Further, the plaintiff needed to establish that the

defendant was attempting to remove or dispose of his assets with

the intention of defeating the decree that may be passed.     Several

judgments of the Apex Court have held that the power under Order

XXXVIII Rule 5 was of an extraordinary nature and should be

exercised only in cases where drastic measures are necessary.

</p><p id="p_17">       In the impugned order, however, no such satisfaction was

recorded.    The trial court proceeded on the premise that there had

been transactions in between the parties and that the photocopies

of documents as annexure in connection with the application

under Order XXXVIII Rule 5 of the Code inspired the Court to hold

that prima facie the plaintiff/petitioner at least satisfied the court

about the transactions held in between the parties and their

present latest position.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                            11</span><p id="p_18">


</p><p id="p_19">       If the said findings are read in the context of the unreported

judgment of a co-ordinate Bench cited by the opposite party, it is

seen that the said learned single Judge considered the entire

conspectus of the respective cases of the parties and the materials

on   record   involved   therein.    Moreover,    it   was   specifically

considered by the learned single Judge that the court should not

be a lame duck if it appeared to the Court that the very intention

was to defraud the creditors and for the ends of justice some

protective order was necessary. Even apparent genuinity of the

claim of the plaintiff and the apparent weakness of the defence

case come into play the Court cannot shut its eyes, specifically to

the requirements of Rule 5 Order XXXVIII of the Code of Civil

Procedure. The said Rule is quoted below:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">            "5.Where defendant may be called upon to furnish
     security for production of property. - (1) Where, at any
     stage of a suit, the Court is satisfied, by affidavit or otherwise,
     that the defendant, with intent to obstruct or delay the
     execution of any decree that may be passed against him, -
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">           (a) is about to dispose of the whole or any part of his
               property, or
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">           (b) is about to remove the whole or any part of his
               property from the local limits of the jurisdiction of the
               Court,
            the Court may direct the defendant, within a time to be
     fixed by it, either to furnish security, in such sum as may be
     specified in the order, to produce and place at the disposal of
     the Court, when required, the said property or the value of the
     same, or such portion thereof as may be sufficient to satisfy
     the decree, or to appear and show cause why he should not
     furnish security.</blockquote>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                          12</span>


<blockquote id="blockquote_4">          (2) The plaintiff shall, unless the Court otherwise
    directs, specify the property required to be attached and the
    estimated value thereof.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">          (3) The Court may also in the order direct the
    conditional attachment of the whole or any portion of the
    property so specified.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">          (4) If an order of attachment is made without complying
    with the provisions of sub-rule (1) of this rule, such
    attachment shall be void."</blockquote><p id="p_20">


</p><p id="p_21">       In the present case, the trial Judge did not record any

finding as to the defendant being about to dispose of the whole or

any part of his property or to remove the whole or part of the

property for the local limits of the jurisdiction of the court.   As

such, in the absence of such specific findings and/or any

satisfaction being recorded as to the defendant doing with the

intention to obstruct or delay the execution of the decree that may

be passed against him, the impugned order would merely be void,

as envisaged in Rule 5(4) of Order XXXVIII of the Code of Civil

Procedure.
</p>
<p id="p_22">       The judgment of the co-ordinate Bench, although contained

some allegations and counter allegations similar to the present

case, dealt with the materials on record in detail and had come to

categorical findings as to the ingredients of Order XXXVIII Rule 5

which was entirely absent in the present impugned order.

</p><p id="p_23">       As to the facts of the case, almost nothing was considered

by the trial court except the transactions which took place between
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                                13</span>


the parties, merely on the affidavits of the parties. Only lip-service

was paid, as correctly submitted by learned counsel for the

petitioner, to the provisions of the statute, which were not

sufficient     for   the   court    to   issue   an   extreme   measure   as

contemplated in Order XXXVIII Rule 5 of the Code.

</p><p id="p_24">       As such, the impugned order suffers from a patent and

flagrant error, both of procedure and law, and suffer from manifest

injustice.       In such view of the matter, even taking into

consideration the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court cited by

the opposite party, the impugned order cannot be sustained.

Accordingly, C.O. No.3297 of 2018 is allowed on contest, thereby

setting aside the impugned order.
