      This appeal coming on for Final Hearing this day, the
Court delivered the following:

                       JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">     The       above   appeal   is   preferred    against   the

judgment and award dated 17.02.2009 passed in MVC

No.1336/2004 on the file of the Civil Judge (Sr.Dn.) and

MACT, Maddur,


</p><p id="p_2">     2. The brief facts leading to the filing of the said

case are: that on 01.06.2004 at about 4.30 p.m. while

victim was going as a pillion rider on motor bike bearing

registration     No.   AP-9-AM-2809       along     with    one

Narasimhareddy who was the rider of the said vehicle

from Maddur town to Shivapura on the left side of the

Bangalore-Mysore road slowly and cautiously, the

KSRTC bus bearing registration No. KA-07-F-627 being

driven by its driver with high speed in a rash manner

dashed against the said motor bike and caused the

accident, on account of which, both the rider as well as
                                         MFA No.4531/2009

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                            3</span>

the pillion rider sustained grievous injuries and they

were shifted to Government Hospital Maddur and then,

they were referred to NIMHANS Hospital, Bangalore.

The pillion rider of the vehicle succumbed to the injuries

so sustained by him in the motor accident at NIMHANS,

Bangalore on the same day i.e., on 01.06.2004 at about

11.30 p.m; it is further contended by the claimant that

the said deceased Abdul Riyaz is survived by his wife -

the claimant in the case and the victim was aged about

30 years working as vehicle tinkerer with an income of

Rs.10,000/- p.m. and on account of such untimely

accidental death of the victim, the claimant being wife is

not only put to mental shock and agony, but, also to

loss of dependency and as such she sought awarding of

compensation from the respondent/Corporation and the

owner of the bus involved in the accident.


</p><p id="p_3">     3.    The Tribunal by considering the evidence

placed on record deemed it fit to award a sum of

Rs.4,50,000/- with interest at the rate of 6% p.a. from
                                                      MFA No.4531/2009

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                  4</span>

the     date   of    petition   till        realisation   against   the

respondent.
</p>
<p id="p_4">
</p><p id="p_5">        4. Aggrieved by the said judgment and award, the

respondent/Corporation            is         in    appeal     interalia

contending amongst other grounds that the Tribunal

failed to consider that the accident occurred solely due

to the negligence of the motor cyclist and more

particularly as the police documents clearly show that

the motor cyclist was rash and was responsible for

causing the accident. The Tribunal further failed to see

that the motor cyclist entered the main road from the

cross road and dashed the bus and as such the finding

given    by    the    Tribunal         is    arbitrary,   illegal   and

unjustified.
</p>
<p id="p_6">
</p><p id="p_7">        5. Learned Counsel for the appellant submits that

both the FIR and charge sheet are filed against the rider

of the motor bike which is conclusive that the driver of

the bus is in no way responsible for the cause of the

accident and as such the entire liability ought to have
                                                MFA No.4531/2009

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                   5</span>

been on the owner and insurer of the motor bike of

which the victim was the pillion rider and the petition

filed against the KSRTC is not proper as the same is not

maintainable; further he submits that the statement

given by the owner of the motor bike before the

investigating officer in the criminal case is that the

accident occurred on account of the rash riding of the

motor bike and the Tribunal ought to have considered

all those aspects and held that the accident occurred on

account of the rash driving of the motor bike and not on

account of any negligence on the part of the driver of the

bus.
</p>
<p id="p_8">
</p><p id="p_9">          6.   Per     contra,    learned   Counsel   for    the

respondent/claimant submitted that in the facts and

circumstances of the case, the finding given by the

Tribunal with regard to the cause of accident is just and

proper and the same does not call for interference.


</p><p id="p_10">          7. On perusal of the records before the Tribunal,

it   is    seen      that   the   appellant/Corporation   except
                                         MFA No.4531/2009

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                            6</span>

examining the driver of the vehicle has not chosen to

adduce any other evidence either documentary or oral

and the said driver of the vehicle stated in his affidavit

that when he was driving the vehicle carefully and

cautiously with slow speed around 4.30 p.m. near Kolli

Circle Point, Mysore Bangalore road, Maddur Town as

there was a narrow road, the motor cyclist along with

pillion rider came from opposite direction with high

speed in rash manner and dashed against his bus; to

avoid the possible accident, he took the bus to the right

side of the road despite which the accident occurred.

Thus irrespective of the reason assigned that he took

the bus to the right side of the road to avoid the

accident, it is seen that the accident has occurred on

the right side of the road on which the KSRTC bus was

proceeding.
</p>
<p id="p_11">
</p><p id="p_12">     8.   Though     the   learned   Counsel     for   the

appellant/Corporation contended that the owner of the

two wheeler had given the statement implicating the
                                         MFA No.4531/2009

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                           7</span>

rider of the motor bike, the appellant/Corporation has

not taken any steps to summon the said person as a

witness in the said case. In the circumstances, such a

submission of the learned Counsel cannot be accepted

and the said statement cannot be relied upon for any

purpose.
</p>
<p id="p_13">
</p><p id="p_14">     9.     In the foregoing circumstances, as the

appellant/Corporation has failed to prove its contention

that the accident occurred on account of the rash riding

of the motor bike and it is in no way responsible for the

accident in question and the observation made by the

Tribunal that the accident occurred on account of the

rash driving of the bus by its driver, does not call for

interference.   Further in any event admittedly the

accident has occurred on account of involvement of two

vehicles viz., motor bike bearing registration No. AP-9-

AM 2809 and KSRTC bus bearing registration No. KA -

07-F- 627. Likewise admittedly the victim was a pillion

rider. In the circumstances, irrespective of percentage
                                         MFA No.4531/2009

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                            8</span>

of negligence on each of the driver of the vehicles in

relation to the death of the pillion rider, the cause of

accident will be composite negligence on the part of the

drivers of both vehicles and the claimant claiming on

account of the death of the pillion rider is allowed to

prefer a claim petition against any one of them or

against both of them as their liability is joint and

several.
</p>
<p id="p_15">
</p><p id="p_16">     10.   For these reasons, the impugned judgment

and award does not call for interference. Accordingly,

the above appeal is liable to be dismissed.

the Tribunal for disbursement.
