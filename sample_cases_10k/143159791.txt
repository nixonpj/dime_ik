5/31.7.2014</pre><p id="p_1">       Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and the learned counsel

 for the State.
</p>
<p id="p_2"> 2.               The petitioner is aggrieved by the orders dated 8.12.2006 passed by

 the learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Palamau at Daltonganj, in C.F Case

 Nos. 351 of 2006, 358 of 2006 &amp; 350 of 2006, whereby, the cognizance has been

 taken against the petitioner and the other co-accused persons for the offence

 under <a href="/doc/1914151/" id="a_1">Sections 33</a>, <a href="/doc/446874/" id="a_2">41</a> &amp; <a href="/doc/1568570/" id="a_3">42</a> of the Indian Forest Act. The petitioner has also

 prayed for quashing the entire criminal proceedings against him in the said cases.

</p><p id="p_3"> 3.               The offence reports in all these three cases show that on 30.4.2005,

 2.5.2005 &amp; 25.4.2005, the Forest Guard found that some labours were engaged in

 mining process in the protected forest and upon objection by the forest guard,

 they did not stop the mining work. Accordingly, the offence reports were

 submitted by the forest guard. The petitioner is not named in the said reports.

 Subsequently, the prosecution reports were submitted after enquiry, in which, the

 petitioner has been made accused being the proprietor of Chotanagpur Graphite

 Industries, which was found to be engaged in the mining process.

</p><p id="p_4"> 4.               Learned counsel for the petitioner has taken a short point in

 challenging the impugned order, submitting that there is no provision for

 vicarious liability in the <a href="/doc/654536/" id="a_4">Indian Forest Act</a> and accordingly, the criminal

 proceedings against the petitioner, including the cognizance orders, cannot be
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                     -2-</span>

sustained in the eyes of law. In support of his contention, learned counsel for the

petitioner has placed reliance upon the decision of this Court in Md. Fasiuddin

&amp; Ors. Vs. State of Bihar (Now Jharkhand) &amp; Anr. reported in 2012 (3) JCR

602 (Jhr.), wherein, relying upon the decisions of the Apex Court in S.K. Alagh

Vs. State of U.P. &amp; Ors., reported in (2008) 5 SCC 662 and in Maharashtra

State Electricity Distribution Company Ltd. &amp; Anr. Vs. Datar Switchgear

Ltd. &amp; Ors., reported in (2010) 10 SCC 479, it has been held as follows :-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">                          "9. Thus, so far as the cognizance against these
                          petitioners of the offence under <a href="/doc/1914151/" id="a_5">Section 33</a> of the Indian
                          Forest Act is concerned, the case is fully covered by the
                          aforementioned decisions of the Supreme Court,
                          wherein, it has been specifically held that wherever
                          legal fiction of the vicarious liability is directed against
                          a person, who is otherwise not personally involved in
                          the commission of the offence, is made liable for the
                          same, it has to be specifically provided in the Statute
                          concerned. In <a href="/doc/1914151/" id="a_6">Section 33</a> of the Forest Act, there is no
                          provision for any vicarious liability and accordingly, in
                          absence of any specific averment / allegation against
                          the petitioners in the prosecution reports, the institution
                          of the cases against these petitioners under <a href="/doc/1914151/" id="a_7">Section 33</a>
                          of the Indian Forest Act and the cognizance taken
                          against them under the said Act are absolutely illegal
                          and the same cannot be sustained in the eyes of law."</blockquote><p id="p_5">
</p><p id="p_6">              Placing reliance on this decision, learned counsel for the petitioner

has submitted that the petitioner has been made accused in these cases only being

the proprietor of Chotanagpur Graphite Industries and he was not actually

present at the place of occurrence and accordingly, the impugned orders cannot

be sustained in the eyes of law.
</p>
<p id="p_7">5.            Learned counsel for the State, on the other hand, has opposed the

prayer and has submitted that the petitioner being the proprietor of the

Chotanagpur Graphite Industries, which was involved in the illegal mining in the

protected forest, is also liable for the offence.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                    -3-</span><p id="p_8">

</p><p id="p_9">6.            After having heard the learned counsels for both sides and upon

going through the records, I find that the case of the petitioner is fully covered by

the decision of this Court in Md. Fasiuddin's case (supra). It is apparent from

the offence reports dated 30.4.2005, 2.5.2005 &amp; 25.4.2005 that the petitioner was

not present at the place of occurrence and there is no allegation against him

therein, nor is he named therein. Only in the prosecution reports the petitioner

had been made accused, being the proprietor of Chotanagpur Graphite Industries,

without making any specific averment or allegation against him.

</p><p id="p_10">7.            In that view of the matter, there being no provision for any

vicarious liability in the <a href="/doc/654536/" id="a_8">Indian Forest Act</a>, I am of the considered view that the

prosecution of the petitioner cannot be sustained in the eyes of law. Accordingly,

the impugned orders dated 8.12.2006 passed by the learned Chief Judicial

Magistrate, Palamau at Daltonganj, in C.F Case Nos. 351 of 2006, 358 of 2006 &amp;

350 of 2006, so far as they relate to the petitioner only, as also the entire criminal

proceedings against the petitioner in the said cases, are hereby, quashed.

</p><p id="p_11">8.            All these applications are accordingly, allowed.
</p>
<p id="p_12">
</p><p id="p_13">                                                                 ( H. C. Mishra, J.)
