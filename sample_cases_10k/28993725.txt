                   Dated this the 21st day of May, 2015

                                    JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">             Appellant is the petitioner in O.P.(MV) No.1015 of 2002 on the

file of the Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal, Mavelikkara. He sustained

injuries in a motor accident. Tribunal found that the accident was due to

rash and negligent driving of an autorickshaw by the first respondent.

</p><p id="p_2">       2.    Heard the learned counsel for the appellant and the learned

counsel representing the insurance company.
</p>
<p id="p_3">       3.    According to the learned counsel for the appellant, the Tribunal

awarded only a meagre amount as compensation and that too, without

taking into account the major claims. The first information report itself

would show that the appellant was a salesman engaged in vending

candles. It is seen from the records that he had been in the hospital for a

total period of 11 days on two occasions. Tribunal has not considered the

admission of appellant to the hospital on the second occasion, viz., from

01.12.1999 to 08.12.1999. Learned counsel for the appellant submitted

that the Tribunal further omitted to consider the fact that during the second

admission, the appellant had to pay a sum of `4,864/- as hospitalisation

charges. The Tribunal has only taken this amount as `486.40 ps. It is also

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">MACA No.311/2012                      2</span>

the grievance of the appellant that no amount was granted as

compensation for loss of earnings in spite of the fact that he was in the

hospital for 11 days and confined to bed for a period of one month.

Likewise, no compensation was given for loss of amenities. It is seen from

the award that an amount of `3,500/- was given as compensation for pain

and suffering. The documents produced would show that the appellant had

undergone some minor surgical operation and, therefore, the amount

awarded as compensation for pain and suffering appears to be low.

Similarly bystander's expenses was also not correctly calculated. Hence to

meet the ends of justice and to provide a just and fair compensation has to

be paid to the appellant, following enhancements are made in the matter of

award.
</p>
<p id="p_4">              The appellant shall be paid an amount of `3,000/- towards loss

of income for a period of one month. Medical expenses awarded by the

Tribunal has to be enhanced by an amount of `4,864/- which was omitted

by the Tribunal. Bystander's expenses should have been `1,100/-. The

Tribunal has only granted `200/- and, therefore, in addition to that amount,

the appellant is entitled to get an additional amount of `900/- towards

bystander's expenses. Compensation for pain and suffering awarded by

the Tribunal at `3,500/- is low. The proper amount should have been

`5,000/- thereby necessitating an enhancement of `1,500/- in that head.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">MACA No.311/2012                      3</span>

The appellant shall be provided with compensation for loss of amenities to

a tune of `2,500/-. Therefore, the appellant is entitled to get enhanced

compensation of `12,764/- (Rupees twelve thousand seven hundred and

sixtyfour only) with 9% interest from the date of petition till recovery. The

insurance company shall deposit the modified award amount within a

period of one month from today.
</p>
<p id="p_5">              With these modifications, this appeal is disposed of.
