                           ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">      Sri Kiran Kumar T.L., the learned Additional Government

Advocate takes notice for the respondent.


</p><p id="p_2">      2.    It is the case of the petitioner that the petitioner's

father was granted the occupancy rights in respect of the land in

question by the Land Tribunal and that Form No.10 was also

issued thereon.   On the demise of the petitioner's father, the

name of the petitioner is not being reflected in the revenue

records in respect of the land in question.


</p><p id="p_3">      3.    Heard Sri Neelakantappa K. Pujar, the learned

counsel for the petitioner and Sri Kiran Kumar T.L., the learned

Additional Government Advocate appearing for the respondent.


</p><p id="p_4">      4.    The Tahsildar has not at all examined whether the

petitioner is entitled to get the khatha in his name in respect of

the land in question. He has issued a quixotic endorsement to

the effect that as the name of the Government is shown in the

revenue records, the petitioner has to file an appeal before the

competent authority.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                   3</span><p id="p_5">



</p><p id="p_6">      5.    The      impugned   endorsement   is   quashed.   The

Tahsildar is directed to scrutinize the documents filed by the

petitioner in support of his case that he is entitled to have his

name entered in the revenue records. It is thereafter that the

Tahsildar has to either accept the request of the petitioner or

turn it down. This exercise shall be completed in accordance with

law and as expeditiously as possible and in any case within two

months from the date of the production of the certified copy of

today's order.    It is made clear that no opinion whatsoever is

expressed on the merits of the claims of the petitioner. Needless

to observe that all the persons interested in the land in question

are required to be put on notice.
</p>
<p id="p_7">
</p><p id="p_8">      6.    If the respondent rejects the petitioner's request, it

is always open to the petitioner to file an appeal.


</p><p id="p_9">      7.    These petitions are accordingly disposed of.       No

order as to costs.
