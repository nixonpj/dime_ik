                      the respective region were requested to verify the watchers and

                      regularising their services in the regular time scale of pay.

                             Court in the said order dated 01.12.2016, had repulsed
                             and over ruled such argument stating that the petitioner
                             therein was entitled to regularization on completion of ten
                             years of service from the date of his initial appointment.

                      others, who are eligible for such conferment of benefits under the

                      G.O.22 dated 28.02.2006, it does not lie in the mouth of the

                      respondent department to take a different stand that the petitioner has

                      not completed 10 years of service as on 01.01.2006. As rightly

                      contended by the petitioner, the issue of regularisation of the

                      employees employed in the Forest Department in the State of Tamil

                      Nadu is no more res integra for the reason that the decision passed by

                      this Court has been confirmed in the Appeal and against which, a

                      review was filed and the review was also rejected and therefore, the

                      issue of regularisation has come a full circle and in the light of the

                      decisions as aforementioned, the respondents cannot have any

                      objections for regularisation of the petitioner herein as well.

<p id="p_34">                                10.Once the Department has extracted work from the petitioner

                      from more than 21 years, it is opposed to fair play, equity and good

                      conscience to deny the regularisation only on the specious ground that

                      he was appointed in 1997 and has not completed 10 yeas of service as

                      on 01.01.2006, he was not employed through Employment Exchange.
</p>
<p id="p_35">                      Such ground is no more open to the Department to urge in view of the

                      orders passed by this Court overruling such objections. The other

                      objections raised by the Department in regard to non-completion of 10

                      years is also without any substance or basis, since the 2nd respondent

                      himself has recommended the case for regularisation as far as the

                      petitioner herein is concerned along with others in terms of G.O.22, P

                      &amp; AR Department, dated 28.02.2006. Therefore, this Court is of the

                      view that in all fours, the petitioner has made out a case for grant of

                      relief.
