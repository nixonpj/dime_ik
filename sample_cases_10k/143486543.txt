        W. P. No. 1291 (W) of 2011


                          Mr. Somnath Bose,
                          Mr. Mohini Mohan Mukhopadhyay
                                           .. For the Petitioner.


                          The petitioner, who was an Assistant Teacher of Sukchar Karmadaksha Chandradhur Vidyayatan
      (H.S.) in the district of 24-Parganas (North), retired from service on superannuation on 31st October, 2010. Since the
      retiral dues of the petitioner has not been paid, the petitioner has come before this court with this writ petition seeking
      appropriate relief so that his retiral benefits are released forthwith.


                          It appears from the letter dated 8th April, 2008 written by the District Inspector of Schools (S.E.),
      Barrackpore, North 24-Parganas addressed to the Administrator of the said school being Annexure "P-10" to this writ
      petition at page 36 that the retiral dues of the petitioner could not be settled as the concerned District Inspector of
      Schools was of the view that the petitioner was not entitled to get the benefit of M. A. scale in view of the office
      memorandum dated 14th March, 2008 as he did not improve his qualification after taking approval of the concerned
      District Inspector of Schools. Thus, the concerned District Inspector of Schools was of the view that the excess
      payment which the petitioner received during the tenure of his service should be recovered from the petitioner before
      settlement of the retiral benefits of the petitioner.


                          Let me consider as to how far the said stand taken by the concerned District Inspector of Schools
      can be sustained in the light of the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of <a href="/doc/115941997/" id="a_1">Shambabu vs. Union of India
      &amp; Others</a> reported in 1994 Vol.-II S.C.C. 521. It was held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the said decision that if a
      retired person had no hand either in the process refixation of his/her pay or further payment, the overdrawn amount
      cannot be adjusted and/or realized from the retiral benefits of such retired person after his/her retirement.


                          It is not the case where the State Government alleges that such refixation was made at a higher slab
      due to fraudulent misrepresentation made by the petitioner. As such, this court holds that the petitioner was not at fault
      in the process of refixation of his pay scale during the tenure of his service. Thus, this court by relying upon the
      aforesaid decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court, holds that if any amount is found to have been paid to the petitioner
      in excess of his entitlement during the tenure of his service due to wrong pay fixation by the concerned authority, State
      respondents are neither entitled to adjust such overdrawn amount against the retiral benefits of the petitioner nor the</pre>
<p id="p_1">      said overdrawn amount can be realized from the retiral benefits of the petitioner.
</p>

<p id="p_2">                          Under such circumstances, this court disposes of this writ petition by directing the concerned
      authority to complete the entire exercise regarding release of the petitioner's retiral benefits within eight weeks from
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                                               2</span>

the date of communication of this order by taking note of his last drawn salary but without deducting the overdrawn
amount, if there be any, from the retiral benefits of the petitioner.
</p>

<p id="p_3">                   Under such circumstances, the impugned communication dated 8th April, 2008 made by the District
Inspector of Schools (S.E.), Barrackpore, North 24-Parganas to the Administrator of the said school being Annexure "
P-10" to this writ petition at page 36, stands quashed.
</p>

<p id="p_4">                   The concerned District Inspector of Schools is, thus, directed to complete the entire process in the
manner as indicated above.
</p>

<p id="p_5">                   The writ petition, thus, stands disposed of.
</p>

<p id="p_6">                   Urgent xerox certified copy of this order, if applied for, be supplied to the learned advocate for the
petitioner as early as possible.
