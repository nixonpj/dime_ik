</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">         2.       On admitted facts, at the time of death of his
         father in harness on 08.06.1985 the petitioner was aged
         about one year.       Compassionate appointment to a minor
         dependant unless the rules so provide cannot be granted
         [refer "<a href="/doc/1995967/" id="a_1">National Institute of Technology &amp; Ors. vs. Niraj
         Kumar Singh</a>" reported in (2007) 2 SCC 481]. Even
         otherwise     also    stand    taken     by    the   petitioner   for
         appointment      on    compassionate          ground   cannot     be
         countenanced in law.</blockquote>
<p id="p_20">         3.       After death of his father on 08.06.1985, his elder
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                               2</span>

brother submitted an application on 10.01.1986 for his
appointment on the compassionate ground. It appears that
his claim for compassionate appointment was rejected by
the Compassionate Appointment Committee, Garhwa in its
meeting held on 19.06.1996. His brother has chosen not
to challenge rejection of his claim for compassionate
appointment.    Sixteen years thereafter the petitioner has
come to this Court seeking compassionate appointment in
place of his elder brother who according to him has
crossed 42 years of age and, thus, not eligible for
appointment in Government service. Not only the petitioner
was not eligible for appointment at the time of death of his
father and his application is highly belated, on the
aforesaid stand that his elder brother now has become
ineligible for appointment and, therefore, he should be
granted appointment, no direction for his compassionate
appointment can be issued by the Court. After all, object
behind compassionate appointment which is an exception
to the constitutional mandate under <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_2">Article 14</a> and <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_3">16</a> is to
provide help to the family in distress.     About a quarter
century after the petitioner's father died in harness the
petitioner cannot take a stand that the family has not
weathered the bad weather.
</p><p id="p_21">4.       In the above facts, finding no ground to interfere
in the matter the writ petition is dismissed.
