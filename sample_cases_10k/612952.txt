                        P.n.Mohanty (for Opp.party No.2).
B. N. MAHAPATRA, J.                This writ petition has been filed challenging the office
</pre><p id="p_3">order dated 27.07.2006 (Annexure-4) passed by the Managing Director, Orissa State
Handloom Weavers' Co-operative Society Ltd (for short "the Society") by which the
opposite party No.1-Managing Director of the Society accepted the petitioner's
application dated 14.07.2006 for voluntary retirement and allowed him to retire w.e.f.
31.07.2006 and relieved him from service from that date.
</p><p id="p_4">2.       The facts and circumstances giving rise to the present writ petition are that the
petitioner on being selected, joined the Society as Junior Clerk on 08.03.1984 as per
Annexure-A series to Additional Counter affidavit filed by O.P. No.1 (but the date of joining
as stated by the petitioner in the writ petition, i.e., "08.03.2006" seems to be incorrect).
Opposite party No.1-Managing Director on 30.06.2006 on the bases of decision of the
Board of the Management vide resolution dated 09.06.2006 and the Government of
Orissa P.E. Department letter No. 2059 dated 08.06.2006 issued notice under Annexure-
1 inviting applications from the eligible employees of the society for voluntary retirement
under the Voluntary Retirement Scheme (for short "the Scheme"). On 14.07.2006, the
petitioner tendered his application for voluntary retirement under the Scheme. Thereafter
on 17.07.2006, he made an application (Annexure-2) to the opposite party No.1-
Managing Director for withdrawal of his application for voluntary retirement as he was left
with 12 years of service. Again on 24.07.2006, the petitioner sent another application
(Annexure-3) to opposite party No.1-Managing Director by speed post requesting him to
allow the application dated 17.07.2006 (Annexure-2) filed by petitioner for withdrawal of
the application dated 14.07.2006 under the Scheme. However, the opposite party No.1
accepted the petitioner's application for voluntary retirement on 27.07.2006 and allowed
the petitioner to retire from service w.e.f. 31.07.2006 and relieved him from service vide
Annexure-4. Hence, this writ petition.
</p><p id="p_5">3.       Mr. Suresh Chandra Mishra, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the
petitioner, vehemently argued that the office order dated 27.07.2006 passed under
Annexure-4 asking the petitioner to retire from 31.07.2006 A.N. upon consideration of
the petitioner's application dated 14.07.2006 for voluntary retirement ignoring his
applications dated 17.07.2006 (Annexure-2) and 23.07.2006 (Annexure-3) filed for
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                              2</span>



withdrawal of the application dated 14.07.2006 being contrary to law is unsustainable.
According to Mr. Mishra, the petitioner applied for withdrawal of his application made for
voluntary retirement before the same was accepted on 27.07.2007. Thus, the
application of the petitioner for voluntary retirement was accepted by the time the same
had lost its existence in the eye of law.
</p><p id="p_6">          In absence of any legal, contractual or constitutional bar, an application for
voluntary retirement can be withdrawn at any time before the same is made effective. In
support of his contention, Mr. Mishra relied on the decision of the Apex Court in <a href="/doc/416821/" id="a_2">Food
Corporation of Indian &amp; Others vs. Ramesh Kumar</a>, AIR 2007 SC 2864 and the
decision of this Court in <a href="/doc/339465/" id="a_3">M.S.P. Dora vs. Orissa State Road Transport Corporation
&amp; Others</a>, 2006 (I) OLR 240.
</p><p id="p_7">          It is further submitted that even though the petitioner was willing and ready to
work, he was illegally not allowed to do so. Therefore, the petitioner may be treated to
be in service all along entitling him to all the service and financial benefits.
</p><p id="p_8">4.        Mr. Biswajit Jena, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the opposite party
No.1, per contra, vehemently contended that the Society is an apex Co-operative
Society. Its primary object is to improve socio-economic conditions of the poor weavers
in the State. Due to large scale closure of unviable sale depots of the Society more
than 100 employees became surplus and the society was not in a position to take the
liability of their salaries and to make the Society viable. A restructuring proposal was
formulated, which was approved by the State Government as well as by the
Development Commissioner of Handloom, Government of India. Accordingly, the
Scheme for voluntary retirement was floated and applications were invited from the
interested employees to take voluntary retirement as per Annexure-1. Pursuant to the
notice under Annexure-1, the petitioner applied for voluntary retirement, which was duly
considered and accepted by the opposite parties. At no point of time the petitioner was
compelled to take voluntary retirement nor he was relieved forcibly. The post held by the
petitioner, after his retirement, has already been abolished. The jural relationship
between the present petitioner and the society came to an end immediately after the
decision was taken for acceptance of his voluntary retirement and transmission of his
offer for voluntary retirement to the opposite party No.2 for providing fund. Prior to
receipt of his application for withdrawal, a decision was taken to relieve him from service
and to sponsor petitioner's name to opposite party No.2 for sanction and release of
funds in his favour towards the claim for voluntary retirement. The authorities after
scrutinizing all the applications under the Scheme on 17.07.2006 vide letter No. 1422
dated 20.07.2006 (Annexure-A series) recommended the case of 69 employees to
Public Enterprises Department for sanction of funds. On 21.07.2006, the withdrawal
application was rejected. On the same day, the opposite party No.1-Managing Director,
vide his order No. 1457(26) dated 21.07.2006 directed the applicant to handover the
charge to Sri A.K. Sahoo, L.A. by 27.07.2006 (Annexure-C). Under the Notification
fifteen days' time was allowed to the employees to submit their voluntary retirement
applications and another fifteen days time was granted to the authorities to work out the
Scheme in order to relieve the employees from their respective posts with effect from
31.07.2006. If within this specified time the applications would not have been
considered by the authorities then it could not have been possible on the part of the
authorities to work out the Scheme and the whole calculation of the authorities would
have fallen down. Hence, there was no scope for the authorities to consider any
application after 15.07.2006. In support of his contention, Mr. Jena relied upon the
decision of the apex Court in <a href="/doc/589350/" id="a_4">State Bank of Patiala v. Romesh Chander Kanoji and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                                3</span>



Ors</a>., (2004) 2 SCC 651. Relying on a decision of this Court in Ganesh Chandra Samal
v. Addl. Registrar, Co-operative Societies-cum-Managing Director, OMFED,
Bhubaneswar and another, 2006 (Supp. II) OLR 226, Mr. Jena contended that the
opp. party-Society does not come within the category of a co-operative society which
can acquire the status of a 'State' or local or other authority and, therefore, is not
amenable to writ jurisdiction.
</p><p id="p_9">5.       In the rejoinder, the petitioner has stated that the action of the opposite parties is
contrary to the conditions enumerated in the Scheme. The contention of the opposite
parties that withdrawal application of the petitioner for voluntary retirement was received
after the decision was taken by the opposite party No.1-Managing Director is not
tenable since the date on which such decision was taken is neither mentioned in the
counter nor any supporting document has been annexed to that effect. The withdrawal
application was received by the opposite parties before the sanction order was passed
and communicated to the petitioner.
</p><p id="p_10">6.       At this juncture, it is felt necessary to reproduce here some of the relevant
paragraphs of the Notification dated 30.06.2006 (Annexure-1) and paragraph-9(i) of the
Scheme (Annexure-5):
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">         Notification dated 30.06.2006
                 "The employees who are interested to retire under this Voluntary
       Retirement Scheme may apply to the Competent Authority in the prescribed
       format. The application shall be submitted before the Competent Authority on or
       before 15th July, 2006. After due scrutiny of the applications so received the
       employees found eligible shall be relieved from their respective service with effect
       from 31st July 2006".
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">                   Voluntary Retirement Scheme (Annexure-5)
       "9. General Conditions:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">       The following conditions shall also apply to avail the benefit under this Scheme:
</blockquote>
<p id="p_11">(i)    Application for Voluntary Retirement cannot be withdrawn after sanction order to
       this effect is communicated to the concerned employee."
</p><p id="p_12">7.      In order to appreciate the rival contentions, it will be appropriate to refer to some
of the decisions of the apex Court and this court.
</p><p id="p_13">        In Food Corporation of India (supra), the apex Court held that if the incumbent
withdraws his offer within the time limit fixed for revocation, then the offer given by the
incumbent cannot be treated against him and it will be deemed that he has revoked the
offer.
</p><p id="p_14">        The Hon'ble Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/1962388/" id="a_5">Balram Gupta V. Union of India &amp; Anr</a>. 1988 SCC
(L &amp; S) 126, held that notice of voluntary retirement can be withdrawn at any time before a
retirement becomes effective. In that case, the appellant after completing more than 20 years'
government service, offered by his letter dated December 24, 1980 to retire voluntarily from
service w.e.f. March 31, 1981 by treating the notice period w.e.f. January 1, 1981. The
respondent-Government by its letter dated January 20, 1981 allowed the appellant to do so.
However, in the meantime, the appellant stated that on account of persistent and personal
requests from the staff members, he had to change his mind and accordingly by his letter
dated January 31, 1981 he sought to withdraw his notice of voluntary retirement. But the
authority concerned disallowed the appellant's request under Rule 48-A (4) of the Central
Civil Services (Pension) Rules which precludes a government servant from withdrawing his
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                                  4</span>



notice "except with the specific approval of such authority". Allowing the appeal with costs the
Hon'ble Supreme Court held that there was no valid reason for withholding the permission by
the respondent. Therefore, the appellant was entitled to be put back to his job with all the
consequential benefits treating him to be in the job from March 31, 1981. The retirement from
the government service was to take effect at a subsequent date prospectively and that the
withdrawal was long before that date. Therefore, the appellant had locus poenitentiae. The
dissolution of the contract of employment would be brought about only on the date indicated
i.e. March 31, 1981 and up to that, the appellant was and is a government employee. There is
no unilateral termination of the same prior thereto. Being a government servant, he is at
liberty and entitled independently without adhering to sub-rule (4) of Rule 48-A of the Pension
Rules, to withdraw his notice of voluntary retirement. In this respect, it stands at par with letter
of resignation.
</p><p id="p_15">         In Punjab National Bank Vs. P.K. Mittal, AIR 1989 SC 1083, the Hon'ble
Supreme Court again examined the case wherein the employee tendered his resignation
on 21.01.1986 to be effective on 30.06.1986. The resignation was accepted on
07.02.1986 pointing out that it had been accepted by the Authority with immediate effect.
The Apex Court held that the Authority had no competence to advance the date of its
effectiveness and resignation, if accepted, it could have become effective only on
30.06.1986 and as the resignation was to be effective with future date, the employee
had a right to withdraw the same prior to 30.06.1986.
</p><p id="p_16">The Apex Court in <a href="/doc/882187/" id="a_6">J.N.Srivastava V. Union of India &amp; Ors</a>., (1998) 9 SCC 559, held
that it is well settled that even if the voluntary retirement notice is moved by an
employee and gets accepted by the authority within the time fixed, before the date of
retirement is reached, the employee has locus poenitentiae to withdraw the proposal
for voluntary retirement.
</p><p id="p_17">                  The Hon'ble Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/1872028/" id="a_7">Shambhu Murari Sinha v. Project &amp;
Development India &amp; Anr</a>., (2000) 5 SCC 621, held as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_4">        "From the facts stated above, it would be seen that though the option of
        voluntary retirement exercised by the appellant by his letter dated 18-10-1995
        was accepted by the respondent-Management by their letter dated 30-7-1997,
        the appellant was not relieved from service and he was allowed to continue in
        service till 26-9-1997, which, for all practical purposes, would be the "effective
        date" as it was on this date that he was relieved from service. In the meantime,
        as pointed out above, the appellant had already withdrawn the offer of voluntary
        retirement vide his letter dated 7-8-1997. The question which, therefore, arises in
        this appeal is whether it is open to a person having exercised option of voluntary
        retirement to withdraw the said offer after its acceptance but before it is made
        effective. The question is squarely answered by three decisions, namely, <a href="/doc/1962388/" id="a_8">Balram
        Gupta v. Union of India</a>, <a href="/doc/882187/" id="a_9">J.N. Srivastava v. Union of India</a> and <a href="/doc/81701/" id="a_10">Power Finance
        Corpn. Ltd. v. Pramod Kumar Bhatia</a> in which it was held that the resignation, in
        spite of its acceptance, can be withdrawn before the "effective date". That being
        so, the appeal is allowed. The impugned judgment of the High Court is set aside
        with the direction that the appellant shall be allowed to continue in service with
        all consequential benefits."</blockquote>
<p id="p_18">       The apex Court in <a href="/doc/94549311/" id="a_11">F.C.I. and others v. Romesh Kumar</a> (supra) held that if the
revocation is made within the time limit fixed for revocation, then the offer given by
incumbent cannot be treated against him and it will be deemed that he had revoked the
offer.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                              5</span>



<p id="p_19">        This Court in M.S.P.Dora Vs. Orissa State Road Transport Corporation
represented by its Chairman-cum-Managing Director &amp; others, 2006(1) OLR-240,
held that the petitioner has every right to withdraw the application for voluntary
retirement anytime before the jural relationship between him and his employer got
severed.
</p><p id="p_20">        In Prasanna Kumar Pani -v- State of Orissa and others in W.P.(C) No.16506
of 2008 (disposed of on 17.07.2009), this Court held that the incumbent has locus
standi to withdraw his proposal for voluntary retirement before the date for voluntary
retirement is reached.
</p><p id="p_21">8.      In the present case, as stated above, there is a specific provision for withdrawal
of the offer for voluntary retirement. According to Clause 9(i) of the Scheme, application
for voluntary retirement cannot be withdrawn after the sanction order to this effect is
communicated to the employee concerned. Admittedly, in the instant case, the
application dated 14.7.2006 for voluntary retirement has been withdrawn by the
petitioner on 17.7.2006 by which date no sanction order was communicated to the
concerned employee as required under clause 9(i) of the Scheme.
</p><p id="p_22">        In paragraph-9 of the counter affidavit, the opposite parties averred that prior to
receipt of the application for withdrawal, decision was taken to relieve the petitioner from
service and to sponsor his name to opposite party No.2 for sanction and release of the
funds towards his VRS claim. Unfortunately, Para-9 of the counter affidavit does not
reveal the date on which the application for withdrawal of the voluntary retirement was
received by the opposite parties and the date on which the decision was taken to relieve
the petitioner from service and the date on which his name was sponsored to opposite
party No.2 for sanction and release of funds towards VRS.
</p><p id="p_23">        Perusal of Annexure-A annexed to additional counter affidavit dated 16.07.2009
nowhere reveals that on 17.07.2006 the authorities scrutinized all the VRS applications.
In course of hearing, learned counsel appearing for the opposite parties has also not
brought to the notice of the Court either from Annexure-A or from any other document
that the authorities have scrutinized all the VRS applications on 17.07.2006 as stated in
para-3 of the additional counter affidavit dated 16.07.2009. On the other hand,
Annexure-B attached to the additional affidavit dated 16.07.2009 filed by opposite party
No.1 reveals that the withdrawal application of the petitioner dated 17.07.2006 was put
up before the Secretary on 18.07.2006. The Secretary put up the same before the
opposite party No.1 on 19.07.2006, which was rejected by opposite party No.1 on
21.07.2006. This fact has been clearly admitted in paragraph-4 of the additional counter
affidavit.
</p><p id="p_24">        Annexure-C reveals that the date mentioned in the said order has been
overwritten. This casts clouds of suspicion in our mind about the actual date on which
such notice was issued.
</p><p id="p_25">        In any event, fact remains that the application dated 14.07.2006 for voluntary
retirement has been withdrawn by the petitioner on 17.07.2006 by which date no
sanction order was communicated to the employee concerned as required under Clause
9(i) of the Scheme. Therefore, the action of the opposite parties in accepting the
petitioner's application for voluntary retirement ignoring his application for withdrawal of
the same is unsustainable.
</p><p id="p_26">9.      The decision cited by Mr. Jena, learned counsel for the opp. parties is of no help
to the opp. parties. In State Bank of Patiala (supra), the apex Court held that since the
schemes in question are funded schemes, the management is required to create a fund.
The creation of the fund would depend upon the number of application; the cost of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                                6</span>



Scheme; liability which the Scheme would impose on the Bank and such other variable
factors. If the employees are allowed to withdraw from the Scheme at any time after its
closure, it would not be possible to work out the Scheme as all calculations of the
management would fail. SBPVRS is an invitation to offer and not an offer. Therefore,
clause (5) of SBPVRS gives locus poeniteniae to the employee to withdraw by 1.3.2001
after which the mode of acceptance contemplated by clause (8) of SBPVRS would apply
and the Bank will proceed to vet the applications. Reading clauses (5), (8) and (9)(i), it is
clear that employees are precluded from withdrawing from SBPVRS after the closure of
the Scheme on 1.3.2001.
</p><p id="p_27">         As stated above, the petitioner has withdrawn his application for voluntary
retirement within the time prescribed in the Scheme itself. Therefore, this decision of the
apex Court on the other hand supports the case of the petitioner.
</p><p id="p_28">10.      In Ganesh Chandra Samal (supra), the issue was whether Opposite Party no.1
though a Cooperative Society is amenable to writ jurisdiction being not a State or authority
within the meaning of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_12">Article 12</a> of the Constitution. In that case this Court held that merely
because a definite sum has been provided by the State Government either as subsidy or
grant that does not make the functioning of the Society run and control by the State, and,
therefore, opposite party no.1, though a Co-operative Society is not amenable to writ
jurisdictions.
</p><p id="p_29">         In the instant case neither in the counter affidavit dated 15.11.2006 nor in the
additional affidavit dated 16.7.2009 any such stand/plea has been taken by the opposite
parties much less any supporting material to that effect with regard to the maintainability of
the writ petition.
</p><p id="p_30">         Law is well settled that a party has to plead the case and produce/adduce
sufficient evidence to substantiate his stand taken in the petition and, in case the
pleadings are not complete, the Court is under no obligation to entertain the plea. In
Bharat Singh &amp; Ors.Vs.State of Haryana &amp; Ors, AIR 1988 S.C.2181, the Supreme
Court has observed as under:-
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_5">       "In our opinion, when a point, which is ostensibly a point of law is required to be
       substantiated by facts, the party raising the point, if he is the writ petitioner, must
       plead and prove such facts by evidence which must appear from the writ petition
       and if he is the respondent, from the counter affidavit. If the facts are not pleaded
       or the evidence in support of such facts is not annexed to the writ petition or to the
       counter-affidavit, as the case may be, the Court will not entertain the point. There
       is a distinction between a hearing under the Code of Civil Procedure and a writ
       petition or a counter affidavit. While in a pleading, i.e. a plaint or written statement,
       the facts and not evidence are required to be pleaded, in a writ petition or in the
       counter affidavit not only the facts but also the evidence in proof of such facts
       have to be pleaded and annexed to it."
</blockquote><p id="p_31">11.     In view of the above, we have no hesitation to hold that the action of the opposite
parties in accepting the petitioner's application for voluntary retirement ignoring his
application for withdrawal of the same being not in conformity with the provisions of the
Scheme is unsustainable. The petitioner was deemed to have been in service all along
during the period in question. The opposite parties-authorities will have to make good to
the petitioner with all pecuniary benefits by treating him to be in continuous service for
the period in question as the petitioner is always ready and willing to work though he
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                                 7</span>



was illegally relieved from service with effect from 31.7.2006 (Annexure-4) for no fault of
him. The petitioner is entitled to get all arrear salary, other emoluments including
increment and pecuniary benefits. Our above view gets support from the decision of the
Hon'ble Supreme Court in Srikantha S.M.V.Bharath Earth Movers Ltd, (2005) 8 SCC
314, wherein it is held as under:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_6">                 "The next question is, as to what benefits the appellant is entitled to. As he
        withdrew the resignation and yet he was not allowed to work, he is entitled to all
        consequential benefits. The learned counsel for the respondent Company no doubt
        contended that after 15.01.1993, the appellant had not actually worked and therefore,
        even if this Court holds that the action of the respondent Company was not in
        consonance with law, at the most, the appellant might be entitled to other benefits
        except the salary which should have been paid to him. According to the counsel, the
        principle of "no work, no pay" would apply and when the appellant has admittedly not
        worked, he cannot claim salary for the said period.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_7">                 29. We must frankly admit that we are unable to uphold the contention of the
        respondent Company. A similar situation had arisen in J.N.Srivastava and a similar
        argument was advanced by the employer. The Court, however, negatived the
        argument observing that when the workman was willing to work but the employer did
        not allow him to work, it would not be open to the employer to deny monetary benefits
        to the workman who was not permitted to discharge his duties. Accordingly, the
        benefits were granted to him. In Shambhu Murari Sinha II also, this Court held that
        since the relationship of employer and employee continued till the employee attained
        the age of superannuation he would be entitled to "full salary and allowances" of the
        entire period he was kept out of service. In Balram Gupta in spite of specific provision
        precluding the government servant from withdrawing notice of retirement, this Court
        granted all consequential benefits to him. The appellant is, therefore, entitled to salary
        and other benefits."
</blockquote><p id="p_32">12.     In that view of the matter, we quash the order dated 27.7.2006 (Annexure-4)
passed by opposite party no.1 so far as the petitioner is concerned, and direct the
opposite parties to give effect to this judgment within a period of three months from the
date of receipt of a copy of this judgment.
</p><p id="p_33">             In the result, the writ petition is allowed. No costs.

<p id="p_34">                                                            Writ petition allowed.
