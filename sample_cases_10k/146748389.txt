             (SUYASH RAGHUVANSHI Vs THE STATE OF MADHYA PRADESH)


12-05-2017

Shri Anurag Gohil, counsel for the petitioner.
Shri D.K. Paroha, panel lawyer for the respondent State.</pre>
<p id="p_1">Heard on this Second application for bail under <a href="/doc/1290514/" id="a_1">Section 439</a>
of the Cr.P.C. filed on behalf of the petitioner Suyash
Rahuvanshi in Crime No.659/2016, registered by P.S.- Bag
Sevania, District- Bhopal under <a href="/doc/1279834/" id="a_2">Sections 376</a> and <a href="/doc/180217/" id="a_3">506</a> of the
IPC and Sections 3, 4, 5 &amp; 6 of the POCSO Act, 2012.
The first application for bail under <a href="/doc/1290514/" id="a_4">Section 439</a> of the Cr.P.C.
filed on behalf of the petitioner Suyash Raghuvanshi was
dismissed by this Court by order dated 30.03.2017 with the
observations that the petitioner shall be free to renew his
prayer after recording of the statements of the material
witnesses before the trial Court.
</p><p id="p_2">Since there are no other eye witnesses in the case; therefore,
the prosecutrix alone is material witness herein.
Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the
statements of the prosecutrix before the trial Court has been
recorded on 11.04.2017 and she has turned totally hostile and
has not supported the prosecution case. She has categorically
denied that the petitioner Suyash Raghuvanshi raped her.
She has stated that she had lodged the report of rape against
the petitioner because she wanted the police to take action
against him, who is also her step father.
</p><p id="p_3">Learned panel lawyer for the respondent State on the other
hand has opposed the bail application mainly on the ground
that the statements of the prosecution witnesses before the
 Court cannot be pressed into service for the purpose of
granting bail.
</p><p id="p_4">It is true that it has been held by the Supreme Court in the
case of Satish Jaggi Vs. State of Chattisgarh, 2007 Cr.L.J.
2766 that the testimony of the prosecution witnesses cannot
be appreciated for the purpose of grant of bail; however, this
is not a case of appreciation of the prosecution evidence but it
is a case of total lack of evidence against the petitioner.
In view of the statements of the prosecutrix, in the opinion of
this Court, it would be futile to keep the petitioner behind the
bars for the entire duration of the trial.
Consequently, this Second application for bail under
<a href="/doc/1290514/" id="a_5">Section 439</a> of the Cr.P.C. filed on behalf of the petitioner
Suyash Rahuvanshi is allowed.
</p><p id="p_5">It is directed that the petitioner shall be released on bail on
furnishing a personal bond in the sum of Rs.40,000/- with a
solvent surety in the same amount to the satisfaction of the
trial Court for his appearance before that Court on all dates
fixed in the case and for complying with the conditions
enumerated under <a href="/doc/848468/" id="a_6">Section 437</a> (3) of the <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_7">Cr.P.C</a>.
Certified copy as per rules.
