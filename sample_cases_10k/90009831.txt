(By Shri.M.K.Soudagar, Advocate for R2,
    R1 sd)

     This appeal is filed under Section 173 (1) of the
M.V.Act, against the judgment and award dated
02.11.2009 passed in MVC No.2913/2006 on the file of
the Fast Track at Athani, partly allowing the claim petition
for   compensation    and     seeking    enhancement       of
compensation.
                              :2:


     This appeal coming on for admission, this day, the
Court delivered the following: -

                        JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">     This appeal is filed against the judgment and award

passed by the learned Presiding Officer, Fast Track Court,

Athani, in M.V.C.No.2913/2006 whereby the learned

Presiding    Officer   has   awarded   compensation     of

Rs.1,41,000/- on account of the injuries sustained by the

appellant in a motor vehicle accident. Not being satisfied

with the quantum of compensation passed by the

Tribunal, the appellant has filed this appeal seeking

enhancement of compensation.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">2.   It is the case of the appellant that on 14.10.2006 at

about 5.30 p.m. appellant and one Bhimappa Bilur were

waiting for the bus at the side of the Athani-Bijapur road

near Burli Petrol Pump.      At that time, a motor cycle

bearing registration No.KA-23 R 8799 being driven by its

rider in a rash and negligent manner dashed against the

appellant.    Due to the impact, appellant sustained

grievous injuries and immediately he was taken to the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                              :3:</span>


hospital of Dr.Sudhir Shah at Miraj where he was

admitted as an inpatient for one month.         The appellant

spent     Rs.70,000/-   towards    medical   expenses      and

incidental charges. Accordingly, he filed a claim petition

in M.V.C.No.2913/2006 before the Fast Track Court at

Athani,    wherein   the   Tribunal   awarded    a   sum    of

Rs.1,41,000/- to the appellant.
</p>
<p id="p_4">
</p><p id="p_5">3.      Learned counsel for the appellant submits that the

appellant owns 8 acres of agricultural lands and he was

personally cultivating the lands but the Tribunal has

taken only Rs.3,000/- towards his monthly income and

after considering the disability at 10% as per the medical

evidence, awarded only a sum of Rs.58,000/- towards loss

of future income which requires enhancement. He further

submits that the Tribunal ought to have taken the income

of the appellant at Rs.10,000/- per month as he was

earning more than Rs.1 lakh per month and that the

award passed by the Tribunal under different heads is

also inadequate.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                             :4:</span><p id="p_6">


</p><p id="p_7">4.   Per contra, learned counsel for the Insurance

Company submitted that the award passed by the

Tribunal is just and reasonable and that having regard to

the nature of the injuries sustained by the appellant, there

is no ground to enhance the compensation.


</p><p id="p_8">5.   The manner of the accident and the injuries

sustained by the appellant are not denied. As seen from

the records, the appellant has produced RTC though not

marked before the Tribunal. The appellant was owning 8

acres of land in R.S.No.259 and personally cultivating his

land. On account of the injuries sustained, he is disabled

and he has to engage some other person to cultivate the

land by paying wages. Therefore, considering the age and

the land owned by the appellant, it is just and reasonable

to fix the income of the appellant at Rs.4,500/- per month.

As per the medical evidence, the percentage of disability

sustained by the appellant is 10%. As per the decision of

the Apex Court in the case of SARLA VERMA VS. DELHI

TRANSPORT      CORPORATION,       the   relevant   multiplier

applicable is 17 whereas the Tribunal has applied 16.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                              :5:</span>


Therefore, by applying the multiplier of 17 and taking into

consideration the income of the appellant at Rs.4,500/-

p.m.,     the   loss   of   earning   capacity   comes   to

Rs.4500X12X17X10%=Rs.91,800/-.
</p>
<p id="p_9">
</p><p id="p_10">6.      The Tribunal has awarded only Rs.25,000/- towards

pain and agony which appears to be on the lower side as

the appellant sustained fractural injuries and undergone

treatment for a considerable time. Hence, the appellant is

entitled for Rs.35,000/- towards pain and suffering.


</p><p id="p_11">7.      The Tribunal has taken the laid up period as six

months and awarded compensation of Rs.18,000/- by

taking the monthly income at the rate of Rs.3,000/- p.m.

Now as the income of the deceased is taken as Rs.4,500/-

p.m., it is just and necessary to award an amount of

Rs.13,500/- taking the period of treatment as three

months.
</p>
<p id="p_12">
</p><p id="p_13">8.      For the foregoing reasons, the appeal filed by the

appellant is allowed in part and the impugned judgment

and award dated 02.11.2009 in M.V.C.No.2913/2006
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                             :6:</span>


passed by the Fast Track at Athani, is hereby modified by

awarding Rs.1,80,300/-with interest at the rate of 6% p.a.

as against Rs.1,41,000/- awarded by the Tribunal.


</p><p id="p_14">       The 2nd respondent-Insurance Company is directed

to deposit the enhanced compensation amount with

interest at 6% p.a. within three months from the date of

receipt of copy of this judgment and award.

</p><p id="p_15">       The entire enhanced amount with interest shall be

released in favour of the appellant soon after the deposit.

</p><p id="p_16">       Office to draw the award accordingly.
</p>
<p id="p_17">

</p><p id="p_18">                                          (Sd/-)
                                         JUDGE
