                      Commissioner of Income Tax (Central) - III, Kolkata



Before:
The Hon'ble Justice I. P. MUKERJI
            And
The Hon'ble Justice AMRITA SINHA
Date: 27th June 2018

                                                              Appearance:
                                          Mr. J. P. Khaitan, Sr. Advocate
                                                     Ms. S. Roy, Advocate
                                                         for the appellant
                                             Mr. Ranjan Sinha, Advocate
                                                      for the respondent</pre>

<p id="p_1">      The Court: This is a section 260A appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_2">      The question involved is whether the Tribunal exercised its

discretion correctly under <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_1">Section 158BFA(2)</a> of the Income Tax Act,

1961 in imposing a penalty of Rs.10 lakhs on the assessee? The reasons

of the Tribunal are to be found in paragraphs 16, 17 and 18 of its order

dated 19th January 2007.
</p>
<p id="p_3">      The only ground on which it has justified imposition of this penalty

is the alleged delay of 13 months on the part of the assessee to disclose

the income after the search and seizure operation.

</p><p id="p_4">      There are two reasons why this order of the Tribunal cannot be

supported. On 1st October 2004, a letter was written on behalf of the

assessee to the Assistant Commissioner of Income Tax recording that

photocopies of the seized documents of the whole Kundu group were

recently taken. On 14th December 2004 the assessee filed their return

showing the increased income.
</p>
<p id="p_5">      We do not think that this aspersion of "13 months delay" was

correct. Moreover, the initial imposition of penalty by the Assessing
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                         2</span>


Officer was reversed by the Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals), on

appeal, on 31st August 2005. The Commissioner (Appeals) came to the

specific finding that there was no mala fide conduct on the part of the

assessee in disclosing this additional income. This finding of fact should

not have been so ordinarily interfered with by the Tribunbal on appeal.

There had to be strong factual basis available to the Tribunal to do so.

</p><p id="p_6">          The Tribunal failed to appreciate that the imposition of penalty was

discretionary and that this discretion had to be judiciously used as held

by a Division Bench of the Bombay High Court in <a href="/doc/1911899/" id="a_2">Commissioner of

Income-Tax v. Dodsal Ltd</a>. reported in (2009) 312 ITR 112 (Bom) and also

by a Division Bench of the Gujarat High Court in Commissioner of

Income-Tax v. Becharbhai P. Parmar reported in (2012) 341 ITR 499 (Guj).

</p><p id="p_7">          For these reasons, the impugned order of the Tribunal is set aside.

          We restore the order of the Commissioner (Appeals) dated 31st

August 2005.
</p>
<p id="p_8">          This appeal is accordingly allowed.
</p>
<p id="p_9">          Certified photocopy of this order, if applied for, be supplied to the

parties upon compliance with all requisite formalities.



</p><p id="p_10">                                                       (I. P. MUKERJI, J.)
