                    appellant contended that there is one day's delay in lodging

                    the FIR, which has not been satisfactorily explained. She

                    further contended that the injured and eye witness are

                    closely related to each other. No independent witness has

                    been associated or examined to corroborate their version.

                    She further contended that in-fact deceased-accused Tota

                    Singh was not present at the spot as he was an old man of

                    about 65 years of age. He was having weak eye sight and

                    was unable to walk without the support of the stick. Injured

                    Jagdev Singh was drunkard and raised the dispute with

                    appellant Bhupinder Singh. Both the injured grappled with

                    him. Surjan Singh suffered minor injuries as a result of fall.

                    They suffered the injuries from Rajinder Singh son of

                    Chhota Singh and falsely implicated the appellants.

                    only with the aid of <a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_34">Section 34</a> of IPC. All the injuries

                    attributed to appellant Bhupinder Singh are simple in

                    nature. He has already undergone about nine months of

                    sentence, which is a quite sufficient period and pleaded for

                    reduction in the matter of sentence.

                    contended that the delay in lodging the FIR is well explained

                    as the injured were unfit to make the statement. There is

                    nothing      to    disbelieve   the   testimonies      of    the   injured

                    witnesses. It is not established that the occurrence was

                    witnessed by any other independent witness. Moreover, the

                    testimonies of the injured witnesses can be acted upon even

                    without      any     corroboration.       But,   in   this   case    their

                    testimonies are corroborated from the statements of PW-4

                    Sant Kaur as well as the medical evidence. There is no

                    evidence to establish the defence plea raised by the

                    appellant that the injuries on the person of complainant

                    Jagdev Singh and his father Surjan Singh were suffered

                    from the friendly hand.

<p id="p_12">                    12.          She further contended that appellant Bhupinder

                    Singh       has    caused    eight    injuries   on    the    person    of

                    complainant Jagdev Singh. So, sentence awarded to him is

                    fully justified and does not call for any reduction.

                    03.04.2002 at about 3.30.p.m. The injured reached the

                    hospital on the same day at 5.20 p.m, which is evident from

                    their MLR's Ex.PA and Ex.PE. The doctor has sent the

                    memo Ex.PH to the S.H.O, Police Station Sardulgarh giving

                    the information about admission of the injured in the

                    hospital. The Investigating Officer moved application Ex.PJ

                    with respect to Jagdev Singh and Ex.PK with respect to

                    Surjan Singh on the same day, but injured were declared

                    unfit to make the statement vide endorsements Ex.PJ/1 and

                    Ex.PK/1 dated 03.04.2002 at 8.25 p.m and 8.30 p.m

                    respectively. However, they were declared fit to make

                    thereafter the statement of complainant Jagdev Singh Ex.PN

                    was recorded at 11.35 a.m on 04.04.2002. In this manner

                    the delay in lodging the FIR is almost explained as previous

                    to that the injured were declared unfit to make the

                    a Soti to his father Surjan Singh. His testimony is fully

                    corroborated from the statement of PW-3 Surjan Singh.

                    Both these witnesses are the stamped witnesses being

                    injured. It is settled principle of law that the testimonies of

                    the injured witnesses caries great evidentiary value as their

                    presence at the spot is certified from the injuries on their

                    person. The testimonies of the injured witnesses can be

                    acted upon even without any corroboration. The statements

                    of both injured are fully corroborated from the statement of

                    PW-4 Sant Kaur, the witness of the occurrence. She has

                    also categorically stated that she saw Tota Singh and

                    Bhupinder Singh armed with their weapons running away

                    from the spot and both complainant Jagdev Singh and her

                    husband Surjan Singh were lying on the ground in injured

                    condition.   The    aforesaid   ocular   evidence    is     fully

                    corroborated from the medical evidence. Ex.PA is the MLR of

                    injured Surjan Singh, which shows that he has suffered four

                    injuries on his person including the fracture of          greater

                    trochanter of right femur. Complainant Jagdev Singh as per

                    the MLR Ex.PE has suffered eight injuries on his person.

                    There is no clear evidence on record to establish that any

                    independent person was attracted to the spot. It is well

                    settled principle of law that mere relationship of the witness

                    with the victims is no ground to discard his/her testimony.

                    So, there is no ground to ignore the statement of PW-4 Sant

                    Kaur simply on the ground that she happens to be the

                    mother of the complainant and wife of injured Surjan Singh.

                    Learned defence counsel has not been able to point out any

                    material contradiction in the statements of the injured

                    witnesses and the eye witness on the mode of occurrence.

                    So, there is nothing to disbelieve their testimonies.

</p><p id="p_16">                    16.         The plea raised by appellant Bhupinder Singh

                    that the injured suffered the injuries at the hands of

                    Rajinder Singh son of Chhota Singh in order to falsely

                    implicate the appellants does not appeal to the reasons.

                    Firstly, there is no evidence on record to establish the

                    presence of said Rajinder Singh at the time of occurrence.

                    Secondly, it is not possible that complainant Jagdev Singh

                    and injured Surjan Singh would suffer so much injuries

                    from the friendly hand just to falsely implicate the

                    appellants, when this target can be achieved even with few

                    minor injures. PW-3 Surjan Singh has suffered four injuries

                    on his person including the fracture of greater trochanter of

                    right femur. Complainant Jagdev Singh has suffered eight

                    injuries. Five injuries out of those are incised wound. Injury

                    no. 7 is on the right parental region. The number of injuries

                    suffered by the injured witnesses totally belies the version of

                    the appellants.

                    evidence adduced by the prosecution, there is no escape

                    from the conclusion that the accused have caused injuries

                    to complainant Jagdev Singh and his father Surjan Singh in

                    furtherance of their common intention and the conviction of

                    pleaded for the reduction of sentence. The grievous injury

                    on the person of Surjan Singh was attributed to deceased-

                    appellant Tota Singh, who has died during the pendency of

                    the present appeal on 01.06.2008 and appeal qua him

                    already stands abated. So, now in the present appeal we are

                    only concerned with the appellant Bhupinder Singh. No

                    injury on the person of Surjan Singh, who has suffered the

                    grievous injury is attributed to the present appellant. As per

                    the prosecution version, he has caused injuries with a

                    Gandasa to complainant Jagdev Singh. The MLR of Jagdev

                    Singh is Ex.PE, which shows that complainant Jagdev Singh

                    has suffered eight injuries on his person. Injury no. 7

                    measuring 3 cm X 0.5 cm is on the right parietal region of

                    complainant Jagdev Singh. All other seven injuries are on

                    the non vital part of the body. Vide MLR Ex.PE itself,

                    injuries no. 2, 3, 4 and 8 were declared simple in nature.

                    After receipt of the x-ray report remaining injuries i.e injury

                    no. 1, 5, 6 and 7 were also declared simple vide opinion of

                    the doctor Ex.PF. Thus, all the injuries attributed to the

                    present appellant Bhupinder Singh on the person of

                    complainant Jagdev Singh are simple in nature.

                    dispute i.e the dispute regarding irrigation of the field. Both

                    the parties are closely related to each other. Appellant

                    Bhupinder Singh is the nephew of injured Surjan Singh and

                    cousin brother of complainant-injured Jagdev Singh. The

                    present occurrence has taken place on 03.04.2002. The

                    appellant has faced the agony of this litigation for the last

                    more than twelve years. The custody certificate of appellant

                    Bhupinder Singh shows that he has already undergone

                    eight months and twenty nine days out of the sentence

                    awarded to him. The maximum sentence awarded to the

                    appellant Bhupinder Singh was two years. Out of that he

                    has already undergone eight months and twenty nine days

                    i.e. about nine months. Keeping in view the facts and

                    circumstances of this case and the nature of the injuries

                    attributed to the appellant, the period already undergone by

                    him in jail is quite sufficient punishment. In addition to that

                    appellant Bhupinder Singh can be directed to pay a

                    reasonable amount of compensation to the injured.

                    each) to injured Surjan Singh and complainant injured
