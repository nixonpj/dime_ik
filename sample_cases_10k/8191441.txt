<p id="p_1">1.                      This   is   an   appeal   filed   on   behalf   of   appellant   aggrieved   by   the 

judgment dated 16.4.2014 and order on sentence dated 28.04.2014 whereby 

appellant was convicted for the offence u/s 138 <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_2">N.I. Act</a> and was sentenced to 

undergo   SI   for   one   year   alongwith   fine/compensation   of   Rs.   1,00,000/­,   in

 default, SI for three months. 
</p>
<p id="p_2">2.                      A complaint was filed against the appellant on the allegations that 

he had purchased kiryana goods from the complainant on various dates against 

different bills between 2.4.2007 to 16.4.2007 and had issued several postdated 

cheques towards the discharge of said liability i.e. against the said purchases, 

out   of   which   cheque   bearing   no.   517669   dated   7.5.2007   for   sum   of   Rs. 

1,00,000/­ drawn on ING Vyasa Bank Ltd,  Yamuna Vihar Branch, Delhi was 

returned   dishonoured   on   presentation   to   bank   for   encashment     for   want   of 

sufficient funds. Appellant failed to repay the said amount despite issuance of 

legal demand notice, hence complainant was constrained to file the complaint 

u/s 138 <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_3">N.I. Act</a> against the appellant. The other post date cheques given were 

also dishonoured and separate complaints were filed regarding those cheques in 

which cases also , the similar order was passed and all the orders have been 

challenged   in   separate   appeals   before   this   court.   After   recording   of   the 

evidence of both the parties, Ld. trial court concluded regarding the existence 

of   liability   against   the   appellant   which   he   had   failed   to   discharge   and 

accordingly held him guilty.
</p>
<p id="p_3">3.                      Complainant had placed on record the bills issued with respect to 

the   purchases   made   by   appellant,     the   cheque   issued   by   the   appellant   in 

discharge of said liability against the purchases and the service of legal demand 

notice.   It   was   submitted   by   Ld.   counsel   for   appellant   that   the   alleged 

bills/invoices were not signed by the accused/appellant, therefore it cannot be 

said   that   the   goods   were   actually   received   by   the   appellant.   It   was   further 

submitted that the bills  mentioned contain reference to name of one Mr. Sachin 

to   whom   the   goods   were   supplied   and   in   the   cross   examination   also,   the 


Crl. Appeal No.:18/2014                                                                                                                                 2/7
 complainant   stated   that   he   could   produce   said   Sachin   to   corroborate   his 

contention but said person was never produced by him in the evidence, yet the 

adverse inference of this fact was taken against the appellant instead of being 

against the complainant upon whom the burden lied to examine said Sachin. 

Ld. counsel for petitioner placed reliance upon S.K. Mittal Vs. Saree Mehal 

2012 (2) DCR 384 wherein it was observed that " non examination of material 

witness is fatal to the case of complainant ". While relying upon the abovesaid , 

it was also submitted that since the complainant  has not examined the material 

witness namely Sachin, therefore his evidence for want of corroboration cannot 

be relied upon. It was further submitted that accused/appellant was merely the 

broker of Kiryana goods and acted as middle man with respect to the deal of 

supply of goods between the complainant and various purchasers. He had given 

cheque in question alongwith other cheques as security to the complainant for 

payments to be made by various purchasers/retailers. However, payments were 

directly made to the complainant against the purchases made and the cheques 

issued by the accused as security were mis used by the complainant.

</p><p id="p_4">4.                      It may be noted that the case of complainant is based upon the bills 

issued for the purchase of goods by the appellant and the issuance of cheques 

by   him   in   discharge   of   that   liability   and   though   it   was   admitted   by   the 

complainant who was examined as CW1 that there was no mention of receiving 

of bills either by the accused or by his agent but he clarified that there was no 

such trade practice in the market. In the bills raised, contrary to the assertions 

of Ld. counsel for appellant that the bills apparently mention about name of one 

Sachin to whom the goods were supplied, the reference to name of said Sachin 

is as of the middle man and not the person in whose name the bills were raised. 


</p><p id="p_5">Crl. Appeal No.:18/2014                                                                                                                                 3/7
 It  was   specifically   stated   by   the   complainant   that   the   appellant  used   to   get 

goods for himself   however used to mention the name   through Sachin Dalal 

while denying the suggesting that accused himself used to work as Dalal in the 

market and that he worked as Commission Agent for complainant to supply the 

goods   to   retailers   and   further   stated   that   accused   had   not   worked   as 

Commission agent for him at any point of time. 
</p>
<p id="p_6">5.                      Per contra, it was stated by appellant   as DW1 that he had been 

working as Commission Agent for the complainant and had given cheques in 

the signed form as security to the complainant for business purposes which was 

given to him in good faith so that complainant  can send goods to the concerned 

retailers. According to him, the retailers had given payment to the complainant 

directly.   Having   considered   the   abovesaid,   if   according   to   appellant,   the 

retailers had given payment to the complainant directly and the cheques issued 

by him as security were required to be returned to him and were not to be 

presented   against   the   purchase   of   goods   as   per   his   defence,   it   was   the 

responsibility of appellant to discharge the said onus that the payment had been 

made by the retailers to the complainant directly and the security cheques were 

required   to   be   returned   to   him.   There   is   also   nothing   on   record   that   the 

appellant   had   ever   asked   for   return   of   those   security   cheques   from   the 

complainant after the payments had been received by the complainant against 

the  purchases  made  by  the  alleged retailers. Complainant of course  has not 

examined said Sachin who was allegedly working as middle man   to depose 

with   respect   to   deals   between   the   complainant   and   the   appellant   but   the 

complainant having already placed on record the bills and the cheques issued 

in   his   favour   for   the   invoiced   amount,   the   appellant   himself   could   have 


Crl. Appeal No.:18/2014                                                                                                                                 4/7
 examined said Sachin to discharge the said onus upon him with respect to the 

payments having already been made to the complainant against the purchases 

made. It was rather admitted by him that all the particulars in the cheques had 

been filled up in his own handwriting. As matter of fact and of prudence, the 

cheques  which  are  issued  as  security  would  not be  for  the   specific  amount 

when   even   the   liability   had   not   been   ascertained.   Ld.   trial   court   rightly 

appreciated with the observation that in normal course of nature, in case the 

cheques are issued as security without ascertainment of exact liability, in such 

cases   the   cheques   are   usually   issued   in   blank   without   any   amount   and   the 

security purpose can be duly served by issuance of one single cheque whereas 

the appellant had issued several cheques himself by filling all particulars in 

those cheques. 
</p>
<p id="p_7">6.                      Instant   appeal   is   regarding   one   cheque   whereas   similar   is   the 

position in other six appeals before this court. As asserted by  appellant, he was 

working as a middle man but as rightly concluded by Ld. trial  that the accused 

had not led any evidence to prove that he had no legal liability by examining 

any   such   retailer   to   whom   the   goods   must   have   been   supplied   by   the 

complainant   and   by   whom   the   payment   would   have   been   made   to   the 

complainant. The contention of Ld. Counsel for appellant with respect to non 

examination of the material witnesses was rightly answered by Ld. Trial court 

that the suggestion put by the accused to complainant in his cross examination 

render the onus of proof upon the accused to establish that the goods were 

delivered and bills were issued to the said person namely Sachin or the other 

retailers and not to the  accused which onus was not discharged by the accused 

by examining said Sachin or any other witness to that effect. 


</p><p id="p_8">Crl. Appeal No.:18/2014                                                                                                                                 5/7
</p><p id="p_9"> 7.                      With   respect   to   the   judgment   as   placed   reliance   upon   by   Ld. 

Counsel   for   appellant,   though   it   is   correct   that   the   standard   of   proof   to 

discharge burden upon accused to rebut presumption raised by court u/s 139 of 

<a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_4">N.I. Act</a> is not the same as upon prosecution to prove the case. However, in the 

instant matter, it was the appellant himself who had taken the defence with 

respect to raising of the bills against Sachin or supply of goods to other retailers 

and onus to prove the said plea was also upon the appellant himself which he 

failed to discharge besides the fact that the cheque in question was filled up in 

own handwriting of the appellant and the observation in the authority (supra) 

rather   goes   against   the   very   own   contention   of   Ld.   Counsel   for   appellant 

himself wherein it was observed that " no reasonable or prudent man can be 

expected to issue a cheque filled in on all other particulars except the name of 

payee, particularly so when the drawer of the cheque knows that the cheque is 

being issued to a particular person for repayment of a particular amount" . 

</p><p id="p_10">8.                      In the instant matter, as already observed, the cheque in question 

was filled up in own handwriting of the appellant for the specific sum for which 

payment   was   raised   and   at   the   cost   of  repetition   it  may   be   mentioned   that 

accused having failed to discharge the onus laid down upon him , no fault can 

be found in the judgment passed by Ld. Trial court. Accordingly, finding no 

merits in the appeal, same is dismissed. 
</p>
<p id="p_11">9.                      However, leniency in sentence is prayed for. Appellant is stated to 

be 39 years of age who has the family consisting of his wife and aged parents 

all of whom are dependent upon him and the appellant, as stated, is ready to 

compensate the respondent. Considering the abovesaid, in substitution to the 

sentence   awarded   by   ld.   trial   court,   appellant   is   directed   to   deposit   the 


Crl. Appeal No.:18/2014                                                                                                                                 6/7
 compensation/fine amount of Rs. 1,60,000/­, out of which Rs. 1,30,000/­ shall 

be payable to the complainant. On failure of the appellant to pay/deposit the 

said   amount,   he   shall   undergo   the   sentence   as   awarded   by   Ld.   trial   court. 

Appeal is disposed off in above terms.
