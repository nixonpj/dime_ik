             ---------------------------------------
                W.P.(c) No. 39287 of 2015
                                &amp;
                 W.P.(c) No. 426 of 2016
             ----------------------------------------
            Dated this the 01st day of February, 2016

                           JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">      The   petitioner,  whose     membership     in   the   third

respondent Society is disputed, has a grievance that the Joint

Registrar,   exercising  the    powers   of   the   Registrar   of

Co-operative Societies, registered the third respondent Society

despite the fact that most of the promoting members resided

outside the area of the Society. In this regard, the petitioner

is said to have submitted Exhibit P4 representation before the

Registrar of Co-operative Societies, the first respondent.

</p><p id="p_2">      2. Ventilating his grievance, among other things, that so

far the authorities concerned have not considered his

objections, the petitioner has filed the present writ petition.

</p><p id="p_3">      3. The third respondent Society, in turn, filed W.P. (C)

No. 426/16 seeking a direction to the State Co-operative

Election Commission, the second respondent therein, to

conduct election to the Managing Committee of the Society, at

the earliest. Taking W.P. (C) No.39287 of 2015 as the basis,

this Court disposes of both the writ petitions through this

common judgment.
</p>
<p id="p_4"><span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">W.P.(c) Nos. 39287/15 &amp; 426/16    2</span>



</p><p id="p_5">      4. In response to the submissions made by the learned

counsel for the petitioner, the learned counsel for the third

respondent has submitted that this Court may dispose of the

writ petition directing the Joint Registrar, who is not a party to

the proceedings, to dispose of the petitioner's Exhibit P4

objections, after affording an opportunity of hearing to the

third respondent Society as well as the petitioner.

</p><p id="p_6">      5. In reply, the learned counsel for the petitioner has

submitted that the election proposed to be held to the third

respondent Society may be contingent upon the order to be

passed on the petitioner's Exhibit P4 application. The learned

counsel has also submitted that instead of the Joint Registrar,

the Registrar of the Co-operative Societies may decide the

petitioner's Exhibit P4 application.
</p>
<p id="p_7">      6. At the outset, this Court makes it clear that it has no

intention to decide the writ petition on merits for the issue has

already been seized of by a competent authority, be it the

Registrar of the Co-operative Societies or the Joint Registrar.

As regards the contention of the learned counsel for the

petitioner that the issue be decided by the Registrar of

Co-operative Societies, I may have to hold that this Court

whimsically does not denude an authority of his statutory

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">W.P.(c) Nos. 39287/15 &amp; 426/16     3</span>



power, provided he has been conferred with such power.

Under these circumstances, this Court makes it clear that if at

all statute permits the Joint Registrar to adjudicate on

petitioner's Exhibit P4 application, he shall do so. On the other

hand, if statute empowers only the Registrar of Co-operative

Societies, it shall be his turn to consider petitioner's objections.

</p><p id="p_8">      In conclusion, this Court disposes of both the writ

petitions with a direction to the first respondent or the Joint

Registrar of Thiruvananthapuram, whoever is empowered, to

consider petitioner's Exhibit P4 objections concerning the

registration of the third respondent Society and pass

appropriate orders thereon, after affording an opportunity of

hearing to the third respondent Society as well as the

petitioner, as expeditiously as possible, at any rate, with a

period of one month from the date of receipt of a copy of this

judgment.
</p>
<p id="p_9">      It is further made clear that the election proposed to be

held to the third respondent Society shall be contingent upon

the orders to be passed either by the first respondent or by the

Joint Registrar, as the case may be.
