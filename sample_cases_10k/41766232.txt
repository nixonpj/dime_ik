<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">FIR No.116/08 , PS Kalyan Puri           1</span>
 Brief reasons for the decision of the case.

</pre><p id="p_2">1.              The   prosecution   has   alleged   against   accused   Kallu   that   on 

14.04.2008 at about 7.45 p.m. at Ambedkar Chowk, Kalyanpuri, Delhi,   he was 

apprehended by PW2(Ct. Brijesh Kumar) &amp; Ct.Kali Charan with a buttondar knife 

in contravention of the notification of the Delhi Government. 

</p><p id="p_3">2.              The charge was framed against the accused U/s 25 of  <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_5">Arms Act</a> by 

the Ld. Predecessor on 14.01.2009. The accused pleaded not guilty and claimed 

trial. 
</p>
<p id="p_4">3.              The   prosecution   has   examined   PW2   apart   from   the   DO   and 

IO(   PW­1   and   PW­3   respectively).   The   accused   did   not   lead   any   evidence   in 

defence. 
</p>
<p id="p_5">4.              The Ld. APP has prayed for conviction on the testimony of PW2  to 

the effect that as he was on checking duty alongwith Ct. Kali Charan at Ambedkar 

Chowk on 14.4.2008, they saw the accused approaching them on a scooter and 

then   attempting   to   escape.   The   two   constables   apprehended   the   accused   and 

recovered a buttondar knife from him. The   IO i.e. ASI Omvir Singh ( PW­3) 

reached the spot and seized the knife vide memo Ex. PW2/B whereas the sketch of 

the same was prepared and exhibited as Ex. PW2/A.   The FIR ExPW1/A was 

recorded on the basis of statement  Ex. PW2/C made by PW­2. 

</p><p id="p_6">5.              It   was   argued   by   the   Ld.   Prosecutor   that   PW2   and   PW3   had 

identified the accused and verified his arrest alongwith recovery of knife and that 


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">FIR No.116/08 , PS Kalyan Puri                  2</span>
 the knife had been identified by them. 
</p>
<p id="p_7">6.                The counsel for the accused argued that the purported recovery is 

concocted and that the absence of any public witness renders the deposition of the 

police witness unworthy of belief. Further, that the particulars of the FIR were 

found mentioned on the sketch and seizure memo of the knife notwithstanding the 

fact   that   the  same  were  prepared  before   the  registration   of   the  FIR.   This  was 

indicated to be evidence of the false implication of the accused by the policemen 

in question.  
</p>
<p id="p_8">7.               It   is   seen   that   the   prosecution   is   based   on   routine   allegations 

concerning   policemen   on   patrol/   checking   duty   coming   across   a   purportedly 

suspicious person who attempts to escape and is apprehended with a prohibited 

weapon,   which   is   mostly   a   knife.   Such   cases   are   generally   hampered   by   the 

absence of public witnesses and the present trial is no exception.  It is notable that 

the time of occurrence was around 07:45 p.m. and the place of occurrence was a 

busy intersection. The presence of public persons was only to be expected.  Infact, 

PW2 and PW3,  admitted the presence of public persons by stating that no such 

public   witness   joined   the   investigation   despite   the   requests.   Such   stereo   typed 

explanations do not carry any weight, as the non examination of available persons 

is in excusable. No written notice was served upon the purported public persons 

present at the spot. Resultantly, the Court is left with no means of independent 

verification of the version of the police witnesses. The Court is  inclined to see the 


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">FIR No.116/08 , PS Kalyan Puri                   3</span>
 evidence as convenient to the police witnesses. Reliance cannot be placed on their 

testimony in the absence of corroboration by independent witnesses. 

</p><p id="p_9">8.             The   Ld.   Defence   Counsel   was   also   justified   in   doubting   the 

prosecution version on the basis of the appearance of the FIR No. on the sketch 

and seizure memo of the knife notwithstanding the registration of the FIR after 

these documents were prepared. The possibility of false implication on the basis of 

manipulated documents cannot be ruled out.
</p>
<p id="p_10">9.             The accused is granted the benefit of doubt and is acquitted of the 

charge framed U/s 25 of <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_6">Arms Act</a>.
