    SRI V. PADMANABHA MAHALE, SR. COUNSEL
     SRI M. SHIVAPRAKASH, ADV. FOR R-4
     NOTICE TO R-3 HELD SUFFICIENT)


     THIS PETITION IS FILED UNDER ARTICLES 226 AND
227 OF THE CONSTITUTION OF INDIA, PRAYING TO;
DECLARE THAT THE R1 KSFC HAS NO POWER UNDER
SECTION 29 OF THE STATE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONS
ACT 1951 TO SELL THE GUARANTOR'S/SURETY'S PROPERTY
AND THE SAME IS ULTRA VIRES TO THE ACT; DECLARE
THAT THE PROCEEDINGS INITIATED UNDER SECTION 29
OF THE ACT UNDER THE ORIGINAL OF ANNEX-B DTD
25.02.99 AND CONSEQUENTIAL ACTIONS ARE ILLEGAL
AND ULTRA VIRES TO THE ACT AND QUASH THE SAME
AND ETC.


    THIS PETITION COMING ON FOR HEARING, THIS DAY,
THE COURT MADE THE FOLLOWING :

                    ORDER
</pre>

<p id="p_1">      The petitioner is before this Court assailing the

proceedings initiated under <a href="/doc/922514/" id="a_1">Section 29</a> of the State

Financial Corporation Act, 1951, (for short the 'Act') as
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                  3</span>

per Annexure-B dated 25.02.1999. The petitioner is also

seeking that the order dated 13.06.2000 impugned at

Annexure-G be declared to be illegal and ultra vires to the

Act. The consequential relief of cancellation of the sale

made by the respondent - KSFC is also sought.



</p><p id="p_2">     2.     The brief facts are that the petitioner was the

owner of the immovable property bearing No.46/1,

Hesaraghatta Main Road, T. Dasarahalli, Bangalore. The

petitioner who had acquired the said property under a

registered Release Deed dated 07.04.1994 had offered the

same as security as a guarantor in respect of the loan

advanced by respondent No. 1 to respondent No. 3 herein.

In that regard, respondent No.1 had initiated action for

recovery for the loan amounts when respondent No. 3 has

defaulted      in     payment.       While       addressing        the

communication dated 25.02.1999, it was indicated that if

respondent No.3 does not clear the loan, respondent No.1

would     initiate   proceedings     for   selling   the    property

belonging to the petitioner on recovering the said amount.

Subsequent      thereto,   the     sale    has   taken     place   on
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                  4</span>

13.06.2000. The contention put forth by the petitioner in

the instant petition is that the property belonging to the

guarantor could not have been sold by respondent No.1 in

exercise of the powers under <a href="/doc/922514/" id="a_2">Section 29</a> of the Act, more

particularly in view of the law declared by the Hon'ble

Supreme Court. It is in that circumstance, the petitioner

is before this Court.
</p>
<p id="p_3">
</p><p id="p_4">     3.    Insofar as the position of law as declared by the

Hon'ble   Supreme       Court    by   the    order   passed     in

<a href="/doc/389917/" id="a_3">Karnataka      State      Financial         Corporation       -vs-

N. Narasimhaiah</a> [(2008) 5 SCC 176] is that the State

Financial Corporation would not be entitled to invoke the

provisions of <a href="/doc/922514/" id="a_4">Section 29</a> of the Act against the property

belonging to the guarantor and offered as security, is the

established   position.         However,     the   question    for

consideration in the instant petition is as to whether

though the said legal aspect has been raised in the instant

petition, whether it is necessary for this Court to examine

the same in the facts and circumstances arising in the

instant case, more particularly when the petitioner has
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                    5</span>

approached this Court by filing the instant petition on

10.07.2009 in respect of a sale that had been conducted in

the year 2000.         To appreciate this aspect, what is also

necessary to be noticed is that the petitioner in fact had

filed an earlier petition in W.P.No.8686/2004.         The said

petition had been withdrawn on 17.06.2004 reserving

liberty to file a fresh petition, if the same became

necessary.        Notwithstanding the liberty granted therein,

the present petition has been filed only on 10.07.2009

after five years.         Though the petitioner seeks to explain

the same by stating that he has thought it fit to file the

writ petition in view of the law declared by the Hon'ble

Supreme Court, the said explanation also cannot be

accepted keeping in view the explanation put forth in the

petition, when the liberty granted had not been exercised

from    2004,       the    subsequent   decision   being   taken

advantage of cannot be an explanation.
</p>
<p id="p_5">
</p><p id="p_6">       4.    It    cannot be lost sight that in between, the

Hon'ble Division Bench of this Court had already taken a

view with regard to the said position and that order in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                               6</span>

ILR 2003 Kar 3344 (DB) was already available when

the earlier petition was filed and this question of power

under <a href="/doc/922514/" id="a_5">Section 29</a> of the Act was already raised in that

petition. Even otherwise, what is also to be kept in view

in the present case is that the children of the petitioner

have also approached this Court on the same ground. In

that regard, a petition in W.P.No.19551/2005 was filed

wherein the issue relating to exercise of the power by the

respondent-KSFC by invoking <a href="/doc/922514/" id="a_6">Section 29</a> of the Act was

also raised.    The said petition was disposed of on

16.09.2008 wherein this Court had taken note of the fact

that the children of the petitioner herein had already

instituted a civil suit which was pending before the Court

below and the law as declared by the Hon'ble Supreme

Court in the case of N. Narasimhaiah, can also be urged

in the said suit as the position of law could be brought to

notice of the Court.     In such situation, when the said

issue could still be urged by the persons who are claiming

right to the property, viz., the children of the petitioner in

the said suit and when the petitioner is also a party to the

said suit, this issue in any event would be considered
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                               7</span>

therein in view of the leave granted by this Court in the

earlier writ petition.
</p>
<p id="p_7">

</p><p id="p_8">     5.   If this aspect of the matter is kept in view, in any

event, the instant petition which has been filed by the

petitioner after long lapse of withdrawing the earlier writ

petition does not merit further examination by this Court.

In any event, liberty is reserved to the petitioner to put

forth his contention in the suit wherein he is a defendant.



</p><p id="p_9">     In terms of the above, the writ petition stands

disposed of.
</p>
<p id="p_10">

</p><p id="p_11">                                           Sd/-
</p><p id="p_12">                                          JUDGE
