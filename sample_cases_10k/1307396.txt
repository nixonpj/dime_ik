Basheer, J.

<p id="p_2">

</p><p id="p_3">     In this appeal filed under <a href="/doc/1656413/" id="a_1">Section 37(a)</a> of the Arbitration

and <a href="/doc/1306164/" id="a_2">Conciliation Act</a>, 1996, the order passed by the District

Court, Ernakulam in a proceeding under <a href="/doc/1120409/" id="a_3">Section 9</a> of the Act is

under challenge.
</p>
<p id="p_4">

</p><p id="p_5">     2.   By the impugned order, the appellant/Educational

Trust, who was the respondent in the Original Petition before

the court below, has been restrained from interfering with the

functioning of the telecommunication system installed on the

tower erected on the terrace of its building and from preventing

the personnel of the respondents from having access to the

tower and also the shelter (generator room) at the basement of

the said building; and from doing any maintenance and repair

works on the tower and the generator "till culmination of the

arbitration proceedings." The appellant has been further

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">Arbitration Appeal.No.34/2008      2</span>


directed to remove the lock put by it at the entry point to the

building premises so as to enable the respondents to have free

access to the tower and the generator room.
</p>
<p id="p_6">

</p><p id="p_7">       3.     In the nature of the order that we propose to pass, we

do not deem it necessary to advert to or deal with the various

contentions raised by the parties in the case elaborately.

However, we deem it appropriate to refer to the essential facts

which led to this litigation.
</p>
<p id="p_8">

</p><p id="p_9">       4.     It is the admitted position that the appellant and

respondent No.1 had entered into a 'Leave And Licence

Agreement' on 21st October, 2005, whereunder the appellant has

granted permission to respondent No.1 "to install, deinstall and

maintain" certain equipments upon the terrace portion of the

licensor's (appellant) building in a specified area and also on the

basement.
</p>
<p id="p_10">

</p><p id="p_11">       5.     It appears that respondent No.1 entered into a

'Business Transfer Agreement' with respondent No.2 at New

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">Arbitration Appeal.No.34/2008    3</span>


Delhi on 8th November, 2007, under which respondent No.1, who

styled itself as the seller agreed to "transfer, sell and or assign"

the business which was being carried on by respondent No.1 at

the premise of the appellant. Pursuant to the above agreement,

respondent No.1 issued Ext.A1 letter to the appellant intimating

about the transfer of business.
</p>
<p id="p_12">

</p><p id="p_13">       6.     The appellant took exception to the above action

taken by respondent No.1 and informed it that the 'Leave and

Licence Agreement' (Ext.A3) stood terminated as per clause 9 of

the agreement. Respondent No.1 was further informed that the

equipments erected on the terrace and at the basement be

removed immediately. It was further informed that the security

deposit would be refunded to respondent No.1 as soon as the

equipments were removed. It was further made clear that in the

absence of any privity of contract between the appellant and

respondent No.2, the latter had no right to enter into the

premises of the appellant. Respondent No.1 was cautioned that

any attempt on the part of the respondent No.1 to commit

trespass would result in appropriate criminal action.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">Arbitration Appeal.No.34/2008      4</span>


</p><p id="p_14">       7.     Apparently provoked by the above response from the

appellant, the respondents filed the original petition under

<a href="/doc/1120409/" id="a_4">Section 9</a> of the Act seeking appropriate reliefs.              Two

interlocutory applications were filed by the respondents praying,

inter alia, for issue of an order of interim prohibitory injunction

restraining the appellant, their men and agents from interfering

with the functioning of the telecommunication system installed

on the tower erected on the terrace of the building and also the

generator room at the basement of the said building. The prayer

in the other interlocutory application was to permit the

respondents to break open the lock put on the grills in front of

the generator room and to enable them to refuel the generator.

The further prayer was to afford adequate police protection to

gain access to the tower.
</p>
<p id="p_15">

</p><p id="p_16">       8.     The appellant stoutly resisted the prayers made in the

two applications and contended inter alia that the reliefs sought

for were wholly untenable. The primary contention was that the

Leave And Licence Agreement between the appellant and

respondent No.1 stood automatically terminated because of the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">Arbitration Appeal.No.34/2008      5</span>


illegal    and     unauthorised  transfer of business   made by

respondent No.1 in favour of respondent No.2. Since respondent

No.1 had already transferred its business rights in favour of

respondent No.2, the reliefs sought for in the two applications

could not be granted. It was further contended that there was

no privity of contract between the appellant and respondent

No.2 and therefore, no relief could be granted in favour of

respondent No.2 as against the appellant. The other contention

was that the provisions of the Act could not be invoked in the

absence of any arbitration clause governing the parties.



</p><p id="p_17">       9.     As mentioned earlier, we do not propose to deal

extensively with the contentions raised by the parties at this

stage.
</p>
<p id="p_18">

</p><p id="p_19">       10. The        court  below, after considering   the   rival

contentions of the parties, came to the conclusion that it was a fit

case in which interim measure had to be taken in favour of the

respondents as otherwise irreparable injury would be caused to

them. The court held that respondent No.2 had attained the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">Arbitration Appeal.No.34/2008    6</span>


status of successor-in-interest to the business of respondent No.1

by virtue of Ext.A7. In other words, the court held that

respondent No.2 is "truly the successor-in-interest of the 1st

respondent and thus it continues to be the licensee". Thus the

court below concluded that prima facie there was no violation of

any of the clauses contained in Ext.A3 agreement and that the

respondents were therefore entitled to the reliefs sought for.



</p><p id="p_20">       11. While dealing with the case, the court below noticed

that the respondents had already issued Ext.A11 notice dated

29.8.2008 informing the appellant that they intended to initiate

arbitration proceedings invoking clause 15 of Ext.A3 agreement

in order to resolve the dispute that had arisen. Name of the

arbitrator was also indicated in Ext.A11 communication. The

appellant was therefore, requested to inform as to whether it

agreed for appointment of the arbitrator named in the notice.



</p><p id="p_21">       12. The court below noticed that the respondents had

already taken steps to set in motion the arbitration proceedings.

This impression of the court below is apparent from the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">Arbitration Appeal.No.34/2008     7</span>


impugned order itself, because in the concluding paragraph of

the impugned order it has been made clear by the court below

that the order of interim prohibitory injunction and other

directions would remain in force "till the culmination of the

arbitration proceedings." The court below further directed that

the respondents "shall initiate steps to get an arbitrator

appointed as expeditiously as possible." It was made clear that

the order of injunction was to remain in force for a period of one

year from the date of the order. Thus it is clear from the order

itself that the court below wanted the respondents to take

immediate         steps to get an arbitrator appointed pursuant to

Ext.A11 communication sent by them to the appellant.



</p><p id="p_22">       13. However it is conceded by the learned counsel for the

respondents that no further steps had been taken in this regard

for the reason that this Court had passed an interim order of stay

of all further proceedings pursuant to the impugned order.



</p><p id="p_23">       14. It is true that while admitting the appeal, this Court

had ordered thus:
</p>
<p id="p_24"><span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">Arbitration Appeal.No.34/2008         8</span>




</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">              "In the meanwhile, there will be a stay of all
              further proceedings pursuant to the order
              under appeal. However, it is made clear that
              the    appellant   shall not   obstruct  the
              respondents from maintaining the system. In
              order to avoid any confusion with regard to
              the implementation of this order, we make it
              clear that it will be open to the respondents
              to    request     the   appellant   regarding
              maintenance of the system including the
              generator and, on such request, permission
              will be granted to the respondents to attend
              to the repair, maintenance, refueling of the
              generator etc. forthwith."</blockquote><p id="p_25">



</p><p id="p_26">       15. But to a query as to why the respondents did not take

any further steps to proceed with the arbitration as proposed by

them in Ext.A11, learned counsel submitted that the interim

order interdicted them from doing so. It is further submitted by

the learned counsel that the appellant had not responded to

Ext.A11 notice. According to the learned counsel, the conduct of

the appellant indicated that it was aware of appointment of an

arbitrator.
</p>
<p id="p_27"><span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">Arbitration Appeal.No.34/2008      9</span>


</p><p id="p_28">       16. But, it is contended by the learned counsel for the

appellant that arbitration clause has no relevance in the matter,

especially, after the admitted transfer of business interest by

respondent No.1 in favour of respondent No.2.           In Ext.A2

communication          itself, the appellant had   informed      the

respondents that Ext.A3 agreement stood terminated.



</p><p id="p_29">       17. Yet again, we do not propose to deal with the above

contentions raised by the parties since in our view this is a larger

issue which has to be dealt with by an appropriate forum. The

question whether or not the dispute, if any, is arbitrable has to

be decided in appropriate proceedings. The court below while

passing the impugned order obviously did not want the stalemate

to continue for ever. Therefore, it was made clear that the order

of injunction shall remain in force for only one year. It was also

directed in the order itself that the respondent shall take

immediate steps to get an arbitrator appointed and that the

arrangement made in the order would remain in force till the

culmination of the arbitration proceedings.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">Arbitration Appeal.No.34/2008    10</span>


</p><p id="p_30">       18. Having regard to the entire aspects of the matter and

having considered the various contentions raised by the learned

counsel on either side, we are of the view that the entire issue

has to be thrashed out by the parties before the appropriate

forum. In any view of the matter, the impugned order cannot be

allowed to perpetuate the stalemate.
</p>
<p id="p_31">

</p><p id="p_32">       19. Therefore, the appeal is disposed of making it clear

that the interim order shall remain in force only for a further

period of six weeks from today. It will be open to the parties to

take recourse to the remedies available to them in terms of the

clauses, if any, contained in the agreement.



</p><p id="p_33">       20. Learned counsel for the respondents submits that

immediate steps will be taken to get an arbitrator appointed in

terms of clause 15 of the agreement. It will be open to the

respondents to take recourse to such action, if so, advised.



</p><p id="p_34">       21. It is made clear that the interim order dated 16th

October, 2008 passed by this Court shall remain in force for a

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">Arbitration Appeal.No.34/2008     11</span>


further period of six weeks from today. It is further made clear

that all the contentions of the parties are left open. We hasten to

add that we have not decided any question on its merit in this

appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_35">

</p><p id="p_36">       The appeal is disposed of in the above terms.
