PER COURT :

</pre><p id="p_1">1.              Criminal Application No. 2791/2013 is filed by the State

for granting leave to file appeal as against accused Nos. 3 to 8 of

Sessions Case No. 24/2010, which was pending in the Court of

learned Additional Sessions Judge, Shrirampur. Respondent Nos. 3

to 8 are acquitted of the offences punishable under sections 302,

149, 120-B etc. of<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_1"> Indian Penal Code</a> and <a href="/doc/1507082/" id="a_2">section 3</a>, <a href="/doc/1227639/" id="a_3">5</a> r/w. 25 of

condonation of delay of 64 days caused in filing application for

getting similar permission. All the respondents are served in

proceeding filed for condonation of delay. First this application was

heard. Learned counsel Shri. Shelke represented the applicant and

learned counsel Shri. N.V. Gaware represented to respondent Nos.

4, 6 to 8. Nobody has filed appearance for remaining respondents.

In view of the contents of the application and submissions made,

this Court holds that sufficient cause is shown. The application is

allowed. Delay is condoned.

</p><p id="p_6">3.              After allowing the delay condonation application, the

application filed by brother of deceased Muzaffar Shaikh for grant

of leave to file appeal and also the appeal filed by the State were

heard. The record of evidence is already there and this Court has

carefully gone through the record. This Court has also perused the

reasoning given by the Trial Court.
</p>
<p id="p_7">

</p><p id="p_8">4.              The evidence on the record shows that there is

evidence on motive atleast as against accused No. 1. Accused Nos.

1 to 4 were present on the spot as per the versions given by the

eye witnesses. Accused Nos. 1 and 2 shot bullets from different fire

arms at deceased Ayyaub Shaikh and he was murdered on the spot

where eye witnesses were present. The evidence is given that

accused No. 3 was present on the spot and he had come with

accused Nos. 1 and 2 on motorcycle. Similar allegation is made as

against accused No. 4 that he was riding motorcycle and one

accused was pillion rider. In all five assailants had come to the spot

on two different motorcycles. Accused No. 4 remained on the

motorcycle, but accused Nos. 1 to 3 had alighted from the

motorcycle and then they had committed the offence. Active role is

attributed to accused Nos. 1 to 3. But the evidence is also against

accused No. 4 that he came with accused Nos. 1 to 3. Accused No.

5 is not identified, but evidence is given that one Wasim was riding

the other motorcycle. Wasim is not shown present before the Court

and he is shown as absconding accused. It can be said that his

matter can be considered by the Trial Court when he is traced out.



</p><p id="p_10">5.              Though the charge was framed under <a href="/doc/1897847/" id="a_5">section 120-B</a> of

IPC also, the evidence on the record shows that the CDR record in

respect of some accused who were present on the spot was

produced to show that they were in contact with each other. But,

there is nothing on the record to show that accused Nos. 5 to 8

were in touch with accused Nos. 1 and 2, who had used fire arms

for shooting at Ayyaub Shaikh. Some evidence is there as against

accused Sandeep given by one witness and the witness has

deposed that on one occasion, Sandeep had expressed that there

was plan to finish Ayyaub Shaikh. However, the material even if is

accepted as it is does not indicate that Sandeep had admitted that

he was part of conspiracy. Thus, there is no connecting evidence as

against accused Nos. 5 to 8 to show that they were involved in

conspiracy and had connection with the persons who had motive

for commission of the offence. The material available shows that

there is good arguable case atleast as against accused Nos. 3 and

4 as they were present on the spot at the time of commission of

offence and they are identified by atleast two witnesses. In view of

these circumstances, both the applications are allowed as against

accused Nos. 3 and 4. Permission is granted to file appeals against

them. Applications filed against remaining respondents, accused

stand rejected.

<p id="p_12">

</p><p id="p_13">6.              This Court has granted permission to the State and the

brother of the deceased to file appeals as against accused Nos. 3

and 4. The reasoning for the same is already given. For the same

reasons, this Court is admitting both the appeals as against

accused Nos. 3 and 4 only. Appeals are admitted accordingly.
