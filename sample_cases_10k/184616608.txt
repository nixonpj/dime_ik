            FAO No.1539 of 2011 has been filed by the claimants seeking

enhancement of compensation whereas FAO No. 3004 of 2011 has been

filed by the insurance Company to assail the award. CR No. 7240 of 2011

has been filed by the petitioner Kavita Mandal to express her grievance

against order dated 10.09.2011 passed by the Tribunal whereby application

for releasing balance 50% amount of fixed deposit has been rejected.

FAO No. 3004 of 2011

            Counsel for the insurance company has assailed findings of the

Tribunal on issue No. 1 ('whether accident in question took place due to

rash and negligent driving of vehicle No. HR 69B 3693 by respondent No.

1? OPP') attributing rash and negligent driving to offending Truck bearing

registration No. HR 69B 3693. It is argued that occurrence in question

took place when car driven by Naresh Mandal rammed into the Truck

going ahead. It is further argued that there is no evidence led by the

claimants with regard to distance maintained between Truck and Car in

order to show that the car driven by Naresh Mandal (since deceased) had

maintained safe distance from the Truck, in compliance with the Road

Regulations, 1989. In support of her contention, counsel has relied upon

judgment of Hon'ble the Supreme Court <a href="/doc/79552396/" id="a_1">Nishan Singh and others vs.

Oriental Insurance Company Limited</a> through Regional Manager and

others, 2018 (2) R.C.R. (Civil) 891.
</p>
<p id="p_4">            With regard to compensation assessed by the Tribunal, counsel

would urge that liability to pay income tax may be deducted in case the

claimants are awarded any compensation.

            There is no representation on behalf of the claimants who were

earlier being represented by a counsel.
</p>
<p id="p_7">            Before adverting to the submissions made by counsel for the

insurance company, it is appropriate to recapitulate the facts in brief,

attributing rash and negligent driving to the Truck in question. It is averred

that on 25.05.2009 in the early morning, the deceased was going towards

Delhi side in his Car. When he reached near Karhans Bus Stop, G.T. Road,

offending Truck bearing registration No. HR 69-B 3693 over took Car

bearing No. DL 6CK 0998 at a very high speed in a rash and negligent

manner and driver of offending Truck stopped the vehicle by applying

sudden brakes in middle of the road due to which car of the deceased struck

from back side of the offending truck and deceased died at the spot. FIR

No. 197 dated 25.05.2009 for offence punishable under <a href="/doc/1270101/" id="a_2">Sections 279</a> and

<a href="/doc/1371604/" id="a_3">304-A</a> of the Indian Penal Code was registered in Police Station Samalkha,

District Panipat against driver of the Truck.
</p>
<p id="p_8">            The driver and owner of offending vehicle filed the joint

written statement and denied averments raised in para 24 of claim

application with the pleadings that police of police station Smalakha,

Panipat in collusion with the claimants registered a false case against

answering respondent Nos. 1 and 2 i.e. driver and owner of truck bearing

No. HR 69B 3693.
</p>
<p id="p_9">            To substantiate averments raised in para 24 of claim

application and discharge onus of issue No. 1 with regard to occurrence

being the result of rash and negligent driving of offending Truck, the

claimants examined Constable Mahesh Kumar.

             The Rules of the Road Regulations 1989 were framed by the

Central Government in exercise of the powers conferred by <a href="/doc/1748744/" id="a_4">Section 118</a> of

the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. Regulation 23 of the Rules deals with

distance from vehicles in front. A relevant extract therefrom reads as

follows:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">                "23. Distance from vehicles in front:- The driver of a
                motor vehicle moving behind another vehicle shall
                keep at a sufficient distance from that other vehicle to
                avoid collision if the vehicle in front should suddenly
                slow down or stop"</blockquote><p id="p_12">

</p><p id="p_13">             Regulation 24 provides for abrupt brake and says that no

driver of a vehicle shall apply brake abruptly unless it is necessary to do so

for safety reasons.
</p>
<p id="p_14">             Hon'ble the Supreme Court in Nishan Singh's case (supra), in

concluding lines of para 10 has held, quoted thus:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">              "The expression 'sufficient distance' has not been
              defined in the Regulations or elsewhere. The thumb rule
              of sufficient distance is at least a safe distance of two to
              three seconds gap in ideal conditions to avert collision
              and to allow the following driver time to respond. The
              distance of 10-15 feet between the truck and maruti
              car was certainly not a safe distance for which the
              driver of the maruti car must take the blame. It must
              necessarily follow that the finding on the issue under
              consideration ought to be against the claimants.</blockquote><p id="p_15">

</p><p id="p_16">             Reverting to case at hand, the claimants examined Mahesh

Kumar Constable 1086/PPT to discharge onus of issue No. 1. He tendered

into evidence his duly sworn affidavit Ex.PW2/A in Hindi. A relevant

extract therefrom, translated in English, reads as under:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">                 "......At that time, a truck bearing No. HR 69B
                 3696 driven at a fast speed in a rash and negligent
                 manner came from the side of Panipat and behind
                 the truck, Maruti Car bearing No. DL 6CK 0998
                 was coming. In the meantime, the aforesaid truck
                 abruptly applied brakes and Maruti car went
                 underneath the truck and car driver sustained
                 multiple injuries. When car driver was taken out
                 of the car, he had already died.</blockquote><p id="p_17">

</p><p id="p_18">            The witness was crossed examined at length by the contesting

respondents before the Tribunal. Nothing was asked from Constable

Mahesh Kumar as to the distance between Truck and Maruti Car much less

that driver of Maruti Car was not maintaining sufficient distance from the

Truck going ahead in order to bring home contention of the insurance

company that either driver of Maruti Car is to be blamed for the accident or

he can be attributed contributory negligence for the occurrence. Not only

this, driver of offending vehicle did not appear in the witness box to

explain the circumstances under which the occurrence in question took

place. There are no materials on record to substantiate plea of the insurance

company (though the same is otherwise beyond pleadings) that the accident

happened due to failure of driver of Maruti Car to maintain sufficient

distance from the Truck going ahead. This apart, driver and owner of

offending vehicle did not raise any such plea that occurrence in question

took place because of mistake on the part of driver of Maruti Car or the

present is a case of contributory negligence of the deceased. In this view of

the matter, the insurance company can neither derive any advantage to its

</pre><p id="p_21">              The plea of claimants is that the deceased was working with

Luxmi Remote (India) Private Limited and his salary was Rs.24,780.00 per

month. Vikas Jain, Senior Executive Accountant PW3 from Luxmi Remote

(India) Private Limited was examined and he proved documents Ex.P1 to

P7 and also proved documents Marked 'A' to 'C'. The Tribunal, on

consideration of the documents produced by Vikas Jain (PW3) has

recorded its conclusion that income of the deceased is Rs.16,493.00 per

month for the purpose of assessing compensation.

</p><p id="p_22">              As per salary certificate Ex.P1 for the month of April, 2009,

the deceased got salary of Rs.24,000.00, out of which an amount of

Rs.780.00 was deducted towards the employees' provident fund.

According to certificate Ex.P2, basic salary of deceased for the month of

April 2009 was Rs.6,500.00, special allowance Rs.12,600.00, medical

allowance Rs.1,250.00, transport allowance Rs.800.00 and House Rent

Allowance Rs.2,850.00. An amount of Rs.780.00 was deducted towards

provident fund. However, document mark 'A' shows that for the month of

March 2009, the deceased got salary of Rs.18,073.00, out of which

Rs.780.00 were deducted as contribution towards employees' provident

fund. In the said document, there is no reference to special allowance of

Rs.12,600.00 and, as such, the Tribunal has held that the deceased was not

getting a fixed salary every month and he was getting special allowance

also in some months and it appears that the payment of special allowance

depended upon profits of the company.             Accordingly, the Tribunal

considered salary of the deceased at Rs.17,293.00 per month and by

deducting Rs.800.00 towards transportation allowance, Rs.16,493.00 were

taken into consideration for computing loss of dependency.           Even if

findings of the Tribunal are accepted on its face value that special

allowance was not available to the deceased every month, the claimant

cannot be denied benefit of special allowance for the months it was

allowed. In the given scenario, interest of justice would be served if loss of

dependency is computed by taking into consideration average gross salary

in the months of March and April, 2009. Accordingly, loss of dependency

is calculated at Rs.21,000.00 per month. After deducting lability to pay

income tax i.e. Rs.9,200.00, annual loss of dependency is Rs.2,42,800.00

(Rs.2,52,000-Rs.9,200.00).

in income for future prospects at the rate of 40%.

three minor children and mother of the deceased. Taking into consideration

number of dependents on income of the deceased, deduction for personal

expenses would be 1/4th. In view of the above, loss of dependency is

calculated at Rs.38,24,100.00 (Rs.36,42,000.00 i.e. Rs.2,42,800 x 15 +

Rs.14,56,800.00 (40% addition) - Rs.12,74,700.00 (deduction 1/4th)).
