            IN THE HIGH COURT OF PUNJAB &amp; HARYANA
                       AT CHANDIGARH

                                          RSA No.2977 of 2015 (O&amp;M)
                                          Date of decision:23.01.2019

Mukhtiar Singh and others                                        ... Appellants

                           Vs.

Mahender Singh (deceased) through LRs and others           ...   Respondents</pre>

<p id="p_1">CORAM: HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE AMIT RAWAL

Present:-    Mr. S.R.Hooda, Advocate
             for the appellants.
</p>
<p id="p_2">AMIT RAWAL J. (Oral)

             The present regular second appeal is directed against the

concurrent findings of fact and law, whereby, suit of the appellant-plaintiffs

claiming declaration and ownership of suit land with regard to estate of

Baljit Singh by laying challenge to the mutation dated 29.2.1964, Ex.P14,

has been dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_3">             It was alleged that Baljit Singh was not known for the last more

than 07 years and on the basis of death, revenue officer entered the mutation

in favour of defendants, whereas, plaintiffs were also co-lateral.

</p><p id="p_4">             In support of the averments, plaintiffs examined numerous

witnesses and brought on record the mutation. The defendants also led the

evidence and it has come on record that in the year 1992, some part of the

land was acquired and Baljit Singh himself claimed compensation.

</p><p id="p_5">             Mr. S.R.Hooda, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the

appellant-plaintiffs submitted that there was presumption of death of Baljit

Singh as per the provisions of <a href="/doc/985205/" id="a_1">Section 108</a> of Indian Evidence Act. The

 RSA No.2977 of 2015 (O&amp;M)                                  {2}

mutation could not have been entered in favour of the defendants being co-

lateral as the plaintiffs were denied the right of inheritance being also co-

lateral. PW4-Amar Patwari also proved that on 09.04.1992, the land was

acquired vide award and Baljit Singh had received a sum of Rs.5,40,632.15

paise on identification of Attar Singh, Numberdar. In such circumstance,

mutation could not have been sanctioned and the suit was liable to be

decreed.
</p>
<p id="p_6">             I am afraid the aforementioned argument is not sustainable, for,

once the plaintiffs' witnesses disclosed the fact that Baljit Singh was alive in

the year 1992 and received the compensation of Rs.5,40,632.15 paise, the

presumption of death of Baljit Singh as per the provisions of <a href="/doc/985205/" id="a_2">Section 108</a> of

Indian Evidence Act, could not have been believed. No decree or any

evidence has been led on record to establish that he was not heard and

deemed to have died. The pleadings and testimony of the witness of PW4,

are totally different. If at all, Baljit Singh was alive, he could have cause of

action to assail the mutation. It still remained mystery whether Baljit Singh

after 1992 was alive nor not. The findings of fact and law cannot be said to

be suffering from illegality and perversity in a suit filed in the year 2007.

</p><p id="p_7">             No ground for interference is made out.
</p>
<p id="p_8">             Resultantly, the appeal is dismissed.</p><pre id="pre_2">
