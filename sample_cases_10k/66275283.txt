     Jalgaon, below the application for interim relief Exhibit U/2, the order of

              adjudication by the Tribunal under the <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_2">Industrial Disputes Act</a>. In
              the said case the employer dismissed the workman for disobeying
              the orders of the managing authority. The workman filed an




                                                     
              application before the Industrial Tribunal under <a href="/doc/365858/" id="a_3">Section 33-A</a> of the
              Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 contesting his dismissal on various
              grounds, whereupon the Tribunal passed an order to the effect that




                                          
              as an interim measure the workman be permitted to work and if the

              date he reported for duty. The employer challenged the order of the
              Tribunal by filing a writ petition before the High Court which was
                            
              dismissed. On appeal by a certificate of the High Court it was held
              that the order of reinstatement could not be given as an interim
              relief because that would be giving the employee the very relief
      

              which he would get if order of dismissal is not found to be justified.
              Order passed by the Tribunal was held to be manifestly erroneous
   



              and set aside. It was observed:

                       amount to giving the respondent at the outset the relief
                       to which he would be entitled only if the employer
                       failed in the proceedings under <a href="/doc/365858/" id="a_4">Section 33-A</a>. As was





                       pointed out in Hotel Imperial's case (1959) IILLJ 544 SC,
                       ordinarily, interim relief should not be the whole relief
                       that the workmen would get if they succeeded finally.
                       The order therefore of the Tribunal in this case allowing
                       reinstatement as an interim relief or in lieu thereof
                       payment of full wages is manifestly erroneous and must

              has granted final relief to the respondent No. 1 by directing the

              the High Court was not justified in granting such interim order at
              the admission stage. It is an admitted position that the second





              appeal was admitted for final disposal. A suit was filed by the

     from the above referred reports, it is virtually prohibited to grant interim

     relief in the form of a final relief. This is more intense in the matters in




                                         
     which a domestic enquiry has been conducted and fairness of the enquiry

              departmental/domestic enquiry was already held against him by the
              petitioner employer at which it was concluded that the charges are
              proved. The Enquiry Officer, after such a conclusion was recorded by




                                         
              him in his report, forwarded it to the employer and the employer
              acting on the same has dismissed the respondent from service with
                             
              effect from 25th November 2002. The employee sought a reference
              from the Appropriate Government and that is how the matter of his
                            
              dismissal is referred to the Labour Court and that is how the Court
              is seized of the matter. The Court cannot be equated with an
              employer as it is only performing a judicial function of giving an
      

              opportunity to the petitioner to adduce evidence to prove charges of
              misconduct before it, and that is because the law postulates such an
   



              opportunity. The law does not equate this situation with suspension
              by the employer pending domestic enquiry or investigation into any
              complaints. The Supreme Court decision cannot be extended by





              analogy to such a situation as that would produce startling
              consequences. In all such matters merely because the Court grants
              the employer an opportunity to adduce evidence to prove the
              charges of misconduct, it will be obliged to direct the employer to





              pay subsistence allowance to the employee. That would mean that
              the order of dismissal already passed against the employee is set
              aside and substituted by his suspension. That would be creating a
              situation wherein the order of the Court permitting de novo enquiry
              means an order of suspension of the employee enabling him to claim
              subsistence allowance. If the charges of misconduct are grave and
              serious and the employee is already dismissed, then, paying him any

                       dealing with industrial matters, it does not adopt a
                            
                       doctrinaire approach and refuses to yield blindly to abstract
                       notions, but adopts a realistic and pragmatic approach. It,
                       therefore, endeavours to resolve the competing claims of
      

                       employers and employees by finding a solution which is just
                       and fair to both parties with the object of establishing
   



                       harmony between capital and labour, and good relationship.
                       The ultimate object of industrial adjudication is to help the
                       growth and progress of national economy and it is with that





                       ultimate object in view that industrial disputes are settled by
                       industrial adjudication on principles of fair-play and justice.
                       That is the reason why on several occasions, industrial
                       adjudication has thought it fit to make reasonable provision





                       for leave in respect of the workmen who may not strictly fall
                       within the purview of the <a href="/doc/1955064/" id="a_5">Factories Act</a> or the Shops and
                       Commercial Establishments Act. We are, therefore, satisfied
                       that there is no substance in the grievance made by Mr.
                       Pathak that the labour Appellate Tribunal should not have
                       granted the demand of the respondents for leave on grounds
                       of fair play and social justice.'

<p id="p_22">     16.      In the light of the above, this petition deserves to be allowed. The

     impugned orders dated 2.1.2014 passed by the Labour court in Complaint




                                                   
     (ULP) No. 21 of 2013 and the judgment of the Industrial Court dated

     20.6.2014 in Revision (ULP) No. 3 of 2014 are quashed and set aside. The




                                          
     Labour Court, Jalgaon is directed to frame all issues in the light of the

     contentions of the rival sides and deal with the issues pertaining to the
                             
     fairness of the enquiry and the fairness of the findings of the Enquiry
                            
     Officer as preliminary issues so as to constitute its Part I order. In this

     backdrop, the Revision (ULP) No.3 of 2014 does not survive and is therefore,

     disposed off.
</p>      
   



<p id="p_23">     17.      It is made clear that the Labour Court shall follow the procedure laid

     down in law, which has been considered in the MSRTC Beed case (supra).
</p>




<p id="p_24">     So also, in the event, the domestic enquiry is set aside for any reason

     whatsoever, the issue of conducting a de novo enquiry shall be considered

     by the Labour Court strictly in accordance with the judgment of the Apex





     Court in the case of KSRTC Vs. Laxmidevamma (supra).
</p>


<p id="p_25">     18.      It be noted that the quashing of the impugned orders shall not

     indicate that this Court has formed an opinion about the fairness of the

     enquiry and findings of the Enquiry Officer.

     this Court in the case of Maharashtra State Cooperative Cotton Growers

     Marketing Federation Ltd. and another          Vs. Vasant Ambadas Deshpande

     [2014 I CLR 878 = 2014(3) Mh.L.J.339], the Labour Court shall deal with the




                                                    
     said issues on their own merits and in accordance with law. The domestic

     enquiry papers are germane for decision on these two issues and as such the




                                        
     petitioner / employer shall produce the entire enquiry Officer's file ( R &amp; P
                             
     of the enquiry) before the Labour Court, within the period of six weeks

     from today and supply copy thereof to the complainant - employee.

<p id="p_28">     20.      It is expected that the litigating sides will cooperate with the Labour
      

     Court and the adjournments sought on frivolous unreasonable grounds will

     be refused.

<p id="p_29">     21.      The petition is, therefore, allowed. Rule is made absolute in the





     above terms.
