ORAL
JUDGMENT</pre> 

 
	  

<p id="p_1">Present
	petitioner-original plaintiff filed Special Summary Suit No.690 of
	2009 before the Civil Court Vadodara against the present
	respondent-original defendant for recovery of Rs.11,30,122/- with
	interest @ 18% p.a. from the date of delivery of goods till date of
	recovery. On summons being served, the respondent filed an
	application for leave to defend the suit under Order 37 Rule 5 of
	the Code of Civil Procedure. Subsequently, the plaintiff filed a
	purshis at Ex.30 in said suit declaring that he is abandoning his
	prayer qua interest. The defendant raised objection by making
	endorsement below the purshis to the effect that after filing of the
	suit, the plaintiff  cannot abandon his claim as there is no
	provision in the Civil Procedure Code for amending the claim by
	filing purshis.
</p>	  

<p id="p_2">After
	hearing the arguments of both the learned advocates appearing for
	the respective parties, Trial Court passed order on 30-3-2010 that
	purshis which is filed at Ex.30 on 18-3-2010 is not accepted at that
	stage, which is impugned in the present petition.
</p>	  

<p id="p_3">Heard
	learned advocates, Mr.H.A.Dave, for the petitioner and
	Mr.P.P.Majmudar for the respondent. 
</p>	
	  

<p id="p_4">It
	is submitted by Mr.Dave that parties to the suit cannot be
	restrained from making declaration by way of filing purshis to the
	effect of abandoning certain claim. The plaintiff has only made a
	declaration by purshis Ex.30 and no order could have been passed
	below the said purshis. He placed reliance upon AIR 2004 Bombay
	page 186 in the case of SICOM Ltd. Vs. Prashant S.Tanna and
	Others wherein it has been held  as under:
</p>	 

<p id="p_5">"In
	a summary suit filed under O.37 the plaintiff is entitled at any
	time to abandon or give-up a part of the claim unilaterally. This,
	the plaintiff may do by making a statement to be recorded by the
	Court and without the necessity of the plaintiff making a formal
	application for the same by withdrawing the summons for judgment,
	amending the plaint and thereafter taking out a fresh summons for
	judgment or otherwise."
</p>	 


	  

<p id="p_6">It
	is submitted by Mr.Majmudar that by filing the purshis, the
	plaintiff cannot abandon his claim as suit is filed under the
	provisions of Order 37 Rule 4 of Code of Civil Procedure as a
	summary suit. It is further submitted that by abandoning the claim
	by filing purshis, the plaintiff intended to frustrate the right of
	defense of the defendant and summary suit is not maintainable as far
	as relief of interest is concerned. He further submits that matter
	was kept for hearing of leave to defend application and the
	defendant has completed his arguments. Subsequently thereafter,
	purshis at Ex.30 has been filed only with an ulterior motive of
	defeating the interest of the defendant and hence, Trial Court has
	rightly rejected the purshis and no error of jurisdiction has been
	committed in the same and, hence, the present petition requires to
	be dismissed. He has placed reliance on the case of <a href="/doc/1267450/" id="a_1">Pratapbhai
	V.Trivedi Vs. Priyavadu @ Ghanu Pratapbhai Trivedi</a> reported
	in 1992(2) GLH page 414. 
</p>	
	  

<p id="p_7">Taking
	into consideration the rival contentions of the parties, it is an
	admitted fact that the present petitioner-original plaintiff has
	filed purshis on 18-3-2010 declaring that he is abandoning his claim
	of interest. This is only a declaration and, therefore, Court ought
	not to have passed order on the said declaration i.e. purshis. As no
	application has been filed by the present petitioner, there was no
	question of passing any order below the purshis. It has been held by
	this Court in AIR 2004 Gujarat page 221 in the case of Nila
	Bauart Engineering Ltd. Vs. Rajasthan Urban Infrastructure Project
	and Others  as under:
</p>	 


<p id="p_8">	"As
	a rule of prudence and to protect the miscarriage of justice, the
	Court can expect that such a request is expressed in writing. The
	withdrawal purshis placed before the Court is only required to be
	recorded and no formal order on withdrawal purshis is necessary.
	Formal order treating the plaint as disposed of on account of wish
	to withdraw the suit, is a formality and that formal order can be
	passed below the plaint, can be passed at any time by the Presiding
	Officer of the Court being a mere formality."
</p>	 


	
	  


<p id="p_9">	This
	Court totally agrees and it is the right of the plaintiff to forgo
	certain claim of the suit at any time. However, the Trial Court
	ought not to have passed any order on the purshis. Having passed
	such an order on the pursis, the impugned order requires to be
	quashed and set aside. 
</p>	
	  


<p id="p_10">	Under
	the circumstances, order dated 30-3-2010 passed by the learned Civil
	Judge, Vadodara, below Ex.30 in Special Summary Suit No.690 of 2009
	is quashed and set aside and order is hereby passed below Ex.30 to
	the effect as "recorded". While deciding the leave to
	defend application, the respondent-original defendant has right to
	raise all contentions. This petition is accordingly allowed. Rule is
	made absolute. Direct service is permitted. In view of the above,
	Civil Application No.12172 of 2010 stands disposed of.
</p>
