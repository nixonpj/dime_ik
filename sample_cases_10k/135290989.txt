      *****************************************************
                 W.P.(C) No.2437 of 2015
      *****************************************************
          Dated this the 19th day of March, 2015

                     JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">     The petitioner was appointed in the post of Assistant

Professor in Physics pursuant to a notification issued by the

College concerned.     The selection committee consists of

Government nominee, subject expert and other Officials as

mandated under the relevant regulations of the Mahatma

Gandhi University Act. This appointment was with effect

from 12.7.2013.
</p>
<p id="p_2">     2.   The College made a statement of workload as on

1.11.2012 based on the students strength of the previous

year. This workload would clearly indicate that the total

workload is 139 hours and number of posts admissible is

nine. The petitioner is appointed in 9th post. The workload

statement is produced as Ext.P10(b). The University did not

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">W.P.(C) No.2437 of 2015              2</span>



approve the appointment.              Thus,    the petitioner has

approached this Court.
</p>
<p id="p_3">        3.    The stand of the University is that they did not verify

the workload submitted by the College as per Ext.P10(b). The

case of the University is that based on the Government Order

dated 18.12.2012,        the staff fixation as well as the workload

has to be fixed by the Government and therefore, the University

is not in a position to approve the appointment.

</p><p id="p_4">        4.    The learned Standing Counsel submits that the

Government Order is remain unchallenged before this Court

and therefore, the University is not bound to approve the

appointment.
</p>
<p id="p_5">        5.    The approval of appointment is governed by the

<a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_1">University Act</a> and the Statutes. Section 23 of Mahatma Gandhi

University Act refers the power of the Syndicate,             which

includes the power to approve the appointment of teachers in

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">W.P.(C) No.2437 of 2015               3</span>



private colleges. Statute 16 of Chapter 45 of the Mahatma

Gandhi University Statutes, 1997 (for short, the 'University

Statutes') also covers provisions for approval of appointment.

</p><p id="p_6">        6.    Statute 16 of the University Statutes, which reads as

follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">            "16. Approval of appointment:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">            (1)Approval of every appointment to the

                teaching post shall be made by the Syndicate

                subject   to    the   conditions      that   the

                appointment is in accordance with the staff

                pattern fixed by the University and that the

                person so appointed is fully qualified for the

                post.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">            (2)The Deputy Director of Collegiate Education

                concerned shall verify before making direct

                payment of salaries as to whether the post for

                which payment is claimed is in accordance

                with the staff pattern and workload fixed by

                the University.    Doubtful cases shall be

                referred to the University for clarification and

                the correctness of direct payment ensured.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">W.P.(C) No.2437 of 2015               4</span>



            (3) In the case of those private colleges coming

                under the Direct payment Scheme, the

                Director of Collegiate Education or the Officer

                authorised by him in this behalf shall verify in

                consultation with the University as to

                whether the teaching post in private colleges

                are in excess of the posts sanctioned by the

                University.  However,     in   the   case     of

                incumbents declared as supernumeraries by

                the University, the controlling officers shall

                ensure that no fresh appointment is made

                against  future    vacancies  until    all  the

                supernumeraries are absorbed against those

                vacancies. The direct payment of salaries shall

                not be made to the person appointed against

                fresh vacancies, before the absorption of

                supernumeraries."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_7">Statute 16 of the University Statutes would go to show that the

University has bounden duty to fix the staff pattern and verify

the qualification for the post.
</p>
<p id="p_8">        7.    The power referrable to the Government is through

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">W.P.(C) No.2437 of 2015        5</span>



the Deputy Director of Collegiate Education is only to verify

whether the approval of appointment of the staff pattern and

the workload fixed by the University is correct or not. When

statutory provisions are clear and     abundant showing the

duties and responsibilities of the University, a Government

Order cannot divest such statutory power of the University.

The Government Order can only be read down to understand

that it was issued in order to avoid further issue and delay in

the matter of payment of salary, the staff fixation could be

verified by the Additional Secretary to the Government.    But

that does not take away the power of the University. Any

constitution of Apex Committee consists of the Principal

Secretary or such other member would not take away the

University's power to fix the staff fixation and approve the

appointment in accordance with law. The University cannot

take shelter under the Government Order to claim that the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">W.P.(C) No.2437 of 2015               6</span>



Government is the authority to fix the staff fixation and the

workload in the College.
</p>
<p id="p_9">        8.      I am of the view, notwithstanding the Government

Order as above, the University is bound to undertake their

statutory obligations in terms of Statute 16 read with Section

23 of the Mahatma Gandhi University Act. In view of the long

delay involved in the matter and taking note of workload

statement, the petitioner shall be approved forthwith

provisionally. There is no dispute regarding qualification of the

petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_10">         Therefore, the writ petition is disposed of with the

following orders:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">         1.     In view of the matter that the appointment was

                made as early as in the year 2012,         the

                University shall approve the appointment of the

                petitioner provisionally based on the statement

                given by the College as per Ext.P10(b).

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">W.P.(C) No.2437 of 2015                7</span>



</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">         2.     It is open for the University to verify the

                statement and find out any discrepancy and the

                University shall make every endeavour to fix the

                staff fixation in accordance with the relevant

                provisions of law.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">         3.     While working out the actual workload in the

                College, the relevant syllabus that applicable

                shall also be taken note by the University for

                staff fixation.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_7">         4.     The petitioner shall be paid current month

                salary onwards.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_8">         5.    The payment of salary will be subject to outcome

                of enquiry and verification in relation to the

                workload.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_9">         6.    The enquiry and verification as mentioned above

                shall be completed within three months.
