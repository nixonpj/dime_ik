<p id="p_1">JUDGMENT
 

Farooq Hassan, J.
</p> 

<p id="p_2">1. The petitioner, a registered partnership firm, carrying on the business of cutting and processing of marbles at Makarana, District Nagpur, was informed by the Regional Provident Fund Commissioner, Jaipur (respondent No. 2), by his letter dated 7th December, 1965, that the Employees' Provident Funds and <a href="/doc/269107/" id="a_1">Miscellaneous Provisions Act</a>, 1952 (for brevity "the P.F. Act"), and the scheme framed thereunder have been made applicable to the petitioner's business and further that, on making inquiries, the petitioner's establishment revealed to come under the scheduled head "Electrical, Mechanical and General Engineering Products". Therefore, under the aforesaid letter (annexure 1), the petitioner was directed to deduct provident fund contribution from the wages of the eligible employees with effect from September, 1965 onwards. The petitioner contested the direction issued under annexure 1, and in its reply (annexure 2) to that, it stated that the <a href="/doc/1724879/" id="a_2">Provident Funds Act</a> was not applicable to its establishment because the strength of employees in the establishment was less than 20 persons, that they did not manufacture and produce any engineering products and, therefore, the coverage under the head "Engineering and Engineering Products" does not arise and it is not covered by Schedule I to the <a href="/doc/1724879/" id="a_3">Provident Funds Act</a>; and that the Provident Fund Commissioner has wrongly counted the casual workers among the employees of its establishment in order to cover it in the scheme wrongly.
</p> 

<p id="p_3">2. The petitioner also moved the Secretary, Labour Department of the Government of India, under <a href="/doc/1724879/" id="a_4">Section 19A</a> of the Provident Funds Act, and submitted that its department is not engaged in manufacturing electrical, mechanical and general engineering products as mentioned in Schedule I to the <a href="/doc/1724879/" id="a_5">Provident Funds Act</a>, that their main work is only of manufacturing marble products and cutting with processing of marble, and, therefore, such sort of work cannot be categorisd under Schedule I to the <a href="/doc/1724879/" id="a_6">Provident Funds Act</a> and the coverage, as reported by respondent No. 2, is arbitrary, wrong and against the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1724879/" id="a_7">Provident Funds Act</a>, and that the petitioner has not ever employed more than 20 employees.
</p> 

<p id="p_4">3. The Under Secretary to the Government of India by his letter dated 1st February, 1968 (annexure 4), informed the petitioner that its establishment has been engaged in producing marble chips and tiles, there were 23 employees in the month of August, 1965, "piowala", cart driver and gardener were included as being engaged in the manufacturing process, and, therefore, according to the respondents, the establishment of the petitioner was treated to be coverable under the head "Electrical, Mechanical and General Engineering Products". Hence, the petitioner was directed to submit their viewpoint within thirty days of receipt of the said letter (annexure 4).
</p> 

<p id="p_5">4. Again, though the petitioner reiterated the same stand as has been taken before respondent No. 2 and the Secretary, yet it has also taken additional plea to the effect that its factory has not been engaged in manufacturing tiles and, as such, is not coverable under the Schedule "tiles", and denied the fact of 23 persons having been employed in the establishment on any day, and, according to the petitioner, the strength has always been below 20.
</p> 

<p id="p_6">5. Therefore, the Legal Adviser, Ministry of Labour, to the Government of India, under his order dated 1st March, 1977 (annexure 6), held that the petitioner's establishment did not fall within the entry "electrical, mechanical and general products' but was covered by "saw mills" and, therefore, its establishment should be classified under entry 66 "saw mills" of the Schedule because this entry covered even the saw mills engaged in cutting stones (this entry of saw mills was added to the Schedule by notification dated 7th September, 1962 (See (1962-63) 23 IFJ (St) 49), with effect from 31st October, 1962) coupled with arriving at the finding that the petitioner's establishment had engaged more than 20 employees at the relevant time including casual labourers who were included within the definition of "employee" of the establishment.
</p> 

<p id="p_7">6. It has been contended by the petitioner in the writ petition that the aforesaid decision (annexure 6) has been taken behind its back and so, the orders should be termed as ex-parte, and, in these circumstances, the petitioner alleged that the decision (annexure 6) is without jurisdiction, illegal and contrary to law.
</p> 

<p id="p_8">7. It is also the case of the petitioner that against the aforesaid decision, the petitioner again submitted representation in detail to the Central Government for consideration of the matter but the representation was not considered and no reply has so far been received by the petitioner. And, in pursuance of the order dated 1st March, 1977 (annexure 6), respondent No. 2, Commissioner, has been proceeding under Section 7(a) of the PF Act for determination of money dues payable by the petitioner from 7th September, 1965, and further pressing hard on the petitioner to pay the provident fund dues, as is the case of the petitioner in the writ petition.
</p> 

<p id="p_9">8. According to the petitioner, the Central Government, vide Notification No. GSR 204, dated 31st January, 1977 (See (1977)50 IFJ (St) 155), published in the Gazette of India, Part 11, <a href="/doc/1010442/" id="a_8">Section 3(i)</a>, dated 12th February, 1977, at page 567, further specified the establishment mentioned in the Schedule to the PF Act as item "Stone quarries producing stone chips, stone sets, stone boulders and ballasts".
</p> 

<p id="p_10">9. Aggrieved against the aforesaid action of the respondents, the petitioner has filed this writ petition with the prayer to quash the orders (annexure 1 and annexure 6) and declaring that the petitioner's establishment did not come under Schedule I to the PF Act and, therefore, the provident fund contribution, as required by the PF Act, is not liable to be deposited by the petitioner.
</p> 

<p id="p_11">10. The first and foremost contention on behalf of the petitioner while drawing our attention to the entry, S. No. 13 of Appendix I, attached to the PF Act, is that the Legal Adviser, Ministry of Labour, Government of India, under the impugned order (annexure 6) failed to consider that the establishments which are engaged in the processing or treatment of wood including "saw mills" can be covered by the aforesaid entry, S. No. 13. Learned counsel added that since the process of or treating of wood is essential for covering the establishment under the aforesaid entry and as the petitioner has not been doing any work of processing or treating of wood, its establishment cannot be covered under the said Appendix I. Therefore, learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the Legal Adviser has committed an illegality in holding that the petitioner's establishment comes within the definition of "saw mills".
</p> 

<p id="p_12">11. Before we deal with the aforesaid contention, a reference to the relevant entry, S. No. 13 of Appendix I, attached to the <a href="/doc/1724879/" id="a_9">Provident Funds Act</a> would be advantageous. Appendix I to the <a href="/doc/1724879/" id="a_10">Provident Funds Act</a> is a list of non-factory industries to which the Employees' Provident Funds and <a href="/doc/269107/" id="a_11">Miscellaneous Provisions Act</a>, 1952, has been made applicable under <a href="/doc/495496/" id="a_12">Section 1(3)(b)</a>. At SI. No. 13, to which learned counsel for the petitioner has drawn our attention (which has been made effective with effect from 31st October, 1962, vide Notification No. G.S.R. 1232, dated 7th September, 1962 (See (1962-63) 23 IFJ (St) 49), Gazette of India, dated 1st May, 1962, Part II, <a href="/doc/1010442/" id="a_13">Section 3(i)</a>, page 1341), it has been mentioned as under:

</pre><p id="p_14">12. Having browsed through the afore-extracted part of Appendix I and persued the writ petition of the petitioner, we are of the view that the contention, which was put in the forefront by learned counsel for the petitioner, is not tenable and we are unable to accept it. The petitioner, in its representation dated 30th
 July, 1966 (annexure 3), addressed to the Secretary, Labour Department, made under <a href="/doc/1724879/" id="a_15">Section 19-A</a> of the Provident Funds Act, has, itself, stated that its factory is not engaged in the manufacture of electrical, mechanical and general engineering products, and its manufacturing work is only sawing and manufacturing of chips which, according to the petitioner, are not included in electrical and mechanical products and are also not produced as specified in Appendix I of the Provident Funds Act. It is thus clear that the petitioner in its aforesaid representation itself admitted the character of their establishment and it was alleged to be "saw mill". In view of this clear admission, we are of the opinion that the petitioner cannot go beyond its admission and even in the absence of any assertion on behalf of the department claiming the establishment of the petitioner as "saw mill", the establishment of the petitioner could safely be treated as saw mill and, rightly so, by the Legal Adviser. The Chambers' Twentieth Century Dictionary, at page 1202, gives the meaning of "saw' as a toothed cutting instrument. Similarly, the Concise Oxford Dictionary, fifth edition, gives the meaning of "saw" as "an implement usually of steel worked by hand or mechanically and with variously shaped blade or edge having teeth of various forms cut in or attached to it for dividing wood, metal, stone, bone, etc., by reciprocating rotary motion."
</p> 

<p id="p_15">The Webster's New International Dictionary, Volume 2, Second Edition, Unabridged, at page 2224, gives the meaning of "saw" as "a tool or instrument, consisting essentially (usually) of a thin flat blade or plate of tempered steel with a continuous series of teeth on the edge, used for cutting wood, metal, bone, etc."
</p> 

<p id="p_16">The meaning of "saw mill", given in the Oxford Dictionary, is "Driven by water or steam for mechanically sawing."
</p> 

<p id="p_17">On a look at the aforesaid meanings given by the dictionaries, "saw mill" would mean a "saw mill" which is engaged in cutting wood, stone or metal. In this view of the matter, there is no force in the contention that "saw mill", as mentioned at Serial No. 13 of Appendix I, which has been added by the notification dated 7th September, 1962 (See (1962-63) 23 IFJ (St) 49), would mean only a saw mill cutting wood. Confronted, a futile attempt was made by learned counsel for the petitioner in arguing that while issuing the notification by which the entry "saw mill" was added to Appendix I mentioning four other entries, namely, (65), (67), (68) and (69), which, according to the petitioner, pertain to wood, the Government had in mind to give a limited meaning of "saw mill" engaged only in cutting wood. To our mind, there is no basis to draw such a conclusion which the petitioner likes in the aforesaid manner, simply because the entry is wedged between other entries relating to wood. If the intention of the Government was only to include saw mill engaged in cutting wood, it would have expressly stated as saw mills engaged in cutting wood since saw mills engaged in cutting other materials like stone or metal were to be excluded. Since the entry has not been restricted or qualified so as to mean saw mills engaged only in cutting wood, the entry has to be given a sufficiently wide meaning as is understood from the dictionary meaning.
</p> 

<p id="p_18">13. Moreover, the petitioner company itself, in its representation dated 30th June, 1966 (annexure 3), admitted the character of its establishment as saw mill by stating in para 2 that their manufacturing work is only sawing; and further it is not the case of the petitioner that its establishment is engaged in the business of wood and the saw mill is being used for dividing the wood or making it into pieces. Thus, admittedly, the petitioner company is engaged in the business of stone and marbles, and its establishment which has been named by the petitioner itself, as "saw mill", is engaged in cutting the stones and marbles. This is a very significant circumstance to draw an inference that the petitioner's saw mill is covered by entry (66)--saw mills--which was added by notification dated 7th September, 1962 (See (1962-63) 23 IFJ (St) 49), referred to above.
</p> 

<p id="p_19">14. <a href="/doc/1948857/" id="a_16">In Regional Provident Fund Commissioner v. Shibu Metal Works</a> 1965-I-LLJ-473, it has been laid down that the interpretation of an entry should be such which would extend the benefit to a large number of workmen.
</p> 

<p id="p_20">15. Now, we pass on to the next phase of the arguments of learned counsel for the petitioner. In this context, the contention was that the petitioner has not engaged 23 employees in its establishment. We may state that the report of the Provident Fund Inspector dated 17th November, 1965 shows that the petitioner's establishment has been engaged in marble sawing--producing slabs and chips--and had employed nine persons, according to attendance register, eight as per contract register and six more paid through cash book, making a total of 23 employees as in August, 1965. The petitioner has tried to explain this position in its representation that four out of 23 employees are not regular employees but casual employees and, in these circumstances, Shri Salma, Panna Singh, Smt. Kesari and Mewa Ram who were water-cartman, water-server, water-woman and gardener, respectively, are wrongly included treating them as employees by the Inspector, and, according to the petitioner, they cannot be counted as employees for the purposes of covering the establishment under the <a href="/doc/1724879/" id="a_17">Provident Funds Act</a>. Though, in this writ petition, we are not empowered to consider this point as to how many persons were employed at a particular time, because it is a question of fact which cannot be allowed to be agitated before this Court while exercising extraordinary jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_18">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India, in order to meet ends of justice, we would like only to browse through the findings of fact. However, we may observe that respondent No. 2 visited the petitioner's establishment personally and got the statement on 17th November, 1965, showing the details of the number of employees employed by the petitioner and also other particulars duly signed by Shri Mohd. Ramjan, partner of the petitioner's establishment, as is the case of the respondents in their reply to the writ petition. The said statement, which has been annexed to the reply as annexure R. 1, makes the case crystal clear that admittedly the petitioner-company employed more than 23 persons for the purposes of his establishment.
</p> 

<p id="p_21">16. The Legal Adviser, in annexure 6, has elaborately considered the objection taken by the petitioner in its representation with regard to the number of persons employed in the petitioner's establishment. The Legal Adviser, in paras 9, 10, 11 and 12 of the order (annexure 6), has dealt with separately the case of the four employees who are said to have been engaged by the petitioner on casual basis and came to the conclusion that the aforesaid employees ought to have been considered as employees of the petitioner's establishment for which the Legal Adviser has given detailed reasons which cannot be reappreciated making this Court as an appellate forum as we are here in writ forum. And we refrain ourselves from deciding the controversy as to whether the aforesaid employees are casual workers or not and whether they cannot be counted as employees of the establishment of the petitioner.
</p> 

<p id="p_22">17. We are also of the opinion that the authorities concerned have passed the orders after considering the objections of the petitioner and also the provisions of law. A notice was served upon the petitioner for his appearance before the respondents but its representatives failed to attend the hearing of the case.
</p> 

<p id="p_23">18. Thus considered, we hold that the petitioner's establishment comes under the provisions of the Act and, therefore, it is its own duty to deposit the amount and this deposit cannot be said to be a compulsion as is stated in its writ petition.
</p> 

<p id="p_24">19. In view of the foregoing discussions, we do not find any reason to interfere with the findings recorded by the authorities under the <a href="/doc/1724879/" id="a_19">Provident Funds Act</a> warranting interference by this Court under its extra-ordinary jurisdiction.
</p> 

<p id="p_25">20. In the result, we dismiss this writ petition with no order as to costs.
