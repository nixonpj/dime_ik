 MADAN B. LOKUR, ACJ


         The Municipal Corporation of Delhi (the Corporation) is

aggrieved by an order dated 23rd October, 2002 passed by a learned

Single Judge in WP (C) No. 7697/2000. According to the Corporation,

the learned Single Judge erred in directing release of the building plans

of the Respondent even though they were not in conformity with the

building bye-laws. We agree with the Corporation that the building

plans were sanctioned conditionally and the crucial date when the

building plans were considered, the building bye-laws relied upon were

not operative. Therefore, the Corporation had no option but to reject the

building plans submitted by the Respondent.
</p>
<p id="p_8">

</p><p id="p_9">2.       At the outset, we may state that the view canvassed by the

Corporation in the writ petition before the learned Single Judge is quite

different from the view placed before the learned Single Judge in the

review petition and also before us. We have proceeded on the basis of

the view canvassed before the learned Single Judge in the review

petition and also before us.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">LPA No. 268/2003                                               Page 2 of 23</span>
 The facts:
</p>
<p id="p_11">3.      The Respondent is the owner of a plot measuring 1.029

hectares in village Rajokari, Tehsil Vasant Vihar, New Delhi. The

building bye-laws applicable to the area were published by a notification

dated 23rd June, 1983. The Master Plan for Delhi was later amended by

a notification dated 23rd July, 1998 by virtue of which the maximum

coverage and height of dwelling units for farm houses such as that of the

Respondent was increased. However, and this is important, the building

bye-laws were not correspondingly changed or modified in respect of

farm houses, which is what we are concerned with. Learned counsel for

the Corporation submitted, in the alternative, that the legal position

remains the same even if the building bye-laws were modified or

deemed to have been modified.
</p>
<p id="p_12">

</p><p id="p_13">4.      In order to take advantage of the increase offered, the

Respondent submitted an application to the Corporation on or about 17th

April, 2000 for constructing a dwelling unit on its plot as per the norms

laid down in the Master Plan for Delhi (as amended on 23rd July, 1998).

The application contained all the requisite information and documents

and was duly processed by the Corporation.            According to the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">LPA No. 268/2003                                               Page 3 of 23</span>
 Respondent, the site was inspected, the title of the Respondent was

verified and thereafter the building plans were sanctioned on 23 rd May,

2000. The sanction required the Respondent to obtain a No Objection

Certificate from the Land Acquisition Department and deposit the levy

on account of a change in the floor area ratio.
</p>
<p id="p_14">

</p><p id="p_15">5.         It will be noticed from the above that the "sanction" of the

building plans on 23rd May, 2000 was conditional on the Respondent

obtaining a No Objection Certificate as well as depositing the necessary

charges.
</p>
<p id="p_16">

</p><p id="p_17">6.         A No Objection Certificate was applied for by the Respondent

and it was issued by the Additional District Magistrate (Land

Acquisition) on 19th June, 2000 and on the same day the Respondent

says that he deposited the levy.
</p>
<p id="p_18">

The notifications and cause of action:
</p>
<p id="p_19">7.         On 7th June, 2000 the Ministry of Urban Development of the

Government of India published two notifications being S.O. 557(E) and

S.O. 558(E). These notifications were issued before the No Objection


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">LPA No. 268/2003                                              Page 4 of 23</span>
 Certificate was obtained by the Respondent on 19 th June, 2000 but after

the conditional sanction of building plans on 23 rd May, 2000.



</p><p id="p_20">8.      In the first notification being S.O. 557(E) dated 7th June, 2000

the Ministry of Urban Development (Delhi Division) stated that the

building bye-laws stand modified to the extent mentioned in paragraphs

1 to 3 of the annexure to the notification dated 23 rd July, 1998. What we

are concerned with is paragraph 4 of the annexure to the notification

dated 23rd July, 1998. This paragraph concerns itself with the size,

ground coverage, floor area ratio, height etc. of a farm house.

Significantly, the building bye-laws were not modified to incorporate

paragraph 4 of the annexure to the notification dated 23 rd July, 1998.

The Corporation has placed heavy reliance on this fact. We are not

reproducing the contents of the notification dated 23 rd July, 1998 or

paragraph 4 of the annexure thereto, since their relevance is limited only

to the extent mentioned above.
</p>
<p id="p_21">

</p><p id="p_22">9.      The notification S.O. 557(E) notified all concerned that the

building plans to be sanctioned in accordance with the amended

building bye-laws (as amended by paragraphs 1 to 3 of the annexure to


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">LPA No. 268/2003                                                 Page 5 of 23</span>
 the notification dated 23rd July, 1998) would be subject to the provisions

of the layout plans / service plans already sanctioned, and no such

layout / service plans would be amended till arrangements for the

provision of augmented municipal services such as water, power,

sewerage etc have been made. It is important to note that there is no

mention of the sanction of building plans in terms of paragraph 4 of the

annexure to the notification dated 23 rd July, 1998 simply because the

building bye-laws were not modified to incorporate the changes brought

about by the said paragraph 4. This notification S.O. 557(E) dated 7th

June, 2000 reads as follows:

modification was proposed to the Master Plan for Delhi to the effect that

the planning/development control norms for farm houses would revert to

those existing prior to the notification dated 23 rd July, 1998. Objections

were invited to the proposed modification, and the deletion of paragraph

4 of the notification dated 23rd July, 1998 from the Master Plan for

Delhi.     The notification S.O. 558(E) dated 7th June, 2000 reads as

June, 2000 the Ministry of Urban Affairs &amp; Employment informed all

concerned, including the Commissioner of the Corporation, that as

required by Section 483 of the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, 1957,

the Unified Building Bye-laws of 1983 stand modified to the extent as

indicated.   It was clarified that the planning / development control

norms for farm houses in terms of the notification dated 23 rd July, 1998

stand suspended with effect from 7th June, 2000. In other words, the

position as obtaining prior to 23rd July, 1998 would alone be operative

and therefore any building plans submitted for examination and

approval should be considered only in the light of the pre-23rd July,

1998 norms. The communication dated 8th June, 2000 reads as follows:

<p id="p_28">13.        As noted above, it is after these developments that on 19th June,

2000 a No Objection Certificate was issued to the Respondent by the

Additional District Magistrate (Land Acquisition) and the charges

deposited by the Respondent. According to the Respondent the No

Objection Certificate relates back to the sanction dated 23 rd May, 2000

 while according to the Corporation, the No Objection Certificate is

meaningless, since the conditional sanction was null and void or

inoperative since the corresponding building bye-laws for farm houses

were either not amended or if they were amended, then they stood

suspended in view of the two notifications dated 7th June, 2000.



</p><p id="p_29">14.      On 3rd July, 2000 the Respondent was asked to submit fresh

building plans in terms of the two notifications dated 7th June, 2000 read

with the letter dated 8th June, 2000 issued by the Ministry of Urban

Affairs and Employment. A reminder was sent to the Respondent on

18th October, 2000 to the same effect. In the meanwhile, on 7 th August,

2000 the Ministry of Urban Affairs and Employment notified the

amendments to Master Plan for Delhi as proposed on 7th June, 2000

after considering all the objections received.

that the building plans of the Respondent were sanctioned on 23 rd May,

2000 but they were unreasonably not released and so the Respondent

plans.

</p><p id="p_33">16.      The view canvassed by the Corporation before the learned

Single Judge was that in view of the notification dated 7 th August, 2000

reverting the Master Plan for Delhi to the pre-23rd July, 1998 position,

the application of the Respondent for sanction of building plans stood

rejected. The learned Single Judge was of the opinion that since the

building plans were sanctioned on 23rd May, 2000 and all the conditions

were met by the Respondent on 19th June, 2000 there was no reason for

the Corporation to withhold release of the building plans more

particularly since the notification dated 7 th August, 2000 issued by the

Ministry of Urban Affairs and Employment came much after the

conditions were met by the Respondent for sanction of the building

plans.

Submissions and discussion:
</p>
<p id="p_35">17.      Before us, the contention of learned counsel for the

Corporation is two-fold: Firstly, that in fact the building bye-laws were

not amended to bring them in consonance with the Master Plan for


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">LPA No. 268/2003                                              Page 12 of 23</span>
 Delhi as amended on 23rd July, 1998. For this, reliance is placed on

notification S.O. No.557(E) which clearly mentions that the building

bye-laws stand modified to the extent mentioned in paragraphs 1 to 3 of

the annexure to the notification dated 23rd July, 1998. There is no

mention of an amendment to the building bye-laws in terms of

paragraph 4 of the annexure to the notification dated 23 rd July, 1998. As

mentioned above, we are concerned with paragraph 4 of the annexure to

the notification since that deals with farm houses. The contention of

learned counsel for the Corporation was that since the building bye-laws

were not amended, there was no question of the building plans being

sanctioned in accordance with paragraph 4 of the annexure to the

notification dated 23rd July, 1998. Secondly, that in any case, by the two

notifications dated 7th June, 2000 read with the letter of the Ministry of

Urban Affairs and Employment dated 8th June, 2000 there was a brake

or suspension on further sanction of building plans in respect of farm

houses, such as the one that we are concerned with. Thereafter, the pre

23rd July, 1998 building bye-laws became applicable by virtue of the

notification dated 7th August, 2000 once again modifying the Master

Plan for Delhi.

<p id="p_38">19.     A perusal of sub-section (1) of the aforesaid Section shows that

it concerns itself with the grant or deemed grant or refusal of sanction

for the construction of a building. Sub-section (2) deals with a situation

where the building or work is sanctioned (or is deemed to have been


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">LPA No. 268/2003                                               Page 15 of 23</span>
 sanctioned) then the person desirous of making the construction shall be

bound to do so in accordance with the sanction. These two sub-sections

are really not relevant so far as we are concerned. Sub-section (3) deals

with a situation where a person has not commenced construction of the

building within one year of the sanction. In that event, the applicant

must apply for a fresh sanction. Sub-section (4) stipulates that a person

intending to make a construction shall notify the proposed date of

commencement of construction.
</p>
<p id="p_39">

</p><p id="p_40">20.      As far as the present case is concerned, the admitted position is

that the Respondent did not begin the construction [sub-section (3)] nor

did the Respondent give any notice for commencement of construction

at any time [sub-section (4)] after the conditional sanction granted on

23rd May, 2000. Therefore, even if it is assumed that the Respondent

had been sanctioned the building plans, the effect thereof got nullified

with the passage of time because the Respondent neither gave any notice

of commencement of construction nor commenced the construction

within the time prescribed. The Respondent cannot, therefore, claim

any benefit of the conditional sanction.
</p>
<p id="p_41">21.      That apart, the more important question required to be


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">LPA No. 268/2003                                               Page 16 of 23</span>
 answered is whether the Respondent was in fact sanctioned the building

plans on 23rd May, 2000 as claimed and what is the applicable law. In

our opinion, the Respondent was only accorded conditional approval to

the building plans. This cannot be equated with the grant of a sanction.

The conditions imposed on the Respondent were to obtain a No

Objection Certificate from the Additional District Magistrate (Land

Acquisition) and to deposit the levy in accordance with the floor area

ratio.   Until the conditions were met, it cannot be said that the

conditional approval fructified into a sanction.



</p><p id="p_42">22.      That apart, the building plans were not in conformity with the

building bye-laws. It is true that the Master Plan for Delhi was amended

on 23rd July, 1998 but no corresponding change was made in the

building bye-laws. Therefore, even if the building plans submitted by

the Respondent conformed to the Master Plan for Delhi, yet they also

needed to be in accord with the building bye-laws - which they were

not. It is nobody's case that the amendment in the Master Plan for Delhi

as per paragraph 4 of the annexure to the notification dated 23 rd July,

1998 was incorporated in the building bye-laws. In the absence of any

incorporation, the Respondent cannot seek to take advantage of the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">LPA No. 268/2003                                             Page 17 of 23</span>
 relaxed norms mentioned in paragraph 4 of the annexure to the

notification dated 23rd July, 1998. Therefore, the first submission made

on behalf of the Corporation must be accepted and it must be held that

even the conditional sanction given on 23 rd May, 2000 to the building

plans submitted by the Respondent was erroneous because that

conditional sanction was based on the relaxed norms given in paragraph

4 of the annexure to the notification dated 23 rd July, 1998 but those

relaxed norms were not incorporated in the relevant building bye-laws.



</p><p id="p_43">23.     Even if it is deemed that the building bye-laws were suitably

amended on the amendment of the Master Plan for Delhi, the legal

position would not change to the advantage of the Respondent. The

reason for this is that before the No Objection Certificate could be

obtained, the Ministry of Urban Affairs and Employment (Delhi

Division) issued the notifications S.O. 557(E) and S.O. 558(E) both

dated 7th June, 2000 and the letter dated 8 th June, 2000 suspending the

final sanction of the building plans, except in accordance with the norms

that existed prior to 23rd July, 1998. There is no challenge raised by the

Respondent to notification S.O. 557(E) and S.O. 558(E) both dated 7th

June, 2000 or to the letter dated 8th June, 2000. In view of the following


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">LPA No. 268/2003                                               Page 18 of 23</span>
 decisions of the Supreme Court, it must be held that no right had either

accrued or vested in the Respondent to have the plans submitted by it

approved in accordance with the increased coverage and height as they

existed prior to 7th June, 2000. In fact, no right had at all accrued to the

Respondent to have the building plans sanctioned in its favour in

accordance with the 23rd July, 1998 notification, particularly after 7th

June, 2000. At best, it can be argued that the only right that accrued or

even vested in the Respondent was for consideration of its building

plans in accordance with the extant building bye-laws. In other words,

the application submitted by the Respondent could be sanctioned only in

accordance with the building bye-laws as they stood on the date of

consideration and not otherwise. That consideration took place only

after 19th June, 2000 that is after the conditions imposed on 23 rd May,

2000 were met by the Respondent. However, in the meanwhile, the two

notifications dated 7th June, 2000 and the letter dated 8 th June, 2000

were issued.

houses were no longer applicable (assuming they were deemed to be
applicable). Consequently, the Corporation had no option but to reject
the building plans of the Respondent.
</p><p id="p_58">(f)         No right had accrued to the Respondent to proceed on the
basis of the conditional sanction granted to the building plans submitted.
In the absence of any unconditional sanction of building plans, the
question of granting permission to the Respondent to make the
construction did not arise and, indeed, even the Respondent did not ask
for any such permission in terms of Section 337 of the DMC Act.
</p><p id="p_59">(g)        The Corporation was right in law in asking the Respondent to
submit fresh building plans in accordance with the extant building bye-
laws.

</p><p id="p_61"> 30.      Under the circumstances, we are not in agreement with the

learned Single Judge and we hold that the Respondent had only a

conditional sanction for its building plans on 23rd May, 2000. The

conditions were met by the Respondent only on 19 th June, 2000 that is,

after a halt on the application of the amended norms and therefore no

right vested in the Respondent to have its building plans sanctioned on

the presumption that the notification S.O. 557(E) and S.O. 558(E) both

dated 7th June, 2000 did not apply.       The Corporation was right in

requiring the Respondent to submit fresh building plans in terms of their

letters dated 3rd July, 2000 and 18th October, 2000 read with the

notifications dated 7th June, 2000 and the letter dated 8th June, 2000.
