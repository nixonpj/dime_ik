    concerned, the Petitioner No.1 is an Association of Merchants who are carrying 

    on the business in the City of Pune including Shri Chatrapati Shivaji Market

    been allotted Plot No. 604 and has also been issued license in the prescribed 
             


    format.  The Petitioner No.4 has been allotted Plot No.118 in the said Market 
          



    Yard   and   has   similarly   been   issued   a   license.     It   appears   that   the   original 

    licensee i.e. Rajendra Kanhaiyalal Oza and Lalit Mohanlal Dangi have granted 





    Leave and License to one Raju Rashid Bagwan who is the proprietor of one 

    Apna Market wherein a retail trade is being carried out.   The aforesaid plots 





    have been allotted to the Petitioner Nos.2 to 4 by the Market Committee on 

    lease basis. In terms of the Lease Deed the Petitioner Nos.2 to 4 are required to 

    carry out only wholesale trade in agricultural produce in the said plots which 

    are in the Market Yard.  However, it seems that the Petitioners are utilizing the 

    plots on which they have put up the structures for carrying out the retail trade

    order dated 22/12/2014 cancelling the licenses by having recourse to Section

    Petitioners seek to place their reliance to justify carrying on of retail trade, the

    activities   are   not   permissible   in   the   Market   Yard,   the   then   Administrator 

    refused to allow retail trade in grocery etc.  which resulted in a meeting being 
                                 
    held on 02/11/2006 under the Chairmanship of the then Hon'ble Minister for 

    Co-operation, Marketing and Textiles in which meeting apart from the officers 
             


    concerned,   two   local   MLA's   were   also   present.   In   the   said   meeting   it   was 
          



    suggested   that   the   bye-laws   of   the   Respondent   No.4   be   amended   so   as   to 

    provide for retail trade. However, pursuant to the said meeting a proposal for 





    amendment   of   the   bye-laws   was   not   submitted.     However,   under   bye-law 

    46(10) which is presently bye-law 58(10), the Market Committee has power to 





    make   sub-rules   with   prior   consent   of   the   Director   to   permit   in   exceptional 

    circumstances   the   sale   of   commodities   allied   to   agricultural   produce   and 

    related   items.     The   Market   Committee   has   accordingly   made   sub-rules   to 

    permit the sale of the related or allied items.  However, the approval to the said

    Area had been so declared by a notification dated 01/05/1957, pursuant to a 





    declaration that it was intended to regulate the purchase and sale of `gur' in 

    the Market Area. The Bombay Agricultural Produce Markets Act, 1939, was 





    repealed   and   replaced   by   the   Maharashtra   Agricultural   produce   Marketing

    Gultekadi Market Yard was liable to be prosecuted.   The consequence of the 





    notification dated 04/10/1975 and the circular dated 08/10/1975 was that it 

    was   not   permissible   for   anyone   to   carry   on   trade   in   any   of   the   notified 





    agricultural   commodities   outside   the   Gultekadi   Market   Yard   on   and   after 

    14/10/1975.  It meant that traders who were carrying on the business in those 

    commodities  in  Bhavanipeth-Nanapeth  had  perforce   to  move  into  Gultekadi 

    Market Yard if they wanted to stay in the business.  It seems that pursuant to

    the user of the plots in the Market Yard came to be amended so as to provide 




                                                                   
    for the agricultural produce being sold with allied products in the Market Yard 

    in exceptional circumstances.  Hence though the bye-laws did not specifically

    agricultural   produce   but   also   in   cosmetics   etc.     In   fact   in   the   companion

    Petitions in so far as the retail trade is concerned is in lakhs.  It is required to 

    be   noted   that   the   Petitioners   are   not   agriculturists   who   are   seeking   to   sell 





    directly to the consumers. Hence the conclusion that is required to be drawn is 

    that   the   Petitioners   were   also  very   much  aware   that   the   retail   trade   is   not 

    permitted in the plots which are allotted to them in the Market Yard and had 

    therefore   approached   the   State   Government   in   the   year   2006   for   being 

    permitted to carry on the retail trade.  It is required to be borne in mind that

    said   bye-law   was   challenged   on   the   ground   that   the   same   is   ultravires   the 

    provisions of <a href="/doc/192399/" id="a_49">Section 6</a> and <a href="/doc/407759/" id="a_50">Section 61</a> of the said Act. The said challenge was 





    repelled.   The legality of the bye-law was upheld.   However, the issue in the 

    said   case   was   whether   in   the   absence   of   any   quantity   fixed   by   the   Market 





    Committee for retail sale, the sale of livestock and sheep could be said to be 

    wholesale trade and the issue was not as to whether the retail trade could be 

    carried out in the Market Yard.   In my view, for the reasons afore-stated, the 

    Petitioners are  not entitled to carry out retail trade  in  the  Principal Market 

    popularly known as the Gultekadi Market Yard.

    83 out of 512 traders in the jaggery/grocery market amongst whom are the

    formality in view of the fact that the Director of Marketing has by his order 





    dated 04/09/2014 already issued directions to cancel the licenses issued to the 

    Petitioners.   The said submission urged on behalf of the Petitioners has to be 





    viewed in the context of the fact that in carrying on the business of retail trade, 

    the Petitioners in fact were acting illegally as they were not entitled to carry 

    out retail trade in the Market Yard. In any event, in view of the grievance made
