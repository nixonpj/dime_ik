                            BEFORE:

          [ By Sri E.S. Indiresh, HCGP for R1 to 3,
                  Sri Lokesh Kumar for R4 ]

     THIS WRIT PETITION IS FILED UNDER ARTICLES 226 AND
227 OF THE CONSTITUTION OF INDIA, PRAYING TO QUASH THE
ORDER PASSED BY THE R1, DT.17.2.09, AT ANNEXURE-G.

     THIS WRIT PETITION COMING ON FOR PRELIMINARY
HEARING IN 'B' GROUP, THIS DAY, THE COURT MADE THE
FOLLOWING:-

                        ORDER
</pre><p id="p_1">     This writ petition is by a person, who claims that his

father by name Thimmaiah had lost certain agricultural

lands in Sy.No.10/2 of Gorur Village, due to such land

being got sub-merged in the backwaters of Hemavathy

Reservior and in the rehabilitation scheme, the owners of

land, who had lost their land due to submergence, while

an extent of 4 acres of land of block No.42 of Byaba Forest

had been granted to such displaced persons, by mistake

in the grant order dated 11.8.1972 the name of the

original grantee Thammaiah bin Dyavaiah was wrongly

entered as Thammaiah S/o. Thimmayya and as per the

order dated 7.5.1981 the original grantee having lost his
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                             3</span>

grant by way of correction, by a subsequent order dated

17.8.2004 passed by the Special Land Acquisition Officer,

Hemavathi Reservoir Project Rehabilation, Hassan, as the

Special Land Acquisition Officer found that the petitioner

had got the entry corrected by misrepresentation and he

in fact had no claim in respect of lands, which got

submerged    and   there   was   never   any    occasion   to

rehabilitate the petitioner or his father and that order

dated 28.3.2001 (copy at Annexure F) having come to be

affirmed in appeal before the Deputy Commissioner,

Hassan, as per his order dated 17.2.2009 has approached

this court, being aggrieved by these two orders seeking for

quashing the affirming order dated 17.2.2009 of the

Deputy Commissioner ( copy at Annexure - G).


</p><p id="p_2">2.   Notice had been issued to respondents as on

9.10.2009 and an order of status quo was passed.

Subsequently    Government       Advocate      has   entered

appearance for respondent Nos.1 to 3 and Mr. Lokesh
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                    4</span>

Kumar, learned counsel has filed power for respondent

No.4.
</p>
<p id="p_3">
</p><p id="p_4">3.      In the absence of learned counsel for the petitioner, I

have heard Mr. Lokesh Kumar, learned counsel for

respondent No.4 and Mr.E.S. Indiresh, learned HCGP for

respondents Nos.1 to 3.
</p>
<p id="p_5">
</p><p id="p_6">4.      Mr. Lokesh Kumar, learned counsel submits that the

petitioner nor his father had any lands, which got sub-

merged in the Hemavathy Reservoir. The land granted by

way of re-habilitation was not in the name of either the

petitioner    or   his   father,   but   by   mis-representation

petitioner had got his name substituted in the place of

original grantee Thammaiah S/o. Dyavayya and this

mistake had been brought to the notice of the authorities

by the 4th respondent and the 3rd respondent - Special

Land Acquisition Officer by an elaborate order set right

the mistake and on going through the records, the Deputy

Commissioner has affirmed this order in the appeal filed
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                             5</span>

by the petitioner and therefore, there is no occasion for

this court to interfere in the matter and writ petition

deserves to be dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_7">
</p><p id="p_8">5.   Sri E.S. Indiresh, learned HCGP appearing for

respondent Nos.1 to 3 also submits that the revenue

records never indicated that the land of either the

petitioner or his father got submerged in Hemavathi

Reservoir; that the petitioner does not have any right or

claim for grant of land as a displaced person and

therefore, no interference is warranted.   A mistake that

had been occurred in between had been set right after the

authorities have looked into the same and in fact the

petitioner had conceded to this mistake and therefore, no

need for interference.
</p>
<p id="p_9">
</p><p id="p_10">6.   The orders impugned are quite clear about the fact

situation and no occasion for interference. I do not find

any illegality or statutory violation committed by the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                              6</span>

authorities in passing the orders.       No merit in the writ

petition, it is accordingly dismissed.
