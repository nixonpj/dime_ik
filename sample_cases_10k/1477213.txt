ACT:
     Indian  Railway  Establishment  Code,  Rule  1706	(4)-
Railway	 servant   dismissed  after   departmental  enquiry-
dismissal  order  set  aside  by  court-Fresh  charge  sheet
issued-No fresh	 order of  suspension however issued-Railway
servant eventually  dismissed-Railway servant-Whether deemed
to have continued to be under suspension.



HEADNOTE:
     Clause  (1)   of  Rule   1706  of	the  Indian  Railway
Establishment Code  provides for  a  railway  servant  being
placed under  suspension  where	 a  disciplinary  proceeding
against him is contemplated or pending.
     Clause (4)	 of The	 same Rules  provides that  where  a
penalty of  dismissal, removal or compulsory retirement from
service imposed	 upon a	 railway servant  is set  aside by a
decision of  a Court  of Law  and the disciplinary authority
decides to hold a further enquiry, the railway servant shall
be deemed  to have  been  placed  under	 suspension  by	 the
competent authority  from the  date of the original order of
dismissal, removal or compulsory retirement.
     The  Respondent   was  employed  as  an  Assistant	 Sub
Divisional Clerk  in  the  North  Western  Railway.  He	 was
discharged from	 service by  an order  dated 12.4.44. On the
partition of  India. he migrated to India and was taken as a
clerk in  the  Western	Railway.  When	the  fact  that	 the
Respondent had	already been discharged from Railway service
on 12.4.44  came to light, the Respondent was suspended from
service on  17.2.49 and a charge sheet was issued to him for
the misconduct of concealment of the order of discharge, and
after an  enquiry he  was dismissed from service on 14 5.59.
The Respondent filed a suit for a declaration That the order
of discharge  was void. The High Court in Second Appeal held
that the  Respondent was  entitled to a declaration that the
order of  his dismissal	 from service  was  illegal  on	 the
ground that  there was a breach of the principles of natural
justice and  that it  was open to the railway administration
to take	 fresh disciplinary  proceedings from  the stage  at
which the illegality crept in.
     In pursuance  to  the  order  of  the  High  Court	 the
department issued  a  fresh  charge  sheet  against  him  on
14,11.63 and held an inquiry. No fresh order of
938
suspension  was	  however  issued  to  the  respondent.	 The
respondent was	even tually  dismissed from  service  by  an
order dated  23.12.66 with  effect from 14.5.59, the date of
his  original  dismissal.  The	respondent's  writ  petition
challenging the order of dismissal was dismissed by the High
Court.
     After the	dismissal of  the Second  Appeal by the High
Court, the  Respondent moved  the Payment of Wages Authority
on 22.2.63  by a  petition under  section 15  (2) of the Act
claiming wages	for the period from 17.2.49, the date of the
original suspension,  to 22.2.63 less subsistence allowance.
He also	 filed (seven)	petitions once	in every  six months
claiming wages	for the	 period from  1.3.63 to 31.8.66. The
Authority held that the Respondent was entitled to wages for
the period from 17.2.49 to 14.5.49 but the District Judge in
appeal held  that the Respondent was entitled to wages for a
period of  six months  prior to	 25.6.63 r  and also for the
period of  six months  in respect  of each  one of the seven
petitions filed	 by him.  The High Court, however, dismissed
the appellant's	 Civil Revision	 Petition  and	allowed	 the
respondent's  revision	 petition  and	 held  that   the  5
respondent was entitled to receive the arrears of wages from
17.2.49 to 31.8.66.
     In the  appeal to this Court it was contended on behalf
of the Appellant that the Respondent had been suspended from
service on  17.2.49 before  he was originally dismissed from
service on 14.5.49 pursuant to the finding of guilt recorded
in the	departmental inquiry  and  that	 in  the  subsequent
departmental inquiry  he was  found guilty and was therefore
dismissed from	service and  by virtue	of the provisions of
Rule 1706(4)  he must  be deemed  to have  been	 under	sus-
pension right  from 17.2.49  and he  was  only	entitled  to
subsistence allowance  and not	to full wages for the period
from 17.2.49.  The Respondent,	however, contended  that the
original order	of dismissal  dated 14.5.49 was based on the
finding of  guilt recorded in respect of a single charge and
that as	 a second  allegation had  been made  in  the  fresh
inquiry, the provisions of Rule 1706(4) were not attracted.
     Allowing the appeal
^
     HELD:  1.	 Rule  1706   (4)  of	the  Indian  Railway
Establishment Code  is Squarely attracted to the case of the
Respondent. [945 F]
     In the  instant case  the Respondent had been suspended
on 17.2	 49 pending  inquiry and  had not  reported for duty
after the original order of dismissal dated 14.5.49 had been
declared to  be illegal	 by the	 High Court,  in the  second
appeals filed  by both	the parties.  The Respondent must be
deemed to have continued to be under suspension by virtue of
the provisions of Rule 1706 (4) in view of the fresh inquiry
and he	would be  entitled only	 to  subsistence  allowance,
being 50%  of his  wages for  the period of suspension until
the final order of dismissal and not to full wages. [945 G]
     2. The  subsequent inquiry	 was in	 respect of the same
charge namely,	that the  respondent had suppressed the fact
that he	 had been discharged from railway service on 12.4.44
while he  secured employment  in 1948 after the partition of
India. The  fresh charge  dated 22.3.65	 was only  a  single
charge and  the second	allegation, namely,  the declaration
dated 26.1.48 made by the respondent after
939
he joined  the Ex.  B.B. and Central Indian Railway was only
intended to  be A  relied upon for proving that charge. [945

JUDGMENT:
</pre><p id="p_1">     CIVIL APPELLATE  JURISIDICTION: Civil  Appeal No.	1085
of 1981.
</p><p id="p_2">     Appeal by	special leave  from the	 judgment and  order
dated the  28th February,  1979 of  the Rajasthan High Court
(Jaipur Bench)	at Jaipur in S.B. Civil Revn. No. 63 and 158
of 1973.
</p><p id="p_3">     N.C. Taluqdar and R.N. Poddar for the Appellant.
     Respondent in person.
</p><p id="p_4">     The Judgment of the Court was delivered by
     VARADARAJAN, J.  In this  appeal by  special leave	 the
respondent Sunder  Dass appears in person. The appeal by the
Divisional officer,  Western Railway,  Kota is	against	 the
Judgment of Dwarka Prasad, J. Of the Rajasthan High Court at
Jaipur in  Civil Revision  Nos. 63  and	 158  of  1973.	 The
learned Judge allowed Civil Revision No. 63 of 1973 filed by
Sundar Dass  and dismissed  Civil Revision  No. 158  of 1973
filed by  the Divisional  Personnel officer  with  costs  in
both.
</p><p id="p_5">     The two revision petitions were filed against the order
dated 18.9.1972	 passed by  the learned District Judge, Kota
under the  <a href="/doc/794158/" id="a_1">Payment of  Wages Act</a> (hereinafter referred to as
"the Act").  The respondent  filed petitions under<a href="/doc/1106018/" id="a_2"> s. 15</a> (2)
of the	Act before  the Authority under the Act, the Special
Judicial (Railways)  Magistrate, Kota  who held by his order
dated 30-10-1967  that the respondent is entitled to get his
salary for  the period	from 17.2.1949	to  14.5.1949  after
adjustment of  any amount  which might have been paid to him
for that  period. Both	parties filed  appeals against	that
order before  the District  Judge, Kota	 who by	 order dated
18.9.1972 held	that the  respondent should  have been	paid
wages for  the period  of six months prior to 25.3.1963, the
date of	 his application under the Act and also for a period
of six months in respect of each one of his subsequent seven
applications filed under the Act. The learned District Judge
directed the Authority under the Act to calculate the amount
of salary  and dearness	 allowance payable to the respondent
as per	his direction on the basis of the respondent's basic
salary as  on 14.5.1949,  the date of his original dismissal
from service,  after  deducting	 the  usual  Provident	Fund
deduction and other permissible
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">940</span>
deductions, if any. Both parties filed revision petitions in
the High  Court against	 the order  of the  learned District
Judge.
</p><p id="p_6">     The  respondent   was  employed  as  an  Assistant	 Sub
Divisional Clerk  at Sukkar  in the  Karachi Division of the
North Western Railway. While he was working in that capacity
at Nawabshah,  he was discharged from service by order dated
12.4.1944 issued  by the Divisional Engineer. The respondent
instituted a  suit in  the Court  of Judicial  Commissioner,
Karachi for  declaration that  the order  of  discharge	 was
invalid.  During   the	pendency  of  that  suit  there	 was
partition of India and he migrated to India and reported for
duty to the Transfer officer (India) at Ambala Cantonment on
8.1.1948. On  the basis	 of the respondent's declaration, he
was taken  as a	 Clerk in  the former  B.B. &amp;  C.I. Railway,
which eventually  became the  Western Railway.	But when the
fact that  the respondent  had already	been discharged from
railway service	 on 12.4.1944  before the partition of India
took place  came to light, the respondent was suspended from
service on 17.2.1949 and a charge-sheet was issued to him by
the Chief  Engineer of	the Railway  for the  misconduct  of
concealment of	the order  of discharge	 from service and he
was dismissed  from service on 14.5.1949 in pursuance of the
finding of  guilt recorded  in the inquiry. The respondent's
appeal against	the order  of discharge was dismissed by the
General Manager	 of the	 Railway. The  respondent thereafter
filed a	 suit on 10.1.1950 for declaration that the order of
discharge was  void and	 obtained decree in the Trial Court,
which was  modified by	the District  Judge on	appeal. Both
parties filed  Second  Appeals	in  the	 High  Court,  which
dismissed  the	 same  on   6.3.1963  by  holding  that	 the
respondent is  entitled to  a declaration  that the order of
his dismissal from service dated 14.5.1949 is illegal on the
ground that  there was	breach of  the principles of natural
justice and  that it  was,  however,  open  to	the  Railway
Administration	to   take  fresh   disciplinary	 proceedings
against him from the stage at which the illegality crept in.
</p><p id="p_7">     Subsequently,  the	  Chief	 Engineer,  Western  Railway
started	  flesh	  disciplinary	 proceedings   against	 the
respondent and	issued a fresh charge-sheet with a statement
of allegations	against him  on 4.11.1963. No fresh order of
suspension was	issued to  the respondent  on this occasion.
The departmental  inquiry was  held and	 an  inquiry  report
dated 29.11.1965  was made  holding the respondent guilty of
the charge. The Chief Engineer accepted the report of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">941</span>
the Inquiry  officer and  issued a  notice to the respondent
calling upon  him  to  show  cause  against  the  punishment
proposed to  be awarded	 to him and eventually dismissed him
from service  by his order dated 23.12.1966 with effect from
14.5.1949, the date of his original dismissal. This order of
dismissal was  confirmed by  the  General  Manager,  Western
Railways in  the respondent's  appeal which was dismissed on
10.5.1967. The	respondent challenged the order of dismissal
by filing  Writ Petition No, 558 of 1967 which was dismissed
by the	Rajasthan High	Court on 21.11.1971 holding that the
departmental inquiry  was properly  conducted and  that	 the
dismissal is  valid but	 not retrospectively from 14.5.1949.
The  respondent's  Review  Petition  was  dismissed  by	 the
learned Judge of the High Court on 7.3.1972.
</p><p id="p_8">     After the	dismissal of  second appeals on 6.3.1963 the
petitioner moved the Payment of Wages Authority on 25.3.1963
by a petition filed under <a href="/doc/1106018/" id="a_3">section 15</a> (2) of the Act claiming
wages for  the	period	from  17.2.1949,  the  date  of	 the
original   suspension,	 to   28.2.1963	  less	 subsistence
allowance, namely, Rs. 24,792 7() and thereafter filed seven
more petitions	once in	 every six  months claiming  in	 all
wages of  Rs. 34,096.07	 for the  period  from	1.3.1963  to
31.8.1966. As  stated earlier,	the Authority  under the Act
held that the respondent is entitled to wages for the period
from 17.2.1949	to 14.5.1949 and in the appeals filed before
the learned  District Judge  it was held that the respondent
is entitled  to wages  for a  period of	 six months prior to
25.6.1963 and  also for	 the period of six months in respect
of each	 one of	 the seven  petitions filed  by him  and the
District Judge	directed the  Authority	 under	the  Act  to
calculate the  amount payable to the respondent after making
the necessary  deductions on  the basis	 of the respondent's
basic wages as on 14.5.1949. Both the parties filed revision
petitions against the order of the learned District Judge.
</p><p id="p_9">     The plea  of limitation  which  appears  to  have	been
raised in  the revision	 petitions before the learned Single
Judge of  the Rajasthan	 High Court at Jaipur, has been held
to be  no longer  available in view of the decisions of this
Court referred	to in  the Judgment of the High Court in the
Civil Revision	cases under  appeal in	this case. The other
objection raised  under order  2 Rule 2 of the Code of Civil
Procedure in  view of  the fact that the claim for wages had
not been  put forward in the civil suit and connected appeal
and second  appeal has also been rejected by the High Court.
The learned Single Judge held that if the order of dismissal
is set
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">942</span>
aside, it  is not  necessary to	 give a	 further declaration
that the  employee continues to remain in service in view of
the fact  that it  follows as a consequence of that order of
dismissal having been set aside.
</p><p id="p_10">     It was contended before the learned Single Judge of the
High Court  that since after the original order of dismissal
had been  set aside  by the  High  Court,  the	disciplinary
authority had  decided to  hold	 a  fresh  inquiry  and	 had
dismissed the  respondent pursuant  to the  finding of guilt
recorded by  the Inquiry  officer in  the fresh	 inquiry and
accepted by  the disciplinary  authority,  in  view  of	 the
provisions  of	 Rule  1706(4)	 of   the   Indian   Railway
Establishment Code,  the respondent  must be  deemed to have
been placed  under suspension  from the date of the original
order of  dismissal. The  learned Single Judge did not allow
that contention	 to be	raised before him on the ground that
it was	not raised either before the Authority under the Act
or before  the learned	District Judge	in the	appeals. The
learned Judge  dismissed the  Divisional Personnel officer's
revision petition  and	allowed	 the  respondent's  revision
petition with costs and held that the respondent is entitled
to receive arrears of wages from 17-2-1949 to 31-8-1966. The
Divisional Personnel  officer had filed this Civil Appeal by
special leave  against those  orders of	 the learned  Single
Judge of the High Court.
</p><p id="p_11">     The fact  that the	 respondent had	 been dismissed from
service pursuant  to the  finding of  guilt recorded  in the
fresh inquiry  has  not	 been  disputed	 before	 us  by	 the
respondent who	has appeared  in person though the appellant
in this	 appeal	 had  been  directed  by  this	Court  while
ordering show  cause notice in the special leave petition to
deposit a  sum of  Rs. 1,000/-	to enable  the respondent to
engage a  counsel to  appear for  him in this Court and that
amount had  been deposited by the appellant and withdrawn by
the respondent.	 We perused  the record of the fresh inquiry
and are	 satisfied that the respondent has admitted the fact
of his	discharge from	service on  12-4-1944 while securing
fresh employment  under B.B.  &amp; C.I. Rail way. Mr. Taluqdar,
Senior Counsel,	 appearing for	the appellant submitted that
the respondent	had been suspended from service on 17-2-1949
before he was originally dismissed from service on 14-5-1949
pursuant to  a finding of guilt recorded in the departmental
inquiry and  that in  the  subsequent  departmental  inquiry
also,  he   had	 been  found  guilty  and  was	subsequently
dismissed from	service and  therefore,	 by  virtue  of	 the
provisions of Rule 1706(4) of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">943</span>
Indian Railway Establishment Code, he must be deemed to have
A been	under suspension right through from 17-2-1949 and he
would be  entitled only	 to subsistence allowance and not to
full wages for the period from 17-2-1949. Clause (1) of Rule
1706 provides  for a  railway  servant	being  placed  under
suspension  inter   alia  where	 a  disciplinary  proceeding
against him  is contemplated  or pending. Clause (4) of that
rule reads thus:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">	  "Where  a   penalty  of   dismissal,	removal	  or
     compulsory	 retirement  from  service  imposed  upon  a
     railway servant  is set  aside or	declared or rendered
     void in  consequence of  or by a decision of a court of
     law and  the disciplinary authority, on a consideration
     of the  circumstances of  the case,  decides to  hold a
     further inquiry against him on the allegations on which
     the  penalty   of	dismissal,   removal  or  compulsory
     retirement was  originally imposed, the railway servant
     shall be deemed to have been placed under suspension by
     the competent  authority, mentioned  in Rule 1705, from
     the date of the original order of dismissal. removal or
     compulsory retirement  and	 shall	continue  to  remain
     under suspension until further orders".
</blockquote><p id="p_12">We are of the opinion that this sub-clause will be attracted
in cases  where there  had been	 a suspension  of a  railway
servant	 due  to  a  contemplated  or  pending	disciplinary
proceeding and	the  order  of	dismissal  pursuant  to	 the
finding recorded in the disciplinary proceeding is set aside
or declared  or rendered  void in  consequence of  or  by  a
decision of  a court  of law and the disciplinary authority,
on a  consideration of	the circumstances of the case, as in
the present  case, decides  to hold  a fresh inquiry against
him on	the allegations	 on which  the penalty of dismissal,
removal or  compulsory retirement was originally imposed. It
is not	the case  of the respondent that he had resumed duty
after the  original order  of dismissal	 dated 14-S-1949 was
set aside  and that  he continued  to be in service until he
was subsequently  dismissed from  service by the order dated
23.12.1966. It	is seen from the original order of Dismissal
dated 14.5.1949 that the respondent had been informed by the
instruction appended  to that  order that  he would be given
subsistence allowance  at the rate of 50% of his pay for the
period from  17.2.1949 to  14.5.1949, both  days  inclusive,
when he	 remained under	 suspension. The  respondent did not
dispute	 before	 us  the  fact	that  he  was  placed  under
suspension from	 17.2.1949 pending  the inquiry resulting in
his
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">944</span>
dismissal  by  the  order  dated  14.5.1949.  But  what	 the
respondent contended before us is that the original order of
dismissal dated	 14.5.1949 is  based on the finding of guilt
recorded in  respect of	 a single  charge and  that a second
allegation has	been made  in the charge framed in the fresh
inquiry and therefore, the provisions of Rule 1706(4) of the
Indian Railways	 Establishment Code  are not  attracted. The
respondent invited  our attention  to the  fact that  in the
first  suspension   order  dated   17.2.1949,  he  has	been
described as  a Clerk,	Executive  Engineer's  Office,	Kota
Division and  in the  charge framed  in the fresh inquiry on
22-3-1965  as  ex-Clerk	 of  the  office  of  the  Executive
Engineer, Kota	Division and  also to  the fact	 that he had
been informed  by the Chief Engineer's letter dated 9-9-1965
that he	 has not  placed under suspension by the administra-
tion and  only fresh proceedings have been taken against him
in view	 of the	 judgment of  the Rajasthan  High Court	 and
therefore, the	question of  the administration granting him
permission to  leave his  residence or	Kota Railway Station
does not  arise-in support  of his  contention that he could
not be	deemed to  have	 been  under  suspension  after	 his
original order	of dismissal  had been set aside by the High
Court. The  respondent appears to have been conscious of the
fact that  the order  of suspension  dated 17-2-1949 had not
been revoked  when he  applied for permission to absent from
his headquarters.  The Chief Engineer appears to have stated
in his	letter dated  9-9-1965 that  the respondent  had not
been placed  under suspension  and  therefore,	he  did	 not
require the  permission of  the Railway	 ad ministration  to
leave Kota  only on  the basis that there was no fresh order
of suspension  after the  original order  of dismissal dated
14-S-1949 had  been set	 aside by  the High Court. As stated
earlier, the  respondent has  not disputed  the fact that he
had been placed under suspension by the order 17-2-1949, and
it  is	 clear	that  he  was  under  suspension  thereafter
throughout and	he had attained the age of superannuation in
1963, his  year of  birth  being  1908.	 The  charge  framed
against respondent in the first inquiry was this:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">	  "Obtaining  employment   by  concealment   of	 his
     antecedents which	would have  prevented his employment
     in railway	 service, had  they been  known	 before	 his
     appointment, to the authority appointing him."</blockquote>
<p id="p_13">     The reasons for that charge given were that he obtained
employment in the Western Railway by giving false intimation
to the Trans-
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">945</span>
<p id="p_14">fer officer (India), Ambala Cantonment to the effect that he
was in	service on  the North Western Railway at the time of
partition.  In	the  fresh  charge  dated  22.3.1965  framed
against the respondent, it is stated that:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">	  " Fresh proceedings are being taken against him in
     view of  the judgment  of the Rajasthan High Court that
     his dismissal  from service was illegal and he has been
     informed  that   the  charge   is	based	on  (1)	 the
     declaration of  8.1.1948  made  by	 respondent  to	 the
     Assistant Transfer	 officer, Ambala  Cantt. that he was
     working on	 the ex-North  Western Railway	and  was  in
     receipt of	 substantive pay  of Rs.  98/- plus Rs. 4.50
     and has  been confirmed  in that  post on 1.11.1943 and
     (2) the declaration dated 26.1.1948 after he joined the
     Ex-B.B. &amp; C.I. Railway."
</blockquote><p id="p_15">On a  perusal of the two charges, we are of the opinion that
the fresh charge dated 22.3.1965 is only a single charge and
that the  second allegation,  namely, the  declaration dated
26.1.1948 made by the respondent after he joined the Ex-B.B.
&amp; C.I.	Railway, was  only intended  to be  relied upon	 for
proving that charge. We are, therefore, unable to accept the
submission  of	 the  respondent   that	 any   different  or
additional charge  was	framed	against	 him  in  the  fresh
inquiry. The  subsequent inquiry  was in respect of the same
charge, namely,	 that the respondent had suppressed the fact
that  he   had	been  discharged  from	railway	 service  on
12.4.1944 while	 he secured  employment in  1948  after	 the
partition of  India. Rule  1706(4)  of	the  Indian  Railway
Establishment Code  is squarely attracted to the case of the
respondent.  In	  these	 circumstances,	 we  hold  that	 the
respondent who	had  been  suspended  on  17.2.1949  pending
inquiry and  had not  reported for  duty after	the original
order of  dismissal dated  14.5.1949 had been declared to be
illegal by the High Court of Rajasthan in the second appeals
filed by  both the parties, must be deemed to have continued
to be  under suspension	 by virtue of the provisions of Rule
1706(4) in  view of  the fresh inquiry and would be entitled
only to subsistence allowance being 50% of his wages for the
period of  suspension until the final order of dismissal and
not to full wages. The appeal is accordingly allowed, but in
the circumstances  of the  case without costs. The appellant
had deposited  In this	Court a	 sum  of  Rs.  16,000  being
subsistence allowance  for the	said period  as directed  by
this Court
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">946</span>
on 2.12.1980  when notice  to show  cause was ordered in the
special leave  petition and  it has  been withdrawn  by	 the
respondent. We,	 therefore, add that nothing more remains to
be paid to the respondent towards his subsistence allowance.
