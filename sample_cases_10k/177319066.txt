PRAYING TO DIRECT THE 4TH RESPONDENT- COMMITTEE

     THESE WRIT PETITIONS COMING ON FOR

COURT MADE THE FOLLOWING:

                          ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">     The petitioner herein is seeking a writ of madamus in

directing respondent No.4 - Committee represented by

Secretary - Tahsildar to consider her application dated

28.12.1998 which was made by her husband in From No.53

for regularization of his alleged unauthorized cultivation of

land bearing Sy.Nos.313/8, 317/1 and 318/1, measuring to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                 -3-</span>



an extent of 1 acre 03 guntas, 0.26 guntas and 0.22 guntas

respectively of Hunasuru Aspatre Kaval village.


</p><p id="p_2">       2.   When this matter was taken up for consideration

on 4.7.2019, this Court directed the Tahsildar of Hunsur

Taluk to file an affidavit explaining the status of the

application filed by the petitioner's husband.     Accordingly,

this day, Sri.Basvaraja I.E, Tahsildar of Hunsur Taluk, is

present before the Court and he would file his affidavit along

with several documents appended thereto.           In the said

affidavit, the Tahsildar would state that the lands in respect

of which the application is filed by the petitioner's husband

seeking occupancy right, namely lands bearing Sy.No.313/8

measuring 1 acre 03 guntas, Sy.No.317/1 measuring to an

extent of 0.26 guntas and 318/1 measuring to an extent of

0.22   guntas   are   already    granted   in   favour   of   one

Smt.Chinnamma w/o late Krishnappa on 30.10.2014. The

said grant was considered in her name for the reason that,

she was the member and shareholder of Huddur Aspatre

Farmers Kaval Society, which was earlier given certain lands
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                  -4-</span>



in Sy.Nos.313 to 898 on lease basis however, subsequently

the same was cancelled and thereafter, a decision was taken

to allot said lands to the members of the society to cultivate

the same and to regularize their cultivation on the basis of

their    share    holding   in   the   Society     as   its   member.

Accordingly,     the   applications    of   1334    members      were

considered for regularization to an extent of 1750 acres 34

guntas.
</p>
<p id="p_3">
</p><p id="p_4">        3.   In this background, the Tahsildar would state

that the aforesaid lands in respect of which the petitioner's

husband has filed an application seeking regularization, is

already granted in favour of said Chinnamma w/o late

Krishnappa and saguvali chit is already issued to her. He

would further bring to the notice of this Court that, in fact,

the petitioner had challenged the grant with reference to

aforesaid lands in favour of said Chinnamma w/o late

Krishnappa before the Assistant Commissioner, Hunsur, in

Dispute          Nos.SRA.28/2018,           LND.28/2018          and

LND.118/2018, wherein the Assistant Commissioner has
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                 -5-</span>



passed an order on 26.12.2018 in directing the petitioner to

approach the competent authority in challenge to the same

in accordance with law, against which the petitioner is said

to have already filed Rev.Apl.No.97/2019 on the file of the

Karnataka Appellate Tribunal, Bengaluru, which is pending

consideration and that, he has produced all the documents

in the proceedings before the Karnataka Appellate Tribunal.


</p><p id="p_5">     4.    In that view of the matter, this Court is of the

considered opinion that there cannot be two parallel

proceedings with reference to the claim of the petitioner for

the aforesaid extent of lands in question. Therefore, in the

fact situation, question of issuing any kind of writ of

mandamus     or   any   other    order      against    any   of   the

respondents in this proceedings does not arise.                While

observing thus, this Court would direct the petitioner to

pursue the proceedings initiated by her before the KAT in

Rev.Apl.No.97/2019,     which         is   said   to   be    pending

consideration.

</p><p id="p_7">       5. With such observations, these writ petitions are

disposed of. The affidavit filed by the Tahsildar of Hunsur

Taluk is taken on record.
