  W.P. No. 21031 (W) of 2018

In re : M/S. A. Manickam And Sons &amp; Ors.
              - Versus -
        Union of India &amp; Ors.


Mr. Suddhasatva Banerjee,
Mr. Siddhartha Banerjee,
Mr. Pijush Biswas,
Mr. Abhisek Baran Das
                    For the Petitioners
Mr. Rajarshi Halder,
Mr. Subhasis Sen,
Mr. Chirantan Sarkar,
Mr. Mrinal Kanti Mukherjee
                    For the Union of India


         Affidavit of service filed by the petitioners be kept on record. The present writ

petition has been preferred primarily praying for the following relief :

       "(a) A Writ of and/or in the nature of Mandamus be issued commanding the
       respondent authorities and each one of them, their men, agents, staffs,</pre>
<p id="p_1">       subordinates and associates to refrain themselves from giving any effect/further
       effect of the communications issued by the respondent no.2 dated May 10, 2018,
       August 13, 2018 and September 20, 2018 in as much as debarment of your
       petitioners in participating in the retendering process is concerned on any plea
       whatsoever".
</p>
<p id="p_2">
       Drawing the attention of this Court to the impugned order annexed at page 138 of

the writ petition, Mr. Banerjee submits that a penalty has been imposed upon the petitioner

no.1 debarring it from participating in a subsequent tender process on a purported ground it

could not complete the work pertaining to the earlier tender initiated by the notice inviting

tender dated 28th December, 2017 within the time as specified.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                                2</span>

</p><p id="p_3">       He further submits that the delay which occasioned towards completion of the work

was not attributable to the petitioner inasmuch as the required set up of hot mix plant was

not issued by the executive engineer of the concerned department.

</p><p id="p_4">       He further submits that the fresh tender process has been initiated by e-tender

notice dated 28th September, 2018 and the bid submission end date is today i.e. 11th

October, 2018 and the time is up to 3.00 pm.

       Mr. Halder, the learned advocate appearing for the respondents submits that there

is no infirmity in the order impugned by which the petitioner no.1 had been debarred from

participating in the re-tendering process initiated by the e-tender notice dated 28th

September, 2018.
</p>
<p id="p_5">       Upon hearing the learned advocates appearing for the respective parties and upon

considering the materials on record I am prima facie of the opinion that it would be

iniquitous to debar the petitioner from submitting its bid in the tender process initiated by

the e-tender notice dated 28th September, 2018.
</p>
<p id="p_6">       Accordingly, the petitioner no.1 would be at liberty to submit the bid within the time

as specified in the said notice and the respondents shall accept and consider the same. It

is, however, made clear that such participation shall not create any equity in favour of the

petitioner no.1 and the respondents would be at liberty to proceed with the tender process

and to issue work order to the competent and qualified person, who emerges to be

successful in the said tender process.
</p>
<p id="p_7">       List this matter for further consideration after the Vacation.

       Urgent photostat certified copy of this order, if applied for, be given to the learned

advocates for the parties.
