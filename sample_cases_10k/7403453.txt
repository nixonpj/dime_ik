     Bombay. Cheque was encashed on 30.7.2008. Accused no.3 issued the

     the repayment of Rs.25 lac. Said cheque was drawn on Axis Bank

     presented on 20.11.2008 for encashment. However, it was returned

     dishonoured on 24.11.2008 with remarks 'Funds Insufficient'. This




                                     
     intimation was received by the complainant on 4.12.2008. In spite of
                        
     service of the notice, accused persons failed to make the payment within
                       
     the stipulated period. Hence, complaint.
</p>
<p id="p_6">     3           The learned Magistrate issued process under <a href="/doc/1824845/" id="a_2">Section 138</a>

     r/w <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_3">Section 141</a> of the Negotiable Instruments Act against all the three
      


     accused persons.
</p>   



<p id="p_7">     4           Accused no.2 filed a revision application before the





     Sessions Court challenging the issuance of process against her. However,

     that revision application was rejected. Hence, she has filed this writ

     petition to quash the proceedings against her.
</p>




<p id="p_8">     5           The learned counsel for the petitioner raised two grounds in

     support of petition. Firstly, the cheque was allegedly issued by the

     accused no.3 for and on behalf of the accused no.1/company in favour of




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                                 ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 17:05:59 :::</span>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                          3</span>

     the complainant on 30th July, 2008 when there was no legally enforceable

     debt or liability to be discharged by the accused persons because




                                                                        
     according to the complainant herself, she had made payment of Rs.25 lac




                                                
     to the accused no.1 on 1.8.2008 for investment. Thus, the payment was

     allegedly made by the complainant to the accused for investment two




                                               
     days after the disputed cheque was issued by the accused no.3 in favour

     of the complainant. Second ground is that the accused no.2, i.e., the




                                      
     present petitioner had resigned from the post of director of the accused
                      
     no.1 company with effect from 5.9.2008 and for that purpose form no.32
                     
     was filled and submitted to the Registrar of Companies and thus, with

     effect from 5.9.2008, she is not a director. The cause of action, if any,

     arose when the cheque was dishonoured and in spite of service of
      


     notice , payment was not made within the stipulated period. Notice was
   



     issued on 20.12.2008 and it was allegedly served on 24.12.2008. When





     the payment was not made within 15 days from that date, then only the

     offence under <a href="/doc/1824845/" id="a_4">Section 138</a> committed. Infact since long before that date

     the petitioner was not director and, therefore, she could not be held





     guilty for the offences punishable under <a href="/doc/1824845/" id="a_5">Sections 138</a> r/w <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_6">section 141</a> of

     the Negotiable Instruments Act.
</p>
<p id="p_9">     6           The learned counsel for the respondent/complainant




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                                ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 17:05:59 :::</span>

     contended that certified copy of the form 32 was not produced before the

     trial court but he admits that copy of form 32 was produced in the




                                                                        
     Sessions Court in the year 2009. According to him, genuineness of the




                                                
     same was disputed by the complainant. However, the learned counsel

     candidly admit that since then complainant had never made any attempt




                                               
     to approach the office of the Registrar of Companies to verify whether

     information given in Form 32 about resignation of the accused no.2 from




                                    
     the post of director of the accused no.1 with effect from 5.9.2008 was
                      
     genuine or not. It shows that complainant never bothered to verify the
                     
     correctness of this information. Petitioner has produced certified true

     copy of Form 32 before this Court. The learned counsel for the

     complainant contended that mere production of certified copy of the
      


     Form 32 is not sufficient. Truthfulness of the contents is required to be
   



     proved as held by Division Bench of this Court in Suhas Bhand v/s.
</p>




<p id="p_10">     State of Maharashtra and Another 2009 ALL MR Criminal 2614. In

     view of the said authority, either complainant may be given time to

     verify from the office of the Registrar of Companies as to whether





     information given by the accused no.2 about the resignation in Form 32

     is genuine or not or this matter may be remanded back to the concerned

     Magistrate to call upon the parties to lead evidence in respect of the

     limited issue as to whether accused no.2 had ceased to be a director of

     the accused no.1 Company with effect from 5.9.2008 or not. However, in




                                                                           
     the present case, in view of the facts disclosed by the complainant itself,




                                                   
     I find that it is not necessary to go for any of these two options.
</p>
<p id="p_11">     7            Complaint itself shows that the cheque, on the basis of




                                                  
     which the complaint was filed, was issued on 30.7.2008. According to

     her, it was towards the repayment of Rs.25 lac but paragraph 3 of the




                                      
     complaint shows that complainant had allegedly made payment of Rs.25
                         
     lac to the accused no.1 by cheque dated 1.8.2008 for investment. From
                        
     this it is clear that complainant made payment to the accused no.
</p>
<p id="p_12">     1/company for the first time on 1.8.2008 and till that date, there was no

     debt or liability to be discharged by any of the accused persons. In
      


     paragraph 5 of the complaint also the complainant contended that cheque
   



     was issued by the accused no.3 for and on behalf of the accused no.1 in





     favour of the complainant on 30.7.2008 towards repayment of the

     liability. On 30.7.2008 there was no debt or liability to be discharged by

     the accused persons and, therefore, question of issuing cheque in





     discharge of debt or liability legally enforceable under the law would not

     arise. Therefore,   when this cheque was issued, it was without any

     consideration and it was certainly not for discharge of any liability or




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                                   ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 17:05:59 :::</span>

     debt enforceable under law. It appears that the learned Magistrate while

     issuing process had not noted this important aspect revealed from




                                                                         
     paragraphs 3 and 5 of the complaint. Not only this, the learned Sessions




                                                 
     Court, while rejecting the revision application, also ignored these

     important facts. Had these facts been taken note of, process could not




                                                
     have been issued against the accused persons. This petition is filed only

     by the accused no.2 to quash the issuance of process against her.

     considered opinion, in the interest of justice, process issued against all
