<div class="doc_title">Hajrat Ansari And Anr vs The State Of Jharkhand And Anr on 18 November, 2016</div><pre id="pre_1">      IN THE HIGH COURT OF JHARKHAND AT RANCHI
                Cr.M.P. No. 600 of 2016
           1. Hajrat Ansari
           2. Sabiran Khatoon              .... Petitioners
                         Versus

</p><p id="p_3">      For the Petitioners : Mr. Rajnikant Ojha, Advocate

      For the O.P. No. 2  : Mr. Naresh Prasad Thakur, Advocate

</p><p id="p_5">      Order No. 07                           Dated 18th November, 2016

            Heard Mr. Rajnikant Ojha, learned counsel appearing for the
petitioners and learned APP appearing for the State as also Mr. Mr. Naresh
Prasad Thakur, learned counsel for the opposite party No. 2.
</p><p id="p_6">            In this application, the petitioners have prayed for quashing the
First Information Report including the entire criminal proceedings in
connection with Itki P.S. Case No. 27 of 2015 corresponding to G.R. No. 1683
of 2015, pending before learned Judicial Magistrate, Ranchi.
</p><p id="p_7">            An F.I.R. was instituted by the opposite party No. 2 in which
allegation was levelled that the son of the petitioners had established physical
relationship with the opposite party No. 2 on the inducement of marrying her.
It is alleged that the marriage of the opposite party No. 2 was fixed with
another person, but on account of threat meted out by the accused persons,
the said marriage was cancelled. It is further alleged that on 07.03.2015, she
was called by her paramour to village Gurgaon for solemnization of marriage
and thereafter she had gone to Simaria, but ultimately on account of pressure
given by the family members, the said marriage could not be solemnized,
which ultimately led to institution of Itki P.S. Case No. 27 of 2015.
</p><p id="p_8">      It has been submitted by the learned counsel for the petitioners that the
petitioners are the parents of Md. Shakil Ansari who is said to have
established physical relationship with the opposite party No. 2 on the pretext
of marriage. Learned counsel submits that Md. Shakil Ansari has faced trial in
S.T. No. 513 of 2015 and taking into consideration that the marriage between
Shakil Ansari and the opposite party No. 2 had already been solemnized and
they were living together, he was acquitted by the learned trial court. It has
further been submitted that the parents were never in picture and since the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                      2.</span>
son of the petitioners and the opposite party No. 2 are staying together, the
entire criminal proceeding deserves to be quashed and set aside.
</p><p id="p_9">            Learned counsel appearing for the opposite party No. 2 has
supported the argument advanced by the learned counsel for the petitioner
and has stated that Shakil Ansari has already solemnized marriage with
opposite party No. 2 in such circumstance he is not opposing the prayer of
quashing the entire criminal proceeding.
</p><p id="p_10">            The trial court judgment dated 22.01.2016 reveals that Shakil
Ansari and the opposite party No. 2 pursuant to love affair had established
physical relationship and subsequent to the alleged institution of the F.I.R.,
she has already solemnized marriage with Shakil Ansari. The opposite party
No. 2 who had been examined as P.W. 1 in trial did not support the
prosecution case in view of the subsequent development and she was
declared hostile by the prosecution. The petitioners are the parents of Shakil
Ansari and even as per the F.I.R., the entire allegation was levelled against
Shakil Ansari for establishing physical relationship on the promise of
marriage. Since marriage of Shakil Ansari and the opposite party No. 2 has
already been solemnized and they are living together, the complicity of the
petitioners being the parents of Shakil Ansari gets negated.
</p><p id="p_11">      In view of what has been stated above, this application is allowed and
the entire criminal proceedings in connection with Itki P.S. Case No. 27 of
2015 corresponding to G.R. No. 1683 of 2015, pending before learned
Judicial Magistrate, Ranchi is hereby quashed and set aside.
