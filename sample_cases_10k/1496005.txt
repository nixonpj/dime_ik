ACT:
Criminal    Law--Practice    and    Procedure--Offence	  of
murder--Circumstances justifying lesser sentence.



HEADNOTE:
The  appellant,	 a rustic young woman, flogged	out  of	 her
husband's  house by her father-in-law, was living  with	 her
parents with her only child.  She committed a  premeditated,
cleverly planned murder of another young woman and her child
because	 of rivalry between the appellant and  the  murdered
woman for the affections of an illicit lover.  The  Sessions
court  awarded	the  death  sentence  and  the	High   Court
confirmed.
In appeal to this Court.
HELD  :	 The  death  sentence must  be	dissolved  and	life
sentence substituted.
(i)  Modern  penology regards crime and criminal as  equally
material  when	the  right sentence has	 to  be	 picked	 out
although   in  our  processual	system	there	is   neither
comprehensive	provision   nor	  adequate   machinery	 for
collection  and presentation of social and personal data  of
the  culprit  to  the  extent required	in  the	 verdict  on
sentence.   However, in the Criminal Procedure	Bill,  1973,
Parliament has wisely written into the law a post conviction
stage  when  the  judges  shall "hear  the  accused  on	 the
question  of  sentence	and  then  pass	 sentenced  on	 him
according to law." [334 C]
The unmistakable shift in legislative emphasis is that	life
imprisonment for murder is the rule and capital sentence the
exception  to be resorted to for reasons to be stated.	 The
disturbed  conscience of the state on the vexed question  of
legal threat to life by way of death sentence has sought  to
express	 itself legislatively, the stream of tendency  being
towards	 cautious  partial abolition and  the  retreat	from
total retention. [336 H]
Code of Criminal Procedure Section 367(5) as amended by	 Act
26 of 1955; Criminal Procedure Bill, 1973, Sections 235, 238
and  354(3);<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_1">	 Indian Penal Code</a> (Amendment)	Bill,  1972,
<a href="/doc/1661760/" id="a_2">Section 122</a>, referred to.
     (ii)  The case on hand has to be disposed of under	 the
present Code and the Court has to fall back upon the  method
of  judicial bunch in imposing or avoiding capital  sentence
aided  by  such circumstances as are present on	 the  record
introduced for the purpose of proving guilt. [334 D]
     (iii)  In	the present case the criminal's	 social	 and
personal factors, her feminity and youth, her unbalanced sex
and expulsion from the conjugal home and being the mother of
a young boy-these individually inconclusive and cumulatively
marginal  facts and circumstances tend towards	awarding  of
life imprisonment. [339 B--C]
     Further,  the  Sessions  Judge  pronounced	 the   death
penalty on December, 31, 1971 and the appeal is being  heard
in  February  1974. This prolonged  agony  has	ameliorative
impact according to the rulings of this Court.

JUDGMENT:
</pre><p id="p_1">CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION : Criminal Appeal No. 67  of
1973.
</p><p id="p_2">     Appeal  by	 Special Leave from the Judgment  and  Order
dated the 24th March, 1972 of the Andhra Pradesh High  Court
in  Criminal Appeal No. 12 of 1972 and Referred Trial No.  1
of 1972.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">330</span>
<p id="p_3">R.   P. Kathuria, amicus curiae for the appellant.
P.   Ram Reddy and P. P. Rao for the respondent.
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by
KRISHNA	 IYER,	J.  In	a rural	 region	 of  Andhra  Pradesh
Freudian fury or explosion of sex jealousy expressed  itself
in  a gruesome murder of a young woman and her tender  child
by the accused, :a young woman, with an only child ten years
old,  all, because notwithstanding both being married,	they
had invested amorous affections in a middle-aged  libertine.
P.W.  16,  conveniently a widower.  It is an  admitted	fact
that  the  accused, although married,  was  keeping  illicit
relations with P.W. 16, a shepherd, but she discovered	that
lately	her  paramour  was on  flirting	 contacts  with	 the
deceased.   This  knowledge  angered her so  much  that	 she
extinguished  the life of her rival on November 4,  1971  in
the  afternoon	in  a  jungle,	manipulating  her  murderous
venture so cleverly that for a time people thought that	 she
was the murdered and searched for her body.  Closer  enquiry
revealed  that the victim was Ansuya and the other  innocent
one her baby less than two years old.
</p><p id="p_4">Shri  Kathuria, appearing as amicus curiae, has presented  a
painstakingly meticulous argument on behalf of the prisoner,
who has been condemned to death by the courts below.  It  is
but  meet  that	 we  appreciate	 the  industrious   advocacy
enthusiastically made by this young advocate.
By  sundown  on November 4, 1971 a cadaver was	found  in  a
field outside the village of Konapur, Medak District, Andhra
Pradesh.   The deceased was a damsel who was first  mistaken
to  be	the accused because her face had been burnt  out  of
recognition  and  on  her  body	 was  found  clothing  which
belonged  to  the accused a deviced to,	 as  later  evidence
discloses, by the accused to throw enquirers off ,the scent.
On  November  8,  1971 the dead body  of  a  baby,  Nirmala.
daughter  of Ansuya, the deceased, was recovered,  from	 the
sand  bed  ,of	a stream  near	the  field.   Investigations
disclosed  that Anamma. the accused, was the perpetrator  of
this fiendish crime.  She was duly prosecuted, convicted and
sentenced  to  death  for the offence  of  murder  and	life
imprisonment for secreting evidence of the crime, 'under <a href="/doc/1666329/" id="a_6"> s.
20</a> <a href="/doc/1873250/" id="a_7">1</a>, <a href="/doc/1873250/" id="a_8">1</a>. P. C. An appeal by the accused and a referred trial
under<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_9">  the  Code</a>  resulted  in a Bench	of  the	 High  Court
affirming  the	guilt and upholding the	 sentence.   A	jail
appeal has come before us, argued by Shri Kathuria as amicus
curiae.
</p><p id="p_5">The  people involved are more or less primitive rustics	 and
sex  inhibitions do not appear to have	interdicted  private
philandering.	The prisoner had been married to P.W.  7  of
Ankenpally,  three  miles  distant from	 Konapur  where	 her
parents	 resided.  Carnal knowledge with P.W.  16  developed
even when she was in her husband's house and she  manifested
her  passion  by stealing gold rings from the house  of	 one
Rachappa  to  make it over to P.W. 16 as a  memento  of	 her
illicit	 love, Indeed, this little stealing, induced by	 her
improper
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">331</span>
relations  with	 P.  W. 16, was	 discovered.   She  suffered
flagellation  from her father-in-law for this act,  and	 her
father,	 P.W. 2, removed her to his own house as  a  sequel.
The  setting  of  Konapur did not stand in the	way  of	 her
continued  intimacy with P.W. 16, who responded by  shifting
to this village himself.
</p><p id="p_6"> The  deceased, Ansuya, was the wife of P.W. 12 who was,  as
ill-luck  would	 have  it, the neighbour  of  the  accused's
family.	  Opportunity  tempted and Ansuya  also	 established
erotic contact with that lascivious, P.W. 16.  The prisoner,
in due course, came to know about the shifting of affections
by  her paramour who tried to bluff her in vain.   Fired  by
jealously  the prisoner fixed her mind upon liquidating	 her
rival.
</p><p id="p_7">On  November 4, 1971 at about 3 p.m. the ill-starred  Ansuya
had  left  for	the fields taking the baby  with  her.	 The
accused tempted and shadowed her, with some clothes from her
house, to be washed in the  village stream.  P. W. 15, P. W.
4 and P. W. 13 have given testimony which, if believed, will
show that the accused and the deceased were seen together in
the  fatal  field at about 5 p.m., the day  the	 mother	 and
child  died.   It  is said that the accused  had  removed  a
chisel from her house as she proceeded to the field and used
it  to	lethal	purpose.  The medical  evidence	 shows	that
Ansuya	and  Nirmala  were stabbed to death  with  a  chisel
identified  by	the accused's own father, P.W.	2,  and	 the
blacksmith who made it, P.W. 15.  Apparently overborne	with
uncontrollable	hatred	for  the  woman	 who  hijacked	 her
paramour's sexual affection, the accused had planned to kill
with  cunning.	 The  manner of stabbing to  death  was	 bad
enough;	 it was more brutal for her to have  disfigured	 the
face  of the victim which was found burnt.  With a  view  to
mislead	 and thereby evade easy detection she  removed	from
the  deceased's	 body  her clothes and	clothed	 it  with  a
language  belonging  to herself.  She  removed	the  child's
body,  wrapped	it in a piece of cloth brought	by  her	 and
buried	it  beneath  the river sand.   Thereafter  she	made
towards the house of P. W. 11, her uncle, told P. W. 16 what
she  had done and pressed him to elope with her.  The  sense
of  safety  of	P.W.  16 prevailed over	 his  urge  for	 sex
relations  with this girl and so he declined to follow	her.
The disparate woman left for her husband's village, while  a
search	for her was being made by P. W. 2, her father.	 The
dead body in the field was found covered with the  accused's
clothing  and beguiled by this circumstance P.W. 2  reported
to  the police Patel, P.W., 5 (Ex.  P 1) that  his  daughter
had  been murdered, perhaps by her father-in-law.  Taken  in
by  this report, the Patel informed the police and the	Sub-
Inspector,  P.W. 26, proceeded to the scene  of	 occurrence,
held  inquest and sent the body for postmortem	examination.
P.W.  22,  the doctor, did the autopsy in the  afternoon  of
November 5. 1971 and the body was brought back to Konapur by
sundown.   The	Inspector of Police took over  the  investi-
gation,	 took into custody the clothes" near the  scene	 and
questioned  a number of persons in the village.	 The  tragic
body  was being made ready for cremation when the  Patel  of
village Ankanpally, P.W. 10,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">332</span>
moved	down  to  the  place  with  the	 accused,   to	 the
bewilderment  of the people gathered.  Meanwhile,  P.W.	 12,
the  husband of Ansuya, finding his wife and child  missing,
went  in search of them vain. The tidings came of  the	dead
body and the revelation that it was not that of the accused,
as originally suspected.  So apprehension turned on the dead
body  being that of Ansuya.  They went to the place  but  it
was  night and the next morning, i.e., November 6, 1971,  P.
W. 12the husband-and P.W. 13-the mother-in-law-examined	 the
corpse	and to their shock discovered it to be the  body  of
Ansuya.	 A Panchnama, P-10, was prepared.  P.W. 12  reported
to the police officer, P.W. 27 (Ex.  P-2) and investigations
revived	 in  the  new  direction.  P. W.  27  sent  for	 the
accused, who wanted to see her son, and they all met at	 the
police	station.  P.W. 16 turned up at the  police  station,
and  breaking down perhaps under the stress of all that	 had
happened, the accused said that she would confess.  Ex.	  P-
7,  the confession, was recorded which led to the  discovery
of the child's body, the bundle containing the burnt clothes
and chisel, etc. (Ex.  P-8).  The langha of the accused	 was
also  recovered (Ex.  P-9).  Post-mortem was done  over	 the
body  of the child, the accused was arrested and  eventually
she  was charged with offences under<a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_10"> S. 302</a> and<a href="/doc/1666329/" id="a_11"> s. 20</a> <a href="/doc/1873250/" id="a_12">1</a>,  I.
P. C
of  course, there is no direct evidence in the case but	 the
prosecution  has placed a clinching wealth of  circumstances
and an extra-judicial confession to P.W. 16 to	substantiate
its version.  It is trite law that Ex.	P-7, the  confession
made while in police custody, is inadmissible except to	 the
narrow extent salvaged by discoveries made in terms of<a href="/doc/1312051/" id="a_13"> S. 27</a>
of  the	 Evidence  Act.	 We are left,  therefore,  with	 the
confessional statement made to P.W. 16 orally.	If it can be
invested with veracity the guilt of the accused is virtually
made out.  But it is common-place law-and vehemently  urged-
that  a retracted confession made orally to  a	near-villain
like P.W. 16, who had reason to play for safety, was  liable
to be rejected without a second look at the statement.	 The
High  Court-and the Sessions Court-have considered the	many
weaknesses relating to this confession.	 Those defects	have
been pointed as deadly by counsel for the appellant.  We are
satisfied that the credence given to it by the courts  below
cannot	 be  treated  as  strange  or  otherwise   seriously
erroneous.  Certainly he had no ill-feeling for the  accused
and  nothing  palpably improbable has been made out  in	 the
spontaneous  unburdening  of  her bosom by  the	 accused  in
distress, hastening to her paramour after the murder in	 the
hope  that she would now vanish with her lover, and  telling
him  the  murderous truth.  Marginal mistrust  generated  by
counsel's argument is inadequate to reject the testimony  of
P.W. 16.  However, there are circumstances attaching to	 his
whereabouts  and  the slight delay in his statement  to	 the
police and the dubiety of his character which permitted	 his
openly	wearing	 a stolen gold ring  received  from  another
man's  wife.   It is but fair, therefore, for the  Court  to
search	for convincing corroboration. The  precedents  cited
before	us by counsel for the appellant take us	 no  further
than  the  need to ask for satisfactory reinforcement  of  a
retracted   confession	not  too  good	to  be	treated	  as
sufficient in itself to fasten the guilt.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">333</span>
<p id="p_8">We  are,  therefore, thrown to the task	 of  evaluating	 the
circumstances  and the extent to which they buttress up	 the
self-incrimination content in the confession-
Motive by itself is not much, particularly in the absence of
direct	evidence,  but in the company of  other	 factors  it
plays  a probative role.  The discovery of the child's	dead
body  and the clothes belonging to the accused, as  well  as
the  chisel  of P. W. 2, the father,  which  was  admittedly
missing,  are  a  clear pointer to the	guilt,	although  by
themselves do not cover the entire distance from "may be" to
"must  be"  in the proof of guilt.  The noose  of  guilt  is
tightened by the testimony of P.Ws. 4, 13 and 15.  P.W.	 13,
the mother-in-law of Ansuya, deposed that the deceased,	 her
daughter-in-law,  went	out  to fetch  vegetables  from	 the
fields and the accused was seen following her with a  bundle
of  clothes  to	 wash  them in the stream.   P.	 W.  15,  an
apparently  disinterested  man, speaks of  having  seen	 the
accused	 at Khallam at about 5 p.m. near where the  deceased
also  was.   Although  the trial court	did  not  choose  to
believe	 him,  the appellate court thought that it  was	 not
risky  to  rely on his testimony.  P. W. 4  also  swore.  to
having	seen the accused at Khallam at about sundown on	 the
relevant  date.	 This shepherd also states that he  saw	 the
deceased collecting firewood near about there and heard	 the
cries  of a girl.  There has been a detailed  discussion  of
the  evidence  of  these witnesses by  the  High  Court	 and
notwithstanding	  the  attempt	elaborately  made  by	Shri
Kathuria,  the	evidence  of these witnesses  has  not	been
fractured or rendered incredible.
</p><p id="p_9">The fact that the accused was seen last with the deceased in
a place where and at a time when few others were around, the
fact  that the deceased's body was covered cleverly  by	 the
clothes	 of  the accused-foolishly, as we now see  by  hind-
sight-the discovery of telltale clothes on the baby's  body,
the lethal chisel, her blood-stained skirt concealed in	 the
bush, all strongly probabilise the truth of the	 confession.
In a well-considered judgment the learned Judges of the High
Court have covered all the relevant evidence and reached the
unhesitating  conclusion that the accused had done to  death
Ansuya	and Nirmala.  Shri Kathuria's persistent  effort  to
attack	almost	every  part  of	 the  prosecution   evidence
testifies  to his industry, which we appreciate, but  hardly
carries conviction.  All the circumstances converge  towards
the  focal  point  of  guilt of	 the  accused,	her  fatuous
assumption that others would be deceived along a wrong trail
has  failed,  and the impending cremation which	 would	have
blotted out a vital evidence was averted and truth has	come
out.  We have hardly 'any doubt that the conviction deserves
to be confirmed.
</p><p id="p_10">Counsel	 for the State correctly drew our attention to	'the
great  limitations  on	the exercise  of  the  extraordinary
jurisdiction   under   <a href="/doc/427855/" id="a_14">art.   136</a>   of	 the   Constitution,
particularly,  when dealing with the concurrent findings  of
fact.	He  is right in contending that we,  should  dismiss
arguments which nibble at the credibility of witnesses.	 But
finding	 the  case  hanging on	a  retracted  extra-judicial
confession from
9--L954 Sup CI/74
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">334</span>
a person who does not necessarily inspire great	 confidence,
corroborated only by circumstantial evidence, we thought  it
proper	to make a conscientious search to see, if truth	 had
been  reached  and miscarriage of justice averted.   We	 are
satisfied,  as already stated, that the accused's guilt,  to
the  extent human instruments can apprehend, has  been	made
out.
</p><p id="p_11">Guilt  once established, the punitive dilemma  begins.	 The
choice between death penalty and life term has to be made in
a  situation which is not altogether  satisfactory.   Modern
penology regards crime and criminal as equally material when
the  right  sentence has to be picked out, although  in	 our
processual  system there is neither comprehensive  provision
nor  adequate machinery for collection and  presentation  of
the  social and personal data of the culprit to	 the  extent
required  in  the  verdict on  sentence.   However,  in<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_15">	 the
Criminal  Procedure  Code</a>, 1973, about to come	into  force,
Parliament has wisely written into the law a post-conviction
stage  when  the  Judges  shall "hear  the  accused  on	 the
question of sentence and then pass sentence on him according
to law." (S. 235 &amp;<a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_16"> s. 248</a>).
</p><p id="p_12">The  case  on hand has to be disposed of under	the  present
Code  and we have to fall back upon the method	of  judicial
hunch  in  imposing or avoiding capital sentence,  aided  by
such  circumstances as are present on the record  introduced
for  the  purpose of proving guilt.  We are  aware  that  in
<a href="/doc/1837051/" id="a_17">Jagmohan  Singh v. State of U. P</a>.(1), there was an  argument
about  the  absence of procedure laid down by  the  law	 for
determining whether the sentence- of death or something less
is appropriate in the case.  The Court viewed this Criticism
from the constitutional angle and observed :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">	      "The Court is primarily concerned with all the
	      facts and circumstances in so far as they	 are
	      relevant to the crime and how it was committed
	      and since at the end of the trial he is liable
	      to   be	sentenced,   all   the	 facts	 and
	      circumstances  bearing  upon  the	 crime	 are
	      legitimately  brought  to the  notice  of	 the
	      court. Apart from the cross-examination	  of
	      the  witnesses.  the<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_18"> Criminal  Procedure	Code</a>
	      requires	that the accused must be  questioned
	      with  regard  to the  circumstances  appearing
	      against  him  in	the evidence.	He  is	also
	      questioned generally on the case and there  is
	      an  opportunity  for him to  say	whatever  he
	      wants to say.  He has a right to examine	him-
	      self  as	a  witness,  thereafter,  and	give
	      evidence on the material facts.  Again he	 and
	      his  counsel  are at liberty  to	address	 the
	      court not merely on the question of guilt	 but
	      also   on	 the  question	of   sentence.	  In
	      important	 cases like murder the court  always
	      gives  a chance to the accused to address	 the
	      court on the question of sentence."
	      "The  sentence follows the conviction, and  it
	      is true that no formal procedure for producing
	      evidence with reference
	      (1) [1973] 1 S. C. C. 20.
</blockquote><span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">	      335</span>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">	      to the sentence is specifically provided.	 The
	      reason	is   that   relevant	facts	 and
	      circumstances  impinging	on the	'nature	 and
	      circumstances of the crime are already  before
	      the court."
</blockquote><p id="p_13">In  any	 scientific  system which turns the  focus,  at	 the
sentencing  stage,  not	 only  on the  crime  but  also	 the
criminal,  and seeks to personalise the punishment  so	that
the  reformatory  component  is as ,much  operative  as	 the
deterrent  element, it is essential that facts of  a  social
and personal nature, sometimes altogether irrelevant if	 not
injurious  at the stage of fixing the guilt, may have to  be
brought to the notice of the Court when the actual  sentence
is determined.
</p><p id="p_14">The  prisoner  is  a young woman of 24 flogged	out  of	 her
husband's  house  by  the father-in-law,  living-  with	 her
parents	 with her only child  sex-starved and  single.	 The
ethos of the rural area where the episode occurred does	 not
appear	to have been too strict or inhibitive in matters  of
sex, for the deceased and the accused were both married	 and
still philandered out of wedlock with P.W. 16, a middle-aged
widower	 who  made  no bones  about  playing  the  freelance
romancer  simultaneously with them.  Therefore, the  accused
incautiously  slipped down into the sex net spread  by	P.W.
16,  and while entangled and infatuated, discovered  in	 the
deceased  a nascent rival.  With the reckless passion  of  a
jealous mistress she planned to liquidate her competitor and
crudely performed the double murder, most foul.	 Perhaps  it
may be a fable extenuation to remember that the accused is a
young woman who attended routinely to the chores of domestic
drudgery and allowed her flesh to assert itself	 salaciously
when  invited by uncensured opportunity for lonely  meetings
with  P.W. 16.	It may also be worth mentioning that,  apart
from  her youth and womanhood, she has a young boy  to	look
after.	 What  may  perhaps  be	 an  extrinsic	factor	 but
recognised  by	the court as of humane significance  in	 the
sentencing context is the brooding horror of 'hanging' which
has  been  haunting the prisoner in her condemned  cell	 for
over  two  years.  The Sessions Judge pronounced  the  death
penalty	 on  December 31, 1971, and we are now	in  February
1974.	 This  prolonged  agony	 has   ameliorative   impact
according to the rulings of this Court.	 The leading case in
<a href="/doc/1481954/" id="a_19">Piara Dusadh v. Emperor</a>(1) was relied upon by this Court  in
<a href="/doc/637593/" id="a_20">N. Sreeramula v. State of Andhra Pradesh</a>(2).  The  following
passage from the Federal Court decision is telling :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">	      "In committing the offence the appellant	must
	      have   been   actuated  by  jealousy   or	  by
	      indignation either of which would tend further
	      to  disturb the balance of his mind.   He	 has
	      besides  been awaiting the execution  of	this
	      death sentence for over a year.  We think that
	      in this case a sentence of transportation	 for
	      life  would  be  more  appropriate  than	 the
	      sentence of death."

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">336</span>
<p id="p_16"> The  decision	in  <a href="/doc/95498/" id="a_21">State of  Bihar  v.	 Pashupati  Singh</a>(1)
strikes	 a  similar note.  Although  this  consideration  is
vulnerable  to the criticism made by counsel for  the  State
that  as  between two capital sentence cases that  which  is
delayed in its ultimate disposal by the courts receives	 the
less  terrible punishment while the other heard	 with  quick
despatch, for that very reason, fails to relieve the  victim
from condemnation to death.
</p><p id="p_17">In  this unclear situation it is unfortunate that there	 are
no penological guidelines in the statute for preferring	 the
lesser	 sentence,  it	being  left  to	 ad   hoc   forensic
impressionism  to  decide for life or for death.   Even	 so,
such  sentencing  material as we have been able	 to  salvage
from  the guilt material in the paper book persuades  us  to
award  life imprisonment to the prisoner and modify to	that
extent the death sentence imposed by the courts below.
It  behaves us to indicate why we have chosen  this  course.
In the twilight of law in this area, we have been influenced
by  the seminal trends present in the  current	sociological
thinking  and penal strategy in regard to murder.   We	have
also  given  thought to the legal changes wrought  into	 the
penal code in free India.  We confess to the impact made  on
us  by	legislative and judicial approaches  made  in  other
countries   although  we  have	warned	 ourselves   against
transplanting  into  our country  concepts  and	 experiences
valid in the West.
</p><p id="p_18">It cannot be emphasised too often that crime and  punishment
are functionally related to the society in which they occur,
and  Indian conditions and stages of progress must  dominate
the exercise of judicial discretion in this case.
In  India the subject of capital punishment  has  abortively
come   before  Parliament  earlier,  although	our   social
scientists  have  not made any sociological  or	 statistical
study in depth yet.  On the statutory side there has been  a
significant change since India became free.  Under  s.367(5)<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_22">
of  the	 Criminal  Procedure Code</a>, as it  stood	 before	 its
amendment by Act 26 of 1955, the normal rule was to sentence
to  death  a person convicted for murder and to	 impose	 the
lesser	sentence for reasons to be recorded in writing.	  By
amendment,  this provision was deleted with the result	that
the court is now free to award either death sentence or life
imprisonment,  unlike formerly when death was the  rule	 and
life  term the exception, for recorded reasons.	 In the	 new<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_23">
Criminal  Procedure Code</a>, 1973 a great change has  overtaken
the law.  <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_24">Section 354(3)</a> reads :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_4">	      "354(3) When the conviction is for an  offence
	      punishable with death or, in the	alternative,
	      with imprisonment for life or imprisonment for
	      a term of years, the judgment shall state	 the
	      reasons for the sentence awarded, and, in	 the
	      case of sentence of death, the special reasons
			    for such sentence."
</blockquote><p id="p_19">The unmistakable shift in legislative emphasis is that	life
imprisonment for murder is the rule and capital sentence the
exception to be
(1)  A. 1. R. 1973 S. C. 2699.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">337</span>
<p id="p_20">resorted  to for reasons to be stated.	In this	 context  it
may  not  be  out  of  place  to  indicate-not	that  it  is
conclusive  since it is now tentative that under<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_25"> the  Indian
Penal Code</a> (Amendment) Bill, 1972,<a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_26"> s. 302</a> of the Penal	Code
has  been  substituted by a less  harsh	 provision  limiting
death penalty to a few special cases (vide<a href="/doc/989396/" id="a_27"> s. 122</a> of the new
bill).
</p><p id="p_21">It is obvious that the disturbed conscience of the State  on
the  vexed question of legal threat to life by way of  death
sentence  has  sought to express itself	 legislatively,	 the
stream of tendency being towards cautious, partial abolition
and a retreat from total retention.
</p><p id="p_22">Jagmohan    Singh(1)   has   adjudged	 capital    sentence
constitutional	 and  whatever	our  view  of	the   social
invalidity of the death penalty, personal predilections must
bow to the law as by this Court declared, adopting the noble
words  of  Justice Stanley Mosk of California uttered  in  a
death sentence case : "As a judge, I am bound to the law  as
I find it to be and not as I fervently wish it to be".	(The
Yale  Law Journal, Vol. 82, No. 6, P.1138). Even so, when  a
wise discretion vests in the court, what are the  guidelines
in  this  life	and  death choice  ?  The  humanism  of	 our
Constitution,	echoing	  the  concern	of   the   Universal
Declaration  of Human Rights, is deeply concerned about	 the
worth  of  the human person.   Ignoring	 the  constitutional
content of Anderson (2), and Furman(3), the humanist  thrust
of  the	 Judicial vote against cruel or	 unusual  punishment
cannot	be  lost on the Indian	judiciary.   The  deterrence
strategists argue that social defence is served only by	 its
retention,-thanks  to the strong association between  murder
and capital punishment in the public imagination,-while	 the
correctional  therapists urge the reform of  even  murderers
and not to extinguish them by execution.  History  hopefully
reflects  the  march  of  civilization	from  terrorism	  to
humanism and the geography of death penalty depicts  retreat
from  country  after country.  The U.K. and the	 U.S.A.	 are
notable instances.  Among the socialist nations it has	been
restricted  to	very aggravated forms of  murder.   The	 lex
talionis principle of life for life survives in some  States
still,	only to highlight that in punitive practice,  as  in
other  matters	we do, not live in 'one world' but  do	move
zigzag	forward	 to  the view that  the	 uniquely  deterrent
effect of death penalty is, in part, challenged by  jurists,
commissions and statistics.  But as a counterweight we	have
what an outstanding justice of the Ontario appeal court said
some years ago(4)
	      "The   irrevocable  character  of	 the   death
	      penalty is a reason why all possible  measures
	      should be taken against injustice-not for- its
			    abolition.	Nowadays, with the advent
of  armed
	      criminals	 and  the  substantial	increase  in
	      armed robberies, criminals of long standing if
	      arrested,	  must	 expect	  long	  sentences.
</p><p id="p_23">	      However, if they run no risk of hanging,	when
	      found   guilty  of  murder,  they	 will	kill
	      policemen and witnesses with the prospect of a
	      future no more unhappy, as one of them put it.
	      than  being fed, lodged, and clothed  for	 the
	      rest of their lives."

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">338</span>
<p id="p_26">The  final  position,  as we see it,  is  neither  with	 the
absolute abolitionist nor with the Mosaic retributions.	  It
is  relativist,	 and humanist, conditioned by the  sense  of
justice	 and prevailing situation of the given society.	  In
England, men once believed it to be just that a thief should
lose  his life (as some Arab Chieftains do to-day)  but	 the
British	 have  gone abolitionist now  without  regrets.	  In
contemporary  India, the via media of legal  deprivation  of
life being the exception and long deprivation of liberty the
rule fits the social mood and realities and the direction of
the penal and processual laws.
</p><p id="p_27">While,	deterrence  through threat of death may still  be  a
promising  strategy  in some frightful	areas  of  murderous
crime,	to  espouse  a monolithic theory  of  its  deterrent
efficacy  is unscientific and so we think it right to  shift
the emphasis, to accept composite factors of penal  strategy
and not to put all the punitive eggs in the 'hanging' basket
but hopefully to try the humane mix.
</p><p id="p_28">We  assume that a better world is one without legal  knifing
of  life,  given  propitious social changes.   Even  so,  to
sublimate  savagery  in	 individual or	society	 is  a	long
experiment  in	spiritual  chemistry  where  moral   values,
socioeconomic  conditions  and legislative judgment  have  a
role.	Judicial activism can only be a signpost, a  weather
vane,  no  more.   We  think the  penal	 direction  in	this
jurisprudential	 journey points to life prison normally,  as
against	 guillotine,  gas chamber,  electric  chair,  firing
squad  or hangmen's rope.  'Thou shalt not kill' is  a	slow
commandment in law as in life, addressed to citizens as well
as  to States, in peace as in war.  We make this  survey  to
just  if  your	general preference  where  s.302  keeps	 two
options open and the question is of great moment.
Let  us	 crystallise the positive indicators  against  death
sentence under Indian Law currently.  Where the murderer  is
too  young or too old, the clemency of penal  justice  helps
him.  Where the offender suffers from socioeconomic, psychic
or  penal  compulsions	insufficient  to  attract  a   legal
exception  or  to  downgrade the crime into  a	lesser	one,
judicial  commutation is permissible.  Other general  social
pressures,  warranting judicial notice, with an	 extenuating
impact	may,  in special cases, induce the  lesser  penalty.
Extraordinary features in the judicial process, such as that
the  death  sentence has hung over the head of	the  culprit
excruciatingly	 long,	 may  persuade	the  court   to	  be
compassionate.	 Likewise, if others involved in  the  crime
and  similarly	situated have received the benefit  of	life
imprisonment  or  if  the  offence  is	only   constructive,
being  .under<a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_28"> s. 302</a> read with<a href="/doc/1060179/" id="a_29"> s. 149</a>, or again the  accused
has  acted  suddenly under  another's  instigation,  without
premeditation, perhaps the court may humanely opt for  life,
even  like  where a just cause or real suspicion  of  wifely
infidelity pushed the criminal into the crime.	On the other
hand,  the  weapons used and the manner of  their  use,	 the
borrandous features of the crime and hapless, helpless state
of the victim, and the like, steal the heart of the law	 for
a  sterner  sentence.	We  cannot  obviously  feed  into  a
judicial computer all such situations since they are  astro-
logical imponderable in an imperfect and undulating society.
A legal
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">339</span>
policy	on life or death cannot be left for ad hoc  mood  or
individual  predilection and so we have sought to  objectify
to the extent possible, abandoning retributive ruthlessness,
amending the deterrent creed and accenting the trend against
the extreme and irrevocable penalty of putting out life.
</p><p id="p_29">     Here,  the criminal's social and personal	factors	 are
less  harsh, her feminity and youth, her unbalanced sex	 and
expulsion  from the conjugal home and being the mother of  a
young  boy-these individually inconclusive and	cumulatively
marginal facts and circumstances tend towards award of	life
imprisonment.	We  realise the speculative  nature  of	 the
correlation between crime and punishment in this case, as in
many  others, and conscious of fallibility dilute the  death
penalty.   The larger thought that quick punishment,  though
only a life term, is more deterrent than leisurely  judicial
death	award  with  liberal  interposition   of   executive
clemency,  and that stricter checking on illicit weapons  by
the police deters better as social defense against murderous
violence   than	 a  distant  death  sentence,  is   not	  an
