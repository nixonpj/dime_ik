3      At the time of trial, prosecution examined following PW's:­

PW1            Sh. Rakesh Kumar,

PW2            Ct. Balraj,


Case No.49/2/07                  State Vs. Aslam                                2/7

4      During the course of trial, accused C. Raju absconded from the 

</pre><p id="p_3">proceedings and vide separate order dated 01.04.2011 passed by the

 7      As far as evidence led by the prosecution is concerned, PW1 Sh. 

</pre><p id="p_6">Rakesh Kumar is the complainant in this case.   He has,  inter alia, 

testified that on 17.11.2006, he was coming from Rithala to his house 

and   that  at   about   12:10 am  when he reached near CNG Pump, E­

Block,   Shakurpur,   Ring   Road,   one   boy   hit   him   from   behind   by 

throwing brick which hit him on his shoulder.  He has further testified 

that he became unconscious and at that time two persons came to him 

and took his mobile make NOKIA 1100 having number 9811909666, 

one purse containing his driving licence, Debit Card of Corporation 

Bank and also took his gold chain weighing one tola from his neck 

and ran away.  He further testified that he informed the Guard at CNG 

Pump and called the police at no.100 from the mobile of the guard and 

he made complaint Ex.PW1/A to police and the police prepared site 

plan Ex.PW1/B at his instance and that on 28.11.2006, he joined the 

investigation and they went to the spot where accused C. Raju was 

apprehended who made disclosure statement Ex.PW1/C and he was 

arrested vide Ex.PW1/D and later on he came to know that the mobile 

phone was recovered and he got the same released on superdari.  PW2 

Ct. Balraj on receipt of DD No.4B joined the investigation with the IO 

SI Parminder  Singh Rawat.  PW3 Ct. Satish joined the investigation 



Case No.49/2/07                 State Vs. Aslam                            4/7
 with the IO on 28.11.2006 when accused C. Raju was arrested.  PW4 

Ct. Rajender joined the investigation with the IO on 24.12.2006 when 

accused Aslam arrested and the alleged recovery of the mobile phone 

was effected.  PW5 SI Sube Singh is the Duty Officer who recorded 

FIR Ex.PW5/A and made endorsement Ex.PW5/B on the ruqqa.  PW6 

Ct. Surajveer is the DD Writer who recorded DD No.4B Ex.PW6/A. 

PW7 SI Parminder Singh Rawat is the IO in this case.  He has testified 

about   the   proceedings   of   the   case   in   detail.       PW8   Sh.   Bhupesh 

Kumar, the then Ld. Metropolitan Magistrate, is the witness pertaining 

to TIP of accused Tang Raj S/o Jagganath.     Opportunities to cross­ 

examine the witnesses were given to the accused persons which were 

duly availed of by them.   
</p>
<p id="p_7">

8       In this case, PW1 Sh. Rakesh Kumar is the complainant.  If the 

testimony of this witness, as referred to hereinabove, is analyzed qua 

the   allegations   against   accused   Aslam,     it   is   crystal   clear   that   this 

witness has not whispered a single word qua accused Aslam.  It is the 

case of the prosecution that accused Aslam along with other accused 

persons   committed   theft   of   NOKIA   Phone   and   purse   of   the 

complainant and also that accused C. Raju (PO) and accused Aslam 



Case No.49/2/07                     State Vs. Aslam                                   5/7
 forcefully   taken   the   said   articles   from   the   complainant   and   while 

doing so, they caused voluntary hurt on his person.  In the light of the 

allegations, the testimony of PW1 must be straight forward but the 

same is not like so.   This witness has kept mum on all vital aspects. 

This witness has neither seen the offenders nor the recovery has been 

effected from his presence.  It is the allegations against accused Aslam 

that   the   stolen   mobile   was   recovered   from   his   possession   but   no 

independent public witness has been included at the time of alleged 

recovery.  Even the complainant was not asked to join the said alleged 

recovery.   So far as the testimonies of other witnesses are concerned, 

they   are   police/formal   witnesses   whose   role   came   into   picture 

subsequently after the incident.  
</p>
<p id="p_8">

9      On   other   aspects   also   the   different   witnesses   have   shown 

several   other   discrepancies   and   contradictions   in   the   case   of   the 

prosecution and have raised further doubt regarding correctness of the 

same. Testimonies of different witnesses are not in complete harmony 

with each other and there are several diversions amongst them. </p><pre id="pre_5">



10     If   the  testimony of PW1 and other material    relevant  in this 



Case No.49/2/07                  State Vs. Aslam                               6/7
</pre><p id="p_9"> regard are perused, it becomes clear that the allegations qua accused 

Aslam have not been conclusively established on record.



11       Hence, in the given facts and circumstances, accused Aslam is 

acquitted.   Bail bond and surety bond stand cancelled. Surety stands 

discharged.     Original  documents, if any be returned to the rightful 

owner against proper receipt. Superdarinama stands cancelled.   The 

case property, if any be released to the rightful owner.   



12     In this case, accused C. Raju is proclaimed offender.  Hence the 

matter is adjourned  sine die  and the file be consigned to the Record 

Room   and   be   revived   as   and  when   accused   C.   Raju  appears   or  is 

apprehended.
