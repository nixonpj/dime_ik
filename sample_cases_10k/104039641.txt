         landlord qua the respondent.  Hence, the petitioner has no locus standi

        to file the present eviction petition and that the documents filed by the

        petitioner   does   not   disclose   anything   as   regards   ownership   of   the

        petitioner qua the tenanted premises. That  the sale deed filed by the

        petitioner in order to claim the ownership of the tenanted premises has

        been executed by her own husband in her favour and it is apparently a

        sham   document   which   has   been   created   for   the   sake   of   seeking

        eviction of the tenants and the said intention of the petitioner is clearly

        visible   from   the   fact   that   the   present   petition   has   been   filed

        immediately after expiry of statutory period of   5 years from the date of

        sale deed.

        months ago to Mr. Shakir who is  running his business of selling shoes

        from the said shop and as such it is apparent from the said act of the

        petitioner that the petitioner has tried to create a semblance of need for

        the purpose of this petition. 
</p>
<p id="p_14">         D.That the petitioner has deliberately concealed the material fact that

        her   younger   son   namely   Mr.   Mohit   Verma   is   already   running   a

        Jewelery   business   under   the   name   and   style   of   "Amar   Suhaag

        Jewelers" from one of the four shops. Similarly, the elder son namely

        Mr. Pardeep Kumar is also running his jewelery business from one of

        the said shops under the name and style of "M/s. Paras Chandi Ghar".

         E.That son of the petitioner, Mr. Pradeep Kumar is living separately

        business. 
</p>
<p id="p_17">6.      The petitioner has filed a reply to the application for Leave to Defend

along with counter affidavit and in the counter affidavit she has  denied the

defenses taken by the respondent and has categorically denied that the elder

son of the petitioner namely Pardeep Kumar is running a business from one

of the shops under the name and style of 'M/s. Paras Chandi Ghar".  It has

been submitted by the petitioner that she is the proprietor of M/s Amar Suhag

Jewelers and that his husband is the proprietor of M/s Paras Chandi Ghar.

the Hon'ble Supreme Court titled as "<a href="/doc/1703207/" id="a_3">Satyawati Sharma v. Union of India</a>"

AIR   2008   SUPREME   COURT   3148  so   as   to   include   premises   let   out   for

commercial   purposes   also   within   the   scope   and   ambit   of   a   petition   under

section 14(1)(e) of DRC Act. 
</p>
<p id="p_22">10.     The defences taken by respondent are discussed below and the same

are as under:­

     
 1      Petitioner is not the owner of the tenanted premises
                                                            

         1.1 The respondent has contended that the petitioner is not the owner

        of the tenanted premises however at the same time the respondent

        has   not   denied   the   execution   of   sale   deed   dated   29.09.06   by   the

        husband of the petitioner in her favour.   The respondent has merely

        submitted   that   the   said   registered   Sale   Deed   is   a   sham   document

        which has been fabricated by the petitioner in order to evict tenants in

        the premises. 
</p>
<p id="p_23">         1.2 In rent control legislation, the landlord can be said to be owner, if

        he is entitled in his own legal right, as distinguished from for and on

        behalf of someone else, to evict the tenant and then to retain, control,

        hold and use the premises for himself.
</p>
<p id="p_24">         1.3 In M.M.Quasim Vs Manohar Lal Sharma (1981) 3 SCC 36 it was
        observed   by   the   Apex   Court   that   an   "owner­landlord"     can   seek

        eviction on the ground of his personal requirement is one who has a

E.No. 45/12       Smt. Prem Lata Verma Vs. Sh. Narain Dass Chawla              Page no. 6 of 19
         right against the whole world to occupy the building in his own right

        and exclude anyone holding a title lesser than his own. 

         1.4 It   was   observed   in  Shanti   Sharma   Vs   Smt   Ved   Prabha   AIR
        1987   SC   2028  that   the   term   "owner"   has   to   be   understood   in   the

        context of the background of the law and what is contemplated in the

        scheme  of  the   Act.  <a href="/doc/1403255/" id="a_4">The  Act</a> has been   enacted  for protection  of the

        tenants. But, at the same time, it has provided that the landlord under

        certain   circumstances   will   be   entitled   to   eviction   and   bona   fide

        requirement   is   one   of   such   grounds.   Ordinarily,   the   concept   of   the

        ownership may be absolute ownership in the land as well as of the

        structure standing thereon. But in the modern context, where all lands

        belong   to   the   State,   the   persons   who   hold   properties   will   only   be

        lessees   or   the   persons   holding   the   land   on   some   term   from   the

        Government or the authorities constituted by the State. The legislature,

        when it used the term "owner" in<a href="/doc/919304/" id="a_5"> s. 14(1)(e)</a>, did not think of ownership

        as absolute ownership.  The meaning of the term "owner" is vis­a­

        vis the tenant i.e. the owner should be something more than the

        tenant. In cases where the plot of land is taken on lease, the structure

        is built by the landlord and he is the owner of the structure. 

         1.5 In  Sushil   Kanta   Chakravarty   Vs   Rajeshwar   Kumar   2000   (2)

        RCR Rent 4  it was observed that where there was an agreement to

        sell and so also a power of attorney in favour of the purchaser landlord

        and   he   had   been   given   possession   by   virtue   of   the   said   power   of

        attorney, it was held that he could maintain a petition for eviction.

          1.6 Coming   to   the   facts   of   the   present   case,   the   respondent   has

        himself   admitted   that   he   was   a   tenant   under   the   landlordship   of

        husband   of   petitioner   since   1966   from   which   an   inference   can   be

        drawn that the husband of the petitioner was the owner of the tenanted

        premises.  The husband of the petitioner sold a portion of the property

        including the tenanted premises to the petitioner on 29.09.06 vide a

        registered   Sale   Deed   for   which   proper   stamp   duty   and   other   taxes

        were paid by the petitioner and therefore merely because there is a

        sale   transaction   between   the   petitioner   and   her   husband   does   not

        mean that the said transaction is a sham transaction or a transaction

        without consideration. Moreover, the submission of the respondent that

        the petitioner has fabricated the sale deed in order to evict the tenant

        does not hold force because even in the absence of the sale deed the

        husband of the petitioner could have filed an eviction petition against

        the respondent for settling his son Mr. Pardeep Kumar.

         1.7   As regards landlordship, the respondent has himself relied upon

        rent   receipts   filed   by   the   petitioner   and   the   petitioner   has   filed   rent

        receipts in which earlier the husband of the petitioner was shown as

        landlord   and   later   the   petitioner   was   shown   as   landlord   and   these

        receipts do bear the counter signatures of the respondent.  

         1.8 Thus, the Court is of the opinion that the respondent has failed to

        raise any triable issue both as regards the ownership of the tenanted

        premises   (in   view   of   the   registered   sale   deed)   and   as   regards   the

        landlordship of the tenanted premises (in view of the rent receipts duly

        landlord). 
</p>
<p id="p_25">         1.9 Thus, this defence raised by the respondent does not raise any

        triable issue.

</p><p id="p_27">         2.1 In leave to defend, respondent has taken objection that the site

        plan of the tenanted premises is not correct.  However, no reason has

        been assigned by the respondent  in the application as to how the site

        plan filed by the petitioner is incorrect.  
</p>
<p id="p_28">         2.2 On   the   other   hand,   the   contention   of   petitioner   is   that   since

        respondent has not filed any contrary site plan showing the details of

        tenanted   premises   thus,   the   plea   of   the   respondent   as   regards  site

        plan of petitioner is vague and baseless.  
</p>
<p id="p_29">         2.3 In this regard, reliance can be placed on judgment titled as V. S.

        Sachdeva   Vs.   M.   L.   Grover,   67   (1997)   DLT   737,   wherein   Hon'ble

        Delhi High Court has observed as under:
</p>
<p id="p_30">                         "if, the tenant failed to file any site plan, then the site plan filed

                         by the landlord should be accepted"
</p>
<p id="p_31">         2.5 In the absence of any contrary site plan of the respondent, plea of

        the respondent is rejected being bald averment without any substance.

        Moreover,   there   is   no   dispute   between   the   parties   as   regards   the

        tenanted   premises   and   as   regards   tenancy.   Rather   it   has   been

        submitted by the respondent himself that he is in possession of the

        tenanted premises since 1966. Further it has not been stated by the



E.No. 45/12       Smt. Prem Lata Verma Vs. Sh. Narain Dass Chawla                Page no. 9 of 19
         respondent in leave to defend as to how the site plan is incorrect.

         2.6 An issue was also raised by the respondent that the shop no. 3 is

        not in his occupation and the shop number has wrongly mentioned by

        the petitioner.  It may be noted here that the shop number as stated in

        the petition is not the municipal number provided to the shop by the

        concerned authority and as the site plan qua the location of the shop is

        not disputed,  hence, the site plan fled by the petitioner aptly describes

        the property under the tenancy of the respondent.

         2.7 Thus, this defence raised by the respondent does not raise any

        triable issue as the tenanted premises is identifiable from the site plan

        filed by the petitioner.

         3.1 Respondent   has   challenged   the   bonafide   requirement   of   the
        petitioner   on   the   ground   that   Mr.   Pardeep   Kumar,   elder   son   of   the

        petitioner  is already running   a shop  under  the  name  &amp; style  of M/s

        Paras Chandi Ghar and further that about six months before the filing

        of application under consideration, the petitioner had let out one of the

        four shops to one Mr. Shakir who is running the business of selling

        shoes in the said shop.

        Shakir is very old and that it has been indicated in the site plan that

        one of the four shops is occupied by another tenant.   The petitioner

        also submitted that as the shop in the possession of Shakir is owned

        by her husband,  therefore, the fact that the said shop has been let out

         to   Mr.   Shakir   cannot   be   considered   in   the   present   petition.     The

        petitioner also submitted that she herself is the proprietor of M/s Amar

        Suhag Jewelers and that her husband is the proprietor of M/s Paras

        Chandi Ghar and in this respect the petitioner also filed on record her

        income tax return wherein she has been shown as proprietor of M/s

        Amar   Suhag   Jewelers   and   the   income   tax   returns   of   her   husband

        wherein   her   husband   has   been   shown   as   proprietor   of   M/s   Paras

        show that Pardeep Kumar, elder son of the petitioner is running the

        shop in the name &amp; style of M/s Paras Chandi Ghar. 
</p>
<p id="p_35">         3.4 By merely stating that the son of the petitioner is running a shop,
        the   respondent   cannot   obtain   leave   to   defend   because   if   leave   to

        defend is permitted on mere assertion than in every such case tenant

        would state in his leave to defend that the son of the landlord/landlady

        is either running a business or is employed somewhere and drawing

        handsome salary and thereby obtain leave to defend.   However, this

        was not the  intent of  legislature  while  incorporating  <a href="/doc/1403255/" id="a_6">Section  25</a>­B of

        DRC   Act   as   allowing   leave   to   defends   on   mere   assertions   would

        frustrate the very object of <a href="/doc/1403255/" id="a_7">Section 25</a>­B DRC Act. In this context it has

                       respect of specified category of cases as provided therein. Where
                       a landlord seeks eviction on the basis of  bona fide  necessity, a
                       summary procedure is provided and tenant has to seek leave to
                       defend disclosing such facts which disentitled the landlord from
                       seeking   eviction.   Where   a   tenant   pleads,   in   leave   to   defend
                       preposterous prepositions and makes such averments which are
                       palpably  false and the landlord in  his  reply affidavit to leave  to
                       defend is able to show to the ARC that all facts stated in leave to
                       defend,   were   palpably   false,   ARC   is   not   precluded   from
                       considering   the   falsity   of   such   facts   on   the   basis   of   material
                       placed by  the landlord  before  it.   If the tenant in  its leave  to
                       defend  pleads that landlord was owner of another premises
                       with which landlord had nothing to do, mere filing of affidavit
                       is not sufficient.  The tenant has to place before the learned
                       ARC   such   documents   which   show   that   the   landlord   was
                       owner of that premises.   If no such document is placed on
                       record   by   the   tenant,   the   learned   ARC   is   not   required   to
                       consider the ownership of the landlord of such a premises.

        raised by the respondent does not raise any triable issue.

         3.8 It has also been alleged by the respondent in the leave to defend,
        Pardeep Kumar, elder son of the petitioner is living separately and that

        the petitioner has no responsibility of settling him.  However, the Court

        is of the different opinion in this regard.   In a recent judgment it has

         been observed by our own High Court that it is the moral duty of a

        father to help establish his son. The relevant portion of the judgment

        titled  Pawan  Kumar   Vs   Sant   Lal   R.C.Rev   303/2012   decided   on

        6.8.2012 by Honorable Mr Justice M.L.Mehta is as under:­

              "16. Further, submissions of learned counsel for the petitioner that Dr. Ankit
              was not financially dependent upon his father and so the tenanted premises
              could not be got vacated for his requirement, is also only noted for rejection. It
              is trite that the landlord is entitled to help his son, establish his business.  In
              Labhu Lal Vs. Sandhya Gupta 2011(1) RCR,(Rent) 231 (Delhi), it has been
              held by this Court that the children are very much dependant on the landlord
              for   the   purpose   of   setting   up   their   business   and   such   a   requirement   is   a
              bonafide   one.  The   right   of   the   landlord   for   possession   of   his   property   for
              setting up a business for his son has been also recognized by the Apex Court
              in Ram Babu Aggarwal Vs. Jay Kishan Das 2009(2) RCR 455.  The moral
              duty of a father to help establish his son  was also recognized by the Apex
              Court in Joginder Pal Singh Vs. Naval Kishore Behal AIR 2002 SC 2256 in
              the following words:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_4">                          "24........Keeping   in   view   the   social   or   socio­religious   milieu   and
                          practices prevalent in a particular section of society or a particular
                          region,   to   which   the   landlord   belongs,  it   may   be   obligation   of   the
                          landlord to settle a person closely connected with him to make him
                          economically   independent   so   as   to   support   himself   and/or   the
                          landlord. To discharge such obligation the landlord may require the
                          tenancy premises and such requirement would be the requirement of
                          the landlord. If the requirement is of actual user of the premises by a
                          person   other   than   the   landlord   himself   the   Court   shall   with
                          circumspection inquire : (i) whether the requirement of such person
                          can   be   considered   to   be   the   requirement   of   the   landlord,   and   (ii)
                          whether there is a close inter­relation or identify nexus between such
                          person and the landlord so as to satisfy the requirement of the first
                          query. Applying the overlaid tests to the facts of the present case it is
                          clear   that   the   tenancy   premises   are   required   for   the   office   of   the
                          landlord's son who is a chartered accountant. It is the moral obligation
                          of the landlord to settle his son well in his life and to contribute his
                          best to see him economically independent."

        mother who is capable and willing to settle her son.

        Behal AIR 2002 SC 2256  (as referred to in aforesaid judgment) the

        situation was similar to the present case, as in the said case before the

        Apex court the landlord had filed eviction petition for the office of his

        son   who   was   a   chartered   accountant   who   was   residing   with   him.

        Honorable Mr. Justice R.C. Lahoti observed in the said judgment that

        such a requirement of the landlord is a genuine requirement . In the

        said case the Apex Court evicted the tenant from the premises for the

        said requirement of the landlord.

        the landlord petitioner for the business of her son Pardeep Kumar, who

        wants to start a business of electronic items in the tenanted premises. 

         3.12 As regards experience for starting a business, in the judgment

                        that the main ground for rejecting the landlord's petition for eviction
                        was that in the petition the landlord had alleged that he required the
                        premises for his son Giriraj who wanted to do footwear business in

                        helping   his   father   in   the   cloth   business,   hence   there   was   no
                        bonafide need. We are of the opinion that a person can start a

        that   requirement   of   landlord   for   setting   up   his   son   who   has   no

        experience   in   business   is   a   bona   fide   requirement.     Thus,   it   is   no

        defence that the petitioner's son has no experience in the business of

        electronic items.
</p>
<p id="p_42">         3.14  Every parent wants to settle his/her children in the best possible
        manner and if the petitioner has found it proper to help her son to start

        her business at the tenanted premises, then it would not be proper for

        the court to interfere in such decision of the petitioner, as the petitioner

        is the best judge of her own requirements and that of the requirements

        of her family including her son.

        Machinary</a>   reported   as   AIR   2000   SUPREME   COURT   534  the

        Hon'ble Supreme Court held that it is settled position of law that the

        landlord   is  best   judge   of   his  requirement   for   residential   or   business

        purpose and he has got complete freedom in the matter. Reference be

                        that the  requirement of the landlord for occupation of the tenanted
                        premises must be bona fide. When a landlord asserts that he requires
                        his   building   for   his   own   occupation   the   Rent   Controller   shall   not

                         It is often said by Courts that it is not for the tenant to dictate terms to
                         the   landlord   as   to   how   else   he   can   adjust   himself   without   getting
                         possession of the tenanted premises. While deciding the question of
                         bona fides of the requirement of the landlord it is quite unnecessary to
                         make an endeavour as to how else the landlord could have adjusted

         3.17 Thus, this defence raised by the respondent as regards bonafide

        commercial   premises   for   her   need   and   the   need   of   her   family

        members.  However, the respondent has not referred or specified any

        other property except the four shops shown in the site plan filed by the

        petitioner herself.  
</p>
<p id="p_48">         4.2 The respondent has also admitted that out of four shops one shop

        is in his possession and one shop is in possession of the other tenant.

        As   regards   the   remaining   two   shops,   the   petitioner   is   running   her

        business in the name and style of M/s Amar Suhag jewelers from one

        shop and  the husband of the petitioner is running his business in the

         provide   space   to   her   son   to   start   the   business   of   electronic   items,

        despite being the owner of the tenanted premises in possession of the

        tenant/respondent.
</p>
<p id="p_50">        Thus, this defence raised by the respondent is a sham defense and it

        does not raise any triable issue.
</p>
<p id="p_51">   Tenanted

respondent to carry out his business and to earn his livelihood:­

         5.1 The respondent has taken the defence that he is doing commercial

        activity   in   the   tenanted   premises   and   that   it   is   the   only   means   of

        livelihood for the tenant.
</p>
<p id="p_52">         5.2 In the opinion of the court,  the said defence has no relevance to

        the issue at hand as it is not the livelihood of the tenant which is to be

        looked into by the court in these proceedings, rather, the court is to

        look   into   whether   the   tenant   has   disclosed   some   facts   which   may

        disentitle   the   landlord   from   obtaining   an   order   for   recovery   of

        possession. 
</p>
<p id="p_53">         5.3 The   fact   that   the   tenanted   premises   is   the   only   source   of
        livelihood   of   respondent   does   not   render   the   landlord/petitioner

        disentitled to eviction of respondent from the tenanted premises. There

        is no provision in the DRC Act to evaluate the comparative hardships

        and comparative need between the landlord and tenant for deciding

        eviction petition. (Harbhajan Dass Vs Tilak Raj Mehta 1980 RCJ 780

        Delhi) 

         5.4 Thus, this defence raised by the respondent does not raise any

         triable issue.
</p>
<p id="p_54">Conclusion

</p><p id="p_55">11.     It is well settled that leave to defend is granted to the tenant in case

any triable issue is raised by him, which can be adjudicated by consideration

of   additional   evidence.   The   mere  existence   of   any   triable   issue   is   not

sufficient. The nature of the triable issue raised by the tenant  must be such

that it will disentitle the landlord from obtaining the eviction order.

                         by   the   landlord   of   the   premises   for   his   own   occupation;   a   special
                         category of  landlords requiring the premises for their own use has
                         been  created;   if there   is any  breach  by  the   landlord,   the  tenant   is
                         given a right of restoration of possession; the landlord who evicts a

 25B of the Act would otherwise be defeated. The prayer for leave to contest

should   be   granted   to   the  tenant  only  where  a  prima   facie  case  has  been

disclosed by him. In the absence of the tenant having disclosed a prima facie

case i.e. such facts which disentitles the landlord from obtaining an order of
