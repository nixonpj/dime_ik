In the High Court of Punjab and Haryana at Chandigarh


                          Date of Decision: 5.9.2018.

<p id="p_1">              This order will dispose of RSA Nos. 4387 and 4797 of 2014 as

identical questions of law and fact are involved for adjudication and the

same have emerged out of the common judgments and decrees passed by

the courts.
</p>
<p id="p_2">              The present lis pertains to inheritance to the estate of Arjan

Singh (since deceased) who admittedly left behind his widow, four

daughters namely Jaspal Kaur, Jarnail Kaur, Nachhattar Kaur, Paramjit Kaur

and one son namely Sh. Jagtar Singh. Sham Kaur and others filed Civil Suit

No. 793 dated 7.3.2003 claiming inheritance to the estate of Sh. Arjan

Singh on the basis of natural succession whereas the defendants-appellants,

successors-in-interest of Sh. Jagtar Singh son of Arjan Singh propounded

Will dated 24.12.1985 purported to be executed by the deceased, to the

exclusion of other class -I heirs i.e., widow and daughters of said Arjan

Singh. The Courts have discarded will dated 24.12.1985 propounded by the

appellants.
</p>
<p id="p_3">              Counsel for the appellants would argue that the original Will

got misplaced as the same was produced for the purpose of sanction of

mutation. The appellants filed an application for permission to lead

secondary evidence to prove the Will in question and the same was allowed.

It is argued that the courts have wrongly rejected the Will for the reason

that the original Will has not been produced on record.

</p><p id="p_4">              I have heard counsel for the appellants, perused the paper

books and records.
</p>
<p id="p_5">              Indisputably, two civil suits filed by different set of parties but

raising the same controversy with regard to inheritance to the estate of Sh.

Arjan Singh were decided together vide judgment and decree dated 8.2.2013

passed by the trial court and two separate appeals preferred by the

appellants to assail the judgment and decree dated 8.2.2013 did not find

favour with the Additional District Judge, Moga.

</p><p id="p_6">              Perusal of the judgments would reveal that there is no dispute

between the parties with regard to relationship of Sham Kaur and others

with Sh. Arjan Singh and so also Sh. Arjan Singh had one son namely

Jagtar Singh (since deceased), succeeded by Smt. Daljit Kaur widow and

Balwinder Singh son. The primary dispute between the parties is, whether


                                       2 of 3

the deceased left behind Will dated 24.12.1985 in favour of Jagtar Singh,

his son. Counsel would fairly concede that the appellants did not examine

either of the attesting witnesses of the Will to prove the same, in accordance

with <a href="/doc/63662/" id="a_1">Section 68</a> of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 (in short "the Act"). The

trial court in para 23 has adverted to the requirements of <a href="/doc/63662/" id="a_2">Sections 68</a> and

<a href="/doc/613078/" id="a_3">69</a> of the Act for proving a document which requires attestation in law. As

the appellants failed to prove the Will, in accordance with law, no error

much less perversity can be found in consistent findings of the courts

rejecting the Will dated 24.12.1985 and allowing inheritance to the estate of

Sh. Arjan Singh, on the basis of natural succession in the light of provisions

of the <a href="/doc/685111/" id="a_4">Hindu Succession Act</a>, 1956.
</p>
<p id="p_7">            For the foregoing reasons, the appeals fail and accordingly

dismissed in limine. No order as to costs.</p><pre id="pre_2">
