                (<a href="/doc/120682730/" id="a_1">Goverdhan vs. The State of Madhya Pradesh</a>)

Indore, Dated:14/05/2018
             Shri N.K. Soni, learned counsel for the applicant.
             Shri Pankaj Wadhwani, learned Public Prosecutor for the
respondent/State.</pre>
<p id="p_1">             Heard, Case-diary perused.
</p><p id="p_2">             This is a (repeat) application under Section 439, <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_2">Cr.P.C</a> for
grant of bail in connection with Crime No.799/2017, Police Station
Industrial Area, District Dewas, concerning offence under <a href="/doc/764237/" id="a_3">Sections
394</a>, <a href="/doc/1865807/" id="a_4">216(A)</a> of IPC read with <a href="/doc/73862/" id="a_5">Section 25</a>, <a href="/doc/244673/" id="a_6">27</a> of Arms Act, 1959. First
application came to be dismissed as withdrawn, vide order dated
13/04/2018 passed in M.Cr.C. No. 14098/2018.
</p><p id="p_3">             As per prosecution story, on 21/12/2017, complainant
along with cleaner Parvez was driving truck no. RJ 33 GA 0364 from
Rajasthan. When he reached Dewas to deliver goods loaded in his
truck, he alighted from the vehicle for enquiring about the delivery
address, at that time, two unknown persons come on a motorcylce
caught hold of him and one forcefully elongated pistol below his left
eye, due to which he got injured below his left eye. Another accused
snatched Rs.2500/-, photocopy of RC Book and photocopy of affidavit
of truck and ran away from the spot.
</p><p id="p_4">             Learned counsel for the applicant has submitted that the
applicant is not named in the F.I.R. Although in the Test Identification
Parade, complainant identified the applicant, however, in Court,
statement, neither the complainant has identified the applicant nor
stated anything against him. It is alleged that the robbed property of
Rs.1300/- and photocopy of affidavit with respect to truck No.RJ 33
GA 0364 has been recovered on the basis of disclosure statement of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">           M.Cr.C. No.17133/2018                                                2</span>




          recorded under <a href="/doc/1312051/" id="a_7">Section 27</a> of the Evidence Act, however these articles
          have been recovered from a open place therefore it is not enough to
          implicate the present applicant in the present crime.        Applicant is in
          custody since 22/12/2017 and conclusion of trial will take considerable
          time. Lastly it is submitted that co-accused Keshari has been granted
          bail by this Court vide order dated 25/04/2018 passed in M.Cr.C.
          No.14090/2018 and the case of the present applicant is similar to that
          of co-accused.         Under these circumstances, counsel prays for grant of
          bail to the applicant.
</p><p id="p_5">                       Learned Public Prosecutor submits that no sufficient
          ground is made out for releasing the applicant on bail, hence the
          application filed by the applicant be dismissed.
</p><p id="p_6">                       Considering the facts and circumstances of the case and the
          arguments advanced by learned counsel for the parties, but without
          commenting on the merits of the case, the application filed by the
          applicant is allowed. The applicant is directed to be released on bail
          on his furnishing a personal bond in the sum of Rs.50,000/-(Rupees
          fifty thousand Only), with one solvent surety of the like amount to
          the satisfaction of trial Court, for his regular appearance before the
          trial Court during trial with a condition that he shall remain present
          before the Court concerned during trial and shall also abide by the
          conditions enumerated under <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_8">Section 437</a> (3) of <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_9">Cr.P.C</a>.
