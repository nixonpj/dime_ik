                 W.P.(C) No.4236 of 2014-D
             ----------------------------------------------
           Dated this the 23rd day of May, 2014

<p id="p_1">     The petitioner, owner of a commercial building by the

side of a public road complains of unauthorised parking of

contract vehicles and auto rickshaws by the side of the road

and in front of his building completely blocking his road

frontage and means of access.             Exhibit P3 photographs

show the manner in which the vehicles are parked.

According to Sri Shaji P. Chaly who appears for the

petitioner, the illegal acts of the vehicles completely

diminishes the utility of his property, the road frontage

being the most important amenity that is available to him.

Therefore, he seeks the issue of appropriate directions for

removal of the obstructions.
</p>
<p id="p_2">     2.    The 6th respondent has filed a statement.

Paragraph 2 of the said statement reads as follows:-

</p><p id="p_3">            2.   It is hereby submitted that stringent action

      will be taken in the event of the parking in front of the

W.P.(C) No.4236 of 2014-D

      petitioner's building as it is causing any obstruction to

      the free flow of traffic.     No approval is granted for

      establishment of an autorickshaw stand in front of the

      petitioner's building.   The co-operation of the Local

      Government Institution is absolutely necessary for

      establishment of an approved parking place.          This

      respondent is regularly maintaining the traffic at

      Mundakkyam Town and special attention is being taken

      to ensure free flow of traffic.
</p>
<p id="p_4">      3.    A counter affidavit has been filed by the second

respondent.         According to the second respondent, the

petitioner's building is abutting the National Highway 220.

Therefore, the said respondent does not have any authority

to remove the unauthorised parking. Paragraphs 4 and 5 of

the counter affidavit read as follows:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">      4.     The allegation raised in paragraphs 1 to 5 and

      Grounds A to R are misleading, not correct hence denied.

      It is humbly submitted that the building owned by the

      petitioner referred to in Para 1 of the Writ Petition is

      situated at the side of National Highway 220. Earlier the

      said road was the Kottayam-Kumily Road (K.K.Road)

      which was a State Highway.          Later the same was

      upgraded as a National Highway connecting Kollam-

      Theni Road. It is learnt that presently the administration

      of the said road is entrusted with the 4th respondent-

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                   -:3:-</span>
</blockquote><p id="p_5">W.P.(C) No.4236 of 2014-D

      Executive       Engineer     (N.H.)    Roads    Division,

      Moovattupuzha      and   with     the Assistant Executive

      Engineer (N.H) Roads Division, Kanjirappally.      In the

      above circumstances it can be seen that the above road

      is not one which is vested with the 2nd respondent-

      Panchayat under the provisions of Kerala Panchayat Raj

      Act and hence the Panchayat does not have an

      administrative authority over the said road.

</p><p id="p_6">      5.     It is further humbly submitted that so far no

      parking stand as provided under the provisions of the

      Kerala Panchayat Raj (Landing Places, and Halting

      Places and Cart Stands and other Vehicles Stands) Rules,

      1995 also is provided in the road margin situated in front

      of the building of the petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_7">      4.    I have heard Advocate Shaji P.Chaly who appears

for the petitioner, the learned Government Pleader as well

as Sri.Liji J. Vadakedom who appears for the second

respondent. Though notice has been served on the other

respondents, there is no appearance for them.

</p><p id="p_8">      5.    The pleadings clearly show that, no parking

facility has been designated by the second respondent who

is the competent authority, in front of the petitioner's

building. It is also stated that, the road itself is part of the

W.P.(C) No.4236 of 2014-D

National Highway 220, the control of which is with the

National Highway Authority of India. Therefore, it is stated

that the 4th respondent is the competent authority to remove

the obstruction that has been caused.
</p>
<p id="p_9">      6.    The authority that is competent to regulate traffic

on the Highways and to take action for unauthorised

parking of vehicles is the 5th respondent and his

subordinates.           According   to the petitioner, though

representations have been submitted to all the authorities,

there has been no action to remove the obstruction. The

parking of autorickshaws and other commercial vehicles

clearly obstruct the entry into the parking space that has

been provided by the petitioner to his building. The shop

rooms that form part of the building are also rendered

inaccessible. It cannot be disputed that respondents 4 and

5 have a duty to ensure that such unauthorised acts and

obstructions as seen in Exhibit P3 photographs are not

created.     It is only appropriate that the authorities take

effective action to keep the frontage of the petitioner's

building free of any such obstruction.

</p><p id="p_10">      For the above reasons, this writ petition is allowed.

Respondents 4 and 5 are directed to ensure that no

commercial vehicles or autorickshaws are parked in front of

the petitioner's building causing obstruction to the

enjoyment thereof by the petitioner and his tenants and the

public who frequent the establishments functioning from

the building in the manner visible in Exhibit P3. It shall be

done effectively, if necessary, by displaying "No Parking"

boards or by other suitable methods and by initiating stern

action against the offenders.
