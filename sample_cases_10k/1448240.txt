                            ---------------------
             Dated this the 30thday of September, 2008

                              JUDGMENT
</pre>


<p id="p_1">          This appeal is preferred against the award passed by the

Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Tirur, in OP(MV) 182/00.          The

claimant, aged 37 years a bus conductor by profession, sustained

injuries in a road accident. It is the case of the claimant that when

the bus reached Vaidyermoola a jeep was seen parked on the

eastern side of the road. Being the conductor of the said bus he was

looking for the space of the road by putting his head through the door

of the bus. But, before he had given signal, the driver of the bus had

accelerated the bus whereby his hand forcefully hit against a

telephone post which resulted in fracture of his hand. The Insurance

Company would strongly contend that it was the conductor of the bus

who had contributed to the accident by putting his hand outside and

therefore the claimant is not entitled to any compensation.

</p><p id="p_2">          2. At the outset I may like to point out that the driver as

well as the conductor, who are the members of the crew, have got a

paramount duty to take the passengers to the destination safely and

comfortably. When a jeep is seen parked on the side of the road, the

driver of the bus has to be meticulously careful to see that the

transgression does not result in injury to anybody. There is nothing

wrong in the conductor being anxious to see that the driver did not

commit the mistake.       Since the bus is plying through the route

everyday, the driver is expected to be conscious of the factum of the

existence of a telephone post on the side of the road. So with that in

mind he was expected to drive the vehicle. When the driver feels

that there will be real difficulty to cross the road without touching the

telephone post ordinarily he is expected to either slow down the bus

or stop the bus, get the clearance and then proceed. The allegation

in this case is that when the conductor was in the process of looking

for that clearance, the driver accelerated the bus which resulted in

the accident.
</p>
<p id="p_3">          3. I cannot find fault with the conductor for the reason that

he was only exercising the act which he is expected to do in order to

avoid a hit on the telephone post by the bus. If the driver of the bus

had been slow and cautious and had kept a reasonable distance

from the telephone post certainly, the conductor's hand would not

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                  3</span>

have come into contact with the said post. So, I cannot hold that the

conductor has contributed to the accident resulting in injuries to him.

The Tribunal has approached the matter only in the correct

perspective and had arrived at a proper decision.

</p><p id="p_4">         Therefore, the appeal lacks merit and the same is

dismissed.
