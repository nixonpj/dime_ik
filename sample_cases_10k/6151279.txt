                            man­       The   'reasonable   doubt'   is   one   which   occurs   to   a   prudent   and
                            reasonable   man.     <a href="/doc/1092263/" id="a_23">Section   3</a>   while   explaining  the   meaning   of   the   words
                            'proof', disproved' and 'not proved' lays down the standard of proof, namely
                            about the existence or non­existence of the circumstances from the point of
                            view of a prudent man. The section is so worded as to provide for two
                            conditions of mind, first, that in which a man feels absolutely certain of a
                            fact, in other words, 'believe it to exist' and secondly in which, though he
                            may not feel absolutely certain of a fact, he thinks it so extremely probable
                            that a prudent man would under the circumstances act on the assumption of
                            its  existence.   The act while adopting the requirement of the prudent man
                            as an appropriate concrete standard by which to measure proof at the same
                            time  contemplates  of   giving   full   effect  to   be   given   to   circumstances  or
                            condition of probability or improbability. It is this degree of certainty to be
                            arrived where the circumstances before a fact can be said to be proved.  A
                            fact is said to be disproved when the court believes that it does not exist or
                            considers its non­existence so probable in the view of a prudent  man the
                            fact is not proved,    i.e. neither  proved    nor  disproved.    It is this doubt


State Vs. Balak Ram and another
SC No.81/2012
                             which  occurs  to a  reasonable   man,  has legal  recognition   in the   field  of
                            criminal disputes.  It is something different from moral conviction and it is
                            also     different   from   a   suspicion.     It   is   the   result   of   a   process   of   keen
                            examination of the entire material on record by  'a prudent man'."
