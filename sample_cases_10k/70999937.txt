HIGH COURT OF JUDICATURE AT ALLAHABAD
 
 

?Court No. - 32
 

 
Case :- SPECIAL APPEAL DEFECTIVE No. - 899 of 2019
 

 
Appellant :- India Oil Corporation Ltd. And 4 Others
 
Respondent :- Jagannath Prasad And Another
 
Counsel for Appellant :- Anand Tiwari
 
Counsel for Respondent :- A.S.G.I.,Dr. Akhilesh Kumar
 

 
Hon'ble Shashi Kant Gupta,J.
</pre> 
<p id="p_1">Hon'ble Saurabh Shyam Shamshery,J.
</p> 
<p id="p_2">Order on Delay Condonation Application No. 01 of 2019. 
</p> 
<p id="p_3">Heard learned counsel for parties. 
</p> 
<p id="p_4">Cause shown in the Delay Condonation Application to condone the delay in filing the present appeal is sufficient. Delay is condoned.
</p> 
<p id="p_5">Accordingly, the Delay Condonation Application stands allowed. 
</p> 
<p id="p_6">Office is directed to allot regular number to the Special Appeal. 
</p> 
<p id="p_7">Order on Special Appeal. 
</p> 
<p id="p_8">This Special Appeal under Chapter VIII Rule 5 of the High Court Rules has been filed against the judgment and order dated 31.07.2019 passed by learned Single Judge in Writ - A No. 23309 of 2015 (Jagannath Prasad Vs. Union of India and others) whereby the petition has been allowed reinstating the respondent No. 1 (petitioner) and also granting him the back wages. 
</p> 
<p id="p_9">Heard learned senior counsel Mr. G.K. Singh assisted by Shri Anand Tiwari on behalf of the appellants and learned counsel for the respondent No. 1, Shri Dharmendra Dubey and Shri Akhilesh Kumar as well as Shri Arvind Kumar Goswami appearing for respondent No. 2.
</p> 
<p id="p_10">It is submitted by the learned senior counsel on behalf of the appellants that the learned Single Judge has allowed the writ petition merely on conjecture that the money being taken by the writ petitioner may not essentially be bribe and could be the change of Rs. 50/-. As a matter of fact, the writ petitioner never pleaded a single word in this regard either during the disciplinary proceedings or during the pendency of the writ petition. The order passed by the learned Single Judges deserves to be quashed on this ground alone.
</p> 
<p id="p_11">It has been further submitted by the learned senior counsel that the learned Single Judge has erred in holding that the evidence before the Inquiry Officer was only hear-say. He submits that the evidence of video clip obtained from the CCTV footage cannot be termed as hear-say evidence. Not only this, even the writ petitioner has not denied the receipt of the money from the TT driver and cleaner, therefore, it cannot be said that the charges levelled against the writ petitioner were false and baseless. 
</p> 
<p id="p_12">Further contention by the learned senior counsel is that after the authenticity of the CD having been proved by the forensic lab, learned Single Judge could not record a perverse finding that the CD cannot be said to be an authentic recording. 
</p> 
<p id="p_13">It has also been argued by the learned senior counsel that since the writ petitioner has not denied the receipt of the money from the TT driver and cleaner and was found guilty in the disciplinary proceeding, he cannot claim the back wages after being reinstated in service. Moreover, there is nothing on record to show that the writ petitioner was not gainfully employed during the period his services were dispensed with by the Corporation. Burden to prove it was on the writ petitioner whether he was gainfully employed or not. No plea has been taken by the writ petitioner that he was not gainfully employed. Therefore, he is not entitled for the back wages as claimed by him. 
</p> 
<p id="p_14">On the other hand, the learned counsel appearing for the respondent No. 1 have disputed the contention of the appellants. 
</p> 
<p id="p_15">The matter requires consideration. 
</p> 
<p id="p_16">In view of the facts and circumstances of the case, we stay the effect and operation of the impugned judgment and order dated 31.07.2019 passed by learned Single Judge in Writ - A No. 23309 of 2015 (Jagannath Prasad Vs. Union of India and others) only to the extent of awarding back wages to the writ petitioner (respondent No. 1) during the pendency of this Special Appeal. 
</p> 
<p id="p_17">Six weeks time is granted to the counsel for respondents to file counter affidavit and three weeks time is allowed to the appellants to file rejoinder affidavit, if any. 
</p> 
<p id="p_18">List thereafter. 
</p> 
<p id="p_19">Connect with Special Appeal Defective No. 898 of 2019 (Indian Oil Corporation Ltd. and 4 others Vs. Ashok Kumar Dixit and another). 
</p> 
<p id="p_20">Order Date :- 15.10.2019
