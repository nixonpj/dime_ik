    The High Court Of Madhya Pradesh
                         MCRC-1463-2019
      (VISHAL KOTKAR Vs THE STATE OF MADHYA PRADESH)

Jabalpur, Dated : 23-01-2019
      Mohd. Shafiqullah, learned counsel for the applicant.
      Shri   Neeraj    Asar,   learned    panel   lawyer    for   the
respondent/State.</pre>
<p id="p_1">      Heard. Perused the case diary.
</p><p id="p_2">      This is first bail application filed by the applicant under
<a href="/doc/1290514/" id="a_1">Section 439</a> of the Cr.P.C. for grant of bail in connection with
Crime No.1011/2018 registered at Police Station T.T.Nagar
District Bhopal for the offence punishable under <a href="/doc/986100/" id="a_2">Section 401</a> of
the Indian Penal Code.
</p><p id="p_3">      According to the case of the prosecution, the allegation
against the present applicant is that the applicant along with other
co-accused persons were planning to commit theft. On a tip of an
informant, the police arrested the applicant and other co-accused
persons on 04.12.2018. After the investigation, the charge sheet
has been filed and on the basis of the report, the aforesaid offence
was registered against the present applicant.
</p><p id="p_4">      Learned counsel for the applicant submits that the applicant
is innocent and has been falsely implicated in the case. He is in
custody since 04.12.2018. There is no direct evidence against the
applicant herein. Charge sheet has been filed in this case. There is
no likelihood of applicant absconding and tampering with the
prosecution evidence and his further custody is not required in this
case. It is also contended that the applicant is ready to furnish the
surety and abide all the directions and conditions which may be
imposed by this Court. On the aforesaid grounds, learned counsel
for the applicant has prayed that the applicant be released on bail.

<p id="p_5">                                    Learned Govt. Advocate for the State opposing the
                              submissions made on behalf of the applicant has prayed for
                              rejection of the bail application.
</p><p id="p_6">                                    Looking to the facts and circumstances of the case, but
                              without commenting anything on its merits, this application for
                              grant of bail is allowed. It is ordered that applicant Vishal Kotkar
                              be released on bail on his furnishing a personal bond for the sum
                              of Rs.50,000/- (Rupees Fifty Thousand Only) with one solvent

                              securing his presence before the said Court on all the dates of
                              hearing fixed in this regard during trial and for complying with the
                              conditions enumerated in sub-section (3) of Section 437 of Cr.P.C.
</p><p id="p_7">                                    This order shall remain effective till the end of the trial but
                              in case of bail jump it shall become ineffective.
