IN THE HIGH COURT OF JUDICATURE AT MADRAS
						
Dated: 11.03.2015

Coram:

THE HONOURABLE Ms. JUSTICE K.B.K.VASUKI

S.A.No.705 of 2005
					
Sendhamarai Ayal @ Thamil Selvi				... Appellant
							
						vs.

1.Rekkuraj
2.Dhanaraj
3.Ponnusamy Parameswara Vannia Nayanar		...   Respondents
						
	Second Appeal is filed under Section 100 of the Civil Procedure Code against the judgment and decree dated 23.12.2004 made in AS.No.36 of 2004 on the file of the Sub Court, Chidamabaram, reversing the judgment and decree dated 30.04.2003 made in O.S.No.832 of 1989 on the file of the Principal District Munsif Court, Chidambaram.
		For Appellant      :  Mrs.Vijayakumari Natarajan
		For Respondents :  Mr.S.Krishnasamy

				   J U D G M E N T 
</pre><p id="p_1">	The plaintiff in the suit in O.S.No.832 of 1989, who is the first respondent in AS.No.36 of 2004 is the appellant herein. The plaintiff filed the suit for declaration of her title and delivery of possession of the suit properties with past and future mesne profits. The plaint proceeds as if one Pattusamy @ Muthukumarasamy Vannamudayar and Thangasamy Vannamudayar were brothers and they divided their family properties under partition list. The defendants 1 and 2 are the sons and the third defendant is the son-in-law of Pattusamy @ Muthukumarasamy Vannamudayar.  Thiruneelam and Chinnathurai are the sons of Thangasamy Vannamudayar and Chinnathurai is the father of the plaintiff. After the death of the plaintiff's parents and her paternal uncle Thiruneelam as bachelor, the plaintiff has been looked after by her uncle Govindasamy. The plaintiff has claimed the suit reliefs in respect of schedule mentioned items, some of which were got by her grand father Thangasamy under partition list and the remaining were self acquired by her grand father.  The claim of the plaintiff is based on the Will executed by her grand father in favour of her father Chinnathurai in respect of the suit properties. According to the plaintiff, after the death of her parents, she being their only heir, representing Thangasamy Vannamudayar branch, she became the owner of the properties, which have been in possession and enjoyment of the defendants 1 and 2. When she demanded the same, the defendants have denied the title of the plaintiff and refused to hand over the possession of the suit property.  By pleading so, the suit came to be filed for the suit reliefs stated supra.
</p>
<p id="p_2">	2.The suit reliefs were resisted by the defendants 2 and 3 by filing separate written statements. It is stated in the written statement filed by the second defendant that the partition between Pattusamy Vannamudayar and Thangasamy Vannamudayar became final long ago and the suit properties were not properties of the plaintiff's grand father and the Will did not include all the suit properties, as such, the plaintiff has no right or title to any of the suit items. It is the further case of the second defendant that the defendants 1 and 2 are the absolute owners of the suit items 1 to 3 through their father Pattusamy Vannamudayar and the third defendant has purchased the suit item 2 from them for valuable consideration and they have no connection with suits items 4,5, 6 and 7 and suit items 8 and 9 are natham properties and have been in possession and enjoyment of the defendants 1 and 2. The third defendant in his written statement stated that he has been in possession and enjoyment of the suit item No.2 purchased by him, since the date of purchase and has perfected title by adverse possession and the suit is bad for non-joinder of necessary parties. 
</p>
<p id="p_3">	3.The parties in support of their respective claims examined the plaintiff and the defendants 2 and 3 as PW1 and DW1 and DW2 and produced Exs.A1 and A2 and Exs.B1 to B18 documents. The trial court on the basis of the oral and documentary evidence adduced before the same, arrived at a conclusion that the plaintiff has established that items 1 and 3 to 9 belonged to her father and after his death, the plaintiff become entitled to succeed to the same and the defendants failed to prove their claim in respect of items 1 and 3 and disowned their claim in respect of items 4, 5, 6 and 7 and failed to prove their possession in respect of items 8 and 9 natham land and the third defendant has established his right title and interest and possession of suit item No.2 and accordingly decreed the suit in favour of the plaintiff in respect of items 1 and 3 to 9, except item No.2.  Aggrieved against the same, the second defendant filed AS.No.36 of 2004.  The claim made before the appellate court is that the suit items 1 and 3 exclusively belong to the second defendant and an extent of 40cents in suit item No.3 having been purchased by the second defendant's father under Ex.A16 from the plaintiff's father, the same belonged to the second defendant's father and thereafter to the second defendant. It is his further case that Thangasamy Vannamudayar and the second defendant's father exchanged suit item No.1 and the available extent in suit item No.3 and the second defendant has prescriptive title by adverse possession in respect of items 1 and 3 and suit item No.4 was already sold and suit items 5 to 7 were not in possession of their ancestors and are not covered under Ex.A2 partition deed and the plaintiff has no right over the same and the suit items 4 to 7 are not all in possession and enjoyment of either of the defendants and the suit items 8 and 9 natham lands are also not covered under Exs.A1 and A2.  The lower appellate court arrived at the conclusion that the plaintiff failed to prove the particulars of the properties, such as, survey number, extent and patta in possession and enjoyment of Thangasamy Vannamudayar, thereby failed to prove identification of the properties allotted to Thangasamy Vannamudayar and the possession and enjoyment of Chinnadurai and failed to prove that the suit properties belong to her father and thereafter to the plaintiff and the suit items 1 to 4 and 8 and 9 are not proved to be belonging to or possessed by either Thangasamy Vannamudayar or Chinnadurai.  Insofar as items 5 to  7 are concerned, the finding of the lower appellate court is that the description of the properties in Ex.A1 does not tally with the description of properties in the suit.  The lower appellate court is of the view that mere admission on the part of the defendants in respect of items 4 to 7 will not automatically go to prove the plaintiff's right to the same. The plaintiff's claim regarding possession of other items by the defendants is also negatived.  The lower appellate court thus having found that the plaintiff failed to prove right, title and interest of Thangasamy Vannamudayar or Chinnadurai in respect of suit items 1 and 3 to 9, allowed the appeal and dismissed the suit.  Hence this second appeal by the plaintiff before this Court.
</p>
<p id="p_4">	4.This second appeal is admitted on the following substantial questions of law:
</p><p id="p_5">	(i)When the title of the plaintiff regarding items 4 to 7 is not disputed by the defendants, whether the lower appellate court is right in dismissing the suit in its entirety?
</p><p id="p_6">	(ii)When the defendants have not established title and when the possession by the defendants could be only by virtue of their fiduciary capacity, whether the lower appellate court is right in holding that recovery of possession cannot be granted?
</p>
<p id="p_7">	(iii)Whether the lower appellate court is right in not giving due weightage to Ex.A2 document of 1930 ignoring <a href="/doc/1507394/" id="a_1">section 90</a> of the Evidence Act?
</p>
<p id="p_8">	5.Heard the rival submissions made on both sides and perused the records.
</p><p id="p_9">	6.As stated above, the plaintiff and the defendants are admittedly closely related to each other. While the defendants 1 and 2 are the sons of Pattusamy @ Muthukumarasamy Vannamudayar, the plaintiff is the grand daughter of his brother Thangasamy Vannamudayar through one of his sons by name Chinnadurai and the other son of Thangasamy Vannamudayar is Thiruneelam. The family property was divided among the brothers Pattusamy @ Muthukumarasamy Vannamudayar and Thangasamy Vannamudayar vide Ex.A2 partition deed dated 23.4.1930 and the property shown as 'A' schedule in Ex.A2 was allotted to Thangasamy Vannamudayar and 'B' schedule was allotted to Pattusamy @ Muthukumarasamy and 'C' Schedule was given to their only sister. It is not in dispute that Thangasamy Vannamudayar, while was alive, executed Ex.A1 registered Will dated 4.10.1958 in respect of the property, which was allotted to him under partition deed and acquired by him independently  in favour of Chinnadurai and after the death of Chinnadurai, the property covered under Will has been inherited by the plaintiff. While the suit items 1, 3 and 4 are covered under the partition deed, items 5 to 7 are covered under Ex.A1 Will. 
</p><p id="p_10">	7.As far as suit item 2 is concerned, the same was not covered either under partition deed or under will and the same was sold by the defendants 1 and 2 in favour of the third defendant vide  Ex.B1 dated 3.7.1980 and thereafter the third defendant has been in possession and enjoyment of the same by exercising absolute ownership over the same. It is also not in dispute that the suit items 8 and 9 are neither covered under partition deed nor under will and they are natham poramboke lands. That being so, the plaintiff, having traced her title through her grand father Thangasamy Vannamudayar and her father Chinnadurai, under undisputed Ex.A2 partition deed and Ex.A1 registered Will in respect of items 1 to 9 and the suit items 2, 8 and 9 having not been covered either under partition deed or registered Will, the plaintiff is disentitled to get the suit relief for declaration of title and recovery of possession in respect of suit items 2, 8 and 9 and the judgment and decree of the lower appellate court to that extent need not be interfered with.
</p>
<p id="p_11">	8.As far as suit item 3 is concerned, the same is in respect of 77 cents out of 1.54 acres in R.S.No.72/1. Under Ex.A2 partition deed, Thangasamy Vannamudayar was allotted 77 cents out of total 1.54cents on northern side, whereas Pattusamy @ Muthukumarasamy Vannamudayar was allotted remaining 77 cents on southern side.  The factum of such allotment under Ex.A2 is also admitted by the second defendant as DW2 in the witness box.  Chinnadurai who is the son of Thangasamy and father of the plaintiff sold an extent of 40 cents out of 77 cents on northern side under Ex.B16 sale deed dated 26.5.1961 within the four boundaries mentioned therein to the second defendant herein. As such, the plaintiff is entitled to only remaining 37 cents.  As the contesting second defendant both in the written statement as well as in his oral statement as DW2 has claimed only 77cents allotted to their father and 40cents sold to him under Ex.B16 sale deed totally 1.17acres in S.No.72/1 i.e, suit item No.3 and as they do not claim any title or possession in respect of remaining extent, the plaintiff is here again entitled to get the declaratory relief only in respect of remaining 37 cents in respect of suit item 3. 
</p>
<p id="p_12">	9.Insofar as the remaining items 1 and 4 to 7 are concerned, the contesting defendants in the written statement and in the witness box categorically stated that they have no connection with suit items  4 to 7. The second defendant as DW2 has in the course of his cross examination admitted that except 40cents in suit item No.3, they have no right over the remaining suit items.  That means, the claim made by the second defendant in respect of item No.1 in the written statement is also given up in the witness box.  As such, the plaintiff on the basis of documents produced herein and on the basis of the admission made on the side of the defendants, disowning any title in respect of items 1 and 4 to 7, is entitled to declaratory relief in respect of the same.
</p><p id="p_13">	10.Thus, the discussions held above would reveal that the plaintiff  through her grand father and her father, is entitled to the suit items 1 and 4 to 7 and is also entitled to remaining 37 cents, out of 77 cents on northern side, excluding 40 cents covered under Ex.B16 in suit item 3. Though the plaintiff's title in respect of the items stated above is clearly admitted by the defendants in the written statement and in the witness box, the lower appellate court wrongly negatived the declaratory relief in respect of the suit items above referred to above. The judgment and decree of the lower appellate court to that extent regarding declaratory relief warrants interference by this court.  However, the plaintiff, having come to court for declaring her title and for recovery of possession of the suit items from the contesting defendants saying that those properties have been in possession and enjoyment of the defendants, failed to establish her case regarding the possession and enjoyment of the same by the contesting defendants.  The contesting defendants have clearly stated that they have been in possession and enjoyment of the suit items 1 and 3 inherited from their father. Likewise, the third defendant claims to be in possession of suit item No.2 purchased by him from the defendants 1 and 2.  The plaintiff except producing Exs.A1 and A2 documents is not aware of the actual state of affairs on land and her evidence in the witness box is of no help to her to prove the defendant's possession and enjoyment of the suit properties.  She has also not examined anyone who is aware of the actual state of affairs.  On her failure to do so, the lower appellate Court rightly rejected the suit relief for recovery of possession and this court finds no reason to disagree with the same.  Accordingly the substantial questions of law No.1 is answered in favour of the plaintiff and the other substantial questions of law Nos.2 and 3 are answered against her.
</p>
<p id="p_14">	11.In the result, the judgment and decree of the lower appellate court made in AS.No.36 of 2004 is set aside insofar as it relates to declaratory relief in respect of suit items 1 and 37cents on northern side in item No.3 and items 4 to 7 and the same is confirmed in respect of the suit items 2 and 40cents on southern side in suit items 3 and 8 and 9 and in respect of relief of recovery of possession regarding all the suit items.  Consequently, the suit is partly decreed for declaratory relief in respect of item No.1 and 37cents on northern side in suit item No.3 and suit items 4 to 7 and the suit is partly dismissed for declaratory relief in respect of suit items 2 and 40 cents on southern side in item No.3 and items 8 and 9 and in respect of recovery of possession of all suit items.
</p>
<p id="p_15">	12.The Second Appeal is  accordingly disposed of.   No costs.
