Police Station Vigilance Bureau, District Ludhiana is being sought, on the basis of

compromise/settlement dated 29.04.2011 (P-3).
</p>
<p id="p_2">               The petitioner was a director of M/s Harshill Wires Pvt. Ltd. In the

year 2000, the petitioner approached respondent No. 2-PFC for taking loan for

setting up a factory of wire drawing against the property of the company.

Accordingly, the property of the company was mortgaged and first installment `

26,59,500/- was issued. However, the petitioner was unable to pay back the loan

to respondent No. 2 which resulted in multiplication of the liability towards

respondent No. 2. The loan amount arises to ` 55,00,000/- as on 29.04.2011. In

the above background, F.I.R was registered against the petitioner and performa

respondent Nos. 4 and 5 (P-1).
</p>
<p id="p_4">               In the year 2009, respondent No. 2 floated a One time Settlement

Scheme (for short 'OTS scheme') for settling the unpaid loans taken by any or all

the entities all over Punjab. The petitioner thereafter approached respondent N. 2

for settlement of his account and paid an amount of ` 9,78,000/- under the OTS

Scheme. The cheque drawn in favour of respondent No. 2 dated 14.02.2011 is

Annexure P-2. Thereafter, a settlement plan was worked out and under the OTS

Scheme, the petitioner would have to pay ` 65,00,000/- as full and final

settlement against the loan taken by the petitioner. Copy of the settlement is

Annexure P-3. In pursuance of the settlement between the petitioner and

respondent No. 2, the petitioner has made a further payment of ` 10,78,066/-

(P-4).
</p>
<p id="p_5">               On notice, a reply has been filed by respondent No. 2 on 06.12.2011.

They have stated that the company deposited ` 9.78 lacs towards settlement

under the OTS Scheme on 15.12.2011 and respondent No. 2 has approved

settlement in the settlement committee held on 20.04.2011 at an amount of `

51,08,256/- with further interest from 20.04.2011 in loan account-I and `

17,45,297/- with further interest from 20.04.2011 in loan account-II plus further

expenses. It was admitted that the petitioner has paid ` 10,78,066/- towards the

part payment under the OTS Scheme. As per the records of the Corporation, the

entire amount has been settled, as per the decision of the settlement committee

held on 20.04.2011 and stands paid.
</p>
<p id="p_7">               After going through the reply filed by respondent No. 2, it seems

that the claim has been settled under the OTS Scheme and now nothing survives

for continuation of proceedings against the petitioner. As per law laid down by

State of Haryana and others versus Bhajan Lal and others 1992 Supp (1)

Supreme Court Cases 335 and <a href="/doc/1327342/" id="a_3">S. Khushboo v. Kanniammal &amp; Another</a>,

2010 (2) R.C.R. (Criminal) 793. The law relating to quashing of

criminal proceedings is summed up as follows:-

<blockquote id="blockquote_2">         (1)Where the allegations made in the First Information Report

         or the complaint, even if they are taken at their face value and

         accepted in their entirety do not prima facie constitute any

         offence or make out a case against the accused.

         (2)In a case where there is sufficient evidence against the

         accused, which may establish the charge against him/her, the

         proceedings cannot be quashed.

<blockquote id="blockquote_3">         (3)Where a criminal proceeding is manifestly attended with

         mala fide and/or where the proceeding is maliciously

         personal grudge.

<blockquote id="blockquote_4">         (4)Criminal proceedings can be quashed but such a power is

</p><p id="p_9">         (5)High Court while exercising its inherent jurisdiction should

         not interfere with a genuine complaint but it should certainly

         not hesitate to intervene in appropriate cases. In fact it was
