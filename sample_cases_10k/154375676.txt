      the Management and perused the records. My findings on the issues are
      as under:­
</p><p id="p_20">12.          ISSUE No. 1­ Whether the claimant was engaged by the
      management for a specific period and purpose and therefore
      covered under S.2(oo) (bb) <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_2">I.D. Act</a> ? OPM

             Since the case turns on the interpretation of <a href="/doc/1418464/" id="a_3">Section 2(oo)(bb)</a> of
      the ID Act, it will be convenient to quote the said section before
      proceeding to consider merits of the case:
</p>

<p id="p_21">      "2. In this Act, unless there is anything repugnant in the subject or
      context­


      (oo) "retrenchment" means the termination by the employer of the
      service of a workman for any reason whatsoever, otherwise than as a
      punishment inflicted by way of disciplinary action, but does not
      include--
</p>

<p id="p_22">      (a) voluntary retirement of the workman; or


       DID No.1937/2016, Sh. Rajender Vs. Delhi Jal Board etc.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                 11</span>

</p><p id="p_23">(b) retirement of the workman on reaching the age of superannuation if
the contract of employment between the employer and the workman
concerned contains a stipulation in that behalf; or


(bb) termination of the service of the workman as a result of the non­
renewal of the contract of employment between the employer and the
workman concerned on this expiry or of such contract being
terminated under a stipulation in that behalf contained therein; or


</p><p id="p_24">(c) termination of the service of a workman on the ground of continued
ill health."
</p>

<p id="p_25">        On a plain reading of the statutory provision, it is clear that any
termination of service of a workman by the employer for any reason
whatsoever comes within the meaning of the expression 'retrenchment'
as defined in <a href="/doc/1418464/" id="a_4">Section 2(oo)</a> of the Act. The section, however, provides
certain exceptions to the wide and comprehensive definition of the term
'retrenchment'. The exceptions are:
</p>

<p id="p_26">(1) Termination of appointment inflicted by way of disciplinary action


(2) Voluntary retirement of the workman


(3) retirement of the workman on reaching the age of superannuation if
the contract of employment between the employer and the workman
concerned contains a stipulation in that behalf; or


(4) termination of the service of the workman as a result of the non­

  DID No.1937/2016, Sh. Rajender Vs. Delhi Jal Board etc.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                                 12</span>

renewal of the contract of employment between the employment and the
workman concerned on its expiry or of such contract being terminated
under a stipulation in that behalf contained therein, or


(5) termination of the service of a workman on the ground of continued
ill health.
</p>

<p id="p_27">         It follows therefore that if the case of termination of the
workman comes within any of the exceptions enumerated in the section
then the said termination will not be a case of 'retrenchment' within the
meaning of <a href="/doc/1418464/" id="a_5">Section 2(oo)</a>. It has been held in <a href="/doc/999910/" id="a_6">Mukhtyar Singh vs Food
Corporation Of India And Ors</a>. {reported in 1992 (1994) IILLJ 488
MP ; 1992 (0) MPLJ 902}:
</p>

<p id="p_28">         "The first part speaks of a contract which is of renewable
character while the second part speaks of contract of any character.
Our conclusion is that if the service of a workman is allowed to get
terminated by non­renewal of the contract of service with him, it falls
within the first part of (bb), and if the service of a workman is
terminated acting under a stipulation in that behalf contained in the
contract, it falls within the second part of (bb) and both cases falling
within the "excepted category" are not retrenchment. The decision in
C.M. Jitendra v. Management, B.E. Movies reported in 1985 LIC
1833, cited by the learned counsel for the respondent supports our
view."

       <a href="/doc/1651327/" id="a_8">In Municipal Council v. Raju</a>, 2006 SCC 473, respondent was
appointed as a typist on contract basis at Octroi Branch where
permanent employees had gone on leave. The respondent gave an
affidavit that his services may be dispensed with by the Municipal
Council at any time. The respondent worked from 24.6.1994 to
2.3.1996 and 7.3.1997 to 21.5.1997 with the Corporation and thereafter
his services were dispensed with. The question arose whether <a href="/doc/1418464/" id="a_9">Section
2(oo)(bb)</a> of the Industrial Disputes Act was applicable or not. Supreme
Court observed that <a href="/doc/1418464/" id="a_10">Section 2(oo)(bb)</a> of ID Act was applicable even in
such cases where the employment is taken by a person for a short
limited period knowing fully well that he is liable to be terminated at

appointed for a fixed period and for a particular scheme. After the
scheme came to an end, the services of the workman were terminated. It
was observed that even assuming that the respondent had worked 240
days continuously, he cannot claim that his services should be
continued because the number of 240 days does not apply to the
respondent inasmuch as his services were purely contractual. The
termination of his contract does not amount to retrenchment and,
therefore, it does not attract compliance of <a href="/doc/1056316/" id="a_12">Section 25F</a> of ID Act at all.

</p>

<p id="p_49">       "................It is not as if the person who accepts an
engagement either temporary or casual in nature, is not aware of the
nature of his employment. He accepts the employment with open eyes.
It may be true that he is not in a position to bargain­not at arm's
length­since he might have been searching for some employment so
as to eke out his livelihood and accepts whatever he gets. But on that
ground alone, it would not be appropriate to jettison the constitutional
scheme of appointment and to take the view that a person who has
temporarily or casually got employed should be directed to be
continued permanently. By doing so, it will be creating another mode
of public appointment which is not permissible. If the court were to
void a contractual employment of this nature on the ground that the
parties were not having equal bargaining power, that too would not
enable the court to grant any relief to that employee. A total embargo
on such casual or temporary employment is not possible, given the
exigencies of administration and if imposed, would only mean that
some people who at least get employment temporarily, contractually
or casually, would not be getting even that employment when
securing of such employment brings at least some succour to them.
After all, innumerable citizens of our vast country are in search of
employment and one is not compelled to accept a casual or temporary
employment if one is not inclined to go in for such an employment. It

   employment was accepted fully knowing the nature of it and the
   consequences flowing from it. " (para 45)

   workman­herein was contractual employee of the management whose
