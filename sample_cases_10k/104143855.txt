                                                             M.Cr.C.No.7244/2010

</pre>
<p id="p_1">        This MCrC for cancellation of bail has been registered in
pursuance of order-dated 13/7/10 passed in MCrC No.1715/10,
rejecting bail application moved on behalf of co-accused Sonu alias
Ashish. By that order only, direction was given to issue notice to
Vijay Kesharwani to show cause as to why the bail granted to him,
by Sessions Judge, Mandla as In-charge Special Judge (under the
Narcotic Drugs and <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_1">Psychotropic Substances Act</a> 1985) [for short
'the Act'] vide order-dated 27/6/09 by extending advantage of the
proviso appended to sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/1687975/" id="a_2">Section 167</a> of the Code of
Criminal Procedure (hereinafter referred to as 'the proviso'), should
not be cancelled.
</p>
<p id="p_2">2.      In reply, the noticee has submitted that the bail does not
deserve to be cancelled for the following reasons -
</p>
<p id="p_3">        (i)     Benefit of the proviso was rightly extended to him.
</p><p id="p_4">        (ii)    There is no allegation as to misuse of the privilege.
</p>
<p id="p_5">3.      Facts leading to issuance of the notice may be summarized as
under -

<blockquote id="blockquote_1">                After being arrested in connection with Crime
        No.34/09 registered at P.S. Karanjiya, District Dindori, in

      the Act, the noticee was produced before the Magistrate
      having jurisdiction on 26/4/09. Taking note of the fact that
      charge sheet was not presented before expiry of 60 days
      from the date of the order authorizing his detention in
      judicial custody, learned Judge, vide order-dated 27/6/09,
      proceeded to release the noticee on compulsive bail under
      the proviso. While doing so, he also placed reliance on the
      following bail orders passed by the co-ordinate Benches of
      this Court in -

</blockquote><p id="p_6">4.    Allegations against the noticee, in substance, are that he was
found conjointly involved in transporting Ganja in a Maruti Van
bearing registration No.MP-20-HA-3816. As per the relevant
account, -
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_6">              in the night intervening 25th and 26th of April 2009 at
      about 1 p.m., upon a credible information that as many as
      3 persons were carrying Ganja in the Maruti Van, T.K.
      Soni, the SHO of P.S. Karanjiya, intercepted the vehicle at
      Bazar Tola Main Road. However, co-accused Guddu, who
      was sitting in the front seat by the side of the driver, was
      able to flee away but the noticee, who was driving the
      vehicle and co-accused Sonu alias Ashish, who was sitting
      on the rear seat of the vehicle, were apprehended. A total
      quantity of 32.770 Kgs. of Ganja in the form of 7 Sillis
      (compact blocks) were recovered from the Van. Out of
      these, 2 Sillis weighing 10.570 Kgs. were found under the
      driver's seat whereas the other 5 were recovered from
                                  :: 3
                                                 M.Cr.C. No.7244/2010




      beneath the seat whereon co-accused Sonu was sitting.
      Accordingly, the detecting officer prepared two seizure
      panchnamas suggesting that quantity of 10.570 Kgs of
      Ganja was found in the possession of noticee whereas
      possession of the remaining quantity of the contraband
      was attributable to the co-accused Sonu.
</blockquote>

<p id="p_7">5.    Observing that the order granting bail did not contain any
discussion on the point as to whether the case related to persons
accused of an offence involving commercial quantity within the
meaning of sub-section (4) of <a href="/doc/1712009/" id="a_7">section 36A</a> of the Act, this Court
initiated this proceeding for cancellation of bail. The sub-section
reads -
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_7">             "In respect of persons accused of an offence
      punishable under <a href="/doc/128102/" id="a_8">section 19</a> or <a href="/doc/1373137/" id="a_9">section 24</a> or <a href="/doc/935721/" id="a_10">section
      27A</a> or for offences involving commercial quantity
      the references in sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/1687975/" id="a_11">section 167</a> of the
      Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974) thereof to
      "ninety days", where they occur, shall be construed as
      reference to "one hundred and eighty days": Provided
      that, if it is not possible to complete the investigation
      within the said period of one hundred and eighty days,
      the Special Court may extend the said period up to one
      year on the report of the Public Prosecutor indicating
      the progress of the investigation and the specific
      reasons for the detention of the accused beyond the
      said period of one hundred and eighty days"
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_8">                                                 [Emphasis supplied]


</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_9">6.    Learned Senior Counsel, making reference to the decisions of
the Apex Court in <a href="/doc/367804/" id="a_12">Devilal v. State of Rajasthan</a> AIR 1971 SC 1444
and <a href="/doc/807023/" id="a_13">Lakshmi Singh v. State of Bihar</a> AIR 1976 SC 2263, has
strenuously contended that it is not open for the Court or to the
prosecution to make a new case pertaining to commercial quantity
as against the noticee so as to imperil the defence. According to
him, it is not possible to presume that as driver, the noticee was in
                                   :: 4
                                                  M.Cr.C. No.7244/2010




conscious possession of the entire quantity of the contraband found
in the vehicle. To buttress the contention, following precedents have
been cited -
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_10">      (i)      <a href="/doc/279500/" id="a_14">Avtar Singh v. State of Punjab</a> AIR 2002 SC 3343
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_11">      (ii)     <a href="/doc/1117082/" id="a_15">State of Punjab v. Balkar Singh</a> (2004) 3 SCC 582


</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_12">7.    However, scope of this proceeding lies in a narrow compass
as the point for consideration is that whether, for the purpose of bail
under the proviso, it can be presumed that the noticee was in
conscious possession of the entire quantity of the contraband
recovered from the vehicle driven by him ? In this view of the matter,
the apprehension that substratum of the prosecution case would
undergo a change is apparently misconceived.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_8">8.    In Balkar Singh's case (supra), the accused persons who
belonged to different villages were found sitting on the bags of
poppy husk while, as per the prosecution version in Avtar Singh's
case (above), amongst the five inmates of the truck, the one sitting
by the side of the driver and the other sitting on the back side of the
Truck, were able to run away whereas the driver of the Truck and
other two accused sitting on the bags kept in the back side of the
truck were apprehended. However, facts of the instant case are
apparently distinguishable as the corresponding investigation has
revealed that the noticee as well as co-accused Sonu had gone in
the same vehicle from Jabalpur to a place near Guriella,
Chhattisgarh picking up Guddu on the way from Phoolsagar, District
Mandla and the black bag containing 2 Sillis and the gunny bag
comprising 7 Sillis of Ganja were loaded there in the vehicle at the
instance of Guddu for transportation to Jabalpur. Thus, all the three
inmates of the vehicle were known to each other and further it was
not a Public Transport Vehicle. This apart, the quantity of the
contraband as mentioned in the respective seizure memo was also
                                   :: 5
                                                  M.Cr.C. No.7244/2010




in the same form. Under these circumstances, presumption of
conscious possession under <a href="/doc/1297682/" id="a_16">Section 54</a> of the Act was available
against each one of the accused. For this, reference may be made
to a recent decision of the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/371761/" id="a_17">Dehal Singh v. State
of H.P</a>. 2010 AIR SCW 5533. As such, benefit of <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_18">Section 167(2)</a>
could be extended to the noticee only in the event of non-filing of the
charge sheet within a period of 180 days simply because it was a
case relating to commercial quantity of the contraband. Learned
Judge, therefore, completely misdirected himself in extending the
benefit of the proviso to the noticee on the ground that the
investigation was not completed within a period of 60 days.
</p>
<p id="p_9">9.    Needless to say that a bail order cannot be cited as a
precedent as it does not contain any discussion as to the point in
issue. Moreover, the assertion that the noticee has not misused the
liberty granted to him is also of no consequence as the concept of
setting aside the unjustified illegal or perverse order is totally
different from the concept of canceling the bail on the ground that
the noticee has misconducted himself or because of some new facts
requiring such cancellation. Accordingly, one of the grounds for
cancellation of bail would be where ignoring material and evidence
on record a perverse order granting bail is passed in a serious crime
of this nature involving commercial quantity of contraband. Such an
order would be against principles of law. Interests of justice would
also require that such a perverse order be set aside and bail be
cancelled (<a href="/doc/120934883/" id="a_19">Puran v. Rambilas</a> (2001) 6 SCC 338 referred to).
</p>

<p id="p_10">10.   On a conspectus of the factual scenario and the relevant
provision of law, the order granting compulsive bail deserves to be
set aside.
</p><p id="p_11">                                   :: 6
                                                   M.Cr.C. No.7244/2010




</p><p id="p_12">11.   Consequently, the order-dated 27/6/09 (supra) is hereby
cancelled.
</p>
<p id="p_13">12.   Noticee Vijay Kesharwani is directed to surrender before the
Special Court at Dindori on or before 8/11/10 and in case of failure,
the Special Judge shall issue warrant of arrest against him. It is,
however, made clear that nothing contained in this order shall affect
the right of the noticee to move the Special Court for grant of bail
after his surrender in the light of subsequent events.
