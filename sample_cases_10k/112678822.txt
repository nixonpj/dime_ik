HIGH COURT OF JUDICATURE AT ALLAHABAD
 
 

?Court No. - 80
 

 
Case :- CRIMINAL MISC. BAIL APPLICATION No. - 38776 of 2018
 

 
Applicant :- Shivji Yadav
 
Opposite Party :- State Of U.P.
 
Counsel for Applicant :- Nazrul Islam Jafri
 
Counsel for Opposite Party :- G.A.
 

 
Hon'ble Ajit Singh,J.
</pre> 
<p id="p_1">Heard Sri N.I. Jafri, learned Senior Advocate, assisted by Sri Mohd. Shahanshah Alam Ansari, counsel for the appellant, learned A.G.A. for the State and perused the material on record.
</p> 
<p id="p_2">The first information report of the incident was lodged by the informant against eleven persons including applicant, alleging therein that 28.1.2017 at about 4:00 p.m. when his father Ram Darash Yadav was returning his home and when he reached near the house of Hadish, the present accused along with other co-accused Upendra Yadav, Loha Yadav, Udai Pratap Yadav, Baban Yadav, Ranjeet Yadav, Rajan Yadav, Vipin Yadav, Surendra Yadav, Dinanath Yadav and Harishankar Yadav armed with lathi, pharsa and country made pistol surrounded him and after hurling abuses had fired at him and assaulted him with pharsa, causing injuries to him. After hearing the noise mother Indu and and sister Rinkoo of the informant rushed to the spot to save the victim. The accused persons also assaulted the mother and the sister of the informant with fire arm and pharsa, causing injuries to them as a result, the mother and the father of the informant have succumbed to their injuries on the spot and her sister is under treatment.  
</p> 
<p id="p_3">Learned counsel for the appellants submitted that although in the first information report it was alleged that eleven persons (the appellants) had assaulted the deceased with firearm and pharsa, however, as per postmortem report of the deceased Ram Daraksh Yadav and Indu have died due to antemortem firearm injury. He next submitted that the applicant is absolutely innocent and has been falsely implicated in the present case due to some ulterior motive. He further submitted that the injured Rinkoo in her statement has attributed the role of firing to co-accused Loha Yadav and Babban and the only role which has been assigned to the applicant is that he has also fired, as a result Rinkoo also sustained injury on her vest. The injury sustained by the injured was on non-vital part of the body and is not dangerous to life. The criminal history of the applicant has been properly explained in para 22 of the affidavit accompanying the bail application. He lastly submitted that the applicant, who is in jail since 22.12.2017, is entitled to be enlarged on bail during pendency of the trial.
</p> 
<p id="p_4">Per contra, learned A.G.A. has opposed the prayer for bail and submitted that the postmortem report of the deceased Ram Darash Yadav shows that two wounds of entry and two wounds of exit and the deceased Indu received one wound of entry and one wound of exit and the injured Rinkoo also sustained. She in her statement has categorically stated that more shots might have been fired by those people, who were having firearms in their hands. He next submitted that the applicant has shot fired without any provocation and hence considering his role he is not entitled to be enlarged on bail.
</p> 
<p id="p_5">After having heard the submissions advanced by learned counsel for the parties and perused the material brought on record. I am not inclined to enlarge the applicant on bail at this stage of trial, hence the bail applicant is accordingly rejected.
</p> 
<p id="p_6">Order Date :- 25.9.2019
