                     R/CR.MA/15157/2017                                                    ORDER




         was alleged that the applicant-accused no.1 was harassing the
         girls and the deceased Shambhubhai and witness Shailendra
         reprimanded them for not doing so and as a result thereof, the
         appellant entered into conspiracy with an intention to kill
         Shambhubhai and witness Shailendra and the appellant called
         deceased Shambhubhai nearby at mobile tower of Dhimasar
         village.      That witness Shailendra, who was on duty in the
         company refused to reach there in time and accused nos.1, 2
         and 3 together had given knife blows to the deceased
         Shambhubhai on different parts of the body, who succumbed
         to the injuries later on.
</p>

<p id="p_4">               It is submitted that the case of the prosecution is based
         on circumstantial evidence, which includes last seen together
         with the accused by the witness viz. PW No.13 and to a great
         extent it is supported by Shailesh, PW No.16, who was also
         called to reach mobile tower of Dhimasar village. In addition
         to above, the prosecution case was believed by the learned
         trial judge based on Serological Report inasmuch as blood
         group of the deceased was 'O' group and accused had blood
         group of 'AB'. The bloodstains on clothes of the deceased, the
         bloodstains found on the muddamal article knife as well as
         bloodstains found on the clothes of accused, were found to be
         of Group 'O'.            It is submitted that all the circumstances
         believed by the learned trial judge are not established and
         having       no     nexus       or   a      link     with       other       circumstances
         establishing         guilt      of   the     accused          and       also      ruling       out
         involvement of accused. The case of the prosecution is also
         about in all five accused and two accused are found to be
         absconding as per the charge sheet filed in the court.</p><pre id="pre_2">

                  R/CR.MA/15157/2017                                               ORDER




</pre><p id="p_5">               It is accordingly submitted that the evidence as above
         may kindly be considered and that the period of imprisonment
         so far is about 8 years as the applicant was not bailed out
         during the trial and the present appeal, which is filed in the
         year 2017 is not likely to be heard in the near future and the
         applicant may be enlarged on bail by suspending the
         sentence.
</p>

<p id="p_6">         4     Ms.Maithili Mehta, learned APP appearing for the
         respondent-State has opposed the bail on the ground that the
         case of prosecution though based on circumstantial evidence
         is   believed     by     the   learned        trial   judge        and       not      only
         circumstances were established, but even forming a chain
         were also considered in light of the settled principles of law
         by the Apex Court to which reference was made by the
         learned trial Judge in paragraph 13 of the judgment, which
         includes the conduct of the accused before commission of the
         crime when he along with other accused were reprimanded by
         the deceased and PW No.16 - Shaileshbhai and on third day of
         such admonishing murder of Shambhubhai had taken place.
         The post mortem report and the timings etc. of the death of
         Shambhubhai supports the theory of last seen together so
         deposed by PW No.13 and the presence of the motorcycle of
         the deceased at the scene of offence and other bloodstains
         coupled with blood group of 'O' group belonging to the
         deceased were found on the clothes of the present applicant
         and, therefore, at this stage the application and prayer made
         therein deserve to be rejected.

         panchas of recovery of knife and also of clothes of the
         accused, we find that the accused-applicant, we find that
         accused-applicant was in jail for about 8 years and the appeal
         may not be heard in the near future, a case is made out to
