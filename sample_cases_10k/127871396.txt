</p><p id="p_2">   1. Briefly stated the case of the prosecution is that on 26.02.2006, at
      about 2:10 p.m, at Dal Mill Road, Near Export Factory, Uttam Nagar,

      12 bottles of illicit liquor, without any permit or license and thereby
      committed an offence punishable u/s 61 of the Punjab Excise Act,
      1914. Charge sheet was filed accordingly.
</p>

<p id="p_3">   2. Charge u/s 61 of the Punjab Excise Act, 1914 was framed against the
      accused on dated 18.02.2008 to which she pleaded not guilty and
      claimed to be tried.
</p>

<p id="p_4">   3. Prosecution in support of its case examined four witnesses.

      basis of which he had registered the present FIR. He duly proved the
      same as Ex. PW1/A.
</p>

<p id="p_6">   5. PW-2 HC Rajnish Kumar, deposed that on 26.02.2006, he was posted
      as Ct. at PS Uttam Nagar. On that day he was on area patrolling duty.
      During duty at about 2:10 pm, he reached near Dal Mill Road, Export
      Factory, Uttam Nagar, He saw accused Saroj, present in the court that
      day and correctly identified by him, coming from the side of Dal Mill
      Road and she was having white color plastic cane in her right hand.
      After seeing him, she turned to other side so on suspicion he stopped


FIR NO. 144/06                 State Vs. Saroj               (Page 2 of 11)
      her and he inquired from her about the plastic cane but she did not tell
     any thing regarding same, so he made her to lay down the cane and
     open the lid of the cane and found the same to smelling liquor. He
     informed the same to DO at PS. Thereafter, HC Rohtas Singh had
     come on the spot.      Thereafter, he handed over recovered cane
     containing liquor and accused to HC Rohtas Singh and told him about
     the incident. He recorded his statement Ex. PW2/A bearing his
     signatures at point-A. He requested 3-4 passerby to join the
     investigation but none agreed and left the spot after giving their
     genuine excuses and without disclosing their identity. Thereafter, IO
     asked him to bring a bucket, a mug and a bottle of 750 ml. from
     nearby kabari shop. He brought the same and handed over the same
     to HC Rohtas. Thereafter, the liquor in the cane was measured and
     found to be 12 bottles of 750 ml. One bottle was separated as a
     sample and rest of the liquor was poured back in the cane and both
     were sealed with the seal of RS. Form M-29 was also filled and
     thereafter seal after use was handed over to him by HC Rohtas. The
     above said was seized vide seizure memo Ex. PW2/B bearing his
     signatures at point-A. Thereafter, HC Rohtas prepared a tehrir and
     handed over the same to him and he came to PS for registration of the
     case. He got the FIR registered and returned back to the spot after
     registration of FIR and handed over the copy of FIR along with original
     tehrir to HC Rohtas. He prepared the site plan. He inquired from the
     accused and arrested the accused vide memo Ex. PW2/C bearing his
     signatures at point-A. Thereafter, she was released on bail at the
     spot. HC Rohtas recorded his supplementary statement. Thereafter,
     he along with HC Rohtas came to PS and case property was
     deposited in the Malkhana.

<p id="p_7">FIR NO. 144/06                State Vs. Saroj                (Page 3 of 11)
             On 10.03.2006, he took the sample to the Excise Lab at Vikas
     Bhawan ITO and deposited the same there vide RC No. 436/21.
     Thereafter, he came back to the PS and handed over the receiving
     copy to the MHC(M).
</p><p id="p_8">            He further deposed that he identify the case property if shown to
     him.
</p><p id="p_9">            Thereafter, MHC(M) had brought one empty white colored
     plastic cane with broken part seal, which was broken from the bottom.
     It is containing mud no. 3905/06. The witness had correctly identified
     the case property which is Ex. P-1.
</p><p id="p_10">            In his cross examination, he deposed that he left the PS at
     about 10:00 am for patrolling on foot. IO reached at the spot at 2:25
     pm on scooter. First of all IO recorded his statement. It is correct that
     the spot was surrounded by residential area. It is correct that no lady
     Ct. had come on the spot. He handed over the seal to the IO at PS on
     the next day. No memo was prepared in this regard. He left the spot
     for PS with tehrir at about 4:50 pm. He came back at the spot at about
     6.00 pm. The distance between PS and the spot is about 2 km. The
     whole writing work was done while sitting at the stairs of export factory
     at Dal Mill Road. They finally left the spot at about 6:40 pm. It is
     wrong to suggest that nothing was recovered from the possession of
     the accused or that she has been falsely implicated in the present
     case. It is further wrong to suggest that she was lifted from her house.
     It is further wrong to suggest that all the writing work was done while
     sitting at PS. It is wrong to suggest that he was deposing falsely.
</p>

<p id="p_11">  6. PW-3 ASI Rohtash Singh, deposed that on 26.02.2006,             he was
     posted as HC at PS Uttam Nagar. On that day on the receipt of DD


FIR NO. 144/06                State Vs. Saroj                (Page 4 of 11)
      No.24B regarding recovery of illicit liquor from the accused, he
     proceeded to the spot i.e Dal Meel Road, Near Export Factory, where
     he met Ct. Rajniesh, who handed accused with recovered plastic
     cane to him. Accused disclosed her name to be Saroj, accused
     present in the court that day and correctly identified by him. He asked
     4-5 persons to join as a witness but none agreed and left the spot
     without disclosing their names and address. He checked the cane and
     found it to be smelling of liquor. Thereafter, he recorded statement of
     Ct. Rajnish already Ex. PW2/A. He asked Ct. Rajnish to bring empty
     bucket and bottle of 750 ml at the spot. He checked and measured the
     quantity of liquor and found it to be 12 full bottles. He separated one
     bottle as sample sealed it with the seal of RS. Rest of the liquor were
     put back into the same can and it was also sealed with the seal of RS.
     He filled form M-29 at the spot. He seized entire case property by the
     memo already Ex. PW2/B bearing his signature at point-B. Seal was
     handed over to Ct. Rajnish. Thereafter, He prepared tehrir is already
     exhibited as Ex. PW1/B. He handed over the tehrir to Ct. Rajnish for
     the registration of FIR. Ct. Rajnish went to PS and got the FIR
     registered. He came back at the spot and handed over to him copy of
     the FIR and original tehrir. Thereafter, he prepared site plan which is
     already Ex. PW3/A at the instance of Ct. Rajnish. Thereafter, he
     arrested the accused vide memo is already Ex. PW2/C bearing his
     signature at point-B. Thereafter, case property was deposited in the
     Malkhana and accused was released on bail. He recorded the
     statement of witnesses. He also collected the result from the excise
     office Ex. PW3/B and filed the charge sheet in the court after
     completion of investigation.
</p><p id="p_12">           In his cross examination, he deposed that he left the PS at


FIR NO. 144/06                State Vs. Saroj               (Page 5 of 11)
      about 2:20 pm and reached the spot within 10 minutes. The spot was
     surrounded with residential area. Before sending rukka IO recorded
     the statement of 161 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_1">Cr.P.C</a>, site plan and arrest memo. Ct. Rajnish
     went to PS at about 4:50 pm and came back within 1 hour. Seal was
     handed over to Ct. Rajnish on the next day. All the writing work was
     done while sitting on pavement. Arrest memo was prepared at about
     5:30 to 5:45 pm. Finally they left the spot at about 6:45 pm. No lady
     constable was present during the whole proceedings. Case property
     was brought by him to the PS. It is wrong to suggest that accused was
     called from his house at PS and falsely implicated in the present case.
     It is further wrong to suggest that nothing was recovered from the
     possession of the accused. It is wrong to suggest that he was
     deposing falsely being police official at the instance of IO.
</p>

<p id="p_13">  7. PW-4 ASI Satyabir Singh, deposed that on 26.02.2006, he was posted
     as MHC(M) at PS Uttam Nagar. On that day, HC Rohtash Singh
     deposited the case property i.e one plastic cane and one sample bottle
     and form M-29 duly sealed with the seal of RS and in this regard he
     made entry in register no. 19 at serial no. 3905. Copy of the same is
     Ex. PW4/A.
</p><p id="p_14">             On 10.03.2006, one sample bottle of the present case sent to
     Excise Office through Ct. Jeetpal vide RC no. 436/21 for depositing
     the same at Excise Office. After depositing the same he handed over
     the copy of RC received to him.
</p>

<p id="p_15">  8. After prosecution evidence, statement of accused under <a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_2">section 313</a>
     Cr.P.C was recorded. All the incriminating evidence was put to the
     accused. Accused denied all the allegations stating that she has been


FIR NO. 144/06                 State Vs. Saroj                 (Page 6 of 11)
      falsely implicated in this case. However, accused did not want to lead
     any evidence in her defence.
</p>

<p id="p_16">  9. Arguments advanced by Ld. APP for the State and Ld. Defence
     counsel were heard. Record perused. Ld. defence counsel has argued
     that the case of prosecution is entirely based upon the testimony of
     police witnesses and is not independently corroborated. On the other
     hand, Ld. APP has submitted that the prosecution has been able to
     prove its case.
</p>

<p id="p_17">  10. It is cardinal principle of criminal jurisprudence that an accused is
     presumed to be innocent and therefore, the burden lies on the
     prosecution to prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable
     doubt. The prosecution is under a legal obligation to prove each and
     every ingredient of the offence beyond any doubt unless otherwise so
     provided by any statute. This general burden never shifts and it always
     rests on the prosecution.
</p>

<p id="p_18">  11. After going through the complete evidence and records of this case, I
     am of the view that accused namely Ms. Saroj deserves acquittal in
     this case on the following grounds :-
</p>

<p id="p_19">  12. Firstly, if the police personnel who has apprehended the accused with
     the illicit liquor was on patrolling duty, prosecution should have
     brought the relevant records showing their arrival and departure and
     should have proved by documentary evidence that he was on
     patrolling duty by producing DD entry for the same.
</p><p id="p_20">          As per the chapter 22 Rule 49 of the Punjab Police Rules, which


FIR NO. 144/06                   State Vs. Saroj            (Page 7 of 11)
      is reproduced as under:
</p><p id="p_21">     "Chapter 22 Rule 49 Matter to be entered in Register no.11. The
     following matters shall amongst others, be entered :
</p><p id="p_22">     (c) The hour of arrival and departure on duty at or from a police station
     of all enrolled police officers of whatever rank, whether posted at a
     police station or elsewhere with a statement of the nature of their duty.
     This entry shall be made immediately on arrival or prior to the
     departure of the officer concerned and shall be attested by the latter
     personally by signature or seal.
</p><p id="p_23">     Note: The term police station will include all places such as Police
     Lines and Police Posts where Register no.11 is maintained.
</p>

<p id="p_24">  13. In view of this rule, while deposing none of the prosecution witnesses
     has told that by what entry in register no.11, they were patrolling in the
     particular area. In the present case also, this provision has not been
     complied with by prosecution witnesses. The relevant entries
     regarding the arrival and departure of the police officials has not been
     proved on record. It has been held in Rattan Lal Vs. State 1987 (2)
     Crimes 29 the Hon'ble High Court held that :
</p><p id="p_25">             "wherein it has been observed that if the investigating agency
     deliberately ignores to comply with the provisions of the Act the Courts
     will have to approach their action with reservations. The matter has to
     be viewed with suspicion if the provisions of law are not strictly
     complied with and the least that can be said is that it is so done with
     an oblique motive. This failure to bring on record, the DD entries
     creates a reasonable doubt in the prosecution version and attributes
     oblique motive on the part of the prosecution".
</p><p id="p_26">  14. Secondly, the prosecution has examined four witnesses, however no


FIR NO. 144/06                 State Vs. Saroj                (Page 8 of 11)
      independent witness has been examined even though recovery
     witness has deposed that the accused was apprehended near
     residential area and IO had requested 4-5 passerby to join the
     investigation. It is not clear as to why no legal action was taken
     against such persons who had refused to be a witness. In the case of
     <a href="/doc/59733350/" id="a_3">Hemraj vs State of Haryana</a> (AIR 2005 SC 211:0) it was observed
     that "the fact that no independent witness though available, was
     examined and not even an explanation was sough:t to be given for not
     examining such witness is a serious infirmity in the prosecution case".
</p>

<p id="p_27">  15. In Roop Chand Vs. The State of Haryana 1999 (12) C.L.R, the Punjab
     and Haryana High Court held as under:-
</p><p id="p_28">           "It is well settled principle of the law that investigating Agency
     should join independent witness at the time of recovery of contraband
     articles, if they were available and their failure to do so in such a
     situation casts a shadow of doubt on the prosecution case. In the
     present case also, admittedly the independent witnesses were
     available at the time of recovery but they refused to associate
     themselves in the investigation. This explanation does not inspire
     confidence because the police officials who are the only witnesses
     examined in the case have not given the names and addresses of the
     persons contacted to join.     It is a very common excuse that the
     witnesses from the public refused to join the investigation. A police
     officer conducting investigation of a crime is entitled to ask anybody to
     join the investigation and on refusal by a person from the public the
     police officer can take action against such a person under the law.
     Had it been a fact that the witnesses from the public had refused to
     join the investigation, the investigating officer must have proceeded


FIR NO. 144/06                State Vs. Saroj                (Page 9 of 11)
      against them under the relevant provision of law. The failure to do so
     by the police officer is suggestive of the fact that the explanation for
     non joining the witnesses from the public is an after thought and is not
     worthy of credence. All these facts taken together make the
     prosecution case highly doubtful".
</p>

<p id="p_29">  16. Since all the witnesses are police personnels and the necessary
     safeguards in the investigation have not been followed by the
     investigating officer, I am of the view that charges of false implication
     cannot be ruled out at the instance of the police.
</p>

<p id="p_30">  17. Further as per the case of the prosecution, it is not clear to whom the
     seal after use was handed over and when the seal was returned to the
     IO. No memo has been prepared and proved on the record. The
     prosecution was bound to prove on the record as to when the seal was
     returned to the IO to remove the element of the tampering with the
     case property. Not only this, there is an unexplained delay in sending
     the sample to the excise laboratory. The incident is of 26.02.2006 and
     the sample was sent to the Excise laboratory on 10.03.2006. There is
     no evidence that the sample remained intact till delivery to the office of
     chemical examiner. Till that time, the sample remained in police
     possession. It was the duty of the police to send the samples to the
     laboratory without any unexplained delay which could rule out any
     tampering with the case property which was not done in the present
     case and the case property remained in the police station at the
     disposal of the police.

</p><p id="p_32">   18.Furthermore, there are couple of inconsistencies in the prosecution
     version. Case property when examined in the court, it was found that
     seal was partly broken, hence, recovery of illicit liquor as alleged by
     prosecution is doubtful. No source of light has been shown in the site
     plan.   It is not clear as to on what suspicion the accused was
     apprehended. Further the departure and arrival entries of the official
     witnesses have not been proved. The testimony of the official
     witnesses    in the present case is not strong enough to base the
     conviction of the accused. In the criminal law, the prosecution has to
     prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt, however, in
     the present case prosecution has miserably failed to do so.
</p>

<p id="p_33">  19. In view of above mentioned facts and circumstances, I hold that the
     prosecution has failed to prove its case against the accused beyond
     reasonable doubt. Accordingly, accused Ms. Saroj stands acquitted of
     the offence u/s 61 of the Punjab Excise Act, 1914. However, she shall
     furnish a fresh bail bond, which shall remain in force for a period of six
     months from today U/s 437A Cr. P. C. Documents if any be returned
     after cancellation of endorsement. The case property be confiscated
     and be destroyed after expiry of period of appeal.
