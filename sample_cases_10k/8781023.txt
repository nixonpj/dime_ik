          declined.  He further contended that the complaint filed 

          by   her   did   disclose   commission   of   cognizable   offences, 

          whereby, it became mandatory on the part of concerned 

          court   to   direct   concerned   SHO   to   register   FIR,   but 

          Ld.Metropolitan Magistrate failed to take the same into 

          consideration. He contended that the facts alleged in the 

          complaint   clearly   depicts   commission   of  cognizable  

          offences, for which   it is necessary that FIR should be 

          registered.  He contended that there are certain aspects 

          which   can   only   be   investigated   by   the   investigating 

          agency, therefore, the impugned order be set­aside and 

          necessary directions be issued to the concerned SHO.

          revisionist.   I   have   perused   the   material   on   the   Trial

          acted, contrary to the well established principles of Law, 

          or  the order  has  been  passed   without  any  evidence  to

                     summoned by the Court at     the instance of  
                     complainant, and the matter is   such which  
                     calls   for   investigation   by   a   State       agency.  
                     The     Magistrate     must     pass     an     order  
                     giving cogent reasons as to why he intends to
