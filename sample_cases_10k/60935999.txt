     With consent, heard finally.
     This order shall govern disposal of M.A.No.1733/2009
as well as M.A.No. 1752/2009 as both these appeal are
arising out of common award dated 24/09/2009 passed by
Third Additional Judge to the Court of First Additional Motor
Accident Tribunal, Gwalior    in Claim Case No. 149/2009,
whereby, a total compensation of Rs. 6,33,500/- has been
awarded to the claimants/parents of deceased Jitendra
Sharma, who died in road accident dated 26/6/2008.
     M.A.No. 1733/2009 has been preferred by claimants
for enhancement of claim amount awarded by Claims
Tribunal, whereas, M.A.No. 1752/2009 has been moved on
behalf of Insurance Company assailing the findings arrived at
by the Claims Tribunal.
     Precisely stated facts of the case are that on
26/6/2008</pre><p id="p_1">, deceased Jitendra Sharma by driving Maruti Van
bearing registration No. CG 04/HA-487 was coming towards
Gwalior and when he reached near Police Station, it is
alleged that driver of the offending vehicle by driving the
truck bearing registration No. UP 22/T-1427 in rash and
negligent manner and in wrong side dashed the van due to
                HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH

<p id="p_3">which deceased sustained grievous hurts in stomach and let
and died on the way to hospital. Claimants        filed a claim
case, in which the Tribunal has awarded a compensation of
Rs.6,33,500/- and Insurance Company was held liable for
payment of amount under award.
</p><p id="p_4">      Learned counsel for the claimants urged that the
amount of compensation awarded by the Claims Tribunal is
on lower side looking to the fact that deceased was a healthy
person and used to sell biscuits, grocery items and Guthkha
in nearby place and thereby he was earning Rs. 8,000/- per
month excluding all expenses. The income assessed by
Claims Tribunal is on the lower side and the amount awarded
under conventional heads is also on lower side.
</p><p id="p_5">      Learned counsel for the Insurance Company submits
that amount of award as awarded by learned Claims Tribunal
is on the higher side. The income of deceased as assessed
by the Claims Tribunal is on higher side looking to the fact no
documentary evidence viz., sales tax registration, purchase
bill, etc. have been produced by claimants to prove income of
the deceased.. The Tribunal has failed to consider the
grounds raised by Insurance Company regarding contributory
negligence.
</p><p id="p_6">      Heard learned counsel for the parties.
      As regards quantum of compensation, the Claims
Tribunal has awarded the impugned award in favour of
claimants after assessing the income of the deceased to the
tune of Rs. 72,000/- per annum and deducting 1/3 towards
                HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH

the age of mother. Rs. 2,000/- towards funeral expenses, Rs.
2,500/- towards loss of estate and Rs. 5,000- towards love
and affection were awarded.
</p><p id="p_9">      As per learned counsel for the claimants, deceased
was earning Rs. 8,000/- per month excluding all expense's,
however, in absence of any documentary prove regarding
income of deceased, the income as assessed by the Claims
Tribunal at Rs. 6,000/- per month, in the opinion of this Court
appears to be just and proper. 1/3 deduction towards
personal expenses and the multiplier of 13 as applied by the
Claims Tribunal also in the opinion of this Court are just and
proper. As regards amount awarded under conventional
head, in the opinion of this Court same are on the lower side
and same are enhanced by Rs. 15,000/-. Thus, the amount
of compensation as awarded by the Claims Tribunal is
liable to be enhanced by Rs.15,000/- (awarded towards loss
of estate, funeral expenses and love and affection)which
shall be payable along with the interest from the date of filing
of the claim petition.
</p><p id="p_10">      As regards M.A.No. 1752/2009 filed by Insurance
Company, in the opinion of this Court the objections as raised
by the Insurance Company in this appeal were already raised
by the Claims Tribunal and well discussed by the Claims
Tribunal in the impugned award and therefore, need no
consideration as Insurance Company failed to prove contrary
thereto.
