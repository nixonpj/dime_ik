 (BY SRI. S.S.KOLIWAD, ADV. FOR R2,
       R1-NOTICE DISPENSED WITH.)

      THIS MFA IS FILED U/S 30(1) OF THE W.C. ACT,
 1926, AGAINST THE JUDGMENT AND ORDER DATED:18-
 07-2008 PASSED IN WCA/NF.NO.75/2006 ON THE FILE OF
 THE LABOUR OFFICER AND COMMISSIONER FOR
                            :2:



WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION, HAVERI, PARTLY ALLOWING
THE CLAIM PETITION FOR COMPENSATION AND SEEKING
ENHANCEMENT OF COMPENSATION.

     THIS MFA COMING ON FOR ADMISSION,
THIS   DAY,  THE   COURT  DELIVERED THE
FOLLOWING: -
                 JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">     A claim application filed having been allowed

in part and compensation of Rs.1,63,995/- w ith

interest at 12%, after expiry of thirty days of the

judgment, having been ordered to be paid, feeling

aggrieved, the claimant filed this appeal.


</p><p id="p_2">     2.   Learned advocate for the appellant, firstly

contended      that   despite    the    credible      evidence

placed on record with regard to the wages of the

workman,       the    Commissioner           for   Workmen's

Compensation has erred in taking the minimum

wages     at   Rs.3,227=10      as     the     wage    of   the

workman.       Secondly, the non-awarding of interest

from the date the cause of action arose, is illegal.


</p><p id="p_3">     3.   Learned advocate for the 2 n d respondent,

on the other hand, made submissions in support of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                    :3:</span>


the     view      taken       by     the      Commissioner        for

Workmen's Compensation and sought upholding of

the impugned judgment and award.


</p><p id="p_4">       4.     Keeping in view the rival contentions and

the record of the case, the substantial questions

of    law     which   arise    for       determination    are     the

following:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">       (i)     Whether        the    Commissioner          for
               Workmen's Compensation is justified
               in taking the wages of the appellant
               at Rs.3,227=10 per month?
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">       (ii)    Whether    non-awarding           of   interest
               after thirty days from the date cause
               of action for claim arose, is illegal?</blockquote><p id="p_5">

</p><p id="p_6">       5.     The respondents have not questioned the

judgment and award directing them to pay the

determined       compensation            of   Rs.1,63,995/-      w ith

interest.
</p>
<p id="p_7">
</p><p id="p_8">       6.     The claimant has deposed in the case and

has stated that he was being paid by his employer,

wages of Rs.6,000/- per month and daily bhata of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                  :4:</span>


Rs.50/-.          The     employer     did   not       file   either

statement of objections to the claim petition nor

cross-examined the workman, who was working as

a driver.        The accident in question having taken

place on 01.06.2006, nothing material having been

elicited    in     the   cross-examination        of    AW1,    the

wages ought to have been taken at Rs.4,000/- per

month.      The Commissioner, though has taken note

of   the     evidence       of    workman,         without      any

justification, has taken the minimum wages fixed

by the Government, as the wages of the workman.

There      being    credible     evidence    on    record,     w ith

regard     to    the     employment,     employment           injury

sustained and the wages of the                    workman, the

Commissioner is unjustified in taking the wages of

the workman at Rs.3,229=10.
</p>
<p id="p_9">
</p><p id="p_10">     7.     In view of the credible evidence available

on record of the claim petition, the wages of the

workman can be taken at Rs.4,000/- per month.

Thus,     the    compensation      payable    is       Rs.2,400   X
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                               :5:</span>


201.66 x 42/100 = Rs.2,03,273/-.                 Consequently,

the appellant is entitled to enhanced compensation

of Rs.39,278/- and the interest.


</p><p id="p_11">      8.    In    ORIENTAL          INSURANCE           COMPANY

LIMITED Vs. SIBI GEORGE AND OTHERS, 2012

ACJ    2126,     the   Apex   Court       has    held   that   the

compensation falls due on the date of accident and

interest starts accruing one month after the date

of accident.
</p>
<p id="p_12">
</p><p id="p_13">      9.    In the instant case, the accident having

occurred    on    01.06.2006        and    the   compensation

having not been paid or deposited within thirty

days period therefrom, the liability to pay interest

on    the   compensation       amount       has     started    on

01.07.2006.       The Commissioner is unjustified in

not awarding interest on the compensation amount

till the expiry of thirty days from the date of

judgment.      In view of the aforesaid decision of the

Apex Court, the workman is entitled to payment of

interest at 12% per annum, on Rs.2,03,273/-.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                              :6:</span>


</p><p id="p_14">       The compensation of Rs.1,63,995/- awarded

and    the   interest   thereon     at    12%    having      been

deposited,      the     insurance        company-respondent

No.2    shall   deposit    the   balance       amount   in    the

Registry of this Court within two months.

</p><p id="p_15">       Upon the deposit, 50% be released to the

claimant/appellant and balance amount shall be

invested in fixed deposit in any nationalised bank

in the name of claimant/appellant, for a period of

five   years,    with     provision      for   withdrawal      of

interest periodically.
</p>
<p id="p_16">       Draw the modified award accordingly.
