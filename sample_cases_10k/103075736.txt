CORAM:              HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE AJAI LAMBA



PRESENT: -          Mr. J.S. Toor, Advocate, for the petitioner.


                              .     .      .



AJAI LAMBA, J (Oral)

</pre><p id="p_1">1.                  This petition has been filed praying for issuance of a

writ in the nature of certiorari, quashing order dated             6.8.2008

(Annexure P-1) vide which the petitioner has been asked to furnish

record/ sanad indicating that petitioner had been appointed as

Lambardar. It has further been pointed out in the said document that the

petitioner is not Lambardar according to the revenue record, and

therefore, in case the petitioner attests any document as Lambardar in

future, he would be liable to face consequences.

</p><p id="p_2">2.                  Learned counsel contends that the petitioner has
 CWP No.8944 of 2011                                       [2]



been working as Lambardar and has an Identity Card. In such

circumstances, impugned order dated 6.8.2008 (Annexure P-1) could not

have been passed.
</p>
<p id="p_3">3.                    I have considered the contention of learned counsel

for the petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_4">4.                    Identity Card is issued in consequence of issuance of

a sanad, vide which a person is appointed as Lambardar. Appointment of

Lambardar ensues after an order to that effect is passed by Collector

while exercising his powers under Rule 15 of the Punjab Land Revenue

Rules (as applicable to Punjab). The respondents under the

circumstances have a right to ask the petitioner to produce the Sanad

vide which he has, allegedly, been appointed Lambardar. The said issue

assumes relevance because the revenue record does not indicate that

petitioner is the Lambardar. In case the petitioner was appointed

Lambardar, he would have a copy of the Sanad, which he can produce in

response to the impugned notice/ order. In such circumstances, I do not

find any illegality in passing of order dated 6.8.2008 (Annexure P-1).

</p><p id="p_5">5.                    No ground for interference in extraordinary writ

jurisdiction is made out.
</p>
<p id="p_6">6.                    The petition is dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_7">7.                    It is however made clear that in response to the

impugned order, the petitioner would be at liberty to show sanad issued

in his favour appointing him as Lambardar whereupon the official

respondents can pass appropriate orders as required by law.</p><pre id="pre_3">

                                                            (AJAI LAMBA)
