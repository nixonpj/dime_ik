                (O.P. SEN Vs THE STATE OF MADHYA PRADESH)


22-06-2015
Shri Atul Choudhary for the appellant.
Shri Pushpendra Yadav, Government Advocate, for the State on
advance notice.
Shri P.K. Mishra for respondent Nos. 2 and 3, on advance notice.</pre>
<p id="p_1">The default, if any pointed out by the office if not removed, be
removed during course of the day.
</p><p id="p_2">It is pointed out by Shri Choudhary that in this writ appeal,
appellant is only challenging part of the order passed by the Writ
Court denying backwages to the appellant after the impugned
order of compulsory retirement was quashed by the learned
Court. Learned counsel points out that identical writ appeals filed
have been decided by a Coordinate Bench of this Court and a
consolidated order-dated 21.9.2012 has been passed in various
cases. Learned counsel produces a copy of the order and points
out that in the matter of payment of backwages, the directions
issued by the Coordinate Bench of this court in Writ Appeal No.
1075/2011 and other cases be applied and similar benefit
extended to the present appellant also.
</p><p id="p_3">Even though Shri P.K. Mishra points out that the appellant has
filed this petition after a long period of time and is now
challenging the order passed by the writ Court in the year 2011,
the fact remains that in the matter of granting relief to identically
situated employees, parity has to be maintained and when a
Coordinate Bench of this Court has granted certain relief to
certain class of employees, then ground of delay should not come
in the way of maintaining parity in the matter of grant of relief,
particularly to retired employees. Keeping in view the same, the
objections raised by Shri P.K. Mishra in the matter of delay is
 over-ruled.
</p><p id="p_4">We find that in Writ Appeal No.1075/2011 and other connected
matter, after taking note of orders passed by Coordinate Bench of
this Court in various other cases and of the Supreme Court, the
following directions have been issued:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">     â5.           The Division Bench considering the aforesaid and the applicability
     of the provisions as contained in the Standard Standing Order under the Act of
     1961 held that in absence of any provisions in the aforesaid Act for compulsory
     retirement, the instructions issued by the State Government for retiring the
     employees were void ab initio and affirmed the order passed by the Single Bench.
     The Division Bench further directed for payment of 50% back wages to the
     employees.
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_2">             The aforesaid order was subject matter of SLP (Civil)
     No.18125-18126/2012 before the Apex Court. The Apex Court in the SLP held thus:-
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_3">             â        These petitions are directed against order dated 20.3.2012 of
             the Division bench of the Madhya Pradesh High Court whereby the writ
             appeals filed by the petitioners were dismissed and the declaration of
             invalidity granted by the learned Single Judge qua their decision to
             prematurely retire the respondents was upheld. The petitioners have also
             questioned the direction given by the Division Bench for payment of 50%
             back wages to the respondents.
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_4">                     Learned counsel for the petitioners fairly stated that there is no
             provision in the Madhya Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation
                                                                                        st
             Employees Service Regulations, which were enforced with effect from 1
             June, 1970 and the Madhya Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation
             Employees Conduct, Discipline and Appeal Regulations, 1975 for
             retirement of the employees after completing 20 years service or on
             attaining the age of 50 years but argued that the High Court was not
             justified in interfering with the exercise undertaken for premature
             retirement of the respondents because the Corporation was facing acute
             financial crisis. She further argued that the Division Bench committed
             serious error by partly allowing the appeals filed by the respondents and
             directing payment of 50% back wages to the respondents.
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_5">                     In our view there is no merit in the arguments of the learned
             counsel. Since the regulation under <a href="/doc/1193128/" id="a_1">Section 45(1)</a> of the Road Transport
             Corporation Act, 1950, which are statutory in nature, do not postulate pre-
             mature retirement of the employees on completion of 20 years service or
             on       attaining the age of 50 years, the action taken by the petitioner to
              retire the respondents was ex-facie without jurisdiction and the High Court
             did not commit any error by quashing the same and directing
             reinstatement of the respondents with 50% back wages.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_6">                      The special leave petitions are accordingly dismissed. The
             petitioners are directed to implement the orders passed by the learned
             Single Judge and the Division Bench of the High Court within a period of
             four weeks from today.â


</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_7">     6.     As the order passed by the Gwalior Bench directing back wages has been
     affirmed by the Apex Court by a detailed order, we find that the appellant is
     entitled for 50% back wages from the date of his compulsory retirement till the
     order passed by the Single Bench and thereafter full wages till he attained the age
     of superannuation. So far as contention of the respondents that under <a href="/doc/73782/" id="a_2">Section
     34(2)</a> of the Road Transport Corporation Act, 1950, the State Government was
     empowered to issue general instructions is
     concerned, this question was already considered by the Division Bench referred
     hereinabove and was repelled. Even for the sake of arguments, it is found that the
     specific provisions as contained in <a href="/doc/1958843/" id="a_3">Section 34</a> (2) were not considered then it was
     duty of the respondents to raise this issue before the Apex Court while assailing
     the order passed in Umesh Kumar Verma, but the
     aforesaid ground was not raised or pressed before the Apex Court then the
     respondents cannot be permitted to raise this issue in this appeal.</blockquote>


<p id="p_5">     7.    The controversy has already been decided by the Division Bench in
     Umesh Kumar Verma (supra) affirmed by the Apex Court and also by this Court
     in Rewaram Jat (supra). In view of aforesaid, all the appeals are found without

     merits and are dismissed with no order as to costs.â



Keeping in view the aforesaid, we allow this writ appeal and the
modify the order passed by the learned writ Court, as indicated
hereinabove in the order passed by the Coordinate Bench in Writ
Appeal No.1075/2011, and dispose of this writ appeal also with
identical directions.
</p><p id="p_6">Case of the appellant be also processed and identical benefit as
has been directed by this Court in Writ Appeal No. 1075/2011 and
other cases on 21.9.2012, be extended to the present appellant
also.
</p><p id="p_7">With the aforesaid observations, the writ appeal stands disposed
of.
</p><p id="p_8"> CC as per rules.</p><pre id="pre_2">
