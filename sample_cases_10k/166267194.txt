<p id="p_1">       Present revision petition has been filed against order dt. 29.09.2012 passed 

by Ld. Metropolitan Magistrate­07 (Central), Delhi whereby application filed by 

the petitioner / complainant u/s 156(3) <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_1">CrPC</a> has been dismissed.


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">Crl.Rev. No.62/12                          1</span>
</p><p id="p_2"> 2.             Learned counsel for petitioner has contended that it has not been 

rightly observed by learned Metropolitan Magistrate that the entire evidence is 

within the reach of the complainant.  It has been submitted that only police can 

collect   evidence   regarding   transfer   of   the   property   of   the   company   by   the 

husband   in   his   own   name   and   about   forgery   of   documents.     Therefore,   the 

contention   is   that   Learned   Metropolitan   Magistrate   should   have   referred   the 

complaint to the police for registration of case and investigation in accordance 

with law.
</p>
<p id="p_3">3.             <a href="/doc/151904/" id="a_2">In M/s Skipper Beverages P. Ltd v. State</a> 2001 IV AD (Delhi) 

625=2001 (3) RCR (Criminal) 514, our Hon'ble High Court has observed that 

powers   under   <a href="/doc/1291024/" id="a_3">Section   156</a>   CrPC   are   to   be   exercised   judiciously   and   that 

where allegations are not serious and complainant himself is in possession of 

evidence to prove allegations, there is no need to exercise these powers.

</p><p id="p_4">4.             Application   u/s   156(3)   <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_4">CrPC</a>   was   filed   by   the   petitioner   / 

complainant in complaint no. 54/11.  Case of the petitioner / complainant as per 

the complaint no. 54/11 is that she got married to the respondent herein in 1998, 

but ultimately her husband subjected her to cruelty on the ground that she had 

not   brought   sufficient   dowry   as   alleged   by   the   complainant   /   petitioner,   her 

husband and his family members pressurize her parents and under pressure her 

father opened a company in the name and style of Sai Voyages Pvt. Ltd. in the 



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">Crl.Rev. No.62/12                               2</span>
 year   1998   wherein,   she   (complainant)   and   her   husband     (   respondent)   were 

having 50% shares.  A sum of Rs. 10 Lacs was invested by her father for starting 

the company.   In March, 2009, her father was admitted in ICU.   During those 

days,   the   respondent   obtained   her   signatures(   of   the   complainant)   on   blank 

papers and become authorized signatory of the said company.   In April 2009, 

after demise of her father, her husband and his family members threw her out of 

the   matrimonial   house   with   her   minor   child   and   since   then   she   is   living 

separately   from   her   husband.     It  is   the   case   of   the   complainant   that  several 

movable and immovable properties were purchased in the name of the aforesaid 

company.  
</p>
<p id="p_5">       These properties included :­

</p><p id="p_6">       1.      Office at 13/29, 303, 3rd Floor, Adhunik Chambers, East Patel 

               Nagar, New Delhi­ 110008.
</p>
<p id="p_7">       2.      Office at 30/28,  1st Floor, East Patel Nagar, New Delhi­ 110008.

</p><p id="p_8">       3.      Office at 30/29,  3rd Floor, East Patel Nagar, New Delhi­ 110008. 

</p><p id="p_9">5.     Further it is case of the petitioner that she filed a petition under Protection 

of Women from <a href="/doc/542601/" id="a_5">Domestic Violence Act</a> on 04.02.2011.   In that petition, her 

husband testified on affidavit that he had transferred two properties no. 30/28 

and 30/29 referred to above in his sole name by way of valid resolution and 

signatures.     Case of the petitioner is that since she has been living separately 

from her husband w.e.f April 2009, she did not sign any resolution for transfer 

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">Crl.Rev. No.62/12                               3</span>
 of any property and further that no resolution was passed with her consent or 

within her knowledge.   So case of the complainant­petitioner is that properties 

have been fraudulently transferred /misappropriated by the accused by forging 

her signatures and by manipulating record of the company.  

</p><p id="p_10">6.     In addition thereto, it has been alleged that her husband has sold cars of 

the company and misappropriated the sale consideration with intent to cheat her 

and creditors.
</p>
<p id="p_11">7.     As   noticed   above,   petitioner   and   her   husband   were   directors   of   the 

company which was started in the year 1998 under the name and style of Sai 

Voyages Pvt. Ltd. with equal shares.   The complainant­petitioner has levelled 

specific allegations that two properties no. 30/28,   1st  Floor, East Patel Nagar, 

New Delhi­ 110008 and 30/29,  3rd Floor, East Patel Nagar, New Delhi­ 110008 

belonging to the company have been transfered by her husband in his own name 

by forging her signatures and by manipulating record of the company and as 

such criminally misappropriated the amount to cheat her and creditors.  It is also 

her case that she never signed any resolution for transfer of the property but her 

husband   has   pleaded   in   petition   for   Protection   of   Women   from   <a href="/doc/542601/" id="a_6">Domestic 

Violence Act</a> that the aforesaid properties were transferred by way of a valid 

resolution and signatures.   Complainant can lead evidence regarding execution 

of the sale deed in respect of the above referred two properties by summoning 

witnesses from the offiec of Sub­Registrar but as regards manipulation in the 

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">Crl.Rev. No.62/12                            4</span>
 records of the company, complainant­petitioner would not be able to summon 

the   same.   When   the   complainant­petitioner   has   specifically   alleged   that   her 

signatures have been forged on certain record, only police can investigate the 

matter and submit report.  Therefore it cannot be said that the entire material is 

within the reach of the complainant­petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_12">8.     In   view  of  the  above  discussion, this Court  finds that  impugned order 

deserves to be set aside and the complaint is required to be sent to police for 

registration of case and investigation.
</p>
<p id="p_13">9.     In view of the above findings revision petition is allowed.  Complaint is 

ordered to be sent to the police for registration of the case and investigation in 

accordance with law and for report.
</p>
<p id="p_14">10.    Trial Court record be returned.  File of revision be consigned to Record 

Room.            
</p>
<p id="p_15">11.    Petitioner to appear before the Trial Court on 15.01.2013.</p><pre id="pre_2">
