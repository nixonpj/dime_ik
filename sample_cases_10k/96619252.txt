*      IN THE HIGH COURT OF DELHI AT NEW DELHI

       JUSTICE S. MURALIDHAR
       JUSTICE V. KAMESWAR RAO
                               JUDGMENT
</pre><pre id="pre_2">       %                        04.09.2018

Dr. S. Muralidhar, J.:
</pre><p id="p_1">1. This appeal is directed against the judgement dated 20th January 2018
passed by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Shahdara in SC
No.52/2017 arising out of FIR No.483/2013 registered at PS Seema Puri
convicting the Appellant for the offence under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_1">Section 302</a> IPC and the
order on sentence dated 29th January 2018 whereby the Appellant was
sentenced to undergo life imprisonment with fine of Rs.10,000/- and in
default of payment of fine, to further simple imprisonment („SI‟) for three
months.
</p>

<p id="p_2">2. The Appellant was charged with having murdered his wife Salma Begum
at around 3:45 pm on 12th September 2013 at Jain Mandir Jhuggi, MCD
Park by stabbing her with a knife. In the impugned order on sentence, after
noting that the monthly income of the convict was Rs.5,000/- and that he


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">Crl A No. 585 of 2018                                          Page 1 of 11</span>
 does not have any movable or immovable property, the trial Court was of
the view that the Appellant was not capable of paying compensation to his
own children and opined that it was not a case fit for grant of compensation.
</p>

<p id="p_3">Investigation and inquiries
</p><p id="p_4">3. The criminal justice system was set in motion when a call was received at
the Police Control Room at around 3:44 pm on 12th September 2013
providing information to the effect that a stabbing incident had taken place
near the sauchalya (toilet) near Jain Mandir. The short message was "ek lady
ko chaku maara hai jiski condition serious hai". The noting on the right
hand column of the same PCR form at around 3:51 pm by the police team
which reached there was that the persons present there were saying that a
man had stabbed his wife with the knife and had run away and that the
victim woman had been taken to the hospital already.
</p>

<p id="p_5">4. The Medico Legal Certificate („MLC‟) issued by GTB Hospital, Shahdara
(Ex.PW-13/A) reveals that the deceased was brought to the hospital at 4:14
pm on 12th September 2013 by her son Monu @ Md. Saleem (PW-17). She
was declared brought dead.
</p>

<p id="p_6">5. SI Monu Chauhan (PW-19) deposed that at around 3:56 pm, he received
DD No.30A telephonically about the stabbing incident. He rushed to the
spot and found that blood was lying in the park near the Jain Mandir jhuggis.
A pair of ladies‟ slippers and a dupatta were lying there and were having
bloodstains. Leaving behind Ct. Ravinder Tomar (PW-18) who had
accompanied him, PW-19 proceeded to GTB Hospital and obtained the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">Crl A No. 585 of 2018                                            Page 2 of 11</span>
 aforementioned MLC. The daughter of the deceased Asma (PW-2) met him
at the hospital. After making inquiries from her, PW-19 brought PW-2 back
to the spot. He found Inspector Lekh Singh (PW-22) and the crime team
present there. PW-19 recorded the statement of PW-2 at the spot
(Ex.PW-2/A) and thereafter prepared the tehrir and sent it to the PS through
Ct. Ravinder (PW-18) for registration of the FIR. The FIR (Ex.PW-1/A)
came to be registered at 6:35 pm.


</p><p id="p_7">6. In the initial statement given by PW-2 to the police, she stated that she
and her mother were separating the kabaad (junk) near the Jain Mandir. Her
mother had asked for water which PW-2 fetched. After that, she asked PW-2
to get some tea which she did. While they were still separating the kabaad,
her father (Appellant herein) came there with a knife and questioned the
deceased about Md. Rafiq (PW-3). An exchange of words ensued after
which the Appellant is stated to have inflicted stab wounds on the deceased
with the knife and fled.
</p>

<p id="p_8">Medical examination
</p><p id="p_9">7. The post mortem examination of the deceased was performed on the
following day, i.e. 13th September 2013 by Dr. Neha Gupta (PW-12). She
noticed as many as 11 incised stab wounds all over the body of the deceased.
Injury nos. 3, 4, 5, and 6 which were stab wounds inflicted on either side of
the chest and abdomen of the deceased were held to have been individually
and collectively sufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of nature. It
must be mentioned that there were also incised stab wounds (injury no.7) on
the neck and several other parts of the body. The photographs of the body
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">Crl A No. 585 of 2018                                             Page 3 of 11</span>
 showed that even the entire intestines had obtruded as a result of the knife
wounds to the abdominal area.
</p>
<p id="p_10">8. Subsequently, when the knife used to commit the offence was produced
before the same doctor, she opined that the injuries mentioned in the post
mortem report were possible by the same weapon. PW-12 was subjected to
cross-examination but nothing useful emerged to doubt that the deceased
died a homicidal death as a result of the multiple stab wounds caused with
the knife.
</p>

<p id="p_11">Arrest and seizures
</p><p id="p_12">9. The Investigating Officer („IO‟), viz. Inspector Lekh Singh (PW-22),
stated that on the basis of secret information, they were able to locate the
Appellant near Dargah Firozshah Kotla on 19th September 2013, and
apprehend him. His personal search was undertaken and his disclosure
statements recorded. He purportedly disclosed inter alia that he had thrown
the weapon of offence in the drain near the shop of Ajju kabaadi and that the
clothes worn by him were thrown at the godown at Plot No.11 in Vikram
Enclave. He is supposed to have then led the police to both places and got
recovered the knife and bloodstained white kurta.
</p>

<p id="p_13">The trial
</p><p id="p_14">10. After the chargesheet was filed, charges were framed by the trial Court
by an order dated 24th March 2014 in the manner indicated hereinbefore. On
behalf of the prosecution, 25 witnesses were examined. When the
incriminating circumstances were put to the Appellant under Section 313

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">Crl A No. 585 of 2018                                           Page 4 of 11</span>
 Cr PC, he denied each one of them. He maintained that he had been falsely
implicated as his step children were attempting to grab his property. No
defence witness was examined.
</p>

<p id="p_15">Trial Court judgment
</p><p id="p_16">11. In the impugned judgment, the trial Court came to the following
conclusions:
</p><p id="p_17">(i)     The eye witness testimony of Asma (PW-2) and the testimony of
        Monu (PW-17) was reliable and truthful. There was no reason to
        disbelieve their testimonies as they had remained consistent
        throughout. Their testimonies could be safely relied upon for
        determining the guilt of the Appellant.
</p><p id="p_18">(ii)    PW-22 had been able to explain the apparent discrepancy as regards
        the place of arrest of the Appellant being mentioned in the arrest
        memo (Ex.PW-21/A) as PS Seema Puri instead of the actual place of
        arrest. PW-22 clarified that no document had been prepared at the
        spot where they remained only for about 10-15 minutes.
</p><p id="p_19">(iii)   The prosecution had been able to prove the recovery of the weapon of
        offence which in the FSL report was shown to contain human blood
        although the DNA profile could not be generated on account of
        degradation. That the weapon used was a kitchen knife was also
        proved.
</p><p id="p_20">(iv)    In view of the reliable testimony of PW-2, the lack of independent
        witnesses to the recoveries did not affect the case of the prosecution
        adversely. The motive for the commission of the crime was explained
        by Md. Rafiq (PW-3). He deposed that on 12th September 2013 at
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">Crl A No. 585 of 2018                                            Page 5 of 11</span>
        around 2:30 pm, while he was present at the house of his elder sister-
       in-law, the Appellant came there and questioned him about being
       there. He lost his temper and directed him to leave the place failing
       which he would kill him. When PW-3 replied that he was not afraid of
       the Appellant, the latter threatened him by stating that if he did not
       obey his direction, his mother, i.e. the deceased, would be killed.
       PW-3 was not the biological son of the Appellant who had divorced
       his mother six months prior to the incident.
</p>

<p id="p_21">12. The trial Court also discussed the apparent discrepancies regarding the
time when the incident took place and concluded that these were not major
contradictions which could discredit the case of the prosecution. As regards
the bloodstains on the kurta of the deceased not matching with the blood
group of the deceased, the trial Court opined that since the Appellant was
arrested seven days after the incident, there was ample time for him to
"mislead the investigation". Thus, it was held that this discrepancy "did not
cast any doubt on the case of the prosecution".
</p>

<p id="p_22">13. The Court has heard the submissions of learned counsel for the
Appellant as well as learned APP for the State.
</p>

<p id="p_23">Evidence of PW-2
</p><p id="p_24">14. The prosecution relies heavily on the testimony of Asma (PW-2) who
was aged around twelve years at the time of the deposition in Court on
15th May 2014. Although she initially stated that the incident took place at
around 4:15 pm, in her subsequent cross-examination, she clarified that it
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">Crl A No. 585 of 2018                                           Page 6 of 11</span>
 was around 3:45 pm when the Appellant fled the spot after giving knife
blows to the deceased. This discrepancy, in the considered view of this
Court, is not serious enough to discredit her entire testimony particularly
since she appears to be consistent as regards the material aspects of the
incident as spoken of by her in her initial statement to the police. Further,
although in her examination-in-chief she mentioned about the Appellant
coming from behind and slitting the throat of her mother, in response to
further questions put to her by the APP, she clarified about the multiple stab
injuries given by Appellant to her mother on the neck, chest, stomach, hand,
etc.
</p>

<p id="p_25">15. It was repeatedly urged by learned counsel for the Appellant that PW-2
was a planted witness and her presence at the spot did not appear to be
natural. The Court is unable to agree with the above submission. It has
emerged in the cross-examination of PW-2 that she was attending school in
the 5th standard and that her school that day had been over by 1 pm. She
specifically mentioned both in her initial statement to the police as well as in
her deposition in Court that her mother had first asked for water and then
again for tea which she fetched on each occasion. There is no question of a
twelve year old child seeking to falsely implicate her father when perhaps
she was dependent on him and her mother for her own survival. Not a single
justification is provided for doubting the motives of PW-2 and why she
would falsely implicate her own father.
</p>

<p id="p_26">16. It was then pointed out that in her cross-examination she had stated that
"at the time of incident I along with Nazma and Ruby were present at the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">Crl A No. 585 of 2018                                              Page 7 of 11</span>
 jhuggi" and that this contradicted her statement that she was present at the
spot when her mother was stabbed which was about five minutes away from
her jhuggi. However, this statement which occurs in the cross-examination
of PW-2 must be read in the context of the statements made prior and
subsequent thereto which read as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">       "At the time of incident, my brother Rafiq was living with us.
       At that time he also used to deal in junk. He was not having
       mobile phone at that time. At that time no one was having
       mobile phone in my family. Jain Mandir is at the distance of
       about five minutes from my jhuggi. At the time of incident, I
       along with Nazma and Ruby were present at out jhuggi. It is
       correct that Jain Mandir is situated in a thickly populated area."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_27">17. When read together with the above statements, it is plain that the witness
is explaining that when the incident took place, they were all residing at
their jhuggi and that at the precise time when the stabbing took place, she
was present where her mother was. She in fact also states that there were 10-
12 persons present at the spot at the time of the incident because some other
persons were also sorting the kabaad. Even the Appellant used to deal with
kabaad at Preet Vihar, Laxmi Nagar. She was also careful to mention that
her brother Monu (PW-17) on that particular day did not accompany PW-2
and her mother for that purpose. He was in fact supposed to help the
Appellant and the quarrel with the deceased was triggered on the fateful day
with the deceased telling the Appellant that Monu (PW-17) would not
accompany him for that job.
</p>
<p id="p_28">Evidence of PW-17
</p><p id="p_29">18. PW-2 has also been corroborated by Monu (PW-17) himself who speaks
about remaining in the jhuggi at the relevant time and the neighbour
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">Crl A No. 585 of 2018                                             Page 8 of 11</span>
 informing him that his mother had been killed by the Appellant. Thereafter,
PW-17 rushed to the spot where he found his mother lying in a pool of blood
and not speaking. He stated how PW-2 who was present there informed him
that the deceased had been killed by the Appellant. He then lifted his
mother‟s body and put it onto the rehri and took her to GTB Hospital.
</p>
<p id="p_30">19. Learned counsel for the Appellant pointed out that there was no evidence
to show that either the rehri or the clothes of PW-17 were bloodstained if in
fact he had lifted the deceased and taken her to the hospital. The Court has
already adverted to the MLC which mentions that the deceased was brought
to the hospital by PW-17. This is sufficient corroboration of the fact that it
was PW-17 who took her to the hospital. As regards his own clothes or the
rehri not having bloodstains, his cross-examination does not show that any
such suggestion was given to him. In any event, the mere fact that the
clothes of PW-17 may not have been collected does not discredit either his
testimony or the testimony of PW-2.
</p>
<p id="p_31">20. The Court concurs with the conclusion reached by the trial Court that the
unshaken testimony of PW-2, corroborated in certain key aspects by that of
PW-17, is truthful and reliable and can safely form the basis for deciding the
guilt of the Appellant.
</p>

<p id="p_32">Scene of crime
</p><p id="p_33">21. The learned counsel for the Appellant pointed out that the place of the
incident itself was not clear. The PCR form mentioned it to be near the
sauchalya whereas according to PW-2, it was near the Jain Mandir.
Referring to the scaled site plan (Ex.PW-15/A), it was submitted that there is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">Crl A No. 585 of 2018                                            Page 9 of 11</span>
 no mention therein of either the sauchalya or the Jain Mandir and the place
of incident is shown to be in an open park.
</p>
<p id="p_34">22. The Court has also viewed the unscaled site plan (Ex.PW-21/H) which
does indicate the location of the sauchalya and the Jain Mandir which were
for some reason not indicated in the scaled site plan. Also, the incident
happened near the Jain Mandir jhuggis as originally noted by the police and
there is no precise address as such indicated in either the unscaled or scaled
site plans. Considering that the deceased was being helped by PW-2 in
sorting out the kabaad, there is no major contradiction in PW-2 describing
the location where the incident took place.
</p>

<p id="p_35">23. This is essentially a case based on direct evidence where the 12 year old
daughter of the Appellant has spoken clearly and cogently about his stabbing
her mother multiple times resulting in her death. The observations of the
Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/168392135/" id="a_2">Kalyan v. State of U.P</a>. (2001) 9 SCC 632 which was
relied upon by the learned counsel for the Appellant regarding the distance
to be travelled from the conclusion from „may be‟ to „must be‟ cannot apply
in the facts and circumstances of the present case. The prosecution has been
able to establish beyond reasonable doubt that it is the Appellant and no one
else who murdered his wife. For the aforementioned reasons, the Court finds
no grounds to interfere with the impugned judgment and order on sentence
of the trial Court.
</p>
<p id="p_36">24. The appeal and the application are dismissed. The trial Court record be
returned together with a certified copy of this judgment.
</p>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">Crl A No. 585 of 2018                                            Page 10 of 11</span>
<p id="p_37"> 25. Considering that no compensation was awarded to the dependants of the
deceased by the trial Court and considering that the Victims Compensation
Scheme under Section 357A Cr PC is to be administered by the Delhi State
Legal Services Authority („DSLSA‟), the Court directs the Secretary
DSLSA to examine the matter and ascertain if any dependent children of the
deceased require to be compensated and/or assisted in any manner
whatsoever. For this purpose, a copy of this judgment be delivered
immediately to the Secretary, DSLSA who will take a decision thereon and
implement it within three months from today.
