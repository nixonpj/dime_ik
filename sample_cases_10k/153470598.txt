<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">C. S. No. 391/11                                                             1</span>
                                     Kotak Mahindra Bank Vs. Rajender Singh

             incorporated and registered under the <a href="/doc/257409/" id="a_1">Indian Companies
             Act</a>, 1956. The defendant approached the ICICI bank for
             financial assistance for purchase of a vehicle, namely
             "Hyundai Santro". The ICICI bank sanctioned a loan of Rs.
             3,40,000/- in favour of the defendant.           The defendant
             executed credit facility application form dated 19.05.2007 in
             favour   of   the   plaintiff,   deed   of   hypothecation   and
             irrevocable power of attorney etc.       It was agreed that the
             defendant will return the entire amount in 60 monthly
             installments of Rs. 7868/- each.        The defendant did not
             adhere to the schedule of payment and defaulted in making
             payment.      There is an outstanding of Rs. 3,94,603.84
             against the defendant. Legal notice dated 12.06.08 was
             also sent to the defendant, but despite that, he did not
             return the amount.        ICICI Bank assigned this loan to
             present plaintiff vide deed of assignment, therefore, case
             was filed by present plaintiff for recovery.

<p id="p_3">          3. Summons of the suit was sent to the defendant on PF &amp;
             RC, but he could not be served. Ultimately, it was ordered
             that he be served by substituted service by way of
             publication in national newspaper 'Statesman'.               The
             publication appeared in newspaper "Statesman" dated
             23.01.2010. Despite that, he did not appear and was
             proceeded ex-parte.              Case was fixed for ex-parte
             evidence.

</p><p id="p_5">          4. The plaintiff examined Sh. Pankaj Wasan, who supported
             the plaintiff's case and proved the documents i. e. the copy
             of Board of Resolution is Ex.PW1/1.          Copy of deed of
             Assignment       and assignment of debts recoverable are
             Ex.PW1/2 and PW1/3. He proved the Credit facility
             application form as Ex.PW1/4, Deed of hypothecation as
             Ex.PW1/5. He proved the irrevocable power of attorney as
             Ex.PW1/6.       Copy of notice along with postal receipt as
             Ex.PW1/7 and PW1/8. He also proved the statement of
             account as Ex.PW1/9, according to which the defendant is
             liable to pay a sum of Rs.3,94,603.84. There is no reason
             to disbelieve the testimony and the documents placed on
             record by the plaintiff. However, after going through the
             documents of the plaintiff, particularly, the accounts and the
             details mentioned in the notice, I found that the principal
             amount, which the defendant is liable to pay i.e. principal
             outstanding is    Rs. 3,94,603.84 along with late payment
             penalty charges i.e Rs. 4,719/-.        Besides that plaintiff is
             also entitled to the cheque bouncing charges amounting to
             Rs. 4350/- and interest of that month is Rs.1589.93. The
             plaintiff is also asking for foreclosure charges amounting to
             Rs.19,022.91 which in view of the RBI guidelines plaintiff is
             not entitled to. Plaintiff is also claiming interest on pending
             installments i.e. Rs.26,436.00 which he is not entitled as he
             is also claiming interest on the principal amount in the suit.

<p id="p_6">          5. In view of the above, in my opinion, the plaintiff is entitled to



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">C. S. No. 391/11                                                              3</span>
                                     Kotak Mahindra Bank Vs. Rajender Singh

             recovery of Rs.3,49,124.93 (3,94,603.84 -(19,022.91 +
             26,436.00) = 3,49,124.93). The plaintiff has also prayed for
             pendentalite and future interest @ 13.42% per annum on
             the outstanding amount which is also mentioned in the
             application form. Keeping in view all these facts, in my
             opinion, interest at the rate of 13.42% per annum will be
             very much on the higher side. Interest at the rate of 8% per
             annum will be sufficient. The suit of the plaintiff is, thus,
             decreed for Rs.3,49,124.93 with 8% interest per annum on
             the outstanding amount from the date of institution of the
             suit till realization with cost.   Decree sheet be prepared
             accordingly.    File be consigned to Record Room after due
             compliance.
