                           JUDGMENT
</pre>

<p id="p_1">Manjula Chellur,CJ

      Petitioner has approached this Court seeking police

protection against respondents 4 to 11 not only to her but also

her family members. She has two sons who are married and all

of them are residing in the same house which belongs to

petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_2">      2.  1st son of petitioner was conducting money lending

business, which was closed two years back, but respondents 4 to

11 are trespassing into the house of the petitioner along with

other men everyday, even at odd hours compelling petitioner to

see that her son pays the amount with interest; otherwise she

has to leave the property.
</p>
<p id="p_3">      3. The allegations made in the writ petition indicate, a civil

dispute with respect to recovery of money is pending between

her son and third parties. If certain amount is due by her son to

third parties, there is no law which prevents such persons

W.P.(C) No.15216 of 2014
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                 2</span>



approaching the debtor to repay the money. If she was not a

surety for such payments, we fail to understand why she is

shying about the visits of such persons. If visits of respondents 4

to 11 amounts to any crime or leads to any law and order

problem, then alone police have to intervene and do the needful.

Under the guise of police protection, petitioner cannot avoid

creditors, who have to receive money from her son, visiting the

house as her son along with his family is residing very much in

the same house where she is residing. If she has any civil right

to prevent anyone entering the house unlawfully, she is at liberty

to take such recourse before civil court.

</p><p id="p_4">      With these observations, this writ petition is closed.

However, respondent police shall enquire into the matter and do

the needful, without intervening in the money transaction

between son of the petitioner and respondents 4 to 11.
