<pre id="pre_1"> THE HONOURABLE SRI JUSTICE M.S.RAMACHANDRA RAO


      CIVIL REVISION PETITION Nos.3628 and 3635 of 2018


COMMON ORDER :

      These two Revisions arise between the same parties out of the

same suit and so they are being disposed of by this common order.


2.    Petitioners in both these Revisions are defendants in the suit

O.S.No.1078 of 2008 filed by respondent against them for specific</pre>

<p id="p_1">performance, recovery of amounts etc., alleging that petitioners were

tenants of the respondent and after completion of the original period

of lease, they had agreed to allegedly extend the lease.


</p><p id="p_2">3.    Thereafter written statement was filed opposing the suit claim

and trial also concluded. However, the matter was reopened after

hearing of arguments for certain reasons.


</p><p id="p_3">4.    Thereafter the respondent filed I.A.Nos.58 of 2016 and 247 of

2016 seeking amendment of the plaint and these applications were

ordered on 01-02-2016 and 05-06-2017.
</p>
<p id="p_4">
</p><p id="p_5">5.    Later amended written statements were filed by petitioners

opposing the pleas in the amended plaint and also the reliefs added by

way of amendment.
</p>
<p id="p_6">
</p><p id="p_7">6.    Thereafter petitioners filed I.A.No.2900 of 2017 invoking Order

VIII Rule 1(A) C.P.C. to receive certain documents and make them
                                   2                            MSR,J
                                                           C.R.P.Nos.3628 and
                                                                 3635 of 2018




part of record and I.A.No.2899 of 2017 to reopen the evidence of

petitioners.
</p>
<p id="p_8">
</p><p id="p_9">7.    It is the contention of the petitioners that petitioners were the

successors to M/s.Satyam Computer Services Limited and after 2009,

there was turmoil in the management of the said Company and

investigation by various Agencies and the documents in question

could not be filed at the time when the additional written statements

were filed. It is contended that these documents have to be placed on

record in view of the subsequent pleadings.


</p><p id="p_10">8.    Counter-affidavit was filed by respondent opposing these

applications contending that the documents sought to be filed are not

relevant and that the alleged turmoil in the management of

M/s.Satyam Computer Services Limited was not relevant ground for

inability to produce these documents along with additional written

statements.
</p>
<p id="p_11">
</p><p id="p_12">9.    By separate orders dt.20-03-2018 these two applications were

dismissed by the Court below observing that the turmoil in the

management is not a ground for not producing the documents at the

relevant point of time and the petitioners did not explain how

additional documents sought to be marked would prove their defence

about the prayers added through amendment to the plaint being barred

by limitation.
</p>
<p id="p_13">
</p><p id="p_14">10.   Assailing the same, these two Revisions are filed.
</p><pre id="pre_2">                                      3                       MSR,J
                                                         C.R.P.Nos.3628 and
                                                               3635 of 2018




11.   Heard both sides.


</pre><p id="p_15">12.   It is an admitted fact that after 2009, there was criminal

investigation against M/s.Satyam Computer Services Limited and the

petitioners had taken over Management of the said Company

thereafter and they stepped into the shoes of the said Company. When

for the purpose of investigation, records of M/s.Satyam Computer

Services Limited had been seized by the police and other Agencies,

petitioners, who are successors of the said Company, cannot be

blamed for not producing the subject documents along with additional

written statements.
</p>
<p id="p_16">
</p><p id="p_17">13.   Also, the view of the Court below that petitioners have failed to

explain how those documents are relevant, also cannot be sustained

because while receiving documents, the issues of relevancy and

admissibility cannot be gone into.
</p>
<p id="p_18">
</p><p id="p_19">14.   Therefore, the impugned orders are set aside and I.A.Nos.2899

of 2017 and 2900 of 2017 are both allowed.
</p>
<p id="p_20">
</p><p id="p_21">15.   These two Civil Revision Petitions are allowed accordingly.

No costs.
</p>
<p id="p_22">
</p><p id="p_23">16.   As a sequel, the miscellaneous petitions, if any pending, shall

stand closed.
</p>
