13.06.2016
        Shri   Sushil      Goswami,     counsel      for   the
applicants.
        Shri Mohd. Irshad, Panel Lawyer, for the
respondent/State.</pre>
<p id="p_1">        Heard the learned counsel for the parties.
        The applicants have an apprehension of
their      arrest     in     connection       with     Crime
No.158/2016 registered at Police Station Sironj,
District Vidisha (M.P.) for the offences punishable
under <a href="/doc/538436/" id="a_1">Sections 498A</a>, <a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_2">34</a> of IPC and under
<a href="/doc/751411/" id="a_3">Section 3</a>/<a href="/doc/1023340/" id="a_4">4</a> of the Dowry Prohibition Act.
</p><p id="p_2">        Learned counsel for the applicants submits
that the applicants are the reputed citizens of the
locality who have no criminal past alleged
against them. The complainant is the daughter-
in-law of the applicants No.1 and 2 and the
sister-in-law of applicant No.3. Applicants No.1
and 3 are the government servants and if they
are arrested then they may lose their jobs. The
complainant had left the house of the applicants
long back and therefore her husband lodged a
petition of divorce before the concerned court on
07.07.2015. Thereafter, as a counterblast, the
complainant lodged the FIR. No alleged offence
is made out against the applicants. In the
alternate, the offences are triable by the Court of
Magistrate and nothing is to be recovered from

the applicants. If they are arrested then the
possibility of future compromise will go away.
Under these circumstances, the applicants pray
for bail of anticipatory nature.
</p><p id="p_3">     Learned      Panel      Lawyer       opposes       the
application.
</p><p id="p_4">     Keeping in view the submissions made by
learned counsel for the parties and looking to the
facts and circumstances of the case, without
expressing any opinion on the merits of the case,
I am of the view that the applicants have a good
case for grant of bail of anticipatory nature.
Consequently,     the   present     application     under
<a href="/doc/1783708/" id="a_5">Section 438</a> of Cr.P.C. is hereby allowed.
</p><p id="p_5">     It is directed that in the event of arrest, the
present applicants namely Murarilal Panthi,
Smt. Kalpana Panthi and Mahendra Panthi
be released on bail on their furnishing a personal
bond in the sum of Rs.25,000/- (Rupees Twenty
Five Thousand only) each with one solvent
surety each of the like amount to the satisfaction
of the Arresting Authority (Investigation Officer).
</p><p id="p_6">     The    applicants      shall   make      themselves
available for interrogation by a police officer as
and when required. They shall further abide by
the other conditions enumerated in sub-Section
(2) of <a href="/doc/1783708/" id="a_6">Section 438</a> of Cr.P.C.
</p><p id="p_7">     This order shall remain in force for a period

     of 60 days and in the meanwhile, if the applicants
     so desire, may move an application for regular
     bail before the competent Court.
</p><p id="p_8">          Bail under <a href="/doc/1783708/" id="a_7">Section 438</a> of the Cr.P.C. is given
     for a limited period so that the evidence received
     against     the      applicants         during     further
     investigation     may     be    considered       by     the
     concerned     Court,    who     shall    consider     their
     application under <a href="/doc/1763444/" id="a_8">Sections 437</a> or 439 of the
     <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_9">Cr.P.C</a>.
