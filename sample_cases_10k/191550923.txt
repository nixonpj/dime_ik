upon the judgment of this Court in the case of <a href="/doc/1058275/" id="a_4">Risal Singh v. Union of

India</a> (2010) 321 ITR 252 (P&amp;H) and also Bikramjit Sood v. State of

                        Ram Gopal Verma Patwari, states that the entire

                        amount of T.D.S deducted has been received

                        back from the Income Tax Department; amount of

                        TDS, which was deducted earlier, received from

                        the Income Tax Department, shall be disbursed to

                        the petitioner(s) in accordance with law positively

                        within six weeks from today.</blockquote><p id="p_7">

                           revived after six weeks, if orders are not complied

                           with."
</p>
<p id="p_10">               It is a matter of record that in compliance of the aforesaid

order,   a sum of Rs.1,53,85,459/-          was returned to the claimants on

20.10.2011. However, the remaining amount was kept by the Income Tax

Authorities.
</p>
<p id="p_11">               Thereafter, the petitioner moved the civil misc. application for

revival of the contempt petition         alleging that the entire    amount as

deducted by the LAC and ordered by this Court on 23.8.2011 was not

refunded to her.
</p>
<p id="p_12">               Keeping in view the stand taken by the parties, this Court

passed the order dated 8.2.2013 whereby amount of Rs.3,18,70,577/-

which was refunded by the Income Tax Department to the Land Acquisition

Collector was ordered to be paid to the Income Tax Department as well as

the petitioners in equal shares as it is not disputed by the Income Tax

Authorities before this Court that the TDS could have been deducted only

@ 10% and not @ 20%.
</p>
<p id="p_13">               Mr. Ashok Jindal, Additional Advocate General, Haryana, has

informed this Court that the aforesaid amount has been disbursed to the

petitioner as well as Income Tax Authorities as per the order dated

8.2.2013.
</p>
<p id="p_14">               Thus, there is no controversy with regard to the fact that now

the entire amount as deducted on account of TDS stands adjusted/

appropriated and a sum of Rs.1,59,35,289/- has remained with the Income

Tax Authorities as TDS @ 10% as the interest component on the enhanced
 CM No.2022-CII of 2012 in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">COCP No.1498 of 2011                                 4</span>

compensation.
</p>
<p id="p_15">             At this stage, it may further be noticed that Mr. Ashok Jindal,

Additional Advocate General, Haryana, has informed this Court that the

revised TDS certificates have been issued to the petitioner. Thus, the

petitioner is at liberty to seek refund    of the aforesaid amount and to file

revised returns and matching adjustments of the aforesaid amount as per

law from the Income Tax Authorities.
</p>
<p id="p_16">              However, it may also be noticed at this stage that the amount

of TDS as deducted on 13.8.2010 and which was over and above the

amount of Rs.1,59,35,289/- has remained either with the Income Tax

Authorities or with the Land Acquisition Officer. The petitioner is claiming

that she is entitled to the interest whereas the respondents have denied

their liability to pay any interest for the aforesaid period.

</p><p id="p_17">             Be that as it may, this petition is disposed of with a direction to

the LAO to decide the question of interest payable to the petitioner, for the

aforesaid period for which she was denied the said amount, within a period

of three months from the date of receipt of certified copy of this order. The

LAO shall also decide the question of rate of interest as well as the liability

to pay either of the respondents, if any, payable to the petitioner.

</p><p id="p_18">             The parties shall be at liberty to challenge such order of the

LAO in accordance with law.
