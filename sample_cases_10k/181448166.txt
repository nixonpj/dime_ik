               of son of the defendants namely Sh. Jitender Chauhan and her

               over the possession of two rooms of ground floor and first floor

               measuring 75 sq. yds. to the plaintiff.                                                                     According to the

               plaintiff, since then she is in possession of the suit property and

               she has contributed towards cost of construction of the

               aforesaid portion both before her marriage and after her

               marriage. However, according to her, defendants have been

               harassing the plaintiff on one pretext or the other and are trying

               to forcibly dispossess her from the suit property.                                                                                  Besides,

               according to her, the defendants are adamant on disconnecting

               the electricity as well as the water supply to the portion of the

               plaintiff. Therefore, the plaintiff has filed the present suit for

               permanent injunction seeking decree in her favour and against

               the plaintiff.

<p id="p_5">       3. Defendants filed their written statement and denied that the

               plaintiff is in possession of the suit property since the date of

               her marriage. Though admittedly the plaintiff was married to

               son of the defendants on 17.06.2009, however, according to the

               defendants, the plaintiff left the suit property on 21.08.2009 and

               again made a forcible entry in the suit property on 10.06.2010.

               According to them, the defendants being peace loving citizens

               could not resist the attempt of the plaintiff to enter the suit

               property despite the fact that the defendants are the true owner

               of the suit property and the suit property is their self-acquired

               property. Thus, according to the defendants, the present suit of

               the plaintiff is liable to be dismissed in as much as no suit for

               injunction against true owner is maintainable.                                                                               They have

               further denied in their written statement that the plaintiff had

               ever contributed towards the cost of construction of the suit

               property or that they had ever disconnected the electricity and

               water supply of the plaintiff. According to them, they have

               matrimonial discord between the plaintiff and her husband

               which had made the life of the defendants miserable. According

               to them, since the husband of the plaintiff is not living in the

               suit property alongwith the defendants and the plaintiff, the suit

               property cannot be termed as her matrimonial home and as such

               the plaintiff is not entitled to the injunction prayed for by her.

               framed by Ld. Predecessor of this court vide order dated

               22.03.2011 are as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_34">Issue no. 1: Whether the plaintiff is in settled possession of the suit

                             property? OPP.
</p>
<p id="p_35">       15.It is the case of the plaintiff that she is in settled possession of

               the suit property since the date of her marriage with son of

               defendants. On the other hand, case of the defendant is that the

               plaintiff has left the suit property on 21.08.2009 and has again

               made forcible entry in the suit property on 10.06.2010. Both

               the parties have reiterated the aforesaid stands in their

               respective affidavits, however, no corroborative evidence has

               been led on behalf of any of the parties to prove their respective

               stands. Be that as it may, in the present case, we are concerned

               only with the fact as to whether the plaintiff was in settled

               possession of the suit property as on the date of the filing of the

               present suit by her against the defendants i.e. on 27.01.2011.

               The aforesaid fact regarding the plaintiff being in possession of

                the suit property as on the date of the filing of the suit has not

               been disputed by any of the parties.                                                               Thus in view of the

               aforesaid facts even if the case of the defendant regarding the

               plaintiff having left the suit property on 21.08.2009 and having

               made the forcible entry again on 10.01.2010 is admitted to be

               correct, the plaintiff was in settled possession of the suit

               property as on the date of the filing of the suit. Admittedly she

               continues to be in settled possession of the suit property during

               the pendency of the present suit. Thus,the issue no. 1 is decided

               in favour of the plaintiff and against the defendants.

                become complete prior to the marriage of plaintiff with son of

               the defendants. The plaintiff has examined herself as well as

               PW-2 in support of her aforesaid case. So far as the testimony

               of PW-2 in this regard is concerned, admittedly, the same is a

               piece of hearsay evidence in as much as PW-2 has deposed that

               the aforesaid fact was told by the plaintiff to him and he has

               actually not seen the plaintiff contributing towards the cost of

               construction of the suit property. Even the testimony of the

               plaintiff regarding her contribution towards the cost of

               construction of the suit property seems to be not believable in

               as much as it has been alleged by her that she has contributed

               towards the cost of construction of the suit property even prior

               to her marriage with the son of the defendants. It has nowhere

               been disclosed by the plaintiff either in her plaint or in her

               replication or in her affidavit by way of evidence or during her

               cross-examination as to what amount has been given by her to

               the defendants for construction of the suit property and at what

               point of time the same was so given. In the absence of any

               pleadings or deposition on the part of the plaintiff regarding the

               plaintiff being known to son of the defendants prior to

               contributed towards the cost of construction of the suit property.

               The evidence led by the plaintiff on the aforesaid aspect falls

               short of discharging the onus of the plaintiff to prove that she

               has contributed towards the cost of construction of the suit

               property. Even if, it is admitted for the sake of arguments that

               the plaintiff has contributed towards the cost of construction of

               the suit property, the same, in my considered opinion, does not

               confer any ownership rights upon the plaintiff in view of the

               fact that admittedly the defendants are the owner of the suit

               property.

               right, title or interest in the suit property, however, in view of

               the fact that she is in settled possession of the suit property, her

               possession needs to be protected against any forcible

               dispossession by the defendants by passing a decree of

               permanent injunction restraining the defendants from forcibly

               possession from any unlawful interference even by true owner.

</p><p id="p_43">       18. On the other hand, it is submitted by the counsel for defendants

               that the plaintiff is not entitled to the aforesaid decree in as

               much as admittedly the defendants are the owner of the suit

               property and plaintiff has got no right, title or interest in the

               same. It is submitted by him that it is settled legal position that

               the suit for injunction does not lie against the true owner. Even

               otherwise, according to him, the suit of the plaintiff has become

               infructuous in as much as the defendant no. 1 has already filed

               the suit for possession against the plaintiff herein which is

               pending adjudication before this court. There cannot be any

               dispute about the legal proposition that a person in settled

               possession of a property cannot be forcibly dispossessed by

               even the true owners except by following due process of law.

               of limitation. However, it does not mean that a tresspasser in

               settled possession can file a suit for injunction against the true

               owner for protection of his possession. The suit for injunction

               shall be governed by legal principles laid down by several

               courts in this regard such as the injunction being an equitable

               relief the plaintiff seeking injunction must approach the court

               with clean hands.

<p id="p_46">       20. It has been held by Hon'ble Supreme Court in Mal Adeo

               Savlaram Shalke Vs. Pune Municipal Corporation 1995 (3)

               SCC 33 that it is settled law that no injunction could be granted

               against the owner at the instance of a person in unlawful

               possession. Thus, in view of the fact that injunction is an

               equitable relief, the court before granting the same must see

               whether a person who is a tresspasser can seek the helping hand

               of the court for protecting his unlawful possession as against

               the owner. The person who seeks equity must do equity and he

               must also come to the court with clean hands. When he do

               these things, there will be no occasion for him to seek an

               injunction in as much as the tress passer would have

               cannot at the same time ask for the helping hand of the court to

               protect his legal possession.
</p>
<p id="p_48">       21. Therefore, in view of the aforesaid discussion, it is one thing to

               say that a tresspasser forcibly ousted from possession of a

               property can seek restoration of possession under <a href="/doc/1773715/" id="a_3">Section 6</a> of

               the Specific Relief Act and it is altogether different thing to

               suggest that the tresspasser can seek injunction against the true

               owner restraining him from dispossessing the tresspasser.

               While the former course of action is available to the tress

               passer, the later relief is not available to a person in unlawful

               occupation of the property. While taking the aforesaid view, I

                         expiry thereof and express request of the owners to
                         vacate, seek the helping hand of the Court for a

                         process of law, he is entitled for an injunction?

</p><p id="p_52">                         10. In our opinion, there are two different sets of principles
                         which have to be borne in mind. Taking up the first aspect,
                         it is true that where a person is in settled possession of
                         property, even on the assumption that he has no right to
                         remain in property, he cannot be dispossessed by the owner
                         except by recourse to law. This principle is laid down in
                         <a href="/doc/1773715/" id="a_4">Section 6</a> of the Specific Relief Act, 1963. That Section
                         says that if any person is dispossessed without his consent
                         from immovable property otherwise than in due course of
                         law, he or any person claiming through him may, by suit,
                         recover possession thereof, notwithstanding any other title
                         that may be set up in such suit. That a person without title
                         but in "settled" possession _ as against mere fugitive
                         possession _ can get back possession if forcibly dispossed
                         or         rather,              if       dispossed                    otherwise than                               by          due
                         process of law, has been laid down in several cases. It was

<p id="p_54">                         13. We shall now refer to the other aspect of the matter.
                         Assuming a trespasser ousted can seek restoration of
                         possession under <a href="/doc/1773715/" id="a_9">Section 6</a> of the Specific Relief Act, can
                         the trespasser seek injunction against the true owner? In
                         our view this question does not entirely depend upon
                         <a href="/doc/1773715/" id="a_10">Section 6</a> of the Specific Relief Act but mainly depends
                         upon certain general principles applicable to the law of
                         injunctions and as to the scope of the exercise of
                         discretion while granting injunctions? Recently, the law
                         in this behalf has been clarified by the Supreme Court in

                         and in our view, must be deemed to be wrongly decided.
                         The approach in the latter group of cases to the question of
                         grant of injunction was from the angle of <a href="/doc/1773715/" id="a_25">Section 6</a> of

                          unlawful possession as against the owner. A person who
                         seeks equity must do equity. He must also come to Court
                         with clean hands. When he does these things there will be
                         no occasion for him to seek an injunction inasmuch as
                         the trespass would have automatically stood vacated. If
                         he does not do these things, he cannot at the same time
                         ask for the helping hand of the Court to protect his illegal
                         possession.
</p>
<p id="p_67">                         It is argued for the appellant that this may be anamolous. It
                         is said that the trespasser has a "right" to an injunction
                         against the true owner, and this is complementary to the
                         duty of the owner not to evict the trespasser outside the
                         judicial process. In our view, there is no anomaly. Each of
                         these is based on a different legal principle. If the plaintiff
                         wants the defendant to act in accordance with law he
                         must first abide by the law himself and vacate the
                         property as one would expect a law abiding citizen to

                Cook's case (supra) wherein the court has further observed as

               follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">                         "27. This brings me to the second aspect of 'due process
                         of law'. It was urged by Mr Kaul that even if the plaintiff
                         was in unlawful possession it could only be evicted by due
                         process of law and therefore the plaintiff was entitled to
                         an order of injunction preventing the defendants from
                         removing the plaintiff from the said two rooms except
                         through due process of law. It must be made clear that this
                         argument fails in the context of this case because the
                         plaintiff was never in possession and therefore there is no
                         question of dispossession in the sense usually understood.
                         The plaintiff had a mere right to use, such right was
                         revocable, it has been revoked and the plaintiff is entitled
                         under <a href="/doc/118103223/" id="a_26">section 63</a> of the Indian Easements Act, 1882 to a
                         reasonable time to leave the premises and take away its
                         goods. The argument also fails because by rushing to
                         court the plaintiff has indeed invited a judicial
                         determination of its status. If it got an order of injunction

                         be heard to say that this court has to grant an injunction
                         all the same because otherwise it would give a licence to
                         the defendants to forcibly throw out the plaintiff without

                "due process of law" in para no. 28 of the aforesaid judgment

               which has been used by the Supreme Court in innumerable

               judgments which have been cited by Ld. Predecessor of this

               court while disposing of the application for ad-interim

               injunction. The aforesaid para is reproduced herein below for

               ready reference:

<blockquote id="blockquote_3">                      "28. The expressions 'due process of law', 'due course of
                      law' and 'recourse to law' have been interchangeably used in
                      the decisions referred to above which say that the settled
                      possession of even a person in unlawful possession cannot
                      be disturbed 'forcibly' by the true owner taking law in his
                      own hands. All these expressions; however, mean the same
                      thing--ejectment from settled possession can only be had by
                      recourse to a court of law. Clearly, 'due process of law' or
                      'due course of law', here, simply mean that a person in
                      settled possession cannot be ejected without a court of law
                      having adjudicated upon his rights qua the true owner.</blockquote><p id="p_72">


</p><p id="p_73">                      Now, this 'due process process' or 'due course' condition is
                      satisfied the moment the rights of the parties are
                      adjudicated upon by a court of competent jurisdiction. It
                      does not matter who brought the action to court. It could be
                      the owner in an action for enforcement of his right to eject
                      the person in unlawful possession. It could be the person
                      who is sought to be ejected, in an action preventing the
                      owner from ejecting him. Whether the action is for
                      enforcement of a right (recovery of possession) or protection
                      of a right (injunction against dispossession), is not of much
                      consequence. What is important is that in either event it is an
                      action before the court and the court adjudicates upon it. If
                      that is done then, the 'bare minimum' requirement of 'due
                      process' or 'due course' of law would stand satisfied as
                      recourse to law would have been taken. In this context,

                       when a party approaches a court seeking a protective
                      remedy such as an injunction and it fails in setting up a
                      good case, can it then say that the other party must now
                      institute an action in a court of law for enforcing his rights
                      i.e., for taking back something from the first party who
                      holds it unlawfully, and, till such time, the court hearing
                      the injunction action must grant an injunction anyway? I
                      would think not. In any event, the 'recourse to law'
                      stipulation stands satisfied when a judicial determination
                      is made with regard to the first party's protective action.
                      Thus, in the present case, the plaintiff's failure to make out a
                      case for an injunction does not mean that its consequent
                      cessation of user of the said two rooms would have been
                      brought about without recourse to law." (Emphasis mine)

               the judgment of the Hon'ble Delhi High Court, it has been held

               by Hon'ble Apex Court as follows:

<blockquote id="blockquote_4">                      "79. Due process of law means that nobody ought to be
                      condemned unheard. The due process of law means a
                      person in settled possession will not be dispossessed
                      except by due process of law. Due process means an
                      opportunity to the defendant to file pleadings including
                      written statement and documents before the court of
                      law. It does not mean the whole trial. Due process of
                      law is satisfied the moment rights of the parties are
                      adjudicated upon by a competent court."

               Issue no. 2 and as such Issue no. 2 is decided against the

               plaintiff and in favour of the defendants.

Issue no. 3 : Whether the plaintiff is entitled to permanent

               though the plaintiff has been able to prove her past possession

               of the suit property, however, she has failed to prove that she is

               entitled to continue in possession of the suit property. Since the

               plaintiff is not entitled to continue in possession of the suit

               property, in my considered opinion, she has failed to discharge

               the onus even for grant of reliefs which are subject matter of

               dismissed with cost in favour of the defendants which are

               quantified at Rs. 20,000/- since the only purpose of filing of the

               present suit by the plaintiff seems to be to harrass the
