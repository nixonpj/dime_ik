HIGH COURT OF JUDICATURE AT ALLAHABAD
 
 

Case :- FIRST APPEAL FROM ORDER No. - 895 of 1998
 
Appellant :- Baldeo
 
Respondent :- Moti Lal And Others
 
Counsel for Appellant :- V.C. Dixit
 
Counsel for Respondent :- N.K. Srivastava
 

 
Hon'ble Dr. Kaushal Jayendra Thaker,J.
</pre> 
<p id="p_1">1.	Heard Sri S.D. Ojha, learned counsel for the appellant and Sri N.K. Srivastava, learned counsel for the respondent and the perused the judgment and order impugned.
</p> 
<p id="p_2">2.	This appeal, at the behest of the claimant, challenges the judgment and award dated 19.5.1998 passed by Motor Accident Claims Tribunal/Special Judge, Azamgarh (hereinafter referred to as 'Tribunal') in M.A.C. Case No. 148 of 1997 awarding a sum of Rs.67,200/- with interest at the rate of 12% as compensation to the claimants. 
</p> 
<p id="p_3">3.	The accident is not in dispute. The issue of negligence decided by the Tribunal is not in dispute. The Insurance Company has not challenged the liability imposed on them. The only issue to be decided is, the quantum. 
</p> 
<p id="p_4">4.	It is submitted by learned counsel for the appellant that the Tribunal has not granted any amount towards future loss of income the deceased which is required to be granted in view of the decision in National Insurance Company Limited Vs. Pranay Sethi and Others, 2017 0 Supreme (SC) 1050. It is further submitted that the multiplier, the amount under non-pecuniary heads awarded by the Tribunal are on the lower side and require enhancement. 
</p> 
<p id="p_5">5.	As against this, learned counsel for the respondent states that the quantum which is awarded by the Tribunal is just and proper and does not call for any interference rather the Tribunal has awarded interest at the rate of 12% which is unjust.  
</p> 
<p id="p_6">6.	After perusing the record, this Court finds that the Tribunal has considered the income of the deceased to be Rs.2200/- per month namely Rs.26,400/- per year and to which as the deceased was below 40 years of age, 40% of the income i.e. Rs. 10,560/- requires to be added as future income of the deceased in view of the decision in Pranay Sethi (Supra) which would bring the annual figure to Rs.26,400 + 10,560 = 36,960/- which after deduction of 1/3rd comes to Rs.24,640/-. As the deceased was 30 years of age, the applicable multiplier would be 17 in view of the decision of the Apex Court in Sarla Verma Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation, (2009) 6 SCC 121. In addition to that, Rs.40,000/- is granted under the head of non-pecuniary damages in view of the decision in Pranay Sethi (Supra). Hence, the total would be Rs.24, 640 x 17 + 40,000 = 4,58,880/- of which 25% would be Rs.1,04,720/- is the total compensation available to the claimant. 
</p> 
<p id="p_7">7.	The rate of interest will have to be 9% in view of the judgment of the Division Bench of Lucknow Bench in F.A.F.O. No. 199 of 2017 (National Insurance Company Limited Vs. Lavkush and another) decided on 21.3.2017 which has been followed by this Court time and again and which will enure for the benefit of the respondent. 
</p> 
<p id="p_8">8.	No other grounds are urged orally when the matter was heard.  
</p> 
<p id="p_9">9.	In view of the above, the appeal is partly allowed. Judgment and decree passed by the Tribunal shall stand modified to the aforesaid extent. The difference in amount be deposited with interest at the rate of 9% from the date of filing of the claim petition till award and 6% thereafter till the amount is deposited. The amount be deposited within a period of 12 weeks from today. 
</p> 
<p id="p_10">Order Date :- 18.11.2019
