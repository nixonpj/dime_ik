    and  28(1)  of  1981  Rules  and granted them  one  year  salary in  lieu  of back

    provisions of  Maharashtra Employees of private Schools (conditions of service) 

    Act,1977  (herein after referred to as "the 1977 Act" for short) and  the 1981

    employees in  day school to work in  night school also and here, there is no 





    dispute about this position. The Education Officer also recognized this position 

    and granted approval to both the Teachers. Headmaster in regular school can 

    become   Headmaster   in   night   school   and   is   entitled   to   receive   ½   of   basic 

    prescribed for regular Headmaster. About  the other staff or Assistant Teacher,

    the  1977  Act read with  the  1981 Rules  to demonstrate  that  said  provisions

    employees. Part time recognition is due to availability of such work load but 

    then that is not temporary work as understood in the 1977 Act or the 1981 




                                                                
    Rules. They equally enjoy the security of service and no discrimination on that 

    count   is   possible.   According   to   him,   merely   because   both   teachers   were 




                                                   
    working   in   day   school   as   regular   employees,   the   denial   of   back   wages   is 
                                 
    arbitrary.   In   any   case,   according   to   him   grant   of   salary   of   one   year   as 

    compensation therefor is unsustainable. He also points out that Mrs. Sudha was 
                                
    not  working in any day school and finding in this connection recorded by the 

    School Tribunal are perverse. Denial of back wages is thus based on erroneous 
           


    belief.   He   has   relied   upon   the   unreported   judgment   dated   1/10/2010   by

    ground that the 1977 Act and the 1981 Rules do not apply to Night School,

    by  a  "Private   School"  is   also satisfied  in  this   matter.  The   Employer   has not

    defined   in   Chapter   I   of   Secondary   Schools   Code   and   has   due   recognition 

    thereunder. Rule 2(l) of 1981 Rules also expressly defines "Night School" on 





    same lines with minor changes not relevant here.  Clause(i) of proviso to Rule 

    3(1) (b) of 1981 Rules stipulates that a person to be appointed as Headmaster 





    of night school shall not be the Head or Assistant Head of a School. In other 

    words  an  Assistant   Teacher  in  a  day  school   is  eligible  for    consideration  as 

    Headmaster of a night school. Rule 7(i) of 1981 Rules while stating that pay 

    scales of school employees shall be as given in Schedule "C" also covers night 

    schools within its fold. Similarly, in Schedule C in part VII, it prescribes pay

    vs.   S.D.   Sharma   and   Others</a>  (supra)   relied   upon   by   the   Employer   needs 




                                                                                          
    consideration here. The record there showed that  there were thirty vacancies 




                                                                  
    in   permanent   posts   and   thirty-one   vacancies   in   temporary   additional   posts. 
</p>
<p id="p_18">    These   thirty-one   posts   were   created   initially   for   a   period   of   one   year   but 




                                                                 
    renewed  from  year  to year  from   1960  onwards  and have  been  in  existence 

    continuously   since   then.     These   temporary   additional   posts   were,   therefore, 




                                                   
    held not fortuitous posts created for the purpose of special tasks but formed an 
                                  
    integral part of the regular cadre, and appointments to those posts were also 

    made from the approved select list of Mamlatdars prepared in consultation with 
                                 
    the Gujarat Public Service Commission.  Rule 9(8) of the Bombay Civil Service 

    Rules, 1959, defines "cadre" as meaning the strength of a service or a part of 
          


    service sanctioned as a separate unit". Hon'ble  Apex Court found the service of 
       



    Deputy Collectors  admittedly a separate unit under the Revenue Department. 
</p>
<p id="p_19">    Cadre consisted of permanent posts and temporary posts added to the cadre 





    from time to time according to the exigencies of the service. The difference 

    between   permanent   and   temporary   posts   was   found   brought   out   by   the 





    definition of these expressions given in Rule 9. Under Rule 9(43), a permanent 

    post is a post carrying a definite rate of pay sanctioned without limit of time 

    and under Rule 9(56) a temporary post is a post carrying a definite rate of pay 

    sanctioned for a limited time. This judgment does not advance the cause of 

    Employer at all.

    Rules to find out what is meant by permanent and temporary.     Rule 10 lays 

    down   categories   of   employees.   It   recognizes   them   as   permanent   and     non-

<p id="p_21">    permanent. Non-permanent employees are stated to be either temporary or on 

    probation.   Its   sub-rule   (2)   states   -   "A   temporary   employee   is   one   who   is 




                                                    
    appointed to a temporary vacancy for a fixed period." Probationer, therefore is 
                                  
    not a temporary employee  in  sense  as required in  law i.e.,  the  1981  Rules. 
</p>
<p id="p_22">    Though appointment of probationer is for fixed period still vacancy occupied by 
                                 
    him is permanent and not a temporary one. Similarly, when a full-time teacher 

    in day school proceeds on long leave, his permanent workload is required to be 
            


    entrusted   to   another   full-time   teacher   during   his   absence.   Thus   though   the 
         



    available     workload   is   full-time,   still   the   vacancy   is   in   leave   period   i.e., 

    temporary vacancy. Appointment as full-time teacher against such temporary 





    vacancy is for fixed period of leave. Such substitute full-timer is therefore not 

    permanent employee but a temporary one under scheme of the 1981 Rules. 
</p>




<p id="p_23">    Thus understood, nature of appointment (either as permanent or temporary) 

    has got no bearing on type of workload available i.e., full-time or part-time.

<p id="p_24">    Classification of workload in night school is essentially due to normal working 

    hours   of   a   day   viz.   regular   school.   It   has   no   co-relation   with   nature   of 

    establishment. Establishment of Night School here is permanent establishment

    time workload for any night school. It is ½ of the average or normal working 

    hours of a regular day schools governed by the 1977 Act and the 1981 Rules.

<p id="p_25">    Only because it functions for half the time as compared to day school, for its 

    regulation   and   service   conditions,   it   is   compared   with   part-time   service. 
</p>



                                                  
<p id="p_26">    Concept of part-time work is applied because  provisions in Rules mostly deal 
                                 
    with full-time work in day school. It can not by itself be relevant in permanent 

    establishment which itself is functioning  for maximum possible hours. There 
                                
    may   be   several   part-time   jobs   available   permanently   in   establishment 

    functioning for full time. It is therefore wrong to  construe such part-time work 
            


    as temporary at least in the face of Rule 10(2) above.

    against   a   temporary   vacancy   but   it   also   has   to   be   for   fixed   duration.   Thus 

    workload needs to be available for temporary period only.   Employer before

    situation  obtaining in each case. It will depend upon several factors, one of 
                                 
    which would be as to whether the recruitment was effected in terms of the 

    statutory provisions operating in the field, if any. It is held that the  tribunals 
                                
    and the courts have to be realistic albeit the ordinary rule of full back wages on 

    reinstatement. Hon'ble Apex Court then examined the factual situation in the 
          


    case   before   it.   The   services   of   the   respondent   were   found   terminated   on 
       



    11.6.1987. The Labour Court gave its award on 27.9.2002 after a gap of more 

    than   15   years.   The   Labour   Court   upon   examination   of   the   entire   issue   had 





    concluded that the respondent would not be entitled to any back wages for the 

    period he did not work. Perusal of its award also revealed  that the respondent 





    did not place on the record of the Labour Court any material or evidence to 

    show that  he  was  not  gainfully employed during  the  long spell  of 15  years 

    when he was out of service of the appellant. Hon'ble  Apex Court noticed that 

    the High Court without examining the factual situation, and placing reliance on 

    the judgment in <a href="/doc/1836139/" id="a_19">Hindustan Tin Works (P) Ltd. v. Employees</a> (supra) held that 




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_29">                                                                 ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 16:37:01 :::</span>

    the normal rule of full back wages ought to be followed in this case. It is held 




                                                                                           
    that  such a conclusion could have been reached by the High Court only after 




                                                                   
    recording cogent reasons in support thereof, especially since the award of the 

    Labour Court was being modified. The Labour Court exercising its discretionary 




                                                                  
    jurisdiction concluded that it was not a fit case for the grant of back wages. 
</p>
<p id="p_33">    Hon. Apex Court pointed out its earlier observations  in  P.V.K. Distillery Ltd. to 




                                                    
    the effect :-- "15. The issue as raised in the matter of back wages has been dealt  
                                  
    with by the Labour Court in the manner as above having regard to the facts and  

    circumstances of the matter in the issue, upon exercise of its discretion and obviously  
                                 
    in a manner which cannot but be judicious in nature. There exists an obligation on  

    the part of the High Court to record in the judgment, the reasoning before however  
            


    denouncing   a   judgment   of   an   inferior   tribunal,   in   the   absence   of   which,   the  
         



    judgment in our view cannot stand the scrutiny of otherwise being reasonable.". 
</p>
<p id="p_34">    Hon'ble  Court then held that  the High Court was unjustified in awarding full 





    back wages. It also opined  that the Labour Court having found the termination 

    to be illegal was unjustified in not granting any back wages at all. Keeping in 





    view the facts and circumstances ,it directed that the employer to pay 50% of 

    the back wages from the date of termination of service till reinstatement.

    of   their     Appeal   memos   and   Writ   Petition   of   Baburao     does   not   show   any 

    specific assertion about absence of source of income or then efforts made to 




                                                     
    secure it. Second employment, though not legally prohibited, can be a relevant 
                                   
    circumstance.  Period from 19/10/1995 till 31/7/2001 is of about 6 years  and 

    thus by getting one years salary, teacher Baburao is indirectly getting amount 
                                  
    equal   to   about   16.6%   of   back   wages.   He   has   not   brought   on   record 

    circumstances   constraining   him   to   work   in   night   school   and   to   show   that 
          


    despite   efforts,   he   could   not   get   other   source   to   augment   his   income.   Bald 
       



    assertion in paragraph 23 of his Writ Petition is as his termination was held 

    illegal, School Tribunal ought to have given him full back wages. Hon'ble  Apex 





    Court in  <a href="/doc/1227571/" id="a_20">Reetu Marbles v. Prabhakant Shukla</a>  in labour matter granted 50% 

    back wages in absence of any material by workman to sustain his claim to back 





    wages.   Here,   there   is   absence   of   such   material   and   that   too   not   by   a   poor 

    labour but by a teacher who already had full time regular job. It can not be said 

    that School Tribunal has committed any jurisdictional  error as it has looked 

    into relevant facts and then reached its conclusion. There is nothing here to 

    enable this Court to interfere as far as this aspect is considered.  I therefore do

    when she reported. Headmaster then wrote to her to join on 5/7/2000 and 

    again she was not permitted to join. School Tribunal directed the Education 





    Officer to absorb her, but that direction was not implemented. School Tribunal 

    had by separate judgments delivered on 9/2/2009 partly allowed both these
