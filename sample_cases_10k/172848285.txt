                                                      ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">                           This Criminal Original Petition has been filed challenging the

                 proceedings initiated by the first respondent under Section 113 of Cr.P.C.



</p><p id="p_2">                          2. The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that before

                 invoking <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_2">Section 113</a> of Cr.P.C., the first respondent ought to have

                 followed the procedure under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_3">Section 110</a> of Cr.P.C. by issuing a show

                 cause notice and thereafter, an enquiry has to be conducted. The learned

                 counsel submitted that the show cause notice as contemplated under

                 <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_4">Section 110</a> of Cr.P.C. should be issued only after the concerned Authority

                 records satisfaction and the likelihood of breach of peace. These

                 mandatory requirements have not been followed in this case and

                 therefore, the same requires interference of this Court.



</p><p id="p_3">                          3. The first respondent has filed a counter in this case and it is

                 stated that there are already three cases pending against the petitioner

                 and the petitioner has continued to involve in committing offense and

                 therefore, notice was given to the petitioner to execute a personal bond

                 for good behaviour.
</p>
<p id="p_4">

</p><p id="p_5">                          4. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner as well as the

                 learned     Additional   Public   Prosecutor   appearing   on   behalf   of   the

                 respondent.
</p><p id="p_6">http://www.judis.nic.in
                                                                    Crl.O.P.(MD) No.11306 of 2017

</p><p id="p_7">                          5. The first respondent had invoked <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_5">Section 113</a> of Cr.P.C. since the

                 petitioner did not appear after the summons was issued to him.



</p><p id="p_8">                          6. The first respondent who wants to initiate proceedings, will have

                 to issue a show cause notice under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_6">Section 110</a> of Cr.P.C. to the accused

                 person calling upon him to explain as to why he cannot be ordered to

                 execute a bond for good behavior. Any such Executive Magistrate acting

                 under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_7">Section 110</a> of Cr.P.C shall make an order in writing setting forth

                 the substance of the information received. In other words, before issuing

                 summons under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_8">Section 110</a> of Cr.P.C, there should be some material to

                 show that the Executive Magistrate has applied its mind and he has not

                 mechanically issued summons based on the police report. If on issuance

                 of summons, the accused person fails to appear before the Executive

                 Magistrate then, a summons or warrant can be issued under Section 113

                 of Cr.P.C.
</p>
<p id="p_9">

</p><p id="p_10">                          7. In the present case, the first respondent has taken a stand that

                 the petitioners did not appear before the Executive Magistrate on the date

                 of hearing since he was having the Court hearing before the learned

                 Additional District and Sessions Judge, Ramanathapuram in S.C.No.131 of

                 2017. Therefore, the petitioner had a valid reason for not appearing on

                 the date on which the hearing was fixed.
