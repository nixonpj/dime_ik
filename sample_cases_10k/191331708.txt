(SRI.RAGHAVENDRA G.GAYATHRI, HCGP FOR R1 TO R3
 SRI.SRINIVAS &amp; BADRI ASSTS., ADVS. FOR R4
 SRI.Y.S.H.REDDY, ADV. FOR R5)
                              ---

      This writ petition is filed under Articles 226 and 227 of
the Constitution of India praying to issue a writ in the nature
of certiorari quashing the selection list dated 27.6.2011
published by the 4th respondent vide Ann-B and etc.

     This Petition coming on for Preliminary Hearing in 'B'
Group this day, the Court made the following:-

                          ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">     Petitioner has called in question the order of selection

of 5th respondent dated 27.6.2011 produced at Annexure-B.

However, Annexure-B is only with regard to the marks

obtained by the candidates during the interview and the

selection order of the 5th respondent is at Annexure-A which

is dated 27.6.2011.
</p>
<p id="p_2">

</p><p id="p_3">     2. The case of the petitioner is that, only the marks

obtained in the degree examination and in the Bachelor of

Physical   Education    should      have   been   taken    into

consideration as the basis for selection to the post of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                 3</span>

'Physical Instructor'. He also contended that highest marks

have been awarded to the 5 th respondent in the interview

and it is nothing but nepotism.
</p>
<p id="p_4">

</p><p id="p_5">       3. Annexure-B, the performance of the candidates in

the interview reveals that the petitioner had secured 42.33%

marks in degree examination and 71.08% in the physical

education degree, as against 40.85% and 54.91%, secured

by the 5th respondent. However, in the viva, petitioner was

awarded only 3 marks whereas the 5 th respondent was

awarded 15 marks. The overall percentage of marks secured

at the end of the interview was 59.7% by the petitioner and

62.88% by the 5th respondent.
</p>
<p id="p_6">
</p><p id="p_7">       4. Learned counsel for the petitioner also submits that

though the petitioner was better qualified, highest marks has

been awarded to the 5th respondent in the viva only to favour

him.
</p>
<p id="p_8">
</p><p id="p_9">       5. Learned counsel for the 4 th respondent submitted

that the post for which the interview is conducted is in

respect of the Physical Instructor and apart from the

education     qualification,   the   physical   fitness,   other
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                    4</span>

circumstances were also paramount important which is

required to be considered and only on the basis of the

performance in the interview, marks are allotted. There is no

favouritism as alleged by the petitioner.           Though the

petitioner has made an allegation that the grandfather of the

5th respondent was a Member of the Committee, however,

learned counsel for the 5th respondent submitted that the

grandfather of the 5th respondent expired in the year 1991

much before even the applications were called for. Hence,

that ground is misconceived.
</p>
<p id="p_10">
</p><p id="p_11">      6. It is not in dispute that the 5 th respondent has

secured highest marks in the overall performance than the

petitioner and there is no such other ground raised by the

petitioner to show that the selection of the 5 th respondent

made by the Committee is otherwise bad in law. Considering

the circumstances and also the performance of candidates in

the   interview   as   well   as   the   marks   secured   in   the

examinations, I find that, the interview Committee being the

competent and expert committee, this Court cannot interfere

with the assessment made by it in the interview of the

candidates.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                               5</span><p id="p_12">


</p><p id="p_13">     7. Considering the above circumstances, I find no good

ground to interfere with the impugned notification.

</p><p id="p_14">     Accordingly, petition is dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_15">

</p><p id="p_16">                                       Sd/-
</p><p id="p_17">                                      JUDGE
