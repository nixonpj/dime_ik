                 ORAL ORDER</pre>

<p id="p_1">3   10-07-2018                Heard learned counsel for the petitioner, learned

                 counsel for the Informant as well as learned APP for the State.

</p><p id="p_2">                              The petitioner is in custody in connection with Saharsa

                 Sadar P.S.Case No.576 of 2016 registered for an offence under

                 <a href="/doc/988620/" id="a_1">Sections 406</a>, <a href="/doc/1436241/" id="a_2">420</a>, <a href="/doc/1985627/" id="a_3">467</a>, <a href="/doc/556166/" id="a_4">468</a>, <a href="/doc/1466184/" id="a_5">471</a> and <a href="/doc/555306/" id="a_6">504</a> of the IPC.

</p><p id="p_3">                              The petitioner is agent of post-office. It is alleged that

                 the informant opened three PPF account in her name and in the

                 name of her family members on persuasion of the petitioner in the

                 year 2000. The informant invested total amount of Rs.18,84,000/-

                 but she was paid only 3,39,000/- as per account payee cheque. The

                 petitioner has thus defalcated the remaining amount.

</p><p id="p_4">                              Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1"> Patna High Court Cr.M isc. No.31506 of 2018 (3) dt.10-07-2018</span>

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                            2/3</span>




             allegation is false and frivolous. The petitioner no doubt is postal

             agent and his role was only to get the PPF account opened. The

             informant has not deposited any amount through this petitioner.

             There is not a single chit of paper to show that any amount was

             deposited in the post-office through the petitioner. The account

             was opened in the year 2000 but the allegation of not depositing

             the said amount in the account of the informant has been levelled

             after 15 years. The petitioner is in custody since 27.03.2018

             having clean antecedent and so he deserves to be enlarged on bail.

</p><p id="p_5">                           The learned APP as well as the Informant opposed the

             submissions by submitting that the petitioner collected more than

             18,00000/- from the informant for depositing the same in all the

             three accounts of the informant but the petitioner has only paid to

             the informant Rs.3,39,000/- as per account payee cheque and so

             he does not deserve to be enlarged on bail.
</p>
<p id="p_6">                           On perusal of the FIR, it appears that the allegation of

             depositing Rs.18,84,000/- in all the three accounts of the

             informant is vague. The informant has not disclosed the manner of

             depositing the amount in the post-office. The petitioner had or has

             no role in operation of PPF account. There is no explanation for

             remaining silent for 15 years. The details of amount allegedly

             deposited in all the three PPF Account have also not been

                       disclosed. The copy of pass-book annexed with the case diary

                       shows that, the post-office has paid the amount after due

                       calculation to the informant.

<p id="p_7">                                     In the facts and circumstances of the case, prayer for bail

                       of the petitioner is allowed. Let the above named petitioner be

                       released on bail on furnishing bail bond of Rs.10,000/- (ten

                       thousand) with two sureties of the like amount each to the

                       satisfaction of CJM, Saharsa in Saharsa Sadar P.S.Case No.576 of
