CORAM:
HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE SURESH KAIT

SURESH KAIT, J. (Oral)
</pre>
<p id="p_1">1.     By way of this petition filed under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_1">Section 482</a> of the Code of
Criminal Procedure, 1973, petitioner seeks quashing of FIR No.375/2011
registered at Police Station Shalimar Bagh, Delhi, for the offences
punishable under <a href="/doc/538436/" id="a_2">Sections 498A</a>/<a href="/doc/988620/" id="a_3">406</a>/<a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_4">34</a> IPC and the consequential
proceedings emanating therefrom against him.
</p>
<p id="p_2">2.     Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner submits that
the aforesaid case was registered on the complaint of respondent No.2,

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">Crl.M.C. No.4125 /2015                                               Page 1 of 9</span>
 namely, Smt. Pinglesh, consequent upon certain matrimonial and
domestic disputes having arisen between the parties. The case is at the
initial stage of trial as cognizance is not yet taken. Meanwhile, the
respondent No.2 and the petitioner have amicably settled their disputes for
a total sum of Rs.12,00,000/- (Twelve Lacs). To this effect, their joint
statement was recorded by the learned Principal Judge (North-West),
Family Courts, Rohini, Delhi, on 20.08.2014. As per the said settlement,
two instalments of Rs.3,00,000/- (Three Lacs) and Rs.5,00,000/- (Five
Lacs) were paid at the time of recording first motion petition and second
motion petition respectively for divorce by mutual consent and the
balance amount of Rs.4,00,000/- (Four Lacs) cash is paid today in the
Court, which is found to be correct. As per the settlement, custody of
three children of the respondent No.2 and the petitioner will remain with
the petitioner and the respondent No.2 shall neither claim custody nor
visitation rights of the children. It was also agreed between the parties that
out of the total amount, a sum of Rs.10,00,000/- (Ten Lacs) shall be kept
in the form of FDR for a period of 10 years and the respondent No.2 shall
be entitled to interest accrued thereon and shall deposit a copy of the same
in the Court. These facts have not been disputed by the respondent No.2
and her brother Aaskash, who is personally present in Court.
</p>
<p id="p_3">3.     Learned counsel for the petitioner further submits that consequent
to the said settlement, marriage between the petitioner and respondent
No.2 has been dissolved vide decree of mutual divorce dated 15.07.2015
under <a href="/doc/1439698/" id="a_5">Section 13</a> B (2) of the <a href="/doc/590166/" id="a_6">Hindu Marriage Act</a>, 1955. Since the
agreed amount has been paid by the petitioner, thus, respondent No.2 does
not wish to pursue her case further against the petitioner.
</p>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">Crl.M.C. No.4125 /2015                                            Page 2 of 9</span>
<p id="p_4"> 4.     Respondent No.2 is personally present in the Court alongwith her
brother and counsel named above and she has been duly identified by the
Investigating Officer of the case. The learned counsel under instructions
does not dispute the submissions made by learned counsel for the
petitioner and submits that the present matter has been amicably settled,
marriage between the respondent No.2 and the petitioner has been
dissolved vide decree of divorce dated 15.07.2015, she has received the
entire agreed amount and has no complaints whatsoever against the
petitioner No.1 and his family members. Respondent No.2 states that now
no dispute with petitioner survives and so, the proceedings arising out of
the FIR in question may be brought to an end.
</p>
<p id="p_5">5.     Learned Additional Public Prosecutor appearing on behalf of the
State submits that the case is at the initial stage of trial as cognizance is
not yet taken. He submits that the present matter is a matrimonial one and
since the respondent No.2 does not wish to pursue the case further against
petitioner, no purpose would be served if the petitioner is directed to face
trial. Therefore, the State has no objection, if the present petition is
allowed.
</p>
<p id="p_6">6.     Under the circumstances and looking to the decision of the
Supreme Court in the case of Gian Singh Vs. State of Punjab and
Another (2012) 10 SCC 303, wherein the Apex Court has referred to a
number of matters for the proposition that even a non-compoundable
offence can also be quashed on the ground of a settlement agreement
between the offender and the victim, if the circumstances so warrant; by
observing as under:
</p><p id="p_7">           "58.          ....However,   certain   offences     which
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">Crl.M.C. No.4125 /2015                                           Page 3 of 9</span>
            overwhelmingly and predominantly bear civil flavour
           having arisen out of civil, mercantile, commercial,
           financial, partnership or such like transactions or the
           offences arising out of matrimony, particularly relating
           to dowry, etc. or the family dispute, where the wrong is
           basically to the victim and the offender and the victim
           have settled all disputes between them amicably,
           irrespective of the fact that such offences have not been
           made compoundable, the High Court may within the
           framework of its inherent power, quash the criminal
           proceeding or criminal complaint or FIR if it is satisfied
           that on the face of such settlement, there is hardly any
           likelihood of the offender being convicted and by not
           quashing the criminal proceedings, justice shall be
           casualty and ends of justice shall be defeated."
</p>
<p id="p_8">7.     While recognizing the need of amicable resolution of disputes in
cases like the instant one, the aforesaid dictum has been affirmed by the
Apex Court in a recent judgment in Narinder Singh &amp; Ors. Vs. State of
Punjab &amp; Anr. 2014 6 SCC 466. The pertinent observations of the Apex
Court are as under:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">           29. In view of the aforesaid discussion, we sum up and
           lay down the following principles by which the High
           Court would be guided in giving adequate treatment to
           the settlement between the parties and exercising its
           power under Section 482 of the Code while accepting the
           settlement and quashing the proceedings or refusing to
           accept the settlement with direction to continue with the
           criminal proceedings:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">            29.1 Power conferred under Section 482 of the Code is
           to be distinguished from the power which lies in the
           Court to compound the offences under Section 320 of the
           Code. No doubt, under Section 482 of the Code, the High
           Court has inherent power to quash the criminal
           proceedings even in those cases which are not
           compoundable, where the parties have settled the matter

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">Crl.M.C. No.4125 /2015                                           Page 4 of 9</span>
            between themselves. However, this power is to be
           exercised sparingly and with caution.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">           29.2. When the parties have reached the settlement and
           on that basis petition for quashing the criminal
           proceedings is filed, the guiding factor in such cases
           would be to secure:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">           (i) ends of justice, or

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">           (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of any court.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">           While exercising the power the High Court is to form an
           opinion on either of the aforesaid two objectives.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_7">           29.3. Such a power is not to be exercised in those
           prosecutions which involve heinous and serious offences
           of mental depravity or offences like murder, rape,
           dacoity, etc. Such offences are not private in nature and
           have a serious impact on society. Similarly, for the
           offences alleged to have been committed under special
           statute like the <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_7">Prevention of Corruption Act</a> or the
           offences committed by public servants while working in
           that capacity are not to be quashed merely on the basis
           of compromise between the victim and the offender.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_8">           29.4. On the other hand, those criminal cases having
           overwhelmingly and predominantly civil character,
           particularly those arising out of commercial transactions
           or arising out of matrimonial relationship or family
           disputes should be quashed when the parties have
           resolved their entire disputes among themselves.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_9">           29.5. While exercising its powers, the High Court is to
           examine as to whether the possibility of conviction is
           remote and bleak and continuation of criminal cases
           would put the accused to great oppression and prejudice
           and extreme injustice would be caused to him by not
           quashing the criminal cases.
</blockquote>

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">Crl.M.C. No.4125 /2015                                          Page 5 of 9</span>
<blockquote id="blockquote_10">            29.6. Offences under <a href="/doc/455468/" id="a_8">Section 307</a> IPC would fall in the
           category of heinous and serious offences and therefore
           are to be generally treated as crime against the society
           and not against the individual alone. However, the High
           Court would not rest its decision merely because there is
           a mention of <a href="/doc/455468/" id="a_9">Section 307</a> IPC in the FIR or the charge is
           framed under this provision. It would be open to the
           High Court to examine as to whether incorporation of
           <a href="/doc/455468/" id="a_10">Section 307</a> IPC is there for the sake of it or the
           prosecution has collected sufficient evidence, which if
           proved, would lead to proving the charge under <a href="/doc/455468/" id="a_11">Section
           307</a> IPC. For this purpose, it would be open to the High
           Court to go by the nature of injury sustained, whether
           such injury is inflicted on the vital/delegate parts of the
           body, nature of weapons used, etc. Medical report in
           respect of injuries suffered by the victim can generally be
           the guiding factor. On the basis of this prima facie
           analysis, the High Court can examine as to whether
           there is a strong possibility of conviction or the chances
           of conviction are remote and bleak. In the former case it
           can refuse to accept the settlement and quash the
           criminal proceedings whereas in the latter case it would
           be permissible for the High Court to accept the plea
           compounding the offence based on complete settlement
           between the parties. At this stage, the Court can also be
           swayed by the fact that the settlement between the parties
           is going to result in harmony between them which may
           improve their future relationship.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_11">           29.7. While deciding whether to exercise its power under
           <a href="/doc/903398/" id="a_12">Section 482</a> of the Code or not, timings of settlement play
           a crucial role. Those cases where the settlement is
           arrived at immediately after the alleged commission of
           offence and the matter is still under investigation, the
           High Court may be liberal in accepting the settlement to
           quash the criminal proceedings/investigation. It is
           because of the reason that at this stage the investigation
           is still on and even the charge-sheet has not been filed.
           Likewise, those cases where the charge is framed but the
           evidence is yet to start or the evidence is still at infancy
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">Crl.M.C. No.4125 /2015                                            Page 6 of 9</span>
            stage, the High Court can show benevolence in
           exercising its powers favourably, but after prima facie
           assessment of the circumstances/material mentioned
           above. On the other hand, where the prosecution
           evidence is almost complete or after the conclusion of the
           evidence the matter is at the stage of argument, normally
           the High Court should refrain from exercising its power
           under <a href="/doc/903398/" id="a_13">Section 482</a> of the Code, as in such cases the trial
           court would be in a position to decide the case finally on
           merits and to come to a conclusion as to whether the
           offence under <a href="/doc/455468/" id="a_14">Section 307</a> IPC is committed or not.
           Similarly, in those cases where the conviction is already
           recorded by the trial court and the matter is at the
           appellate stage before the High Court, mere compromise
           between the parties would not be a ground to accept the
           same resulting in acquittal of the offender who has

           proved under <a href="/doc/455468/" id="a_15">Section 307</a> IPC and conviction is already
           recorded of a heinous crime and, therefore, there is no
           question of sparing a convict found guilty of such a
           crime."

<p id="p_9">8.     In the case of Jitendra Raghuvanshi &amp; Ors. Vs. Babita
Raghuvanshi &amp; Anr. (2013) 4 SCC 58, wherein the Supreme Court in
respect of the matrimonial disputes has specifically held as follows:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_12">            "15. In our view, it is the duty of the courts to
            encourage genuine settlements of matrimonial disputes,
            particularly, when the same are on considerable
            increase. Even if the offences are non-compoundable, if
            they relate to matrimonial disputes and the Court is
            satisfied that the parties have settled the same amicably
            and without any pressure, we hold that for the purpose
            of securing ends of justice, <a href="/doc/895891/" id="a_16">Section 320</a> of the Code
            would not be a bar to the exercise of power of quashing
            of FIR, complaint or the subsequent criminal
            proceedings.

<blockquote id="blockquote_13">            16. There has been an outburst of matrimonial disputes

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">Crl.M.C. No.4125 /2015                                           Page 7 of 9</span>
             in recent times. They institution of marriage occupies
            an important place and it has an important role to play
            in the society. Therefore, every effort should be made in
            the interest of the individuals in order to enable them to
            settle down in life and live peacefully. If the parties
            ponder over their defaults and terminate their disputes
            amicably by mutual agreement instead of fighting it out
            in a court of law, in order to do complete justice in the
            matrimonial matters, the courts should be less hesitant
            in exercising their extraordinary jurisdiction. It is trite
            to state that the power under <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_17">Section 482</a> should be
            exercised sparingly and with circumspection only when
            the Court is convinced, on the basis of material on
            record, that allowing the proceedings to continue
            would be an abuse of process of court or that the ends
            of justice require that the proceedings ought to be
            quashed...."

<p id="p_10">9.     Both the parties who are present in the Court today, approbate the
aforesaid settlement and joint statement dated 20.08.2014 and undertake
to remain bound by the same.
</p>
<p id="p_11">10.    Since the subject matter of this FIR is essentially matrimonial,
which now stands mutually and amicably settled between the parties and
the complainant is no longer interested in supporting the prosecution
because of which, its chances of success in the matter are now greatly
diminished. Therefore, in view of the law discussed above, in the facts
and circumstances as noted above, I am of the considered opinion that this
matter deserves to be given a quietus as continuance of proceedings
arising out of the FIR in question would be an exercise in futility.
