     The petitioner is a dealer of fuels under the Indian Oil

Corporation Ltd. The dealership agreement was issued by the 4th

respondent in favour of the petitioner in the year 2009.              No

Objection Certificate was issued by the District Collector under Rule

144 of the Petroleum Rules, 2002.
</p>
<p id="p_2">           When the petitioner was running the business of vending

petrol, a complaint came to be lodged regarding percolation of oil in

the neighbouring wells. There was death of two persons due to

suffocation while they were immersed into the well in 2012. These

facts resulted in an agitation in the area and consequently the

business of the petitioner came to be closed and from that day

onwards, the petroleum outlet is not functioning.

</p><p id="p_3">           In the mean while, since there was an allegation of

leakage of petrol and contamination of the neighbouring wells of the

public at large, the petitioner, with the help of Indian Oil

Corporation Ltd. proceeded to instal a new underground petrol tank

by dismantling the old one.
</p>
<p id="p_4">W.P.(C) No.11423 of 2016

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                  -: 2 :-</span>

            Ext.P9 letter dated 2.8.2016 issued by the Indian Oil

Corporation Limited reveals completion of works undertaken by the

petitioner for commencement of sales at M/s.Sivagiri Fuels, Feroke,

Kozhikode. It is mentioned in the said letter that a "new 20 KL MS

tank for storage of petrol in under driveway mat raft" is installed by

dismantling the existing "10 KL MS tank for petrol" and two

numbers "New Dual DUs" were installed and allied pipeline works

for dispensing product to customers were also done. The Indian Oil

Corporation has confirmed that the petroleum outlet is ready in all

respects to commence sales to general public. So also, the Kerala

State Pollution Control Board has given consent to operate the

petroleum outlet as per order dated 12.8.2016, which is valid upto

31.7.2019.
</p>
<p id="p_5">            From the aforementioned facts and circumstances, it is

amply clear that all the authorities have given no objection

certificate to the petitioner to run the petroleum outlet.

</p><p id="p_6">      2.    As per the direction of this Court, the Executive Director

of Centre for Water Resources Development and Management is

impleaded as additional 8th respondent and they also filed their no

objection.
</p>
<p id="p_7">W.P.(C) No.11423 of 2016

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                  -: 3 :-</span>

            Since we are satisfied that the petitioner has complied

with all the statutory requirements and has also taken sufficient

safeguards to avoid leakage of petrol by installing a new petrol tank,

he shall be permitted to run his petroleum outlet as required under

law. In case, if the petroleum outlet emanates certain objectionable

material, which may affect the water bodies in, under or near the

petroleum tank, it is open for the public at large to complain before

appropriate authorities.
</p>
<p id="p_8">            Be that as it may, since the petitioner has complied with

all the legal requirements and there is no leakage of petroleum

products as of now, he shall not be obstructed from running the

petroleum outlet.

above.
