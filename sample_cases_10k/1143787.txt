HEADNOTE:



JUDGMENT:
</pre><p id="p_1">			 O R D E R
     This special  leave petition  arises from	the order of
the High  Court of  Patna, made	 in Appeal from the Original
Order No.406/86 on July 24, 1996.
</p><p id="p_2">     The  respondent   had  filed   a  suit   for   specific
performance on the foot of an agreement alleged to have been
executed by the petitioner. The petitioner was served notice
but since  she did not contest the suit, ex-parte decree was
granted. Subsequently,	the petitioner	filed an application
under Order IX, Rule 13, C.P.C. seeking setting aside of the
ex-parte decree. Therein, her specific case was that she was
not residing  at Garhia	 Village and,  therefore, the notice
could not  be  deemed  to  have	 been  served  on  her.	 The
endorsement is	not correct.  The question  was gone into by
the courts below after recording the evidence of one Laxuman
Yadav, Mahendra	 Yadav and  process server. It is their case
that on	 January 15,  1985 when the summons were handed over
to Mst.	 Bhabia Devi  and when	she was	 acquainted with the
facts, she  refused to	sign or	 put thumb impression on the
notice. When  the process server had gone to serve it on her
personally on April 2, 1984 to the village and also on April
9, 1984	 when the  registered card acknowledgement was sent,
she refused to acknowledge it. Under those circumstance, the
courts below  have concluded and the High Court has recorded
as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">     "Apart from  the aforementioned two
     modes for	service of  notice, as I
     have already noticed, there was yet
     anther  mode   by	way  of	 Gazette
     publication. An  attempt  has  been
     made on  behalf of the appellant to
     say that  she being illiterate lady
     could not	learn about  the Gazette
     publication."</blockquote>
<p id="p_3">     This is  a finding	 of  fact  on  appreciation  of	 the
evidence. Thereby,  it is  clear that petitioner had refused
to accept  the notice. Consequently, she was rightly set ex-
parte. The  learned counsel  for  the  petitioner  seeks  to
contest the  case on  merits. We  cannot go  into the merits
since the  appeal was  not subject  matter  in	any  of	 the
appeals filed either under Section 96 or Section 100, C.P.C.
</p><p id="p_4">     The special leave petition is dismissed.
</p>
