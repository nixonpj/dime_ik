    was placed before the Industrial Court so as to suggest that the procedure

    of   Municipal   Council,   Tuljapur   while   delivering   it's   judgments   dated 

    11.12.2014   and   26.02.2015.   This   Court   had   issued   directions   to   the 




                                                  
    Municipal Council to submit a proposal to the appropriate Authority for 
                                  
    sanctioning of posts so as to absorb the daily rated employees in a phased 
                                 
    manner looking to their long standing continuance in employment.

<p id="p_66">    24              I   do   not   find   any   impediment   in   modifying   the   impugned 
       
    



    judgment to issue similar directions.
</p>




<p id="p_67">    25              The Petitioner has relied upon the judgment of the Division 

    Bench of this Court in the case of  State of Maharashtra v/s Pandurang 

    Sitaram Jahdav (supra). Paragraphs 9 and 17 have been cited to contend 





    that   the   daily-wagers   have   no   right   to   claim   permanency   in   public 

    employment. The Petitioner has recruited these daily-wagers more than 25 

    years   ago.   It   cannot   be   believed   that   the   Petitioner   could   pass   off   the 

    induction   of   the   Respondents   by   claiming   that   certain   politicians   had 

    appointed them.

               the relief of   making  the  workmen  permanent,  that  
               is,  to regularise them was not justified in as much as

               Bhandare   sought   to   rely     on   the     decision   of     this

               Union     vs.     Delhi   Administration,   Delhi</a>,   1992   (4)

               decision is applicable to the facts of the present case in  
               as much as the employment of persons on daily  wage  
   



               basis     under     Jawahar     Rozgar     Yojna     by   the  
               Development Department of   Delhi   Administration,  
               whose   claim   for   regularisation     was   dealt     in     the  
               aforesaid  case was entirely different  from that  of the  





               scheme   in     which   the   respondents-workmen   were  
               employed.   Jawahar   Rozgar   Yojna   was   evolved   to  
               provide income  for those who  are  below the poverty  
               line   and particularly during the periods when they  
               are without any source of livelihood and, therefore,  





               without any income  whatsoever. It is because of this  
               that   the   Bench   observed   that     the   object     of   the  
               scheme was not to provide right to   work as   such  
               even to the rural poor, much less to the unemployed in  
               general.   As   against   this,   the   workmen   who   were  
               employed     under   the  schemes  at   hand  had  been   so  
               done   to   advance   objects   having   permanent   basis   as  
               adverted to by us.

               has been   pointed   out   that the employer had   not

               under  this Act. This apart, a perusal of this Act shows

               <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_4">Industrial Disputes  Act</a>, 1947.  This is  apparent from  
               the perusal of <a href="/doc/1026708/" id="a_5">section 13</a> of this Act. It may be further  
   



               pointed out that   this Act having been brought into  
               force   from   1978,   could   not     have   applied   to   the  
               appointments at hand most of whom are of the year

                    Government keeping in  view its legal obligations and  
                    must   be   one   which   had   been   recommended   by   the  
                    State   Pay   Commission   and   accepted   by   the  
       

                    Government.   We   cannot   deny   this   relief   of  
                    permanency to  the respondent-workmen only because  
    



                    in   that   case   they     would   be     required   to     be   paid  
                    wages     meant     for   permanent   workers.     This   right  
                    flows automatically from the relief of   regularisation  
                    to which no   objection can reasonably be   taken, as  





                    already   pointed   out.   We   would, however, observe  
                    that the  relief  made  available  to the respondents is  
                    not one which would be available ipso facto to all the  
                    casual employees either of the Forests Department or  
                    any other Department   of   the   State.   Claim   of  





                    casual employees for   permanency or for higher pay  
                    shall have to be decided on the merits of their own  
                    cases."
