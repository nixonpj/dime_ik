<p id="p_1">ORDER
 

 Arun Kumar, J. 
</p> 

<p id="p_2">1.     Petitioner  has  filed this petition in which the  primary  relief  he 
seeks is the allotment of a seat in the MBBS/BDS Course in the second round 
of allotment which is to start from 9th September, 2000. 
</p> 

<p id="p_3">2.   The  petitioner  appeared  in Class-XII examinations  in  March,  2000 
conducted by Central Board of Secondary Education. Results of such examinations  are normally announced in the end of May or early June  every  year. 
However, Central Board of Secondary Education also conducts All India  Pre-Medical/Pre-Dental Entrance Examinations (PMT) which is normally  conducted 
before the Class-XII results are announced. Therefore, those who appear  in 
Class-XII  examination  are also allowed to take the PMT  examination  even 
when the Class-XII results are not declared. This examination was conducted 
on 14th May, 2000 and petitioner also appeared in the examination. 
</p> 

<p id="p_4">3.   Result  of  Class-XII examination was declared on 30th May,  2000.  As 
luck  would have it, petitioner although secured 60 or more marks  in  four 
papers, in Biology he could secure 42 marks. Passing marks for this subject 
being  45,  he was given compartment in Biology and for this paper  he  appeared in Supplementary examination which was held on 3rd August, 2000. 
</p> 

<p id="p_5">4.   In so far as PMT examination is concerned, result was declared on 14th 
July, 2000. Petitioner secured merit position/rank No.117 in All India Pre-
Medical/Pre-Dental Entrance Examination, 2000. Needless to mention, approximately two lakh students appeared in the said examination, and  therefore, 
rank No.117 is very commendable and high. As per his rank in the merit list 
petitioner was to appear for allotment of a seat by personal appearance, in 
the  first round of allotment which started on 2nd August,  2000.  However, 
the  result  of  Supplementary examination in Biology paper  taken  by  the 
petitioner  had not been declared and as per the Rules,  respondents  would 
not have allowed the petitioner to participate in the allotment process  in 
the  first  round. The result of Supplementary examination in  the  Biology 
paper  taken by the petitioner was declared on 30th August, 2000 and  petitioner secured 53 marks. Accordingly he was declared passed in 12th  examination.  Equipped with this result, petitioner approached  respondents  for 
considering him for allotment of a seat in the MBBS/BDS course and requested  that  a personal appearance be allowed to him in the  second  round  of 
allotment  which  is to commence from 9th September, 2000. He also  made  a 
written  representation to this effect. However, as his request was  turned 
down,  petitioner has filed this writ petition praying that he may be  considered for allotment of a seat in the second round of allotment. 
</p> 

<p id="p_6">5.   This  petition came up for hearing on 5th September, 2000  and  notice 
was  issued for 7th September, 2000 i.e. today. Notice was accepted on  5th 
September,  2000 in the Court by Mr. Anil Kumar on behalf of respondents  1 
and 2 and Ms. Rekha Palli for respondent No.3. 
</p> 

<p id="p_7">6.   Both  the counsel for respondents today made oral submissions  stating 
that  they do not wish to file the counter affidavits and with the  consent 
of the parties, matter was taken for final arguments and disposal,  keeping 
in view the urgency involved in this matter. 
</p> 

<p id="p_8">7.   Admittedly, in the first round of allotment candidates from S.No.1  to 
2000 in the merit list were called. Still certain seats are left and second 
round of allotment is to start from 9th September, 2000 and persons in  the 
merit  list at S.No. 2001 and below would be called for  allotment.  Before 
this exercise is done, the candidates who were allotted a seat in the first 
round and who wish to change their allotted college/course and wish to join 
the  same against some vacancies arising due to non-joining of  the  candidates in the first round of personal appearance would first be called. 
</p> 

<p id="p_9">8.   Our attention has been drawn to the judgment dated 7th September, 1999 
passed by Division Bench of this Court in LPA No.385 of 1999 entitled  Neha 
Kattyar  Vs. The Central Board of Secondary Education &amp; Ors. The  facts  of 
that case are almost identical as that of the present case. That was also a 
case  where the appellant had to appear in supplementary  examination.  She 
had  also appeared in the PMT and was placed in merit list at S.No.794.  By 
the time result of this supplementary examination was declared, first round 
of allotment was over which she missed and she had also filed writ petition 
seeking  direction  against the respondents to allot her the  seat  in  the 
second round of allotment. Although her writ petition was dismissed by  the 
Single  Bench,  the Division Bench by the aforesaid  judgment  allowed  her 
appeal  and directed the respondents to consider her at the time of  second 
round by personal appearance as a candidate having successfully passed  the 
qualifying examination. It was held that once the appellant passed  supplementary  examination of Class-XII, result of that would relate back to  the 
first  appearance in the said examination. The effect is that it  would  be 
treated  as  if the candidate had passed the Class-XII examination  on  the 
date  when the result was declared initially. On the basis of this  analogy 
in  the  present case, it would be deemed that the  petitioner  passed  the 
Class-XII examination on 30th May, 2000. The present writ petition,  therefore,  warrants  to be allowed following the aforesaid judgment  dated  7th 
September, 1999 in LPA No.385/1999. 
</p> 

<p id="p_10">9.   A direction is accordingly issued to the respondent No.3 to allow  the 
petitioner  to  appear in the second round of allotment which is  to  start 
from 9th September, 2000. Since the ranking of the petitioner in the  merit 
list is at S.No.117, petitioner would be considered in accordance with  the 
said  ranking.  The effect of that would be that when the second  round  of 
allotment  starts and candidates who are allowed a seat in the first  round 
are  to  be  considered for change of their  allotted  college/course,  the 
petitioner  shall  be  considered along with these candidates  as  per  his 
ranking in the merit list. In this respect we may mention that based on the 
direction  of  Supreme Court judgment the respondent No.3  has  prepared  a 
scheme  relating to admission in MBBS/BDS course on the basis of All  India 
Entrance Examination. As per para 7 of the said scheme, the allotment is to 
be  made  in order of merit, out of the seats available  for  allotment  at 
his/her  rank, through computer. Although it is stated in para 11 that  the 
candidates who fail to appear on notified date in person or through his/her 
authorised  representative  shall forfeit the claim for a  seat  under  All 
India  quota.  This  provision will not apply to  the  situation  like  the 
present  as the petitioner was prevented from appearing in the first  round 
due  to non-declaration of his result of supplementary examination of  Central Board of Secondary Education over which he had no control. 
</p> 

<p id="p_11">10.  Before parting we may point out that Class-XII examination is conduct-
ed  by Central Board of Secondary Education. Likewise, All India  Pre-Medi-
cal/Pre-Dental  Entrance  Examinations (PMT) is also conducted  by  Central 
Board of Secondary Education. The Central Board of Secondary Education  is, 
therefore,  aware of the fact that the persons who qualify in the  PMT  are 
called by respondent No.3 for allotment of seats. There is a fixed schedule 
in  this respect. Dates are known to Central Board of Secondary  Education. 
Therefore,  to  avoid  such problems in future, it would  be  advisable  if 
Central  Board of Secondary Education endeavours to declare the  result  of 
supplementary examination before the date when first round of allotment  of 
seat  is  commenced.  If Central Board of Secondary Education  is  able  to 
achieve  this,  the  problem of the kind which has come before  us  can  be 
avoided.
