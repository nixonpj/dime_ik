    ORAL JUDGMENT
    (Per: HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE RAJEEV RANJAN PRASAD)
    Date: 09-03-2018


                       Challenge in this batch of intra-court appeals is to a

        common judgment dated 25.05.2017 passed by a learned Writ Court

        in CWJC No. 8203 of 2014 and three other analogous Writ

        Applications.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                         3/10</span>




</p><p id="p_30">                       2. By the impugned judgment the learned Writ Court

        having considered the submissions of the parties materials available

        on the record recorded that the decision of the respondent Corporation

        to calculate the leave encashment / earned leave payment of the

        petitioner(s) on the basis of broken service in two stages, i.e., on

        retirement at the age of 58 years and the second stage of retirement at

        the age of 60 years cannot be held to be legal and justified. The

        learned Writ Court also held that the action of the Corporation

        (appellant herein) in holding back certain amount of gratuity from the

        balance received from the L.I.C. in the name of petitioner(s) cannot be

        justified and, therefore, the learned Writ Court set aside the impugned

        orders passed by the respondent authorities whereby the claim of the

        petitioner(s) for payment of balance leave encashment as per revision

        in salary in the Corporation on the date of retirement of the

        petitioner(s) on attainting the age of 60 years and payment of

        deducted amount of gratuity payable on the revised scale of pay were

        rejected. The learned Writ Court has directed the authorities of the

        Corporation to calculate encashment of earned leave of the

        petitioner(s) on the basis of their actual date of retirement and pay the

        balance admissible amount to the petitioners. A further direction has

        been issued to the respondents to release the amount deducted from

        gratuity paid to the petitioner(s) second time, even though the
 Patna High Court LPA No.1342 of 2017 dt.09-03-2018

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                         4/10</span>




        Corporation submitted that had had returned the same to the L.I.C. to

        meet the shortfall in the fund.
</p>
<p id="p_31">                       3. Learned counsel representing the Bihar State Financial

        Corporation (hereinafter referred to as 'the Corporation') / appellant

        submits that the impugned judgment of the learned Writ Court has not

        taken into consideration that the petitioners in these Writ Applications

        were made to retire at the age of 58 years, which was the age of

        superannuation at the relevant time. It is his case that since the

        petitioner(s) were allowed to join back because of judicial

        intervention and direction, they were not paid the salary for the period

        they had not rendered their duty but again by virtue of the order

        passed by the Court, the Corporation was made liable to pay salary to

        the employees of the Corporation for the period they were kept out of

        job before attaining 60 years of age. He submits that the Corporation

        vide its Office Order no. 07 of 2012-13 dated 04.03.2013 took a

        decision to the effect that the ex-employees of the Corporation who

        had retired at 58 years of age and attained the age of 60 years prior to

        the issuance of the order of enhancement of retirement age and such

        employees who retired at the age of 58 years but resumed their duties

        during the intervening period were allowed admissible salary and

        allowances (except conveyance allowance) for the period they were

        out of service. It is further case of the Corporation that pursuant to the
 Patna High Court LPA No.1342 of 2017 dt.09-03-2018

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                         5/10</span>




        said decision, all admissible dues were paid to the petitioner(s) in the

        light of the decision of this Court in CWJC No. 1324 of 2011

        (Yogeshwar Prasad Singh's case). The main contention of the learned

        counsel representing the Corporation / appellant is that having

        accepted all the admissible dues, the writ petitioners could not have

        raised an issue of non-payment of admissible dues, such as, (i)

        payment of lesser amount of leave encashment and (ii) payment of

        lesser amount of gratuity.
</p>
<p id="p_32">                       4. Learned counsel submits that the learned Writ Court

        could not appreciate that the writ petitioner(s) were already paid the

        admissible salary and all authorized amount for the period they were

        out of service and the learned Writ Court could not appreciate that

        they had not returned the amounts received from the respondents

        (present appellants) after their superannuation at the age of 58 years

        and, therefore, they have enjoyed interest over the said amounts.

</p><p id="p_33">                       5. Learned counsel representing the appellants further

        submits that as regards the payment of gratuity which is maintained

        by the L.I.C. in form of Group Gratuity Fund, the learned Writ Court

        could not appreciate that a major deficiency / shortfall occurred in the

        said fund as the same amount was not returned back to the

        Corporation and the panel officers were prematurely benefited to

        some extent. He submits that these aspects of the matter have not been
 Patna High Court LPA No.1342 of 2017 dt.09-03-2018

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                         6/10</span>




        considered by the learned Writ Court.
</p>
<p id="p_34">                       6. On the other hand, learned counsel representing the

        private respondents in all Letters Patent Appeals vehemently submits

        that the Corporation / appellants is in habit of indulging in litigation

        and they are treating it as luxury in an otherwise financial crippled

        Corporation. Learned counsel points out from the records that right

        from beginning the Corporation is taking illegal and arbitrary

        decisions one after another. At first instance, the private respondents

        were illegally made to superannuate at the age of 58 years when there

        were already a resolution of the Corporation taken on 25.08.2006

        whereunder the benefit of enhancement of the age of superannuation

        as provided by the State Government to its employees w.e.f.

        24.03.2005 were also extended to the employees of the Corporation /

        appellants but despite the said resolution dated 25.08.2006 these writ

        petitioners were made to retire.
</p>
<p id="p_35">                       7. The Employees Federation had to move this Court by

        fling a Writ Application in the Jharkhand High Court at Ranchi and

        after dismissal of the said Writ application the Employees Federation

        had to prefer a Letters Patent Appeal being LPA No. 83 of 2007 in the

        Hon'ble Jharkhand High Court at Ranchi. It is during pendency of this

        L.P.A. that the Corporation continued to superannuate its employees,

        who had attained 58 years of age but ultimately on final hearing LPA
 Patna High Court LPA No.1342 of 2017 dt.09-03-2018

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                         7/10</span>




        No. 83/2007 was allowed by the Hon'ble Jharkhand High Court vide

        order dated 22.04.2009. Our attention has been drawn towards the

        operation of the stay order which has been quoted in paragraph 10 of

        the impugned judgment.
</p>
<p id="p_36">                       8. Learned counsel pointed out that a Civil Review

        application preferred by the Corporation and subsequent Special

        Leave Petition before the Hon'ble Supreme Court were dismissed in

        limine. The petitioner(s) after dismissal of the S.L.P. submitted their

        joining reports. It is only on 19.04.2010 that the Corporation issued a

        standing order whereby they decided to enhance the age of

        superannuation from 58 to 60 years w.e.f. 25.08.2006. After issuance

        of the standing order dated 19.04.2010, the petitioner(s) were allowed

        to join back as they had not attained the age of 60 years and further

        they were allowed to superannuate on attaining the age of 60 years.

</p><p id="p_37">                       9. Learned counsel submits that there had been another

        round of litigation for these private respondents who had to move this

        Court for payment of their salaries as the Corporation was not allowed

        the same. A reference has been made to the order passed by this Court

        in CWJC No. 1324 of 2011. It is also stated that LPA Nos. 1656/2011

        and 1816/2011 preferred against the judgment of the Writ Court were

        dismissed and thereafter challenge to the same before the Hon'ble

        Supreme Court also failed. It is for these reasons that learned counsel
 Patna High Court LPA No.1342 of 2017 dt.09-03-2018

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                         8/10</span>




        submits that the Corporation has been harassing the private

        respondents by entering into litigation one after another even for the

        genuine cause of the private respondents.
</p>
<p id="p_38">                       10. At this stage, learned counsel submits that the Writ

        Court has rightly held by the impugned judgment that there cannot be

        two retirement dates of a government employee or in a government

        establishment. If the writ petitioner(s) were entitled to superannuate

        only on attaining the age of 60 years and they were wrongly retired at

        the age of 58 years, the Corporation / appellant cannot take any

        benefit whatsoever arising out of their own illegal act in retiring the

        writ petitioner(s) at the age of 58 years. The decision of the

        respondent Corporation to calculate the leave encashment amount on

        the basis of broken service of two stages, according to the learned

        counsel, has been rightly held to be illegal. He also submits that the

        learned Writ Court is correct in directing the Corporation / appellant

        to pay back the amount deducted from the gratuity amount.

</p><p id="p_39">                       11. We having hearing learned counsel for the parties and

        upon perusal of the records come to a considered opinion that there is

        no illegality or infirmity in the impugned judgment of the learned

        Writ Court. From the narration of facts and events stated hereinabove,

        it is evident that these writ petitioners were made to retire at the age of

        58 years even though they should have been retired at the age of 60

        years. By virtue of judicial orders and intervention they got restored to

        their position and received salaries for the said period also. The

        learned Writ Court is correct in saying that there cannot be two

        retirement dates of a government employee or in a government

        establishment. What has been done in the present case by the

        respondent / appellants is that they have calculated the payment of

        earned leave taking two broken service period in two stages, i.e., on

        retirement age of 58 years and retirement at the age of 60 years. This

        is unknown to service jurisprudence and has been rightly held so by

        the learned Writ Court, the date of retirement of the writ petitioners

        are liable to be taken as on the date they attained the age of 60 years

        and on the said date of retirement whatever rule prevailed with regard

        to the maximum days for encashment of leave will be fully applicable

        to the writ petitioners.

<p id="p_40">                       12. The learned Writ Court has rightly come to a

        conclusion that the action of the Corporation in holding back certain

        amount of gratuity from the balance received from the L.I.C. in the

        name of petitioners cannot be justified. Here we find that the Group

        Gratuity Fund is maintained by the Corporation / appellant by virtue

        of an agreement entered into between the Corporation and the L.I.C.

        of India whereunder the Corporation has to make contribution for its

        employees in terms of the scheme of the L.I.C. so as to take care of

                  their liabilities on account of gratuity when an employee retires. It

                  appears from the statements in the Letters Patent Appeal itself that a

                  sum of Rs. 23,758/- was deducted from the gratuity paid to the

                  beneficiary second time because they had been a shortfall in the

                  Group Gratuity Fund. We understand that the shortfall which occurred

                  in the Group Gratuity Fund was because of non-payment of

                  contribution on account of these writ petitioners by the Corporation /

                  appellants to the L.I.C. For this shortfall, the writ petitioners cannot be

                  held liable and they cannot be made to suffer by way of deduction of

                  salary of Rs. 23,758/- from their lesser dues on account of gratuity.

</p><p id="p_41">                               13. The direction of the learned Writ Court in the facts and

                  circumstances of the present case is wholly correct and need no

                  interference at this stage. The Letters Patent Appeals are, therefore,

                  dismissed.
