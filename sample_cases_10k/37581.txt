<p id="p_1">      The petitioner has approached this court challenging the

order passed by the respondents discharging him on medical

ground, more than four decades ago, i.e., on 18.11.1966; such

action having wrongly been done just 25 days prior to his

completion of 'nine years' for making him eligible to have

obtained the normal service pension. The specific case of the

petitioner is that the respondents have not even stated the

'disease' which the petitioner was suffering from at the time of

his discharge or as to the 'percentage of disability', while their

contention that the petitioner was having "Anxiety State (310)"

and hence not fit enough to continue in service, is only an

improvisation of the case to mould their defence in the counter

affidavit filed in the present proceedings.

</p><p id="p_2">      2. The petitioner commenced his service in the Indian Air

Force as an Airman on 13.12.1957 and after completing 8 years

and 341 days of service, he was discharged on 'medical ground'

O.P. No. 25812 OF 1999

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                  2</span>

on 18.11.1966. Ext.P1 discharge card shows that the 'character

and general behaviour' of the petitioner during his career was

'very good' throughout      and his 'trade proficiency' has been

recorded as 'superior'. The very same factual particulars have

been incorporated in Ext.P4 discharge book issued to him

pursuant to the appropriate proceedings taken by the petitioner.

</p><p id="p_3">      3.   It is seen from the materials on record that the

petitioner had put forth a claim to provide at least the 'medical

disability pension', which was turned down by the department

vide Ext. P5 stating that the concerned disability (however, not

specifically denoted) was not attributable to Air Force service

and further that it had not been aggravated        because of the

service rendered by the petitioner in the Air Force. Even though,

the     petitioner   preferred      an    appeal     before    the

Government/concerned authority through proper channel, it also

met with the same fate of rejection, as borne by Ext. P11;

without disclosing or discussing the particular disease or the

extent of disability actually suffered by the petitioner, which, in

turn is subjected to challenge in this O.P.
</p>
<p id="p_4">O.P. No. 25812 OF 1999

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                  3</span>

</p><p id="p_5">      4.   The respondents have filed their counter affidavit

sustaining the action pursued by them, asserting that the

petitioner was medically boarded       out of      service  by    the

Invalidating Medical Board duly constituted under the relevant

provisions of the      Air Force Rules, 1932,     on account of his

disease "Anxiety State       (310)".    It is pointed out that the

Invalidating Medical Board       had assessed the percentage of

disability at 20%, which made the pension sanctioning authority

to reject the claim of the petitioner for 'disability pension' on the

ground that the      disease from which the petitioner had been

suffering from was neither attributable to nor aggravated by the

Air Force service.     It is also stated in paragraph No.3 of the

counter affidavit that the respondents are not bound to keep the

records   beyond the stipulated period of 25 years and hence,

that, no records are available with the Air Force Record Office to

verify the position, for having destroyed them as 'life expired

documents'.
</p>
<p id="p_6">      5. Obviously, the actual 'disease' of the petitioner and the

'extent of disability', as mentioned in the counter affidavit are not

O.P. No. 25812 OF 1999

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                  4</span>

discernible from any of the documents issued from the office of

the respondents at any point of time, as         produced by the

petitioner along with the Original Petition.     It is for the said

reason that this court, after considering the relevant facts and

figures, passed an interim order on 01.06.2007 directing the

respondents to produce the documents as to the basis on which

the specific averments are made in the counter affidavit as

mentioned above. The fact remains that no such document has

been produced by the respondents till date; nor have they filed

any additional affidavit or statement explaining the       "source"

from where they got the particulars/data as to the 'actual

disease' and 'extent of disability', to have them incorporated in

the counter affidavit when the records are stated as destroyed

already.
</p>
<p id="p_7">      6. It is true that there is considerable lapse on the part of

the petitioner in pursuing his rights and remedies before this

court. The order of discharge, having been passed more than 40

years ago, is no more open to challenge and as such, this court

does not find it fit and proper to entertain the claim on this

O.P. No. 25812 OF 1999

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                 5</span>

head. However, it is very much relevant to note that the

statutory appeal preferred by the petitioner      is not seen dealt

with properly      and no 'speaking order' was passed while

dismissing the same, as conveyed to the petitioner vide Ext.P11.

That apart, while pointing out the 'specific disease' on the basis

of which the petitioner was medically discharged and as to the

extent of disability in the counter affidavit, no attempt has been

made from the part of the respondents to produce the relevant

documents in       compliance  with    the interim    order  dated

01.06.2007.    This persuades this court to      draw an adverse

inference against the respondents who have made rather

contradictory/inconsistent statements in submitting       that  no

records are available with them for having been destroyed as

'life expired documents' on one hand,       while asserting on the

other hand that the petitioner was suffering from the 'specified

disease' and that the 'extent of his disability' was certified by

the Medical Board at '20%'. The respondents are blowing hot

and cold simultaneously, which does not appear to be correct or

proper.
</p>
<p id="p_8">O.P. No. 25812 OF 1999

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                 6</span>

</p><p id="p_9">     7. Considering the similar course pursued by this court on

an earlier occasion vide judgment dated          16.08.1999      in

O.P.No.17488 of 1995 alerting the respondents as to the burden

cast upon their shoulders, this court finds it fit and proper to

direct the respondents to re-consider the matter afresh, taking

note of all the relevant facts and figures and to pass a speaking

order thereon . This is more so since, the petitioner had served

the Indian Air Force for 8 years and 11 months and was just

short of 25 days of service to have completed '9' years to make

him eligible to have the normal service pension. That apart, as

revealed from Ext.P1/P4 discharge proceedings, the 'character

and general behavior' of the petitioner was 'very good'

throughout     and his 'trade proficiency' had been admittedly

'superior'.  When the petitioner has got the alleged disease

without any previous history, the burden of establishing it lies on

the Defence Authorities as held by a Division Bench of this court

in <a href="/doc/554446/" id="a_1">Ravi vs. Union of India</a> (1998 (1) KLT 56), as relied on in

the judgment dated 16.08.1999 in O.P.No.17488 of 1995

mentioned herein before.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                 7</span>

       In the above facts and circumstances the second

respondent is hereby directed to re-consider the appeal preferred

by the petitioner, which is stated as rejected vide Ext. P11 and

shall pass a 'speaking order' thereon taking a pragmatic

approach and lenient view,    as expeditiously as possible, and at

any rate, within a period of three months from the date of

receipt of a copy of the judgment. The impugned orders are set

aside to the above extent and the Original Petition is disposed of

accordingly. The petitioner shall produce a copy of this judgment

before the second respondent along with a copy of the Writ

Petition and the counter affidavit filed therein so as to enable the

said respondent to proceed with the matter.
