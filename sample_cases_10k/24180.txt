                     Dated this, the 2nd June, 2008.

                               J U D G M E N T
</pre>
<p id="p_1">      Petitioner is the management in I.D.No. 88/2000 before the

Industrial Tribunal, Alappuzha. The petitioner is challenging Ext. P1

award passed by the Tribunal in that I.D. The issue referred for

adjudication was:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">      "Whether the action of the management of Balmer Lawrie &amp; Co.
      Ltd., Aroor in denying the employment to 16 canteen workers (list
      enclosed) and also not treating them as Company's employees is
      justified? If not, to what relief the workers are entitled?"
</blockquote>
<p id="p_2">The Tribunal noted that the canteen is one managed by the petitioner

under <a href="/doc/759329/" id="a_1">Section 46</a> of the Factories Act and relying on the decision of

the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/694239/" id="a_2">National Thermal Power Corporation v. Karri

Pothuraju and others</a>, 2003-III LLJ 567, held that the workmen of the

canteen are workmen of the petitioner although engaged through a

contractor. The petitioner submits that the Supreme Court itself had,

in a later decision in <a href="/doc/729412/" id="a_3">Haldia Refinery Canteen Employees Union and

another v. Indian Oil Corporation Ltd. and others</a>, 2005-II LLJ 684,

held that employees in a statutory canteen run by a contractor are

employees of the principal employer only for the purpose of <a href="/doc/1955064/" id="a_4">Factories

Act</a> and not for any other purpose. The petitioner therefore submits

that simply because the canteen is a statutory canteen ipso facto it

does not lead to the inference             that the canteen employees are

employees of the factory. He would further submit that since the

Union has not adduced any evidence to show that the contract

between the petitioner and           the contractor is a sham document,

without which the Tribunal could not have come to the conclusion

that the workers under the contractor are regular workers of the

Company.
</p>
<p id="p_3">      2. I have considered the contentions of the petitioner in detail.

</p><p id="p_4">      3. Counsel for the 1st respondent Union is not present.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">W.P.C. No. 15276/2004            -: 2 :-</span>

</p><p id="p_5">      4.   A reading of Ext. P1 award would show that the Tribunal

solely relied on the Supreme Court decision in National Thermal

Power Corporation's case (supra) to hold that since the canteen is a

statutory canteen, the canteen employees are employees of the

petitioner. In view of the decision of the Supreme Court in Haldia

Refinery's case (supra), I do not think that the Tribunal, without any

further evidence to show that the facts and circumstances would lead

to the conclusion that the workers of the contractor were direct

employees of the Company, could have held that the workers are

workers of the petitioner. As held by a Division Bench of this Court in

<a href="/doc/1709161/" id="a_5">Hindustan Newsprint Industrial Canteen Workers Union v. Hindustan

Newsprint Ltd</a>., 2006 KLT 103, it all would depend on the evidence

on various aspects such as, whether the contract entered into

between the principal employer and the contractor is a bona fide or a

sham transaction, whether the terms of the contract would amount to

in fact absolute control on the part of the principal employer in the

running of the canteen, whether the principal employer had any role

in the recruitment of the employees, whether the principal employer

had control over the employees of the canteen etc., etc.,. Here, the

Tribunal does not refer to any evidence whatsoever other than the

fact that it is a statutory canteen under <a href="/doc/759329/" id="a_6">Section 46</a> of the Factories

Act to hold that the workers are direct employees of the Company. I

am of opinion that without any evidence regarding the fact as to

whether the contract between the petitioner and its contractor is a

sham document and other circumstances leading to the irresistible

conclusion that the workers were actually workers of the Company,

the Tribunal could not have come to that conclusion.        Therefore,

clearly Ext. P1 award is unsustainable.     Accordingly, the same is

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">W.P.C. No. 15276/2004            -: 3 :-</span>

quashed. I hold that in that I.D., the workers are not entitled to any

reliefs.
