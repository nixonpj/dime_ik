<p id="p_1">                               Petitioner has approached this Court praying for issuance

            of a writ of mandamus directing the respondents to prepone the date

            of his regularization of services to 01.02.1996 instead of 01.10.2003

            as has been granted to him vide order dated 29.07.2004.

</p><p id="p_2">                               It is the contention of the counsel for the petitioner that

            the petitioner was entitled to regularization of his services w.e.f.

            01.02.1996, the date on which his juniors have been regularized vide

            order dated 18.05.2011 (Annexure P-4).               Referring to the Chart

            prepared by him in para 19 of the writ petition, he contends that the

            persons mentioned therein have all been appointed after the

            petitioner was appointed and, therefore, they came into service after

            the petitioner as Beldar and since the petitioner was already serving

            the respondents prior to the said persons, he has acquired a similar

            right of regularization of his services w.e.f. 01.02.1996 having longer

            length of service.
</p>
<p id="p_3">                               Petitioner was appointed as a Beldar on daily wage basis

            in June, 1986 by the Executive Engineer, Provincial Division, PWD

            B&amp;R Branch, Faridabad-respondent No. 3 and he served the

            respondents till 01.06.1994 when his services were terminated

            without complying with the provisions of the <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_1">Industrial Disputes Act</a>,

            1947. Petitioner raised an industrial dispute, which was referred to

            the Labour Court, Faridabad for adjudication. Award dated 3/20-03-

            1997 was passed in favour of the petitioner, vide which the petitioner

            was reinstated with continuity of service. Copy of the Award has

            been appended as Annexure P-1.               Petitioner was taken back in

            service.           He submitted a representation for regularization of his

            services as per the Haryana Government Instructions dated

            27.05.1993 but the said representation was not decided, however,

            his services were regularized vide order dated 29.07.2004 w.e.f.

            01.10.2003 (Annexure P-3). He fulfills the conditions, as have been

            laid down under Instructions/Policy of the Government of Haryana

            dated 7/18-03-1996, which entitle a daily wage employee to

            regularization w.e.f. 01.02.1996 on completion of 3 years of service

            01.02.1996 is being denied only on the ground that on the said date,

            the petitioner was not in service. This ground of the respondents

            cannot be accepted in the light of the Award dated 3/20-03-1997

            (Annexure P-1) passed by the Labour Court, Faridabad holding

            therein the termination of the services of the petitioner on 01.06.1994

            as illegal and violative of the provisions of the <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_2">Industrial Disputes Act</a>,

            1947 and further reinstating him in service with continuity thereof. In

            the light of the Award of the Labour Court, it cannot be said that the

            petitioner was not in service on the relevant date, which would entitle

            him to consideration for regularization.
</p>
<p id="p_4">                               Counsel for the petitioner has placed reliance upon the

            judgment passed by this Court in CWP No. 5848 of 2011 titled as

            <a href="/doc/106954944/" id="a_3">Karamvir Singh vs. State of Haryana and another</a>, decided on

            11.01.2012 (Annexure P-6), which judgment has been upheld by the

            Division Bench of this Court in LPA No. 1236 of 2012 titled as <a href="/doc/48639280/" id="a_4">State

            of Haryana and others vs. Krishan Singh</a>, decided on 28.08.2012

            (Annexure P-7). He, accordingly, prays that the writ petition deserves

            to be allowed.
</p>
<p id="p_5">                               On the other hand, counsel for the respondents contends

            that the claim of the petitioner cannot be accepted in the light of the

            fact that the petitioner did not fulfil the requisite qualifications as per

            the Haryana Government Instructions dated 7/18-03-1996 as he was

            not in service on the relevant date i.e. 31.01.1996. He has only

            been reinstated on 03.03.1997 after passing of the Award by the

            Labour Court and, therefore, the said benefit cannot be granted. He

            the Government of Haryana for regularization of the services, stand

            withdrawn w.e.f. 25.04.2007(Annexure R-1) in the light of the

            judgment of the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/104090797/" id="a_5">State of Karnataka vs. Uma Devi</a>

            (2006) 4 SCC 1. Prayer has thus, been made for dismissal of the

            writ petition.
</p>
<p id="p_6">                               I have considered the submissions made by the counsel

            for the parties and with their assistance, have gone through the

            records of the case.
</p>
<p id="p_7">                               The fact that the persons mentioned in para-19 of the writ

            petition are junior to the petitioner on the ground that they were

            appointed/engaged on daily wage basis after the petitioner and the

            date of their regularization has not been disputed. However, it has

            been stated that there is no seniority list of daily wagers maintained

            by the department. It is also not disputed that the services of the

            petitioner were terminated on 01.06.1994, which was challenged by

            the petitioner through an industrial dispute raised by him, which

            Award ended in his favour dated 3/20-03-1997 passed by the Labour

            Court, Faridabad, wherein he was reinstated in service with continuity

            thereof.
</p>
<p id="p_8">                               If that be so, the stand of the respondents that the

            petitioner was out of service on the relevant date i.e. 31.01.1996

            cannot be accepted as the legal fiction would entitle the petitioner to

            be in service on the said date.           Except for this reason, no other

            ground has been taken that the petitioner did not fulfil the

            requirement as mandated under the instructions dated 7/18-03-1997

                               That apart, even if it is accepted that all instructions for

            regularization of the services of the ad-hoc/contractual/daily wagers

            and part-time workers stood withdrawn vide instructions dated

            25.05.2007 (Annexure R-1), still the constitutional right of the

            petitioner qua equality under Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution

            cannot be obliterated. Since similarly placed persons in all respects,

            who had been appointed subsequent to the petitioner in service,

            have been regularized w.e.f. 01.02.1996, which fact, as mentioned in

            para-19 of the writ petition, has not been disputed specifically by the

            respondents, entitles the petitioner to the same benefit of

            regularization of his services w.e.f. 01.02.1996. The claim of the

            petitioner is further covered in his favour by the judgment of this

            Court in Karamvir Singh's case (supra), which has been upheld by

            the Division Bench in LPA No. 1236 of 2012 (Annexures P-6 and P-7

            respectively).

            w.e.f. 01.02.1996. Direction is issued to the respondents to pass

            appropriate orders preponing his date of regularization, as has been

            observed above, within a period of two months' from the date of

            receipt of certified copy of the order. The consequential benefits be
