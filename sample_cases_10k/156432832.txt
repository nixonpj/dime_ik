<p id="p_1">     The appellant herein challenges the conviction and

sentence against him under Sections 7 and 13 (2) read with

Section 13 (1) (d) of the <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_1">Prevention of Corruption Act</a>, 1988

( for short "the <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_2">P.C Act</a>"). He was the District Registrar

(General) at Malappuram in November-December, 2000.

He faced prosecution before the            learned Enquiry

Commissioner and Special Judge (Vigilance), Kozhikode in

C.C 82 of 2002 on a final report submitted by the Vigilance

and Anti-Corruption Bureau (VACB), Malappuram in a crime

registered on the complaint of one Prabhakaran. The said

Prabhakaran and his brother Sundaran had purchased two

items of properties in September, 1999 from one

Beerankutty. The complainant Prabhakaran purchased

55.9 cents and the brother Sundran purchased 32 = cents.

On the report of the Sub Registrar regarding under

valuation of the sale deeds, the appellant,      as District

Registrar initiated proceedings under the Kerala Stamp

(Prevention of Under Valuation of     Instruments)   Rules,

1968 (for short "the Rules). On 12.10.2000, the appellant

passed provisional order under the Rules fixing the amount

of    consideration,    and directed     the  complainant

Prabhakaran and his brother Sundaran to remit the deficit

amount of stamp duty and registration fee. On getting the

provisional orders, Prabhakaran and Sundaran submitted

an application before the Registrar requesting for some

lenient consideration. They denied the allegation that the

properties were in fact purchased for high amount as

suggested by the Sub Registrar. The prosecution case is

that when Prabhakaran and Sundaran made request before

the appellant as District Registrar for some concession in

the matter of stamp duty and registration fee, he

demanded an amount of  2000/- as illegal gratification for

passing final orders reducing the amount of stamp duty

and registration fee. It is alleged that    he made such

demand on 22.11.2000, and he repeated the same on

29.11.2000 and also on 12.12.2000. The complainant

Crl.A No. 983 of 2007
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                 3</span>


Prabhakaran was instructed by the appellant to come on

13.12.2000 with the amount, and he offered that he would

pass necessary orders in his favour, if he paid  2000/- as

illegal gratification. On 12.12.2000, Prabhakaran made a

complaint before the Dy.S.P (VACB), Malappuram, on which

the vigilance registered a crime and arranged a trap. The

amount of  2000/- brought by the complainant was

received as per an entrustment mahazar by the Dy.S.P on

13.12.2000,         and after demonstrating the   required

phenolphthalein test to the complainant, and the trap

witnesses, the complainant was instructed to approach the

District Registrar at his office and make payment on

demand.         Accordingly, the complainant  Prabhakaran

approached the accused at his office at Malappuram and

made payment of  2000/- when he repeated the demand.

After receiving the amount, the District Registrar issued

necessary orders reducing the amount of consideration,

and handed over the orders endorsed by him to the

complainant, with direction to hand it over to the

concerned Section Clerk for issuing the required final

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                   4</span>


orders.       On getting signal from the complainant, the

vigilance party led by the Dy.S.P reached there, seized the

phenolphthalein tainted currency from the possession of

the accused, and arrested him on the spot.               After

investigation, the VACB submitted final report before the

trial court.
</p>
<p id="p_2">       2.      The appellant/accused appeared before the

learned trial Judge, and pleaded not guilty to the charge

framed against him under <a href="/doc/324254/" id="a_3">Sections 7</a> and <a href="/doc/178303/" id="a_4">13</a> (2) read with

<a href="/doc/178303/" id="a_5">Section 13</a> (1) (d) of the <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_6">P.C Act</a>. The prosecution examined

eight witnesses including the complainant, and also proved

Exts. P1 to P32 documents. MO1 to MO10 material objects

were       also     identified during  trial,  including   the

phenolphthalein tainted currency of 2,000/-. When

examined under <a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_7">Section 313</a> Cr.P.C, the accused denied

the incriminating circumstances and projected a defence

that the trap in this case was viciously arranged by the

police at the instance of a political party leader, who in fact

used the complainant to make a false complaint, and that

when he just went to the bath room, the tainted money was

Crl.A No. 983 of 2007
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                  5</span>


in fact put in the drawer of his table stealthily   by the

complainant.         Thus, he pleaded ignorance  about the

tainted money that happened to be seized from his table

drawer.       No evidence was adduced in defence by the

accused though opportunity was granted by the trial court.

On an appreciation of the evidence, the learned trial Judge

found the accused guilty. On conviction, he was sentenced

to undergo rigorous imprisonment for two years each, and

to pay a fine of  5000/- each under <a href="/doc/324254/" id="a_8">Sections 7</a> and <a href="/doc/178303/" id="a_9">13</a> (2)

read with <a href="/doc/178303/" id="a_10">Section 13</a> (1) (d) of the <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_11">P.C Act</a> by judgment

dated 30.5.2007. Aggrieved by the said judgment of

conviction, the accused has come up in appeal.

</p><p id="p_3">       3.      When this appeal came up for hearing, the

learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the trap in

this case was viciously arranged by the police on a false

complaint made by the complainant Prabhakaran, and that

the tainted money was in fact put in the table drawer of the

accused by the complainant stealthily when the accused

went to the bath room.
</p>
<p id="p_4">Crl.A No. 983 of 2007
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                 6</span>


</p><p id="p_5">       4.      The learned Public Prosecutor submitted that

demand and acceptance of illegal gratification stands well

proved in this case by the evidence of the complainant and

the trap witness, and that the prosecution case is further

proved by the documents proved by the witnesses. Of the

eight witnesses examined by the prosecution, PW1 is the

complainant Prabhakaran, PW2 is the trap witness, PW3 is

the Junior Superintendent of the District Registrar's office

who produced some documents and also witnessed the

arrest of the accused, PW4 is the Assistant Engineer who

prepared the scene plan, PW5 is an attestor to the Ext.P20

seizure mahazar, PW6 is the U.D Clerk of the District

Register's office who produced some documents before the

police, PW8 is the Dy.S.P who detected the offence and

investigated the case, and PW7 is the Vigilance Officer who

submitted final report in court.     Of the 32 documents

proved by the prosecution, the important documents are

Exts.P3 and P4 provisional orders passed by the District

Registrar,       Exts.P5 and P6   requests  made   by   the

complainant and his brother, and Exts.P9 and P10 orders

Crl.A No. 983 of 2007
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                  7</span>


passed by the District Registrar on the date of trap,

reducing the amount of consideration for assessment of

stamp duty. The complainant Prabhakaran, and also the

trap witness, fully supported the prosecution.

</p><p id="p_6">       5.      PW1, the complainant has given evidence fully

substantiating the allegations in the Ext.P7 complaint made

by him. In Ext.P7 complaint, the case of the complainant is

that he purchased 55.9 cents of property from one

Beerankutty for  60,000/- and his brother Sundaran

purchased 32 = cents of property for a consideration of 

40,000/-. Exts.P1 and P2 are the copies of the sale deeds.

Ext.P1 sale deed shows a consideration of  18,000/-

whereas       the consideration stated in the complaint is 

60,000/-. So also, Ext.P2 document shows a consideration

of  12,000/-, whereas the consideration shows in the

complaint is  40,000/-. Thus, it is quite clear that the sale

documents were undervalued when the complainant and

his brother purchased properties from Beerankutty as per

Exts.P1 and P2 documents. On an enquiry, the Sub

Registrar found that the documents were undervalued.

Crl.A No. 983 of 2007
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                     8</span>


Accordingly, the Sub Registrar recommended action under

the Rules and submitted a report that the probable

consideration paid for the Ext.P1 property is  60,000/- and

the probable consideration paid for the Ext.P2 property is 

40,000/-. This is the exact the consideration stated by the

complainant in his complaint. Thus a clear case of under

valuation stands well proved.          Proceedings were rightly

initiated under the Stamp Rules by the District Registrar, on

the report of the Sub Registrar.            Here assumes the

importance of the allegations made against the appellant,

that he demanded and accepted illegal gratification for

passing final orders, reducing the amount of probable

consideration, and thereby reducing the amount of deficit

stamp duty.
</p>
<p id="p_7">       6.      PW1 is definite in his evidence that when he met

the District Registrar on 22.11.2000 and made a request

orally and also in writing to pass favourable orders in the

matter of deficit stamp duty, the District Registrar

demanded           2000/-    as   illegal gratification.  The

complainant was required to meet him on 29.11.2000. On

Crl.A No. 983 of 2007
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                    9</span>


that day also,        he repeated the demand.      When the

complainant called the District Registrar over telephone on

12.12.2000 also,         the District Registrar repeated the

demand        and    asked   the  complainant to   come   on

13.12.2000. As the complainant was not inclined to make

payment of bribe,            he made Ext.P7 complaint on

12.12.2000 on which a trap was arranged by the vigilance

on 13.12.2000. His evidence is that the amount of  2000/-

brought by him was received by the Dy.S.P as per a

mahzar,        and    after   treating the    currency  with

phenolphthalein, he was directed to approach the District

Registrar         at his office and make payment of the

phenolphthalein tainted currency. Accordingly, he met the

District Registrar at his office and made payment of the

phenolphthalein tainted currency, when he made demand

further.        Immediately, the District Registrar    made

endorsement reducing the amount of consideration for

Ext.P1 property to  27,000/- as against  60,000/-

suggested by the Sub Registrar, and reducing the amount

of consideration for Ext.P2 property to  20,000/- as against

Crl.A No. 983 of 2007
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                               10</span>

 40,000/- suggested by the Sub Registrar. Exts.P5 and P6

were identified as the written requests made by the

complainant and his brother when the complainant met the

District Registrar on getting Exts.P3 and P4 provisional

orders. The complainant proved Ext.P10 order of the

District Registrar reducing the consideration for Ext.P1

property and also Ext.P9 order of the District Registrar

reducing the consideration for Ext.P2 property.   These are

the two orders written by the District Registrar in his own

hand in green ink, and these two orders were identified and

proved by the complainant. As per Ext.P9 order, the

consideration for Ext.P2 property was reduced to  20,000/-

as against  40,000/- assessed by the Sub Registrar and as

per Ext.P10 order, the consideration for the Ext.P1 property

was reduced to  27,000/- as against  60,000/- suggested

by the Sub Registrar.      The complainant is definite in

evidence that these two orders were passed by the District

Registrar after receiving the amount of tainted money of 

2000/- from him at his office.

</p><p id="p_9">       7.        As per Ext.P3 provisional order, the amount of

consideration assessed for Ext.P1 property is  60,000/- and

as    per     Ext.P4    provisional   order,  the   amount   of

consideration fixed for the Ext.P2 property is  40,000/.

The evidence of the complainant well proves that on

getting an illegal gratification of  2000/- on 13.12.2000,

the District Registrar reduced the proposed consideration

for Ext.P1 property to  27,000/-, consequently reducing

the amount of deficit stamp duty, and he reduced the

proposed sale consideration for Ext.P2 property to 

20,000/- from  40,000/- suggested by the Sub Registrar

thereby reducing the amount of deficit stamp duty. Ext.P9

and P10 orders are not disputed by the defence. These

are the orders or endorsements made by the District

Registrar, consequent to which final orders under the

Stamp Rules will be passed assessing the amount of deficit

stamp duty. Exts.P5 and P6 written representations are not

disputed by the defence.        The defence case is that these

requests were        probably made on 13.12.2000, but the

complaint made on 12.12.2000 mentions about such a

request. On this ground, the learned counsel submitted

that the complaint is suspicious.
</p>
<p id="p_10">       8. PW2, the trap witness has well corroborated the

complainant on all material aspects. His evidence is that as

instructed by the Dy.S.P.(Vigilance) after   demonstrating

the required phenolphthalein test on 13.12.000, he

accompanied the complainant to the District Registrar's

office.     The complainant went inside and he remained

outside at the varandha.         He could over-hear the

conversation between them, and he could also witness the

things through the half door on the entry door to the

District Registrar's chamber. Just when the complainant

entered the chamber, he heard some conversation between

him and the Registrar, regarding some money, and within

no time, the complainant came outside. After sometime he

was again called to the chamber, and he was seen handing

over the money to the District Registrar. The complainant

is definite in evidence that the amount of  2000/- paid by

him was accepted by the District Registrar in his right hand,

he put the currency inside a diary, and the diary containing

Crl.A No. 983 of 2007
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                                   13</span>


currency was kept in the table drawer by the accused. The

complainant identified MO2 diary during trial.         Both the

witnesses identified MO1 phenolphthalein tainted currency

seized from the possession of the accused.

</p><p id="p_11">       9.      There is absolutely no reason why the trap

witness examined as PW2 should give false evidence

against the accused. The complainant, and also the trap

witness well identified the accused as the District Registrar

who accepted illegal gratification of  2000/- from the

complainant on 13.12.2000 at his office. The complainant

stoutly denied the suggestions made by the defence that

the tainted currency was stealthily put by the complainant

in the table drawer when the District Registrar went to the

toilet. But a contradictory suggestion was made to PW2

during cross-examination. That suggestion put to PW2 in

cross-examination is that when the complainant tendered

illegal gratification, it was rejected by the District Registrar.

This suggestion put to PW2 during cross-examination by

the defence shows that          the money was not        in fact

stealthily put in the table drawer by the complainant in the

Crl.A No. 983 of 2007
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                               14</span>


absence of the accused. The definite suggestion given by

PW2 is that the tainted money was tendered to the District

Registrar by the complainant, which the District Registrar

declined. If that is the suggestion, there is no question of

the tainted money being stealthily put in the table drawer

in the absence of the accused.      This is in fact a very

damaging suggestion      which goes quite contradictory to

the other defence projected by the accused that the tainted

money was stealthily put by the complainant in the table

drawer in his absence.
</p>
<p id="p_12">       10. An important ground argued by the defence is

that Exts.P5 and P6 requests and also Ext.P7 complaint

made on 13.12.2000 are suspicious. The case of the

defence is that in Ext.P7 complaint, the complainant has

mentioned about a written request for reducing the sale

consideration, but Exts.P5 and P6 letters will show that

these were received by the District Registrar only on

13.12.2000. Ext.P7 complaint was made on 12.12.2000.

The question is as to how a written request made on

13.12.2000 happened to be mentioned in the complaint

Crl.A No. 983 of 2007
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">                                15</span>


made on 12.12.2000.      On this aspect, necessary questions

or suggestions were not put to the complainant by the

defence. The complainant identified Exts.P5 and P6 letters

as the representations made by him and his brother when

the complainant met the District Registrar in November,

2000 itself on getting Exts.P3 and P4 provisional orders. Of

course, it is true that an endorsement is seen on the top of

these two letters, bearing the date 13.12.2000.           The

defence did not put any suggestion to the complainant that

Exts.P5 and P6 are not the requests made by him, and his

brother in November, 2000.          The evidence of the

complainant shows that Exts.P5 and P6 are the written

requests made by him, and his brother in November, 2000.

These are the letters mentioned by the complainant in the

Ext.P7 complaint. Just because the District Registrar made

endorsement on these letters only on 13.12.2000, the date

on which he accepted illegal gratification, it cannot at all be

doubted that Ext.P7 complaint        mentioning these two

letters is suspicious.   The defence did not put suggestion

to the complainant that Exts.P5 and P6 letters were made

Crl.A No. 983 of 2007
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                                16</span>


or given only on 13.12.2000.        On the other hand, the

evidence given by the complainant shows that Exts.P5 and

P6    are the requests made by him, and his brother in

November 2000 after they received the provisional orders.

The only thing is that the District Registrar made

endorsement on the requests only on 13.12.2000 when he

received illegal gratification. I find absolutely nothing to

doubt Exts.P5 and P6 requests, or the Ext.P7 complaint

mentioning these requests.
</p>
<p id="p_13">       11. PW8 is the Dy.S.P (Vigilance) who laid trap in

this case on the Ext.P7 complaint made by PW1. He has

given satisfactory evidence proving the pre-trap and the

post-trap measures taken by him, including recovery of the

tainted money from the table drawer of the accused, as

seen inserted in a diary, and also the positive result of the

phenolphthalein test conducted at the time of recovery.

The accused was arrested by him on the spot. It is true

that PW2, the trap witness had not actually seen where the

money was put by the accused. His evidence is only that

when he peeped through the half door, he saw the

Crl.A No. 983 of 2007
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">                                     17</span>


complainant tendering the amount. However, his evidence

is that when the Dy.S.P asked the accused whether he had

received money from the complainant and where he had

kept it, the accused told that it was accepted by him, and

was inserted in a diary which he kept in the table drawer.

Accordingly, the said diary was taken from the table drawer

and it was found containing the phenolphthalein tainted

currency of  2000/-.I find that the evidence given by PW2,

the trap witness is totally acceptable.               As regards

acceptance, his evidence supports           the evidence of the

complainant.         The fact of recovery of the tainted money at

the instance of the accused or from his possession clearly

proves acceptance.
</p>
<p id="p_14">       12. As regards demand, there is only the evidence of

the complainant. His evidence satisfies the court that the

accused herein had made repeated demands for bribe as a

reward for giving some concession in the matter of deficit

stamp duty due on Ext.P1 and P2 documents. This evidence

given by the complainant stands not discredited in cross-

examination. There is no reason why the complainant

Crl.A No. 983 of 2007
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">                                  18</span>


should make a false complaint against the accused, or why

he and the trap witness should give false evidence against

the accused. The defence projected by the accused that the

trap in this case is illegitimate, or that it was arranged at

the instance of a political leader by making use of the

complainant who is a party supporter, stands not in any

manner proved or probabilised. This is not a case where

sanction under <a href="/doc/97670/" id="a_12">Section 19</a> of the P.C Act is required. The

evidence given by the Detecting Officer regarding the

recovery of tainted money from the possession of the

accused is well convincing and he is fully supported by

PW2, the trap witness. In so many decisions, the Hon'ble

Supreme Court has held that there cannot be a conviction

under <a href="/doc/324254/" id="a_13">Section 7</a> or 13 (2) of the <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_14">P.C Act</a>, without evidence

proving demand and acceptance.         In this case, demand

stands well proved by the evidence of the complainant,

which is not tainted with any doubt or suspicious

circumstance.        The fact of acceptance of bribe by the

accused stands well proved by the evidence of the

complainant, and also the evidence of the trap witness.

Crl.A No. 983 of 2007
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">                                    19</span>


Acceptance of the tainted money is further proved by the

evidence proving recovery of the tainted money from the

possession of the accused.
</p>
<p id="p_15">       13.       It is settled that recovery of tainted money

from the possession of the accused will not by itself make

him liable for the offence under <a href="/doc/324254/" id="a_15">Section 7</a> or 13 (2) of the

<a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_16">P.C Act</a>. But here, besides the evidence proving recovery

there is the definite and consistent evidence given by the

complainant and the trap witness proving the essentials to

constitute the offences alleged. I find that the prosecution

has well succeeded in proving the guilt of the accused, that

he had accepted an amount of  2000/- from PW1 as

alleged by the prosecution as a reward for giving some

concession in the matter of deficit stamp duty on Exts.P1

and P2 documents by which the complainant and his

brother purchased properties. The amount proposed by the

Sub Registrar is in fact the actual amount of consideration

paid by the complainant and his brother. He has stated in

the complaint itself that the actual consideration for Ext.P1

sale is  60,000/- and the actual consideration of Ext.P2

Crl.A No. 983 of 2007
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">                                 20</span>

sale is  40,000/-. Exts.P9 and P10 documents containing

the endorsements made by the accused in his own

handwriting proves that he made such orders granting

concession in the matter of deficit stamp duty after

receiving the amount of  2000/- from the complainant.

</p><p id="p_16">       14. It is well settled that once acceptance of illegal

gratification is proved, the court is bound to apply the

presumption under <a href="/doc/1005555/" id="a_17">Section 20</a> (1) of the <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_18">P.C Act</a>. Here is

such a case where such presumption can well be applied,

that the amount of  2000/- recovered from the accused as

tainted money, was in fact accepted by him as a reward for

making the Exts.P9 and P10 endorsements to the benefit of

the complainant and his brother. The accused has no

explanation whatever why he received the tainted money

from the complainant, or in what circumstance he received

the said amount, or in what circumstance the amount

happened to be recovered from his possession. As already

stated, the accused has put forward       two contradictory

defences. Of course, it is true that the accused can plead

ill-consistent defences, but when one defence pleaded by

Crl.A No. 983 of 2007
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">                                  21</span>


the accused totally contradicts and damages the other

defence, it cannot be said to be a case of inconsistent

defence.         One defence projected by the accused during

trial is that the complainant stealthily put the tainted

money in his table drawer when the accused went to the

bath room. Another defence projected through PW2 is that

when the complainant tendered the tainted money, the

accused declined and warded it off, as a result of which

probably traces of phenolphthalein powder came on his

hands, giving positive result. Thus, I find that the accused

does not have any acceptable defence in this case, and

there is absolutely nothing       rebutting the presumption

against him under <a href="/doc/1005555/" id="a_19">Section 20</a> (1) of the <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_20">P.C Act</a>.

</p><p id="p_17">       15. On an appreciation of the entire evidence as

discussed above, I find that the prosecution case stands

well proved in this case. The evidence given by the other

witnesses like PW3 and PW4 is not very much important.

These witnesses only produced some documents             like

attendance register and other registers proving the official

position of the accused as District Registrar, and also

Crl.A No. 983 of 2007
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">                                  22</span>


proving that he was on duty in the office on the date of

trap. The accused does not have any dispute on these

aspects.       So these registers, or the evidence given those

witnesses need not be discussed in detail.

</p><p id="p_18">       16. In view of the findings above, this appeal is

liable to be dismissed, confirming the conviction against

the appellant under <a href="/doc/324254/" id="a_21">Sections 7</a> and <a href="/doc/178303/" id="a_22">13</a> (2) read with <a href="/doc/178303/" id="a_23">Section

13</a> (1) (d) of the <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_24">P.C Act</a>. The sentence imposed by the

court below is rigorous imprisonment for two years each,

and a fine of  5000/- each under <a href="/doc/324254/" id="a_25">Sections 7</a> and <a href="/doc/178303/" id="a_26">13</a> (2)

read with 13 (1) (d) of the <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_27">P.C Act</a>. When the seriousness of

the crime is considered, one would not say that            the

sentence is harsh or unreasonable.         But in the present

circumstances where the accused must be now aged 70

years, I feel it appropriate to make some interference in

the matter of sentence to modify and reduce the

substantive sentence. On a consideration of the amount of

bribe involved, the age of the accused at present, and also

the trauma of prosecution undergone by the accused for

the last 15 years, I feel that the minimum sentence possible

Crl.A No. 983 of 2007
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">                                   23</span>


as on the date of commission of the offence will be the

adequate sentence in this case. After the 2014 amendment

to the <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_28">P.C Act</a>, the minimum sentence prescribed under

<a href="/doc/324254/" id="a_29">Section 7</a> of the P.C Act is imprisonment for three years,

and the minimum sentence prescribed under <a href="/doc/1259316/" id="a_30">Section 13(2)</a>

of the P.C Act is imprisonment for four years.         But as on

the date of commission of the alleged offence in this case,

the minimum sentence prescribed under <a href="/doc/324254/" id="a_31">Section 7</a> of the

P.C Act was imprisonment for six months, and the minimum

sentence prescribed under <a href="/doc/178303/" id="a_32">Section 13</a> (2) of the <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_33">P.C Act</a> was

imprisonment for one year. Considering the advanced age

of the accused now, I feel it appropriate to modify the

sentence, and make it simple imprisonment. Thus, I find

that simple imprisonment for six months under <a href="/doc/324254/" id="a_34">Section 7</a> of

the P.C Act and simple imprisonment for one year under

<a href="/doc/178303/" id="a_35">Section 13</a> (2) read with <a href="/doc/178303/" id="a_36">Section 13</a> (1) (d of the Act will be

just, reasonable and adequate sentence.
</p>
<p id="p_19">        In the result, this appeal is allowed in part to the very

limited extent of modifying and reducing the substantive

sentence. The conviction made by the trial court against

the appellant in C.C 8 of 2002 will stand confirmed.

However, the substantive sentence will stand modified and

reduced to simple imprisonment for six months under

<a href="/doc/324254/" id="a_37">Section 7</a> of the P.C Act, and to simple imprisonment for

one year under <a href="/doc/178303/" id="a_38">Section 13</a> (2) read with 13 (1) (d) of the

<a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_39">P.C Act</a>. The two sentences will run concurrently. The fine

sentence imposed by the trial court with the default

sentence thereon is maintained subject to the modification

that the default sentence shall be simple in nature.
