<pre id="pre_1">*    IN THE HIGH COURT OF DELHI AT NEW DELHI

+    RFA 487/1971

     LT. COL. HARI CHAND                  ..... Appellant
               Through: Mr.Manmohan Gupta, Adv.

                  versus

     UOI                                ..... Respondent
                  Through: Mr.Sanjay Poddar, Adv.

                       DATE OF DECISION:
%                         04.09.2008

     CORAM:
     HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE PRADEEP NANDRAJOG
     HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE SUNIL GAUR

1.   Whether reporters of local papers may be allowed
     to see the judgment?

2.   To be referred to the Reporter or not?

3.   Whether judgment should be reported in Digest?

:    PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J.(Oral)

CM No.548/1979, CM No.11720/2006, CM No.11719/2006
&amp; CM No.11721/2006

1.         Vide CM No.11720/006 condonation of delay in filing

CM No.11719/2006 has been prayed.

2.         Vide CM No.11719/2006 restoration of the appeal

has been prayed for.       Vide CM No.11721/2006 revival of CM

No.548/1979 has been prayed for.

3.         Vide CM No.548/1979 substitution of the legal heirs

of the deceased appellant has been prayed for. We note that



RFA No.487/1971                                     Page No.1 of 7
 the appellant Hari Chand died on 6.2.1979.

4.         When appellant died CM No.548/1979 was filed.

Claim for substitution was predicated on a stated will dated

28.7.1974 purportedly executed by the appellant.          The will

came under a cloud. Probate of the will was sought for. On

15.5.1981 hearing of CM No.548/1979 was deferred sine-die

for the reason the Probate Court was seized of the dispute.

5.         The appeal came to be listed before Court on

24.9.1992. The appeal was dismissed noting that none

appeared and even paper book was not filed.

6.         Everyone went into a slumber till September, 2006

when CM No.11719-20-21/2006 were filed.

7.         Prayers made in the 3 applications have been noted

hereinabove.

8.         It was pointed out to this Court that after fighting for

years together the parties settled the dispute relating to the

probate of the will and that the probate petition was disposed

of as per consent, vide order dated 1.3.2006.         As per the

settlement, the amount of compensation, if any enhanced,

was to be shared amongst Shri Chander Bal Dhawan, Shri Ram

Prakash Mehra, Shri Chander Kumar Mehra and Shri Som Nath

Mehra in the ratio : " 50 : 16.6 : 16.6 : 16.6", meaning thereby

Chander Bal Dhawan would get 50% of the enhanced

RFA No.487/1971                                        Page No.2 of 7
 compensation and the remaining 3 would get remaining 50%

to be equally divided inter se the 3.

9.            Explaining delay in seeking revival of the appeal, it

is stated that the parties were under the impression that

pursuant to the order dated 15.5.1981 hearing of the appeal

was adjourned sine die till dispute before the Probate Court

was decided and that when dispute before the Probate Court

was decided the parties sought inspection of the appeal and

thereupon learnt that the same was dismissed in default on

24.9.1992.

10.           We are satisfied that the applicants had a sufficient

cause    in    belatedly   preferring   the   application   seeking

restoration.

12.           We thus dispose of the applications as follows:-

A.)   CM No.548/1979, CM No.11721/2006 are disposed of by

impleading        Shri Chander Bal Dhawan, Shri Ram Prakash

Mehra, Shri Chander Kumar Mehra and Shri Som Nath Mehra

as the legal heirs of the deceased appellant.

      Amended memo of parties is directed to be filed within a

week.

B.)   CM No.11720/2006 is allowed.            Delay in filing CM

No.11719/2006 is condoned.

C)    CM No.11719/2006 is allowed.         Order dated 24.9.1992

RFA No.487/1971                                         Page No.3 of 7
 dismissing the appeal in default is set aside.      The appeal is

restored for hearing.

RFA No.487/1971

1.         Learned counsel for the parties state that the

printing of the record for preparation of the appeal paper book

may be dispensed with.

2.         Ordered accordingly.

3.         Heard learned counsel for the parties.

4.         Late Lt. Col. Hari Chand owned 2 bigha and 1 biswa

of land comprised in Khasra No.132 in the revenue estate of

Village Kalu Sarai. He also owned 7 bigha and 19 biswa of land

comprised in Khasra No.285/133 in the revenue estate of the

same Village.

5.         Pursuant to a notification issued under <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_1">Section 4</a> of

the Land Acquisition Act 1894 on 25.8.1962, the said land

came to be acquired vide Award No.1462.

6.         Dissatisfied with the award, Lt. Col. Hari Chand

sought a reference under <a href="/doc/1517117/" id="a_2">Section 18</a> of the L.A. Act, 1894.

Vide impugned judgment       and   decree dated 7.5.1971 the

Reference Court enhanced the compensation for the land

comprised in Khasra No.132 by determining fair market value

thereof @ Rs.24.20 per sq. yd. and for the land comprised in

Khasra No.285/133 @ Rs.15.12 per sq. yd.

RFA No.487/1971                                       Page No.4 of 7
 7.         In the appeal, late Lt. Col. Hari Chand prayed that

the compensation be further enhanced by Rs.6,40,000/-.

8.         Learned counsel for the parties state that this Court

need not bother itself much with the evidence led and may

dispose of the appeal with reference to a decision of the co-

ordinate Division Bench of this Court reported as 45 (1991)

DLT 131 (DB) Hans Raj Bhalla Vs. UOI.

9.         We have perused the decision in Hans Raj Bhalla's

case. Subject matter of the decision was the determination of

fair compensation of land in the same village i.e. Kalu Sarai

relatable to a notification under <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_3">Section 4</a> of the Land

Acquisition Act on 3.8.1963.

10.        With reference to an earlier decision of this Court,

where, pertaining to a notification dated 13.11.1959 issued

under <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_4">Section 4</a> of the LA Act, 1894 for lands in Village Kalu

Sarai, fair compensation as of 13.11.1959 was assessed at

Rs.17,000/- per bigha for all lands, the Division Bench

enhanced the      compensation   to   Rs.22,000/-   per   bigha

pertaining to the lands acquired pursuant to the notification

dated 3.8.1963.

11.        The principle adopted by this Court was to treat

Rs.17,000/- per bigha as fair market compensation as of

13.11.1959 and suitably enhance the same as time passed by.

RFA No.487/1971                                     Page No.5 of 7
 12.         We do likewise.     Learned counsel for the parties

state that treating Rs.17,000/- per bigha as fair market value

as of 13.11.1959 and pegging the same at Rs.22,000/- per

month as of 3.8.1963, yearly increase comes to approximately

Rs.1000/- per bigha.

13.         Thus, we determine fair market value of the

acquired lands as of 25.8.1962 at Rs.21,000/- per bigha.

14.         Noting that the acquisition proceedings commenced

and came to an end prior to 30.4.1982 we note that the issue

has to be decided in light of the provisions of the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_5">Land

Acquisition Act</a>, 1894 as in vogue prior to the amendments

incorporated therein.

15.         This would mean that <a href="/doc/158228882/" id="a_6">Section 25</a> of the Land

Acquisition Act, 1894 would have to be taken note of as on the

statute book prior to its amendment in the year 1984.

16.         We note that the deceased Lt. Col. Hari Chand was not

served with a notice under <a href="/doc/1990166/" id="a_7">Section 9</a> of the LA Act, 1894 and for said

reason could not submit any claim before the Land Acquisition

Collector, meaning thereby, the bar of the unamended <a href="/doc/158228882/" id="a_8">Section 25</a>

would not come into force.

17.         There is no embargo on enhancing the compensation as

directed.

18.         Relatable to the benefit under <a href="/doc/1945807/" id="a_9">Section 28</a>, learned



RFA No.487/1971                                          Page No.6 of 7
 counsel for the parties concede that due to the negligent acts of the

legal heirs of the appellant it may be recorded that they would not

be entitled to any interest on the enhanced compensation under

<a href="/doc/1945807/" id="a_10">Section 28</a> of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 for the period

15.5.1981 till 17.4.2006.

19.        We further direct that the statutory benefits granted by

the learned Reference Court at the rate specified in para 17 of the

impugned order, relatable to the compensation which stands

enhanced today, would not be available to the appellants for the

period 15.5.1981 till 17.4.2006 as conceded by learned counsel for

the appellants.

20.        Appellants would be entitled to proportionate court fee on

the enhanced compensation.
