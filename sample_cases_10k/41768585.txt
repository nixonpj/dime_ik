         Morbi, District: Morbi.
</p>

<p id="p_5">         3.2      On 26th September, 2014, at around 7:00 O' clock in
         the evening, the writ applicant and his nephew, namely,
         Rajeshbhai Thakarshibhai Kaundra (deceased) were returning
         to their village in their respective bullock carts. The writ
         applicant was in the front riding his bullock cart and his
         nephew was following him riding his own bullock cart. It is his
         case that a white coloured Tata Indica Car came from behind in
         full speed and rammed into the bullock cart of his nephew. The
         impact was so severe that the nephew died on the spot. On
         account of the severe impact, the bullock cart of the deceased
         fell on the bullock cart of the writ applicant. The writ applicant
         got flung on one side of the road resulting in grievous injuries
         on his head, elbow, leg and hip. It is the case of the writ
         applicant that he witnessed the driver of the Indica Car,
         namely, Dilipbhai Maganbhai Gambhva getting out of the car.
         The colleague of Dilipbhai Maganbhai Gambhva, namely,
         Jagdishbhai      @         Vishal   Mansukhbhai             Kasundra,           who        was
         travelling in the car also came out. The writ applicant
         requested both to help him as he had sustained severe
         injuries, whereas the nephew was found to be dead. However,
         instead of helping the writ applicant and calling for                                          the
         medical aid, both ran away from the spot of the accident. The
         writ applicant, thereafter, somehow, was able to call up his son
         , who arrived at the spot of the accident with an ambulance.
         The writ applicant was admitted in the hospital at Morbi. The
         nephew passed away on account of the severe head injuries.

         register the first information report. It is the case of the writ
         applicant that although he had narrated the exact event, yet
         the police, for some reason or the other, noted in the first
         information report that a truck had a head on collision, first
         with the bullock cart of the writ applicant and, thereafter, with
         the bullock cart of the deceased. The first informant has
         levellled serious allegations that his signature on the first
         information report is not genuine and has been forged.
</p>

<p id="p_7">         3.4         He preferred a detailed representation in this regard
         dated 12th October, 2014 addressed to the Police Sub-Inspector
         of the Morbi Police Station and a copy of the same was
         forwarded to the Deputy Inspector General of Police, Rajkot,
         District Superintendent of Police, Morbi and the Home Minister
         of    the    State          of   Gujarat.      Despite         various          vociferous
         representations before the various authorities, none paid heed
         and the investigation was hushed up and the charge-sheet
         came to be filed on 31st January, 2015 for the offence
         punishable under <a href="/doc/1270101/" id="a_2">sections 279</a>, <a href="/doc/278610/" id="a_3">339</a>, <a href="/doc/1721129/" id="a_4">338</a>, <a href="/doc/1371604/" id="a_5">304-A</a> and <a href="/doc/3563/" id="a_6">429</a> of the
         Indian Penal Code. It is, for the first time, when the charge-
         sheet came to be filed, that the writ applicant learnt that the
         driver of the vehicle was shown to be one Hareshbhai
         Dayabhai Bhimani, i.e., the maternal uncle of Dilipbhai
         Maganbhai Gambhva, the person who was actually driving the
         Tata Indica Car.
</p>

<p id="p_8">         3.5   it is the case of the writ applicant that Hareshbhai
         Dayabhai Bhimani has nothing to do with the matter and was
         not even present. The police further came out with a case that
         along with the driver, there were three persons sitting in the
         car, but, in fact, there were only two persons in the car, i.e.,

         Dilipbhai Maganbhai Gambhva, the driver and Jagdishbhai @
         Vishal Mansukhbhai Kasundra.
</p>

<p id="p_9">         3.6   It is the case of the writ applicant that Dilipbhai
         Maganbhai Gambhva, somehow managed with the police to
         save himself from the penal liability, and the police, in
         collusion and connivance with Dilipbhai Maganbhai Gambhva,
         showed Hareshbhai Dayabhai Bhimani as the actual driver of
         the car, which met with the accident.
</p>

<p id="p_10">         3.7   It is also alleged that Dilipbhai Maganbhai Gambhva has
         no driving license and, probably, for such reason, he managed
         with the police.
</p>

<p id="p_11">         3.8      In such circumstances referred to above, the writ
         applicant prays that in the interest of justice, let there be a
         further investigation or a re-investigation so as to book the real
         culprit responsible for the accident, which caused the death of
         an innocent young boy.
</p>

<p id="p_12">         4.    Mr. C.P. Chaniyara, the learned counsel appearing for the
         writ applicant submitted that the case at hand is very serious.
         If the real culprit, with the aid of muscle power, money power
         or position, is able to save himself from the penal liability by
         showing an altogether a different person responsible for the
         accident, then, that would be nothing but travesty of justice.
         He pointed out that the vehicular accidents in the State are
         increasing day by day. The drivers who are rash, reckless and
         negligent, should not be allowed to go scott free and they
         should be put to trial in accordance with law. He would submit
         that it was not expected of the Investigating Officer to hush up

         the investigation and show an altogether a different person as
         the driver, whereas that person was not even present at the
         spot of the accident. In such circumstances, the learned
         counsel prays that this is a fit case for reinvestigation or
         further investigation.
</p>

<p id="p_13">         5.   On the other hand, this writ application has been
         vehemently opposed by the learned APP appearing for the
         respondents.        The    learned    APP       would        submit         that          the
         investigation has been carried out in a fair and transparent
         manner and the allegations, which have been levelled by the
         writ applicant, are not correct. The learned APP has placed
         reliance on the affidavit filed by the Investigating Officer,
         namely, Salimbhai Ajijbhai Makrani. In the affidavit-in-reply, it
         has been stated that;

         relevant documents which deals with the controversy
         raised in the petition.
</p>

<p id="p_15">         4.    The Petitioners herein have invoked extra ordinary
         writ jurisdiction of this Hon'ble Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_7">Article 226</a> of
         the Constitution of India and have prayed for issuance of
         appropriate Writ, order or direction to respondent no.3
         herein to reinvestigate in I CR no. 111/2014 registered
         with the Morbi Taluka Police station and by another
         officer. That direction is also sought for to investigate this
         Offence in fair manner by adding the name of real driver.
         The Petitioner has also prayed for direction to respondent
         no.3 herein that the investigation may be supervise by
         some higher officer superior to rank of the investigating
         officer.
</p>

<p id="p_16">               The gist of the submissions of the petitioner is that
         right from inception, the investigation is faulty in as
         much as that in the FIR the investigating officer in
         connivance with the driver Dilipbhai Maganbhai
         Gambhva, has recorded that the accident had occurred
         with truck whereas the correct fact is that the accident
         had occurred with the Indica car. Secondly, it is the case
         of the petitioner that signature in the complaint is not of
         the complainant. The petitioner had further alleged that
         the petitioner had brought to the notice of investigating
         officer the correct facts of the accident however, when
         they saw charge sheet they realized that the vehicle
         involved is changed from truck to Indica car and further
         has changed the name of driver Dilipbhai Maganbhai
         Gambhva to Hareshbhai Dayabhai Bhimani. It is
         incorrectly mentioned in the charge sheet that there
         were three persons in the car whereas there were only
         two persons. That it is further alleged that the main
         reason for change of driver is that the actual driver is not
         having any driving license.
</p><p id="p_17">         5.    At the out set, I humbly say and submit that the
         stand of the petitioner who is the original complainant
         has not remained stable. That the investigation has been
         done on the direction from the facts Which had been
         gathered from the original complainant- petitioner as he
         is the sole eye witness to the incident. I strongly deny
         that the investigation is not done in fair manner. I crave
         leave of this Hon'ble Court to bring on record relevant

              herein humbly urges to the Hon'ble Court that the during
              course of investigation, the complainant has not
              cooperated in the investigation. That the investigating
              officer had called on his mobile no. 9979566028 to come
              forward with any material which he propose to rely upon
              when he has stated that my application is my evidence.
              That the said fact is also recorded in the station diary by
              the investigating officer on 09.11.2014 at around 13/15
              Hrs. That the investigating officer has also inquired from
              private sources and it is learnt that in the past there is
              political dispute going on between two families of
              Kasundra and Gambhva family. It may kindly be
              appreciated that right from the beginning the
              complainant has not remained firm in his stand. firstly it
              was reported that the accident has occurred with truck
              and when complaint was registered it was reported that
              accident had occurred with the Ind1ca car and also given
              names of persons present and had specifically stated
              that car was driven by Hareshbhai and now he is alleging
              that the car was driven by Dilipbhai Gambhva. In these
              facts and circumstances, the complainant say is not
              reliable, more particularly when right in inception the
              complainant was not aware that whether the accident
              had occurred with the truck or car. The           deponent
              therefore, humbly urges to the Hon'ble Court to not to
              entertain the afore said numbered petition."

<p id="p_24">         6.   In view of the above, the learned APP prays that there
         being no merit in this writ application, the same be rejected.

<p id="p_25">         7.   Having heard the learned counsel appearing for the
         parties and having considered the materials on record, the
         only question that falls for my consideration is whether the writ

<p id="p_26">         8.   <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_16">Article 21</a> guarantees fair trial. A fair trial is impossible if
         there is no fair investigation. In order to be a fair investigation,

         the investigation must be conducted thoroughly, without bias
         or prejudice, without any ulterior motive and every fact,
         surfacing during the course of investigation, which may have a
         bearing on the outcome of the investigation and, eventually,
         on the trial, must be recorded contemporaneously by the
         Investigating        Officer      at     the       time        of     investigation.             A
         manipulated         investigation         or    an       investigation,            which         is
         motivated, cannot lead to a fair trial. Necessary, therefore, it is
         that the Courts are vigilant, for, it is as much the duty of the
         Court commencing from the level of the Judicial Magistrate to
         ensure that an investigation conducted is proper and fair as it
         is the duty of the Investigating Officer to ensure that an
         investigation conducted is proper and fair. A fair investigation
         would     include           a   complete           investigation.            A      complete
         investigation would mean an investigation, which looks into all
         the aspects of an accusation, be it in favour of the accused or
         against him.
</p>

<p id="p_27">         9.   <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_17">Article 21</a>, undoubtedly, vests in every accused the right
         to demand a fair trial. This right, which is fundamental in
         nature, casts a corresponding duty, on the part of the State, to
         ensure a fair trial. If the State is to ensure a fair trial, it must
         ensure a fair investigation. Logically extended, this would
         mean that every victim of offence has the right to demand a
         fair trial meaning thereby that he or she has the right to
         demand that the State discharges its Constitutional obligation
         to conduct a fair investigation so that the investigation
         culminates into fair trial. The State has, therefore, the duty to
         ensure that every investigation, conducted by its chosen
         agency, is not motivated, reckless and that the Investigating
         Officer acts in due obedience to law. It is only when the State

         ensures that the investigation is fair, can it (the State) be able
         to say, when questioned, that the trial conducted was a fair
         trial. <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_18">Article 21</a>, therefore, does not vest in only an accused the
         right to demand fair trial, but it also vests an equally important
         right, fundamental in nature, in the victim, to demand a fair
         trial. <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_19">Article 21</a> does not, thus, confer fundamental right on the
         accused alone, but it also confers, on the victim of an offence,
         the right, fundamental in nature, to demand fair trial. When
         police registers a case, the State assumes the responsibility of
         conducting an investigation. Having assumed the responsibility
         of investigating the truth or veracity of the allegations, which
         the   police    receive,   the    State      cannot          act,      nor      can        its
         Investigating agency act, without a sense of impartiality. It is
         not merely a trial, which has to be impartial. No less important
         it is that the investigation, too, is impartial. Fairness of trial will
         carry with it the fairness of investigation and fairness of
         investigation will carry with it the impartiality in investigation,
         besides the investigation being efficient, un-biased, not aimed
         at helping either the prosecution or the defence. In short, an
         investigation must not suffer from any ulterior motive or
         hidden agenda to either help a person or harm a person. This
         is the principle, which <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_20">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India,
         read with <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_21">Article 14</a> thereof, enshrines, when we say that our
         Constitution guarantees fair trial.
</p>

<p id="p_28">         10.   The alleged violation of the above stated principles is at
         the heart of the controversy in the present writ application.

<p id="p_29">         11.   I am at one with the learned counsel appearing for the

         put up by the writ applicant. There is no good reason worth the
         name for the first informant to falsely involve or implicate
         Dilipbhai Maganbhai Gambhva as an accused. The case of the
         writ applicant is plain and simple. According to him, although
         he narrated the exact event before the police, yet the police,
         for some reason or the other, changed the version and has
         shown one Hareshbhai Dayabhai Bhimani as the person who
         was on wheels at the time of the accident. I am convinced that
         the investigation has been carried out in a most perfunctory
         manner and the real culprit has been protected for some
         extraneous considerations. Hareshbhai Dayabhai Bhimani, the
         matrimonial uncle of Dilipbhai Maganbhai Gambhva, for some
         reason, might have agreed to shoulder the liability, but the
         court will not permit both Hareshbhai Dayabhai Bhimani and
         Dilipbhai Maganbhai Gambhva to make a mockery of the
         investigation and justice.
</p>

<p id="p_30">         12.   I am told that Dilipbhai Maganbhai Gambhva, the person
         who was on wheels and was found to be driving in full speed,
         has no driving license and, probably, for such reason, he could
         manage or convince his matrimonial uncle to take the liability
         on his head. This is not one such incident, which has come to
         the notice of this Court. In the past also, it came to the notice
         of this Court that by sheer power of money and position, the
         rash and negligent drivers are able to manage with the police
         and at the end of it, an innocent person is fastened with the
         liability. That innocent person is either won over by money or
         pressure or by any other illegal means. At any cost, this should
         not happen and such an act should be dealt with very
         seriously.</p><pre id="pre_3">

         the first information report has not been taken down correctly

         a detailed representation in this regard bringing all the
         relevant facts to the notice of the higher authorities, none paid

               The driver of the car, namely, Dilipbhai Maganbhai
               Gambhva, residing in Diamond Nagar (Amran Village) got
               down from the driver's side of the car. One another
               person, namely, Jagdishbhai Mansukhbhai Kasundra also
               of the same village got out of the car from the
               passenger's side. I requested Dilipbhai Maganbhai
               Gambhva to help us, but he did not provide any help to
               me and my nephew Rajeshbhai. Rajeshbhai died on the
               spot of the accident. I had to be hospitalized for couple of
               days.

<p id="p_34">                     Therefore, I want to state by this application that
               the vehicle that met with accident was being driven by
               Dilipbhai Maganbhai Gambhva himself which I state vide
               this application. I have suspicion that preparation is
               being made to substitute some other driver in place of
               Dilipbhai who was driving the car. I have got confirmed
               portend and I believe that to cover up this accident, a
               false story is being put up that some other vehicle from
               the opposite side had collided in the accident. Despite
               lapse of 17 days since the said accident took place no
               satisfactory action has been taken. I therefore request

         account of the political dispute going on between the two
         families, i.e., Kasundra and Gambhva respectively. Why should
         a person exonerate the real culprit and involved an innocent
         man in the accident. Even an illiterate person will be able to
         make out whether the vehicle is a truck or a car. A person may
         not be able to identify the make of the car, but, at least, he
         would know the difference between a truck and a car.
         Ultimately, at the end of the investigation, the investigating
         officer had to accept that it was a car who met with an
         accident with the two bullock carts. The registration number of
         the car in question is GJ-10-AP-1678. Hareshbhai Dayabhai
         Bhimani, who is shown as the accused, is not even the
         registered owner of this vehicle. There does not seem to be
         any investigation, if at all, it is believed, for the time being,
         that it was Hareshbhai Dayabhai Bhimani, who was driving the

         'investigation' conducted was not proper or mala fide and
         when, in such a situation, the State Government entrusts the
         case for 'investigation' to its any other or superior agency,
         such as the Criminal Investigation Department (in short, 'the
         CID'), such an "investigation‟ can be regarded as 'further
         investigation' and not 're-investigation', for, the police and the
         CID come under one and the same Government. However, on
         completion of the 'investigation' by the local police or the CID
         or without completion thereof, an 'investigation' is commenced
         by an agency, say for instance by the Central Bureau of
         Investigation (i.e., CBI), which comes under an authority, which
         is distinct and different from the State Government, it becomes
         a case of „re-investigation‟. (See State of Andhra Pradesh Vs.
         A.S. Peter, reported in (2008) 2 SCC 383).
</p>

<p id="p_41">         17. What is also important to bear in mind is that a further
         investigation is neither a 'fresh investigation' nor it is 're-
         investigation'. A "further investigation‟ really means an
         additional 'investigation', for, it is a continuation of the earlier
         'investigation' and not a 'fresh' or re-investigation, which starts
         ab initio, though the materials, which may have surfaced and
         unearthed during earlier investigation, may be taken into
         account     by      the    officer    or        the     investigating             agency
         conducting ,re-investigation‟. The distinction between 'fresh
         investigation, and ,re-investigation‟, on the one hand, and
         'further investigation', on the other, has been dealt with, and
         succinctly described, in A. Chandrasekhar Vs. State of Kerala,
         reported in (1998) 5 SCC 223, wherein an investigation, was
         conducted by the CBI, but the State withdrew its consent given

         question arose as to whether the withdrawal of consent by the
         State was permissible? This question was answered in the
         negative. While holding that the 'investigation' must be
         directed to be completed by the CBI, the Supreme Court drew
         the   distinction          between       're-investigation'               and         fresh
         'investigation' in the following words:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_12">               "24. From a plain reading of the above section it is
               evident that even after submission of police report under
               sub-section (2) on completion of „investigation‟, the
               police has a right of "further" ,investigation‟ under sub-
               section (8) but not "fresh 'investigation' or "re-
               investigation‟". That the Government of Kerala was also
               conscious of this position is evident from the fact that
               though initially it stated in the Explanatory Note of their
               notification dated 27-6-1996 (quoted earlier) that the
               consent was being withdrawn in public interest to order a
               "re-investigation‟ of the case by a special team of State
               police officers, in the amendatory notification (quoted
               earlier) it made it clear that they wanted a "further
               investigation‟ of the case" instead of "re-investigation‟
               of the case". The dictionary meaning of "further" (when
               used     as   an     adjective)    is   "additional;  more;
               supplemental". "Further" 'investigation' therefore is the
               continuation of the earlier 'investigation' and not a fresh
               'investigation' or 're-investigation' to be started ab initio
               wiping out the earlier „investigation‟ altogether. In
               drawing this conclusion we have also drawn inspiration
               from the fact that sub-section (8) clearly envisages that
               on completion of 'further investigation' the investigating
               agency has to forward to the Magistrate a "further"
               report or reports-and not fresh report or reports --
               regarding the "further" evidence obtained during such
               'investigation'. Once it is accepted -- and it has got to be
               accepted in view of the judgment in Kazi Lhendup Dorji --</blockquote>

               completed, notwithstanding withdrawal of the consent,

              into the case. To put it differently, if any 'further
              investigation‟ is to be made it is the CBI alone which can
              do so, for it was entrusted to investigate into the case by
              the State Government. Resultantly, the notification
              issued withdrawing the consent to enable the State
              Police to further investigate into the case is patently
              invalid and unsustainable in law. In view of this finding of
              ours we need not go into the questions, whether <a href="/doc/141478/" id="a_24">Section
              21</a> of the General Clauses Act applies to the consent
              given under <a href="/doc/865156/" id="a_25">Section 6</a> of the Act and whether consent
              given for investigating into Crime No. 246 of 1994 was
              redundant in view of the general consent earlier given by
              the State of Kerala." [Emphasis added].

         (2008) 2 SCC 383, it was pointed out that it was not correct to
         contend that the 'investigation‟, when handed over to the CID,
         was an 'investigation‟ by a different agency, for, points out the
         Supreme Court, in A.S. Peter (supra), the CID is a part of the
         investigating authorities of the same State and it was,
         therefore, permissible for the higher authority of the State to
         direct 'further investigation‟ by the CID. Reliance, in this
         regard, has been placed by the Supreme Court, in A.S. Peter

         initio in nature wiping out the earlier investigation altogether.
         In other words, a 'further investigation‟ is the continuation of
         the earlier investigation, which commences by virtue of the

         further ;police report(s)‟ as the police or the investigating

         results into filing of further or additional „police report‟ under
         <a href="/doc/147367599/" id="a_30">Section      173(8)</a>,         're-investigation'        or     'fresh       investigation‟

         Courts have been vested with the extraordinary powers of
         judicial review and supervision to ensure that the rights of the
         citizen are duly protected. It is in this light that the Court held,
         in Babubhai Jamnadas Patel (supra), that in an appropriate
         case, the High Court has the power to not only direct the
         'further   investigation‟,      but     even       'monitor‟           the      progress
         thereof.   The      case   of   Babubhai           Jamnadas           Patel       (supra)
         recognizes the High Court's power to direct investigation de
         novo too. Babubhai Jamnadas Patel's case (supra), is not a
         case relating to Court's power to direct further investigation at
         post cognizance stage. The relevant observations, appearing,
         in para 37, 38 and 39, in Babubhai Jamnadas Patel (supra) read
         as under :

<blockquote id="blockquote_14">              "37. The courts, and in particular the High Courts and the
              Supreme Court, are the sentinels of justice and have
              been vested with extraordinary powers of judicial review
              and supervision to ensure that the rights of the citizens
              are duly protected. The courts have to maintain a
              constant vigil against the inaction of the authorities in
              discharging their duties and obligations in the interest of
              the citizens for whom they exist. This Court, as also the
              High Courts, have had to issue appropriate writs and
              directions from time to time to ensure that the
              authorities performed at least such duties as they were
              required to perform under the various statutes and
              orders passed by the administration. As for example, in
              the instant case, the High Court had to repeatedly
              intervene and pass orders to ensure that the
              investigation was being conducted diligently. Periodical
              status reports were required in that regard. In fact, the
              High Court had to direct the Additional Public Prosecutor
              to ask the investigating officer to incorporate the details
              of the action taken by him from the date of receipt of the
              letter (sic order) dated 5-12-2008. There is little doubt
              that only after the High Court began monitoring the
              progress of the investigation that the investigating
              authorities began to deal with the matter with some
              amount of seriousness.

</p><p id="p_48">                 38. We are unable to agree with Mr. Nariman that the
                 High Court in the name of investigation directed both the
                 manner and mode in which the investigation was to be
                 conducted or the direction in which the investigation was
                 to proceed. It is because of the tardy progress of the
                 investigation that the High Court had to step in at the
                 inistance of the respondents herein. It was at the
                 instance of the State of Gujrat, which filed Special
                 Criminal Application No. 1061 of 2008 on 2nd June, 2008,
                 before the High Court, that a direction was issued to the
                 Investigating Authorities to register the complaint on
                 11th August, 2008, by way of FIR No. 187 of 2008.
</p>
<p id="p_49">                 39. The various decisions cited by Mr Dave endorse the
                 view that when required not only could the High Court or
                 this Court direct the investigating agencies to conduct
                 the investigation in a fair and unbiased manner, but that
                 in exercise of its powers under <a href="/doc/500307/" id="a_33">Article 142</a> of the
                 Constitution, the Supreme Court could also issue
                 directions for enforcement of fundamental rights and to
                 ensure that complete justice was done to the parties. In
                 fact, in Kashmeri Devi case4 this Court had directed the
                 Magistrate to exercise powers under <a href="/doc/274924/" id="a_34">Section 173(8)</a> CrPC
                 to direct CBI to make a proper and thorough investigation
                 in an independent and objective manner and to submit
                 an additional charge-sheet, if circumstances so required,
                 in accordance with law."
</p>

<p id="p_50">         21.     The High Court, in an appropriate case like the one at
         hand, may be justified in invoking its extraordinary jurisdiction
         under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_35">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India to direct either
         'further investigation' or 're-investigation' in a case. (see <a href="/doc/57841497/" id="a_36">State

<p id="p_54">         23.   "Further investigation‟ is nothing, but continuation of an
         earlier investigation. In "further investigation‟, thus, the
         investigation, which might have been conducted in the past,
         would be resumed and conducted further.
</p>


<p id="p_55">         24.   As against "further investigation‟, a "re-investigation‟ is
         an investigation, which is a new and fresh investigation wiping
         out   the     earlier      investigation         and       "re-investigation‟                is
         conducted by an agency, which is not only different from the
         earlier investigating agency, but also must be one, which falls
         under the control, supervision or jurisdiction of an authority not
         only different from, but also independent of, the authority,
         which had the control, supervision or jurisdiction over the
         earlier investigating agency. In this sense, an investigation
         conducted by an investigating agency, such as, Criminal
         Investigation Department of a State, is not different from the
         ordinary police machinery of the State concerned, because
         both of them are under the jurisdiction of the same State;</p><pre id="pre_4">

         which is different from the normal police investigation of the
         State or its Criminal Investigation Department. As has been
         pointed out in clear terms, in A.S. Peter (supra), what <a href="/doc/147367599/" id="a_39">Section
         173(8)</a> permits is a "further investigation‟ and not a "re-
         investigation‟. What is, however, extremely important to bear
         in mind is that a reinvestigation being prohibited by law, it
         would not, ordinarily, be ordered by a superior court. It, thus,
         becomes clear that a "reinvestigation‟ would be ordered in the
         situations, which are extra-ordinary, rare and cannot be met by
         a "further investigation‟. [See Kishan Lal (supra).
</p>


<p id="p_57">         25.   The defective, biased or the mala fide investigation or a
         tainted investigation cannot give rise to a valid charge-sheet,
         because such investigation would, ultimately, prove to be
         precursor of miscarriage of criminal justice. Not only, therefore,
         "fair trial‟, but "fair investigation‟ too form part of the
         Constitutional rights guaranteed under Articles 20 and 21 of
         the Constitution of India. The investigation, therefore, must be
         fair, transparent and judicious. In fact, fairness in investigation
         and, consequently, 'fairness in trial‟ form the basic minimum
         requirement of the "rule of law‟. When non-interference by the
         Court with an investigation would, ultimately, result in failure
         of justice, the Court must interfere. A reference, in this regard,
         may be made to the case of Babu Bhai (supra) wherein the
         Supreme Court observed thus:

<blockquote id="blockquote_15">               "34. ................ If the investigation has not been

                 of miscarriage of criminal justice. In such a case the court
                 would simply try to decipher the truth only on the basis
                 of guess or conjunctures as the whole truth would not
                 come before it. It will be difficult for the court to
                 determine how the incident took place wherein three
                 persons died and so many persons including the
                 complainant and accused got injured. Not only the fair
                 trial but fair investigation is also part of constitutional
                 rights guaranteed under Articles 20 and 21 of the
                 Constitution of India. Therefore, investigation must be
                 fair, transparent and judicious as it is the minimum
                 requirement of rule of law. Investigating agency cannot
                 be permitted to conduct an investigation in tainted and
                 biased manner. Where non- interference of the court
                 would ultimately result in failure of justice, the court
                 must interfere." [Emphasis is added]"

         of power by those, who are in charge of an investigation, is
         made out, the court should be quite loathe to interfere with the
         investigation, which is, ordinarily, a field of activity reserved
         for the police and the executives. Commenting on this aspect
         of law, the Supreme Court observed, in Babu Bhai (supra),
         thus:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_16">                 "21. ..........The manner in which the investigation has
                 been carried out as well as the manner in which these
                 cases have been conducted before this Court, clearly
                 indicate that the investigation is not fair and impartial
                 and as such the investigating agency cannot be
                 permitted to continue.

<blockquote id="blockquote_17">                 31. Unless an extra ordinary case of gross abuse of

         and 32 of the Constitution of India, can direct the State to get
         an offence 'investigated‟ and/or „further investigated‟ by a
         different agency. The relevant observations, made by the
         Supreme Court, in this regard, read thus:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_18">               "The investigating officer may exercise his statutory
               power of further investigation in several situations as, for
               example, when new facts come to his notice; when
               certain aspects of the matter had not been considered by
               him and he found that further investigation is necessary
               to be carried out from a different angle(s) keeping in view
               the fact that new or further materials came to his notice.
               Apart from the aforementioned grounds, the learned
               Magistrate or the superior courts can direct further
               investigation, if the investigation is found to be tainted
               and/or otherwise unfair or is otherwise necessary in the
               ends of justice." [Emphasis added]"
