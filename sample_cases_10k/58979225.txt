                                Versus

          Mr. Sagar Deswal, AAG, Haryana,
          for the State.


VIJENDER SINGH MALIK, J.
</pre>
<p id="p_1">          Ramesh Shastri, the petitioner has brought this petition under

the provisions of <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_1">section 482</a> Cr. P.C., for quashing of FIR No.33

dated 25.5.2005 (Annexure P1) registered at Police Station Jatusana,

District Rewari for an offence punishable under <a href="/doc/1436241/" id="a_2">sections 420</a>, <a href="/doc/1317063/" id="a_3">465</a>, <a href="/doc/556166/" id="a_4">468</a>

and <a href="/doc/1991013/" id="a_5">470</a> IPC alongwith all the subsequent proceedings arising out of the

same on the basis of compromise (Annexure P2).
</p>
<p id="p_2">          While issuing notice of motion, the parties were directed to

appear before learned Illaqa Magistrate on 26.11.2012 for getting their

statements recorded in support of the compromise. Learned Judicial

Magistrate Ist Class, Kosli has sent his report in this regard through
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1"> Crl. Misc. No.M-35512 of 2012                                 2</span>
                    ..
</p><p id="p_3">learned District &amp; Sessions Judge, Rewari. He has reported that he had

recorded the statements of the parties, who have supported the factum of

compromise. He has concluded his report by submitting that the parties

have already settled their grievances amicably and that the compromise

arrived at between them through the intervention of the respectable

persons and relatives, is without any pressure or coercion from anyone.

</p><p id="p_4">          The contested decisions made by the courts may leave scars

on the litigants losing the battle. In a decision based on compromise,

none is a loser and, therefore, it does not leave any such scar.

Compromise not only brings peace and harmony between the parties to

a dispute but also restores tranquility in the society. Taking restoration of

peace and harmonious relations between the parties and order in the

society as the prime concerns of law, it has been held by this court in

Dharambir Vs. State of Haryana, 2005 (3) RCR (Criminal) 426 that a

non compoundable matrimonial offence could be quashed on the basis of

compromise between the parties. However, the said decision left a gap

as it did not cover the cases other than the cases for matrimonial

offences. A Larger Bench of five Hon`ble Judges of this court in

Kulwinder Singh and others Vs. State of Punjab and another 2007

(3) RCR (Criminal) 1052 took the following decision with regard to the

other non-compoundable offences:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">          "29. The only inevitable conclusion from the above discussion
          is that there is no statutory bar under the <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_6">Cr.P.C</a>. which can
          affect the inherent power of this Court under Section482.
          Further, the same cannot be limited to matrimonial cases alone
          and the Court has the wide power to quash the proceedings
          even in noncompoundable offences notwithstanding the bar
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2"> Crl. Misc. No.M-35512 of 2012                                 3</span>
                    ..
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">          under <a href="/doc/91933/" id="a_7">Section 320</a> of the Cr.P.C., in order to prevent the abuse
          of law and to secure the ends of justice."</blockquote><p id="p_5">

</p><p id="p_6">          The FIRs/complaints in non-compoundable offences could,

therefore, be quashed on the basis of compromise. It is so because after

compromise, no evidence supporting the prosecution is possible to come

on the record and possibility of conviction of the accused becomes bleak.

However, before accepting the petition and quashing the proceedings,

the court has to satisfy itself that the compromise is just and fair in which

no party is taking undue benefit. The compromise in hand not only

satisfies the above said requirements, but also appears to be securing

the ends of justice. I, therefore, find that the matter has been amicably

settled between the parties without their being any pressure on anyone.

Hence, the petition is allowed and FIR No.33 dated 25.5.2005 (Annexure

P1) registered at Police Station Jatusana, District Rewari for an offence

punishable under <a href="/doc/1436241/" id="a_8">sections 420</a>, <a href="/doc/1317063/" id="a_9">465</a>, <a href="/doc/556166/" id="a_10">468</a> and <a href="/doc/1991013/" id="a_11">470</a> IPC along with all the

subsequent proceedings arising out of the same is quashed.
