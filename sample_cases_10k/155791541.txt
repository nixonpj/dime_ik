</p> 
<p id="p_2">The petitioner has preferred the present writ petition with the following main prayers:-
</p> 
<p id="p_3">"I. To issue a writ order or direction in the nature of mandamus commanding and directing the respondent No.2 to adjust the petitioner in the other institution being selected candidate for science Teacher in LT Grade as per select Panel.

<p id="p_4">II. To, issue writ order or direction in the nature of mandamus commanding and directing the respondent No.3 to pay the salary and other emoluments to the petitioner as and when due admissible to the said post."
</p> 
<p id="p_5">In view of the order proposed to be passed, notice need not to be issued to the respondent no.4. 
</p> 
<p id="p_6">Learned counsel for the petitioner contended that the petitioner was duly selected by the U.P. Secondary Education Service Selection Board, Allahabad (Now Prayagraj) on 5.10.2018 on the post of L.T. Grade Teacher. A copy of the notification in this regard issued by the respondent no.2 is appended as annexure 2 to the writ petition. After the aforesaid notification was issued the petitioner was allotted an institution namely Radhey Lal Inter College, Kachhala, District Budaun. Subsequently pursuant to the aforesaid, a letter dated 3.6.2019 was written by the Secretary of the Board to the District Inspector of Schools directing him to ensure the joining of the petitioner in the institution in question. It is stated that pursuant to the same a letter dated 10.6.2019 was written by the District Inspector of Schools, Badaun, to the Manager of the institution in question to permit the petitioner to join the institution in question. It is further stated that inspite of the same till date the respondent no.4 is not issuing any appointment letter to the petitioner in this regard. It is contended that it appears that in the institution in question no post is vacant and as such the letter dated 10.7.2019 was written by the District Inspector of Schools, Budaun, to the Secretary, U.P. Secondary Education Service Selection Board, Allahabad (Now Prayagraj) that it is not possible for him to permit the petitioner to join the institution in question since there is no post vacant in the institution. When the petitioner came to know regarding the aforesaid fact he made a representation before the Secretary of the Board dated 22.8.2019, copy of which is appended as annexure 8 to the writ petition. It is stated that inspite of the fact that a considerable time has already lapsed till date no action has been taken on the aforesaid representation of the petitioner. 
</p> 
<p id="p_7">No useful purpose would be served in keeping the writ petition pending hence with the consent of learned counsel for the parties, the writ petition is being disposed of at the admission stage itself. 
</p> 
<p id="p_8">In the facts and circumstances, the petitioner is permitted to make a fresh representation ventillating all his grievances before the respondent no.2/Secretary, U.P. Secondary Education Service Selection Board, Allahabad (Prayagraj) along-with certified copy of this order within a period of two weeks from today. If such a representation is made, the respondent no.2 is directed to pass necessary orders in accordance with law within a further period of four weeks.
</p> 
<p id="p_9">With the aforesaid observations, present writ petition is disposed of finally. 
</p> 
<p id="p_10">It is made clear that this Court has not entered into the merits of the case and thus it is for authority concerned to take a decision independently in accordance with law.
</p> 
<p id="p_11">Order Date :- 22.11.2019
