              SRI H.L.PRADEEP KUMAR, ADVOCATE FOR
          SRI BASAVARAJ V. SABARAD, ADVOCATE FOR R7]

      THIS R.F.A. IS FILED UNDER ORDER 41 RULE 1 R/W
SECTION 96 OF CPC AGAINST THE JUDGMENT AND DECREE
DATED 12.8.2013 PASSED IN O.S.NO.352/2011 ON THE FILE OF
THE SENIOR CIVIL JUDGE &amp; JMFC., NELAMANGALA, ALLOWING
THE I.A.NO.6 FILED UNDER ORDER 7 RULE 11(d) OF CPC.

    THIS R.F.A. COMING ON FOR HEARING THIS DAY, THE
COURT DELIVERED THE FOLLOWING:


                         JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">      Although the matter is listed for hearing on I.A.2/13 for

vacating the interim order, I have taken up the matter for final

disposal with the consent of the learned advocates appearing for

the parties.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">      2. The facts of the case in brief are that the respondent

No.1 is the father of the appellant - plaintiff and the respondent

Nos.2 to 6.     The schedule 'A' property measuring 1 acre 20

guntas was acquired for the purpose and benefit of the

Karnataka Industrial Areas Development Board ('KIADB' for

short).    The seventh respondent - Special Land Acquisition

Officer of KIADB passed the award for a sum of `67,50,000/- for

the acquisition of schedule 'A' property.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                  4</span>


</p><p id="p_4">      3. The appellant represented to the respondent No.7 that

she is entitled to 1/7th share in the said compensation amount.

As she did not get the amounts, she filed the suit for partition.

The respondent Nos.1 to 6 filed the written statement.        They

also made I.A.No.6 invoking Order VII Rule 11(d) of C.P.C. for

the rejection of the plaint.      On considering the averments

contained in the plaint and the written statement and on hearing

the rival contentions urged on behalf of the parties, the Trial

Court, by its order, dated 12.8.2013 allowed the said I.A.No.6.

As the plaint is rejected by virtue of the said order, the plaintiff

has come in appeal before this Court.
</p>
<p id="p_5">
</p><p id="p_6">      4. Sri Gururaj Kulkarni, the learned counsel for the

appellant submits that the appellant is a member of the joint

family consisting of the first respondent - defendant and the

respondent Nos.2 to 6. He submits that the land in question was

granted by the Government to the family of the first defendant,

that is, for the benefit of the members of the family, which

included the appellant too.
</p>
<p id="p_7">
</p><p id="p_8">      5. Sri Gururaj Kulkarni submits that the respondent No.3

died during the pendency of the suit. Thereafter, the appellant
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                   5</span>


has modified her claim from 1/7th to 1/6th share. According to

him, the appellant - plaintiff is entitled to `11,25,000/-.


</p><p id="p_9">      6. The learned counsel sought to draw support from the

Apex Court's judgment in the case of BHANU RAM v. JANAK

SINGH &amp; ORS., reported in AIR 2012 SC 3023, wherein it is

held that the application for the rejection of the plaint has to be

considered only on the basis of the averments made in the

plaint. The pleas taken in the written statement are totally

irrelevant.
</p>
<p id="p_10">
</p><p id="p_11">      7. The learned counsel also read out Head Note 'C' from

this Court's decision in the case of <a href="/doc/1563842/" id="a_1">VERUPEGOWDA AND

ANOTHER v. SHANKAREGOWDA AND ANOTHER</a>, reported in

ILR 2009 KAR 1867. It is extracted hereinbelow:-

</p><p id="p_12">         "(C)   KARNATAKA     LAND    REFORMS    ACT,   1961-
</p><p id="p_13">      SECTION 2(11), 2(23) 4, 44 and 45 - Statutory
      provisions - effect of vesting - Registration in the name
      of a family member - Concurrent error committed by the
      Courts below in not understanding the relevant statutory
      provisions - HELD, when the occupancy right is ordered
      to be registered in the name of a member of the family
      whose name appeared in the record of rights or in any
      other public or revenue record, it would enure to the
      benefit of the entire family.   The moment occupancy
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                            6</span>


       right is registered or granted, such property become
       partible. It is only the vested land under the Act, which
       can be ordered to be granted.              The land in respect of
       which occupancy rights are registered/granted, the same
       would be with reference to the date of vesting in the
       State Government though the orders are passed by the
       tribunal subsequently.            ON FACTS HELD, The Courts
       below      have   not   considered        the   relevant   statutory
       provisions and the effect of the vesting of the land in the
       State Government and its registration thereafter in the
       name of a family member.                Hence, there is apparent
       illegality committed, which calls for interference."


</p><p id="p_14">       8.   Sri    H.K.Ravi,       the    learned      counsel    appearing     for

M/s.Kantharaj &amp; Associates for the respondent Nos.1 to 6

submits that the appellant is not a member of the first

respondent's joint family. The land in question is granted to the

first respondent by taking the sale consideration from him. As

the grant-order, mutation entry and record of rights are clearly

indicative that the property in question is a self-acquired

property of the first respondent, no enquiry is called for.                     He

submits that under Section 133 of the Karnataka Land Revenue

Act,   1964,      the    entries    in     the    revenue     records    have    a

presumptive value that they are valid.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                 7</span><p id="p_15">


</p><p id="p_16">      9. Sri H.L.Pradeep Kumar, the learned counsel appearing

for Sri Basavaraj V. Sabarad for the respondent No.7 submits

that the award is passed and that the amount would be

disbursed depending on the outcome of the proceedings before

this Court.
</p>
<p id="p_17">
</p><p id="p_18">      10. I notice with concern that the third defendant is shown

as the respondent No.3 in the cause-title, but with a note that he

is not made a party, because he is dead.         On being asked

whether she has left behind any legal representatives, Sri

Gururaj Kulkarni, the learned counsel for the appellant says that

she died unmarried and that she has not left behind her any

legal representatives. There is no question of her being made a

party to these proceedings or being dropped from the suit

proceedings, as she died during the pendency of the suit

proceedings. I therefore hold that suit as against the defendant

No.3 stands abated.
</p>
<p id="p_19">
</p><p id="p_20">      11. The scope for rejecting the plaint in exercise of the

power conferred by Order VII Rule 11(a) of C.P.C. is rather

limited. In I.A.No.6, no specific sub-clause of Rule 11 is invoked.

However, in the application it is prayed that the plaint be
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                       8</span>


rejected, as there is no cause of action. Such a request can be

considered only within the ambit of Rule 11(a) of Order VII. The

provisions contained in Order VII Rule 11(a) reads as follows:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">         "11. Rejection of plaint. - The plaint shall be
      rejected in following cases:-

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">         (a) where it does not disclose a cause of action."</blockquote><p id="p_21">


</p><p id="p_22">      12. The cause of action should be culled out on a conjoint

reading of all the paragraphs of the plaint. Whether there is a

cause of action or not is to be determined on the assumption

that every averment in the plaint is true. In saying so, I am

fortified by the decision of Manipur High Court in the case of

THOUNAOJAM NIMGOL INDRANI DEVI AND OTHERS v.

THE MUNICIPAL BOARD OF IMPHAL AND OTHERS reported

in AIR 1958 MANIPUR 27. All the statements are to be taken

as true for argument on preliminary issue as to whether the

plaint discloses the cause of action or not.


</p><p id="p_23">      13. When an application is filed for the rejection of the

plaint on the ground that there is no cause of action, the Court is

required to look at the plaint and the documents accompanying

the plaint only and nothing else. The defence of the defendants

should not be examined at this stage. Therefore, examining the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                 9</span>


defence of the defendants coupled with the accompanying

documents and thereby rejecting the plaint is not proper.


</p><p id="p_24">      14. In the case of M/S. ZUARI INDUSTRIES LTD. CO. v.

COMMUNIDADE OF SANCOALE AND OTHERS reported in

AIR 2007 (NOC) 97 Bombay High Court held that the Court

has to ascertain whether the plaint discloses the cause of action

or not and not to ascertain whether the plaintiff would be

entitled to get the relief asked for in the facts and circumstances

of the case.
</p>
<p id="p_25">
</p><p id="p_26">      15.   The perusal of the impugned order reveals that the

Trial Court has gone by the averments made in the written

statement. Based thereon it has come to the conclusion that suit

schedule 'A' property is the self-acquired property of the first

respondent. The approach adopted by the Trial Judge is not

sound.
</p>
<p id="p_27">
</p><p id="p_28">      16.   The plain reading of the plaint does not reveal that

there are no triable issues at all. Whether the suit schedule 'A'

property is the self-acquired property of the first defendant,

whether the appellant is entitled to any share therein or in the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                  10</span>


compensation-amount determined on its compulsory acquisition,

etc. are all the disputed questions of facts, which can be

resolved only on holding the trial. Similarly, even when I find the

substance in the submission urged on behalf of the contesting

respondents that the entries in the revenue records have the

presumptive     value,   what   cannot   be   denied   is   that   the

presumptive value can always be rebutted and a party cannot be

denied of an opportunity to rebut it.
</p>
<p id="p_29">
</p><p id="p_30">       17.   However, on holding the enquiry, if the Trial Court

finds that the appellant - plaintiff has filed the suit advancing the

claims without there being any basis for the same, it may

consider imposing the exemplary costs on the appellant -

plaintiff.
</p>
<p id="p_31">
</p><p id="p_32">       18.   For all the aforesaid reasons, I allow this appeal by

setting aside the order under appeal and remand the matter to

the Trial Court for enquiry in accordance with law.


</p><p id="p_33">       19. I.A.No.6 stands rejected. The Trial Court is directed to

hold the enquiry in accordance with law. The parties are directed

to appear before the Trial Court on 12.2.2014 without waiting for
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                   11</span>


any notice from the Trial Court. The parties are directed to co-

operate with the Trial Court in the speedy disposal of the mater.

The matter shall be disposed of as expeditiously as possible and

in any case within an outer limit of one year from 12.2.2014.


</p><p id="p_34">       20. Sri Gururaj Kulkarni, the learned counsel for the

appellant fairly indicates his no objection to the release of 5/6th

of the compensation-amounts to the defendants, who are

entitled to receive the same. It is open to the respondent No.7

[SLAO, KIADB (defendant No.7 originally)], to release the

compensation-amounts to the other claimants, but he shall not

disburse/release 1/6th of the compensation-amount to any party

till   the   matter   is   adjudicated   by   the   Trial   Court   in

O.S.No.352/2011.
