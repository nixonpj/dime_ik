unmarried minor girl then aged around seventeen/seventeen and a

half years, alleging that the             accused-non-applicant Deepi Singh

alias Hardeep Singh had mediated between her for marriage with

the present accused petitioner Gursewak Singh. On 12.8.2018 in

the afternoon, the prosecutrix received a call from the petitioner

telling her to get ready as he was coming. On the basis of which,

the complainant went out where petitioner met her and took her on a

motor bike to fields and on the enticement of marriage raped her

against her wishes and thereafter deserted her leading to the

registration of the present case.
</p>
<p id="p_4">             Mr. PS Sekhon, learned counsel for the petitioner has

argued that co-accused of the petitioner namely Hardeep Singh alias

Deepi has been allowed regular bail by this Court vide orders dated

13.3.2019 and the petitioner is behind the bars since a long time. It

is submitted that the girl has volunteered into this relationship and

therefore, allegations of forcible rape do not exist.

</p><p id="p_5">             Learned State counsel, Mr. Harbir Sandhu, AAG, Punjab

has strongly opposed the prayer of the petitioner submitting that a

minor girl on the enticement of marriage has been taken away and

defiled and in view of the heinousness of the offence, the petitioner

is not entitled to any relief.

</p>
<p id="p_8">


</p><p id="p_9">              As is there on the records, co-accused Hardeep Singh

was allowed regular bail as his case was quite distinguishable from

that of the present petitioner and therefore, principle of parity cannot

be sought in the case of present petitioner-accused. The accused-

petitioner by his deceptive acts has enticed a minor girl and

thereafter defiled her on the fraudulent pretext of marriage. Thus in

view of the seriousness of the allegations, the petitioner does not

entitle to any relief. The present petition thus stands dismissed.</p><pre id="pre_2">
