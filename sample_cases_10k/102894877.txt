<p id="p_2"> 2.                    The parties to the appeal will be referred with the same title as they
were in the civil suit. The appellant herein was the plaintiff, therefore, he will be
referred as plaintiff and respondent herein was the defendant, therefore, he will be
referred as the defendant.
</p><p id="p_3">3.                    During the pendency of the suit before the Ld. Trial Court/Civil
Judge, the plaintiff expired and vide order dated 01.10.2008, his LRs were
impleaded in place of him.
</p><p id="p_4">4.                    The plaintiff had filed the above­numbered civil suit in the year 1998
against the defendant for possession, arrears of share of plaintiff and rendition of
accounts, qua one of the shop forming part of property bearing no. 685, Nai Basti,
Main Road, Nehru Nagar, New Delhi­110 008. The plaintiff has stated himself to be
the owner of the entire property bearing no. 685, Nai Basti, Main Road, Nehru
Nagar, New Delhi­110 008 (hereinafter referred as the "Suit Property"). The suit
property is stated to be residential­cum­commercial as there are 2 shops on the
front side and 2 rooms on the back side, on the ground floor of the suit property.
</p><p id="p_5">5.                    It is stated in the plaint by the plaintiff that defendant is a Barbar by
profession and was known to the plaintiff. The defendant approached the plaintiff
to use one of the shop situated on the front side of the suit property on license basis
for running a Barbar shop. On the request of the defendant, the plaintiff permitted
the defendant to use one of the shop (as shown in red in the site plan attached with
the plaint) (hereinafter referred as "Suit Shop"), on the understanding that at the
end of each day, the defendant will give proper accounts of his income and 50% of
the said income to the plaintiff apart from license fee of Rs. 50/­ per day. In
pursuance of the said understanding, the defendant for some period of time paid
the 50% share of his income alongwith Rs. 50/­ per day to the plaintiff. But, with
passage of time, the defendant started threatening the plaintiff, therefore, the
plaintiff filed a civil suit bearing no. 215/97, for permanent injunction against the
defendant, praying that defendant be restrained from illegally disposing the suit

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">Tej Pal Vs. Sua Lal                                                                    Page 2 of 11</span>
 shop. On the statement of the defendant that it would not be done by him, the said
suit was got dismissed in default by the plaintiff on 17.03.1998. However,
subsequently again some differences arose between the parties and defendant
stopped paying Rs. 50/­ per day and 50% of his income to the plaintiff. Thereafter,
the plaintiff issued a legal notice dated 06.09.1998, calling upon the defendant to
render all the accounts of income from May­1996 and to pay the 50% share of his
income and Rs. 50/­ per day. The defendant despite service of the said legal notice,
did not do the needful. Hence, the suit was filed by the plaintiff.
</p><p id="p_6">6.                    The defendant resisted the suit of the plaintiff by contending that
plaintiff is not the owner of the suit property but the suit property belongs to Union
of India. He has also denied that he is licensee of the plaintiff in the suit shop but
has stated that he alongwith his brothers Dalip, Lakhi Ram and Ram Rattan is
residing and working in the suit shop as owner of the Malba since the year 1985.
The suit property is stated to be raised and developed by the defendant and his
brothers. It is stated that the plaintiff has house adjacent to the suit property which
is also raised on the Government land. He has denied any understanding between
the parties regarding payment of 50% of defendant's income and Rs. 50/­ per day
to the plaintiff.

issues. But, all other issues decided against the plaintiff are under challenged in the
appeal.
</p><p id="p_22">12.                   The Ld. Trial Court vide impugned judgment/decree dated
31.07.2017, dismissed the suit of the plaintiff preliminary on two grounds, first

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">Tej Pal Vs. Sua Lal                                                                  Page 5 of 11</span>
 that the plaintiff has failed to prove his ownership in the suit property due to
unregistered documents in his favour and secondly, that plaintiff also failed to
prove the licensor and licensee relationship between the parties.
</p><p id="p_23">13.                   I have heard counsels for the parties and perused the record.
</p><p id="p_24">14.                   The plaintiff has stated that he is owner of the suit property by virtue
of GPA, agreement to sell, affidavit and receipt, all dated 12.12.1987 (Ex. PW­1/1
to Ex. PW­1/4). The defendant has nowhere denied either in the written statement
or during evidence, the execution of documents Ex. PW­1/1 to Ex. PW­1/4. But, the
Ld. Trial court discarded these documents of the plaintiff by holding that they are
unregistered documents, therefore, does not confer any ownership rights on the
plaintiff qua the suit property. To the mind of this court, the reasoning of Ld. Trial
Court, in discarding the documents Ex. PW­1/1 to Ex. PW­1/4, is erroneous for the
reason that the plaintiff was claiming his ownership on the GPA set of documents
pertaining to the year 1987 i.e. prior to amendment of Section 53 (A) of Transfer of
Property Act (TPA). The Section 53 (A) was inserted in the books by Act of 2001,
therefore, the GPA set of documents prior to the year 2001, was not required to be
compulsory registered. In this regard, reference can be made to "Gurmeet Kaur
Vs. Harbhajan Singh" 2017 (3) CLJ 239 Delhi and "Ramesh Chand Vs. Suresh
Chand &amp; Anr", 188 (2012) DLT 538, wherein the Hon'ble High Court has held
that "the GPA set of documents executed prior to 24.09.2001 does not require
compulsory registration and stamp". The relevant portion of the judgment is re­
produced as under:­
                      "The plaintiff prove the documents being agreement to
                      sell, GPA and receipt Ex. PW­1/2 to Ex. PW­1/4. These
                      documents have been executed prior to amendment of
                      <a href="/doc/1693670/" id="a_1">Section 53</a> (A) of Transfer of Property Act, 1882, by Act of
                      2001 which came into effect from 24.09.2001. These
                      documents, therefore, need not have been stamped or

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">Tej Pal Vs. Sua Lal                                                                   Page 6 of 11</span>
                       registered so as to create right in terms of doctrine of part
                      performance under the then existing Section 53 (A) of
                      Transfer of Property Act (TPA). It is only way of
                      subsequent amendment of Section 53 (A) of TPA w.e.f.
</p><p id="p_25">                      24.09.2001 that an agreement to sell would not confer
                      any rights in terms of doctrine of part performance if such
                      an agreement to sell is not registered".
</p>

<p id="p_26">15.                   In view of <a href="/doc/1693670/" id="a_2">Section 53</a> (A) of Transfer of Property Act and judgment of
"Gurmeet Kaur" (Supra), the GPA set of documents relied upon by the plaintiff
were not required compulsory registration still this court found that the GPA Ex.
PW­1/1 and receipt Ex. PW­1/4 relied upon by the plaintiff qua the suit property
are registered documents. Hence, the plaintiff has duly proved his ownership in the
suit property by virtue of GPA set of documents Ex. PW­1/1 to Ex. PW­1/4.
</p><p id="p_27">16.                   The case of the plaintiff is that defendant was known to him and
requested him to give suit shop to the defendant to run a Barbar shop from there.
The plaintiff acceded to the request of the defendant and allowed him to use the
suit shop on the license fees of Rs. 50/­ per day and to share the 50% income of the
shop with the plaintiff. In the affidavit in evidence, the PW­1 has stated that the
plaintiff (since deceased) gave the suit shop to the defendant on license basis in the
year 1993. The defendant resisted the suit of the plaintiff by stating that the
plaintiff is not the owner of the suit property and it belongs to the Government of
India. He has denied that he was put into the possession of the suit shop by the
plaintiff as licensee. Rather, he has claimed that he alongwith his brothers is
occupying the suit shop being owner of the Malba of the property since 1985. The
defendant has also raised the plea that the suit shop in possession of the defendant
is not the part of the property of the plaintiff but the plaintiff is residing in the
adjacent plot where the suit shop is situated.

<p id="p_28"> 17.                   The one of the ground of the defendant to counter the suit of the
plaintiff is that suit property is situated on the Government land. On this, the Ld.
Trial court has rightly observed in the impugned judgment that the defendant has
not placed anything on record to prove that the suit land belongs to the
Government of India. The defendant has also resisted the suit of the plaintiff by
stating that he alongwith his brothers is in possession of the suit property since the
year 1985, being owner of the malba over the suit property since the suit property
was constructed by him and he is not occupying the suit shop as a licensee of the
plaintiff as alleged. The defendant has not placed anything on record or even has
not whispered either in his pleadings or in his evidence that how he has become
the owner of the malba of the suit property and on what basis he is claiming his
title over the same. He has neither led any oral or documentary evidence to prove
that the suit property/suit shop was constructed by him. He has not placed even a
single document viz electricity, water, telephone bills or any correspondence
received by him since the year 1985 on the suit property to show that he is in
possession of the suit property since the year 1985.
</p><p id="p_29">                      Now, the question before the court is that if defendant is not the
owner of the suit property and as per him, he is not even the licensee of the
plaintiff then how he came into the possession of the suit property.
</p><p id="p_30">18.                   A person may occupy the immovable property in the following
capacity(s):­ (a) being owner of the same; (b) as tenant; (c) as licensee/permissive
user and (d) trespasser.
</p><p id="p_31">19.                   Here, it is not the case of either of the party that the defendant is
occupying the property either as a tenant or trespasser. As per plaintiff, the
defendant is his licensee but as per the defendant, he is occupying the suit shop
being owner of the malba since the year 1985. As already mentioned that
defendant has not brought anything on record to prove his ownership even his
possession in the suit shop since 1985. On the other hand, PW­1 (wife of deceased

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">Tej Pal Vs. Sua Lal                                                                Page 8 of 11</span>
 plaintiff) has categorically deposed in her affidavit that defendant was put into
possession by the plaintiff as licensee in the year 1993. Now, in the background
when the defendant is neither the owner nor the tenant or the trespasser in the suit
shop, then the necessary implication is that he is occupying the suit shop as a
licensee of the plaintiff, who has duly proved his ownership in the suit property.
Even, the own document i.e. legal notice dated 11.06.1996 (Ex. DW­1/X), of the
defendant shows that defendant himself has admitted in the said notice that he was
put into the possession of the suit shop by the plaintiff on the charges of Rs. 175/­
per month. The defendant has relied upon one legal notice dated 11.06.1996 (Ex.
DW­1/X) stated to be sent by him to the plaintiff. In the said notice, the defendant
has stated that he was paying the rent @ Rs. 175/­ per month to the plaintiff. The
defendant has nowhere pleaded that he is the tenant of the plaintiff, therefore, the
statement made by the defendant in the legal notice (Ex. DW­1/X) can safely be
read that he was put into the possession of the suit shop by the plaintiff on the
charges/license fees of Rs. 175/­ per month. Furthermore, the plaintiff also sent a
legal notice dated 06.09.1998 (Ex. PW­1/12) to the defendant thereby terminating
the license of the defendant in which he specifically mentioned that defendant was
permitted by him to use the suit shop for running a Barbar shop. The defendant in
his cross examination specifically admitted receiving of legal notice (Ex. PW­1/12).
It is settled law that if the legal notice despite service is not replied by a party, the
contents of the legal notice are deemed to be admitted by him. There is sufficient
material on record to hold that the suit shop was given by the plaintiff being owner
of the same to the defendant on license to run a Barbar shop from there. Apart
from this, there is one more reason that plaintiff is entitled for the possession of the
suit shop that where the suit is filed for possession on the basis of relationship of
licensee and licensor and the plaintiff fails to prove the said relationship but duly
proves his general title over the suit property and the defendant fails to prove his
defence whatsoever then the plaintiff is entitled for the possession of the suit

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">Tej Pal Vs. Sua Lal                                                             Page 9 of 11</span>
 property even on the basis of his general title.
</p><p id="p_32">20.                   The defendant has raised a plea that the suit shop is not the part of
the property of the plaintiff but the plaintiff is residing in the adjacent property
where the suit shop is situated. This plea of the defendant is baseless for the reason
that the plaintiff has filed the site plan Ex. PW­1/5, mentioning the suit shop
forming part of the suit property, in red colour. During cross examination, the
defendant has admitted that he is in possession of suit shop as mentioned in Ex.
PW­1/5. The defendant has not filed his site plan to prove his contention that suit
shop is not the part of the property owned by the plaintiff.
</p><p id="p_33">21.                   The plaintiff has also claimed recovery of Rs. 43,500/­ on account of
arrear of license fees on the amount of Rs. 50/­ per day w.e.f. May­1996 till
October­1998 i.e. till filing of the suit. In the preceding paras, the court has already
observed that the defendant was the licensee of the plaintiff in suit shop since the
year 1993. The PW­1 has deposed in her affidavit that the defendant stopped
paying the licenses fees w.e.f. May­1996. The own document of the defendant i.e.
legal notice dated 11.06.1996 (Ex. DW­1/X) is suffice to hold that he stopped
paying any amount on account of using the suit shop to the plaintiff w.e.f. June­
1996 as in the said notice, he has stated that the amount of Rs. 175/­ per month on
account of rent paid by him to the plaintiff was illegally received by the plaintiff
and by way of said notice, he has demanded the amount of Rs. 10,836/­ on account
of rent already paid by the defendant to the plaintiff. Thus, the intention of the
defendant is clear from the said notice that he had not paid any use and occupation
charges of the suit shop to the plaintiff w.e.f. June­1996. Accordingly, the plaintiff
is entitled for the said charges w.e.f. June­1996.
</p><p id="p_34">                      So far as, the quantum of license fees is concerned, for that the
plaintiff has stated that license fee was Rs. 50/­ per day and 50% share in the
income of the defendant. The plaintiff has not placed anything on record to prove
the quantum of the license fee as stated by him. But, again the legal notice dated

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">Tej Pal Vs. Sua Lal                                                               Page 10 of 11</span>
 11.06.1996 (Ex. DW­1/X), is suffice to hold that the defendant was paying the
license fee to the plaintiff. As per the said legal notice, the license fee was Rs. 175/­
per month. The plaintiff has not led any evidence to prove the prevalent rate of
rent in the vicinity where the suit property is situated, therefore, considering the
area of the suit shop is small the amount claimed by the plaintiff @ Rs. 1500/­ per
month, in the opinion of the court is reasonable, accordingly, the plaintiff is held
entitled for the use and occupation charges from the defendant @ Rs. 1500/­ per
month w.e.f. June­1996 till December­2000, with 10% increase every 5 years till
actual vacation of the suit shop by the defendant. The defendant is directed to clear
the arrears w.e.f. June­1996 till December­2018 within 45 days from today failing
the interest @ 4% per annum will be paid by the defendant.
</p><p id="p_35">                      The plaintiff is directed to pay the requisite court fees on the
mesne profit/use and occupation charges awarded by the court, within 10
days from today.
</p><p id="p_36">22.                   The plaintiff has not led any evidence to show his agreement between
the parties to share the 50% income of the defendant, hence, the prayer of the
plaintiff for rendition of account is hereby declined.
</p><p id="p_37">23.                   In view of aforesaid discussion, the present appeal is allowed and the
impugned judgment/decree dated 31.07.2017, is hereby set aside.
