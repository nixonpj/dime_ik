PER COURT : 
</p>

<p id="p_3">1.     In   all   these   matters,   the   petitioners   have   challenged   the 

common   judgment   dated   09/11/2016   delivered   by   the   Industrial 

Court,   Ahmednagar   by   which   complaint   (ULP)   Nos.1/2012   and 

connected identical complaints have been dismissed.  
</p>


<p id="p_4">2.     I   have   considered   the   strenuous   submissions   of   Mr.Barde, 

learned   Advocate   for   the   petitioners,   Mr.Hon,   the   learned   Senior 

Advocate   on   behalf   of   respondent   No.1   /   Co-operative   Society   and 

Mr.Malte, learned Advocate appearing on behalf of respondent No.2.

<p id="p_5">None appears for respondent No.3 MERC though served.   With the

under :-

<blockquote id="blockquote_1">       [a]      In 1971, the Government of Maharashtra issued a license 
       to   respondent   No.1   Mula   Pravara   Electricity   Co-operative 
       Society   Ltd.,   (hereinafter   referred   to   as   the   'Society')   for

       No.2   /   Electricity   Distribution   Co.   (hereinafter   referred   to   as 
       the Company) and supply it to agriculturists.
       [c]      About 1500 workers were engaged by the Society. 
       [d]      The   work   allotted   to   such   workers   was   with   regard   to 
       ensuring   the   distribution   of   electricity,   maintenance   of 
       machines and meters and connected affairs. 
       [e]      Considering the policy of the Government at the relevant 
       time, no meters were installed with agriculturists in the said 
       Ahmednagar District. 
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">       [f]      There was no method for precisely measuring the actual 
       consumption of electricity by the agriculturists.
       [g]      The   standard   method   of   approximately   assessing   the 
       consumption   of   electricity   by   the   agriculturists,   was   on   the 
       basis of the capacity of the motors and electrical equipments 
       used by the agriculturists for agriculture purposes. 
       [h]      The Society  had to pay  the charges for consumption of 
       electricity as per actual consumption, to the company. 
       [i]      Considering   the   above   imbalance,   in   2010,   the   Society 
       owed about Rs.2,300 crores to the Government as it ran into 
       losses.  
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">       [j]      One of the reasons for non-renewal of the license w.e.f. 
       31/01/2011 was the high arrears of payments by the Society.  
       [k]      From   31/01/2011,   the   State   Government   refused   to 
       renew the Electricity Distribution License to the Society.
       [l]      The   company   was   one   of   the   applicants   for   seeking 
       distribution license in 2011.

       [m]      The   MERC/respondent   No.3   granted   the   distribution 
       license to the Company for distribution of electricity. 
       [n]      The   MERC   has   worked   out   the   modalities   though 
       litigation in this regard is pending before the Hon'ble Supreme 
       Court. 
</p><p id="p_8">       [o]      From 01/02/2011, the Society was left with no work and 
       all the workers became idle.  
</p><p id="p_9">       [p]      The Society had no work to offer to these workers as its 
       contract of distribution of electricity was brought to an end.
       [q]      There   were   3   unions   of   workers   active   in   the   Society 
       namely   the   (1)   Mula   Pravara   Veej   Kamgar   Sangh,   (2) 
       Ahmednagar   Zilla   Shramik   Sabha   and   the   petitioner   (3) 
       Rashtriya Mula Pravara Veej Kamgar Sangh. 
       [r]      The first two unions represented about 1300 workers and 
       the third union represented less than 200 workers. 
       [s]      There was a voluntary retirement scheme floated in 2008 
       which had subsequently been concluded.
</p><p id="p_10">       [t]      It appears that these workers had approached the Society 
       for seeking a solution to the loss of work and the Society agreed 
       to entertain applications for VRS.  
</p><p id="p_11">       [u]      The VRS floated on 26/07/2011 was offered on the same 
       terms   and   all   the   workers   notwithstanding   their   Union 
       affiliations, applied for acceptance of the VRS.     However, the 
       dead lock continued.
</p><p id="p_12">       [v]      On 12/12/2012, a settlement was signed under <a href="/doc/1418464/" id="a_1">section

       who agreed to accept the benefits of the VRS with the cut-off 
       date 31/05/2012 for the purpose of calculating the payments.

       [w]      Those employees, who were on the rolls of the Society as 
       on 31/05/2012, were held eligible for the VRS.
       [x]      It   was   specifically   agreed   that   all   the   employees   would 
       stand   disengaged   and   employer-employee   relationship   would 
       come to an end on 31/05/2012.

       of the basic pay with dearness allowance for the period from 
       the   cut-off   date   till   their   date   of   superannuation   as   per   the

       workers approximately before this Court and who were before 
       the Industrial Court, was not a party to the settlement dated 
       12/12/2012.  
</p><p id="p_16">       [bb]     The   Society   issued   a   circular   /   notice   on   18/12/2012 
       indicating   that   the   applications   for   VRS   filed   by   the   workers 
       were accepted and if they desire to obtain any copy of the said 
       order, they could meet the Management. These petitioners did 
       not raise any objection.
</p><p id="p_17">       [cc]     The salient feature of the settlement dated 12/12/2012 
       was that the amounts would be paid to the beneficiaries as and 
       when the Government would render its financial assistance. 
       [dd]     The petitioner/Union and some of the workers who are 
       before   this   Court,   filed   ULP   complaints   before   the   Industrial 
       Court   contending   that   they   were   not   agreeing   with   the   VRS, 
       they are compelled to accept the VRS and the wages have not 
       been paid to them.

       [ee]     All   these   original   complainants   have   filed   their 
       complaints   after   the   Society   began   the   payments   of   the   VRS 
       amounts on 12/01/2013.
</p><p id="p_19">       [ff]     The   complaint   filed   by   the   third   Union   is   also   dated 
       20/01/2013,  when   the   payments   of   the   VRS   commenced   on 
       12/01/2013.
</p><p id="p_20">       [gg]     It is stated that only 1 or two complaints were filed one 
       day   prior   to   the   commencement   of   the   disbursement   of   the 
       VRS amounts.  
</p><p id="p_21">       [hh]     All these petitioners have accepted all the amounts under 
       the VRS scheme with the cut-off date of 31/05/2012 and have 
       continued with the litigation on the ground that they are not 
       accepting the said cut off date.
</p>


<p id="p_22">4.     In   the   light   of   the   above,   I   have   considered   the   strenuous 

submissions of all the learned Advocates. 
</p>


<p id="p_23">5.     There   is   no   dispute   that   all   these   complainants   before   the 

Industrial Court accepted the VRS benefits which were paid to them 

by   the   Society   on   the   basis   of   the   cut-off   date   31/05/2012.   They 

have raised a grievance in their complaints that the Society should 

have   granted   them   the   VRS   benefits   upto   18/12/2012   when   the 

notice declaring acceptance of the VRS applications was put up by 

the Society.   Contention is that though these complainants may not 

canvass  against  the  VRS,  they   are not  agreeing   to accept   the VRS

package is indicative of acceptance of the VRS.

<p id="p_25">7.     The   fact   situation   before   this   Court   is   that   all   these 

complainants have taken all the benefits of the VRS upto the cut-off 

date 31/05/2012 and are litigating against the Society in their ULP 

complaints   on   the   ground   that   they   should   get   the   benefits   upto 

18/12/2012 and they are not aggreable to accept the benefits upto 

the cut off date 31/05/2012.  
</p>


<p id="p_26">8.     I   find   that   these   complainants   have   shrewdly   accepted   the 

entire benefits under the VRS and the payments made by the Society, 

as   and   when   the   funds   were   made   available   by   the   Government.

<p id="p_27">Only   these   employees   are   litigating   against   the   Society   for   seeking 

enhancement   in   financial   benefits   on   the   plea   that   because   the 

notice of acceptance of VRS was announced on 18/12/2012, these

18/12/2012. 
</p>


<p id="p_28">9.     As such, on the one hand, these complainants have taken all 

the benefits under the VRS and on the other, they claimed that they 

should be getting wages till 18/12/2012 though they were sitting idle 

from 01/02/2011 till 18/12/2012. It is not disputed that the Society 

paid   salary   to   these   complainants   upto   31/05/2012   though   they 

were   sitting   idle   without   work   and   the   Society   had   no   business 

activity for revenue generation.
</p>


<p id="p_29">10.    It cannot be ignored and is admitted that the Society factually 

lost all business from 01/02/2011 and was left with no work to be 

allotted to all the 1500 employees.  It was in this backdrop that more 

than 1300 workers represented by the two major unions entered into 

a   settlement   and   agreed   to  accept   all  benefits   under   the   VRS   and 

unpaid   salaries   till  31/05/2012  though  they  were   sitting   idle   from 

01/02/2011   till   31/05/2012.     As   this   settlement   was   signed   on 

12/12/2012, the Society issued the notice on 18/12/2012 accepting 

the VRS applications.   None of the petitioners have withdrawn their 

applications. All accepted the benefits.

       received the benefits under the scheme, it would be equitable to  
       direct the concerned employees to return the benefits so received

       in   the   event   the   Labour   Court   allowed   the   claim   and   granted

       the Company with interest at the rate of 6% per annum.

       Bench had No. jurisdiction to make the impugned direction. This

                is in consonance with the doctrine  of equity. It has  
                been   rightly   said   that   a   person   "who   seeks   equity  
                must do equity". Here the workmen claim benefits as  
                workmen of the Company, but they do not want  to  
                part   with   the   benefit   they   have   received   towards  
                retirement   and   severance   of   relationship   of   master

                judgment, therefore, the final direction issued by the

       this Court in Ramesh Chandra Sankla (supra). We, thus, find no  
       merit in the submission made on behalf of the Appellant that the  
       High Court had no jurisdiction to make a direction for refund of  
       the   entire   amount   received   by   the   Appellant   as   a   condition

<p id="p_34">       9.       We, however, feel that the imposition of interest @ 7.5% per  
       annum was a little harsh and unwarranted.   Having regard to  
       the fact that the appellant is no longer in service, we feel that the  
       ends of justice would meet if the direction for refund is confined  
       only   to   the   principal   amount   received   by   the   appellant   under  
       VRS.   We, accordingly, modify the order of the High Court to this  
       limited   extent   and   direct   the   appellant   to   refund   the   amount  
       received by him under VRS, without any interest.     In case the  
       amount,   as   directed,   is   deposited   by   the   appellant   by   30-11-

which is 31/05/2012. If these complainants/petitioners herein were 

not agreeable with the modalities of the settlement and the cut-off

have said so in their complaints that they are not agreeable to accept 

any benefit in the light of the cut-off date 31/05/2012.   What has 

been done is that they accepted all the benefits under the VRS and at 

the same time, continued in litigation practically demanding that the

Ramesh Chandra and Man Singh (supra).

benefits   upto 18/12/2012 on the ground that they were sitting idle 

till the said date and they are not agreeing with the settlement signed 

by the majority unions.   In my view, once these complainants before 

the Industrial Court have taken all the benefits of the VRS as like the 

entire   lot   of   1500   workers,   they   cannot   be   permitted   to   seek   a 

direction from the Industrial Court for extending the date of VRS to 

18/12/2012 and seek all salary benefits for the period of June 2012
