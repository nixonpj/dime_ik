                                                  C.R.R. No. 2484 of 2010


             In re : Ramjiban Mukherjee                                  ...Petitioner


             Mr. Joymalya Bagchi
             Mrs. Subhasree Patel                                        ... for the petitioner




                    Let this matter be come up for hearing as 'Contested Application' four weeks hence.

                    In the meantime, Learned Counsel for the petitioner is directed to serve a copy of this

             application upon the State service through the Learned Public Prosecutor, High Court, Calcutta and

             upon the wife-opposite party no. 2 under registered post/registered speed post with

             acknowledgement due and shall file affidavit of service on the next date fixed for hearing.

</p><p id="p_3">                    Pending hearing of this application, the operation of the impugned order shall remain stayed

             till two weeks after Puja Vacation, on condition that the petitioner shall go on paying a

             consolidated sum of Rs. 2200/- per month to the wife-opposite party as the maintenance for herself

             and for her minor daughter. The maintenance for this month, if not paid as yet, must be sent to her

             within a week from this date and thereafter by 7th of each succeeding month. If there is any arrear,

             it is directed that the same must be liquidated by the petitioner in two monthly equal instalments

             and be paid to the wife-opposite party along with the current maintenance.

</p><p id="p_4">                    Needless to mention, if there is any single default in making payment as directed

             hereinabove, the interim order granted in this case shall stand automatically vacated without any

             further reference to this Court.
</p>
<p id="p_5">                    I make it clear that pendency of this criminal revision will not preclude the Learned

             Magistrate to dispose of the main maintenance proceeding in accordance with law and the aforesaid
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                                    2</span>




order whereby this Court directed the petitioner to pay a total sum of Rs. 2200/- per month for the

maintenance of his wife and his minor child must not be construed as the opinion of this Court as

regards to the quantum of maintenance which either the petitioner shall be liable to pay and the

opposite parties would be entitled to receive. The Learned Magistrate shall have the liberty to

decide the case on merit and be at liberty to fix the quantum of maintenance in accordance with law

and on the materials to be placed before him and without being influenced by this interim order. It

is desirable that the Learned Magistrate shall take all endeavours to dispose of the main

maintenance proceeding within 10 months from the date of communication of this order.

</p><p id="p_6">        Liberty is granted to the parties to pray for extension as well as for vacating the interim

order with notice to each other.
</p>
<p id="p_7">        Criminal Section is directed to supply the urgent Photostat certified copy of this order to the

party, if applied for.
