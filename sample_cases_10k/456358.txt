<p id="p_1">    The rival claim for appointment under the compassionate

scheme  of  the  first  respondent-University  between   the

petitioner and the fourth respondent has resulted in the

petitioner approaching this Court with this Writ Petition.

She is the sister of late Shri M.V.Raveendran and the

fourth respondent is his widow.     The petitioner remained

unmarried and the case of the petitioner is that she was

depending upon her brother for sustenance.  Her application

for appointment under the scheme was rejected as per Ext.P2

stating that as per various Government Orders, she is not

eligible.   In the meanwhile, the fourth respondent also

submitted   application   as   per   Ext.P3,   seeking  for

appointment  as  Lower  Division  Clerk  Grade-II  as  first

option and Computer Programmer as second option in the

University.    The   petitioner  thereafter,  filed   Ext.P4

representation  before  the  Vice  Chancellor  and,  as  the

petitioner apprehended that the fourth respondent will be

granted the appointment, this writ petition was filed.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">W.P.(C).No.34561/2005          -:2:-</span>


</p><p id="p_2">     2.     The    fourth  respondent  has  filed  a   counter

affidavit justifying her claim.
</p>
<p id="p_3">     3.     The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted

that the fourth respondent has already availed the benefit

of employment under the dying-in-harness scheme of the

State Government and as per Ext.P1 she obtained employment

as Lower Division Clerk consequent on the death of her

brother.
</p>
<p id="p_4">     4.     The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted

that since the fourth respondent is financially sound and

the   petitioner     is  only  depending  upon  her  temporary

employment in the first respondent-University, the said

fact will have to be examined by the University and after

due enquiry with regard to the financial status of the

parties etc, a decision be taken on the request of the

petitioner       regarding   the    entitlement   under    the

compassionate scheme.
</p>
<p id="p_5">     5.     Therefore,   the  writ  petition  is  disposed  of

directing the first respondent to take a decision regarding

the entitlement of the petitioner, untrammelled by the view

taken in Ext.P2, with notice to the petitioner and the

fourth respondent and, after making due enquiry regarding

the financial status of both the parties by the revenue

officers, and to pass appropriate orders.      The respondents

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">W.P.(C).No.34561/2005          -:3:-</span>


1 and 2 will be free to approach the third respondent in

the matter to get the details through the revenue officers

concerned.     The   first respondent will take  appropriate

decision within a period of two months from the date of

receipt of a copy of this Judgment.    In the peculiar facts

and circumstances of the case, till a decision is taken,

the petitioner will not be disengaged from the present

temporary employment in the University.

</p><p id="p_6">     The writ petition is disposed of as above. No costs.
