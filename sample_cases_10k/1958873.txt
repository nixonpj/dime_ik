              "From the perusal of the record it appears that
              the appellant fled away from the remand
              home. It appears that firstly, the appellant was
              handed over to his guardian for his treatment
              but he remained absent from the proceeding
              on the one pretext or other. He was not
              produced on many dates. The appellant fled
              away on 10.9.09 from the remand home. He
              remained absent till 29.4.10. From the perusal
              of the order of Juvenile Justice rejecting the
              prayer for bail of the appellant it appears that
              the order of the Hon'ble High Court passed in
              Cr. Revision no. 1111/09 was not received in
              the J.J. Board. The certified copy of the
              aforesaid order was produced only on 29.7.10
              by the appellant. Therefore, on the aforesaid
              reason the trial of the appellant could not be
              completed. Considering the facts aforesaid, I
              am not inclined to enlarge the appellant on
              bail. Accordingly, prayer for bail of the
              appellant is hereby rejected."

<p id="p_5">                 Considering all these facts emanating from record, this

Court is not inclined to enlarge the petitioner on bail. Since the

petitioner is now again lodged in the remand home, let learned trial

Court take steps to examine all the prosecution witnesses within 06

months from the date of receipt/communication of a copy of this

order in the Court below, failing which the Court below shall release

the petitioner, named above, on bail on furnishing bail bond of Rs.

10,000/- (Ten thousand) with two sureties of the like amount each to

the satisfaction of the Juvenile Justice Board, Muzaffarpur in

connection with , Trial no. 468 of 2010 ( G.R.Case no. 359 of

             sufficient/convincing explanation, the trial Court

             shall cancel the bail bond(s) of the petitioner and
