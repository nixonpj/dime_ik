tracheal injury (ante mortem) and mode of death is        asphyxia.

After postmortem, the investigation officer obtained postmortem

deceased was handed over to complainant, Vikas Gupta brother of

the deceased, for cremation vide Ex.P/10. As per information

given by accused appellant a knife (weapon of offence) was also

from the said house at the instance of accused appellant,

photographs were taken and negatives whereof are on record as

Ex.P/16 to Ex.P/37.
</p>
<p id="p_8">     After completing investigation, the investigating officer filed

charge sheet against the accused appellant in the court of learned

Addl. Chief Judicial Magistrate, Bhilwara under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_6">Sections 302</a>, <a href="/doc/1985627/" id="a_7">467</a>,

<a href="/doc/556166/" id="a_8">468</a> &amp; <a href="/doc/1466184/" id="a_9">471</a> IPC and thereafter the learned Magistrate committed

the case for trial to the court of Sessions Judge, Bhilwara. The

learned Sessions Judge, Bhilwara transferred the case for trial to

the court of learned Addl. Sessions Judge (FT) No.1, Bhilwara,

where trial commenced.
</p>
<p id="p_9">     The learned trial court after providing an opportunity framed

charge against the accused appellant for offence under Section
                                (5 of 19)
                                                          [CRLA-58/2006]

302 of <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_10">IPC</a> and thereafter proceeded to record the evidence of

prosecution. During trial, statements of 28 prosecution witnesses

were recorded and thereafter statements of accused appellant

were recorded u/s 313 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_11">Cr.P.C</a>. in which no explanation was

furnished by the accused appellant. Inspite of granting opportunity

to lead evidence, no witness was examined by the accused

appellant.
</p>
<p id="p_10">     The learned trial court after recording evidence heard final

arguments and convicted the accused appellant for committing

offence under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_12">Section 302</a> of IPC vide judgment impugned dated

06.10.2005 in Session Case No.106/2004 and passed sentence for

life along with fine of Rs.2000/- with default stipulation to further

undergo two months' rigorous imprisonment. The said judgment is

under challenge in this appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_11">     Learned amicus curiae vehemently argued that there is no

eyewitness of the incident and FIR was registered against the

accused appellant upon written complaint (Ex.P/1) filed by

complainant Vikas Gupta @ Batasha (brother of the deceased)

after delay on 20.08.2004 in which a fact was disclosed that

accused appellant made confession before one Gopal (PW.26) who

was working for construction in the house of deceased. The

accused appellant was arrested in pursuance to the FIR only on

the ground of alleged confession, which is said to be made by the

accused before the witness, Gopal (PW.26). According to learned

counsel for the appellant evidence of extra judicial confession is

weak type of evidence, therefore, conviction cannot be based

upon such confession. He, therefore, argued that the finding of
                                 (6 of 19)
                                                          [CRLA-58/2006]

guilt arrived at by the learned trial court against the appellant for

offence u/s 302 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_13">IPC</a> while relying upon the testimony of PW.26-

Gopal, is far from the truth.
</p>
<p id="p_12">     Learned amicus curiae further argued that fact of the

recovery of dead body is not supported by any independent

witness, so also, in absence of independent eyewitness of the

incident and motive, how it can be presumed that appellant has

committed an offence of murder. With regard to evidence of extra

judicial confession, it is submitted that trial court has erroneously

relied upon the testimony of PW.1- Vikas Gupta, PW.22- Ramlal,

and PW.26 Gopal, because all these witnesses gave false

statement before the court with regard to alleged confession made

by the accused appellant. The crux of the argument of learned

amicus curiae is that appellant is innocent and falsely implicated in

this case only on the basis of evidence of alleged confession and

recovery of dead body and other articles at his instance, because

there is no reliable or trustworthy evidence to prove the

prosecution case, therefore, the judgment impugned may kindly

be quashed.
</p>
<p id="p_13">     Learned amicus curiae vehemently submitted that in this

case FIR was registered on 20.08.2004 on a complaint (Ex.P/1)

submitted by the complainant, Vikas Gupta @ Batash, brother of

deceased. In the written report, a fact was disclosed that one

Ramlal informed him on telephone on 14.08.2004 that his brother,

Vishal (deceased) is missing from last 2-3 days and Raju Gupta

was living with him, is not giving any information about him, but

FIR was submitted by the complainant on 20.08.2004. As per
                                   (7 of 19)
                                                                  [CRLA-58/2006]

arguments,   it   was   the   duty     of     the   complainant    to   come

immediately at Bhilwara and to trace out his brother, deceased-

Vishal or to give information to the police, but there is no

explanation by the complainant as to why he keep on mum for six

days and gave information to the police after on 20.04.2004.

Thus, the whole prosecution story becomes doubtful.

</p><p id="p_14">     With regard to statements of Ramlal, who gave information

to Vikas Gupta nowhere said that information was given by him on

telephone to the complainant, and he has categorically stated that

he gave information on telephone to the mother of deceased-

Vishal Gupta, and mother has not been examined as witness in

this case. In the statements of Ramlal (PW.22), it is nowhere

stated by him that on which date Raju @ Rajiv Gupta came and

asked Gopal that he has already killed Vishal Gupta and will also

kill the person who gave information to the family of the deceased

at Kota. The whole prosecution case is based upon circumstantial

evidence is seriously doubtful.
</p>
<p id="p_15">     With regard to recovery of knife and other articles, it is

submitted that as per statements of the investigating officer, the

weapon-Knife was recovered from the same house, where dead

body of the deceased was recovered after 2-3 days from the date

of recovery of dead body. Learned counsel for the appellant thus

argued that a question arose when search was already made in

the house, where dead body was recovered, then why knife was

recovered after the recovery of dead body from the same house.

It is also argued that as per passbook (Ex.P/14) of the deceased,

Rs.72,950/- was the balance in the bank account but as per
                               (8 of 19)
                                                        [CRLA-58/2006]

allegations of the prosecution, a cheque of Rs.35,000/- was placed

before the bank for payment but it is not proved that said cheque

was produced for payment by the accused appellant and payment

was made to him.
</p>
<p id="p_16">     While inviting our attention towards the statements of

Premchand (PW.28) it is submitted that this witness did not

identify the accused appellant, therefore, evidence of motive is

also not reliable. Lastly, it is argued that merely on the basis of

recovery of dead body, which is one of the circumstances, the

finding of conviction is bad in the eye of law in view of judgment

rendered by Hon'ble the Supreme Court in the case Anant

Bhujangrao Kulkarni Vs. State of Maharashtra reported in AIR

1993 SC 110 and judgment of Division Bench of this Court in the

case of Nathu Vs. The State of Rajasthan reported in 1998-99

(Supp.) Cr.L.R. (Raj.) 227 and in the case of Jawahar Vs. The

State of Rajasthan reported in 1979 Cr.L.R. (Raj.) 399. Learned

counsel for the appellant also relied upon judgment of Hon'blethe

Supreme Court in the case of State of Punjab Vs. Sarup Singh

reported in 1998 Crl.L.J. 3292.
</p>
<p id="p_17">     It is argued that in the aforesaid judgments, Hon'ble the

Supreme Court and the Division Bench of this Court held that the

chain of circumstances are required to be proved beyond

reasonable doubt and conviction cannot be based only on the

basis of recovery of articles and dead body only. Therefore, the

judgment impugned may kindly be quashed and set aside because

prosecution has failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt
                                 (9 of 19)
                                                           [CRLA-58/2006]

and the accused appellant may be acquitted from the charge of

murder.
</p>
<p id="p_18">     Per contra, learned Public Prosecutor vehemently submitted

that it is a case in which deceased was brutally murdered by the

accused appellant who was living with him in the same house and

thereafter buried the dead body in the room, where construction

was going at House No.9F-36, Tilak Nagar, Bhilwara. It is also

argued that the dead body was recovered as per information given

by accused appellant. The photography as well as videography

was also taken at the time of proceedings of recovery, the entire

evidence loudly speak that dead body of deceased- Raju @ Rajiv

Gupta, was recovered at the instance of accused appellant and

none else. It is also vehemently argued by the Public Prosecutor

that there is no question to disbelieve the testimony of Gopal

(PW.26) before whom the accused appellant made extra judicial

confession, the reference of such confession was specifically

mentioned by the complainant in the written complaint (Ex.P./1)

upon which FIR was registered.
</p>
<p id="p_19">     Learned Public Prosecutor further argued that sequence of all

the facts speak that chain of circumstances right from making

extra judicial confession by the accused appellant to recovery of

dead body of the deceased as per information of the accused

appellant, has been amply proved and established beyond all

shadows of reasonable doubt that it was the accused appellant,

who has committed murder of deceased Raju @ Rajiv Gupta. It is

</p><p id="p_25">     There is no dispute that deceased- Vishal Gupta and accused

appellant- Raju @ Rajiv Gupta were residing in House No.9F-36,

Tilak Nagar, Bhilwara, where construction was going on. Further,

for the purpose of construction one Ramlal (PW.22) was deployed

who gave information to Vikas Gupta (brother of deceased) on

telephone at Kota on 14.08.2004 that his brother, Vishal Gupta is

missing from last 2-3 days and upon enquiry from Raju (accused

appellant) he is not giving any satisfactory answer. Thereafter,

complainant Vikas Gupta went Bhilwara and as per his complaint

on 19.08.2004, Ramlal informed the fact that in the evening his

nephew, namely, Gopal informed today at that 01.00 PM, Raju

came to him and asked that who gave information at Kota to the

threatened that now he will see Ramlal, who gave information and

stated that I have already done away Vikas Gupta and now he will

not leave Ramlal also.

<p id="p_26">     Upon receiving information, the formal FIR was registered

under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_17">Section 302</a> IPC against the accused appellant. It is also

evident from the fact that on the same day, the police arrested

the accused Raju @ Rajiv Gupta, at 04.45 PM and on same day

upon his information, dead body of the deceased was recovered

from the room of house No.9F-36 situated in Tilak Nagar,

Bhilwara. The dead body of Vishal Gupta was recovered from the

room,   where      it   was    buried      after    digging     the    floor.    The

investigation officer called SDM and Tehsildar on spot, and in their

presence, the dead body of the deceased was recovered. To prove

the said fact, witness Chuna Ram (PW.25), who was working as

Tehsildar, Bhilwara at that time he gave following statement with

respect to recovery of dead body in his presence on the basis of

information given by the accused appellant- Raju @ Rajiv Gupta,

      Photographs were also taken as per instructions given by the

SHO, Police Station Kotwali, Bhilwara by PW.16- Abdul Hmeed

(Photographer), and videography was also conducted at the time

of recovery of dead body. We have perused photographs taken at

the time of recovery by PW.16 Abdul Hameed, which is on record

as Ex.P/17 to Ex.P/37 and find that recovery was made in the

presence of accused appellant, and this fact is further proved by

two officers of the district administration viz. Chuna Ram, the then

Tehsilar, Bhilwara (PW.25) and Ashok Kumar, the then SDM

(PW.23). The other witnesses also proved the recovery of dead

body at the instance of accused appellant, Raju @ Rajiv Gupta

from House No.9F-36 Tilak Nagar, Bhilwara, therefore, there is no

question to disbelieve the fact that dead body was recovered at

the instance of accused appellant from the said house.</blockquote><p id="p_29">

</p><p id="p_30">      As per evidence, there is no doubt that accused appellant

Raju @ Rajiv Gupta and deceased were living together because in

defence, no such plea is taken by the appellant that he was not

living with the deceased, therefore, there is no dispute to accept

the fact that recovery of dead body at the instance of accused

appellant has been proved by the prosecution and rightly been

relied upon by the trial court so as to hold accused appellant

guilty.

<p id="p_31">      With regard to argument of learned amicus curiae that there

was no occasion to give information by accused one after another

for recovery of knife (weapon of offence) and clothes on different

dates because all the articles were recovered from the house of

the deceased on different dates after recovery of dead body. In

our opinion, the argument of learned amicus curiae that recovery

of weapon and clothes is doubtful, cannot be accepted because it

is human nature to save himself, therefore, during investigation,

information(s) were given by the accused appellant on different

date for recovery of other articles after recovery of dead body.

Therefore, there is no reason to disagree with the finding of

learned trial court that prosecution has not proved its case beyond

reasonable doubt.

under <a href="/doc/1312051/" id="a_18">Section 27</a> of the Evidence Act, dead body of deceased was

recovered in furtherance of voluntary information furnished by two

     concealed without stating that it was concealed

     concealed it. Second is that he would have seen
     somebody else concealing it. And the third is
     that he would have been told by another person
     that it was concealed there. But if the accused
     declines to tell the criminal court that his

     knowledge      about       the       concealment       was      on
     account of one of the last two possibilities, the

     concealed      by   the       accused       himself.    This     is
     because accused is the only person who can
     offer the explanation as to how else he came to
     know of such concealment and if he chooses to
     refrain from telling the Court as to how else he
     came to know of it, the presumption is a well
     justified course to be adopted by the criminal

judgment in the case of State of Maharashtra Vs. Suresh (Supra)

      judgment. There is no merit in the submissions

</p><p id="p_42">      We have perused the judgment cited by the learned amicus

curiae of the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Anant Bhujangrao

Kulkarni (supra), and in the case of State of Punjab Vs. Sarup

Singh (supra). In both these cases, the facts were altogether

different. In the case of Anant Bhujangrao Kulkarni (supra), the

dead body was found near the portion of building occupied by the

accused appellant, but here in this case, the dead body was

recovered from the room, in which accused appellant himself was

living along with deceased, therefore, the facts of that case are

altogether different.
</p>
<p id="p_43">      In the case of State of Punjab Vs. Sarup Singh (supra), the

said was based upon evidence of last seen together and question

of recovery of dead body at the instance of accused appellant was

not in question. Therefore, the said judgment is no avail and not

applicable in the case in hand. So far as the two other judgments

in the case of Nathu (supra) and in the case of Jawahar (supra) of

Division Bench of this Court, are concerned, we have no hesitation

to observe that both these judgments are altogether different

upon facts of the case, therefore, are not relevant so as to accept

the arguments of learned amicus curiae for acquittal.

</p><p id="p_44">      Upon assessment of entire evidence and the fact that

prosecution has proved the recovery of dead body and other

articles   at   the   instance   of   accused    appellant   by   leading

trustworthy evidence of independent witnesses, who were present
                                (19 of 19)
                                                          [CRLA-58/2006]

at the time of recovery and gave statements before the court that

accused appellant present in the court, was present at the time of

recovery of the dead body from the House No.9F-36, Tilak Nagar,

Bhilwara upon his information. Photography of the recovery of the

proceedings was also made, loudly speaks that appellant was very

much present at the time of recovery of dead body and the dead

body was recovered as per information given by accused

appellant. Therefore, we are of the opinion that no error has been

committed by the trial court so as to convict the accused appellant

for committing offence of murder of Vishal Gupta (deceased).

</p><p id="p_45">       In view of above discussion, we are of the opinion that

finding of conviction recorded by the learned Additional Sessions

Judge (Fast Track) No.1, Bhilwara vide judgment dated 06 th of

October 2005 does not suffer from any illegality as the same is

based upon sound appreciation of evidence led by the prosecution.
