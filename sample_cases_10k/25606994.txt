:ORDER  
</pre>
<p id="p_1">        The petitioner has filed this writ petition for issuance of Writ of
Certiorarified Mandamus calling for the records relating to the impugned
order of the first respondent in ref. Na.Ka.No: E3/A.V.No:90/06 NP dated
17.10.2007 of the first respondent and quash the same and consequently
forbearing the respondents their men, agents, servants, officials and
subordinates from in any manner interfering with the peaceful possession and
enjoyment of the property measuring 3272.5 sq.feet. in S.No:628/1A, new
S.No:725/1, T.S.No:88, new T.S.No:114, Sivakasi Village, Sivakasi,
Virudhunagar District.
</p>
<p id="p_2">        2.The case of the petitioner is that he purchased a housing plot
measuring 3272.5 sq.feet. in S.No:628/1A, new S.No:725/1, T.S.No:88, new 
T.S.No:114, Sivakasi Village, Sivakasi, Virudhunagar District under a
registered sale deed dated 6.7.1995. The above said housing plot forms part
of a larger extent of plot approved for lay out by the 2nd respondent. On
11.7.1994 the 2nd respondent Municipality granted approval for building plan.
In pursuance of the said approval, several shops were constructed in the said
area. After construction, there was a registered partition deed was effected
between the family members on 19.1.1995. As stated above, the petitioner has
purchased a housing plot under a registered sale deed. The possession of the
property has been vested with the petitioner?s vendor from the date of
partition and before that from 1962 onwards possession was with their
ancestors. After sale, the possession and enjoyment is exclusively with the
petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_3">        3.While so, after 10 years of petitioner?s purchase, the 1st respondent
herein issued an order dated 30.6.05 stating that Patta stood in the
petitioner?s name has been reclassified as poromboke. On coming to know the 
same the petitioner filed W.P.No:7298/05 before this Hon?ble Court. This
Hon?ble Court by order dated 10.8.05 set aside the above said order with a
direction to the first respondent to give opportunity to the petitioner and
pass orders on merits thereafter.
</p>
<p id="p_4">        4.The first respondent herein conducted enquiry after affording
opportunity to the petitioner herein and passed the impugned order on
17.10.07 and the same is challenged in this writ petition on the ground that
the first respondent has no jurisdiction to pass the impugned order and he
has usurping the powers of the competent authorities. The petitioner further
stated that the Patta issued by the 3rd respondent herein stood in the name
of the owner of the property ought to be cancelled only by due process of
law. Like that the building plan approval granted by the Local Town Planning
Authority could be cancelled only after issuing show cause notice and
following due process of law.
</p>
<p id="p_5">        5.The 2nd respondent Municipality has filed counter affidavit and
contended that the lay out was approved by appropriate authority and
consequently proper orders were passed by the 2nd respondent. The previous 
owner of the property managed to get the revenue records mutuated to their
name. Immediately after reservation of the property for public purpose in the
approved layout plan, the property was classified in the revenue record as
play ground. It is for the petitioner to establish before this Hon?ble Court
as to how the said classification was transferred and mutuated to the name of
the previous owner of the property. The 2nd respondent herein on the basis of
the mutuated revenue records along with title deeds submitted by the previous
owner of the property order granting building plan approval on 13.07.1994.
However no construction was carried on in accordance with the said plan
approval and the construction was also not completed within the time
stipulated in the plan approval order. Therefore the approved plan got lapsed
on 15.07.1997 itself. The construction made now is without any building plan
approval and the same is in violation of the provisions of Tamil Nadu
District Municipalities Act 1920. The petitioner cannot claim any right over
the building plan approval granted by the 2nd respondent to the previous
owner of the property. The petitioner has no right over the public property
and he cannot claim ownership over the same and the relief sought for the
dismissal of the writ petition.
</p>
<p id="p_6">        6.Heard M.R.Vijayakumar, learned counsel appearing for the petitioner
and Mr.Aayiram K.Selvakumar, learned counsel appearing for the respondents 1 
and 3 and Mr.N.Dilip kumar, learned counsel appearing for the second
respondent.
</p>
<p id="p_7">        7.The learned counsel for the petitioner argued that in the impugned
order it is stated by the first respondent that admittedly there are
violations by the competent authorities for giving approval to the building
plan, issuance of patta etc.,. But the 1st respondent failed to take any
legal action against the said authorities for their violation. Further the
learned counsel for the petitioner argued that before cancellation of the
Patta stood in the name of the petitioner, and cancellation of building plan
approval, the competent authorities should have called the petitioner for
enquiry by issuing show cause notice. But in the present case, the first
respondent without following the procedure adumbrated under law, has passed
erroneous order and the same is liable to be quashed. The learned counsel
further argued that the first respondent can?t take away the powers of his
subordinates merely because he happens to be the superior authority. The
first respondent herein should permit the authorities to exercise their
powers independently which are conferred to them under law. The first
respondent has no jurisdiction to cancel the building plan permission granted
by the Municipality on 14.7.1994.
</p>
<p id="p_8">        8.On the other hand, the learned standing counsel appearing for the 2nd
respondent Municipality has argued that no interference is called for in the
impugned order, since the first respondent is having power and jurisdiction
to pass the impugned order.
</p>
<p id="p_9">9.I have gone through the affidavit, counter affidavit and the documents
filed on both side. I have also perused the report of the learned advocate
commissioner. I have also perused the impugned order of the 1st respondent
dated 17.10.2007.  A bare perusal of the impugned order discloses about the
irregularities committed by the authorities namely the Revenue Officials and
the Municipal Authorities. The 1st respondent has stated in the impugned
order that the Tahsildar of Sattur Taluk has wrongly issued Patta for the
Government Poromboke Land and further it is stated in the impugned order that
the 2nd respondent Municipality has sanctioned building plan approval, even
after knowing about the fact that as per the approved layout the building
constructed area is mentioned as Park and Children Play Ground. The Sub- 
Registrar has also registered the sale deed of the petitioner though he had
knowledge about the settlement register furnished by the Revenue Officials
wherein the property purchased by the petitioner is mentioned as Poromboke
Land.
</p>
<p id="p_10">10.The 1st respondent herein without resorting to initiate disciplinary
proceedings for the irregularities committed by the revenue and municipal
authorities, have cancelled the Patta stands in the name of the petitioner
and cancelled the building plan approval by confirming his earlier order
dated 30.06.2005 as the property of the petitioner is Government Poromboke
land in the impugned order. There is a force in the arguments advanced by the
Learned counsel for the petitioner in that regard. Further while coming to
the jurisdiction of the 1st respondent in taking away the powers of the
respondent 2 &amp; 3 herein, I have to accept the argument of the Learned counsel
for the petitioner. Here it is useful to refer the Tamil Nadu Patta Pass Book
Act 1983.  As per Section 10 of the Patta Pass Book Act 1983, the power to
transfer, cancel and modify the patta is given to the Tahsildar of respective
Taluk. As against the order of the Tahsildar, Appeal is provided under
Section 12 of the said act and further Revision is provided under Section 13
of the Tamil Nadu Patta Pass Book Act 1983. But in the present case, the
petitioner was not provided such opportunities and the powers conferred under
the Tamil Nadu Patta Pass Book Act were taken away by the 1st respondent  
herein. The 1st respondent cannot usurped the powers statutorily granted to
the authorities under the said act.  Hence I have no hesitation to hold that
the 1st respondent herein is not having jurisdiction to pass the impugned
order. In that aspect it is useful to refer the Judgment reported in 2013 (2)
CTC page 129 wherein it is held by the Division Bench of our Hon?ble High
Court that the power given to an authority under an Act or Rule has to be
exercised strictly only in accordance with the mode provided therein. Suo
Motu Revision when can be made. Suo Motu Revision can be exercised when there   
is no appeal provided. Order that could be appealed under <a href="/doc/195458/" id="a_2">section 15</a> of Tamil
Nadu Estate (Abolition and Conversion into Ryotwari) Act 1948 could not be
revised by invoking Suo Motu Revision power. The above Judgment is squarely
applicable to the facts of the present case on hand.
</p>
<p id="p_11">11.The next point canvassed by the Learned Counsel for the Petitioner is that
the 2nd respondent Municipality has granted building plan approval on
14.07.1994 and the same was cancelled by the impugned order of the 1st 
respondent on 17.10.2007 after lapse of 13 years. Further the cancellation of
building plan approval can be done by the competent authorities that too
after giving show cause notice to the petitioner as per the Tamil Nadu
District Municipalities Act 1920. In the present case admittedly no show
cause notice was issued by the 2nd respondent Municipality to the petitioner.
Here also the 1st respondent has usurped the power of other competent
authorities having independent jurisdiction and the same is unsustainable in
law, unconstitutional, illegal and arbitrary and so the impugned order is
also liable to be quashed on the ground of delay also.
</p>
<p id="p_12">12.While coming to the counter affidavit filed by the 2nd respondent
municipality, they have specifically admitted that the layout was approved by
the 2nd respondent Municipality and subsequent building plan approval order
was also granted by them. But the 2nd respondent Municipality sustained the
impugned order on the ground saying that they have granted building plan
approval unknowingly on the basis of mutuated revenue records and title deeds
submitted by the previous owner of the property. The said contention of the
2nd respondent cannot be accepted for the simple reason that having admitted
the fact of approved layout plan issued by them and building plan approval
granted by the Municipality, now cannot turnover and say that they have given
the approval only on the basis of revenue records and title deeds. Further
the 2nd respondent has not answer for the issue of jurisdiction point raised
by the petitioner. The Learned Counsel for the 2nd respondent has relied on
the following judgments to support his case.
</p><p id="p_13">1) 2007 (3) MLJ 1990
</p><p id="p_14">2) 2007 (4) CTC 67
</p><p id="p_15">3) 2004 (3) CTC 251
</p><p id="p_16">4) 2007(4) SCC 54 

</p><p id="p_17">13.All the above judgments are dealing with the preposition of the properties
set apart for public purpose. Therefore the above said judgments are not
helpful to the case of the 2nd respondent and those judgments are not
applicable to the facts of the present case.
</p>
<p id="p_18">14.Apart from that the 1st respondent herein who passed the impugned order,
has not at all filed any counter to sustain the impugned order. Hence I am of
the considered view that the impugned order is liable to be quashed. In
accordingly, the impugned order passed by the 1st respondent in ref.
Na.Ka.No: E3/A.V.No:90/06 NP dated 17.10.2007 has to be set aside.  
</p>
<p id="p_19">15.The contention of the respondents is that the petitioner has constructed
the building by violating the plan approval order.  If at all any violation
the power is given to the Municipality to rectify the mistake on filing
revised building plan application by the petitioner.  Even the petitioner can
be directed to file revised building plan application and for that the
petitioner cannot be thrown away into the street by passing impugned order.
If the 2nd respondent wants to take action for the violation of the building
plan, they can have to do the same as per their law.
</p>
<p id="p_20">16.In the result, the writ petition is allowed by set aside the impugned
order in ref.Na.Ka.E3/A.V.No.90/06 (NP) dated 17.10.2007 on the file of the
first respondent.  There is no order as to cost. Consequently connected
miscellaneous petitions are closed.
