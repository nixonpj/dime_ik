HEREIN, VIDE ANNEXURE N. AND TO STAY ALL FURTHER

ABOVE WRIT PETITION.

    THIS PETITION COMING ON FOR PRELIMINARY
HEARING THIS DAY, THE COURT MADE THE FOLLOWING:


                          ORDER
</pre>

<p id="p_1">       Petitioner has called in question the order of the Land

Tribunal, Ranebennur, dated 19.02.2004.



</p><p id="p_2">       2.    The deceased respondent No.3 had made an

application under Section 45 of the Karnataka Land Reforms

Act, in Form No.7 inter alia claiming grant of occupancy

rights in his favour. However, during the pendency of the

proceeding before the Land Tribunal, he died and his legal

representatives R3(a) and R3(b) were brought on record. The

Land   Tribunal,   by   the   impugned   order,   has   granted

occupancy rights in favour of respondent Nos.3(a) and 3(b).

As against the said order, the petitioner is before this Court.



</p><p id="p_3">       3.    The facts, which are not in dispute are that, the

deceased respondent No.3 had made an application in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                :4:</span>


respect of land bearing Sy. Nos.12/1 and 9/1 measuring 7

Acres 22 guntas and 4 Acres 27 guntas of Sanna Sangapura

Village.   Earlier,   the   Land   Tribunal,   by   order   dated

26.09.1977, had rejected the application of the deceased

respondent No.3 as against which, respondent No.3 had filed

writ petition in W.P. No.20965/1993. This Court, by order

dated 29th September 1999, quashed the order of the Land

Tribunal and remitted the matter to the Tribunal for fresh

enquiry.     Before the Tribunal,     Respondent Nos.3(a) and

3(b) produced the record of rights for the period from 1950-

1951 to 1973-1974, wherein the name of the deceased

respondent No.3 is shown in Column No.12(2) as the person

cultivating the land as a tenant. Respondent No.3 had taken

the land on lease for a period of sixteen years on payment of

rent at Rs.62.50Ps. per year and in this regard, he had paid

Rs.1,000/- as advance lease amount.
</p>
<p id="p_4">

</p><p id="p_5">      4.     Considering the entry of the name of the

deceased respondent No.3 in cultivators` column and the

registered lease deed, wherein the deceased respondent No.3
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                :5:</span>


was a lessee, the Land Tribunal has granted occupancy

rights to the legal representatives of respondent No.3.   On

the contrary, no evidence is produced to show or deny the

said facts in this writ petition.
</p>
<p id="p_6">

</p><p id="p_7">      5.     Petitioners claims that, out of five members of

the Tribunal, only three members have signed the order.

Therefore, the impugned order is illegal. Further, the copy of

the order was not sent to the petitioners as required under

Section 48(A) (6) if the Karnataka Land Reforms Act, and

lease deed produced by respondents 3(a) and 3(b) dated

10.05.1949 is not a lease, but it is a mortgage.



</p><p id="p_8">      6.     On interpretation of the documents, it is found

that, though the document, stipulates payment of rent at the

rate of Rs.62.50Ps. per year and in this regard, Rs.1,000/-

was received in advance, there is nothing to suggest that the

said document amounts to a mortgage. Nor it is the case of

the petitioners that they had sought for redemption of the

mortgage.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                               :6:</span><p id="p_9">


</p><p id="p_10">      7.    Having   regard    to   the   material    documents

produced by respondents 2 and 3, the Tribunal has

conferred the occupancy rights in their favour.      I do not find

that, there is any error in the order passed by the Land

Tribunal.
</p>
<p id="p_11">
</p><p id="p_12">      Accordingly, the petition stands dismissed.


</p><p id="p_13">                                SD/-
</p><p id="p_14">                               JUDGE
