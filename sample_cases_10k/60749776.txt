      Shri Anil Mishra, Advocate for the appellant.
      Shri R.P.Rathi, Govt. Advocate for the respondents/
State.
      Heard.
2.    The appellants have filed this appeal against the
order dt.31.10.2014 passed in W.P.No.3656/2014.
3.    Facts</pre><p id="p_1"> of the case have been mentioned in detail by
the Writ Court, hence, it is not necessary to consider the
facts in detail.
</p><p id="p_2">4.    The question for consideration in this Writ Appeal is
as to whether the provisions of Section 405 of M.P.
Municipal Corporation Act, 1956 (hereinafter referred to
as "Act of 1956") would be applicable in the facts and
circumstances of the case.
</p><p id="p_3">5.    The    Governor      of   Madhya   Pradesh   issued   a
notification dt.6.11.2012 in exercise of power under
Section 405 (3) of the Act of 1956 to the effect that some
areas as mentioned in Column No.3 of Schedule I of the
notification would be included in the existing limits of the
Municipal Corporation Gwalior. In accordance with the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                       2                        W.A.No.286/2014</span>

notification, 76 villages were included within the limits of
Municipal Corporation, Gwalior.
</p><p id="p_4">6.   After issuance of notification dt.6.11.2012, Collector
Gwalior vide letter        dt.11.2.2013 initiated process of
extension of wards and formation of new wards in
accordance    with   the    procedure    of    Madhya    Pradesh
Municipal Corporation (Extent of Wards) Rules, 1994
(hereinafter referred to "Rules of 1994"). Appellant No.2
submitted an objection about the de-limitation of wards.
Copy of the same was filed as Annexure P/5 before the Writ
Court. Other persons also submitted objections in regard
to de-limitation of wards. Those objections were decided by
the Commissioner and a committee constituted by the
Collector with the approval of Commissioner, Gwalior
Division Gwalior. Finally Commissioner approved the
proposal of addition of 61 to 66 wards to existing 60 wards
of the Corporation in exercise of powers under Section 10
of the Act of 1956 vide notification dt.25.1.2014. It was
notified in the gazette.
</p><p id="p_5">7.   Learned     counsel     appearing    on    behalf   of   the
appellants has contended that the Commissioner, Collector
and the Committee were not empowered to decide the
objections raised by the appellant No.2 and other persons.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                      3                       W.A.No.286/2014</span>

<p id="p_6">Those objections had to be decided by the Governor in
accordance with the procedure prescribed under Section
405 of the Act of 1956. He further submitted that because
the provisions have not been complied with, hence,
notification of election is contrary to law. In support of his
contentions, learned counsel relied on the judgment passed
by the main seat in W.P.No.12777/2014, order passed in
Review Petition No.667/2014 and also another judgment
passed by the Indore Bench in W.P.No.3538/2014.
</p><p id="p_7">8.   Contrary to this, learned Government Advocate
appearing   on   behalf   of   the   respondents/State    has
contended that the provisions of Section 405 of the Act of
1956 would not be applicable in the present case because
it was not a case of inclusion or exclusion of certain limits
of the city of Municipal Corporation. It was a case of de-
limitation and formation of wards and provisions of Section
10 of the Act of 1956 would be applicable.
</p><p id="p_8">9.   Section 405 of the Act of 1956 prescribes power of
Governor to include or exclude certain area of the
Municipal Corporation. Aforesaid section reads as under :-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">      "405. Power of Governor to include or
      exclude certain area.-(1) The Governor may,
      be notification in the gazette, declare the
      intention to include within or exclude from
      the limits of the city, any specified area.
</blockquote><span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                      4                      W.A.No.286/2014</span>

<blockquote id="blockquote_2">       (2) If the local authority having jurisdiction in
       the said area or any person resident therein,
       objects to such declaration, such authority or
       person may submit an objection in writing to
       the Collector "within a prescribed period" and
       Governor shall take such objection into
       consideration.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">       (3) When the said period has expired and
       the Governor has considered the objection
       under sub-section (2), the Governor may by
       notification, include within or exclude from
       the limits of the city any specified area.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">              Provided that when an area is excluded
       from the limits of any municipal area, such
       area notwithstanding such exclusion shall
       continue to be within the limits of the
       municipal area until the area so excluded is
       included in a duly constituted Panchayat
       area."
</blockquote><p id="p_9">10.   Section   10   of   the   Act   of   1956     prescribes
determination of number and extent of wards and conduct
of elections. Aforesaid section reads as under :-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_5">       "10. Determination of number and extent
       of wards and conduct of elections.-(1) The
       State Government shall from time to time, by
       notification in the official gazette, determine
       the number and extent of wards to be
       constituted in each municipal area :
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_6">             Provided that the total number of wards
       shall not be more than seventy and not less
       than forty in any municipal area.
       (2) Only one Councillor shall be elected from
       each wards.
</blockquote><span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                        5                     W.A.No.286/2014</span>

<blockquote id="blockquote_7">       (3) The formation of the wards shall be made
       in such a way that the population of each of
       the wards shall, so for as practicable, be the
       same throughout the city and the area
       included in the ward is compact.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_8">       (4) As soon as the formation of wards of a
       municipal area is completed, the same shall
       be reported by the State Government to the
       State Election Commission."
</blockquote><p id="p_10">11.   For the purpose to regulate the extent of wards, the
State Government in exercise of powers conferred by
Section 433 of the Act of 1956 has formulated the rules
named as Madhya Pradesh Municipal Corporation (Extent
of Wards) Rules, 1994 (hereinafter referred to "Rules of
1994").
</p><p id="p_11">12.   From the reading of Section 405 of the Act of 1956, it
is clear that the section is applicable when there is an
intention to include or exclude certain area within the
limits of Municipal Corporation. 60 villages were included
within the limits of Municipal Corporation vide notification
dt.6.11.2012 and that procedure is over. The challenge in
the present petition is not the inclusion of certain area
within the limits of Municipal Corporation Gwalior. The
challenge   in   the   present   petition   is   in   regard   to
determination of numbers and extent of wards, which is
governed by Section 10 of the Act of 1956. Hence, the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                            6                         W.A.No.286/2014</span>

provisions contained in Section 405 of the Act of 1956
would not be applicable in the facts and circumstances of
the present case. The arguments advanced by the learned
counsel for the appellants to this extent are misconceived
and the judgments relied by the learned counsel for the
appellants     are        not    applicable   in     the   facts    and
circumstances        of    the    present     case    because      those
judgments are in regard to exercise of power of Governor
under Section 405 of the Act of 1956. In the present case,
the provisions of Section 10 of the Act of 1956 and Rules of
1994 would be applicable and those rules have been
followed by the authorities.
</p><p id="p_12">13.   Learned Writ Court has considered in detail and held
that the procedure was followed by the authorities in
accordance with the Rules of 1994 and Section 10 of the
Act of 1994 in de-limitation of the wards. Hence, the order
passed by the Writ Court could not be said to be arbitrary
and illegal.
</p><p id="p_13">14.   It is also a fact that election procedure has been
started and the election process is going on. Hon'ble
Supreme Court in Election Commission of India Vs.
Ashok Kumar reported in (2000) 8 SCC 216 has held as
under in regard to interference in the election matters by
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                           7                   W.A.No.286/2014</span>

     the court :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_9">            "28. Election disputes are not just private,
            civil disputes between two parties. Though
            there is an individual or a few individuals
            arrayed as parties before the court but the
            stakes of the constituency as a whole are on
            trial. Whichever way the lis terminates it
            affects the fate of the constituency and the
            citizens generally. A conscientious approach
            with overriding consideration for welfare of
            the constituency and strengthening the
            democracy is called for. Neither turning a
            blind eye to the controversies which have
            arisen nor assuming a role of overenthusiastic
            activist would do. The two extremes have to
            be avoided in dealing with election disputes."
</blockquote><p id="p_14">     15.   Considering the facts and circumstances of the case,
     in our opinion, the Writ Court has not committed any error
     of jurisdiction of law. We do not find any merit in this
     appeal. It is hereby dismissed.
</p><p id="p_15">           No order as to costs.
