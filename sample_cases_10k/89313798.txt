HIGH COURT OF JUDICATURE AT ALLAHABAD, LUCKNOW BENCH
 
 

?Court No. - 17
 

 
Case :- SERVICE SINGLE No. - 23899 of 2019
 

 
Petitioner :- Manoj Kumar
 
Respondent :- State Of U.P. Thru Prin.Secy. Law &amp; Justice/Legal And Ors.
 
Counsel for Petitioner :- Surya Narayan Mishra,Maheep Kumar Singh
 
Counsel for Respondent :- C.S.C.,Gaurav Mehrotra
 

 
Hon'ble Chandra Dhari Singh,J.
</pre> 
<p id="p_1">By means of this petition, the petitioner has prayed for the following reliefs.
</p> 
<p id="p_2">1. issue a writ order or direction in the nature of certiorari thereby quashing the impugned advertisement dated 09.08.2019 issued the Registrar General, High Court of Judicature at Allabahad, so far as it relates to counting the date of age limit 45 years since 01.01.2020 (contained as Annexure 1 to this writ petition), in the interest of law and justice. 
</p> 
<p id="p_3">2. Issue a writ order or direction in the nature of mandamus thereby commanding to the concerned authorities to count the date of age limit of 45 years from 01.01.2019 in place of 01.01.2020 as counted in the 2018 Part-1 and 2018 Part-2 in direct recruitment of the Uttar Pradesh Higher Judicial Service. 
</p> 
<p id="p_4">3. Issue a writ order or direction in the nature of Mandamus thereby commanding to the opposite parties to allow to the petitioner to appear and participate in direct recruitment of the Uttar Pradesh Higher Judicial Service - 2018 (Part-III) in the interest of justice. 
</p> 
<p id="p_5">Learned counsel for the petitioner has submitted that the opposite parties are violative of the fundamental rights of the petitioner. It has also been submitted that as per the notification of the advertisement it may be seen that the same is for direct recruitment to the U.P. Higher Judicial Service 2018 (Part 3) and therefore, as per Rule, the calculation of the age 45 should be made on the first day of January next following the year i.e. since 01.01.2019 in place of 01.01.2020. Learned counsel further submitted that the calculation of age was made since 01.01.2019 therefore in the part-3 there is no occasion to calculate the same since 01.01.2020. Learned counsel also submitted that the U.P. Higher Judicial Service 2019, the petitioner having no case but the notification is for the U.P. Higher Judicial Service 2018 (Part II) and therefore, as per the rule, the calculation of age 48 years should be made on the first day of January next following the year i.e. since 01.01.2019 in place of 01.01.2020. Learned counsel for the petitioner has submitted that the advertisement has been made against the rules and therefore, the same is not sustainable in the eyes of law. 
</p> 
<p id="p_6">Per contra, learned Standing Counsel has vehemently opposed the submissions made by the learned counsel for the petitioner and submitted that the issue involved in the present writ petition had already been decided by this Court sitting at Allahabad in number of petitions including the Writ - A No.13017 of 2019. Order dated 19.08.2019 passed in Writ -A No.13017 of 2019 reads as under:
</p> 
<p id="p_7">Heard Sri Narendra Pratap Singh, learned counsel for the petitioner and Sri Ashish Mishra, learned counsel appearing for the respondents. 
</p> 
<p id="p_8">The petitioner by means of this writ petition is seeking a direction to provisionally permit him to appear in the U.P. Higher Judicial Service, 2018 Part-III by giving 5 years of age relaxation to him as an Ex-Serviceman as is being provided to the SC, ST and OBC candidates. 
</p> 
<p id="p_9">In this regard Rule 12 of the U.P. Higher Judicial Service Rules, 1975 is relevant which is reproduced herein below for the sake of convenience:- 
</p> 
<p id="p_10">"12. Age-A candidate for direct recruitment must have attained the age of 35 years and must not have attained the age of 45 years on the first day of January next following the year in which the notice inviting applications is published; 
</p> 
<p id="p_11">Provided that the upper age limit shall be higher by three years in case of candidates belonging to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and such other categories as may be notified by the Government from time to time." 
</p> 
<p id="p_12">A plain reading of the aforesaid Rule reveals that the maximum age limit for appearing in the Higher Judicial Service is 45 years for general category of candidates as on the first day of January next following the year in which the notice inviting applications is published. The said age limit has been relaxed by 3 years only for SC and ST candidates. 
</p> 
<p id="p_13">There is no notification of the State Government providing any age relaxation for any other category of candidates much less the Ex-Serviceman. 
</p> 
<p id="p_14">Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the Ministry of Personnel Public Grievance of Pension vide notification dated 4th October 2012 has provided for age relaxation for Ex-Serviceman. 
</p> 
<p id="p_15">The aforesaid notification is not in respect any service of the State Government. The Government competent to notify the age relaxation under Rule 12 is the Government of U.P. 
</p> 
<p id="p_16">The definition of the Government as provided in Rule 3(b) of the Rules refers to the Government of U.P., and not to the Union Government. Therefore, notification issued by the Central Government providing for age relaxation to Ex-Serviceman is not applicable to the recruitment made under the U.P. Higher Judicial Service Rules, 1975. 
</p> 
<p id="p_17">In view of the aforesaid facts and circumstances, we find no merit in the petition and the same is dismissed. 
</p> 
<p id="p_18">Learned counsel for the petitioner has submitted that against the orders passed by this Hon'ble Court at Allahabad, Special Leave Petition has been filed before Hon'ble the Apex Court but he has admitted that no orders have been passed as yet. 
</p> 
<p id="p_19">In view of the above, I do not find any reason to interfere in the matter as the issue involved in the instant writ petition had already been adjudicated by this court sitting at Allahabad.
</p> 
<p id="p_20">Accordingly, the writ petition is dismissed in terms of the order dated 19.08.2019 passed in Writ-A No.13017 of 2019 (supra). 
</p> 
<p id="p_21">Order Date :- 3.9.2019/VNP/-
