CORAM: HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE JASWANT SINGH

Present:    Mr. G.P.S.Randhawa, Advocate for the petitioner.

            Mrs. Sudeepti Sharma, Deputy Advocate General, Punjab
            for the respondents/State.
                               ****

JASWANT SINGH, J. (Oral)
</pre>
<p id="p_1">            The petitioner-Baldev Singh claims to have been recruited as a

Constable for Police District Batala. He has challenged his transfer from

Police District Batala to District Jalandhar (Rural), vide impugned order

dated 29.02.2016 (Annexure P-1), issued by the Office of Director General

of Police, Punjab (for short "DGP").
</p>
<p id="p_2">            Upon notice, reply by way of an affidavit dated 29.07.2016 of

Sh. Inderbir Singh, Asstt. Inspector General of Police (Personnel-2), Punjab

on behalf of the respondents has been filed, which is taken on record. Copy

of the same has been supplied to learned opposite Counsel.

</p><p id="p_3">            Learned Counsel for the petitioner has raised an argument based

on Rule 12.26 of the Punjab Police Rules, whereby for an inter-district

transfer, the sanction of both the Deputy Inspector Generals concerned is

required. He submits that since no such sanction was obtained from the DIG

(Jalandhar Range), the impugned transfer order is liable to be quashed.

</p><p id="p_4">            On the other hand, learned State Counsel has argued that with

the enforcement of the Punjab Police Act, 2007, the seniority of the

                                1 of 2

Constables is maintained at the State level and, therefore, no prejudice has

been caused to the petitioner on his transfer, which remains a incidence of

service.
</p>
<p id="p_5">            After hearing learned Counsel for the parties, no case for

interference is made out.
</p>
<p id="p_6">            A reading of the Rule 12.26, as reproduced in Para 4 of the writ

petition, reveals that it is provided that sanction of both the DIGs concerned

is required i.e. from the range where the Constable was earlier posted and

where he/she is sought to be transferred. However, the requirement is, at

best, only directory for the sake of administrative reason of the two ranges.

Its violation, if any, in the changed circumstances would neither be

prejudicial to the seniority of the Constable nor would vest the

employee/Constable a right to seek the strict enforcement of the said Rule,

much less any right to question the transfer on such basis. That apart, the

transfer order was passed by the DGP, who is the head of the entire Police

Department and, therefore, it has to be construed that there was a substantial

compliance of Rule 12.26. There is another aspect to the matter, the

petitioner was transferred, vide order dated 29.02.2016 (P-1) and he is yet to

join at his new place of posting. Needless to say, in a disciplined force, such

a conduct would make him liable for disciplinary proceedings.

</p><p id="p_7">                In view of the above, the present petition stands dismissed.
