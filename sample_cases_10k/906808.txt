               Dated this the 13th day of August, 2010

                                O R D E R
</pre>
<p id="p_1">            R.P.No.213/2008 is filed by the third respondent in the

writ petition while R.P.No.706/2010 is filed by the petitioner

himself. As per the judgment of this Court, the writ petition has

been finally disposed of directing the petitioner to approach the

Arbitrator for being furnished with copies of the awards passed

under Section 69 of the Kerala Co-operative Societies Act, 1969.

It has been further directed that if he so approaches the Arbitrator,

copies of the award shall be furnished to him within a period of two

weeks thereafter.      The petitioner has been given the liberty to

pursue the statutory remedies thereafter. The third respondent is

aggrieved by the liberty that has been given to the writ petitioner to

pursue his statutory remedies which are barred by time. The writ

petitioner is aggrieved by the fact that his contentions on the

merits have not been considered by this Court. Therefore, he

prays for consideration and disposal of the writ petition on merits.

It is worth noticing that though the judgment of this Court is dated

RP.213/08 &amp; 706/10
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                  : 2 :</span>


18-01-2008, the petitioner has not complied with the directions

therein.
</p>
<p id="p_2">      2.     According to the counsel for the third respondent in the

writ petition, granting a further opportunity to the petitioner to avail

the statutory remedies that are already time barred would only give

him another opportunity to protract matters. It is submitted that 57

awards have been passed against the fourth respondent, that the

execution of the said awards are being challenged by the

petitioner and, therefore, the writ petition may be considered and

disposed of on merits. Since the conduct of the petitioner in not

complying with the directions in the judgment of this Court further

supports the contentions urged by the respondents in the writ

petition, I am inclined to allow these Review Petitions.

</p><p id="p_3">      3.     Accordingly, these Review Petitions are allowed. The

judgment of this Court sought to be reviewed, is set aside.

</p><p id="p_4">      Post the writ petition for hearing immediately after Onam

holidays.
