            living expenses. The amount was calculated at Rs.38,400/- per
            year. She was 35/36 years old, so, multiplier of 15 was applied. The
            amount of dependency was assessed at Rs.5,76,000/-. Besides
            this, a sum of Rs.5000/- was awarded for funeral expenses and
            transportation of dead body. Rs.10,000/- were awarded for loss of
            consortium. In all, compensation of Rs.5,91,000/- was awarded to
            the claimants along with interest at the rate of 7.5% per annum from
            the date of filing of claim application till its realization.

                                estimation of the value of services rendered to the
                                house by the housewives, which has been arrived at
                                Rs. 12,000/- per annum in case of some and Rs.
                                10,000/- for others, appears to us to be grossly low. It
                                is true that the claimants, who ought to have given
                                datas for determination of compensation, did not
                                assist in any manner by providing the datas for
                                estimating the value of services rendered by such
                                housewives. But even in the absence of such datas
                                and taking into consideration the multifarious services
                                rendered by the housewives for managing the entire
                                family, even on a modest estimation, should be Rs.
                                3000/- per month and Rs. 36,000/- per annum. This
                                would apply to all those housewives between the age
                                group of 34 to 59 and as such who were active in life.
                                The compensation awarded, therefore, should be re-
                                calculated, taking the value of services rendered per
                                annum to be Rs. 36,000/- and thereafter applying the
                                multiplier, as has been applied already, and so far as
                                the conventional amount is concerned, the same
                                should be Rs. 50,000/- instead of Rs. 25,000/- given
                                under the Report. So far as the elderly ladies are
                                concerned, in the age group of 62 to 72, the value of
                                services rendered has been taken at Rs. 10,000/- per
                                annum and multiplier applied is eight. Though, the
                                multiplier applied is correct, but the value of services
                                rendered at Rs. 10,000/- per annum, cannot be held to
                                be just and, we therefore, enhance the same to Rs.
                                20,000/- per annum. In their case, therefore, the total
                                amount of compensation should be re-determined,
                                taking the value of services rendered at Rs. 20,000/-
                                per annum and then after applying the multiplier, as
                                already applied and thereafter adding Rs. 50,000/-
                                towards the conventional figure.

            amount of compensation comes to 7,20,000/- (48000x15). Amount

            awarded Rs.1 lac to the wife on account of death of her husband
            who was 33 years of age. For ready reference, paragraph No.20 of

                                Devi, 2012 ACJ 1428 (SC). We may, therefore,
                                revisit the practice of awarding compensation

                                the same needs to be increased. In Sarla Verma's
                                case, 2009 ACJ 1298 (SC), it was held that
                                compensation for loss of consortium should be in
                                the range of Rs.5000 to Rs.10000/-. In legal
                                parlance, `consortium' is the right of the spouse to
                                the company, care, help, comfort, guidance,

             FAO No. 3819 of 2012                                            (5)
                           damages has not been properly understood by our
                           courts. The loss of companionship, love, care and
                           protection, etc., which the spouse is entitled to get,
                           has to be compensated appropriately.              The
                           concept of non-pecuniary damage for loss of
                           consortium is one of the major heads of award of
                           compensation in other parts of the world, more
                           particularly in the United States of America,
                           Australia, etc.        English courts have also
                           recognized the right of a spouse to get
                           compensation even during the period of temporary
                           disablement. By loss of consortium, the courts
                           have made an attempt to compensate the loss of
                           spouse's        affection,     comfort,       solace,
                           companionship, society, assistance, protection,
                           care and sexual relations during the future years.
                           Unlike the compensation awarded in other
                           countries and other jurisdictions, since the legal
                           heirs are otherwise adequately compensated for
                           the pecuniary loss, it would not be proper to award
                           a major amount under this head. Hence, we are of
                           the view that it would be only be just and
                           reasonable that the courts award at least
                           Rs.1,00,000/- towards loss of consortium."
</p><p id="p_12">            8.                  Since the deceased was 35/36 years old and
            keeping in view the concept of consortium referred to above, the
            amount for loss of consortium is enhanced to Rs.1 lac.
</p><p id="p_13">            9.                  In view of above, the Award of the Tribunal is
            modified to the extent that the appellants are held entitled to total
            compensation of Rs.8,30,000/-. The interest on the enhanced
            amount of Rs.2,39,000/- shall be paid from the date of filing claim
            application till the amount was deposited by the insurance company
            under the impugned Award at the same rate of interest as was
            awarded by the Tribunal.
