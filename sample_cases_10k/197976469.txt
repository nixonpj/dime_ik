             The   petitioner   who   is   defendant   No.1   in   the   suit   for   specific

performance   is   aggrieved   by   the   order   passed   by   the   trial   Court   below

Exhibit-30 rejecting the application for permission to file written statement.   



</blockquote><p id="p_3">2.           The   defendant   No.1   was   served   with   the   suit   summons   on

06/09/2015 and he appeared before the trial Court initially on 05/10/2015.

He sought time to file his written statement which came to be granted on

07/11/2015 and 26/11/2015.  His subsequent application however came to

be   rejected   on   09/12/2015   and   the   case   was   adjourned   for   passing   no

written   statement   order.       On   the   next   date   the   defendant   No.1   filed

application   under   provisions   of   Order   VII   Rule   11   of   the   Code   of   Civil

Procedure, 1908 seeking rejection of the plaint.   The copy of agreement on

which the suit  was based was not supplied to the defendant No.1 and hence

the plaintiff sought permission on 28/06/2016 to file the said document on

record.   The application at Exhibit-22 seeking rejection of the plaint moved

by the defendant No.1 was rejected on 28/07/2016 and the plaintiff was

directed to supply copy of the said document to the defendant No.1.   The

plaintiff undertook to supply that copy on the next date.   On 18/10/2016

time   was   again   granted   to   the   defendant   to   file   his   written   statement.

Thereafter   the   plaintiff   moved   the   Court   for   amending   the   plaint.     On

08/06/2017 the defendant No.1 again sought permission to file his written

statement.   By the impugned order the same was rejected on 23/06/2017.

</p><p id="p_5">3.           It   is   submitted   by   the   learned   counsel   for   the   petitioner   that

though time was initially sought for filing the written statement and it was

also   granted,   the   application   for   rejection   of   the   plaint   was   filed   on

14/01/2016.   This application was decided on 28/07/2016 after which the

plaintiff was required to supply copy of the agreement on which the suit was

based to the defendant No.1.  In the meanwhile the plaint was also amended

and therefore the written statement could not be filed earlier.    It is further

contended that as the office of the plaintiff's counsel had shifted, the written

statement   could   not   be   filed   within   time.     It   is   therefore   prayed   that

permission be granted to file the written statement  so as to contest the suit

on   merits.     Reliance   is   placed   on   the   decisions   in  Methodist   Episcopal

Church, Nagpur and ors. vs. Methodist Church in India, Mumbai and ors.

opposed aforesaid submissions.   It was submitted that period of more than

ninety days had passed but no written statement was filed.    The application

at Exhibit-21 was rejected on 09/12/2015 and therefore the right to file the

written statement was lost.  The amendment of the plaint related to the other

defendants and not the defendant No.1.  Hence the defendant No.1 ought to

have   filed   written   statement   within   the   time   prescribed   by   provisions   of

<p id="p_10">             The roznama indicates that after the suit summons was served,

the defendant No.1 sought time to file written statement and on 14/01/2016

the application at Exhibit-22 seeking permission to file the written statement

was rejected.   On the next date the defendant No.1 applied for the rejection

of the plaint which application was pending till 28/07/2016 on which date it

was so rejected.  On the same day the plaintiff undertook to supply copy of

the agreement in  question  on  which the  suit was based to the  defendant

No.1.       Thereafter   the   case   was   pending   for   considering   the   amendment

application   moved   by   the   plaintiff.     Ultimately   on   08/02/2017   the

application in question came to be filed.

</p><p id="p_12">6.           As held by this Court in  Methodist Episcopal Church, Nagpur

and ors.  (supra), once an interim application seeking rejection of plaint is

pending  that can be taken into consideration as a ground for condoning the

period for filing the written statement.   The application at Exhibit-22 was

pending till 28/07/2016.  Thereafter the copy of the agreement on which the

suit was based was sought from the plaintiff.  The defence could have been

raised after pursuing the said agreement.    Considering the fact that even on

18/10/2016   the   trial   Court   vide   Exhibit-27   granted   time   to   file   written

statement, an opportunity to file the same on record  deserves to be granted.

This would facilitate contest of the case on merits.   At the same time the

plaintiff deserves to be compensated for the delay caused in filing the written

statement.

</p><p id="p_14">7.               Accordingly the order passed below Exhibit-30 on 23/06/2017 is

set aside.    Application  at Exhibit-30 is allowed subject to defendant  No.1

paying costs of Rs.5000/- to the plaintiff before the trial Court.  If such costs

are paid within period of four weeks from today, the written statement of

defendant No.1 shall be accepted on record.
