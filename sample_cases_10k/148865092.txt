</p><p id="p_6">2.       Brief facts of the case are as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_7">         On 1.1.2004 the Constitution 91st Amendment Bill,

2003 was passed by both the Houses of Parliament. This Bill

after the assent of the President became an Act with

modifications              made         to      Articles         75      and        164        of     the

Constitution.               <a href="/doc/269107/" id="a_2">This Act</a> inter-alia provides under <a href="/doc/578636/" id="a_3">Article

164(1A)1</a> that the size of the Council of Ministers in the State

should not exceed 15% of the total strength of the Assembly.

</p><p id="p_8">3.       At the time of the coming into force of the 91st

Constitutional Amendment Act, 2003, the strength of the

Council of Ministers in the State of Assam was at 36 out of a

total 126 members, amounting to 28.57% of the strength of

the Legislative Assembly. In view of the mandate contained

in <a href="/doc/578636/" id="a_4">Article 164(1A)</a> the strength of the Council of Ministers

was to be brought down to 19 to be consistent with the

ceiling of 15% imposed by <a href="/doc/578636/" id="a_5">Article 164(1A).</a>

Council of Ministers in any State at the commencement of the Constitution (Ninety-first Amendment)
Act, 2003 exceeds the said fifteen per cent or the number specified in the first proviso, as the case may
be, then the total number of Ministers in that State shall be brought in conformity with the provisions of
this clause within six months from such date as the President may by public notification appoint.

(Appointment,               Salaries,          Allowances              and       Miscellaneous

Provisions)           Ordinance,              2004        was        promulgated.                   On

29.12.2004 THE ACT was passed and published in the

Official Gazette of the State of Assam.                               We may briefly refer

to the crucial provisions of the Act;
</p>
<p id="p_15">         <a href="/doc/1941999/" id="a_7">Section 2(c)</a> of the Act defines Parliamentary Secretary

as follows:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">         “‘Parliamentary Secretary’ means a Member of the Assam
         Legislative Assembly appointed as the Parliamentary
         Secretary under this Act by the Chief Minister.”

</p><p id="p_17">         “The Chief Minister may, having regard to the circumstances
         and the need of the situation, at any time appoint such
         number of Parliamentary Secretaries and assign to each of
         them such duties and functions as he may deem fit and
         proper.”


         <a href="/doc/410991/" id="a_8">Section 4</a> declares that Parliamentary Secretary should

be of the rank and status of a Minister of State and exercise

such powers, discharge such functions and perform such

duties as may be assigned to him by the Chief Minister. 2

Parliamentary Secretary.3


</p><p id="p_19">5.      Writ Petition (PIL) No.30/2005 was filed on 13.04.2005

in the Hon’ble High Court of Gauhati challenging the

constitutional validity of THE ACT. On 24.01.2006, the High

Court of Gauhati adjourned the hearing of the said PIL in

light of similar matters involving the same questions of law

which had come up for hearing in this Court in SLP No.

22038 of 2005 (State of Himachal Pradesh v. Citizen Rights

Protection Forum).
</p>
<p id="p_20">6.      On 30.05.2005, Eight Parliamentary Secretaries were

appointed in exercise of the power under THE ACT and they

took oath of office, but were not assigned any ministry.

</p><p id="p_21">7.      On 21.08.2006, this Court has allowed the Transfer

Petition (C) No. 433 of 2006 filed by the Petitioners under

8.       The case of the petitioners is that:

         (i)      The legislature of State of Assam does not have

                  competence to enact THE ACT;

         (ii)     THE ACT is violative of the constitutional mandate

                  Ministers;
</p>
<p id="p_25">         (iii)    That THE ACT is intended to over-reach the

                  mandate of the <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_14">Constitution Amendment Act</a> and

                  hence a fraud upon constitution;
</p>
<p id="p_26">         (iv)     Responsible government is a basic feature of the

                  Constitution and THE ACT is violative of the basic

                  structure of the Constitution.
</p>
<p id="p_27">
</p><p id="p_28">9.       The Respondent’s case is that,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">5</span>
           <a href="/doc/578636/" id="a_15">Article 164.</a> (1) The Chief Minister shall be appointed by the Governor and the other Ministers

                under THE ACT are different from the functions of

                a Minister and therefore neither the principle of

                collective responsibility nor the mandate of the

                Constitution     under    the   Constitution    91st

<p id="p_35">
       iii.     The question of violation of ‘basic structure’ of the

                Constitution cannot arise in the context of a

                legislation.   The doctrine is confined only to the

                Constitutional amendments.

</p><p id="p_37">10.    The following issues arise out of the above rival

     II.    Whether the creation of the office of Parliamentary

            Secretary would amount to a violation of the

</pre><p id="p_40">            constitutionally prescribed upper limit of 15% on

            the total number of Council of Ministers?
</p>
<p id="p_41">     III.   Whether    the    concept    of    a    ‘Responsible

            Government’ envisaged under various provisions of

            the Constitution is in any way violated by the

            impugned         enactment        and       therefore

            unconstitutional as being violative of the basic

            structure of the Constitution.
</p>
<p id="p_42">
     IV.    Whether the theory of basic structure could be

            invoked at all to invalidate an enactment which is

            otherwise not inconsistent with the text of the

            Constitution.

In our opinion, if the answer to any one of the first two issues

is in favour of the petitioner, the other two issues need not be

</p><p id="p_47">11.      Elaborating the 1st submission, the Petitioners argued

that the Political Executive (both national and state level) is

the creation of the Constitution itself. Articles 74(1) 6, 75(1)7,

163(1)8 and 164(1)9 of the Constitution create the offices of

the Prime Minister, Chief Minister and other Ministers

respectively. The framers of the Constitution were aware of

the     different         offices        in vogue            (such        as Parliamentary

Secretaries, Deputy Ministers etc) in various parliamentary

democracies but chose to make provisions for only the office

of ‘Minister’.10 The word ‘shall’ in these articles indicates that

no other office of the political executive can be created by

legislation either of the Parliament or State legislature.

       even assuming that the expression "regulation and

       disputes arising therefrom and a provision for adjudicating
       them, the Act does not make the declaration required by

      Legislative Assembly. This Hon’ble Court has, on various
      occasions, held that the Legislative entries “should not be

      fullest meaning and the widest amplitude and be held to

      should be held to extend to all ancillary or subsidiary
      matters which can fairly and reasonably be said to be

         not enable the legislature to make a law relating to a
         matter which has no rational connection with the
         subject-matter of an entry. When the vires of enactment
         is challenged, the court primarily presumes the
         constitutionality of the statute by putting the most liberal
         construction upon the relevant legislative entry so that it
         may have the widest amplitude and the substance of the
         legislation will have to be looked into.        The court
         sometimes is duty-bound to guard against extending the
         meaning of the words beyond their reasonable
         connotation in anxiety to preserve the power of the
         legislature.

<p id="p_66">18.      The jurisprudential basis for the “rule of widest

task of expounding a constitution is crucially different from that of construing a statute. A statute
defines present rights and obligations. It is easily enacted and as easily repealed. A constitution, by
contrast, is drafted with an eye to the future. Its function is to provide a continuing framework for the
legitimate exercise of governmental power and, when joined by a Bill or a charter of rights, for the
unremitting protection of individual rights and liberties. Once enacted, its provisions cannot easily be
repealed or amended. It must, therefore, be capable of growth and development over time to meet new
social, political and historical realities often unimagined by its framers. The judiciary is the guardian of

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">17</span>
            A constitution, to contain an accurate detail of all the subdivisions of which its great powers
will admit, and of all the means by which they may be carried into execution, would partake of the
prolixity of a legal code, and could scarcely be embraced by the human mind. It would probably never
be understood by the public. Its nature, therefore, requires that only its great outlines should be marked,
its important objects designated, and the minor ingredients which compose those objects be deduced
from the nature of the objects themselves. That this idea was entertained by the framers of the American
constitution, is not only to be inferred from the nature of the instrument, but from the language. Why
else were some of the limitations, found in the ninth section of the 1 st article, introduced? It is also, in
some degree, warranted by their having omitted to use any restrictive term which might prevent its
receiving a fair and just interpretation. In considering this question, then, we must never forget, that it is
a constitution we are expounding.

<p id="p_74"><span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">18</span>
</p><p id="p_75">          Is it true, that this is the sense in which the word “necessary” is always used? Does it always
import an absolute physical necessity, so strong, that one thing, to which another may be termed
necessary, cannot exist without that other? We think it does not. If reference be had to its use, in the
common affairs of the world, or in approved authors, we find that it frequently imports no more than that
one thing is convenient, or useful, or essential to another. To employ the means necessary to an end, is
generally understood as employing any means calculated to produce the end, and not as being confined
to those single means, without which the end would be entirely unattainable. Such is the character of
human language, that no word conveys to the mind, in all situations, one single definite idea; and nothing
is more common than to use words in a figurative sense. Almost all compositions contain words, which,
taken in their rigorous sense, would convey a meaning different from that which is obviously intended.
It is essential to just construction, that many words which import something excessive, should be
understood in a more mitigated sense – in that sense which common usage justifies. The word
“necessary” is of this description. It has not a fixed character peculiar to itself. It admits of all degrees
of comparison; and is often connected with other words, which increase or diminish the impression the
mind receives of the urgency it imports. A thing may be necessary, very necessary, absolutely or
indispensably necessary. To no mind would the same idea be conveyed, by these several phrases.

in all the jurisdictions where a written Constitution exists.

The US Supreme Court also recognised that the Congress

would have the authority to legislate with reference to certain

matters because of the fact that such authority is inherent in

      In substance, the power to make the legislation flows

from various sources: (1) express text of the Constitution; (2)

<p id="p_94">27.      The task of this Court in identifying the scope of an

entry in the Lists contained in the Seventh Schedule is not

easy.        While examining the scope of the entries this Court

must         necessarily             keep        in      mind         the       scheme            of     the

Constitution relevant in the context of the Entry in question.


</p><p id="p_95">28.      A broad pattern can be identified from the scheme of

the three lists, the salient features of which are (i) Fields of

legislation           unlike         the       US       Constitution,              (iii)    Residuary

nothing but another instance of special arrangement akin to

Parliament would be competent to legislate with reference to

the fields of legislation contained in Entries 23 and 24

whenever Parliament declared that it would be “expedient in

public interest” to legislate upon those topics would have

achieved the purpose. We may not be understood as sitting

in judgment over the wisdom of framers of the Constitution.

We are only pointing out the possibility of achieving results

sought to be achieved by Entries 52 and 54 by adopting

another model of drafting. Such a model is already resorted

to by the framers of the Constitution in making provisions of

Articles 249 and 250 etc.

     Our endeavour is only to demonstrate that a great deal

of examination of the scheme of the entire Constitution is

essential while interpreting the scope of each of the Entries

contained in the three Lists of the Seventh Schedule and no

rule which has a universal application with regard to the

interpretation of all entries in the 7th Schedule can be

postulated.   The statement of Chief Justice Gwyer that a

broad and liberal spirit should inspire those whose duty is to

interpret the Constitution and the legislative entries should

not be read in a narrow or pedantic sense, cannot be

understood as a sutra valid for all times and in all

circumstances. We have already noticed that this court on

more than one occasion cautioned about the perils of placing

a construction on the expressions contained in the various

Entries in the three Lists of Seventh Schedule as taking

within their sweep, matters that have no rational connection

with the subject matter of the Entry. The caution sounded

by Justice Venkatachaliah in Shah Goverdhan L. Kabra

the sources of power to legislate and stipulate the

areas with respect to which “the Congress” shall have

the “legislative power” but not in the context of

something like an entry in the 7th Schedule of our

Constitution which is not a source of power but only

indicative of the field of legislation. Though words

and expressions employed in the Constitution must

receive widest possible construction, we believe that

the principle must be applied with some degree of

caution when it comes to the examination of the

amplitude of the legislative Entries. There must be

some     distinction      between      a    provision     of       the

construction which would run counter to the scheme

of the Constitution relevant in the context must be

of a dedicated article in the Constitution authorizing the

the possibility of the existence of the legislative authority to

Schedule indicating a field of legislation which appears to be

closely associated with the topic dealt with by the dedicated

article.   For example even if the Constitution were not to

contain Entries 38, 39, 40 in List II the State Legislatures

would still be competent to make laws w.r.t. the topics

indicated in those 3 entries, because of the authority

contained in Articles 164(5), 186, 194, 195 etc. Therefore, to

                                                          30    3
of Tamil Nadu, by an order dated 25 th June 1991, the

tribunal gave certain directions35 to the State of Karnataka.

Thereupon, the State of Karnataka issued an ordinance

nullifying the directions of the tribunal referred to above.

The President of India by a reference under <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_70">Article 143 36</a> of

the Constitution sought the opinion of this Court regarding

the constitutionality of the ordinance.
</p>
<p id="p_135">
</p><p id="p_136">36.      The State of Karnataka argued that the ordinance in

question fell exclusively within the field of legislation

assigned to the States by <a href="/doc/77052/" id="a_71">Article 246 (3)</a> read with Entry 17 of

List II. In the absence of any law made by the Parliament

dealing with the subject matter of the content of the

ordinance in question, the authority of the legislature of

Karnataka remained unencumbered.

examine – whether the <a href="/doc/309835/" id="a_74">Inter State Water Disputes Act</a>, 1956

made by the Parliament was a law made in exercise of the

authority of the Parliament under <a href="/doc/671198/" id="a_75">Article 246(1) 37</a> read with

Entry 5638 of List I of the Seventh Schedule?                                 This Court

reached a conclusion that the <a href="/doc/309835/" id="a_76">Inter State Water Disputes Act</a>,

1956 is not a legislation referable to Entry 56 of List I. It also

took note of the fact that none of the Entries in Seventh

Schedule mentioned the topic of adjudication of disputes

relating to inter State waters and <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_77">Article 262 39</a> of the

Constitution specifically provides for such adjudication.

</p><p id="p_142">        “62. It cannot be disputed that the Act, viz., the
        <a href="/doc/309835/" id="a_78">Inter-State Water Disputes Act</a>, 1956 is not a legislation
        under Entry 56. In the first instance, Entry 56 speaks of
        regulation and development of inter-State rivers and river
        valleys and does not relate to the disputes between the
        riparian States with regard to the same and adjudication
        thereof. Secondly, and even assuming that the expression
        “regulation and development” would in its width, include
        resolution of disputes arising therefrom and a provision
        for adjudicating them, the Act does not make the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_37">37</span>
         <a href="/doc/77052/" id="a_79">Article 246.</a> (1) Notwithstanding anything in clauses (2) and (3), Parliament has
exclusive power to make laws with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List I in the
Seventh Schedule (in this Constitution referred to as the “Union List”).

</p><p id="p_143">         Entry 56. Regulation and development of inter-State rivers and river valleys to the
extent to which such regulation and development under the control of the Union is declared

          <a href="/doc/1558821/" id="a_80">Article 262.</a> (1) Parliament may by law provide for the adjudication of any dispute or
complaint with respect to the use, distribution or control of the waters of, or in, any
inter-State river or river valley. (2) Notwithstanding anything in this Constitution, Parliament
may by law provide that neither the Supreme Court nor any other court shall exercise
jurisdiction in respect of any such dispute or complaint as is referred to in clause (1).


</p><p id="p_144">                                                                                            32     3
      declaration required by Entry 56. This is obviously not
      an accidental omission but a deliberate disregard of the
      entry since it is not applicable to the subject matter of the
      legislation. Thirdly, no entry in any of the three lists
      refers specifically to the adjudication of disputes with
      regard to inter-State river waters.
</p>
<p id="p_145">      63. The reason why none of the Entries in the Seventh
      Schedule mention the topic of adjudication of disputes
      relating to the inter-State river waters is not far to seek.
      <a href="/doc/1558821/" id="a_81">Article 262</a> of the Constitution specifically provides for
      such adjudication. …”

</p><p id="p_146">      67. ... Since the subject of adjudication of the said
      disputes is taken care of specifically and exclusively by
      <a href="/doc/1558821/" id="a_82">Article 262</a>, by necessary implication the subject
      stands excluded from the field covered by Entries 56
      and 17. It is not, therefore, permissible either for the
      Parliament under Entry 56 or for a State legislature
      under Entry 17 to enact a legislation providing for
      adjudication of the said disputes or in any manner
      affecting or interfering with the adjudication or
      adjudicatory process of the machinery for adjudication
      established by law under <a href="/doc/1558821/" id="a_83">Article 262.</a> ...”


</p><p id="p_147">38.   The ordinance was found to be beyond the legislative

competence of the State of Karnataka.                 Because of the

existence of a dedicated article empowering the Parliament to

make laws for the adjudication of inter-State water disputes

the subject stood by implication excluded from the field

covered under Entries 56 or 17 and the ordinance in

substance had the effect of interfering with “adjudication

process of the machinery for adjudication established by law

under <a href="/doc/1558821/" id="a_84">Article 262</a>”.

</p><p id="p_150">39.     The distinction between the scheme of <a href="/doc/1558821/" id="a_85">Article 262</a> Entry

56 of List I and Entry 17 of List II and the scheme of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_86">Article

19440</a> and Entry 3941 of List II is this that in the case of

inter-State water disputes neither of the abovementioned two

Entries make any mention of the adjudication of water

disputes and only <a href="/doc/1558821/" id="a_87">Article 262</a> deals with the topic.                                    In the

case on hand, the relevant portion of the text of <a href="/doc/1130308/" id="a_88">Article 194(3)</a>

and Entry 39 of List are almost identical and speak about the

“powers, privileges and immunities” of the House, its

members and Committees.

</p><p id="p_160">40.   The question therefore is - whether the text of <a href="/doc/1130308/" id="a_90">Article

194(3)</a> and Entry 39 is wide enough to authorise the

legislature to make THE ACT?
</p>
<p id="p_161">
</p><p id="p_162">41.   In view of the fact that the text of both <a href="/doc/1130308/" id="a_91">Article 194(3)</a>

and the relevant portion of Entry 39 are substantially

similar, the meaning of the clause “ the powers, privileges and the

immunities of a House of the Legislature of a State …….. and of the

members of a House of such Legislature” must be examined.

</p><p id="p_163">42.   In ascertaining the meaning of the clause, the scheme

of <a href="/doc/74909/" id="a_92">Article 194</a> and the setting in which the said clause is

placed is relevant. <a href="/doc/74909/" id="a_93">Article 194</a> occurs in Chapter III of Part VI

of the Constitution which deals with the States. Chapter II of

Part VI deals with the State Executive. Chapter III deals with

the State Legislature. Various articles of Chapter III provide

for establishment of a legislature (either unicameral or

bicameral), the composition of such legislative bodies, the

qualifications for membership of the legislative bodies and

their durations, the offices of the legislature and their powers

and responsibilities and all other allied matters.




</p><p id="p_164">                                                                35    3
</p><p id="p_165">43.    <a href="/doc/74909/" id="a_94">Article 194</a> deals exclusively with the powers and

privileges of the legislature, its members and committees

thereof. While clause declares that there shall be freedom of

speech       in    the       Legislature       subject       to    the      limitations

enumerated therein, clause (2) provides immunity in favour

of the members of the Legislature from any legal proceedings

in any court for anything said or any vote given by such

members           in   the     Legislature        or     any      Committees          etc.

Sub-clause         (3)    deals      with     the      powers,       privileges       and

immunities of a House of the Legislature and its members

with respect to matters other than the ones covered under

clauses (1) and (2).

<p id="p_166">
</p><p id="p_167">44.    Thus, it can be seen from the scheme of <a href="/doc/74909/" id="a_95">Article 194</a> that

it does not expressly authorise the State Legislature to create

offices such as the one in question.                        On the other hand,

<a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_96">Article 17842</a> speaks about the offices of Speaker and Deputy

Speaker. <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_97">Article 17943</a> deals with the vacation of those offices

Chairman of the Legislative Council wherever the Council

exists.        In our opinion, the most crucial article in this

Chapter is <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_102">Article 18746</a> which makes stipulations even with

reference to the secretarial staff of the Legislature. On the

face      of     such        elaborate          and       explicit        constitutional

not see it necessary to examine the various other issues

allowed. The impugned Act is declared unconstitutional.
