maintenance to his wife and daughter. If at all, the first

defendant has failed to pay the maintenance as per the

orders in C.Misc.157/2013, the plaintiffs are having

every right to recover the same.

</p><p id="p_7">     14. As I have already stated supra, the suit property

was the absolute property of Shankaraiah and as such,

he had exercised his right and sold the suit property in

favour of the defendants No.7 &amp; 8. Neither the plaintiffs

nor the defendants 1 to 6 are having any right to claim

their alleged share in the suit property. It appears that

the first defendant himself had no right to claim the suit

property. So, the question of plaintiffs' alleged right does

not arise.   The sale deed executed by Shankaraiah in

favour of defendants No.7 &amp; 8 is nothing to do with the

plaintiffs and the remaining defendants.              The suit

property is not available for partition. It is not the joint

family property as contended by the plaintiffs.        Hence,

the plaintiffs are not entitled to the relief of partition.

Accordingly, I answer this point in the 'Negative'.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                              8              OS No.4648/2016</span>


petitioner.   It means, there is no order restraining the

defendants from alienating the suit property.

</p><p id="p_8">     13. PW. 1 has stated that the defendants 1 to 6

were colluded together and sold the suit property in

favour of defendants No.7 &amp; 8 by executing the registered

sale deed dated 1.8.2013.    Ex.P.1 is the certified copy of

sale deed dated 1.8.2013 executed by Shankaraiah in

favour of     the defendant No.7 &amp; 8.      This document

further discloses that the defendant No.1 to 6 are the

consenting witnesses.    It appears that the suit property

was the self acquired property of Shankaraiah, and as

such, he executed the sale deed.     There is a recital in

Ex.P.1 that Shankaraiah has sold the suit property to

clear the loan borrowed at Thyagaraja co-operative Bank

and also to meet the family necessities.         It means

Shankaraiah had sold the suit property for the benefit of

the family. It is relevant to note that in C.Misc.157/2013,

the court has ordered that the first respondent i.e., the

husband of the 2nd plaintiff is under an obligation to pay

</p><p id="p_9">     11. PW.1 has deposed that the defendants No.1 &amp; 2

and Shankaraiah were failed to comply the court order

and hence, she filed C.Misc.157/2013 for execution of

the order passed in C.Misc.641/2010. Ex.P.5 is the

certified copy of the order sheet in C.Misc.157/2013.

Ex.P.6   is    the   certified   copy    of   final    orders    in

C.Misc.157/2013. As per this document, the court has

directed the respondent No.1 to pay maintenance of

Rs.1,500/- p.m., to his daughter and Rs.1,000/- p.m., to

the petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_10">     12. PW.1 has deposed that the defendants 1 &amp; 2

and Shankaraiah have no right to alienate the suit

property.     It is worth to note that while passing orders in

C.Misc.641/2010,       the   court      has   stated    that    the

respondent No.1 (first defendant herein) is directed to

provide all basic necessities to his wife and children and

also directed the respondents not to dispossess the

petitioner    from   the   shared    household        and   further

directed to provide alternative accommodation to the

The defendants have not filed the written statement to

dispute the relationship.   So, it is established that the

plaintiffs are the daughter and wife of the first defendant.

</p><p id="p_11">     9. PW.1 has deposed that one Ankaiah was the

allottee of the suit property and allotment order was

issued on 2.10.1980.    The 2nd plaintiff has deposed that

after the death of Ankaiah, the sale deed dated 29.6.1992

was registered in favour of his son Shankaraiah.        The

plaintiffs have not produced the alleged allotment order

issued in favour of one Ankaiah. The plaintiffs have also

not produced the registered/certified copy of sale deed

dated 29.6.1992 executed in favour of Shankaraiah.

</p><p id="p_12">     10. PW.1 has deposed that she filed petition in

C.Misc.641/2010 against the defendants 1 &amp; 2 and

Shankaraiah under the provisions of Protection of

Women from <a href="/doc/542601/" id="a_1">Domestic Violence Act</a>.         She has further

stated that the said petition was allowed and the court

has directed to provide alternative accommodation.

</blockquote><p id="p_17"><a href="/doc/542601/" id="a_2">Domestic Violence Act</a>.      The said petition was allowed

and court has directed the defendants to provide

alternative accommodation and not to commit any

domestic violence.      Shankaraiah and defendants 1 to 6

were entered into an agreement on 21.9.2011 that they

want to demolish the structure, put up new house and

going to provide accommodation to the plaintiffs. The

defendants 1 &amp; 2 and Shankaraiah were failed to comply

the   court    order.     So,       2nd   plaintiff   has       filed

C.Misc.157/2013 for execution of the Order passed in

CMisc.641/2010.           The       defendants    1   &amp;     2   and

Shankaraiah have no right to alienate the suit property.

However, the defendants 1 to 6 and Shankaraiah sold

suit property in favour of defendant No.7 &amp; 8.                  The

plaintiffs are having legitimate share in the suit property.

Hence, the registered sale deed dated 1.8.2013 is not

binding on the plaintiffs. Hence, this suit.
