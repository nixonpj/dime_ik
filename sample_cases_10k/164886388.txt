<div class="doc_title">Ramesh Kumar vs Registrar Cooperative Societies ... on 22 August, 2017</div><pre id="pre_1"> IN THE HIGH COURT OF UTTARAKHAND AT NAINITAL

                    Writ Petition (S/B) No. 366 of 2017


Ramesh Kumar                                      ............       Petitioner

                                       Versus

Registrar, Cooperative Societies Uttarakhand and another
                                            ............. Respondents

Mr. B.P.S. Mer, Advocate for the petitioner.
Mr. N.S. Pundir, Advocate for respondent no. 2.


                                                   Dated: 22nd August, 2017

                       Coram: Hon'ble K.M. Joseph, C.J.
                              Hon'ble Alok Singh, J.
</pre>

<p id="p_1">K.M. JOSEPH, C.J. (Oral)

       Petitioner impugns order dated 11.08.2017 (Annexure

No.1) whereunder he stands transferred from Tehri to

Pithoragarh.
</p>
<p id="p_2">

</p><p id="p_3">2.     We heard Mr. B.P.S. Mer, learned counsel on behalf of the

petitioner and Mr. N.S. Pundir, learned counsel on behalf of the

second respondent, who has passed the impugned order. We

see no reason to hear the first respondent.



</p><p id="p_4">3.     Mr. B.P.S. Mer, learned counsel for the petitioner would

point out that the petitioner is due to retire on 30.11.2017. He

would further point out that by order dated 26.05.2016,

petitioner, who was working as a General Manager, was

transferred from Tehri to Dehradun. Still later, on 17.01.2017, he

was transferred from Dehradun to Tehri and it is, thereafter,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                 2</span>




within a period of nearly seven months that the petitioner is

transferred to Pithoragarh. He would point out that under

Regulation 38(c) of the Uttar Pradesh Cooperative Centralised

Service Rules, 1976, transfer of a member of the service shall

ordinarily not be made before five years of his service at one

place. He would further point out that the Policy, which is

adopted and is followed by the Bank, in relation to transfer,

stipulates that a person should not be transferred when he has

less than 2 years to retire. The home district of the petitioner is

Tehri and he has been transferred to Tehri by order dated

17.01.2017.
</p>
<p id="p_5">

</p><p id="p_6">4.    When, we asked Mr. N.S. Pundir, learned counsel for

respondent no. 2 to get instructions, he got instructions. He

would submit that actually, the reason for transfer of the

petitioner is that there is no one to man the post of General

Manager at Pithoragarh, and at Tehri, there are two General

Managers. Learned counsel for the petitioner Mr. B.P.S. Mer

would then point out that the petitioner is due to retire within

seven months and then anyone else has to be posted there.



</p><p id="p_7">5.    In this case, we find that there are no allegations of mala

fide. As far as Regulation 38(c) of the Uttar Pradesh

Cooperative Centralised Service Rules, 1976 is concerned, no

doubt, it provides that ordinarily a person is to be posted for a

period of five years.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                   3</span><p id="p_8">




</p><p id="p_9">6.      In the circumstances of the case, we would think that the

interest of justice would be sub-served if we permit the

petitioner to represent his grievance and a decision is taken on

the same.
</p>
<p id="p_10">

</p><p id="p_11">7.      Accordingly, the writ petition is disposed of as follows:

</p><p id="p_12">        If the petitioner represents before the second respondent

within a period of one day from today, a decision will be taken

on the same, in accordance with law and also taking note of the

Policy, within a period of one week from the date of receipt of

the representation.
</p>
<p id="p_13">        Till such time, the impugned order will be kept in

abeyance.
</p>
<p id="p_14">

</p><p id="p_15">8.      Let certified copy of this judgment be issued today itself.
