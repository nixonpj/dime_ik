<pre id="pre_1">          THE HON'BLE SRI JUSTICE T.SUNIL CHOWDARY

                     SECOND APPEAL No.331 of 2013

JUDGMENT:
</pre>
<p id="p_1">      This appeal is filed by the plaintiff, under section 100 CPC,

assailing the judgment and decree dated 30.11.2012 passed in

A.S.No.44 of 2004 on the file of VI Additional District Judge

Court(Fast Track), Krishna, Machilipatnam, wherein whereby the

decree and judgment dated 16.02.2004 passed in O.S.No.592 of

2001 on the file of I Additional Junior Civil Judge Court,

Machilipatnam, dismissing the suit filed by the plaintiff for

declaration     and         consequential    perpetual   injunction,    was

confirmed.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">2.    Heard the learned counsel for the appellant and perused the

record.
</p>
<p id="p_4">
</p><p id="p_5">3.    For the sake of convenience, the parties will be hereinafter

referred to as they were arrayed before the trial Court to avoid

confusion.
</p>
<p id="p_6">
</p><p id="p_7">4.    The facts leading to filing of the second appeal are briefly as

follows: It is the case of the plaintiff that he is the absolute owner

and possessor of an extent of Ac.0.13 cents of land situated in

R.S.No.320/9 and R.S.No.320/10 of Mallavolu village, Gudur

Mandal, hereinafter referred to as 'suit schedule property'.            The

defendant is also a pensioner and residing in Mallavolu village.

The plaintiff owns an extent of Ac.2.26 cents in R.S.No.115/1A,

Ac.0.79 cents in R.S.No.318/9, Ac.2.01 cents in R.S.No.321/1D,

Ac.0.11      cents     in     R.S.No.320/9     and   Ac.0.02    cents    in

r.S.No.320/10. The plaintiff purchased an extent of Ac.2.14 cents
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                     2</span>


on 31.07.1992 from one Bathina Visweswara Rao. Ever since, the

plaintiff has been in possession and enjoyment of the same. As per

the recitals of registered sale deed dated 31.07.1992, the plaintiff's

vendor by name Bathina Visweswara Rao is the owner of an extent

of Ac.2.14 cents. The plaintiff's vendor got the property under a

registered partition deed. The defendant without any rights what

so ever interfering with the suit schedule property.           Having no

other alternative, the plaintiff filed the suit for declaration and

consequential perpetual injunction in respect of the suit schedule

property.
</p>
<p id="p_8">
</p><p id="p_9">5.    The defendant filed written statement denying all the

averments made in the plaint including the sale deed dated

31.07.1992 inter alia contending that the defendant owned land in

R.S.No.320/1, R.S.No.320/02, R.S.No.320/3, R.S.No.320/4 and

R.S.No.320/6 and that the plaintiff is not in possession of suit

schedule property. The plaintiff got issued a notice to the surveyor

marking copy of the same to the defendant.                  The revenue

authorities measured and demarcated the land owned by the

defendant at his request. The plaintiff, who is a chronic litigant,

filed the present suit with an ulterior motive to grab the property of

the defendant. Hence, the suit is liable to be dismissed


</p><p id="p_10">6.    Basing on the above pleadings, the trial Court framed the

following issues:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">      1. Whether the plaintiff is entitled to a declaration that the
         plaintiff is the absolute owner of the ABCD property as
         sought for?
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">      2. Whether the plaintiff is entitled to the relief of permanent
         injunction as prayed for?
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">      3. To what relief?
</blockquote><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                   3</span>


<p id="p_11">7.    Before the trial Court, on behalf of the plaintiff, P.Ws.1 to 3

were examined and Exs.A1 to A7 were marked. On behalf of the

defendant, D.W.1 was examined and Exs.B1 to B13 were marked.


</p><p id="p_12">8.    Basing on the oral, documentary evidence and other material

available on record, the trial Court arrived at a conclusion that the

plaintiff failed to prove that he is the absolute owner of the suit

schedule property and dismissed the suit filed by the plaintiff for

declaration. Feeling aggrieved by the judgment and decree of the

trial Court dated 16.02.2004 in O.S.No.592 of 2001, the plaintiff

preferred A.S.No.44 of 2004 on the file of the VI Additional District

Court (Fast Track), Krishna at Machilipatnam. The first appellate

Court after reappraising the oral and documentary evidence

available on record, arrived at a conclusion that the plaintiff failed

to prove his title over the suit schedule property and dismissed the

appeal while confirming the findings recorded by the trial Court.

Hence, the unsuccessful plaintiff preferred the present second

appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_13">
</p><p id="p_14">9.    The question of law urged by the appellant is that the

plaintiff being the owner of an extent of Ac.0.11 cents in

R.S.No.320/9 and Ac.0.02 cents in R.S.No.320/10 is entitled for

the relief of declaration.
</p>
<p id="p_15">
</p><p id="p_16">10.   The oral and documentary evidence placed before the trial

Court clinchingly establishes that the plaintiff purchased an extent

of Ac.2.01 cents in R.S.No.321/1D, Ac.0.11 cents in R.S.No.320/9

and Ac.0.02 cents in R.S.No.320/10 under a registered sale deed

dated 31.07.1992, Ex.A1. It is the further case of the plaintiff that

his vendors got the suit schedule property under a registered
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                   4</span>


partition deed dated 19.10.1957, Ex.B1.        As per the recitals of

Exs.A2 to A7, the plaintiff owned an extent of Ac.0.11 cents in

R.S.No.320/9 and Ac.0.02 cents in R.S.No.320/10. P.W.2, who is

the Village Revenue Officers, is one of the attestors of Ex.A1 sale

deed. The case of the plaintiff is that his vendors left an extent of

Ac.0.14 cents in R.S.No.320/9 and Ac.0.02 cents in R.S.No.320/10

for the purpose of passage. It is the further case of the plaintiff

that after partition in the year 1957, the vendors of the plaintiff

occupied Ac.0.11 cents of land in R.S.No.320/9 and Ac.0.02 cents

in R.S.No.320/10, which was left for the purpose of passage. As

seen from the testimony of P.W.2, they have demarcated the land

in different survey numbers. The trial Court made an observation

that there are some corrections in Ex.A2 pattadar pass books.

Suffice it to say that in a suit for declaration, the plaintiff has to

establish his case by preponderance of probabilities.       It is also

settled principle of law that the plaintiff may succeed or fail basing

on the strength or weaknesses of his case. It is needless to say

that the plaintiff is not entitled for the relief of declaration basing

on the latches or lacunas, if any, on the part of the defendant.


</p><p id="p_17">11.   Let me consider the facts of the case on hand in the light of

the above legal principle.
</p>
<p id="p_18">
</p><p id="p_19">12.   The trial Court as well as the appellate Court gave a specific

finding that the plaintiff purchased an extent of Ac.2.14 cents in

R.S.No.320/1, 320/9 and 320/10.         If the recitals of Ex.B1 are

taken into consideration, the vendors of the plaintiff got an extent

of Ac.2.01 cents in R.S.No.321/1 only.          There is a variation

between the recitals of Ex.B1 settlement deed and Ex.A1 sale deed.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                    5</span>


A duty is casts on the plaintiff to clarify the reasons for variation

between Ex.B1 and Ex.A1. There is no whisper in the testimony of

P.W.2 that the vendors of the plaintiff left an extent of Ac.0.11

cents in R.S.No.320/9 and Ac.0.02 cents in R.S.No.320/10 for the

purpose of passage. The plaintiff has to establish that when his

vendor occupied Ac.0.11 cents of land in R.S.No.320/9 and

Ac.0.02 cents in R.S.No.320/10. When compared to P.Ws.1 and 2,

the vendors of the plaintiff are the competent persons to speak

about the facts pleaded by the plaintiff.      Mere assertion in the

plaint itself would not amount to proof of the same. In order to

succeed the suit, the plaintiff has to establish by preponderances

of probabilities that his vendors occupied Ac.0.11 cents of land in

R.S.No.320/9 and Ac.0.02 cents in R.S.No.320/10, which is being

used for the purpose of passage, after 1957 and before 1992. The

evidence produced by the plaintiff falls short to establish the above

said fact. Without establishing the above said fact, the plaintiff is

not entitled for the relief of declaration.      Both Courts gave a

specific finding that the plaintiff failed to establish that his vendors

had taken back an extent of Ac.0.11 cents in R.S.No.320/9 and

Ac.0.02 cents in R.S.No.320/10. For one reason or the other, the

plaintiff did not choose to examine his vendor to establish the

above referred fact. This Court shall not lightly interfere with the

concurrent finding of fact recorded by the Courts below unless

there is an error apparent on the face of the record. This Court

can interfere with the findings recorded by the Courts below, if the

same are perverse.
</p>
<p id="p_20">
</p><p id="p_21">13.   The findings recorded by the Courts below can be termed as

perverse, if the same are not based on evidence or based on
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                    6</span>


evidence, which is not legally admissible. As rightly pointed out by

the learned counsel for the appellant, this Court can set aside the

perverse findings. The Courts below have considered the recitals of

Ex.A.1 sale deed and Ex.B.1 partition deed, in the light of the oral

evidence adduced by both parties. The findings recorded by the

Courts below are based on evidence much less legally admissible

evidence, therefore, I am unable to accede to the contention of the

learned counsel for the appellant that the findings recorded by the

Courts below are perverse.      In the absence of proving of above

referred facts, the plaintiff is not entitled for the relief of

declaration.
</p>
<p id="p_22">
</p><p id="p_23">14.    Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the plaintiff

proved his possession over the suit schedule property to an extent

of Ac.0.14 cents basing on Ex.A1 sale deed, Exs.A2 and A3 revenue

records, therefore, the plaintiff is entitled for perpetual injunction

and that particular aspect was not considered by the courts below

in right direction. It is needless to say the Court cannot grant the

relief of declaration basing on the entries made in the revenue

record. In the instant case, the relief of declaration is the main

relief and the relief of perpetual injunction is only a consequential

one.    A party to the proceedings is not entitled for the

consequential relief without proving the main relief sought for. In

the present case, the plaintiff is not entitled for consequential relief

of injunction in respect of the suit schedule property without

establishing his title over the suit schedule property. The Courts

below are right in rejecting the relief of perpetual injunction in

favour of the plaintiff, therefore, I am unable to accede the

contention of the learned counsel for the appellant that the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                     7</span>


plaintiff is entitled for perpetual injunction, even though he failed

to prove his title over the suit schedule property. I am fully

endorsing with the findings recorded by the Courts below.


</p><p id="p_24">15.   Having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case, I

am of the considered view that there is no question of law much

less substantial question of law involved in this appeal, hence, the

appeal is liable to be dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_25">
</p><p id="p_26">16.   In the result, the Second Appeal is dismissed at the

admission stage. There shall be no order as to costs.


</p><p id="p_27">17.   Consequently, Miscellaneous Petitions, if any, pending in

both the Second Appeals shall stand closed.
