           BIFR, ultimately vide order dated 21.01.2004, Company was declared

           SICK. Since collaboration agreement contained arbitration clause, the

           Arbitrator entered into reference in 2004. As per order dated 20.02.2009

           passed by the BIFR, the share capital of the company was reduced by 90%

           and, therefore, in lieu of the provision of <a href="/doc/648614/" id="a_3">Section 56</a> of the Contract Act, it

           was impossible to honour collaboration agreement i.e. buy back share after

           five years of commercial production. The Arbitrator did not take into

           consideration the aforementioned fact, much less, the Objecting Court also

           dismissed the objections by holding that objections were not falling within

           the realm of <a href="/doc/1219022/" id="a_4">Section 34</a> of the Act. The Arbitration Tribunal only considered

           <a href="/doc/1691689/" id="a_5">Section 22</a> of the SICA (Sick Industrial Companies Act, 1985) Act and did

           not refer to the aforementioned clauses.

           agreement are sacrosanct and even adopted by invoking the provision of

<p id="p_8">                                On perusal of the aforementioned provisions, it is evident that

           act which occurred afterwards envisages the performance of the contract

           impossible. Since, the factum of the reduction in the share capital, as per the

           order dated 20.02.2009 which is the part of the record of the Arbitrator is a

           matter of record, the Arbitrator, in my view, has not taken into consideration

           the aforementioned facts, much less, provision of the Act and thus there is

           total disregard to the statutory provision. This Court cannot remain

           oblivious of the fact that with the alleged buying of the shares of the

           company on behalf of PSIDC, the company could not run. The company had

           on his own invested huge investment and owing to reduction, huge loss has

           accumulated, therefore, company did not indulge into forcible reduction in

           the capital. It was on account of unforseen circumstances which may be on

           account of stake market or for some other reasons. In my view, the award of

           the Arbitrator is against public policy as the provision of <a href="/doc/1219022/" id="a_8">Section 34</a> has not
