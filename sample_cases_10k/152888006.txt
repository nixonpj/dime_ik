                  consistent and concurrent findings of fact against the petitioner, there is

                  no substantial ground to assail the conviction of the petitioner for offence

                  charged against him. Counsel, however, would submit that keeping in

                  view the extent and nature of recovery effected from the petitioner and the

                  period during which he suffered pangs of criminal proceedings, the

                  substantive sentence awarded to the petitioner for a period of six months

                  may be reduced to the period already undergone as he suffered actual

                  custody for a period of about two and a half month mentioned in order

                  dated May 29, 2006 when his sentence was ordered to be suspended and

                  he was released on bail.

<p id="p_3">                               Counsel for the State has not disputed the facts on record.

                               I have heard Counsel for the parties and perused the records.

                               The criminal proceedings were initiated against the petitioner

                  with the lodging of FIR No.120 dated 28.03.2002 in Police Station

                  Kotwali Bathinda for offence under <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_1">Section 61</a> of the Excise Act. The

                  petitioner suffered trauma of criminal proceedings for a period of 12

                  years. There is nothing on record to suggest that delay in conclusion of

                  proceedings is attributable to the petitioner. On an earlier occasion, the

                  petitioner was convicted for commission of offence punishable under the

                  Punjab Excise Act and was released by giving benefit of probation.

                  Under these circumstances, the provisions of <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_2">section 68-A</a> of the Act has

                  no applicability for awarding sentence to the petitioner.

                  for a period of 12 years, the substantive sentence awarded to the
