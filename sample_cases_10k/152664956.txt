       has sought direction against the respondent No.
       1 to decide the Dispute Application No. 5 of
       2017 filed by the petitioner forthwith, and has
       also    challenged      the      notice   dated   06.09.2018
       issued by the Collector, Gir Somnath.                     In the
       alternative, the petitioner has also prayed to
       postpone the proceedings in connection with the
       notice dated 06.09.2018 issued by the Collector,
       until the Dispute Application No. 5 of 2017 is
       decided by the respondent No. 1.
</p>

<p id="p_2">  2.          After having heard learned advocates for the
       parties, it appears that by the impugned notice


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                Page 1 of 3</span>
       C/SCA/14324/2018                                                    ORDER




     dated 06.09.2018, the Collector has convened the
     general meeting of the Talala Nagar Palika on
     18.09.2018           i.e.        today         for        the    purpose           of
     election of President and Vice President of the
     said Nagar Palika.                 It is sought to be submitted
     by the learned advocate Mr. Dipen Desai for the
     petitioner          that      the         petitioner            has       already
     initiated            the         proceedings               being          Dispute

     Nos. 4 and 5 under the Gujarat Provision for
     Disqualification of Members of Local Authorities

     the said Dispute Application No. 5 of 2017 is
     decided by the respondent No. 1, the proceedings
     of    election        of     President              and    Vice       President
     should be postponed.                     Of course, after arguing
     the    matter        for    sometime,           Mr.        Desai      submitted
     that     his        purpose         would           be     served         if      the
     proceedings are permitted to go on, however, the
     minutes of the meeting are recorded noting as to
     who voted in favour of whom, as the voting is to
     be done by raising hands.

<p id="p_3">3.          In view of the above, without expressing any
     opinion      on      the     merits            of    the        case,        it    is
     directed       that        the      general          meeting         of      Talala
     Nagarpalika be held as scheduled pursuant to the
     notice dated 06.09.2018, however, the result of
     the election of President and Vice President of
     the    said Nagarpalika                 shall be           subject to             the
