                   CRA-80-2013
                        (VEERAM SINGH BHEEL Vs STATE)

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">5</span>
Gwalior, Dated : 26-06-2018
      Shri Veeram Singh Bheel present in person.
      SHO Police Station Raghogarh District Guna has sent a report, in
which it is mentioned that warrants could not be served on the appellant
Veeram Singh Bheel S/o Amar Singh Bheel because it was informed that
he had gone to Rajasthan in search of work.
</p><p id="p_2">      Shri Veeram Singh Bheel submits that he was at his home at
Goklaya as he was not keeping good health and he was working at
Namnagar which is only 6 km. away from his place of residence in
village Goklaya.
</p><p id="p_3">      Thus, it is apparent that SHO has given a forged and concocted
report in regard to non service of warrants on the warrantee Veeram
Singh Bheel S/o Amar Singh Bheel.
</p><p id="p_4">      In view of such facts, S.P. Guna is directed to take action against
SHO Raghogarh, District Guna for furnishing false, fabricated and
concocted report in regard to service of bailable warrants on the
warrantee.
</p><p id="p_5">      It is seen that there is growing tactics of the police officers of not
complying with the order of the court and giving such false reports.
Action be also taken against the Panch namely Rambabu S/o Ramsingh
and Shrilal S/o Ramprasad who have given false Panchnama, inasmuch
as warrantee appellant Veeram Singh Bheel submits that for the last 5-6
days he was at home at village Goklaya. Such tendency to play with the
process of the court is dangerous and deceitful for administration of
justice and any police officer causing such hindrance in administration
of justice should not be let off lightly. S.P. Guna shall furnish a detailed
inquiry report and action taken report against SHO Police Station
Raghogarh and the Panch namely Rambabu S/o Ramsingh and Shrilal S/o
Ramprasad, who have given false Panchnam dt.24.6.2018, whereas
according to the warrantee he was already available in his village and
nobody approached him from police station. He has been informed by his
counsel Shri Rishikesh Bohare about today's date and therefore he has
come to the court today.
</p><p id="p_6">       Heard on I.A.No.4734/2018.
</p><p id="p_7">                                     2                         CRA-80-2013
      For the reasons mentioned in the application, same is allowed and
the absence of the appellant for 16.5.2018 is condoned. Now he is
directed to appear before the CJM Guna on 14.11.2018 and on all such
other dates as may be fixed by the concerned CJM.
</p><p id="p_8">      Heard on I.A.No.4738/2018.
</p><p id="p_9">      As the appellant has already appeared, this I.A. is allowed and the
warrants are recalled.
</p><p id="p_10">      However, it is made clear that S.P.Guna shall furnish report in
regard to action taken against SHO Police Station Raghogarh District
Guna and the concerned police officer responsible for service of
warrants of the appellant and furnish the report within thirty days on his
own affidavit.
</p><p id="p_11">      List on 30.07.2018.
</p>
