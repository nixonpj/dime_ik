</p><p id="p_2">1.      Since facts of both the cases are common, for the sake of convenience
        the facts mentioned in the application filed in W.P.(C).3791/2015 are
        being noticed for the disposal of these applications.
</p><p id="p_3">2.      By the present applications, the applicants/DDA seeks vacation of the
        interim orders granted by this Court on 20.04.2015. Post filing of
        these applications in the year 2016, the DDA has also filed an
        additional affidavit with an application. The grounds urged before this
        Court for vacating the interim orders granted are that the DDA
        convened a meeting under the Chairmanship of the Lt. Governor of
        Delhi in which it was decided to explore/identify approximately 10
        acres of land for cluster bus depot at Rohini area for allotment of the
        same to the Transport Department of the Government of NCT of
        Delhi. Subsequently, on 14.11.2014 with a view to implement the
        decision of the Lt. Governor, a joint inspection was carried out. A site
        measuring approximately 10 acres in Pocket-11 in public and semi
        public area, Sector-32, Rohini, Phase-IV, adjacent 80 meter wide
        road(UER-III) was identified. On the basis of a joint inspection,
        Additional Commissioner/Secretary(STA), Transport Department,
        Government of NCT of Delhi had confirmed that the site measuring
        4.0 hectare in Pocket-11, Block-C, PSP area, Sector-32, Rohini,
        Phase-IV was found suitable for the Transport Department and the
        same was conveyed to the DDA on 18.01.2014. Upon receiving the
        consent from the Transport Department on 18.11.2014, the DDA

         approved the aforesaid sites and accordingly an advance copy of the
        lay-out plan of Sector-32, Phase-IV, Rohini for the proposed bus depot
        of the land earmarked with the aforesaid proposed sites was released
        to Land Disposal Wing of the DDA and Engineering Wing, DDA for
        further action. The DDA started inviting objections/suggestions with
        respect to approval for issue of public notice which was
        issued/published in Gazette of India, Part-II, Sector-3, Sub-Section (ii)
        on 31.07.2015 in four newspapers. It is submitted that at that stage,
        the DDA learnt about the orders dated 20.04.2015 passed by this
        Court. Reliance is also placed on the fact that the Supreme Court was
        seized of the W.P.(C).13029/1985 titled <a href="/doc/69408974/" id="a_1">M.C. Mehta v. Union of
        India</a> regarding air pollution and improvement of public transport in
        Delhi. An order has been passed to ensure delivery of land to State
        Government. The DDA thereafter, has filed an additional affidavit
        adding additional grounds for vacation of stay. Paras 3 and 4 of the
        additional affidavit read as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">             "3.       It is submitted that the land in question falls in Sector
             31 and 32, Rohini. Presently in these sectors, peripheral sewer
             lines and road work is in progress. In North side of this Sector
             60 m r/w road constructed during 2009-10 is already existing
             and fully functional and traffic is plying through this road.
             The work of providing and laying peripheral sewer lines in
             these sectors is held up due to the status quo with regard to the
             nature, title and possession of the subject land falling in the
             alignment of the sewer line in the service land of this 60 m
             R/w road towards Sector 32, Rohini, New Delhi. The khasra
             plan/plan of Sector 32 indicating location where the work of
             laying of sewer line through service lane is held up due to
             status quo (approximate 90.00 Meters length of sewer line) are
             annexed as ANNEXURE-1(Colly). All the peripheral lines

              have been laid in this sector except this portion bearing Khasra
             Nos.10//10/3 and 10//11/1 of Village Pansali, which is under
             status quo. This area is required to be developed on priority
             basis because some of the plots in Sector 32, Rohini are to be
             allotted to the registrants of the Rohini Residential Scheme
             1981 and are under monitoring with the Hon'ble Supreme
             Court, details of which are mentioned in the C.M.
             No.16426/2016 and the same are not reproduced herein for the
             sake of brevity.

<blockquote id="blockquote_2">             4.       The abovementioned work of the drain is part of the
             essential services to be provided by the answering
             respondent/applicant herein in the Rohini Residential Scheme.
             In the event, the work of the sewer drain is not completed
             before the monsoon, there could be flooding in the areas of
             Sector 34-37 of Rohini, Delhi."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_4">3.      Ms. Esha Mazumdar, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the
        petitioners/non-applicants submits that sufficient grounds are not
        available for the interim orders to be vacated. The applications were
        filed in the year 2016 and not pressed till 2018. The grounds taken in
        the initial applications pertain to the construction of a proposed bus
        depot. However, in the additional affidavit filed by the DDA it is
        stated that a drain is to be constructed. She further submits that the
        land was acquired while relying on <a href="/doc/1797812/" id="a_2">Section 17</a> of the Land Acquisition
        Act, 1894 (urgency clause). She submits that no right of hearing was
        granted to the petitioners under <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_3">Section 5A</a> of the Land Acquisition
        Act, whereas in fact there was no urgency in the matter and the
        petitioners could not have been deprived of their statutory and
        constitutional right of hearing under <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_4">Section 5A</a>, which has been duly
        recognized by various judgments of the Supreme Court of India.
</p>



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">W.P. (C) Nos.3791/2015 &amp; 3822/2015                                    Page 4 of 6</span>
<p id="p_5"> 4.      However, after some hearing in the applications, Ms. Mazumdar
        submits that if the land of the petitioners is coming in the way of
        development for a public purpose, the petitioners would not come in
        their way. However, she submits that all grounds raised by her in the
        writ petitions pertaining to possession should be kept open.             She
        contends that physical possession of the said land continues to remain
        with the petitioners, which is evident from the fact that the DDA could
        not carry out their work as the possession was with the petitioners.
        She submits that the stand of the DDA that the possession was taken
        would not hold any ground as the respondents did not follow the
        settled law, no witnesses were available at the time when the
        possession was taken. She submits that she would rely on all other
        grounds as raised in the writ petitions at the time of final hearing.
</p><p id="p_6">5.      We have heard the learned counsels for the parties.              We have
        examined the site plan, which has been handed over in Court by
        Mr.Arjun Pant, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the DDA,
        which shows that 90% of the work pertaining to drain stands
        completed barring some portion where work could not be carried out
        on account of the status quo order. We are rather surprised as to why
        this fact was not brought to the notice of this Court when the interim
        orders were granted.
</p><p id="p_7">6.      Leaving all the contentions of the parties open, the interim orders
        dated 20.04.2015 are vacated. We make it clear that all the grounds
        raised by the petitioners in the writ petitions, including the grounds
        that the petitioners are in possession of the land and that the
        possession was not taken in accordance with law are kept open.
