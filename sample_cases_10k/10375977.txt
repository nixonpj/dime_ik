                      of Forests and made her to give false complaint against the

                      complaint an enquiry was conducted and it was found that the

                      complaint was false and the same was closed in the year 2004.

                      Rules, 1973.    Subsequently, Rule 17 (a) charge was converted

                      into Rule 17 (b) charge.    The petitioner submitted his detailed

                      explanation and oral enquiry was also conducted. Thereafter, the

                      Proceedings has rendered a finding by holding three charges

                      against     the   petitioner.   On     20.12.2016,   the    Tribunal   for

                      cause notice dated 20.12.2016, it would be suffice to issue

                      direction to the 1st respondent to allow the petitioner to

                      participate in the Disciplinary Proceedings and to consider and
