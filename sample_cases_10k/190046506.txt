<p id="p_1">                 CORAM: HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE T.P.S. MANN

                 Present :      Mr. Rakesh Kumar, Advocate

                                Mr. R.S.Randhawa, Addl. A.G., Punjab

                 T.P.S. MANN, J.(Oral)

                                Prayer made in the petition filed by the petitioner is for

                 grant of bail to him on medical grounds as he is suffering from

                 serious diseases.
</p>
<p id="p_2">                                The petitioner had initially moved this Court twice for the

                 grant of regular bail but his applications were dismissed on 18.9.2013

                 and 7.2.2014. He then filed another petition for grant of interim bail

                 on medical grounds which was accepted on 24.4.2014 by directing

                 his release on interim bail for a period of three weeks. The interim

                 bail was extended twice and finally on 5.8.2014 when no case was

                 made out for extending the said concession, the petition filed by the

                 petitioner was disposed of by directing the petitioner to surrender

                 before the jail authorities on 8.8.2014.       The jail authorities were,

                 however, directed to ensure that the petitioner was given necessary

                 medical assistance and treatment, including proper diet.

                                In the present petition, the petitioner has alleged that he

                 is a young boy of 18/19 years of age. He has been suffering from

                 HIV, black jaundice and TB.        Despite his ailing health, no proper

                 treatment has been provided to him by the jail authorities. He has

                 also not been allowed to have rest and on that account his condition

                 is worsening day by day.

<p id="p_3">                                On the last date of hearing, the State counsel had

                 informed the Court that out of the eight witnesses cited by the

                 prosecution, four had already been examined while the fifth partly

                 examined and his cross-examination stood deferred. The Court was

                 also told that though the petitioner was behind the bars since

                 29.1.2013 yet the prosecution could not examine its witnesses, who

                 were all police officials as they usually remained busy in performing

                 their official duties. Considering the said fact, the Court directed the

                 Senior Superintendent of Police, Kapurthala to remain present.

                 Pursuant to the same, Shri Ashish Choudhary, IPS, Senior

                 Superintendent of Police, District Kapurthala has put in appearance

                 and has also filed his affidavit. It has been mentioned therein that

                 the prosecution has already completed recording of its evidence and

                 now the trial is fixed for examination of the accused under <a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_1">Section

                 313</a> Cr.P.C. on 7.5.2015.

                 filed his reply by way of a short affidavit wherein it was mentioned

                 that the petitioner was a known case of HCV Reactive and HBsAg

                 Reactive.       On 21.1.2014, he was referred to Civil Hospital,

                 Kapurthala with complaint of anorexia. He was diagnosed as a case

                 of h/o Drug Addict and HCV test positive. He was investigated and

                 put on treatment advised by specialist doctor from Civil Hospital,

                 Kapurthala. He was again referred with complaint of skin infection,

                 Eczema to Civil Hospital, Kapurthala on 29.3.2014 where he was put

                 on advised treatment.        The petitioner was referred to PGIMER,

                 Chandigarh on 19.4.2014 for evaluation and management by some

                 Hepatologist but was checked in Department of internal Medicine,

                 OPD from where he was further referred to Hepatology Department.

                 It was also mentioned that after the expiry of the period for which the

                 petitioner was granted interim bail, he returned to Modern Jail,

                 Kapurthala where he was given same medicine as advised by

                 doctors from outside hospital. The petitioner was on TB treatment

                 from 16.5.2014. As he was HIV positive, he was given special diet in

                 jail. He was under regular follow-up from jail doctors.

                 from serious diseases like HIV, jaundice and TB and he is being

                 looked after by the jail authorities but as the prosecution has already

                 completed its entire evidence, this Court is of the considered view

                 that the petitioner can be granted bail on medical grounds so that he
