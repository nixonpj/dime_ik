AJAI LAMBA, J (Oral)

</pre><p id="p_1">                This petition has been filed under

<a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1">Article    226</a><a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_2">/227</a>         of       the     Constitution      of    India

praying for issuance of a writ in the nature of

certiorari, quashing the list published by the

respondents,     of        eligible           candidates      (Annexure

P-4) in regard to respondent No.9 and such other

persons.
</p>
<pre id="pre_3">                It         has         been       pleaded    that     the

petitioner     is      a    Junior            Engineer      holding     an

</pre><p id="p_2">additional charge of the post of Sub Divisional

Engineer and is deputed in Municipal Corporation,

Chandigarh. The petitioner obtained the degree in
 CWP No.18809 of 2009                                         [2]



B.Tech Civil (Water Resource Engineering) in the

year 2003.
</p>
<p id="p_3">                    It       has     been        pleaded       that        the

petitioner as also respondent No.9 applied for

the    post    of      Sub    Divisional          Engineer         (Civil).

Annexure P-4 is the list of eligible candidates

published        by       the        Punjab        Public           Service

Commission.       Respondent          No.9       has    been       shown    at

Serial No.342 in the list.
</p>
<p id="p_4">                    It        has         been         asserted           that

respondent No.9 is not eligible for appointment.

The list published by the Punjab Public Service

Commission, Patiala, indicates that the persons

who are ineligible such as respondent No.9, are

being    considered          as     eligible.          Learned      counsel

further contends that the facts have been made

known    to    the     respondents          by    way     of       filing    a

representation,           however,          the    respondents             are

going on with the selection process on inclusion

of     ineligible        candidates,         such       as     respondent

No.9.
</p>
<pre id="pre_4">                    So       far     as     respondent             No.9     is

concerned,        learned           counsel       states           that     he

</pre><p id="p_5">obtained the degree through distance education

from     the    Institute           of     Advanced          Studies        in

District       Churu,         Rajasthan           which        has        been

impleaded as respondent No.8 in the petition.

</p><p id="p_6">                     In view of the admitted fact that

selection has not been finalised, I am of the

considered          opinion        that        the   petition          is

premature. However, in view of the facts that

have       been    brought       out,     the    respondents          are

directed to consider a copy of the petition as

notice of the petitioner and consider the same

before considering the candidature of respondent

No.9 for selection for the post of Sub Divisional

Engineer (Civil).
