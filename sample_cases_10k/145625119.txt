</p><p id="p_15">         156(3) <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_3">Cr.P.C</a>. for seeking direction to SHO, P.S. Tilak Marg for registration of 

         FIR   against   the   accused.   The   brief   facts   of   the   case   as   narrated   in   the 

         complaint are as follows:­


                   Accused   no.1   is   primarily   doing   business   of   real   estate   agent   and  

                   accused no.2, 3 and 4 are its Directors.  The complainant was intending  

                   to   purchase   an   industrial   plot   and   therefore   he   engaged   accused  

                   persons for negotiating an industrial plot and made payment of Rs.15  

                   lakhs in the name of accused no.1 for purchasing an industrial plot in  

                   Tronica   City,   Loni,   Ghaziabad,  U.P.     On   28.05.2008,  the  complainant  

                   made further payment of Rs.35 lakhs on the insistence of accused no.2,  

                   3  and 4,  but in  the month of June, 2008 the accused persons found  

                   themselves unable to meet the commitment to secure viable and good  

                   purchase of industrial plot and therefore agreed to refund the abovesaid  

                   amount of Rs.50 lakhs by issuing five postdated cheques.   But these  

                   cheques got dishonoured on presentation due to the reason "Insufficient  

                   Funds"   and   the   complainant   filed   a   complaint   U/Sec.138   N.I.   Act   on  

                   09.03.2009 against the accused.  The complainant also filed a Civil Suit  

                   under Order XXXVII of C.P.C. in the Hon'ble High Court of Delhi bearing

                   CS (OS) No.951/2010 titled as "Hari Niwas Gupta Vs. Om Propmart Pvt.  

                   Ltd. &amp; Ors." for recovery of Rs.50 lakhs and in the month of September,  

                   2010, the accused persons filed application under O.37 R.3(5) C.P.C. for  

                   seeking   unconditional   leave   to   defend   and   alongwith   said   application  

                   they filed Agreement dated 02.04.2008 and MOU dated 24.05.2008.  But  

                   the complainant had never executed these documents.   His signatures  

                   were   forged   by   the   accused   persons   by   using   modern   computer  

                   technique   like   scanning   and   printing.     The   accused   had   committed  

                   forgery with ulterior and malafide motive to acquire wrongful gain.  The  

                   complainant had approached one handwriting expert who had given his  

                   opinion   regarding   the   documents   being   forged   documents.   The  

                   complainant had approached the police, but no action was taken by the  

                   police.

         Hence, the complainant filed the complaint U/Sec.200 r.w. Sec.156(3) <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_4">Cr.P.C</a>. 

         before the Court.

         filing of the complaint­cum­application by the complainant, the Action Taken 

         Report was called from the SHO, P.S. Tilak Marg and in the report, the I.O. 

         submitted that though agreement to sell and MOU was executed between the 

         complainant and the accused but due to recession in real estate market, the 

         complainant did not want to buy the plot and thus no cognizable offence was 

         made out.   But the counsel for complainant has requested for directing the 

         police   to   register   FIR   against   the   accused   and   to   investigate   the   matter. 

         However, it is settled law that order for registration of FIR U/Sec.156(3) <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_6">Cr.P.C</a>. 

         could   not   be   passed   in   every   case   in   a   mechanical   way   unless   there   are

                            cases   where   the   allegations   are   not   very   serious   and   the

                            allegations is such that the complainant himself may not be in a  

                            position to collect and produce evidence before the Court and  

                            interests of justice demand that the police should step in to help

                            can take an inquiry under Sec.200 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_9">Cr.P.C</a>. by examining the  

                            complainant and the other witnesses which are produced and

                            then proceed to deal with the complaint under <a href="/doc/1149595/" id="a_10">Sections 202</a>  

                            to <a href="/doc/1827798/" id="a_11">204</a> Cr.P.C.  It seems that the petitioner wants to bring bare  

                            pressure on the other side by registration of an FIR.  This is  

                            so on account of the fact that once an FIR is registered other  

                            side   namely   the   accused   persons   would   be   on   the   run  

                            because   they   will   face   an   imminent   threat   of   arrest   and  

                            secondly it becomes convenient for the complainant as well  

                            because it becomes a State case where the presence of the  

                            complainant is not required on every date of hearing.  That is  

                            the modus operandi which is invariably adopted and aimed at  

                            by every petitioner."

</p><p id="p_22">4.       In   the  present   case   the  allegations   against   the  accused   are  that   they   had 

         forged   the   signatures   of   the   complainant   on   the   Agreement   to   Sell   and 

         Memorandum of Understanding.  This Court is of considered opinion that it is 

         not a case where the police assistance is required for breaking the case or for 

         discovering some evidence which the complainant himself is unable to collect 

         at his own.   It is not a case where the evidence is beyond the reach of the 

         complainant or that the custodial interrogation is required for discovery of fact. 

         Therefore, the present case is not held to be a fit case for directing the SHO to 

         register FIR as the complainant himself can also lead the evidence. Therefore, 

         the   prayer   to   direct   the   SHO   to   register   the   FIR   is   declined.   However   the 

         cognizance of the offence is taken and the matter is adjourned for 25.11.2013 

         for pre­summoning evidence.</p><pre id="pre_2">
