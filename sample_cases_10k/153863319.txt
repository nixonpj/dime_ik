                                                                                       PO-MACT(NE)
                                                                                          Page no. 3/9
           alone by walking on the footpath. It is further deposed that there was dim light at that
          time and the road was damaged. Deceased Akram is his neighbour and at the time of
          accident deceased was riding the scooter. It is further deposed that the scooter of
          deceased was coming from his opposite side on its lane and there was divider between
          the road. He deposed that police interrogated him orally on next day.
          The evidence of PW 2 is cogent and corroborated by contents of FIR, MLC, PMR and
          the criminal case record. The postmortem report of the deceased shows that the
          deceased died due to accidental injuries. It is seen from the criminal case record filed
          by the petitioners that, the Police Station Welcome after completing investigation has
          filed charge sheet against respondent no.1 for the offences u/s 279 &amp; 304A <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_3">IPC</a>. The
          evidence of PW2 is corroborated by FIR, PMR and other documents in the record and
          that the deceased died due to the injuries sustained by him in an accident which is
          caused by the rash and negligent driving by respondent no.1. Even otherwise, there is
          no evidence adduced by respondents no.1 &amp; 2 to disprove the version of Pws.
          After considering entire material on record, I am of the view that the deceased Akram
          @ Vikram has suffered fatal injuries in an accident caused by respondent no.1 by
          driving the vehicle no. HR 38H 2889 in a rash and negligent manner. Accordingly,
          issue no.1 is decided in favour of the petitioners and against the respondents.

<p id="p_7">     7. ISSUES NO.2
          Whether petitioners are entitled to compensation?, If so, to what amount and from
          whom?
</p><p id="p_8">          It is stated by PW1 that her son was doing the work of plumber and was contributing
          his earnings to the family. It is also stated by PW1 that deceased was survived by her
          i.e. PW1, Mohd. Shamim who was 50 years (father of the deceased), Gulfar who was
          17 years (brother of the deceased), Seema who was 16 years (sister of the deceased) ,
          Khushboo who was 15 years (sister of the deceased), Ikram who was 14 years (brother
          of the deceased) and Gufran who was 13 years (brother of the deceased) who were
          solely dependent on the deceased. Ld. counsel for petitioner submit that deceased was
          only 26 years. Admittedly, petitioners are residents of Janta Mazdoor Colony, Delhi.
          Testimony of PW1 also establishes that the deceased was doing the work of plumber.
          In view of the testimony of PW 1 and the fact that there is no other evidence as to
          income and occupation of the deceased, I am of the opinion that minimum wages as
          applicable to the unskilled worker in Delhi on the date of the accident can be

            considered for the purpose of loss of dependency.
</p><p id="p_9">           According to the chart of minimum wages of unskilled worker working in Delhi as on
           the date of accident is Rs. 7020/-. It is stated by PWs that the deceased was about 26
           years old. Accordingly, multiplier of 17 is applicable for calculating loss of income, as
           per the dictum laid down in "Smt. Sarla Verma vs DTC 2009 AIR (SC) 3104".

                        persons as laid in Sarla Verma's case (supra) and to make it
                        applicable also to the self-employed and persons on fixed

                        groups is not 30% always; it will also have a reference to
                        the age. In other words, in the case of self-employed for
                        persons with fixed wages, In case, the deceased victim was
                        below 40 years, there must be an addition of 50% to the
                        actual income of the deceased while computing future
                        prospects. Needless to say that the actual income should be
                        income after paying the tax, if any. Addition should be 30%
                        in case the deceased was in the age group of 40 to 50 years".
</blockquote><p id="p_11">9.         On the other hand, counsel for respondents submit that since there is no fixed
employment, the future prospects cannot be considered. The argument of the counsel for
respondents is not sustainable as there is no law which bars a person without fixed
employment to develop and improve his standard of life and his capacity to earn more. Even
otherwise, the quantum of Minimum Wages itself, is revised time to time by the Government
which only proves that there is a scope for future prospects even to the labourers of
unorganized sector.

          years and therefore, multiplier applicable would be of 13 whereas as per the ld.
          Counsel for the plaintiff, as the deceased was aged 26 years, multiplier of 17 should be
          applicable on the basis of the age of the deceased and not of the basis of age of mother

Insurance Co. Ltd. &amp; Ors. 2012 VI AD(S.C.) 399 Civil Appeal no. 3397 of 2012, it has been
held that the selection of multiplier is to be based on the age of the deceased and not on the
basis of the age of dependents.

by Hon'ble Justice Suresh Kait, of Hon'ble High Court of Delhi, decided on 24.03.2014, the
question of appropriate multiplier in the case of unmarried deceased was raised and the issue,
whether the multiplier is to be ascertained on the basis of age of the deceased or on the basis
of age of the claimants was answered.
</p><p id="p_19">          It was held that in the ascertainment of purchasing capacity of the victim, the age of
          the claimant has no relevance because of the fact that it has no nexus with the
          assessment of the loss of dependency.
</p><p id="p_20">          It was further held that ........(i) age of the deceased (ii) income of the deceased and

          the multiplier.
</p><p id="p_22">          In the assessment of dependency, the courts/tribunals are computing the
          purchasing capacity of the deceased; not the claimants and therefore, the age of the
          victim is the proper factor for selecting the correct multiplier.
          As per dictum laid down in Mohd. Hasnain Vs. Jagram Meena's case multiplier to be
applied is 17. The deceased is unmarried. As per mother of the deceased, father of the
deceased is not doing anything and is unwell since last 4-5 years. There is no evidence to
show that the father of the deceased i.e petitioner no. 2 was dependent upon the deceased.

only mother is considered to be dependent. Therefore, 1/2 is deducted towards personal
expenses. As documentary proof regarding income of the deceased has not been placed on
record and therefore, income of the deceased is assessed as per the minimum wages on the
date of accident of an unskilled worker i.e Rs. 7020/- per month for the purpose of calculating
loss of dependency. Therefore, the total loss of dependency would be calculated as follows :
</p><p id="p_24">          Rs. 7020/-+ Rs. 3510/- (50% towards future prospects) = Rs. 10530/-

          The Hon'ble Supreme Court, in a judgment reported as National Insurance Company
