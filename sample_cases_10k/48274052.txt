appellant armed with wooden plank came to the house of the
complainant and gave blow on the head and right leg of

deceased with Bhavnagar City, B Division Police Station. In

Division Police Station CR No. I - 578 of 2006 came to be

investigation, charge sheet came to be filed against the
appellant. The offence committed by the appellant was

</pre><p id="p_9">2.5   At the end of trial, after recording the statement of the
accused under <a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_13">section 313</a> of the Cr.P.C and hearing
arguments on behalf of prosecution and the defence, the
learned Sessions Judge convicted the appellant of the charges
leveled against him by the impugned judgement and order.
</p>

<p id="p_10">3.    We have heard Mr. Madan Singh Barod, learned
advocate appearing for appellant and Mr. HS Soni, learned
Public Prosecutor appearing for respondent - State. We have
been taken through the ocular and documentary evidence
extensively by learned counsel appearing for either side.
</p>

<p id="p_11">4.    Mr. Barod, learned advocate appearing for the appellant
submitted that the case of the appellant is based on the
testimony of solitary eye witness who happens to be wife of
the deceased. It is his further contention that though other
eye witnesses were available, neither their statement under
<a href="/doc/48127346/" id="a_14">section 161</a> of the Code were recorded nor were they
examined as Prosecution Witnesses.           It is his further
contention that the doctor who initially treated and operated
upon the deceased is also not examined and that the
prosecution has not proved any enmity between the appellant



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_34">                              Page 5 of 11</span>

and deceased and that the panchas have turned hostile. He
has, therefore, urged that the trial court committed an error
in convicting the appellant.
</p>

<p id="p_12">4.1   Mr. Barod, in the alternative, submitted that if the court
ultimately believes the evidence of solitary eye witness then it
may be considered that this is a case of single blow and
therefore the case against the appellant would fall under
<a href="/doc/409589/" id="a_15">section 304</a>(Part I) of Indian Penal Code and thus he has
urged that the conviction of the appellant may be converted
into one under section 304 (Part I) from 302<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_16"> of Indian Penal
Code</a>.
</p>

<p id="p_13">5.    Learned        APP,     Mr.     Soni      supported     the   impugned
judgment and order of conviction and sentence and contended
that the weapon used for offence is discovered at the instance
of the appellant vide discovery panchnama Ex. 25. He further
contended that the FSL report reveals the blood stains of the
deceased and that as held by the Apex Court in the case of <a href="/doc/178895486/" id="a_17">R.
Shaji vs. State of Kerala</a> reported in AIR 2013 SC 651, it
is not the number of witnesses but the quality of their
evidence which is important.               Hence, he has submitted that
non-examination of so called witness does not in any way
adversely effect the prosecution case.                    He has therefore
submitted that the prosecution has successfully proved the
case against the appellant and there is no substance in the
appeal and the same may be dismissed.

documentary evidence recorded during the course of trial.

Ramjibhai Raiyabhai Makwana as P.W. 1 vide Ex. 20. She has
narrated the incident as it happened before her.             She is
subjected to stiff cross-examination but nothing helpful to the
appellant is elicited. She has stated in her oral evidence that
on the date of incident, the appellant had come with a wooden
plank in his hand and gave blows on the head and right leg of
her husband - deceased.          She has also stated that the
appellant also caught hold of her by her hair and gave kick
and fist blows. The evidence given by this witness is natural
and unblemished. The contention of the learned advocate for
the appellant that other eye witnesses are not examined by
the prosecution and therefore it dents the prosecution case
has no merits. The Apex Court in the case of R. Shaji (supra)
relied upon by learned APP, Mr. Soni in para 22 has observed
as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">            "22. In the matter of appreciation of evidence of
            witnesses, it is not the number of witnesses, but
            the quality of their evidence which is important, as
            there is no requirement in the law of evidence
            stating that a particular number of witnesses must
            be examined in order to prove/disprove a fact. It is
            a time-honoured principle, that evidence must be
            weighed and not counted. The test is whether the
            evidence has a ring of truth, is cogent, credible and
            trustworthy, or otherwise. The legal system has
            laid emphasis on the value provided by each
            witness, as opposed to the multiplicity or plurality
            of witnesses. It is thus, the quality and not
            quantity, which determines the adequacy of
            evidence, as has been provided by <a href="/doc/838383/" id="a_18">Section 134</a> of
            the Evidence Act. Where the law requires the
            examination of at least one attesting witness, it has
            been held that the number of witnesses produced
            over and above this, does not carry any weight.

<p id="p_15">6.1   Thus, it is not the number of witnesses examined by the
prosecution that matters but the quality of the evidence given
by the witnesses is important.                If the evidence of solitary
witness inspires confidence of the court in that case the
conviction can always be based on the basis of evidence of
such solitary eye witness.             We are unable to accept the
submission that the eye witness being related to the deceased
is an interested witness and therefore her testimony cannot
be relied upon. So far as PW 1 is concerned, it is no doubt
true that she is related to the deceased and for that reason
she may be interested witness. However, the law is well
settled that the testimony of a partisan or interested witness
cannot be discarded merely on that account. The testimony of
such a witness cannot be equated with that of a tainted
witness.
</p>

<p id="p_16">6.2   We are also unable to accept the submission of the
learned counsel for the appellant that if the prosecution does
not produce        independent        witness          and merely     produces
interested witnesses adverse inference be drawn. There is no
law   requiring          the   prosecution        to    necessarily   produce
independent witnesses and adverse inference be drawn
merely on account of their non-production.                      As we have
already stated in the foregoing paragraphs that P.W. 1 -
Vasantben had deposed in a very natural way and has stated

the incident as it seems to have happened. We do not find any
improvement or exaggeration in her evidence.
</p>

<p id="p_17">7.    Moreover, the evidence of P.W. 1 is supported by the
evidence of Dr. Kamna Gowekar, who is examined by the
prosecution as P.W. 3 vide Ex. 25. From the evidence of this
witness it transpires that the deceased had suffered two
injuries as reflected in column no. 17 of the post mortem
report at Ex. 27. Column no. 17 of the post mortem report
reads as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">            "17. (1) Mulitple scratch abrasions of 5 x 7 cm
            area on rt side of parietal region 5 cm rt to midline
            &amp; 7 cm above rt eyebrow.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">            (2) 6 cm shaped surgical stiched wound 8 cm on lt
            parietal occipital 5 cm region situated 3 cm lt to
            midline on removal of stiches margins are sharp
            and clear
            (3) About 10 x 8 cm bonechip removed surgically."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_18">7.1   According to the information of the doctor, injury no. 2
i.e. head injury was sufficient to cause death in natural
course. This witness has further stated in her evidence that
head injury as also other injury were possible by the wooden
plank. Therefore we are of the opinion that the learned trial
court has not committed any error in convicting the appellant
under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_25">section 302</a> of Indian Penal Code.
</p>

<p id="p_19">8.    So far as the alternative submission of learned advocate
for the appellant is concerned as regards convicting the
appellant under section 304 (Part I) instead of 304 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_26">IPC</a> is also
devoid of substance. It is very clear from the evidence of P.W.
1 - Vasantben that the appellant had come armed with a
wooden plank at the house of complainant and without any

provocation straightaway started assaulting the deceased and
thereafter assaulted the complainant who intervened while he
was assaulting the deceased. Therefore by no yardstick the
case against the appellant will fall under <a href="/doc/409589/" id="a_27">section 304</a> (Part I)
of Indian Penal Code.    It appears from the record that the
learned Sessions Judge noticed the vital aspects of the case
while holding that the prosecution had proved the offence as
committed by the appellant-accused.         The prosecution has
been able to prove the case against the appellant-accused and
therefore we see no reason to interfere.       As per the latest
decision of the Apex Court, we have appreciated, re-
appreciated and re-evaluated the evidence led before the trial
court in its entirety but we are unable to persuade ourselves
to take a different view than the one taken by the trial court.
