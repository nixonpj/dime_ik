                    is in judicial custody since 27.10.2018. The trial will take time to
                    conclude. There is no likelihood of his absconding or tampering with
                    the prosecution witness.      He is permanent resident of the address
                    mentioned in the appeal. Therefore, it is prayed that the appellant be
                    released on bail.
