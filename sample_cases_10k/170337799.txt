<p id="p_1">1            This is a succession petition filed by the Petitioners namely 

Sh. Surender, Miss Laxmi, Sh. Lalit, Kajal and Dalip for the grant of 

Succession Certificate in their favour qua the debts and securities left 

behind by deceased namely Smt. Guddi Devi, who died on 31.05.2011 

at Delhi. 
</p>
<p id="p_2">

</p><p id="p_3">2.           After filing of this petition, notice of filing of this petition 

was given to the general public by way of publication in the newspaper 

' THE STATESMAN ' dated 28.10.2013, but none has appeared from 

general public to oppose or contest the present petition.



3            The   deceased   Smt.   Guddi   Devi   was   the   mother   of   the 

petitioners namely   Sh. Surender, Miss Laxmi, Sh. Lalit, Kajal and 

Dalip.     She   expired   on   31.05.2011   at   New   Delhi   and   her   death 

certificate is Ex. PW­1/1.   Petitioners No. 4 and 5 namely Kajal and 

Petition No. 183/2013                                                         Page 2/4
 Dalip are minors and they are represented through petitioner No. 1 

being their elder brother.  Petitioners are the only class­I legal heir of 

the deceased.    The  husband of the deceased predeceased her.   The 

deceased made no WILL during her life time.  The deceased has left 

behind debts and securities as mentioned in para 6 of the petition, the 

copies of the same are Ex. PW­1/2 to Ex. PW­1/11.  



4            Therefore,  in view of the above, I am of the considered 

opinion   that   there   is   no   impediment   for   the   grant   of   Succession 

Certificate in favour of Petitioner namely  Sh. Surender, Miss Laxmi, 

Sh. Lalit, Kajal and Dalip qua the debts and securities of deceased 

namely   Smt.   Guddi   Devi.     I,   accordingly   direct   that   a   Succession 

Certificate be issued in favour of Petitioners namely   Sh. Surender, 

Miss Laxmi, Sh. Lalit, Kajal and Dalip to the extent of 1/5th share each 

qua the debts and securities of deceased namely Smt. Guddi Devi,  in 

terms of Ex. PW­1/2 to Ex. PW­1/11,  on filing of requisite court fee 

and on furnishing an Indemnity Bond with one surety within 15 days.

minors hence  their respective share be kept in term deposit till they
