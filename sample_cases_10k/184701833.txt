    the controversy in favour of assessees and Hon. Apex Court has granted
    special leave to appeal against it vide SLP (civil) 1203/2009. It is




                                                    
    connected to SLP (civil) 1126/2009. These Appeals are pending before
    this Court since 2008 and due to judgment of the Hon. Apex Court in




                                                   
    (2010) 13 SCC 527---<a href="/doc/1924120/" id="a_6">Deputy Commissioner of Income Tax, Nashik vs.

    order of assessment has failed to consider same material aspects as noted
    by the Hon. Apex Court and the Real Income theory as also theory of
                           
    Overriding Title. The question whether <a href="/doc/1353793/" id="a_7">Section 40-A(2)</a> applies to a
    Cooperative Society is being answered by the Hon. Apex Court in above
    SLPs but then in decided matter, assessee Shri Satpuda Tapi Parisar SSK
      


    Ltd. is also a cooperative society. The verdict of Hon. Apex Court will put
   



    an end to this controversy either way, but time becoming available till then
    can be utilized to ascertain basic facts essential for proper assessment as
    laid down by the Hon. Apex Court. It also helps assessee to understand the





    correct mode &amp; manner of writing their accounts in future. Hence, it is not
    expedient to keep the matter pending or adjourn it. We find that the
    respective orders of assessment before us also suffer from the defects





    pointed out by Hon. Apex Court. Two judgments of the Hon. Apex Court
    having direct bearing on the controversy involved in all these appeals must
    be looked into first.

    <a href="/doc/1924120/" id="a_8">Deputy Commissioner of Income Tax, Nashik vs. Shri Satpuda Tapi




                                                                                
    Parisar SSK Ltd</a>. is most important. Here. the Hon. Apex Court after
    hearing extensive arguments on the applicability of <a href="/doc/1353793/" id="a_9">Section 40-A(2)</a> of the




                                                        
    Income Tax Act, 1961, as it stood at the relevant time, has found that a
    large number of questions had remained unanswered. Hon. Apex Court




                                                       
    states that the applicability of <a href="/doc/1353793/" id="a_10">Section 40-A(2)</a> of the Income Tax Act,
    1961 is linked to computation under <a href="/doc/555776/" id="a_11">Section 28</a> and <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_12">Section 37</a> of the Act.
    It was the case of the Department in all cases before Hon. Apex Court that




                                            
    the State advised price (SAP) is determined on the basis of the price
                             
    recommended by the assessee(s) after the finalization of accounts and,
    therefore, the differential amount between SAP and SMP would constitute
                            
    appropriation of profits and not expenditure/expense under <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_13">Section 37</a> of
    the Act. It was the case of the assessee(s)- a cooperative sugar factory that
    they were/are bound to pay to the cane growers ,the final cane price as per
      


    the SAP fixed by the State Government and the mere fact that SAP fixed
   



    by the State Government is based on the price recommended by the
    assessee(s)   after     finalization   of    accounts   would       not     constitute
    appropriation of profits because appropriation would arise only after the





    profits are determined and profits can be determined only after all the
    expenses incurred for the business are deducted from the gross income.
    Hon. Apex Court notices that on the above contentions, two questions





    required to be considered by the Department are as follows:
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_1">                          "Whether the abovementioned differential payment

                      whether such differential payment would, applying
                      the real income theory, constitute an expenditure

                          igIn a given case, if the assessee has made a
                     provision in its accounts, then the assessing officer
                     shall enquire whether such provision is made out of
                        
                     profits or from gross receipts and whether such
                     differential payment is relatable to the cost of the
                     sugarcane or whether it is relatable to the division
                     of profits amongst the members of the Society? One
      


                     of the points which will also arise for determination
                     by the assessing officer will be on the theory of
   



                     overriding title in the matter of accrual or
                     application of income. Therefore, in each of these
                     cases, the assessing officer will decide the question





                     as to whether the obligation is attached to income
                     or to its source.

    diversion of his income by overriding title . It lays down that the share of

    partnership, it is the partner and the partner alone who is entitled to profits





    and a stranger, even if he were an assignee, does not have and cannot have
    any direct claim to the profits. Thus, when a third person becomes entitled

<p id="p_11">    7.           We very briefly point out what the respective assessment
    orders in matters before us do. The fact that SAP is more than SMP and




                                                    
    SAP is fixed at the initiative of assessee Cooperative Societies has been
    only noted &amp; given importance. It is held that after ascertaining the profits,




                                         
    respective assessees moved the State Government for determination of
    SAP and thus, it is diversion of profits. As an illustration of application of
                          
    mind &amp; by way of specimen, We reproduce the observations in paragraph
    4.4 of his assessment order dated 16.03.2004 by DCIT, Ahmednagar
                         
    circle, Ahmednagar in the matter of assessee Shree Ganesh Sahkari Sakhar
    Karkhana Ltd. for assessment year 2001--2002 in Tax Appeal 29 of 2008
    before us. He observes-

<blockquote id="blockquote_5">                 "Where by obligation income is diverted before it
                 reaches the assessee, it is not deductible , but where the
                 income is required to be applied to discharge an





                 obligation, self-imposed or gratuitous, after such
                 income reaches the assessee, the same consequence,in
                 law, does not follow. It is the first kind of payment
                 which can not be excused from taxation &amp; not the
                 second. The second payment is merely an obligation to





                 pay another, a portion of one's own income, which has
                 been received &amp; since appropriated; while the first type
                 of payment which is diverted before it reaches to the
                 assessee, tantamounts to alienation of income &amp; is not
                 exempt from tax. Therefore, such being the position, the
                 income which has been alienated by way of excess cane
                 price payment to members &amp; nonmembers in the shape

                of final cane payment, as per order of the
                Commissioner of Sugar,M.S., over &amp; above the initial
                price fixed by the Government is said to be alienated




                                                                            
                before it reaches to the assessee and it tantamounts to
                assessee's income liable to chargeable to tax, and

    respective bye-laws, by various government decisions or resolutions of its




                                        
    own are not looked into and also, are not pressed into service by these

    directed by Hon. Apex Court in paragraphs 5 &amp; 6 of its judgment in
                        
    <a href="/doc/1924120/" id="a_21">Deputy Commissioner of Income Tax, Nashik vs.Shri Satpuda Tapi

    CIT(Appeals), we also adopt the same course. Accordingly, We quash &amp;

    final hearing as per paragraph 8 in <a href="/doc/1924120/" id="a_22">Deputy Commissioner of Income Tax,
    Nashik vs. Shri Satpuda Tapi Parisar SSK          Ltd</a>.(supra). Needless to
