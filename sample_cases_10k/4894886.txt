                            ORDER

<p id="p_1">Pius C. Kuriakose, J


      Under challenge in this revision filed by the tenant is

the judgment of the Appellate Authority confirming the

order of eviction which was passed by the Rent Control

Court against him on the grounds of arrears of rent under

Section 11(2)(b) and re-construction under Section 11(4)

</p><p id="p_2">(iv). It was relying on a rental arrangement evidenced by

Ext.A5 that the RCP was instituted by the landlord. The

landlord sought for eviction on the grounds of arrears of

rent under Section 11(2)(b); bona fide need for own

occupation under Section 11(3) and need for re-construction

under Section 11(4)(iv). All the grounds were contested to

at the time of trial. The landlord conceded that eviction

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">R. C. R. No.74 of 2011         -2-</span>



under Section 11(3) is not pressed. One of the contentions

raised by the revision petitioner was that the document of

title under which the landlord claims ownership over the

building is a sham document or rather a benami document

executed by his father in the name of his eldest son,

Sri.Venugopalan who is the father of the respondent for the

benefit of all his children. Incidentally it was also contended

that there is no landlord-tenant relationship between the

parties.
</p>
<p id="p_3">       2. In the enquiry before the Rent Control Court the

evidence consisted that of PW1, the father of the landlord

and Exts.A1 to A9. On the side of the revision petitioner the

evidence was nil. The Rent Control Court on evaluating the

evidence would first decide that the contentions raised by

the revision petitioner against the title of the landlord and

against the existence of a landlord-tenant relationship are

only to be repelled. On evaluating the evidence it was held

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">R. C. R. No.74 of 2011        -3-</span>



that the eviction ground under Section 11(2)(b) and under

Section 11(4)(iv) stood establish.
</p>
<p id="p_4">       3. The learned Appellate Authority considered appeal

preferred by the revision petitioner. That authority re-

appraised the entire evidence and concurred with all the

conclusions of the Rent Control Court. Accordingly, the

appeal was dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_5">       4. In this revision various grounds are raised

challenging the judgment of the Appellate Authority.

Sri.A.R.Gangadas, the learned counsel for the revision

petitioner addressed very strenuous arguments before us

based on the grounds. Sri.Gangadas submitted at the very

outset that RSA No.376/11 has been preferred by the

revision petitioner against the verdict of the civil court which

was in favour of the respondent/landlord. According to

Sri.Gangadas the learned Appellate Authority relied on the

appellate      judgment and    turned   down     the    revision

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">R. C. R. No.74 of 2011         -4-</span>



petitioner's contention based on title. According to the

learned counsel, it is only appropriate that this RCR and the

RSA be heard and decided together. Sri.Gangadas would

attack the eviction order on merits also. According to him,

the judgment of the Appellate Authority is vitiated by so

many illegalities, irregularities and improprieties justifying

interference in revision.
</p>
<p id="p_6">       5. Sri.V.Chitambaresh, the learned senior counsel for

the respondent submitted that though it is true that the

learned Appellate Authority has referred to the judgment of

the civil court, the suit before the civil court is not a

comprehensive suit for title. It is a simple suit for injunction

to restrain the revision petitioner from doing repair work in

the building. It has nothing to do with the title.

Sri.Chitambaresh submitted that it cannot be said that there

is a bona fide denial of landlord's title. What was challenged

was proprietory title. Despite that challenge since the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">R. C. R. No.74 of 2011        -5-</span>



revision petitioner set up an agreement for sale it can be

found that the challenge on title is not serious. Ext.A5

proves the existence of a landlord-tenant relationship. To

whatever evidence is adduced by the landlord there is not

even formal counter evidence.
</p>
<p id="p_7">       6. We have very anxiously considered the rival

submissions addressed at the Bar. We have gone through

the judgment of the Appellate Authority and the order of the

Rent Control Court. The short question which arises before

us is whether the judgment of the Appellate Authority

confirming the order of eviction passed by the Rent Control

Court warrants interference within the contours of the

revisional jurisdiction of this Court under Section 20.

According to us, the above question can be answered only

against the revision petitioner. We are not at all impressed

by the contentions raised by the revision petitioner touching

the title of the landlord. First of all as far as rent control

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">R. C. R. No.74 of 2011         -6-</span>



proceedings are concerned it is not the proprietary title over

the building that is important. What is important is only the

landlord's entitlement to receive the rent or the existence of

a landlord-tenant relationship. Ext.A5 is one document

relied on in the Rent Control Petition and in the evidence by

the landlord, for which there is not even a formal counter

evidence is adduced by the revision petitioner. In the

absence of even formal counter evidence, the authorities

below cannot be faulted at all for having concluded that

there exists a landlord-tenant relationship between the

parties. Though we are not concerned with the question of

proprietary title we do find merit in the submission of

Sri.Chitambaresh that party who denied the title and at the

same time sets up an agreement for sale executed by the

landlord, is practically conceding the landlord's proprietary

title also. At any rate as the finding entered by the statutory

authorities regarding the existence of the eviction ground

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">R. C. R. No.74 of 2011       -7-</span>



are based on evidence available on record we do not find

any infirmity about them. The revision petition necessarily

has to fail and the eviction order stands confirmed. At the

same time, the last submission of Sri.Gangadas, the learned

counsel for the revision petitioner that a reasonably long

period of time be given to the tenant for surrendering the

premises has some appeal to us. Hence, even as we dismiss

the RCR confirming the eviction order passed by the Rent

Control Court, there will be a direction to the execution

court to keep in abeyance all proceedings for delivery till

31/12/11 subject to certain conditions. The result of the

above discussion is as follows:-
</p>
<p id="p_8">       7. The RCR is dismissed confirming the order passed

under Section 11(2)(b) and 11(4)(iv). The order of eviction

passed by the Rent Control Court under Section 11(2)(b)

can be got vacated by making requisite deposit under

Section 11(2)(c) and filing application within two months

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">R. C. R. No.74 of 2011          -8-</span>



from today. Order of eviction passed under Section 11(4)

</p><p id="p_9">(iv) will not be executed till 31/12/11 subject to the

following conditions:-
</p>
<p id="p_10">       8. Revision petitioner shall file an affidavit before the

execution court or the Rent Control Court as the case may

be within three weeks from today undertaking to give

peaceful surrender of the building to the respondent on or

before 31/12/11 and undertaking further that arrears of rent

as found by the Rent Control Court will be paid off within

two months and that occupation charges at the existing rent

rate will also be paid without fail on the first of every month.

The revision petitioner will get the benefit of time granted as

above only if the affidavit as directed above is filed on time

and the undertakings contained therein are honoured.

</p><p id="p_11">       9. We clarify that the respondent will be bound to carry

out the re-construction and allot more or less equal area to

the revision petitioner as provided under the third proviso to

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">R. C. R. No.74 of 2011        -9-</span>



Section 11(4)(iv) of Act 2 of 1965 within the time frame set

by the Appellate Authority.
