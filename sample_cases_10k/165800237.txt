              ­:                  
</p>
<p id="p_3">           It  is  the  case  of  the  prosecution  that  on  11.04.2012  on 
    receipt of DD No.48A to the effect that "Masjid ke piche bank ke  
    pass,   A­Block   husband   ko   chaku   maar  diya",   SI   Avtar   Singh 
    alongwith Ct. Jai Kumar reached at GTB Hospital where they 
    collected   the   MLC  No.A­1559/12  of   one   Ashok  S/o   Vijay  Pal 
    upon which doctor mentioned as "alleged H/O physical assault 
    (sharp injury) at 9 p.m on 11.04.2012 at Gokal Puri, Delhi".  The 
    doctor   found   patient   fit   for   statement   and   result   was   under 
    observation.  Accordingly, IO recorded the statement of injured 
    Ashok,   wherein   he   alleged   that  11.04.12   at   about   9.00   p.m, 
    accused Ravinder @ Rinku called him and accordingly he came 
    out from his house at IIIrd Fllor, in the gali and he found that 
    Ravinder   @   Rinkoo   alongwith   Dev   Chauhan   and   Rahul,   to 
    whom he know prior to the incident, were also standing there. 
    When he asked   Ravinder as to why he called him, on this he 
    took him about 15­20 meters away from his house and told him 
    that  "holi wale din tuh bada badmash ban raha tha"  and while 
    saying these words they all started giving beatings to him with 
    kicks and fist blows. When he resisted, accused Ravinder and 
    Dev Chauhan caught hold of him and Ravinder told to Rahul 
    "aaj iska kaam tamam kar de, isne hume bada pareshan kar 
    rakha hai, aaj bhi isne state bank ke saame meri motorcycle ki 
    chabi nikal kar mujhe behan ki gaali di thi".   While saying so, 
    accused Rahul attacked upon him with Chhuri with intent to kill 
    him and he gave many churi (knife) blows to him. Some how, 
    after releasing his hand, he hold the chhuri (knife) of Rahul and 
    raised alarm and on hearing his noise his wife and Rahul etc. 
    (his colleagues) came there and on seeing them Ravinder, Dev 
    Chauhan   and   Rahul   ran   away   from   there.   His   wife   and 

State Vs. Ravinder @ Rinku etc. (SC No.48/2012)                    Page No. 2 of pages 7
    colleague Rahul took him to GTB Hospital. From the statement 
   and MLC, offence punishable U/s 307/34 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_4">IPC</a> were found to be 
   committed and accordingly SI/IO prepared a rukka and got the 
   FIR registered in the instant case by sending Ct. Jai Kumar to 
   PS alongwith rukka.  Thereafter, the investigation in the matter 
   was carried out and during that course at the instance of Rahul 
   (who was working with injured Ashok), IO prepared Site Plan. 
   Exhibits were collected from the spot.  Photographs of the wall 
   having blood stains on it were taken by the IO from his mobile 
   camera.   Thereafter, IO alongwith Ct. Jai Kumar went to GTB 
   Hospital   where   the   statement   of   the   wife   of   injured   was 
   recorded   and   clothes   of   injured   were   taken   into   police 
   possession. On the pointing out and identification of the sister in 
   law   (bhabi)   of   injured   Ashok,   accused   Ravinder   @   Rinku, 
   Rahul and Dev Chauhan were arrested in this case and their 
   disclosure   statements   were   recorded   in   this   case.   At   the 
   instance   of   accused   Rahul,   weapon   of   offence   i.e.   knife   was 
   recovered. Statements of witnesses were recorded. Result on 
   the   MLC   of   injured   was   obtained   which   came   as   grievous. 
   Thereafter, on completion of investigation charge sheet U/s 307/ 
   323/365/34   <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_5">IPC</a>   was  filed   before   the   court   of   concerned 
   Metropolitan Magistrate.
</p><p id="p_4">3.         After supply of copies etc, Ld.MM committed the case to 
   the   court   of   Sessions   where   after   due   deliberation   charge 
   charge   under   Sec.307/34   <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_6">IPC</a>   was   framed   against   all   the 
   accused persons, to which they pleaded not guilty and claimed 
   trial. Thereafter, the case was fixed for prosecution evidence. 
</p><p id="p_5">4.          To prove its case, the prosecution has cited as many as 
   fifteen   witnesses   out   of   them   it   has  examined   five   witnesses 
   including the star witness i.e. PW­4 Ashok Kumar (injured) but 
   he has not supported the case of the prosecution at all and rest 
   of   the   witnesses   are   official   witnesses,   who   deposed   in   their 

State Vs. Ravinder @ Rinku etc. (SC No.48/2012)                    Page No. 3 of pages 7
    respective   testimonies   about   role   played   by   them   during   the 
   course of  investigation.  PW­4  Ashok  Kumar  has categorically 
   stated that the person, who stabbed him was of short hight and 
   that person is not present in the court. He categorically denied 
   that   all   the   accused   persons   are   the   same   persons,   who 
   inflicted injuries to him.  
</p><p id="p_6">          Although   the   said   witness   i.e.   PW­4   Ashok   Kumar   was 
   cross examined on behalf of the prosecution at great length but 
   nothing   incriminating   material   could   be   extracted   from   the 
   mouth of said witness. 
</p><p id="p_7">5.        It  is pertinent to mention here that in this case process 
   were issued to PWs Nutan (wife of injured), Rahul (employee of 
   injured)   and   Sushma   twice   i.e.   for   30.09.2013   &amp;   25.11.2013 
   through   DCP   and   SHO   concerned   respectively,   for   their 
   appearance and recording of their statements but they could not 
   be  served  and produced  as  their  process  received  back  with 
   report   left   the   given   address.   Even   for   today,   the   process 
   against the said witnesses were directed to be served through 
   DCP (North East) but result remained the same (i.e. the process 
   received   with   the   report  the   addresses  have   left   the   address 
   and have gone to unknown place). 
</p><p id="p_8">6.        In   the   case   in   hand,   where   the   star   witness   of   the 
   prosecution i.e. PW­4 Ashok Kumar (complainant/injured) has 
   completely   turned   hostile   and   has  not   supported   the   story  of 
   prosecution  on  the point  of  identities  of the  accused  persons 
   and   the   other   public   witnesses   are   untraceable   and   their 
   whereabouts are not known, I had no option but to close the 
   prosecution   evidence   as   no   fruitful   purpose   could   have   been 
   served   by   continuing   the   trial   by   examining   the   remaining 
   witnesses as it would be a futile exercise and accordingly the 
   prosecution evidence was closed vide the order of even date. 
   Since   there   is   nothing   incriminating   against   the   accused 

State Vs. Ravinder @ Rinku etc. (SC No.48/2012)                   Page No. 4 of pages 7
    persons has been brought on record, so statement of accused 
   persons u/s 313 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_7">Cr.P.C</a> is also dispensed with.   
</p><p id="p_9">7.        Having heard the respective rival submissions of Ld. Addl. 
   PP for the State and Ld. counsel for the accused persons and in 
   view   of   the   circumstances   where   the   star   witness   of   the 
   prosecution i.e. PW­4 Ashok Kumar has not supported the case 
   of the prosecution, I have no option but to acquit all the accused 
   persons of the charges. All the accused persons stand acquitted 
   accordingly.   Their   existing   Bail   Bonds   and   Surety   Bonds   are 
   extended for the period of six months in terms of the order of

statements but they could not be served and produced and their 
process received back with report "left the given address". Even 
for today, the process for the said witnesses were directed to be 
served through DCP (North East) but result remained the same 
and the process again received back unserved with the report "the

the prosecution has been failed to produce the witnesses i.e. PWs 
Nutan (wife of injured), Rahul (employee of injured) and Sushma

result remained the same.  It is also submitted by Ld. Counsel for 
accused  persons   that   since   the   star   witness  of   prosecution   i.e. 
PW­4 Ashok Kumar has not supported the case of prosecution at 
all   and   other   PWs   could   not   be   produced   before   court   by   the 
prosecution for their examination, so prosecution evidence may be
