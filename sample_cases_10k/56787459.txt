     THIS CRL.RP IS FILED U/SS.397 AND 401 OF CR.P.C
PRAYING TO SET ASIDE THE ORDER DATED 27.10.2012 PASSED
BY THE IX A.C.M.M., BANGALORE IN C.C.NO.38076/2010 AND
DISCHARGE THE PETITIONER.

    THIS CRIMINAL REVISION PETITION COMING ON FOR
ADMISSION, THIS DAY, THE COURT MADE THE FOLLOWING:
                                  2


                              ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">     Though this matter has come up for admission, with

consent it is taken up for final disposal.
</p>
<p id="p_2">     2. The petitioner who is A2 is C.C.No.38076/2010

aggrieved by the order dated 27.10.2010 passed by the IX

Addl. Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Bangalore, dismissing

his application filed u/s.239 of <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_1">Cr.P.C</a>. is before this Court

assailing the said order.
</p>
<p id="p_3">
</p><p id="p_4">     3.   It is the case of the prosecution during the year

2002, CW1 had got executed certain interior works in the

Bank run by CW12.           In respect of the same he was due

certain amount from CW12.            In this connection he had

approached the accused who are running their office under

the name and style Karnataka State Home Rights Council

and had requested them to get the money from the said Bank

of CW12. In response to the same A1 and A2 directed CW1

to become member of their council by depositing Rs.10,000/-

and they directed him to provide his JIPSY car for their use.

Thereafter it is alleged the accused never got the money, on

the other hand they confined him in a room, abused him in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                    3</span>


 filthy language, assaulted him and also threatened him with

dire consequences at the point of revolver.

</p><p id="p_5">      4. Sri.M.S.Rajendra Prasad, learned Senior counsel

appearing      for    the   petitioner    referring    to   the   letter

dt.11.7.2007         addressed   by      CW1   to     A1-Vivekananda

submitted the name of this petitioner does not appear in the

said letter.   The transaction that is involved in the present

complaint is referred to in the said letter.          He submits one

Rishi who is the accused, mentioned in the said letter who

according to the complainant is a driver and had come to his

office on 11.7.2007, has been given up in the present case.

Involvement of this petitioner is after lapse of 3 years in the

complaint filed by CW1. Since his name had not figured in

the letter dated 11.7.2007 addressed by the complainant to

A1, involvement of the petitioner is an after thought and the

learned Magistrate without appreciating these materials on

record has erred in coming to the conclusion that there are

sufficient grounds to proceed against him. Therefore, the

order cannot be sustained, it be set aside and the petitioner

be discharged by allowing the application filed by him.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                               4</span>


</p><p id="p_6">      5. Per contra, the learned HCGP supported the

impugned order of the Trial Magistrate.
</p>
<p id="p_7">     6. I have gone through the letter dated 11.7.2007

annexed to the complaint filed by CW1 addressed by CW1 to

A1. In my view the contents of the said letter has no nexus

whatsoever with the allegations that has been made in the

present complaint. In the present complaint the allegation is,

this petitioner and two others, who are arrayed as accused,

had directed the complainant to become member of their

council by depositing Rs.10,000/- and they had promised to

get him the amount from CW12 in respect of the work he had

executed in the Bank run by CW12. It further discloses they

have also confined him to a room, abused him, assaulted him

and threatened him with dire consequences at the point of a

revolver. These allegations are not found in the letter dated

11.7.2007 i.e. in respect of the complainant requesting to

return certain mobile and documents which had been taken

by them on that particular day. Since the material on record

prima facie makes out a case against this petitioner for the

offences alleged and as the petitioner has not been able to

show that there are no sufficient grounds to proceed against
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                              5</span>


 him   as    contemplated   u/s.239   of   <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_2">Cr.P.C</a>.,   in   the

circumstances I do not find any infirmity in the order of the

learned Magistrate calling for interference in this revision.

Accordingly, there is no merit in the petition and it is

dismissed.
