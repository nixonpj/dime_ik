</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">             "i)  The Hon'ble Court may kindly be pleased to issue appropriate
             writ/order/direction and please to quash the impugned charge sheet
             dated 22.09.2018 (Annexure-P/7) passed by respondent No.1 and also
             departmental enquiry initiated on the basis of charge sheet vide letter
             dated 29.09.2019 (Annexure-P/9) be quashed, in the interest of
             justice.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">             ii) The Hon'ble Court may kindly be pleased to direct the
             respondents to release entire retiral benefits to the petitioner
             towards provident fund, gratuity, group insurance, leave
             encashment and other retiral benefits along with 18 interest, in
             the interest of justice.

<blockquote id="blockquote_3">             iii) Any other relief which this Hon'ble Court deem fit may also
             be granted."</blockquote><p id="p_3">


</p><p id="p_4">      Learned counsel for the petitioner has submitted that

petitioner has been retired from service on 30.09.2018, but the

charge sheet though dated 22.09.2018                      was served on him on

26.09.2018. It is submitted that in such circumstances the

departmental enquiry cannot be proceeded which has also been held

by    the    Co-ordinate          Bench         of     this      Court        in       W.P.

Warehousing And Logistice Corporation) on 02.01.2019,

the relevant paragraphs of the same read as under:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_4">          "Shri Praveen Dubey, learned counsel for the
          corporation fairly submits that he is unable to show
          any enabling provision which permits the employer to
          continue with the inquiry after retirement of an
          employee. He is unable to show that the order passed
          in Ramcharan Yadav (supra) will not cover the case
          of the petitioner.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">                  This is trite law that the employee/ employer
          relationship comes to an end on the retirement of an
          employee. The employer can continue with the inquiry
          only when there exists an enabling provision to
          continue with such inquiry after retirement of an
          employee. This kind of provision exists for the State
          Government employees in clause-9 of M.P. Civil
          Service (Pension) Rules, 1976. In absence of showing
          any similar enabling provision, petition deserves to
          succeed. No useful purpose would be served in
          permitting the employer to keep the sword of
          disciplinary proceedings/charge sheet hanging on the
          head of the petitioner.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_6">                  Resultantly,    the   charge    sheet    dated
          22.09.2018 and disciplinary proceedings founded upon
          it are set aside. The petitioner shall reap all
          consequential benefits as if the said charge sheet has
          not been issued. The employer is directed to release
          all the consequential benefits to the petitioner within
          three months from the date of production of copy of
          this order."</blockquote><p id="p_8">


</p><p id="p_9">      Thus, it is submitted by the learned counsel for the petitioner

that the petition be allowed in the light of the aforesaid order.

<p id="p_12">                                      Learned counsel for the respondents on the other hand has

                      opposed the prayer. However he is not able to demonstrate that as

                      to why the aforesaid order passed by this Court is distinguishable.

                      admissible retiral benefits emanating from the date of his
