                        KARKARDOOMA COURTS, DELHI



Suit no. 121/09/10
Unique case ID no. : 02402C 0329502007


Muzzaiyana Parveen &amp; Others                                  .........Plaintiff 

vs. 

Firoz Alam &amp; Others                                         ......... Defendants



ORDER:
</pre>
<p id="p_1">1.       Vide this order, I shall dispose of the present application under 

Order 7 Rule 11 CPC moved by the defendants against the plaintiff. 



</p><p id="p_2">2.       Brief facts of the case relevant for adjudication of the present 

application as per  plaintiff are that the plaintiff has filed the present 

suit   for  recovery   of   possession,  rendition of   accounts  and  damages 

against the defendant. The defendants filed their WS and thereafter 

both the parties led their evidence. Final arguments have already been 

heard in this matter. The defendant has moved the present application 

stating that the on 28.02.12 the plaintiff has made the statement before 

the   court   that   value   of   the   suit   property   is   Rs.20,00,000/足.   The 


Suit no. 121/09/10                                                       Page no. 1 of 3
 defendant vide the present application has stated that the suit of the 

plaintiff is liable to rejected u/o 7 Rule 11 CPC for being without any 

cause of action as they have not valued the suit property properly and 

there is no cause of action in favour of the plaintiff. The plaintiff has 

orally   argued   the   said   application   and   stated   that   since   the   final 

arguments   have   already   been   heard   in   this   matter,   the   present 

application at this stage can not be entertained and have prayed that 

the application be dismissed with costs. 
</p>
<p id="p_3">

</p><p id="p_4">5.       I have heard the arguments on behalf of both the parties and 

carefully perused the record. It is a trite law that for the purposes of 

deciding an application under Order 7 Rule 11 CPC, only the contents 

of the plaint are to be seen. The plaintiff had at the time filing of the 

suit valued the suit for the purposes of court fees and jurisdiction. It is 

also relevant to note that the defendant had moved an application u/o 7 

Rule 11 CPC wherein it was urged that the suit has not been properly 

valued   for   the   purposes   of   court   fees   and   jurisdiction.   The   said 

application of the defendants was dismissed by the court vide order 

dated 11.04.08. It is also relevant to mention that issues in the present 

court were framed by this court on 20.05.09 wherein the issue with 

respect to valuation of the suit property had been framed as issue no. 


</p><pre id="pre_2">Suit no. 121/09/10                                                        Page no. 2 of 3
 two.     Issue   No.3   in   the  present  case  in  whether  this  court  has  the 

</pre><p id="p_5">jurisdiction to try the present suit.  In the facts and circumstances of 

the   case   I   am   of   the   opinion   that   when   the   issue   with   respect   to 

valuation of the suit property and whether this court has jurisdiction to 

try the present suit have already been framed by this court there is no 

reason whatsoever to decide on those issues by way of this application. 

These issues would  be decided with the main suit and as the final 

arguments have already been heard in this matter I am of the opinion 

that no ground is made out for the present application at this stage. 

The   present   application   is   accordingly   dismissed   with   cost   of   Rs. 

1000/足.
