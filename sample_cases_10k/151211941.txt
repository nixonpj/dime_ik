      Order No.09 Dated- 14.05.2019
</pre><p id="p_6">            Apprehending their arrest in connection with C.P. Case No.684 of 2015
      instituted under <a href="/doc/1436241/" id="a_1">Sections 420</a>, <a href="/doc/1128948/" id="a_2">120(B)</a> of the Indian Penal Code, the petitioners
      have moved this Court for grant of privileges of anticipatory bail.
</p><p id="p_7">            Heard the parties.
</p><p id="p_8">            Learned senior counsel appearing for the petitioners submits that the
     allegation against the petitioners is that the petitioner No.1 being the Director of
     Enar Industrial Enterprises Ltd. and petitioner No.2 being the Manager of Enar
     Industrial Enterprises Ltd. have sold an old Tata truck to the complainant and
     later on it was found that the said truck was having an outstanding tax dues of
     Rs.1,00,000/- in the State of Orissa. It is submitted that the allegation against the
     petitioners is false. It is then submitted that the petitioners had no knowledge
     that the vehicle which was sold to the complainant, was having an outstanding
     tax liability of Rs.1,00,000/- and there is also no specific allegation against the
     petitioners that they had any knowledge about the same at the time of selling
     the said old vehicle to the complainant. Drawing attention of this Court towards
     page-33 of the brief, learned senior counsel for the petitioners submits that the
     enquiry witness namely Ratnesh Sinha has categorically stated that the company
     of the petitioners has already paid Rs.60,000/- to the complainant and the
     petitioners are ready and willing to pay ad interim victim compensation of
     Rs.50,000/- each without prejudice to their defence in this case to the
     complainant namely- Santosh Kumar. It is also submitted that no offence
     punishable in law is made out against the petitioners and the dispute between
     the parties is basically a civil dispute. Hence, it is submitted that the petitioners
     be given the privileges of anticipatory bail.
</p><p id="p_9">               Learned Addl.P.P appearing for the State being assisted by the learned
       counsel for the opposite party No.2 oppose the prayer for anticipatory bail of the
       petitioners and submit that since the vehicle got transferred from the earlier
       purchaser to the name of the company of the petitioners in the Registration
       Office of Orissa, the presumption is that the petitioners were aware about the
       outstanding tax dues but they fairly submit that the factum of the knowledge of
       the petitioners about the tax liability of the vehicle sold was in the knowledge of
       the petitioner has not been specifically averred in the complaint. It is next
       submitted that because of the national permit for the said vehicle being not
       issued, the informant sustained severe loss and he could not pay the installment
       dues of IndusInd Bank from which bank he took a loan of Rs.11,50,000/- for
       purchasing the said vehicle after making a down payment of Rs.3,50,000/- to the
       company of the petitioners. Hence, it is submitted that the petitioners ought not
       be given the privileges of anticipatory bail.
</p><p id="p_10">              Considering the fact that there is no material in the record which is placed
       before this Court to suggest that the petitioners had any knowledge about the
       outstanding dues of the vehicle in question at the time of vehicle being sold to
       the complainant and the facts of the case, I am inclined to grant privileges of
       anticipatory bail to the petitioners. Accordingly, the petitioners are directed to
       surrender in the Court of learned Judicial Magistrate, Dhanbad within four
       weeks from today and in the event of their arrest or surrendering, the petitioners
       will be enlarged on bail on depositing a demand draft of Rs.50,000/- each as ad
       interim victim compensation without prejudice to their defence in this case
       drawn in favour of the complainant namely- Santosh Kumar and on furnishing
       bail bond of Rs.25,000/- (Twenty five thousand) each with two sureties of the
       like amount to the satisfaction of learned Judicial Magistrate, Dhanbad in
       connection with C.P. Case No.684 of 2015 subject to the conditions as laid down
       under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_3">Section 438(2)</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
</p><p id="p_11">              In case the petitioners deposit the said demand draft, the court below is
       directed to issue notice to the complainant namely- Santosh Kumar and on his
       proper identification, the court below shall handover the same to him forthwith.
