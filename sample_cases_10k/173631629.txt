       This criminal petition is filed under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_1">Section 482</a> of Cr.P.C.
praying to quash the complaint and FIR registered by
jurisdictional police in Cr.No.90/2016 dated 23.3.2016 for the
alleged offences punishable under <a href="/doc/390500/" id="a_2">Sections 141</a>, <a href="/doc/872363/" id="a_3">143</a>, <a href="/doc/1154131/" id="a_4">147</a>, <a href="/doc/770961/" id="a_5">323</a>,
<a href="/doc/267625/" id="a_6">324</a>, <a href="/doc/661069/" id="a_7">341</a>, <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_8">504</a>, <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_9">506</a>, <a href="/doc/378671/" id="a_10">447</a> r/w. 149 of <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_11">IPC</a> vide Annexures A and B
filed against these petitioners which is pending on the file of the
learned 44th A.C.M.M., Bangalore, etc.

     This petition, coming on for admission, this day, the Court
made the following:

                            ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">      Heard the learned Senior Advocate Sri T.R.Subbanna

appearing for the petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">      2. It is found that the petitioners are accused of having

trespassed on the land belonging to the employer of the

complainant and having assaulted and abused him in foul

language. It is pointed out by the learned Senior Advocate that

the case is false and foisted against the petitioner. The alleged

complainant is said to be the watchman of the brother-in-law of

the first petitioner and since there is a civil dispute raised by the

petitioner in so far as the brother-in-law seeks to claim the

property belonging to the first petitioner's husband who is no

more as having been bequeathed to him under a Will has foisted

a false claim and the criminal case is foisted on the petitioners

who are nowhere concerned with the dispute alleged. The other
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                  4</span>




petitioners have been arrayed only because they are on good

terms with petitioner No.1 and there was no such incident as

complained of. Hence the proceedings have resulted in a

miscarriage of justice and would have to be quashed.



</p><p id="p_4">       3. However, at this stage, the criminal case shall have to

run its course before the trial court and if there is a civil dispute

pending it would run on its course as well and there is no

warrant to quash the criminal proceedings, in the face of the

circumstances that there may be no case of trespass. If the land

does not belong to the employer of the complainant or

otherwise, the allegation of assault and abuse would not have

been made. The defence that is available to the petitioner are in

fact the grounds raised in the present petition which can very

well be urged at the trial or even at an earlier stage without

seeking discharge.      Consequently, the present petition is

disposed of without prejudice to the case of the petitioners.
