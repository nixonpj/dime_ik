</pre>

<p id="p_1">1.         It is an "old matter" which has travelled relatively a long
journey of about 12 years in the judicial system.
</p>

<p id="p_2">2.         By filing the present petition, the petitioner Smt. Prem Lata
Jain (petitioner no. 1), Sh. Kapil Jain (petitioner no.2) and Sh Ravi
Jain (petitioner no. 3 ) are seeking eviction of respondents, Sh.
O.P. Laul (respondent no. 1), Sh. Ajay Makkar (respondent no. 2)
and M/s International Rubber Industries (respondent no.3 ), in
respect of premises bearing no. 52/2C, Rama Road, Najafgarh
Road, New Delhi-15, as shown in red colour in the site plan
attached with the petition (hereinafter referred to as suit
premises) under Section 14(1)(a) and (b) of DRC Act for non-
payment of rent and subletting.
</p>

<p id="p_3">3.         The facts in brief, as narrated in the petition, are that
tenancy of suit premises is an old tenancy. The present rate of
rent is Rs. 1,000/- per month. The premises are non residential
and being used for industrial purpose. That respondent no. 3 is


E. No. 107/09/03.                    Prem Lata Jain &amp; Ors. Vs. O.P. Laul &amp; Ors.           Page  2  of 25   
 the partnership firm of respondent no. 1 &amp; 2.
</p><p id="p_4">           It is further claimed that respondents have neither tendered
nor paid rent to Sh. Shanti Prasad Jain since January 1993 and
after the demise of such Sh. Shanti Prasad Jain on 29/04/2001,
the       respondents have neither tendered nor                                      paid rent to the
present petitioners who are the legal heirs of late Sh. Shanti
Prasad Jain. It is further claimed that respondents have so failed
to pay the rent despite service of legal demand notice dated
07/03/2002 vide which arrears of rent were demanded and
tenancy was also terminated. It is further claimed that such legal
demand notice was sent to respondent no. 1 &amp; 2 through
registered AD and same was duly served on the respondents.
</p><p id="p_5">           It is further claimed by the petitioners that about two years
ago the respondents had inducted Sh. Harshwardhan Lal as
tenant into the tenanted suit premises. It is further claimed that
Sh. Harshwardhan Lal is running his independent business of
manufacturing typewriter rollers. As such it is claimed that
respondents have sublet, assigned and parted with the
possession of tenanted suit premises to such Sh. Harshwardhan
Lal without having written consent of the petitioners.
</p><p id="p_6">           As such the petitioner has filed present eviction petition U/s
14 (1) (a) &amp; (b) of DRC Act.
</p>

<p id="p_7">4.         In this case despite repeated opportunities given, the
respondent no. 2 failed to file any written statement. Therefore,
vide order dated 23/09/2004, defence of respondent no. 2 was
struck off. Further, on perusal of previous order sheets it is
revealed that respondent no. 2 did not contest the present
petition.
</p>


<p id="p_8">E. No. 107/09/03.                    Prem Lata Jain &amp; Ors. Vs. O.P. Laul &amp; Ors.             Page  3  of 25   
</p><p id="p_9"> 5.         But, respondent no. 1 &amp; 3 vehemently contested the
present petition. And they filed their W.S. dated 07/02/2004. In
such W.S. they denied the relationship of landlord and tenants
between the parties. But, it is admitted that the premises was let
out by Sh. Shanti Prasad Jain. It is further stated that such late
Sh. Shanti Prasad Jain along with his three brothers were the
owners of premises in which tenanted suit premises is situated. It
is further admitted that such Sh. Shanti Prasad Jain was
introduced as the landlord. And he was competent to receive and
realise his rent during his lifetime. In any case, it is claimed that
petitioners have not shown any order of succession or any other
proof by means of which they are claiming ownership or
landlordship of the tenanted suit premises.
</p><p id="p_10">           It is further claimed that the remaining three brothers of late
Sh. Shanti Prasad Jain are also necessary and proper parties to
the present petition.
</p><p id="p_11">           It is further claimed that present petition is bad for mis-
joinder of respondent no. 3 which is only a partnership firm of
respondent no. 1 &amp; 2.
</p><p id="p_12">           It is further claimed that in any case the alleged sub tenant
is not made a party, hence, present petition is liable to be
dismissed.
</p><p id="p_13">           On merit, the respondent no. 1 &amp; 3 did not deny the rate of
rent @ Rs. 1,000/- per month. It is further stated that respondents
are in possession of tenanted suit premises since 1981. It is
further admitted that respondent no. 3 is a partnership firm started
by respondent no. 1 &amp; 2. Further, non residential nature of
tenanted suit premises is also not disputed.
</p><p id="p_14">           But, it is denied that respondents have neither paid nor
tendered the rent since January 1993. It is submitted that

E. No. 107/09/03.                    Prem Lata Jain &amp; Ors. Vs. O.P. Laul &amp; Ors.      Page  4  of 25   
 respondents have paid the rent to late Sh. Shanti Prasad Jain
upto April 2001. It is further claimed that late Sh. Shanti Prasad
Jain promised to send the receipt for the same, but unfortunately,
he expired in the last week of April 2001.
</p><p id="p_15">           Further, receiving of legal demand notice dated 07/03/2002
is also denied.
</p><p id="p_16">           Further, it is claimed that respondent no. 1 &amp; 2 are in
occupation of tenanted suit premises and carrying on the
business in partnership with their family members. And it is
vehemently denied that respondents have sublet, assigned and
parted with the possession of tenanted suit premises to Sh.
Harshwardhan Lal.                         It     is      further         denied      that   such       Sh.
Harshwardhan Lal is running a manufacturing unit in his
individual capacity in the tenanted suit premises.
</p><p id="p_17">           It is further submitted in this regard that Sh. Harshwardhan
Lal is the son of respondent no. 1 and as a matter of fact he has
been the partner of respondents since 1985. And the said
partnership firm was duly registered with the Sales Tax
Department in the name and style of M/s Premier Rubber
Products. Shri Harshwardhan Lal is still partner of the respondent
no. 1. The respondents are admittedly still in the occupation,
actual and legal possession of the premises in question                                                  as
tenants thereof and there is no subletting of any sort in favour of
Sh. Harshwardhan Lal.
</p><p id="p_18">           It is further submitted by respondents that after taking the
tenanted suit premises on rent, the respondents no. 1 &amp; 2 started
the business under the name and style of M/s International
Rubber Industries, in partnership with Sh. Sudesh Kumar Laul
and Smt. Kanchan Makkar. In the year 1985, the respondent
no. 1 continued the business of such partnership under the name

E. No. 107/09/03.                    Prem Lata Jain &amp; Ors. Vs. O.P. Laul &amp; Ors.              Page  5  of 25   
 and style of Premier Rubber Products in partnership with Sh.
Sudesh Kumar Laul and his son Sh. Harshwardhan Laul. The
said partnership firm business is still continuing and respondent
no. 1 &amp; 2 are in physical and legal occupation of tenanted suit
premises.
</p>

<p id="p_19">6.      Thereafter, replication dated 06/04/2004 was filed by
petitioners. In the replication, the petitioner denied the stand
taken by the respondent no. 1 &amp; 3 and reiterated their original
stand taken in the petition. It is further clarified that petitioner
inherited the property by succession. It is further claimed that
such inheritance is in the knowledge of respondent no. 1 &amp; 3. It is
further stated that other tenants are paying rent to the petitioners.
</p><p id="p_20">           It is further stated that after partition among the four
brothers of late Sh. Shanti Prasad Jain, property no. 52/2 came to
the share of late Sh. Shanti Prasad Jain and the respondents
were inducted in the tenanted suit premises as tenants. As such it
is also stated that remaining three brothers of late Sh. Shanti
Prasad Jain are not necessary or proper to the present petition.
</p><p id="p_21">           Further, the petitioner denied that respondent no. 1 &amp; 2 are
the joint tenants. It is claimed that they are co-tenants.                                    It is
further stated that it is the respondent no. 3 with whom tenancy in
question was created and respondent no. 1 &amp; 2 were only the
partners of respondent no. 3 at that time.
</p><p id="p_22">           It is further denied that Sh. Harshwardhan Laul is a partner
of respondents since 1985 under the partnership in the name and
style of M/s Premier Rubber Products. It is further claimed that
such partnership, if any, is only a camouflage.
</p>

<p id="p_23">7.           In this case, arguments were heard U/s 15(1) of DRC Act

E. No. 107/09/03.                    Prem Lata Jain &amp; Ors. Vs. O.P. Laul &amp; Ors.      Page  6  of 25   
 and vide order dated 21/02/2005 passed by my Ld. Predecessor,

</p>

<p id="p_24">8.         Thereafter, evidence was led by both the parties. The
petitioner no. 2, Sh. Kapil Jain examined himself as the only
witness of petitioners as PW-1. He tendered his evidence by way
of affidavit Ex. P-1. PW-1 deposed on the lines of the stand taken

plan as Ex. PW-1/2;                             copy of legal demand notice dated

</p><p id="p_25">           Petitioner/PW-1 was cross examined at length by the
respondent no. 1 counsel.
</p>

<p id="p_26">9.         Although a long list of witnesses was given by respondents'
side, but ultimately respondent no. 1, Sh. O.P. Laul examined
himself as the RW-1 by way of affidavit, Ex. RW1/A. Further, Sh.
Harshwardhan Lal was examined as RW-2 by way of affidavit,
Ex. RW2/A. Both of them deposed on the lines of defence taken

Ld. Counsel for both side argued very well. Further, I have
perused the record.
</p>

<p id="p_29">11.        Before proceeding further it is pertinent to note that
respondents admitted that the tenanted suit premises was let out
by Sh. Shanti Prasad Jain. And the present petitioners are the
LRs of such original landlord late Sh. Shanti Prasad Jain. In any
case, it is not necessary that all the landlords must join in filing
the eviction petition of present nature, therefore, there is no force
in the objection of respondents side that 03 brothers of late Sh
Shanti Prasad Jain are not made parties in present petition,
particularly when admittedly the respondents were dealing and
accepted Sh. Shanti Prasad Jain as their landlord.
</p><p id="p_30">           Further, it is pertinent to note at this stage that a case of
civil nature is to be decided on the basis of preponderance of
probabilities.

<p id="p_33">I). Relationship As Landlord and Tenant:-
</p><p id="p_34">13.        In their pleadings, a stand is taken by the petitioners that it
is the respondent no. 3 firm with whom tenancy in question was
created and respondent no. 1 &amp; 2 were only the partners of

respondent no. 3 at that time. It is further stated that respondent
no. 1 &amp; 2 are co-tenants. On the other hand, the stand taken by
the respondent no. 1 &amp; 3 in their WS is that respondent no. 1 &amp; 2
are joint tenants and present petition is bad for mis-joinder of
respondent no. 3 which is only a partnership firm of respondent
no. 1 &amp; 2.
</p><p id="p_35">              But, there appears to be some inconsistency in the
evidence of petitioner no. 2/ PW-1, who is the only witness of
petitioner, as to whom the tenanted suit property was originally let
out. At the stage of evidence in this regard, it is deposed by
petitioner no. 2/ PW-1 (who is the only witness of petitioner) in
para no. 2 in his examination in chief by way of affidavit Ex. P-1
that respondent no. 1 was inducted as the tenant in the tenanted
suit premises and he was issued rent receipt for the same. But
during his cross examination he denied the suggestion that suit
property was not let out to respondent no. 3. But later during his
cross         examination                 PW-1           himself           produced   the      original
counterfoils of rent receipt issued in the name of respondent no. 3
regarding tenanted suit premises and the same are Ex. PW-1/R1
(colly).
</p><p id="p_36">           But in any case, on a bare reading of such counterfoils, Ex.
</p>
<p id="p_37">E. No. 107/09/03.                    Prem Lata Jain &amp; Ors. Vs. O.P. Laul &amp; Ors.             Page  9  of 25   
 PW-1/R1 (colly), it is clear that name of respondent no. 3/ M/s
International Rubber Industries is mentioned as tenant in the
same regarding the tenanted suit premises i.e. 52/2C.
</p><p id="p_38">           Further even, RW-1/ respondent no. 1 orally deposed in his
evidence by way of affidavit Ex. RW-1/A that tenanted suit
premises was let out originally to him alongwith respondent no. 2,
Sh. Ajay Makkar. It is further deposed in this regard that after
taking the tenanted suit premises on rent respondent no. 3
partnership firm was formed. But in his cross examination
respondent no. 1/ RW-1 claimed that first rent receipt was issued
in his favour by late Sh. Shanti Prasad Jain but he admitted that
at present he does not have such rent receipt. Thus same is not
placed on record.
</p><p id="p_39">           Further, on a bare reading of legal demand notice Ex.
PW-1/3, it is clear that in para no. 1 thereof it is stated on behalf
of petitioner that respondent no. 1 &amp; 2 were inducted as tenants
in the suit premises.
</p><p id="p_40">           Thus, on an over all reading of such evidence on record
including the stand taken by PW-1 as well as RW-1 in their
examination in chief, it is concluded that premises were let out
originally not to respondent no. 3 firm but to respondent no.1 &amp; 2.
And thereafter the respondent no. 1 along with respondent no. 2
formed the respondent no. 3 partnership firm and rent receipts
were issued in the name of such partnership firm.
</p>

<p id="p_41">II). Rate of Rent:
</p>

<p id="p_42">14.        The rate of rent of Rs. 1,000/- per month is not disputed
between the parties.
</p>


<p id="p_43">E. No. 107/09/03.                    Prem Lata Jain &amp; Ors. Vs. O.P. Laul &amp; Ors.      Page  10  of 25   
 IV).       That a valid legal demand notice was duly served upon
           the respondent:
</p>

<p id="p_44">15.          The court is required to decide whether the legal notice
dated 07/03/2002 Ex. PW-1/3 was served upon the respondent
no. 1 &amp; 2 or not, as it is the service of this notice that gives rise to
cause of action for filling of the present petition.
</p>

<p id="p_45">16.        The presumption of service as per <a href="/doc/731516/" id="a_1">Section 114</a> of the
Indian Evidence Act and <a href="/doc/1428703/" id="a_2">Section 27</a> of General Clauses Act is
applicable if the petitioner is able to prove on record that Legal
demand notice Ex. PW-1/3 was sent through registered post AD
and/ or U.P.C as per law.
</p>

<p id="p_46">17.        <a href="/doc/529907/" id="a_3">In K. Bhaskaran v. Sankaran Vaidhyan Balan, (SC</a>)
[1999 A.I.R. (SC) 3762 ]; it was observed by the Honourable
Apex Court that the principle incorporated in <a href="/doc/1312051/" id="a_4">Section 27</a> can
profitably be imported in a case where the sender has dispatched
the notice by post with the correct address written on it. Then it
can be deemed to have been served on the sendee unless he
proves that it was not really served and that he was not
responsible for such non-service. It was further observed that
when a notice is returned by the sendee as unclaimed, such date
would be the commencing date in reckoning relevant period.
</p>

<p id="p_47"> 18.       In the present petition, PW-1 deposed in his examination in
chief by way of affidavit that legal demand notice Ex. PW-1/3 was
sent to respondent no. 1 through registered post AD Ex. PW-1/4
and Ex. PW-1/5 as well as U.P. C Ex PW-1/9 at respondent no. 1
address at Shimla, Himachal Pradesh as well as at tenanted suit

 premises address. Same is also clear from the copy of legal
demand notice Ex. PW-1/3 and such postal receipts.
</p><p id="p_48">           RW-1/respondent no. 1 has denied the receiving of legal
demand notice Ex. PW-1/3. But he has not denied his residential
address i.e. 7, the mall, Shimla, Himachal Pradesh. But he stated
that he was residing at 7, the mall, Shimla upto year 1992. But at
the same time he admitted that his address in document Ex.
PW-1/9 (the U.P. C. receipt) is correct. Further, RW-1 gave
evasive answer what document he has to show for his residence
proof at CA apartment at Delhi. Further, he stated that he does
not remember whether he received the summons at Delhi or
Shimla. He further admitted the hotel Harsha at Shimla is looked
after by himself, his son and his wife. He further admitted the
address on AD card Ex. RW1/PX-2 is correctly mentioned of
hotel Harsha at Shimla. Further in his affidavit of evidence of Ex.
RW-1/A also the respondent no. 1 /RW-1 has given his address
of hotel Harsha, the Mall, Shimla and he further mentioned that
he is at present at Delhi.
</p><p id="p_49">           Further, the legal demand notice was also sent to the
respondent no. 1 at tenanted suit premises address. Although as
per evidence on record it is lying sealed for some years but the
petitioner discharged their duty to send the legal notice at such
address also.
</p><p id="p_50">           Further, apart from the Mall, Shimla address and tenanted
suit premises address nowhere the respondent no. 1 has
disclosed any other address which is his permanent address nor
respondent no. 1 has placed on record any material that he
intimated to the petitioner side regarding his change of residence
from Shimla to Delhi.
</p><p id="p_51">              Therefore, in view of above mentioned evidence and

E. No. 107/09/03.                    Prem Lata Jain &amp; Ors. Vs. O.P. Laul &amp; Ors.      Page  12  of 25   
 admissions of respondent no. 1 on record, the legal demand
notice in question Ex. PW-1/3 is deemed to be served on the
respondent no. 1


</p><p id="p_52">19.        Further, in the present case, the respondent no. 2 failed
contest the present petition. As per PW-1 legal demand notice
Ex. PW-1/3 was sent to respondent no. 3 through registered post
whose receipt are as Ex. PW -1/6 and PW-1/7 as well as U.P.C
Ex. PW-1/9 even the AD card with some signature regarding the
notice sent through registered post is received back and the same
is Ex. PW-1/8. Therefore, in view of evidence on record r/w
presumption of service as per <a href="/doc/731516/" id="a_5">Section 114</a> of the Indian Evidence
Act and <a href="/doc/1428703/" id="a_6">Section 27</a> of General Clauses Act respondent no. 2 is
also deemed to be served. And it is concluded that the petitioner
proved the service of legal demand notice Ex. PW-1/3 upon all
the three respondents.
</p><pre id="pre_4">III)       Arrears Of Rent:
                       And
V)         That despite service of the legal demand notice the
</pre><p id="p_53">           respondent has neither paid nor tendered the entire
           arrears of legally recoverable rent:
</p>

<p id="p_54">20.        The issue before the court is whether the respondent was
in arrears of rent on the date of legal demand notice dated
07/03/2002, Ex. PW-1/3.
</p>

<p id="p_55">21.        It is the case of the petitioner that the respondent had
defaulted in payment of rent.                             It is deposed by PW-1 that
respondents defaulted in payment of rent. Further, the
respondents have neither tendered nor paid rent to Late Sh.
Shanti Prasad Jain since January 1993 and after the demise of

E. No. 107/09/03.                    Prem Lata Jain &amp; Ors. Vs. O.P. Laul &amp; Ors.      Page  13  of 25   
 such Sh. Shanti Prasad Jain on 29/04/2001, the respondents
have neither tendered nor paid rent to the present petitioners
who are the legal heirs of late Sh. Shanti Prasad Jain. It is further
claimed that respondent has so failed to pay the rent despite
service of legal demand notice dated 07/03/2002 Ex PW-1/3, vide
which arrears of rent were demanded. As such it is claimed that
the respondent defaulted in payment of rent, despite the service
of legal notice dated Ex. PW-1/3.
</p>

<p id="p_56">22.        It is settled law that when the petitioner alleges non-
payment of rent under section 14(1)(a) of DRC Act, the onus lies
upon the respondents/tenants to prove that they have paid the
rent.
</p>

<p id="p_57">23.        It is held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in
"Karamchand                     Deojee             Sanghavi                Vs.       Tulshiram       Kalu
Kumawat", [1992(1) RCR 118] that in a case of eviction on
arrears of rent, the onus would always be on tenant to prove that
he has paid the rent.
</p>

<p id="p_58">24.        Thus, the onus was upon the respondent to prove that he
had made upto date payment of rent @ Rs. 1,000/- per month
and that there were no arrears of rent due against them at the
time of service of legal demand notice Ex. PW-1/3.
</p>

<p id="p_59">25.        The respondent can prove the said fact either through oral
or documentary evidence.
</p>

<p id="p_60">26.        At this stage, it would be fruitful to keep in mind the
relevant sections 26 to 29 of DRC Act regarding the scheme and

E. No. 107/09/03.                    Prem Lata Jain &amp; Ors. Vs. O.P. Laul &amp; Ors.             Page  14  of 25   
 procedure about payment of rent and issues connected therewith.
</p>

<p id="p_61">27.        Having regard to such sections of the DRC Act, we come to
the facts of present case.
</p>

<p id="p_62">28.        The best case of respondents                                     in this regard, as also
deposed by RW-1/ respondent no. 1 is that they have paid the
rent to late Sh. Shanti Prasad Jain upto April 2001. It is further
deposed by RW-1 that late Sh. Shanti Prasad Jain promised to
send the receipt for the same, but unfortunately he expired. But
PW-1 in his cross examination denied the suggestion that his
father received rent from the respondents upto April 2001. He
further denied the suggestion that respondents are not in arrears
of rent since 01/01/1993. Further, during his cross examination
RW-1 deposed that he does not remember when the last rent
receipt was issued by late Sh. Shanti Prasad Jain in his favour.
And he further admitted that he used to keep the record of rent
used to be paid by him, but further he admitted that he does not
have any rent receipt after the period of 1993.
</p>

<p id="p_63">29.        At this stage, another important issue in the facts and
circumstances of present case is that whether the respondents
were legally required to move the court under <a href="/doc/679372/" id="a_7">Delhi Rent Control
Act</a>, if the petitioner refused to issue receipt.
</p>

<p id="p_64">30.        For this purpose, reliance can be placed on judgment of the
Honorable Supreme Court in judgment titled "Sarla Goel Vs
Kishan Chand" [2009 (7) SCC 658], where it was held that
where the landlord does not accept any rent tendered by the
tenant within the time referred to in <a href="/doc/387768/" id="a_8">Section 26</a> or refuses or

E. No. 107/09/03.                    Prem Lata Jain &amp; Ors. Vs. O.P. Laul &amp; Ors.          Page  15  of 25   
 neglects to deliver a receipt referred to therein or where there is a
bona fide doubt as the person or persons to whom the rent is
payable, the tenant may deposit such rent with the Controller in
the prescribed manner. When the words 'bona fide doubt' has
been added to <a href="/doc/1312051/" id="a_9">Section 27</a>, the tenant may remit such rent to the
Controller by postal money order. It was further held that from a
conjoint reading of this provision and particularly <a href="/doc/1312051/" id="a_10">Section 27</a> of the
Act, it cannot be doubted that the procedure having been made
by the Legislature how the rent can be deposited if it was refused
to have been received or to grant receipt for the same. If that be
the position, if such protection has been given to the tenant, the
said procedure has to be strictly followed in the matter of taking
steps in the event of refusal of the landlord to receive the rent or
to grant receipt to the tenant.
</p>

<p id="p_65">31.        It was further held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court that
taking into consideration the object of the Act and the intention of
the Legislature and in view of the discussions made herein
earlier, the word 'may' occurring in <a href="/doc/1312051/" id="a_11">Section 27</a> of the Act must be
construed as a mandatory provision and not a directory provision
as the word 'may', in their, was used by the Legislature to mean
that the procedure given in those provisions must be strictly
followed as the special protection has been given to the tenant
from eviction. Such a cannon of construction is certainly
warranted because otherwise intention of the Legislature would
be defeated and the class of landlords, for whom also, the
beneficial provisions have been made for recovery of possession
from the tenants on certain grounds, will stand deprived of them.
</p>

<p id="p_66">32.        From the aforesaid judgment it is clear that for the sake of

E. No. 107/09/03.                    Prem Lata Jain &amp; Ors. Vs. O.P. Laul &amp; Ors.      Page  16  of 25   
 arguments, even if, the stand of the respondent is presumed to be
true that the landlord refuses to issue rent receipt, still the
respondents failed in their obligation to move appropriate
application in court under <a href="/doc/1557153/" id="a_12">section 27</a> of Delhi Rent Control Act.
Therefore, he cannot claim that he is protected from eviction
under <a href="/doc/367290/" id="a_13">section 14(1)(a)</a> of Delhi Rent Control Act, in view of such
settled position of law.
</p>

<p id="p_67">33.        Further in any case, there is not even any oral testimony
from the respondents side regarding payment of rent after April
2001. In fact, during his cross examination, RW-1 admitted that
he never paid rent to the LRs of late Sh Shanti Prasad Jain. But
he tried to explain that he did not pay the rent since all his three
brothers as well as LRs of late Sh. Shanti Prasad Jain started
demanding the rent. He further admitted that he did not even
deposit the rent in court before passing of order U/s 15 (1) of
DRC Act in present petition.
</p>

<p id="p_68">34.          But again such explanation of respondent no. 1 /RW-1
appears to be an after thought. As per proviso to sub section (I)
to section 27 of DRC Act, in case there is any bonafide doubt as
to the person or persons to whom rent is payable, the tenant may
remit such rent to the controller by postal money order.
Admittedly respondent side did not even deposit the rent in court
before passing of order U/s 15 (1) of DRC Act in present petition,
Therefore, even if such stand of respondent side (that all three
brothers as well as LRs of late Sh. Shanti Prasad Jain started
demanding the rent) is presumed to be true, still the respondents'
side failed to comply with such legal requirement of remitting the
rent to court after the death of late Sh. Shanti Prasad Jain in April

E. No. 107/09/03.                    Prem Lata Jain &amp; Ors. Vs. O.P. Laul &amp; Ors.      Page  17  of 25   
 2001 till legal demand notice dated 07/03/2002.
</p>

<p id="p_69">35.          In view of the above discussion, the court is of the opinion
that despite the service of the legal demand notice, the
respondents have neither paid nor tendered the entire arrears of
legally recoverable rent for the last three years.
</p>

<p id="p_70">    Conclusion for Section 14(1)(a) D.R.C. Act:
</p><p id="p_71">36.        From the above said discussion, it is clear that the
petitioners have proved all the ingredients of Section 14(1)(a) of
DRC Act and, therefore, the present petition is decided in favour
of the petitioner and against the respondent with respect of
tenanted suit premises i.e. premises bearing no. 52/2C, Rama
Road, New Delhi-15, as shown in red colour in the site plan
Ex.PW1/2.
</p>

<p id="p_72">37.        In the foregoing circumstances, the respondents are held to
be a defaulter within the meaning of Section 14(1)(a) of DRC Act.
</p>

<p id="p_73">38.        Order under Section 15(1) DRC has already passed in this
case. As such, separate file be maintained for consideration as

regards benefit under section 14(2) DRC Act and put up on
07/08/2015 for such purpose.
</p>

<p id="p_74">                              <a href="/doc/367290/" id="a_14">Section 14</a> (1) (b) DRC Act
</p><p id="p_75">39.        To decide a petition U/s 14 (1) (b) DRC Act, it is to be
proved by the petitioner:
</p><p id="p_76">i) that alleged sub tenant is in exclusive possession,
</p><p id="p_77">ii) that there is relationship of lesser and lessee between the

E. No. 107/09/03.                    Prem Lata Jain &amp; Ors. Vs. O.P. Laul &amp; Ors.      Page  18  of 25   
 tenant and alleged sub-tenant.
</p>

<p id="p_78">40.        Before proceeding further it is pertinent to note that there is
no necessity to implead the alleged sub tenant in present petition,
as otherwise claimed by the respondents' side.
</p>

<p id="p_79">41.        Further, it has been held in "M/s Mahender Saree
Emporium Vs. G.V. Srinivasa Murthy", [2004 (2) RCR 286]
that the onus of proving sub-letting is on landlord and onus will
stand discharged if landlord proves that alleged sub-tenant was in
exclusive possession of premises or was holding or right to enjoy
the premises. A presumption of sub-letting may then be raised
and would amount to proof unless rebutted. It has been further
held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in "Bharat Sales
Limited Vs. Life Insurance Corporation of India", [1998 II AD
(SC) 220] that it would be difficult for the landlord to prove, by
direct evidence, the contract or agreement or understanding
between the tenant and the sub-tenant. It would also be difficult
for the landlord to prove, by direct evidence, that the person to
whom the property had been sublet had paid monetary
consideration to the tenant. Payment of rent, undoubtedly, is an
essential element of lease or sub-lease. It may be paid in cash or
any kind or may have been paid or promised to be paid. It may
have been paid in lump-sum in advance covering the period for
which the premises is let out or sublet or it may have been paid or
promised to be paid periodically. Since payment of rent or
monetary consideration may have been made secretly the law
does not require such payment to be proved by affirmative
evidence and the court is permitted to draw its own inference
upon the facts of the case proved at the trial, including the

E. No. 107/09/03.                    Prem Lata Jain &amp; Ors. Vs. O.P. Laul &amp; Ors.      Page  19  of 25   
 delivery of exclusive possession to infer that the premises were
sublet.
</p>

<p id="p_80">42.        In the light of above mentioned position of law on <a href="/doc/367290/" id="a_15">section
14</a> (1) (b) of DRC Act, we come back to the facts of present case.
</p>

<p id="p_81">43.        Deposing on the lines of main eviction petition, the
petitioner no. 2/PW-1 deposed in his examination in chief by way
of affidavit that respondents inducted Sh. Harshwardhan Lal into
the tenanted suit premises as tenant. It is further deposed that
Sh. Harshwardhan Lal is running his independent business of
manufacturing typewriter rollers. It is further deposed that
respondent no. 1 is not carrying any business in the tenanted suit
premises. It is further deposed that neither respondent no.1 nor
respondent no. 2 is carrying the business of respondent no. 3
firm. It is further deposed that partnership pleaded by the
respondent with Sh. Harshwardhan Lal is a camouflage. As such
it is claimed that respondents have sublet, assigned and parted
with the possession of tenanted suit premises to such Sh.
Harshwardhan Lal without having written consent of the
petitioners.
</p>

<p id="p_82">44.          On the other hand, respondent no. 1 has deposed that
after taking the tenanted suit premises on rent, respondent no. 3
partnership firm was formed along with two other partners. Same
continued upto 31/03/1985. And respondent no. 2 and another
partner Kanchan Makkar ceased to be partner of such firm.
</p><p id="p_83">           It is further deposed that respondent no. 1/ RW-1 and his
brother S.K. Laul has taken the adjoining premises no. 52/2D, in
the same year of 1981. And in the said premises a partnership

E. No. 107/09/03.                    Prem Lata Jain &amp; Ors. Vs. O.P. Laul &amp; Ors.      Page  20  of 25   
 firm by the name of "Premier Rubber Products" was formed with
respondent no. 1 &amp; 2 along with same two other partners. Same
also continued 1985. And respondent no. 2 and another partner
Kanchan Makkar ceased to be partner of such firm.
</p><p id="p_84">           It is further deposed by RW-1 that in the year 1985, RW-1
introduced his son Mr. Harshwardhan Laul as a partner in the
partnership firm "Premier Rubber Products". As such there were
three partners in such firm i.e the respondent no. 1, his brother S.
K. Laul and his son Harshwardhan Laul. It is further deposed by
RW-1 that such firm continued to run business of tenanted suit
premises bearing no. 52/2C as well as adjoining premises
bearing no. 52/2D.
</p><p id="p_85">           It is further deposed that in the year 1994 Sh. S.K. Laul,
brother of Respondent no. 1/ RW-1 also ceased to be a partner.
And it is further deposed that as such respondent no. 1/ RW-1
along with his son Harshwardhan Laul continued as partner in the
firm M/s "Premier Rubber Products" carrying business from both
the premises i.e. tenanted suit premises bearing no. 52/2C as
well as adjoining premises bearing no. 52/2D.
</p><p id="p_86">           Further, the RW-1/ respondent no. 1 proved such various
partnership deed and other related documents relating to the
affairs of such two such partnership firm as Ex. RW-1/1 to Ex.
RW-1/27.
</p>

<p id="p_87">45.          The RW-2, Sh. Harshwardhan Laul deposed on the lines
of the RW-1. It is pertinent to note that he is the person who is the
alleged sub tenant as per the petitioner's case.
</p>

<p id="p_88">46.           It is further pertinent to note that presence of Sh.
Harshwardhan Laul in the suit premises is not denied. But it is

E. No. 107/09/03.                    Prem Lata Jain &amp; Ors. Vs. O.P. Laul &amp; Ors.      Page  21  of 25   
 claimed by the respondents that atmost he is a partner of the
partnership firm constituted by the respondent no. 1 and in that
capacity not only such Harshwardhan Laul but also respondent
no. 1 himself are showing their presence in the tenanted suit
premises as well as the adjoining premises.
</p><p id="p_89">           But, in his cross examination RW-1 as well as RW-2
deposed that tenanted suit premises is lying locked since 2007.
Further, during his cross examination PW-1 stated that he does
not know well Sh. Harshwardhan Laul is a partner in M/s Premier
Rubber Products since 1985 along with respondent no. 1.
</p>

<p id="p_90">47.          But further in any case, during his cross examination the
PW-1, who is the only witness of petitioner side, stated that at
present premises in possession of respondent no. 3 firm, of which
respondent no. 1 is a partner. PW-1 further deposed that he does
not know whether some other partners joined respondent no. 3
firm and subsequently they got retired from respondent no. 3 firm.
Further, PW-1 admitted that he lastly visited that premises in the
year 2011. He further admitted that there was no signboard on
the shade when he last visited the premises and only workers
were working in the premises. He further admitted that none of
the owners met him although he visited the tenanted suit
premises two/three times.
</p>

<p id="p_91">48.        Therefore, it is clear that although it is the case of
petitioners that such Sh. Harshwardhan Laul is in exclusive
possession of tenanted suit premises, but the petitioner side
failed to place on record any documentary or even any convincing
oral evidence in support of their such stand. In fact, as is clear
from the cross examination of PW-1, he never saw Sh.
</p>
<p id="p_92">E. No. 107/09/03.                    Prem Lata Jain &amp; Ors. Vs. O.P. Laul &amp; Ors.      Page  22  of 25   
 Harshwardhan Laul physically present in the tenanted suit
premises. Further, at best respondent no. 1/ RW-1 and RW-2
have deposed categorically that Harshwardhan Laul/ RW-2 is a
partner in the partnership firm M/s Premier Rubber Products. And
their stand is even supported by documentary evidence. Further,
apart from vague and bald allegations, the petitioner side has
failed to lead any evidence to assail the authenticity of such
documents.
</p>

<p id="p_93">49.        But it is also important to note at this stage that the DRC
Act does not prevent a tenant, who has taken business premises
on rent, from taking partners and carrying on a partnership
business. The restriction is against sub-letting, assignment or
parting with possession and there is no restriction against a
tenant allowing the use of the premises to his partners for
carrying on the business.
</p>

<p id="p_94">50.        It is also important to note that unless the possession of
other parties is exclusive in the sense that he is entitled to
exclude the tenant from possession, it can not be said that the
tenant has parted with legal possession of the premises in favour
of the partner.
</p>

<p id="p_95">51.        It is also important to note if the tenant enters into
partnership with the alleged sub-tenant and the partnership deed
is held to be genuine, as is in present case, then there would be
no sub-letting.
</p>

<p id="p_96">52.        It is held that if the respondent no-1/tenant takes with him
one or two more partners and carries on a joint business in the

E. No. 107/09/03.                    Prem Lata Jain &amp; Ors. Vs. O.P. Laul &amp; Ors.      Page  23  of 25   
 premises, which he had taken on rent, that would not afford a
ground to the landlord for eviction. It is only if it is established
that he has nothing to do with the partnership business and has
completely given over the possession of the premises to other
partners that sub-letting can be inferred, but petitioners failed to
establish the same in present petition.
</p>

<p id="p_97">53.        In fact a third person, by entering into partnership with a
tenant, does not become a tenant in the tenanted premises. The
original tenant after the agreement of partnership, shall be
deemed to be in possession of such premises. No rights in
tenancy vest in the persons, who are taken as partners by the
tenant. A firm name is only a compendious way of describing the
partners of the firm, therefore,                                 occupation by a firm is only
occupation by its partners. Therefore, as in the present case even
after change in the partners, the old and new firms had the same
respondent no-1 as a common partner, the occupation would be
by one of the original tenant/respondent no-1, and the common
partner would be considered to be in possession all through in his
individual capacity.
</p>

<p id="p_98">54.        Further in present case, it is already held above that
premises was originally let out to respondent no. 1 who later
formed respondent no. 3 partnership firm alongwith some other
partners. Further, it is proved on record that during the same time
another partnership firm M/s Premier Rubber products was
formed. Further, it is concluded on the basis of evidence on
record that in any case respondent no-1 is still in the physical and
legal possession of tenanted suit property. Further, in view of
such position of law as discussed above if a tenant subsequently

 forms a partnership firm and introduce some new partnership firm
i.e. Mr. Harshwardhan Laul in present case, for carrying out the
business from the tenanted suit premises the same does not
amount to sub-letting within the meaning of <a href="/doc/367290/" id="a_16">section 14</a> (1) (b) of
D.R.C. Act.
</p>

<p id="p_99">55.          Furthermore in any case, the petitioner side failed to lead
any evidence even to draw any inference that there is relationship
of lesser and lessee between the respondent and alleged sub-
tenant, Mr. Harshwardhan Laul.
</p>

<p id="p_100">56.        Under these facts and circumstances, it is held that the
petitioners failed to prove the ingredients of section 14(1)(b) of
DRC Act. As such eviction order can not passed in favour of
petitioner and against the respondent as far as U/s 14 (1) (b)
DRC Act is concerned.
