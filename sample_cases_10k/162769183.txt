certificates in-respect of land bearing Sy.No. 46/4

<p id="p_16">        .13.   Ex.P.28 to 35 are certified copies of final

decree passed in O.S. 8624/2017 by the 37 th Addl. City

Civil and Sessions Judge at Bengaluru city (CCH-38). It

reveals that the plaintiffs 1 to 6 filed the suit against

the defendants 1 and 2. The plaintiffs in the said case

are claimants 17, 12, 13, 16, 18 and 14 respectively in

the present case. The defendants 1 and 2 in the said

case are claimant No.7 and 15 of the present case. The

said case ended with compromise on 23.01.2018. As

per the compromise decree, 2 guntas of land fell to the

share of claimant No.7 and 3 guntas of land each fell to

the share of claimant No.11 to 18.

<p id="p_17">        .14.     I   have   carefully     perused   the   claim

statements, oral evidence of PW.1 to 9 and documentary
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                            12</span>
                                                  L.A.C. No.91/2012
evidence placed by the claimant No.7, 11 to 18.            The

claimant No.2 to 5, 8 to 10 have not appeared and

resisted the case of claimant No.7, 11 to 18. I am of the

opinion that, in the cross-examination of PW.s 1 to 9,

nothing has been elicited by the respondent's side. I am

of the opinion that case of the claimant No.7, 11 to 18

is supported by oral and documentary evidence. Hence,

I come to the conclusion that, originally bearing

Sy.No.46/4 measuring 23 guntas out of 37 guntas,

situated   at   Gidadakonenahalli    village,    belongs    to

Madaiah.    As    per   compromise      decree     in   O.S.

No.8624/2017, legal heirs of Madaiah divided their

share in the above said 23 guntas of land. As per

compromise decree, 2 guntas of land fell to the share of

claimant No.7 and 3 guntas of land each fell to the

share of claimant No.11 to 18. Actually the respondent

No.1 has acquired the land measuring 37 guntas in

Sy.No.46/4 of Gidadakonenahalli village and awarded

total compensation of Rs.8,28,834/-. Out of the same,

the claimant No.7, 11 to 18 are claiming 23 guntas.

They claiming compensation as per the compromise

decree passed in O.S. No.8624/2017.         I come to the

conclusion   that,     out   of   said   compensation     of

Rs.8,28,834/-,   the    claimant    No.7   is   entitle   for

compensation amount in-respect of 2 guntas of land

with accrued interest. The claimant No.11 to 18 are

entitle for the compensation in-respect of 3 guntas of

land each with accrued interest. Further I come to the

conclusion that, the claimant No1 to 5, 8 to 10 are not

present and proved their title over the acquired

property. Though the claimant No.6 has appeared

through her counsel, she has not filed claim statement

and proved her title over the acquired property. Hence,

the claimants 1 to 6, 8 to 10 are not entitle for

compensation with accrued interest. Therefore, I come

to the conclusion that, the reference in-respect of

claimant No.1 to 6, 8 to 10 is liable to be rejected. The

reference in-respect of claimant No.7, 11 to 18 is liable

to be allowed. Therefore, I answer the point No.1 and 2

in the affirmative and point No.3 in the negative.
