  Criminal revision petition under <a href="/doc/1457888/" id="a_1">section 397</a> Cr.PC against the
order dated 22.09.2015 passed by Ld. MM­01, South­East, Saket,

            ltd. Vs. Joint Trading Services ltd &amp; ors. 

ORDER
</pre>


<p id="p_1">1.     The dispute between the parties pertains to dishonouring of two
       cheques   both   dated   26.08.2014   worth   Rs.15,00,000/­   and
       Rs.20,00,000/­ respectively. These two cheques were issued by
       Joint Trading Services Limited (accused company)  through its
       two Directors (revisionists herein) in favour of respondent no.2
       M/S   Monnet   Ispat   &amp;   Energy   Limited   (complainant)   towards
       payment of the balance loan amount. Upon presentation, these
       cheques   were   returned   unpaid   because   of   insufficient   funds.
       Despite   service   of   legal   notice   dated   06.12.2014,   the
       revisionists­accused   did   not   pay   the   cheque   amount   to   the
       respondent   no.2­complainant.   Hence,   the   complaint   case   u/s
       138 <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_2">N.I Act</a>. 
</p><p id="p_2">2.     During   the   course   of   trial,   matter   was   also   referred   to   Lok
       Adalat for settlement. However, talks of settlement failed. On
       22.09.2015, Notice u/s 251 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_3">Cr.PC</a> was framed. The accused­
       company through revisionist no.1 Rajeev Rai as well as both
       the   revisionists­accused   pleaded   guilty.   The   case   was
       accordingly  listed for arguments on order on sentence. 
</p>
<p id="p_3">CR No.57/15                   13.01.2016                              Page no. 2/7
</p><p id="p_4"> 3.     The impugned order dated 22.09.2015 has been challenged on
       various grounds. 
</p><p id="p_5">4.     It   is   alleged   that   when   the   revisionists   appeared   before   the
       Court   on   22.09.2015,   they   were   asked   to   plead   guilty.   It   is
       further averred that Ld. Trial Court did not explain the meaning
       and consequences of the term 'plea of guilt' to the revisionists.
       Being   laymen,   the   revisionists­accused   could   not   understand
       the   technicalities   of   this   term   and   were   not   aware   of   its
       consequences.   It   is   alleged   that   the   cheques   issued   by   the
       revisionists­accused   were   security   cheques   which   do   not   fall
       within   the   ambit   <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_4">section   138</a>   of   the   Negotiable   Instruments
       Act,1881. It is further alleged that Ld. Trial Court acted in haste
       and,   therefore,   conviction   of   the   revisionists   is   erroneous   in
       law. Revisionists have prayed for setting aside the impugned
       order and for allowing them to claim trial. 
</p><p id="p_6">5.     Respondent­complainant has vehemently opposed the revision
       petition. Ld. Counsel for the complainant has also pointed out
       that   the   revisionists   have   deliberately   not   filed   the   detailed
       order dated 22.09.2015 as well as the notices framed u/s 251
       <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_5">Cr.PC</a> alongwith the revision petition and only the ordersheet
       dated 22.09.2015 has been filed to mislead the Court.
</p><p id="p_7">6.     I have heard the rival contentions and have perused the record
       carefully including the trial court record. 
</p><p id="p_8">7.     Perusal of the trial court record shows that on 22.09.2015, the

CR No.57/15                   13.01.2016                              Page no. 3/7
        revisionists­accused were present in the Court alongwith their
       counsel. Notice u/s 251 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_6">Cr.PC</a> was framed against the accused
       persons and the counsel for accused persons who was present in
       the   Court   submitted   that   accused   no.2   would   represent   the
       accused   no.1­company   i.e   Joint   Trading   Services   Ltd.   It   is,
       therefore, amply clear that the accused persons had active legal
       assistance when the notices u/s 251 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_7">Cr.PC</a> were framed against
       them. 
</p><p id="p_9">8.     Notices u/s 251 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_8">Cr.PC</a> framed against the accused­company and
       revisionists show that the notices were read over and explained
       to them and they were asked whether they pleaded guilty or
       claimed trial. When the accused persons pleaded guilty, they
       were asked if they pleaded guilty voluntarily. In answer to this
       question, the accused persons stated as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">              "Accused   company   took   a   loan   of   Rs.1.50
              crores   from   the   complainant   company   and
              returned Rs.1.15 crores. We could not honor
              the cheque due to financial crunch. We are
              ready   to   pay   the   cheque   amount   to   the
              complainant   company   if   some   time   be
              granted.   I   plead   guilty   without   any   threat,
              fear and coercion".
</blockquote>

<p id="p_10">9.     It is apparent that all the essential ingredients of the offence
       were   put   to   the   accused­revisionists.   They   admitted   their
       liability   and   pleaded   guilty   after   citing   the   circumstances
       because of which they were not able to honour the cheques.
</p>
<pre id="pre_2">CR No.57/15                  13.01.2016                             Page no. 4/7
        There   is   not   even   an   iota   of     defence   that   the   cheques   in
</pre><p id="p_11">       question were issued as security for loan. 
</p><p id="p_12">10.     Ld. Counsel for the revisionists has argued that on 22.09.2015,
       the counsel for the revisionists­accused had left the Court after
       requesting for referring the matter to mediation center. There is
       no   such   averment   on   record.   The   complainant   was   also   not
       present during the proceedings on 22.09.2015 before the trial
       court. Without the consent of the complainant, the matter could
       not have been referred to mediation.   It is also noted that this
       oral   submission   finds   no   mention   in   the   revision   petition.
       Besides,   there   is   no   reason   to   disbelieve   the   proceedings
       recorded by Ld. Trial Court in the ordersheet dated 22.09.2015.
       Ld. Counsel for the respondent­company has aptly relied upon
       State   of   Maharashtra   Vs.   Ramdas   Shrinivas   Nayak   and
       Another, (1982) 2 Supreme Court Cases 463  wherein it has
       been held by Hon'ble Supreme Court of India ­

               "Matters   of   judicial   record   are
               unquestionable.   They   are   not   open   to
               doubt. Judges cannot be dragged into the
               arena.   "Judgments   cannot   be   treated   as
               mere counters in the game of litigation."
</p><p id="p_13">               We are bound to accept the statement of
               the judges recorded in their judgment, as
               to   what   transpired   in   court.   We   cannot
               allow   the   statement   of   the   judges   to   be
               contradicted by statements at the Bar or by
               affidavit and other evidence. If the judges


CR No.57/15                    13.01.2016                              Page no. 5/7
               say in their judgment that something was
              done,   said   or   admitted  before   them,  that
              has to be the last word on the subject. The
              principle is well­settled that statements of
              fact as to what transpired at the hearing,
              recorded in the judgment of the court, are
              conclusive   of   the   facts   so   stated   and   no
              one   can   contradict   such   statements   by
              affidavit   or   other   evidence.   If   a   party
              thinks   that   the  happenings   in   court   have
              been wrongly recorded in a judgment, it is
              incumbent upon the party, while the matter
              is still fresh in the minds of the judges, to
              call the attention of the very judges who
              have made the record to the fact that the
              statement made with regard to his conduct
              was   a   statement   that   had   been   made   in
              error.   That   is   the   only   way   to   have   the
              record corrected. If no such step is taken,
              the matter must necessarily end there".

        present   case.     The   revisionists   have   failed   in   their   effort   to
       project that it was at the instance of the Court that they pleaded
       guilty in absence of their counsel. 
</p><p id="p_16">12.    In view of the above discussion, the Court is convinced that the
       essential ingredients of the offence u/s 138 <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_9">N.I Act</a> were read
       over and explained to the revisionists­accused who had active
       legal   assistance   available   to   them   and   they   pleaded   guilty
       voluntarily   without   any   threat   or   coercion.     In   these
       circumstances,   the   Court   does   not   find   any   infirmity   in   the
       impugned   order   vide   which   accused­revisionists   were
       convicted. The revision petition is, therefore, dismissed.
