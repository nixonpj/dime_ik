counsel for the petitioner.
         Shri R. K. Soni, Government Advocate for the respondents No.1 and 3/</pre>
<p id="p_1">State.
</p><p id="p_2">         This petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_2">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India has been filed
seeking direction to the State of Maharashtra and Secretary, State Transport
Authority (in short ''STA''), Bandra, Mumbai (Maharashtra) to countersign the
temporary permit granted to the petitioner by the State Transport Authority,
Gwalior in the light of the reciprocal transport agreement, executed between the
State of Madhya Pradesh and State of Maharashtra on 01/03/2007.
</p><p id="p_3">         It is submitted by the counsel for the petitioner that temporary permit has
been granted to the petitioner on Indore to Pune (Inter-State) route valid from
09/02/2019 to 31/05/2019 by Vehicle No.MP07-P-1169 subject to counter-
signature of the STA, Maharashtra. Accordingly, letters of recommendation
were sent to the STA, Maharashtra, however, in spite of deposit of the requisite
fee, the STA, Maharashtra has not countersigned the permit.
</p><p id="p_4">         The following reliefs have been sought :-
</p><p id="p_5">         ''7 (i) That, the respondent no. 2 &amp; 4 be directed, to henceforth
         countersign the permit granted to the petitioner, vide order dt.08-02-
         2019, passed by S. T. A. of M.P., without any delay.
</p><p id="p_6">         (ii) That, the respondent No.1 &amp; 3 may kindly be directed to
         ensure the implementation/give effect the agreement strictly.
</p><p id="p_7">         (iii) That,the other relief doing justice, including cost be awarded.''

         This Court by order dated 30/10/2018 passed in the case of Smt. Reena
Chachda vs. State of MP &amp; Ors. (Writ Petition No. 25132/2018) has held
that although the Gwalior Bench of High Court of Madhya Pradesh has
jurisdiction to entertain the writ petition because the Office of STA, Madhya
Pradesh is situated at Gwalior, but since the petitioner is seeking a direction for
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                              2</span>

      the STA, Maharashtra, therefore, considering the principle of ''Forum
      Conveniens'' this Court does not want to exercise its jurisdiction on the ground
      that a part of cause of action has arisen within the territorial jurisdiction of this
      Court and has dismissed the petition with liberty to the petitioner therein to
      approach the High Court of Mumbai for direction to the STA, Maharashtra.
</p><p id="p_8">            Since the present petition is squarely covered by the order passed by this
      Court in Writ Petition No.25132/2018, accordingly, this petition is disposed of
      with the following directions:-
</p><p id="p_9">            Under the facts and circumstances of the case, where the petitioner is
      seeking direction against the STA, Maharashtra to counter-sign the temporary
      permit and the Office of STA, Maharashtra is situated with the territorial
      jurisdiction of State of Maharashtra and a part of cause of action has also arisen
      within the State of Maharashtra, therefore, this Court does not find it
      appropriate to exercise its power under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_3">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India
      for directing the STA, Maharashtra to counter-sign the temporary permit issued
      by the STA, Madhya Pradesh.
</p><p id="p_10">            Thus, this petition is dismissed on the ground of Forum Conveniens,
      with liberty to the petitioner to approach the High Court of Mumbai, for
      redressal of her grievance.
