retired from service on attaining the age of superannuation on 31.03.2014,

on which date the petitioner was working on regular basis but the services

which the petitioner had rendered on part time basis from 01.07.1985 till

01.05.2012 has not been taken into account as qualifying service for

computing the pensionary benefits which act of the respondent is contrary to

the settled principle of law settled by this Court in CWP No.626 of 2015

titled as "<a href="/doc/140649233/" id="a_1">Zile Singh vs State of Haryana and others</a>", decided on

17.03.2015.
