                        In Re: Gobinda Charan Das
                                               .. Petitioner.
</p>

<p id="p_2">                        Mr. Aniruddha Chatterjee,
                        Mr. Surya Prasad Chatterjee
                                          .. For the Petitioner.

</p>

<p id="p_4">                        Affidavit of service filed in court today be kept with the record.
                        Heard the learned advocates for both the sides.
                        This application is at the instance of the plaintiff and is directed
          against the order no. 55 dated 11th April, 2013 passed by the learned Judge, 6th
          Bench, Presidency Small Causes Court, Calcutta in Ejectment Suit No. 23 of
          2005 thereby rejecting an application for amendment of the plaint at the stage of
          argument.
</p><p id="p_5">                        Upon hearing the learned advocates for both the sides and on going
          through the materials on record, I find that the plaintiff/petitioner herein
          instituted the aforesaid suit for ejectment on the ground of reasonable
          requirement and other consequential reliefs. The defendant/opposite party is
          contesting the said suit. Both the sides had adduced evidence in respect of their
          contentions against each other and the suit was at the stage of hearing the
          argument. At that stage, the application for amendment of the plaint was filed
          and said application was rejected by the impugned order.
</p><p id="p_6">                        The application for amendment has been annexed to the application
          as Annexure "C" at page 28 and the schedule of the amendment has been
          described at page 30 of the application. Upon perusal of the same, it appears that
          so far as the amendment is concerned, it is nothing but a typographical mistake.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                               2</span>


<p id="p_7">If the said amendment is allowed, there will be no change of the nature and
character of the suit. The question of prejudice on the part of the opposite party
does not arise in view of the fact that the opposite party got notice of ejectment in
respect of which amendment has been sought for.
</p><p id="p_8">            The learned Trial Judge has rejected the application on the ground
that the petitioner has failed to explain that in spite of due diligence the
defendant prayed for amendment of the plaint at the earlier stage, i. e., with
regard to the proviso to Order 6 Rule 17 of the Code of Civil Procedure. But in
consideration of the amendment as sought for, I am of the view that it is nothing
but for correction of the typographical mistake that has taken place at the time of
preparation of the plaint. Accordingly, such typographical mistake can be
corrected at any time.
</p><p id="p_9">            In that view of the matter, I am of the opinion that the learned Trial
Judge has committed illegality and material irregularity in rejecting the said
application for amendment of plaint. The impugned order cannot be sustained.
</p><p id="p_10">            Accordingly, this application is allowed and the impugned order is
hereby set aside.
</p><p id="p_11">            The application for amendment of the plaint appearing as Annexure
"C" at page 28 stands allowed. The learned Trial Judge is directed to proceed
with the suit from that stage.
</p><p id="p_12">            There will be no order as to costs.
</p><p id="p_13">            Urgent photostat certified copy of the order, if applied for, be
supplied to the learned advocates for the both the parties as early as possible.
