           (SMT. VIJAY PUROHIT Vs THE STATE OF MADHYA PRADESH)


02-01-2017

      Shri S.K. Sharma, Advocate for petitioner.
      Shri N.S. Kirar, Panel Lawyer for respondents/State.</pre>
<p id="p_1">      Petitioner; an Aganwadi Karyakarta, has approached this
Court with the grievance that though she is continuing since 1996
and performing her duties to the best of her ability and to the
utmost satisfaction of her superior officers and has an
unblemished service record, however, to her surprise out of blue
she has been visited with the impugned stigmatic order by which
her services have been terminated on allegations which lack facts
and bonafides, moreover she has not been given an opportunity to
rebut the aforesaid allegations before formation of an opinion to
terminate her services.
</p><p id="p_2">      It is submitted that despite having served for more than two
decades as Aganwadi Karyakarta, she has been terminated by a
stroke of pen. Under these circumstances, principles of natural
justice have been frightfully violated, as there is requirement of
notice contemplated under the scheme under which petitioner has
been appointed.
</p><p id="p_3">       Per contra, Shri Kirar, learned Panel Lawyer on advance
notice, has raised a preliminary objection as regards availability
of alternative remedy of appeal under the aforesaid scheme.
Learned counsel contends that the appellate authority shall be in a
best position to address on the contentions advanced in law and
on facts with due advertence to the record and, therefore,
petitioner may be relegated to avail the remedy of appeal.
</p><p id="p_4">        Heard.
</p><p id="p_5">       Considering the fact that petitioner so far has rendered
more than 20 years' service to her credit and admittedly without
notice and opportunity of hearing has been terminated on
allegations which were never confronted to the petitioner before
issuance of impugned order, in the fitness of things the effect and
operation of the impugned order shall remain stayed for the
period of four weeks from today, provided the petitioner files an
appeal within a period of ten days from today. The appellate
authority is directed to decide the appeal within three weeks
therefrom. It is made clear that if appeal is not filed, as directed,
the interim order passed by this Court shall not be effective.
</p><p id="p_6">       With the aforesaid, writ petition stands disposed of.
       It is made clear that this Court has not expressed any
opinion on the merits of the case.
</p>
<p id="p_7">                                                  (ROHIT ARYA)
                                                     JUDGE
