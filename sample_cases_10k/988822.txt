ORAL
JUDGMENT</pre> 

 

<p id="p_1">(Per
: HONOURABLE MR.JUSTICE A.L.DAVE)
 

 


 

</p><p id="p_2">1.	The
petition challenges the judgment and order rendered by the Central
Administrative Tribunal, Ahmedabad Bench at Ahmedabad in Application
No.265 of 2007 rendered on 19th February, 2010, whereby
the Tribunal quashed and set aside chrge sheet dated 16.4.2007,
report of the Inquiry Officer dated 1.9.2007, office order of the ad
hoc disciplinary authority dated 8.10.2007 and the Appellate
Authority's order dated 25.1.2008, and remanded the matter to the
disciplinary authority to proceed with the inquiry from the stage of
considering the request of respondent No.1 for appointment of Defence
Assistant and for cross examination of prosecution witnesses.
</p> 

	
 

<p id="p_3">1.1	The
petitioners challenge the order mainly on the ground that it is
passed in error of law and fact, that it is contrary to the evidence
on record and therefore, is passed without application of mind.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_4">2.	The
Tribunal, in its order in para 55, observed thus:-
</p> 


<p id="p_5">	"Therefore, the
following elementary principles arise for consideration in the light
of above discussion.
</p> 
	  

<p id="p_6">There
	cannot be any trespass as alleged in the charge sheet.
</p>	  

<p id="p_7">The
	alleged incident does not appear to be true judging from the past
	conduct of parties and the circumstances of the case.
</p>	  

<p id="p_8">The
	alleged witnesses have only a post incident role.
</p>	  

<p id="p_9">The
	bias of the authority is self evident.
</p>	  

<p id="p_10">The
	methodology of conduct of inquiry was vitiated by illegality,
	irrationality and was improper and was the result of baseless
	assumptions.
</p>	  

<p id="p_11">The
	Appellate Authority relied on assumption without any legal validity
	and had not applied his mind.
</p>	  

<p id="p_12">The
	non-prosecution of the police case creates significant objectives
	against the fairness of authorities and also points out to covering
	of truth.
</p>	  

<p id="p_13">The
	prejudice of the 4th respondent towards the applicant is
	acknowledged as it is not denied.
</p>	  

<p id="p_14">The
	undue haste in the progress of inquiry even in the face of pendency
	of judicial proceedings and the expression of caution by the
	Tribunal was also not observed.
</p>	  

<p id="p_15">The
	appointment of ad hoc disciplinary authority de hors the circular,
	the actual bias exhibited by inquiry authority and the methodology
	adopted leaves much to be desired and it has vitiated the entire
	process."
</p>
 

<p id="p_16">	The
Tribunal ultimately passed the final order thus:
</p> 


<p id="p_17">	"Therefore, the
impugned charge sheet dated 16.4.2007, report of the Inquiry Officer
dated 1.9.2007, office order of the ad hoc disciplinary authority
dated 8.10.2007 and the Appellate Authority's order dated 25.1.2008,
are hereby quashed and the applicant is directed to be reinstated in
service with all consequential benefits."
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_18">3.	Learned
advocate Mr. Shelat for the petitioner and learned Senior Advocate
Mr. Tanna with Mr. Bhavdutt H. Bhatt for Tanna Associates for
respondent No.1 are heard.  Respondent Nos.2 and 3 are formal parties
being disciplinary authority and the Director of the petitioner
Institute respectively.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_19">4.	Learned
Senior Advocate Mr. Tanna concedes to a situation that the Tribunal,
after what is observed in the body of the judgment, could not have
quashed and set aside charge sheet dated 16.4.2007, particularly when
the Tribunal's direction was of remanding the matter to the Inquiry
Officer for inquiry de novo  from the stage of considering the
request of respondent No.1 for appointment of Defence Assistant and
for cross examination of prosecution witnesses.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_20">5.	On
the other hand, the main grievance of the petitioners are that the
observations made in respect of violation of principles of natural
justice are not justified in facts of the case and the Tribunal could
not have ordered reinstatement of the delinquent.  In support of his
submission, Mr. Shelat has relied on decision in case of  Union
of India V. YS Sadhu, (2008) 12 SCC 30 and submitted that in
every case, reinstatement is not necessary.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_21">6.	Having
regard to the facts of the case, we find that the Tribunal has found
that there were violations of principles of natural justice.  We may
not delve on it in detail,
but we, certainly, find that on an occasion when the delinquent asked
for copies of documents on the previous day of hearing, which were
supplied to him forthwith, and when the delinquent asked for time on
the next day of hearing, the time was not granted, is not a
reasonable approach.  It is true that the delinquent had asked for
the copies, the previous day only, but then the grievance is not that
the copies were supplied, the previous day, but he had received the
copies, the previous day and hence, some time was granted to prepare
himself for his defence.  Grant of time would not have been
unjustified.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_22">7.	The
Tribunal has, however, while remanding the matter, quashed and set
aside the charge sheet while directing inquiry to proceed from the
stage of considering the request of applicant for appointment of
Defence Assistant., this could not have been done.  If the charge
sheet is quashed, the entire proceedings go, which were not even the
intention of the Tribunal and the Tribunal therefore, erred in
quashing the charge sheet.  We are therefore, of the view that, that
part of the order cannot be permitted to stand.  We find that there
is an action on part of the petitioners, which cannot be considered
to be perfectly in order with observance of principles of natural
justice and the matter therefore, has to be remanded to the Inquiry
Officer, as the inquiry itself is, to that extent, vitiated.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_23">8.	Now
comes to the question whether the delinquent - respondent No.1
could or could not have been ordered to be reinstated in service with
all consequential benefits, in our view, a domestic inquiry can
proceed where there is a relationship of employer and employee and if
the order of compulsory retirement continues to operate, that
relationship ceased to exist.  The remand of the matter for inquiry
de novo from any particular stage would be therefore, of no
consequence.  If the inquiry has to proceed, that relationship of
employer and employee has to be restored.  When the matter is
remanded to the Inquiry Officer, the situation, as to exist then, has
to be restored.  In this regard, we need refer to decision in case of
 UP State Spinning Company Limited v. RS Pandey, (2005) 8 SCC
264, where the Lordship observed in para 26 as under:
</p> 


<p id="p_24">	"26.  In view
of the above, we set aside the order of the learned single Judge as
affirmed by the Division Bench by the impugned judgment and direct
that within a period of four months, the enquiry shall be completed
by starting from the stage of service of show-cause notice and
consideration of the reply, if any, filed in accordance with the
standing orders holding the field.  Respondent No.1 shall be
reinstated to service but without any back wages and other service
benefits and his reinstatement shall be solely for the purpose of
completing the departmental proceedings.  His entitlement, if any,
would be adjudicated by the authorities depending upon the result of
the disciplinary proceedings."
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_25">	The
judgment, which is relied upon by Mr. Shelat, also observed thus, in
para 7 after quoting the above portion.
</p> 


<p id="p_26">	"Keeping in
view the aforesaid position of law indicated in the aforesaid
decisions, we are of the view that the course adopted in the two
cases above, is to be violated."
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_27">9.	In
light of what is discussed herein above, we are of the view that the
order of the Tribunal has to be partly set aside to the extent that
it quashes charge sheet dated 16.4.2007 and orders reinstatement of
respondent No.1 in service with all consequential benefits.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_28">10.	While
modifying the direction of reinstatement at the stage from which the
inquiry has to proceed, we remand the proceedings to the Inquiry
Officer to proceed with the departmental inquiry de novo, from
the stage of recording of evidence.  The Inquiry Officer shall
conclude the inquiry within a period eight months from today.  The
order of the Inquiry Officer and the Appellate Authority would stand
quashed and set aside, as ordered by the Tribunal.  Respondent No.1
would be reinstated in service without any back wages or other
service benefits solely for the purpose of completing the
departmental proceedings.  His entitlement, if any, would be
adjudicated by the authorities depending upon the result of the
disciplinary proceedings.  The Inquiry Officer shall take decision
independent of observations made by the Tribunal on merits of the
case and without being influenced by it.  Rule is made absolute to
the aforesaid extent.  No costs.
</p>
