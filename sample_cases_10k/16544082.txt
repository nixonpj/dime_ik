 Nagpur, in Special Criminal Case 63 of 1994, by and under which,

 accused and Smt. Mayuri Deshmukh, the learned Additional Public

 Prosecutor for the respondent / State.
</p>
<p id="p_3">          Shri.   A.K.   Bhangde,  the   learned  counsel   for   the   appellant

 assails the judgment and order impugned primarily on the ground

 that the prosecution has failed to prove the search, seizure and

 recovery of the narcotic substance (Ganja) from the accused.  The

 submission is since both the independent witnesses panch PW 2 -

 Sham Joshi and panch PW 6 - Jagmohan Bhavar did not support

 the   prosecution,  the  learned  Special   Judge  committed  a  serious

 error   in   relying   on   the   sole   testimony,   which   according   to   the

 learned   counsel   Shri.   Bhangde   is   uncorroborated,   of   the   Police

 Officer   Hemant   Pali,   who   is   examined   as   PW   1.     The   learned

 counsel   would   submit   that   the   prosecution   could   have

 corroborated the testimony of PW 1 - Police Officer by examining

 any   other   member   of   the   police   squad   which   included   Police

 Inspector - Mowade.

 Additional Public Prosecutor would submit that there is neither a

 rule of evidence nor of prudence that conviction can not rest on

 the sole testimony of the Police Officer.  The reasons recorded by

 the   learned   Special   judge   in   believing   the   search,   seizure   and

 recovery   of   Ganja   from   the   accused   are   sound,   contends   the

 learned Additional Public Prosecutor.

<p id="p_5">

 4                Having   given   due   consideration   to   the   evidence   on

 record, the submissions advanced and the reasons recorded by the

 learned   Special   Judge,   I   am   inclined   to   agree   with   Shri.   A.K.

 Bhangde, the learned counsel that the accused is entitled to the

 benefit of doubt.

 deprive the accused of personal liberty.

 6                Concededly, both the panch witnesses to the search,

 seizure   and   recovery   of   the   narcotic   substance   (Ganja)   did   not

 support   the   prosecution.     Extensive   cross-examination   failed   to

 extract  any  material  to  assist  the   prosecution.    The  prosecution

 could   have   examined   the   superior   officer   of   PW   1   Police   Head

 Constable Pali who arrived at the spot of the seizure and recovery

 from   the   accused.     The   prosecution   could   have   examined   any

 other member of the police squad.  This has not been done.



 7                It   would   be   apposite   to   refer   to   the   following

 observations of the Hon'ble Apex Court in <a href="/doc/163731048/" id="a_3">Makhan Singh v. State

 of Haryana</a>, 2015 CRI.L.J.3282.
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">          "In the present case, since the vehicle was searched and
          the contraband was seized from the vehicle, compliance
          with <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_4">Section 50</a> of the NDPS Act was not required.  In the
          absence of independent evidence connecting the appellant
          with the fitter-rehra, mere compliance with <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_5">Section 50</a> of
          the NDPS Act by itself would not be sufficient to establish
          the guilt of the appellant.  It is a well settled principle of
          the   criminal   jurisprudence   that   more   stringent   the
          punishment,   the   more   heavy   is   the   burden   upon   the
          prosecution to prove the offence.  When the independent
          witnesses   PW   1   and   DW   2   have   not   supported   the
          prosecution case and the recovery of the contraband has
          not   been   satisfactorily   proved,   the   conviction   of   the
          appellant under  <a href="/doc/1046310/" id="a_6">section 15</a> of the NDPS  Act cannot be
          sustained".</blockquote><p id="p_8">


</p><p id="p_9">          The learned Single Judge of this Court in  Manish Kumar

 Tak Vs. State of Goa, 2002 ALL MR (Cri) 1049  was pleased to

 observe thus:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">          "The next question that remains is whether the conviction
          of the appellant can be sustained on the uncorroborated
          testimony of P.W. 1 P.I. Mamledar.  The prosecution had
          an   opportunity   of   tendering   corroborative   evidence   by
          examining Deputy Superintendent of Police A.K. Teli.   A
          summons was issued to Deputy Superintendent of Police
          A.K. Teli at the behest of the prosecution but it appears
          that Deputy Superintendent of Police A.K. Teli never came
          to be examined.  The evidence of P.W. 3 Gurunath Naik
          and   P.W.   4   P.I.   Mamledar   in   respect   of   apprising   the
          appellant   of   his   right   under   <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_7">section   50</a>   is   discrepant.
          Apart   from   that,   since   there   is   no   other   corroborative
          evidence   in   respect   of   search   of   the   appellant   and   the
          consequent seizure of the contraband, i consider it highly
          unsafe   to   rely   on   the   solitary   evidence   of   P.W.   4   P.I.
          Mamledar for sustaining the conviction".
</blockquote>

<p id="p_11"> 8                On a holistic appreciation of the evidence on record, I

 consider   it   to   be   extremely   unsafe   and   hazardous   to   allow   the

 conviction to rest on the sole testimony of Police Head Constable -

 Pali - PW 1.  The accused is entitled to be extended the benefit of

 the doubt, which I do.
</p>
<p id="p_12"> 9        The judgment and order impugned is set aside.

 10       The accused is acquitted of offence punishable under <a href="/doc/1557102/" id="a_8">section
