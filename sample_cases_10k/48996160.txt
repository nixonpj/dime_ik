</blockquote>
<p id="p_9">4.    The case of the petitioners in Special Civil Application No. 8799

of 2013 is that they were selected for training for the post of Female

Health Worker and completed training of one and half year

successfully. The Government vide communication dated 5.12.1994

sanctioned 67 posts of Female Health Worker for Ahmedabad District

out of total 825 posts throughout the State. The Government then

issued direction to the Panchayat Service Selection Board to take

examination of the petitioners and identically situated trainees for

regular appointment. However, the examination was not taken but

due to shortage of Female Health Workers, the Government decided

to permit ad-hoc appointments. The petitioners were then issued call

letters for interview and were appointed on the basis of such

interview in the month of January, 1996 as Female Health Workers

on ad-hoc basis for a period of six months but thereafter continued

from time to time and as on the date of filing of the petition,

completed the continuous service of 17 years without any break. In

the year 2010, the Government had issued advertisement for filing

the posts of     Female Health Worker and, therefore, the petitioners

and other employees had preferred different petitions. Learned Single

Judge of this Court dismissed such petitions against which the Letters

Patent Appeals were preferred and the same were also dismissed by



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                Page 4 of 25</span>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">        C/LPA/923/2014                                     CAV JUDGMENT</span>



the Division Bench on 27.7.2010 on the basis of the earlier decision

rendered in similar matters being Letters Patent Appeal No. 85 of

2010 and allied matters. It is the further case of the petitioners that

even after the above said judgment, the petitioners were continued in

service. They applied for regularization pursuant to advertisement

issued in the year 2011 which was rejected by cyclostyled order

dated 18.5.2012. It is also their case that earlier when the petitions

were decided,           the decision in the case of     Secretary, State of

Karnataka and Ors. Vs. Umadevi and others 2006(4) SCC 1 was not

considered and as per this decision, services of the petitioners are

required to be regularized.
</p>


<p id="p_10">5.    In so far as the petitioners of Special Civil Application No. 8800

of 2013 - appellants in Letters Patent Appeal No. 924 of 2014 and

1006 of 2014 are concerned, it is their case that right from January,

1996, their ad-hoc appointments as Female Health Workers have

been continued. However, the respondents have now come out with

advertisement for replacing them by new candidates on contract

basis. As    per the new policy of the State Government, such new

appointments shall be on fixed salary                 basis not exceeding

Rs.4500.00 per month. They have averred that they have acquired

experience by serving for more than 17 years and need to be

absorbed and regularized. They have challenged order dated

6.3.2012 passed against them to put an end to their service and

sought direction not to terminate their services and to absorb and



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                     Page 5 of 25</span>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">        C/LPA/923/2014                                        CAV JUDGMENT</span>



regularize their services as Female Health Workers from the date

when they joined the services with the respondents.
</p>


<p id="p_11">6.     Learned Single Judge decided both the petitions by common

judgment. Learned Single Judge came to the conclusion that the plea

of regularization by second round of litigation was barred by the

principles of constructive res-judicata and also came to the

conclusion that the petitioners were aware that their appointments

were   without          following   the   prescribed   procedure    with    clear

stipulations in their appointment orders that they were appointed on

ad-hoc basis and since the Division Bench of this Court had

categorically held that the direction to regularize their services could

not be granted, the petitions deserved dismissal. Accordingly the

petitions were dismissed.
</p>


<p id="p_12">7.     We have heard the learned advocates for the parties. Learned

Senior Advocate Mr. Shalin N. Mehta appearing with learned advocate

Ms. Nimisha Sharma for the petitioners submitted that all the

appellants having completed about 17 years of continuous service as

Female Health Worker are entitled to urge for regularization of their

services as per the directions issued by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in

the case of Umadevi (supra). Mr. Mehta submitted that the principle

of res-judicata has no place to stand in the facts of the case as,

irrespective of the appellants approaching the Court for regularization

of their services in terms of the decision             in the case of Umadevi



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                                      Page 6 of 25</span>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">        C/LPA/923/2014                                CAV JUDGMENT</span>



(supra), it was obligatory on the part of the State to undertake an

exercise for regularization of the services of the employees who have

put in more than ten years continuous service. Mr. Mehta submitted

that in the case of State of Karnataka and others versus

M.L.Kesari and others reported in (2010) 9 SCC 247, Hon'ble

Supreme Court has made above aspects very clear by observing that

those employees who were not considered in terms of para 53 of

Umadevi's case were required to be considered within six months and

no employee was required to approach the Court. Mr. Mehta

submitted that when such was the declaration of law, and since the

decision in the case of Umadevi was not brought to the notice of the

Division Bench at the relevant time, there is no question of applying

the principles of res-judicata to the case of the appellants. Mr. Mehta

submitted that in fact, the judgment rendered by the learned Single

Judge and by the Hon'ble Division Bench in earlier round of litigation

in respect of some of the appellants could be said to be per incurium

as the same was in ignorance of the decision in Umadevi's case.
</p>


<p id="p_13">8.    Mr. Mehta submitted that the appellants were not illegally

recruited but had successfully passed the training for Female Health

Worker and the interview for the said post and were then appointed

as Female Health Worker. Mr. Mehta submitted that though initial

appointment was for short period and termed as ad-hoc, however,

such could not be said tobe in any way illegal appointment. Mr. Mehta

submitted that it was only on account of the State's decision to

employ the petitioners on ad-hoc basis though they were duly

selected, the appointments of the petitioners were branded as ad-hoc

appointments, otherwise, for all purposes, the appointments were

legally made. Mr. Mehta submitted that the directions issued in the

case of Umadevi (supra) is exactly for           such employees who were

irregularly appointed and completed more than 10 years of

continuous service. Mr. Mehta submitted that considering the

decision in the case of Umadevi (supra) which was explained in M.L.
</p>
<p id="p_14">Kesari (supra), the view taken in the earlier round of litigation by the

Division Bench of this Court will not come in the way of the appellants

for regularization of their services especially when after the decision

of the Division Bench of this Court, the appellants have been

continued in service.       Mr.   Mehta submitted that the orders of

termination passed against the appellants are contrary to law and,

therefore, required to be quashed and set aside and the respondents

are required to be restrained from employing any new hands in place

of the appellants and the services of the appellants are required to be

regularized. Mr. Mehta thus urged to allow these appeals.

<p id="p_16">Munshaw         appearing   for   the    concerned    District   Panchayat/s

absence of availability of regularly selected candidate would not

confer any right upon them to claim regularization of their services.
</p>
<p id="p_17">Mr. Munshaw submitted that the appellants are also not entitled to

come with fresh petitions for the same relief of regularization having

once failed before the division Bench of this Court. Mr. Munshaw

submitted that when Division Bench of this court decided the cases of

the appellants, the judgment         in the case of Umadevi (supra) was

already available,       however, it was not pressed into service and,

therefore, it could be said that the appellants had waived their right

to get their cases considered in terms of the decision in the case of

Umadevi (supra). Mr. Munshaw submitted that in such view of the

matter, the learned Single Judge committed no error in holding that

the second round of litigation initiated by the appellants is barred by

the principles of res-judicata. Mr. Munshaw             thus, urged not to

entertain the appeals.

<p id="p_18">10.    Having heard the learned advocates for the parties, it appears

that the Government granted sanction to make ad-hoc appointments

of female health workers till the regularly selected candidates were

made     available.      The   petitioners    were   therefore   issued   the

appointment orders by the District Health Officer without process of

regular selection by the service selection board. Such appointments

were purely ad-hoc and continued thereafter.

issued advertisement for filling up the posts of female health workers,

petitioners of Special Civil Application No. 8799 of 2013 had remained

unsuccessful before this Court in above referred the writ petitions and

then the Letters Patent Appeals. Following is the order passed in their

appeals.
</p>


<blockquote id="blockquote_8">      "Heard the learned counsel for the appellant.
      In similar set of facts and circumstances, this Court has
      already taken a view that those who were selected on
      ad-hoc basis, were required to face selection. The
      appellants have not faced selection, their earlier
      selection being ad-hoc and no procedure having been
      followed according to the Rules, the relief for
      regularization cannot be granted. In that view of the
      matter, the law laid down by this Court, vide order dated
      20.7.2010, in the case of Surekhaben Chamarbhai Patel
      and others Vs. State of Gujarat and others in Letters

<p id="p_20">12.   It appears that before the appeals filed by the petitioners were

dismissed, the Division Bench of this Court had examined the cases of

many such similarly situated female health workers as regards their

prayer for regularization and dismissed the Letters Patent Appeal No.

85 of 2010 and other allied matters           by order dated 20.7.2010

wherein the Division Bench made following observations in paragraph

15:

<blockquote id="blockquote_10">           "15. As an upshot of the aforesaid discussion it

        prescribed procedure and such irregular appointments
        cannot be directed to regularized. The Act of
        regularizing such irregularly made appointments would
        amount to multiplying the irregularity. As noted above,
        such irregular appointment        and the practice of
        subsequently regularizing such irregular appointments,
        deprive several hundred of other qualified and eligible
        persons and thereby violate the mandate of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_1">Article 14</a>
        of the Constitution of India. Hence, the relief prayed for
        cannot be granted.

        error or infirmity in the impugned orders whereby the

        fail and deserve to be rejected. Hence, they are
        accordingly rejected. No costs."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_21">13.   Since the petitioners of Special Civil Application No.8799 of

2013 were similarly situated, their appeals were also dismissed as

stated above relying on the decision in Letters Patent Appeal No.85 of

2010 and allied matters.
</p>


<p id="p_22">14.   There is no dispute that the petitioners of Special Civil

Application No. 8800 of 2013 stand similarly situated to the

petitioners of special civil application no.8799 of 2013 and, therefore,

decision of the Division Bench in the above referred Letters Patent

Appeal (No.85 of 2010) would apply to their case also.
</p>


<p id="p_23">15.   In view of such undisputed facts, the learned Single Judge held

that the principles of constructive res-judicata would apply to the

case of the petitioners.

submitted that since the decision in the case of Umadevi (supra) was

not brought to the notice of the Division Bench, there is no question

of applying the principles of constructive res-judicata. Mr. Mehta also

submitted that even the principles of per incurium would apply in the

facts of the case as the Division Bench rendered decision contrary to

the law laid down in the case of Umadevi (supra), and the same

would not prevent the petitioners to agitate their grievance on the

same facts and to pray for the same relief on the basis of the decision

in the case of Umadevi (supra).
</p>
<p id="p_25">17.    It is required to be noted that the Division Bench having

refused to entertain the prayers for regularization, the decision on

such issue has become final on the facts present before it. Therefore,

it is not correct to say that the principles analogous to res-judicata

cannot have any application. If the petitioners wanted the benefit of

the decision in the case of Umadevi (supra), same could have been

pressed into service when the decision was rendered by the Division

Bench in the earlier round. When such decision was not brought to

the notice of the Division Bench by the petitioners, they cannot now

urge    to maintain their petition       contending that the decision

rendered by the division bench of this court was per incurium. In fact,

what was held by the Division Bench was in the facts of the case

having found that the appointments of the petitioners were without

following prescribed procedure, they could not be regularized as the

same would deprive several hundreds of other qualified and eligible

candidates which would for them violate the mandate of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_2">Article 14</a> of

the Constitution of India. If the petitioners had any grievance against

such decision of the Division Bench, the remedy available to the

petitioners was to approach the higher forum. As regards other

petitioners, since they stand on the same footing, the decision

rendered by the Division Bench should apply to them with all force. In

their case, the principles of constructive res-judicata may not apply

strictly but the fact remains that they would not stand to gain

because they have now come to the Court when the issues are

already concluded earlier by this Court. We are therefore of the view

that learned Single Judge has committed no error in holding that in

view of decision of Division Bench referred above, the petitioners do

not deserve any relief.
</p>


<p id="p_26">18.   In the case of Umadevi (supra), the Hon'ble Supreme Court has

held and observed in paragraph 43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51 and 52

as under:
</p>


<blockquote id="blockquote_12">      "43. Thus, it is clear that adherence to the rule of equality in public
      employment is a basic feature of our Constitution and since the rule of
      law is the core of our Constitution, a Court would certainly be disabled
      from passing an order upholding a violation of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_3">Article 14</a> or in ordering
      the overlooking of the need to comply with the requirements of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_4">Article
      14</a> read with <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_5">Article 16</a> of the Constitution. Therefore, consistent with
      the scheme for public employment, this Court while laying down the
      law, has necessarily to hold that unless the appointment is in terms of
      the relevant rules and after a proper competition among qualified
      persons, the same would not confer any right on the appointee. If it is a
      contractual appointment, the appointment comes to an end at the end
      of the contract, if it were an engagement or appointment on daily
      wages or casual basis, the same would come to an end when it is
      discontinued. Similarly, a temporary employee could not claim to be
      made permanent on the expiry of his term of appointment. It has also to
      be clarified that merely because a temporary employee or a casual

wage worker is continued for a time beyond the term of his
appointment, he would not be entitled to be absorbed in regular service
or made permanent, merely on the strength of such continuance, if the
original appointment was not made by following a due process of
selection as envisaged by the relevant rules. It is not open to the court
to prevent regular recruitment at the instance of temporary employees
whose period of employment has come to an end or of ad hoc
employees who by the very nature of their appointment, do not acquire
any right. High Courts acting under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_6">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of
India, should not ordinarily issue directions for absorption,
regularization, or permanent continuance unless the recruitment itself
was made regularly and in terms of the constitutional scheme. Merely
because, an employee had continued under cover of an order of Court,
which we have described as 'litigious employment' in the earlier part of
the judgment, he would not be entitled to any right to be absorbed or
made permanent in the service. In fact, in such cases, the High Court
may not be justified in issuing interim directions, since, after all, if
ultimately the employee approaching it is found entitled to relief, it may
be possible for it to mould the relief in such a manner that ultimately no
prejudice will be caused to him, whereas an interim direction to
continue his employment would hold up the regular procedure for
selection or impose on the State the burden of paying an employee
who is really not required. The courts must be careful in ensuring that
they do not interfere unduly with the economic arrangement of its
affairs by the State or its instrumentalities or lend themselves the
instruments to facilitate the bypassing of the constitutional and statutory
mandates.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_27">44.. The concept of 'equal pay for equal work' is different from the
concept of conferring permanency on those who have been appointed
on ad hoc basis, temporary basis, or based on no process of selection
as envisaged by the Rules. This Court has in various decisions applied
the principle of equal pay for equal work and has laid down the
parameters for the application of that principle. The decisions are
rested on the concept of equality enshrined in our Constitution in the
light of the directive principles in that behalf. But the acceptance of that
principle cannot lead to a position where the court could direct that
appointments made without following the due procedure established by
law, be deemed permanent or issue directions to treat them as
permanent. Doing so, would be negation of the principle of equality of
opportunity. The power to make an order as is necessary for doing
complete justice in any cause or matter pending before this Court,
would not normally be used for giving the go-by to the procedure
established by law in the matter of public employment. Take the
situation arising in the cases before us from the State of Karnataka.
Therein, after the Dharwad decision, the Government had issued
repeated directions and mandatory orders that no temporary or ad hoc
employment or engagement be given. Some of the authorities and
departments had ignored those directions or defied those directions
and had continued to give employment, specifically interdicted by the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">                             Page 14 of 25</span>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_28">  C/LPA/923/2014                                       CAV JUDGMENT</span>



orders issued by the executive. Some of the appointing officers have
even been punished for their defiance. It would not be just or proper to
pass an order in exercise of jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_7">Article 226</a> or 32 of the
Constitution or in exercise of power under <a href="/doc/500307/" id="a_8">Article 142</a> of the
Constitution of India permitting those persons engaged, to be absorbed
or to be made permanent, based on their appointments or
engagements. Complete justice would be justice according to law and
though it would be open to this Court to mould the relief, this Court
would not grant a relief which would amount to perpetuating an
illegality.
</p>
<p id="p_28">45.     .While directing that appointments, temporary or casual, be
regularized or made permanent, courts are swayed by the fact that the
concerned person has worked for some time and in some cases for a
considerable length of time. It is not as if the person who accepts an
engagement either temporary or casual in nature, is not aware of the
nature of his employment. He accepts the employment with eyes open.
It may be true that he is not in a position to bargain - not at arms length
</p><p id="p_29">- since he might have been searching for some employment so as to
eke out his livelihood and accepts whatever he gets. But on that ground
alone, it would not be appropriate to jettison the constitutional scheme
of appointment and to take the view that a person who has temporarily
or casually got employed should be directed to be continued
permanently. By doing so, it will be creating another mode of public
appointment which is not permissible.If the court were to void a
contractual employment of this nature on the ground that the parties
were not having equal bargaining power, that too would not enable the
court to grant any relief to that employee. A total embargo on such
casual or temporary employment is not possible, given the exigencies
of administration and if imposed, would only mean that some people
who at least get employment temporarily, contractually or casually,
would not be getting even that employment when securing of such
employment brings at least some succor to them. After all, innumerable
citizens of our vast country are in search of employment and one is not
compelled to accept a casual or temporary employment if one is not
inclined to go in for such an employment. It is in that context that one
has to proceed on the basis that the employment was accepted fully
knowing the nature of it and the consequences flowing from it. In other
words, even while accepting the employment, the person concerned
knows the nature of his employment. It is not an appointment to a post
in the real sense of the term. The claim acquired by him in the post in
which he is temporarily employed or the interest in that post cannot be
considered to be of such a magnitude as to enable the giving up of the
procedure established, for making regular appointments to available
posts in the services of the State. The argument that since one has
been working for some time in the post, it will not be just to discontinue
him, even though he was aware of the nature of the employment when
he first took it up, is not one that would enable the jettisoning of the
procedure established by law for public employment and would have to
fail when tested on the touchstone of constitutionality and equality of

opportunity enshrined in <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_9">Article 14</a> of the Constitution of India.
</p>
<p id="p_30">46.     Learned Senior Counsel for some of the respondents argued
that on the basis of the doctrine of legitimate expectation, the
employees, especially of the Commercial Taxes Department, should be
directed to be regularized since the decisions in Dharwad (supra),
Piara Singh (supra), Jacob, and Gujarat Agricultural University and the
like, have given rise to an expectation in them that their services would
also be regularized.The doctrine can be invoked if the decisions of the
Administrative Authority affect the person by depriving him of some
benefit or advantage which either (i) he had in the past been permitted
by the decision-maker to enjoy and which he can legitimately expect to
be permitted to continue to do until there have been communicated to
him some rational grounds for withdrawing it on which he has been
given an opportunity to comment; or (ii) he has received assurance
from the decision-maker that they will not be withdrawn without giving
him first an opportunity of advancing reasons for contending that they
should not be withdrawn {See Lord Diplock in Council of Civil Service
Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service (1985 Appeal Cases 374),
<a href="/doc/1908449/" id="a_10">National Buildings Construction Corpn. v. S. Raghunathan</a>, (1998 (7)
SCC 66) and <a href="/doc/1926455/" id="a_11">Dr. Chanchal Goyal v. State of Rajasthan</a> (2003 (3) SCC
</p><p id="p_31">485).There is no case that any assurance was given by the
Government or the concerned department while making the
appointment on daily wages that the status conferred on him will not be
withdrawn until some rational reason comes into existence for
withdrawing it. The very engagement was against the constitutional
scheme. Though, the Commissioner of the Commercial Taxes
Department sought to get the appointments made permanent, there is
no case that at the time of appointment any promise was held out.No
such promise could also have been held out in view of the circulars and
directives issued by the Government after the Dharwad decision.
Though, there is a case that the State had made regularizations in the
past of similarly situated employees, the fact remains that such
regularizations were done only pursuant to judicial directions, either of
the Administrative Tribunal or of the High Court and in some case by
this Court. Moreover, the invocation of the doctrine of legitimate
expectation cannot enable the employees to claim that they must be
made permanent or they must be regularized in the service though they
had not been selected in terms of the rules for appointment. The fact
that in certain cases the court had directed regularization of the
employees involved in those cases cannot be made use of to found a
claim based on legitimate expectation. The argument if accepted would
also run counter to the constitutional mandate. The argument in that
behalf has therefore to be rejected.
</p>
<p id="p_32">47.   When a person enters a temporary employment or gets
engagement as a contractual or casual worker and the engagement is
not based on a proper selection as recognized by the relevant rules or
procedure, he is aware of the consequences of the appointment being
temporary, casual or contractual in nature. Such a person cannot


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_31">                            Page 16 of 25</span>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_32">  C/LPA/923/2014                                      CAV JUDGMENT</span>



invoke the theory of legitimate expectation for being confirmed in the
post when an appointment to the post could be made only by following
a proper procedure for selection and in concerned cases, in
consultation with the Public Service Commission. Therefore, the theory
of legitimate expectation cannot be successfully advanced by
temporary, contractual or casual employees. It cannot also be held that
the State has held out any promise while engaging these persons
either to continue them where they are or to make them permanent.
The State cannot constitutionally make such a promise. It is also
obvious that the theory cannot be invoked to seek a positive relief of
being made permanent in the post.
</p>
<p id="p_33">48.     It was then contended that the rights of the employees thus
appointed, under Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution, are violated. It
is stated that the State has treated the employees unfairly by
employing them on less than minimum wages and extracting work from
them for a pretty long period in comparison with those directly recruited
who are getting more wages or salaries for doing similar work.The
employees before us were engaged on daily wages in the concerned
department on a wage that was made known to them. There is no case
that the wage agreed upon was not being paid. Those who are working
on daily wages formed a class by themselves, they cannot claim that
they are discriminated as against those who have been regularly
recruited on the basis of the relevant rules. No right can be founded on
an employment on daily wages to claim that such employee should be
treated on a par with a regularly recruited candidate, and made
permanent in employment, even assuming that the principle could be
invoked for claiming equal wages for equal work. There is no
fundamental right in those who have been employed on daily wages or
temporarily or on contractual basis, to claim that they have a right to be
absorbed in service. As has been held by this Court, they cannot be
said to be holders of a post, since, a regular appointment could be
made only by making appointments consistent with the requirements of
Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution. The right to be treated equally
with the other employees employed on daily wages, cannot be
extended to a claim for equal treatment with those who were regularly
employed. That would be treating unequals as equals. It cannot also be
relied on to claim a right to be absorbed in service even though they
have never been selected in terms of the relevant recruitment rules.
The arguments based on Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution are
therefore overruled.
</p>
<p id="p_34">49.    It is contended that the State action in not regularizing the
employees was not fair within the framework of the rule of law. The rule
of law compels the State to make appointments as envisaged by the
Constitution and in the manner we have indicated earlier. In most of
these cases, no doubt, the employees had worked for some length of
time but this has also been brought about by the pendency of
proceedings in Tribunals and courts initiated at the instance of the
employees. Moreover, accepting an argument of this nature would


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_33">                            Page 17 of 25</span>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_34">  C/LPA/923/2014                                      CAV JUDGMENT</span>



mean that the State would be permitted to perpetuate an illegality in the
matter of public employment and that would be a negation of the
constitutional scheme adopted by us, the people of India. It is therefore
not possible to accept the argument that there must be a direction to
make permanent all the persons employed on daily wages. When the
court is approached for relief by way of a writ, the court has necessarily
to ask itself whether the person before it had any legal right to be
enforced. Considered in the light of the very clear constitutional
scheme, it cannot be said that the employees have been able to
establish a legal right to be made permanent even though they have
never been appointed in terms of the relevant rules or in adherence of
Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution.
</p>
<p id="p_35">50.     It is argued that in a country like India where there is so much
poverty and unemployment and there is no equality of bargaining
power, the action of the State in not making the employees permanent,
would be violative of <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_12">Article 21</a> of the Constitution. But the very
argument indicates that there are so many waiting for employment and
an equal opportunity for competing for employment and it is in that
context that the Constitution as one of its basic features, has included
Articles 14, 16 and 309 so as to ensure that public employment is given
only in a fair and equitable manner by giving all those who are
qualified, an opportunity to seek employment. In the guise of upholding
rights under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_13">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India, a set of persons
cannot be preferred over a vast majority of people waiting for an
opportunity to compete for State employment. The acceptance of the
argument on behalf of the respondents would really negate the rights of
the others conferred by <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_14">Article 21</a> of the Constitution, assuming that we
are in a position to hold that the right to employment is also a right
coming within the purview of <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_15">Article 21</a> of the Constitution. The
argument that <a href="/doc/1071750/" id="a_16">Article 23</a> of the Constitution is breached because the
employment on daily wages amounts to forced labour, cannot be
accepted. After all, the employees accepted the employment at their
own volition and with eyes open as to the nature of their employment.
The Governments also revised the minimum wages payable from time
to time in the light of all relevant circumstances. It also appears to us
that importing of these theories to defeat the basic requirement of
public employment would defeat the constitutional scheme and the
constitutional goal of equality.

<p id="p_36">51.     The argument that the right to life protected by <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_17">Article 21</a> of the
Constitution of India would include the right to employment cannot also
be accepted at this juncture. The law is dynamic and our Constitution is
a living document. May be at some future point of time, the right to
employment can also be brought in under the concept of right to life or
even included as a fundamental right. The new statute is perhaps a
beginning. As things now stand, the acceptance of such a plea at the
instance of the employees before us would lead to the consequence of
depriving a large number of other aspirants of an opportunity to
compete for the post or employment. Their right to employment, if it is a

      part of right to life, would stand denuded by the preferring of those who
      have got in casually or those who have come through the back door.
      The obligation cast on the State under <a href="/doc/1331994/" id="a_18">Article 39(a)</a> of the Constitution
      of India is to ensure that all citizens equally have the right to adequate
      means of livelihood. It will be more consistent with that policy if the
      courts recognize that an appointment to a post in Government service
      or in the service of its instrumentalities, can only be by way of a proper
      selection in the manner recognized by the relevant legislation in the
      context of the relevant provisions of the Constitution. In the name of
      individualizing justice, it is also not possible to shut our eyes to the
      constitutional scheme and the right of the numerous as against the few
      who are before the court. The Directive Principles of State Policy have
      also to be reconciled with the rights available to the citizen under Part
      III of the Constitution and the obligation of the State to one and all and
      not to a particular group of citizens. We, therefore, overrule the
      argument based on <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_19">Article 21</a> of the Constitution.
</p>
<p id="p_37">      52. Normally, what is sought for by such temporary
      employees when they approach the court, is the issue of a writ
      of mandamus directing the employer, the State or its
      instrumentalities, to absorb them in permanent service or to
      allow them to continue. In this context, the question arises
      whether a mandamus could be issued in favour of such
      persons. At this juncture, it will be proper to refer to the
      decision of the Constitution Bench of this Court in <a href="/doc/1734503/" id="a_20">Dr. Rai
      Shivendra Bahadur v. The Governing Body of the Nalanda
      College</a> [(1962) Supp 2 SCR 144]. That case arose out of a
      refusal to promote the writ petitioner therein as the Principal of
      a college. This Court held that in order that a mandamus may
      issue to compel the authorities to do something, it must be
      shown that the statute imposes a legal duty on the authority
      and the aggrieved party had a legal right under the statute or
      rule to enforce it. This classical position continues and a
      mandamus could not be issued in favour of the employees
      directing the Government to make them permanent since the
      employees cannot show that they have an enforceable legal
      right to be permanently absorbed or that the State has a legal
      duty to make them permanent. "

<p id="p_38">19.   After the above discussion and the view expressed, the Hon'ble

Supreme Court then observed in paragraph 53 as under:

      employees have continued to work for ten years or more but
      without the intervention of orders of courts or of tribunals. The
      question of regularization of the services of such employees
      may have to be considered on merits in the light of the
      principles settled by this Court in the cases above referred to
      and in the light of this judgment. In that context, the Union of

      such irregularly appointed, who have worked for ten years or
      more in duly sanctioned posts but not under cover of orders of

      employees or daily wagers are being now employed. The
      process must be set in motion within six months from this date.
      We also clarify that regularization, if any already made, but not
      sub judice, need not be reopened based on this judgment, but
      there should be no further by-passing of the constitutional
      requirement and regularizing or making permanent, those not
      duly appointed as per the constitutional scheme."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_39">20.   Relying on the observations made in paragraph 53, it is urged

that the petitioners have become entitled to regularization of their

services having put in more than 10 years of service.
</p>


<p id="p_40">21.   What is further contended on behalf of the petitioners is that

the directives contained in paragraph 53 in Umadevi's case (supra)

are to be followed by the State Authority on its own without forcing

any employee to approach the Court as observed in later decision in

the case of M.L. Kesari (supra).

Constitution   Bench   of   this   Court  held   that
appointments made without following the due process
or the rules relating to appointment did not confer
any right on the appointees and courts cannot direct
their absorption, regularization or re-engagement
nor make their service permanent, and the High Court
in exercise of jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_22">Article 226</a> of the
Constitution should not ordinarily issue directions
for   absorption,    regularization,   or   permanent
continuance unless the recruitment had been done in
a regular manner, in terms of the constitutional
scheme; and that the courts must be careful in
ensuring that they do not interfere unduly with the
economic arrangement of its affairs by the State or
its instrumentalities, nor lend themselves to be
instruments to facilitate the bypassing of the
constitutional and statutory mandates.
</p>
<p id="p_43">6.   This Court further held that a temporary,
contractual, casual or a daily-wage employee does
not have a legal right to be made permanent unless
he had been appointed in terms of the relevant rules
or in adherence of Articles 14 and 16 of the
Constitution.   This   Court,   however,  made   one
exception to the above position and the same is
extracted below (SCC p.42, para 53)

  "53. One aspect needs to be clarified. There may
  be cases where irregular appointments (not illegal
  appointments) as explained in S.V. Narayanappa

   undertaken to fill those vacant sanctioned posts
   that require to be filled up, in cases where
   temporary employees or daily wagers are being now
   employed. The process must be set in motion within
   six months from this date....."
</p><p id="p_45">                                 (emphasis supplied)

</p><p id="p_46">7.    It is evident from the above that there is an
exception   to   the    general    principles   against
'regularization'   enunciated   in   Umadevi,  if   the
following conditions are fulfilled :
</p><p id="p_47">(i) The employee concerned should have worked for 10
years or more in duly sanctioned post without the
benefit or protection of the interim order of any
court or tribunal. In other words, the State
Government   or  its    instrumentality   should   have
employed the employee and continued him in service
voluntarily and continuously for more than ten years.
</p>
<p id="p_48">(ii) The appointment of such employee should not be
illegal, even if irregular. Where the appointments
are not made or continued against sanctioned posts or
where the persons appointed do not possess the
prescribed minimum qualifications, the appointments
will be considered to be illegal. But where the
person    employed     possessed    the     prescribed
qualifications and was working against sanctioned
posts, but had been selected without undergoing the
process   of   open   competitive    selection,   such
appointments are considered to be irregular.
</p>
<p id="p_49">8.    Umadevi casts a duty upon the concerned
Government or instrumentality, to take steps to
regularize   the   services   of   those   irregularly
appointed employees who had served for more than ten
years without the benefit or protection of any
interim orders of courts or tribunals, as a one-time
measure. Umadevi, directed that such one-time measure
must be set in motion within six months from the date
of its decision (rendered on 10.4.2006).
</p><p id="p_50">9.    The   term  'one-time   measure'   has   to   be
understood in its proper perspective. This would
normally mean that after the decision in Umadevi (AIR
2006 SC 1806 : 2006 AIR SCW 1991), each department or
each instrumentality should undertake a one-time
exercise and prepare a list of all casual, daily-wage
or ad hoc employees who have been working for more
than ten years without the intervention of courts and
tribunals and subject them to a process verification
as to whether they are working against vacant posts
and possess the requisite qualification for the post


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_43">                     Page 22 of 25</span>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_44">  C/LPA/923/2014                         CAV JUDGMENT</span>



and if so, regularize their services.
</p>
<p id="p_51">10.   At the end of six months from the date of
decision in Umadevi, cases of several daily-wage/ad
hoc/casual   employees   were  still   pending   before
Courts.    Consequently,   several   departments    and
instrumentalities did not commence the one-time
regularization process. On the other hand, some
Government departments or instrumentalities undertook
the one-time exercise excluding several employees
from consideration either on the ground that their
cases were pending in courts or due to sheer
oversight. In such circumstances, the employees who
were entitled to be considered in terms of Para 53 of
the decision in Umadevi, will not lose their right to
be considered for regularization, merely because the
one-time exercise was completed without considering
their cases, or because the six months' period
mentioned in para 53 of Umadevi has expired. The one-
time exercise should consider all daily-wage/ad
hoc/those employees who had put in 10 years of
continuous service as on 10.4.2006 without availing
the protection of any interim orders of courts or
tribunals. If any employer had held the one-time
exercise in terms of para 53 of Umadevi, but did not
consider the cases of some employees who were
entitled to the benefit of para 53 of Umadevi, the
employer concerned should consider their cases also,
as a continuation of the one-time exercise. The one
time exercise will be concluded only when all the
employees who are entitled to be considered in terms
of Para 53 of Umadevi, are so considered.
</p>
<p id="p_52">11.   The object behind the said direction in para 53
of Umadevi is two-fold. First is to ensure that those
who have put in more than ten years of continuous
service without the protection of any interim orders
of courts or tribunals, before the date of decision
in Umadevi 2006, are considered for regularization in
view of their long service. Second is to ensure that
the departments/instrumentalities do not perpetuate
the practice of employing persons on daily-wage/ ad
hoc/casual for long periods and then periodically
regularize them on the ground that they have served
for more than ten years, thereby defeating the
constitutional or statutory provisions relating to
recruitment and appointment. The true effect of the
direction is that all persons who have worked for
more than ten years as on 10.4.2006 (the date of
decision in Umadevi) without the protection of any
interim order of any court or tribunal, in vacant


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_45">                     Page 23 of 25</span>

      posts, possessing the requisite qualification, are
      entitled to be considered for regularization. The
      fact that the employer has not undertaken such
      exercise of regularization within six months of the
      decision in Umadevi or that such exercise was
      undertaken only in regard to a limited few, will not
      disentitle such employees, the right to be considered
      for regularization in terms of the above directions
      in Umadevi as a one-time measure."
</p>

<p id="p_53">23.   There is no dispute about the fact that the recruitment to the

post of Female Health Worker was to be made only through the

Service Selection Board. As stated in the affidavit in reply filed with

the petition, since the process for such recruitment was to take some

time, the Government through Panchayat Housing and Rural

Development Department issued instruction dated 10.11.1995 to all

the District Development Officers to fill up the posts of Female Health

Workers on temporary, ad-hoc and time bound basis with condition

that the service of such appointee would be liable to be terminated at

any point of time. It is further stated in the affidavit that when there

was advertisement to fill in the post on regular basis, the appellants

failed to grab opportunity for regular appointment as they did not

apply in response to the advertisement inspite of relaxation qua

upper age limit was granted. The appellants thus continued in service

with the same status as ad-hoc employees. As stated above, the

Division Bench having found that the appointments of the appellants

were not through prescribed procedure i.e. not through selection

process by the service selection board, they did not acquire any right

to be regularized. In such view of the matter, it will be now not open

to this Court to delve upon the same issue again.
