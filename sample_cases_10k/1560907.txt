JUDGMENT 
</pre>
 

<p id="p_1">(Per
: MR.JUSTICE D.H.WAGHELA)
 

 


 

</p><p id="p_2">1.		The
original parties on both sides in SCA No.10862  of 2003 have
preferred these appeals from the elaborate judgment dated 09.02.2005
of learned single Judge  of this Court, whereby the original
petitioners, Border Wing Home Guards, were ordered to be granted all
benefits admissible to the State Government's servants with effect
from 30.7.2003 with a direction to absorb them retrospectively from
the same date. LPA No.712 of 2005 is preferred by the State of
Gujarat and the Commandant General of Home Guards Organization
against all the 610 home guards  concerned - original petitioners.
LPA Nos.788 of 2005 and 839 of 2005 are preferred from judgment dated
13.4.2005 and 16.2.2005 in SCA Nos.9434 of 2004 and 15654 of 2003
respectively. Those judgments referred and relied upon the judgment
impugned in the main LPA No.712 of 2005. LPA Nos.1709 of 2005, 204 of
2007 and 478 to 589 of 2006 are cross-appeals filed by the BWHGs
concerned from the same judgments. The original impugned judgment
being one in all the appeals and all the arguments having been
addressed on the basis of record of LPA No.712 of 2005, the parties
concerned are addressed herein, for the sake of convenience, as  "the
appellants", i.e. the State Government and the Commandant
General of Home Guards Organization (original respondents) and "the
respondents", i.e. Border Wing Home Guards (original
petitioners). 
</p>
 

 


 

<p id="p_3">2.		The
original petitioners (referred to as "BWHGs") approached
this Court with the prayers, inter alia, to direct the
appellants to evolve fair, just and reasonable  conditions of service
and grant service benefits, like fixation of pay, leave, over-time,
medical allowance, travelling allowance, retiral benefits like
provident fund, pension and gratuity and declare them as permanent
and full-time members of the Boarder Wing Home Guards with all
consequential benefits. The factual basis for the BWHGs to make those
prayers was that, border wing home guards were classified as
full-time and part-time appointees  and the original petitioners were
described as part time employees, though they were working full time,
round the clock and throughout the year. While the BWGHs were given
different designations carrying different pay scales, the so-called
part-time BWHGs were paid only basic pay plus dearness allowance in
the respective scale against their designations. Even after putting
in more than 10 to 18 years of service (in the year 2003), the
part-time BWHGs were denied parity of pay and benefits at par with
the so-called full-time border wing home guards. According to them,
they were duly recruited, selected and appointed after public notice
and physical test as well as oral and written tests.  After being
duly appointed and enrolled as part-time BWHGs, they have been
engaged in full-time duty, round the clock and throughout the year,
as fully trained personnel. Vide Government Resolution dated
04.10.1989 of the Home Department, home guards were equated with
State Reserve Police (SRP) personnel for the purpose of pay, but no
other benefits of paid holidays, leave with wages, over time, medical
allowance, travelling allowance or any terminal benefits were
accorded to part-time BWHGs. Instead, professional tax was deducted
from their salaries. The BWHGs were, throughout their many years of
service, rendering full time duties and performing various functions
contemplated by Rule 16 of the Bombay Home Guards Rules, 1953 and
were having 85 to 93% presence  in the total years of service as
BWHGs, according to  original petitioners.  Thus, even as they were
described as part-time in their enrollment orders, they were in fact
rendering full-time duties and they were usually deployed in the
border areas or other stations far from their home and family
throughout the year. Therefore, they could not engage in other
employment or work and their source of income remained the fixed
salary as BWHGs. It was the contention on behalf of the BWHGs that in
the Bombay Home Guards Rules, 1953 ("the Rules" for
short), there is no reference to any part time service. Under such
circumstances, when they were apprehensive of their disengagement by
way of punishment for demanding service benefits, they had approached
this Court in October 2001 by way of SCA No.9113 of 2001 and obtained
interim stay against termination of such BWHGs who had put in more
than two years of service. On 28.01.2003, the BWHGs concerned were
permitted to withdraw their  petition  with a view to making a
representation through the Commandant of Home Guards for ventilating
their grievances. Accordingly, while the authorities were directed to
maintain status quo as regards services of the petitioners till a
decision on the representation was made and communicated, a
representation was made in March 2003, but no decision on the
representation was communicated and service of 428 BWHGs was
terminated in breach of the aforesaid order, according to the
petition. The BWHGs heavily relied upon judgment of the Apex Court in
<a href="/doc/412020/" id="a_1">State of West Bengal and Ors. v. Pantha Chatterjee
and Ors</a>. [(2003) 6 SCC 469], before learned single
Judge as well as in appeals, particularly for the following
observations made therein:
</p> 

 


 


<p id="p_4">"16.		.......
</p><p id="p_5">Ordinarily, no doubt they could claim benefits only in accordance
with the scheme under which they were engaged. But as held earlier,
the scheme was not implemented in its terms as framed. Hence, the
distinction sought to be drawn between the part time and the
permanent BWHGs had obliterated and both worked together shoulder to
shoulder under similar situations and circumstances and discharged
same duties. Once the scheme as framed failed to be implemented as
such by those at the helms of the affairs and the part time BWHGs
were continued under the authority of those vested with such power to
continue them, it is not open to the State Government or the Central
Government to deny them the same benefits as admissible to members of
the permanent staff of BWHGs.	
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_6">"18.		In
the circumstances indicated above the High Court has rightly come to
the conclusion that so-called part time Border Wing Home Guards could
not be treated differently from the permanent staff of the BWHG. They
have been rightly accorded parity with them."
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_7">3.		As
against the above case of the BWHGs, the appellants herein stated
before learned single Judge that the representation of the BWHGs was
replied by letter dated 22.9.2003 of the Commandant General of Home
Guards, according to which the application for giving uniform
maintenance allowance to the members of BWHG was under consideration
of the Government. However, as they were governed by the provisions
of the Bombay Home Guards Act, 1947 and the Bombay Home Guards Rules,
1953, they had no right to permanency and  hence no right to parity
with  permanent employees. The Bombay Home Guards Act, 1947 ("the
Act" for short) has been enacted with a view to provide for a
voluntary organization for use in emergencies and for other purposes.
Home Guards were the persons who had voluntarily joined the
Organization to serve under the Commandant of Home Guards. Thus, it
was denied that there was relationship of master and servant between
the appellants and the home guards. The appellants herein contended
that there were four Battalions of Border Wing Home Guards
functioning in the State and each Battalion had 708 part time
voluntary home guards. The Border Wing Home Guards were a part of the
Home Guards Organization as a whole having 45,000 members. The home
guards were paid remuneration in accordance with Rule 17 of the
Rules, in the nature of honorarium, as they were not regular
government employees. According to the appellants, there were four
BWHG Battalions in Gujarat, each Battalion having six Companies. Each
Company had an authorized strength of 118 part time volunteers. All
the 610 original petitioners had submitted their applications in the
prescribed form and they were appointed as members of the Home Guards
Organization. It was denied that they were working full time, round
the clock  and throughout the year, except during emergencies.  They
were paid honoraria, according to their designation and in terms of
letter dated 10.4.2003 of Assistant Director General (Civil Defence),
Organization of Home Guards (Government of India). That letter was
addressed to the Chief Secretaries of Assam, Gujarat, Meghalaya,
Punjab, Rajasthan, Tripura and West Bengal and read as under:-
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_8">" I
am directed to say that the  amendments made vide to this Ministry's
letter of even number dated 19.2.2003 may now be read as under:
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_9">"On
embodiment  or during the periods of training, Border Wing Home
Guards volunteers  would receive honoraria equivalent to the
prescribed pay and allowances at the minimum scale appropriate to
their ranks and trades in the State Armed  Police."
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_10">3.1		It
is stated on oath by the Battalion Commandant, Ist Battalion,  Border
Wing Home Guards at Palanpur, in his affidavit-in-reply,  that the
home guards were acting as auxiliaries to the police force and none
of the original petitioners were physically stationed on the
international border, that they were disembodied from time to time
and were free to pursue their vocation. They have been equated with
State Armed Police personnel so that honoraria given to them can be
equated with their ranks as well as for sanctioning travelling
allowance. They were not recruited under the Gujarat Civil Service
(Classification and Recruitment) Rules, 1967  but were appointed on
the basis of the Home Guards Act and the Rules framed thereunder.
Under Rule 9 of the Rules,  a home guard may continue as such till he
attains the age of 55 years and hence he would not be eligible for
retiral benefits like pension and gratuity. It is averred that BWHG
strength is made up from the existing allotted strength of home
guards of the State and there is no element of permanency or
regularity attached to being appointed as BWHGs. It is admitted that
in the event of grave emergencies, like communal  riots, post Babri
Masjid demolition or other communal riots, Kargil conflict and its
aftermath, cyclone at Kandla and the Kutchch earthquake, where all
the agencies were moblized to render service and humanitarian aid,
BWHGs were deployed for a longer duration. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_11">4.		Learned
Advocate General Mr.Kamal Trivedi, appearing for the appellants,
submitted that four Battalions of Border Wing Home Guards were raised
in the State and each Battalion comprised of six Companies.  Such
Company would have 128 personnel, out of whom ten were appointed as
permanent full-time BWHGs and remaining were called  'Part-time
BWHGs'. All the members of BWHGs were governed by the Bombay Home
Guards Act and the Rules made thereunder. The BWHGs, as distinguished
from the other rural or urban home guards, were enrolled pursuant to
sanction of the President of India for raising of two BWHG battalions
in the two border districts of Banaskantha and Kutch in the State of
Gujarat, vide secret letter dated 29.6.1979 received from the
Government of India, Ministry of Home Affairs.  That letter contained
a distinct scheme for raising and deployment of two battalions of
BWHGs with specific directions about eligibility, enrollment,
expenditure, role and organizational set up of the battalions.
Referring to the scheme contained in the secret letter dated
29.6.1979, learned Advocate General submitted that the nature of
duties envisaged for part-time and full-time BWHGs  were not
comparable and the cadres and designations  were also different for
the two. He submitted that the doctrine of "equal pay for equal
work" required equivalence in duties and responsibilities which
were not established in the facts of the cases. He submitted that the
enrollment and the so-called employment of part-time home guards was
exclusively  governed by the statutory rules and there were no posts
of  permanent BWHGs which could be filled up by regularizing the
services of part-time BWHGs. He further submitted that the directions
in the impugned judgment would cause direct increase in the number of
posts with huge financial implications and such burden could not be
imposed on the State particularly when part-time BWHGs were not
regularly recruited after public notice and proper selection
procedure conforming <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_2">Article 16</a> of the Constitution.  He further
submitted that part-time BWHGs were not exploited  as alleged,
inasmuch as they were paid wages and dearness allowance  at the
minimum of the scale equivalent to similar posts in the State Armed
Police.  He also submitted that appointment of all BWHGs were subject
to the Rules of 1953 and they were required to be deployed according
to the requirements, but in fact they were not being deployed
exclusively in the border areas to work with or under the Boarder
Security Force. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_12">4.1		Learned
Advocate General relied upon the later decision of Constitution Bench
of the supreme Court in <a href="/doc/104090797/" id="a_3">Secretary, State of
Karnataka v. Uma Devi</a> [(2006) 4 SCC 1]  and emphasized
following observations made therein:
</p> 


<p id="p_13">"44.		The
concept of "equal pay for equal work" is different from
the concept of conferring permanency on those who have been appointed
 on ad hoc basis, temporary basis, or based on no process of
selection as envisaged by the rules. This Court has in various
decisions applied the principle of equal pay for equal work and has
laid down the parameters for the application of that principle. The
decisions are rested on the concept of equality enshrined in our
Constitution  in the light of the directive principles in that
behalf. But the acceptance of that principle cannot lead to a
position where the court could direct that appointments made without
following the due procedure established by law, be deemed permanent
or issue directions to treat them as permanent. Doing so, would be
negation of the principle of equality of opportunity......

<p id="p_15">4.2		Learned
Advocate General also relied upon judgment in <a href="/doc/913359/" id="a_4">State
of Manipur v. Ksh</a>. Moirangninthou Singh [(2007) 10 SCC 544],
wherein  learned single Judge of Gauhati High Court had directed the
State Government to regularize the services of home guards and to
grant them all service benefits, including pensionary benefits as
were payable to government employees holding civil posts. Division
Bench of that High Court held that learned single Judge had no power
to direct amendment of the Act and the Rules, but upheld the other
directions. The Apex Court  opined that in view of Constitution Bench
judgment in <a href="/doc/104090797/" id="a_5">Secretary, State of Karnataka v. Uma
Devi</a> (supra), the Court cannot direct regularization
in service and it followed that it had no power to  direct grant of
benefits payable to the  regular employees.  Perusing the provisions
of the Home Guards Act and the Rules, it was observed that the home
guards was meant to be a reserve force which was to be utilized in
emergencies, but it was not a service like the police, paramilitary
force or army, and there is no right in a member to continue till the
age of 55 years. The concept of home guards was of a voluntary
citizen force  as auxiliary to the police for maintaining law and
order and for meting emergencies like floods, fires, famine etc. and
for civil defence. The Supreme Court, however, observed, at the end,
that the Home Guards Act in several States appeared to have been
misused and hence the Central Government might consider not releasing
funds for the home  guards  in a       State where the provisions of
the Act were not being strictly followed. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_16">4.3		Having
produced, at the request of the Court, a list of vacancies on the
permanent set up of Armed Police Constables (Class III) in the State
since the year 1982, learned Advocate General fairly conceded that 
large number of vacancies were consistently  there,  but submitted
that availability of BWHGs  was not the reason for not filling up
those large number of vacancies. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_17">5.		Learned
senior advocate Mr.Girish Patel, appearing for the respondent BWHGs,
submitted that the present litigation arising from the impugned
judgments affected lives of 1285 BWHGs of Battalion No.1 and 2 raised
under the special Scheme conveyed vide letter dated 29.6.1979. These
guards have actually worked round the clock, far away from their
homes, for more than 20 years and for more than 300 days in a year
and ironically, they are called and treated as part-time volunteers.
He submitted that the original petitioners, i.e. 1285 BWHGs, have in
fact discharged duties  in border areas and other important places
and during emergencies. They were distinguished from the other
ordinary rural or urban home guards. These personnel were duly
selected, recruited, trained, equipped and fully armed as a third
line of defence in case of external aggression or internal
disturbance. Thus, the BWHGs concerned in this litigation were in a
class by itself and could by no stretch be branded or treated as
illegally or irregularly appointed back-door entrants in government
service. It was according to the requirement of the Scheme of 1979
that recruitment of BWHGs was restricted to border areas for their
deployment nearer to their homes and the young volunteers were
attracted by the opportunity to serve occasionally as a supplementary
source of income. However, the State Government operated the scheme
in such manner that it completely destroyed the voluntary nature of
service and the opportunities for those young men to pursue any other
vocation or even meet their family members at regular intervals. He
submitted that, by now the BWHGs concerned having practically
invested their entire working life in service of the State, denial of
even regular  pay-scale  and retiral benefits by the State would not
only impinge upon the the letter and spirit of Articles  14 and 16
but may amount to denial of right to live in the twilight years of
their later life.  He submitted that, in the peculiar facts of the
present cases, there was no question of illegal or irregular
appointments insofar as the BWHGS were recruited under and in
accordance with the special Scheme of 1979. There was no question of
creation of posts as the posts were already created for the set up
under the scheme, and the guards concerned were holding those
sanctioned posts, only with the misnomer of "part-time".
Similarly, these guards were not appointed as casual, contingent,
temporary, ad-hoc, or  contract-based employees and hence there was
no question of regularizing their services on non-extant posts.
Instead, the BWHGs concerned were assigned designations and duties
and already granted equivalence of posts in the matter of pay with
the State Armed Police under the scheme of their appointment itself. 
Their grievance arose from the stark discrimination in denying to
them regular pay scale, allowances and retiral benefits without any
legal basis or justification, even after their long services ranging
from 15 to 27  years and actually working shoulder to shoulder with
the so-called full-time BWHGs and the State Armed police. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_18">5.1		It
was pointed out on behalf of the BWHGs that even during pendency of
their petitions before learned single Judge, the appellants herein
were directed to constitute a high level committee to redress their
grievance, but such committee rejected the claim without appreciating
the grievance and without even referring to the judgment of the Apex
Court in Pantha Chatterjee (supra)
which was relied upon by the BWHGs.  He submitted that even after the
impugned judgment, the appellants were approached with offers to
waive part of the arrears with a view to ensure some financial
security for the remaining life of the BWHGs concerned. But the
appellants only offered the scheme of  absorption which allowed the
BWHGs to enter the State service afresh; completely ignoring and
obliterating the past services of 15 to 27 years. Thus, learned
senior advocate Mr.Patel made an impassioned appeal to the judicial
conscience of the Court to consider the plight of and prospect for
the BWHGs concerned, keeping in view the Preamble, the Fundamental
and inalienable human rights of the original petitioners, the letter
and spirit of the Directive  Principles of State Policy and the
Fundamental Duties of every citizen to abide by the  Constitution and
to respect the ideals enshrined in it.
</p> 
	 



 


 


 


<p id="p_19">5.2		Learned
advocate Mr.Shalin Mehta, also appearing for respondent BWHGs,
submitted that, by virtue of latest decision of the Apex 	Court in
<a href="/doc/1625942/" id="a_6">Union of India v. Parul Debnath</a> [(2009) 7 SCC
255], 	after the Constitution Bench decision in 
<a href="/doc/104090797/" id="a_7">Secretary, State of Karnataka v. Uma Devi</a>
(supra), the ratio and decision in Pantha
Chatterjee's case (supra) holds the field and
absorption in government service of BWHGs with retrospective effect
was the appropriate relief which could be and ought to be granted in
the facts of the present cases. Relying upon <a href="/doc/75171/" id="a_8">Union
of India v. Hemraj Singh Chauhan</a> [(2010) 4 SCC 290],
he submitted that the State having been conceived as a Welfare State
under the Constitution, it has to be a model employer and it cannot
ignore in its policies or governance the mandate of Articles 41 and
42 of the Constitution. He further submitted that the Scheme  now
devised by the Government was not in consonance with the ratio and
directions in Pantha Chatterjee's
case (supra), even as the ratio in <a href="/doc/104090797/" id="a_9">Secretary,
State of Karnataka v. Uma Devi</a> (supra) did not apply
in the facts of the present cases. Relying upon Constitution Bench
decision in <a href="/doc/1416283/" id="a_10">D.S.Nakara v. Union of India</a> [(1983) 1
SCC 305, he also submitted that pension as a
retirement benefit is in consonance with and in furtherance of the
goals of the Constitution. <a href="/doc/79661/" id="a_11">D.V.Kapoor v. Union of
India</a> [(1990) 4 SCC 314] was relied upon for the
proposition that pension is earned by rendering long and efficient
service, and therefore can be said to be deferred portion of the
compensation for service rendered.  He submitted that the gist of
BWHGs' grievances was stated in para 81 of the impugned judgment in
the following words:
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_20">"8.1		.........just
as some of the petitioners are  guardsmen,  there  are guards in the
full-time staff and yet both are treated unequally.  Similarly, there
are Nayaks both part-timers as well as full-timers  and  both  are 
working  in  the  same  way and yet they are treated  unequally.  
Similarly,  there  are  Havaldars  in   both   part-timers  as  well 
as  full-timers  and  yet they are  treated unequally.  This is a
gist
 of  the  petitioners' grievance  and  this is what the petitioners'
demand i.e.  de facto the petitioners are working like full-time
staff  of the Border Wing Home Guards, the petitioners  must  be  
given same treatment de jure."
</p> 


      

 


<p id="p_21">		He
further submitted that the BWHGs concerned have the fundamental right
to live with dignity and minimum means of livelihood after being
retired upon reaching the age of superannuation and the State, in
whose service they had already spent a large part of their lives, was
 duty bound to ensure that they were not just left to starve. Learned
counsel relied upon following observations of the Apex Court in its
recent decision in <a href="/doc/1613762/" id="a_12">Harjinder Singh v. Punjab
State Warehousing Corporation</a> [(2010) 3 SCC 192]:

while interpreting the provisions of the <a href="/doc/142278/" id="a_15">Minimum Wages Act</a>, 1948,
observed:
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_23">"The
anxiety on the part of the society for improving the general economic
condition of some of its less favoured members appears to be in
supersession of the old principle of absolute freedom of contract and
the doctrine of laissez faire  and in recognition of the new
principles of social welfare and common good. Prior to our
Constitution, this principle was advocated by the movement for
liberal employment in civilized countries and the Act which is a
pre-constitution measure was the offspring 	of that movement. Under
our present Constitution, the State is now expressly directed to
endeavour to secure to all workers (whether agricultural, industrial
or otherwise not only bare physical subsistence but a living wage and
conditions of work ensuring a decent standard of life and full
enjoyment of leisure. This Directive Principle of State Policy being
conducive to the general interest of the nation as a whole, merely
lays down the foundation for appropriate social structure in which
the labour will find its place of dignity, legitimately due to it in
lieu of its contribution to the progress of national economic
prosperity."	
</p> 


 


 


 


 


<p id="p_24">"23.	The
preamble and various Articles contained in Part IV of the
Constitution promote social justice so that life of every individual
becomes meaningful and he is able to live with human
dignity. The concept of social justice engrafted in the Constitution
consists of diverse principles essentially for the orderly growth and
development of personality of every citizen. Social justice is thus
an integral part of justice in the generic sense. Justice is the
genus, of which social justice is one of its species. Social justice
is a dynamic devise to mitigate the sufferings of the poor, weak,
dalits, tribals and deprived sections of the society and to elevate
them to the level of equality to  live a life with dignity of person.
In other words, the aim of social justice is to attain substantial
degree of social, economic and political equality, which is the
legitimate expectation of every section of the society. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_25">"24.	In
a developing society like ours which is full of unbridgeable and ever
widening gaps of inequality in status and of opportunity, law is a
catalyst to reach the ladder of justice.......
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_26">"30	......The
stock plea raised by the public employer in such cases is that the
initial employment/engagement of the workman-employee was contrary to
some or the other statute or that reinstatement of the workman will
put unbearable burden on the financial health of the establishment.
The courts have readily accepted such plea unmindful of the
accountability of the wrongdoer and indirectly punished the tiny
beneficiary of the wrong ignoring the fact that he may have continued
in the employment for years together and that micro wages earned by
him may be the only source of his livelihood. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_27">"31.	It
need no emphasis that if a man is deprived of his livelihood, he is
deprived of all his fundamental and constitutional rights and for him
the goal of social and economic justice, equality of status and of
opportunity, the freedoms enshrined in the Constitution remain
illusory. Therefore, the approach of the courts must be compatible
with the constitutional philosophy of which the Directive Principles
of State Policy constitute an integral part and justice due to the
workman should not be denied by entertaining the specious and
untenable grounds put forward by the employer-public or private. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_28">"42.	That
being the legal position, under <a href="/doc/1673816/" id="a_16">Article 38</a> of the Constitution, a
duty is cast on the State, which includes the judiciary, to secure a
social order for the promotion of the welfare of the people. <a href="/doc/653327/" id="a_17">Article
38 (1)</a> runs as follows:
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_29">"38.	State
to secure a social order for the promotion of 	welfare of the people-
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_30">(1)	The
State shall strive to promote the welfare of the people  by securing
and protecting as effectively as it may a social order in which
justice, social, economic and political, shall inform all the
institutions of the national life."
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_31">This is
echoing the Preambular promise. Therefore, it is clearly the duty of
the judiciary to promote a social order in which justice, economic
and political informs all the institutions of the national life. This
was also made clear in Kesavananda Bharati  by Justice Mathew at 
page 1952, para 1728 and His Lordship held that the Directive
Principles nevertheless are:
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_32">".1714...fundamental
in the governance of the country and all the organs of the State,
including the judiciary, are bound to enforce those directives. The
Fundamental Rights themselves have no fixed content: most of them are
mere empty vessels into which each generation must pour its content
in the light of its experience."
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_33">6.		Considering
the rival contentions, it clearly appears that, in the matter of
engagement of BWHGs concerned,  statutory structure is provided by
the Bombay Home Guards Act, 1947 and the Rules made thereunder, while
the mandate and the conditions of service  have come through the
Scheme of the Central Government in the year 1979. <a href="/doc/142278/" id="a_18">The Act</a> provides
for  training, deployment and control of  home guards, whereas the
Rules provide for appointment of members of home guards and limits of
age for appointment and continuance as a member. The Rules also
provide for discharge, resignation, discipline, training, functions
and duties, remuneration and compensation for the home guards.  In
short, membership of the voluntary organization of home guards
carries with it most of but not all the incidents of service.  In the
facts of the present cases, it is not the ordinary home guards
enrolled under the Act or the Rules which are under consideration,
but it is only the Border Wing Home Guards concerned, whose facts of
deployment and grievances are different, whose cases have to be
considered.  And what they really sought was not the designation of
full-time permanent home guards, but parity with the State Armed
Police in all respects, according to their equivalent rank and
designations.  
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_34">6.1		Admittedly,
two  battalions of BWHGs were raised pursuant to and in accordance
with the letter dated 29.6.1979 of the Central Government. According
to that letter, battalions were to be raised from within the belt
zone of between 5 to 50 miles along the border as far as practicable 
and no rural home guards were to be raised or retained within the
areas covered by the belt. It was to be ensured that the BWHGs were
available for  duty during emergencies both for long and short
durations in the event of call out. They had to fulfill the required
qualifications/standards and conform to the standards laid down for
the armed police battalions in the State. In order to ensure rapid
mobilization, the enrollment was to be from inhabitants of the border
districts; and for speedy raising of the battalions, permanent staff
as authorized was to be taken on loan from retired defence services
or police personnel. In the event of other  urgent utilization by the
State Government for its own purposes,  it could be resorted only
after prior clearance of the Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of
India; and the expenditure for such deployment had to be borne by the
State at 100%. Otherwise, the expenditure on the Scheme  was to be
met by Government of India at 75% on the authorised staffing pattern
and other items  as laid down in the Scheme and the remaining 25% was
to be met by the State Government. The BWHGs were to be assigned
additional  roles during periods of tension on the border to assist
in providing local security to border villages, to protect  the lines
of communication in times of emergency and to provide sub-units as
auxiliaries  to the Border Security Force in defence of the border
including patrolling along the border and  checking and preventing
infiltrators. The sanctioned strength of full-time paid and part-time
volunteers of combatants and non-combatants  were to be as prescribed
in the scheme. The full-time establishment at Platoon H.Qs.  and
Battalions H.Qs. were to be paid at the scales of pay and allowances
admissible to the State Armed Police , while the remainder on
part-time were to be given honoraria at fixed monthly rates. However,
on embodiment or during the periods of training, part-time BWHGs were
to receive pay and allowances appropriate to their ranks and trades
at par with the State Armed Police. This requirement of pay and
allowances appropriate to the rank and trade at par with the State
Armed Police was reiterated (with qualification of minimum of the
pay-scale) in the letter dated 10.4.2003 reproduced hereinabove. The
scheme also prescribed a rigorous training schedule and syllabus and
provided for advanced collective training. It is not the case of the
appellants that the BWHGs were enrolled or appointed de hors
the Act and the Rules, or in violation of the provisions of the
Scheme. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_35">6.2		Thus
a special force of BWHGs was created for a special purpose. But in
fact, and in effect, the BWHGs concerned were, for the most part,
deployed by the State Government, practically continuously as an
auxiliary to the police force, without complying with the
requirements of disengagement or disembodiment.  They were enrolled
between the years 1982 to 1995 and most of them were continuously
deployed throughout the period and thereafter, -according to the
figures stated on oath- and not denied in reply. It transpired from
the letters dated 03.2.1993 and 05.9.1997 of the Battalion Commandant
to the Company Commanders that the instructions to demobilize the
guardsman at least for 40 days in a year and at least for 10 days in
each quarter were being flouted. The appellants' own figures on
affidavit revealed that the periods of disembodiment were negligible
or nil except in early 1980s. Therefore, the inescapable conclusion
was that services of the BWHGs concerned were utilized in
substitution of or as auxiliary to the State Armed Police. The
figures of consistently large and increasing number of vacancies on
the regular set up of the State Armed Police (Class III),
particularly since the year 2000, bear testimony to the fact that the
BWHGs concerned were, directly or indirectly and wittingly or
unwittingly, deployed where the State Armed Police, if their
vacancies were filled up,  would have been employed on regular basis.
The table of strength and vacancies of State Armed Police (Class
III), as submitted by the appellants, revealed the following figures:</p><pre id="pre_2">

    16335			 	3342
 


 


 


6.3		The
</pre><p id="p_36">above facts and figures leave no room for doubting the factual
proposition that the BWHGs concerned were by no stretch employed as
part-time volunteers and their enrollment under the aforesaid Scheme
was utilized by the State Government itself as a readily available
trained and equipped mobile  force in addition to or in aid of its
depleted regular armed police force. <a href="/doc/1299491/" id="a_19">Section 5</a> of the Act provides
that a member of the Home Guards, when called out under <a href="/doc/1173610/" id="a_20">section 4</a>,
shall have the same powers, privileges and protection as an officer
of police appointed under any Act for the time being in force. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_37">6.4		The
nomenclature under the Scheme, of part-time and full-time BWHGs, was
clearly meant to have a full-time establishment to which the home
guards enrolled on part-time basis were to report on embodiment. But,
in fact, the idea of embodiment and disembodiment at certain
intervals, according to the exigencies, appeared to have been
abandoned and there appeared no justification  for the  prefix or
appellation of "part-time". Otherwise also, the words
"part-time" did not carry in the Scheme its usual meaning
of  engagement or service for a few hours every day. The words
"part-time" signified in the context engagement or
service for part or parts of the year interspersed with disengagement
or disembodiment. No sooner the BWHGs concerned were continuously and
consistently deployed on various assignments at various places for
years together, without being disembodied or relieved for any
significant period, the appellation of "part-time" became
false, perverse and baseless.  It was shown from the data and record
of the respondents that, by now, most of the BWHGs had served for the
last 15 to 27 years with more than 300 days of attendance per year in
15 years and for nearly 365 days a year in five years. Therefore, the
appellants clearly appeared to have actually used and availed the
services of BWHGs in substitution of the State Armed Police, away
from the original intention of the Scheme under which they were
enrolled. Under such circumstances, it is difficult to hold that the
State could legally deny complete equality in the matter of
employment, in the face of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution, to
the BWHGs concerned. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_38">7.		<a href="/doc/1625942/" id="a_21">In
Union of India v. Parul Debnath</a> [(2009) 7 SCALE
255 (supra), the home guards were appointed for a
period of three years, but were continuously made to perform duties
of  a regular nature. They were deployed to work under operation,
control and supervision of Andaman &amp; Nicobar Police, without any
break, and they had worked for periods ranging from 12 to 23 years.
When they voiced their grievance before the Central Administrative
Tribunal, Calcutta, the Tribunal had directed the respondent to
consider framing of appropriate Scheme
 for absorption, regularization and appointment of such home guards.
That order was challenged before Division Bench of Calcutta High
Court and that High Court, taking into consideration the decision in
Pantha Chatterjee's case (supra),
had directed appropriate authority to frame a Scheme taking into
consideration the principles laid down in Pantha
Chatterjee's case. In another petition of similarly
situated home guards, learned single Judge of Calcutta High Court
directed the respondents to consider the case of the petitioners in
accordance with the ratio in Pantha Chatterjee's
case (supra).  Special Leave Petitions filed by the
Union of India against the orders of Central Administrative Tribunal
as well as learned single Judge of Calcutta High Court  were
dismissed at the threshold on 09.08.2004 and 30.08.2004 respectively.
Thereafter, on 05.04.2005, a Scheme was framed which provided for
reservation of 20% of the vacant posts to accommodate the home guards
in a phased manner. That Scheme was challenged before learned single
Judge, but the petition was dismissed. The matter was taken to
Division Bench in appeal and the Division Bench set aside the Scheme
as well as the order of learned single Judge. The Division Bench
directed the authorities to frame the Scheme afresh in terms of the
principles enunciated in Pantha Chatterjee's case
(supra). That decision of Division Bench was under challenge before
the Apex Court. The Scheme in question had provided that, out of the
vacancies occurring in any year in all Group-D posts under the
Andaman &amp; Nicobar Administration  and in the posts of Constables
in Group-C under the Andaman &amp; Nicobar Police Department, 20%
would be earmarked for the home guards who have enrolled and
completed at least five years of continuous service and fulfilled the
eligibility conditions. The appellants before the Supreme Court
relied upon its decisions in <a href="/doc/1672467/" id="a_22">Mool Raj Upadhyaya
vs. State of Himachal Pradesh</a> [1994 Supp. 2 SCC 316],
as regards financial burden  and implications arising out of payment
of arrears; and Gujarat
Agricultural university v. Rathod Labhu Bechar
[(2001) 3 SCC 574],  and <a href="/doc/104090797/" id="a_23">Secretary,
State of Karnataka v. Uma Devi</a> (supra), to point out 
the significance of absence of specific rules. Having considered the
submissions of rival parties, the Apex Court agreed with the view
taken by the Division Bench of the High Court  and observed:
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_39">"22.	A
glance at the Scheme framed makes it very clear that the same had not
been framed in terms of the directions given by the Division Bench
and also this Court and certainly not in keeping with the decision in
Pantha Chatterjee's case (supra). As has been very rightly pointed
out in the judgment under appeal, it was the intention, both of the
Tribunal and the High Court, as well as this Court, that the 
respondent Home Guards were to be absorbed in the regular
establishment of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands and no new
appointment was required to be made.
</p><p id="p_40">It was, therefore, the further intention of the Tribunal as well as
the Courts that the absorption of the eligible respondents were to be
at one go and not in phases, as has been
sought to be suggested in the proposed Scheme. In fact, such a
procedure had neither been directed by the Tribunal nor the High
Court, nor this Court in Pantha Chatterjee's case (supra). As a
result,  the question of 100%
reservation would not arise since the absorption of the respondents
did not amount to new appointments
which could have given rise to the question of reservation. In our
view, the Division Bench has very correctly observed that the
intention of the Tribunal and the Courts was that  the
benefits to be given to the writ petitioners (respondents herein)
should be extended to all of them uniformly and without making any
discrimination.	........As a direct
consequence of the disparity in the pay structure of the respondents,
who were to be absorbed in stages, their post-retiral benefits would
be affected and would not be uniform, which was also not intended
when directions were given for framing of Scheme to absorb the said
respondents.

indicated that  while it is no doubt true that creation of posts is
the prerogative of the executive, in order to meet certain special
exigencies such a course of action has been resorted to by this Court
and in our view this is one such case where such a direction does not
need any intervention."

The
appeal was accordingly dismissed by the Apex Court. And, as held in
Parul Debnath  (supra),  the
respondent home guards were to be absorbed in
the regular establishment of the Andaman &amp; Nicobar Islands  and
no new appointment was required to be made.

<p id="p_44">8.		Even
 Constitution Bench decision of the Apex Court in <a href="/doc/104090797/" id="a_24">Secretary,
State of Karnataka v. Uma Devi</a> [(20060 4 SCC 1]
(supra)  carved an exception (para 53) for duly qualified but
irregularly appointed employees  who were continued for ten or more
years without intervention of Courts or Tribunals.  It was opined
that the question of regularization of services of such employees may
have to be considered on merits  and the Union of India, the State
Governments and their instrumentalities should take steps to
regularize, as a one-time -measure, the services of such irregularly
appointed employees who had worked for ten years or more in duly
sanctioned posts, but not under the cover of orders of Courts or
Tribunals. From the standpoint of industrial law,  employment of
workmen as casuals or temporaries and to continue them as such for
years, with the object of depriving them of the status and privileges
of permanent workmen, amounts to unfair labour practice, prohibited
under <a href="/doc/142278/" id="a_25">section 25-T</a> and punishable with imprisonment under <a href="/doc/687096/" id="a_26">section
25-U</a> of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947.  In the facts of the
present cases, the appellants clearly failed to devise and implement
a fair scheme for absorption of the BWHGs concerned in spite of three
chances to do so offered by the BWHGs and orders of the Court.

<p id="p_45">9.		Respectfully
following the directly applicable ratio of the decisions of the Apex
Court in Pantha Chatterjee  (supra)
and Parul Debnath (supra), in the
facts of the present cases, it has to be held that "once
the scheme as framed failed to be implemented as such by those at the
helm of affairs and the part-time BWHGs were continued under the
authority of those vested with such power to continue them, it is not
open to the State Government or the Central Government to deny them
the same benefits as admissible to members of the permanent staff of
Border Wing Home Guard". And, the State Government, being in
the position of employer of the respondent-petitioners, owes the
primary responsibility of  making all the  payments on account of
salary, allowances and other perquisites to them as admissible to the
permanent staff of Border Wing Home Guards. "The so-called
part-time Border Wing Home Guards could not be treated differently
from the permanent staff of BWHG".  As observed in Parul
Debnath (supra),  the BWHGs concerned were required to
be absorbed in regular establishment of the Government and no new
appointment was required to be made. The benefits to be given to the
BWHGs concerned should be extended to all of them uniformly and
without making any discrimination.  The Apex Court frowned upon such
absorption of the BWHGs as  would  affect their post-retiral
benefits. Therefore, under the peculiar facts and circumstances, the
directions contained in the impugned judgments to give to the BWHGs
concerned all benefits available to the State Government's servants
and absorb them in its service with effect from 30.7.2003, the date
of filing of the petition, are not   required to be interfered in
these appeals. In fact, the State Government has itself made a Scheme
dated 06.4.2009 for absorption of the part-time BWHGs in the regular
establishment of State Reserve Police Force (S.R.P.F.) conferring all
the benefits of pay scale, allowances etc.; but the BWHGs could not
avail of that Scheme due to pendency of these proceedings and their
claims based on very long past service.  It was pointed out on behalf
of 1285 BWHGs concerned that they stood to lose more than 30 crore
rupees of arrears on account of the appointed date of absorption
ignoring their services for the period prior to the year 2002,  and
the calculation of their retiral benefits will also be affected. That
point and grievance was not pressed expressly in consideration of the
prospects of the BWHGs getting all the benefits, with arrears,
immediately with effect from the aforesaid date. In view of the
unnecessarily prolonged pendency of these appeals, it has to be
clarified and directed, in the interest of justice, that the arrears
payable to all the 1285 BWHGs concerned in these appeals shall be
counted and calculated on the basis of their absorption in full-time
permanent service on the equivalent posts with effect from 30.7.2003
and the amounts of difference of salary and unpaid allowances due at
the end of every year, i.e. 30.7.2004,
30.7.2005, 30.7.2006
et. al, shall be capitalized and paid with interest @ 7.5% p.a. The
current wages of the BWHGs concerned shall be calculated  on the
basis of their absorption in service of the State since 30.7.2003 and
paid accordingly with all the increments and admissible allowances at
par with the State armed police. The total amounts  due as aforesaid
towards increments, unpaid allowances and arrears with interest due
upto the date of payment as also the benefits at par with the State
armed police shall be paid within two months from the date of this
order, failing which, the total amount due as on 01.06.2011 to each
of the BWHGs concerned shall have to be paid with interest @ 9% p.a.
for the subsequent period.   The other BWHGs whose petitions and
appeals are already disposed by earlier orders  and who have availed
the benefit of the Scheme of their absorption in regular service
shall not be,  as declared on their behalf by learned senior Advocate
Mr.Y.N.Oza, entitled to any relief on the basis of this judgment.
Accordingly, subject to the clarifications and directions as
aforesaid, all the appeals are dismissed and all the civil
applications made therein are disposed as not surviving, with no
order as to costs.
