Mrs.M.E.Rani Selvam, learned Additional Government Pleader, accepts notice on behalf of the first respondent and Mr.P.Paramasivadoss, learned Standing counsel for Transport Corporation accepts notice on behalf  of the second respondent.
</p>
<p id="p_2">	2. The petitioner joined the services of the second respondent Transport Corporation as a Conductor  on 01.10.1988 and at the time of retirement on 31.01.2016, he was working as Selection Grade Senior Conductor.  According to the petitioner, he is yet to be conferred with the benefits of retirement/terminal benefits such as leave salary, Provident Fund, Gratuity penal interest, computation and interest and social security scheme etc. In this regard, he has also submitted a representation dated 18.10.2016 to the second respondent. Though it was received and acknowledged by the second respondent, so far, no orders have been passed.  Hence, he came forward to file the present writ petition.
</p>

In the light of the above facts and circumstances, the  2nd respondent is directed to settle the retiral/terminal benefits to the petitioner in twelve equal monthly installments commencing from 1st June 2017 with interest at the rate of 6% per annum and in the event of default, the interest payable will become 18% per annum.
