HIGH COURT OF JUDICATURE AT ALLAHABAD
 
 

?Court No. - 71
 

 
Case :- CRIMINAL APPEAL No. - 5134 of 2019
 

 
Appellant :- Sushil Kumar @ Anil Kumar And 3 Ors.
 
Respondent :- State Of U.P. And Anr.
 
Counsel for Appellant :- Amit Kumar Srivastava
 
Counsel for Respondent :- G.A.
 

 
Hon'ble Rajiv Gupta,J.
</pre> 
<p id="p_1">Heard learned counsel for the appellants, learned AGA for the State and perused the record.
</p> 
<p id="p_2">This Criminal Appeal has been filed by the appellants with the prayer to quash the order dated 28.5.2019 passed by Special Judge SC/<a href="/doc/53524/" id="a_1">ST Act</a> Amroha under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_2">section 204</a> Cr.P.C. in complaint case No. 47 of 2017, Ashok Kumar Vs. Sushil Kumar and others, under <a href="/doc/1436241/" id="a_3">section 420</a>, <a href="/doc/1011035/" id="a_4">323</a>, <a href="/doc/555306/" id="a_5">504</a>, <a href="/doc/180217/" id="a_6">506</a> I.P.C. and under section 3(1) Da, and 3(1) Dha SC/<a href="/doc/53524/" id="a_7">ST Act</a> P.S. Hasanpur District Amroha.
</p> 
<p id="p_3">As per the allegations made in the complaint, it is alleged that on the pretext of getting the O.P. No.2 employed, the appellants has taken a sum of Rs. 50,000/- from him, however, when he did not get any employment he asked to return the said money, then the appellants abused him with the name of his caste with an intention to humiliate and intimidate him in public view and also assaulted him with kicks and fists.
</p> 
<p id="p_4">Learned counsel for the appellants has submitted that from the allegations made in the complaint and the material collected during the course of enquiry, no offence is disclosed against the appellants and the present prosecution has been instituted with a malafide intention for the purposes of harassment. He has pointed out certain documents and statements in support of his contention, as such, aforementioned impugned order be quashed.
</p> 
<p id="p_5">Per contra, learned AGA has submitted that from the perusal of the allegations made in the complaint and the material collected during the course of enquiry, prima facie offence is clearly made out against the appellants and as such, order dt. 28.5.2019 cannot be quashed.
</p> 
<p id="p_6">Moreover, all the submissions made at the bar relates to the disputed question of fact, which cannot be adjudicated upon by this Court. At this stage, only prima facie case is to be seen in the light of the law laid down by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the cases of R.P. Kapur Vs. State of Punjab, AIR 1960 SC 866, State of Haryana Vs. Bhajan Lal, 1992 SCC (Cri.) 426, State of Bihar Vs. P.P. Sharma, 1992 SCC (Cri.) 192 and lastly Zandu Pharmaceutical Works Ltd. Vs. Mohd. Saraful Haq and another, (Para-10) 2005 SCC (Cri.) 283. The disputed defence of the accused cannot be considered at this stage.
</p> 
<p id="p_7">The prayer for quashing the order dated 28.5.2019 is therefore refused.
</p> 
<p id="p_8">However, it is directed that if the appellants appear/surrender before the court below and apply for bail, their prayer for bail shall be considered and decided as expeditiously as possible after giving opportunity of hearing to both the parties.
</p> 
<p id="p_9">With the aforesaid observations, this Criminal Appeal is finally disposed of
 
Order Date :- 8.8.2019
