</pre><p id="p_27">  The   Autopsy   Surgeon   stated   that   the   death   was   due   to 

  hypovolumic shock caused by rupture of left kidney and urinary 

  bladder.   Contemporaneous document i.e. report of postmortem 

  examination Exhibit 41 corroborates the version of this witness.



  8                 Though it was suggested to this witness that rupture 

  of kidney and urinary bladder can be caused by a fall with force 

  on   projecting   substance,   this   expert   witness   has   denied   this 

  suggestion.     Even otherwise, evidence  of prosecution witnesses 

  shows that after assaulting him, Tryambak Khairnar was kept in 

  the pickup jeep of appellant/accused no.1 Jagdish Khairnar and 

  not on the tractor or trolley which accidentally went in the ditch. 

  Therefore,   I   find   no   substance   in   arguments   of   the  learned 

  Advocate for appellants/accused persons that deceased Tryambak 

  Khairnar died accidental death due to fall from the tractor and 

  trolley when it accidentally landed in the ditch.  Thus, with this 

  evidence,   the   prosecution   has   successfully   proved   homicidal 

  death of Tryambak Khairnar.

                       connection   it   would   be   appropriate   to   make 
                       reference   to   the   provisions   of  <a href="/doc/274935/" id="a_19">Section   133</a>  of   the 
                       Evidence Act which deal with the testimony of an 
                       accomplice.   It   contemplates   that   an   accomplice 
                       shall   be   a   competent   witness   against   an   accused 
                       person;   and   a   conviction   is   not   illegal   merely 
                       because   it   proceeds   upon   the   uncorroborated 
                       testimony of an accomplice. The first part envisages 
                       that   an   accomplice,   in   other   words,   a   guilty 
                       companion in crime, shall be a competent witness 
                       while the second part states that conviction is not

                       uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice. But if 
                       we   read  <a href="/doc/274935/" id="a_20">Section   133</a>  of   the   Evidence   Act   with

                       may   lead   to   certain   amount   of   confusion   and 
                       misunderstanding as to the real and true intention 
                       of the Legislature because quite contrary to what is

                       goes   to   show   that   it  was   considered   necessary   to 
                       place   the  law   of   accomplice   evidence   on   a   better 
                       107 footing by stating in unambiguous terms that 
                       according to <a href="/doc/274935/" id="a_26">Section 133</a> a conviction is "not illegal 
                       or in other words not unlawful" merely because it is 
                       founded   on   the   uncorroborated   testimony   of   an 
                       accomplice while accepting that an accomplice is a 
                       competent   witness.   But   at   the   same   time   the 
                       Legislature   intended   to   invite   attention   to 
                       illustration (b) of  <a href="/doc/731516/" id="a_27">Section 114</a>  of the Evidence Act 
                       with a view to emphasise that the rule  contained 
                       therein as well as in  <a href="/doc/274935/" id="a_28">Section 133</a>  are parts of one

                       the exercise of judicial discretion except in cases of 
                       very exceptional nature. However, the difficulty in 
                       understanding   the   combined   effect   of   the 
                       aforementioned two provisions arises largely due to 
                       their placement at two different places of the same 
                       Act. It may be noticed that illustration (b) attached 
                       to <a href="/doc/731516/" id="a_29">Section 114</a> is placed in Chapter VII of Evidence

  lifted him and put him in the jeep.   He was forced to drive the 

  tractor belonging to Tryambak Khairnar.  Then, return journey to 

  Village Kikwari started.   Approver/PW1 Deelip Birari stated that

  on motorcycle, whereas appellant/accused no.1 Jagdish Khairnar, 

  appellant/ accused no.2 Sanjay @ Satish Bhamare and PW3 Bapu 

  Bagul along with Tryambak Khairnar were in the jeep.  He stated 

  that during the return journey, as he was not knowing driving of 

  a tractor, it went in the road side ditch and it was taken out by 

  towing it by another tractor, with the help of that tractor owner 

  and his son.  That is how, as per version of this witness, they went 

  to   their   village.     Thereafter,   appellants/accused   persons   put 

  Tryambak Khairnar in the trolley.  They threatened him as well as 

  PW3   Bapu   Bagul  and  this  witness  was then  asked   to  take   the

  is sleeping in the trolley, as he had consumed liquor.

  was arrested on the next day and then, he disclosed the incident 

  to police as well as to the Judicial Magistrate First Class, Satana, 

  where his confessional statement Exhibit 24 came to be recorded. 

  This witness identified the stick and tommy to be the weapons of 

  the assault.

  14                Cross-examination of this witness shows that none of 

  the appellants/accused had given any blow on head or chest of 

  Tryambak Khairnar.  His cross-examination further shows that his 

  evidence that appellant/accused no.2 Sanjay @ Satish Bhamare 

  was assaulting deceased Tryambak Khairnar by piercing the stick 

  in his body, has come on record by way of omission.  He denied 

  that   when   the   tractor  went   into  the  ditch,  deceased Tryambak 

  Khairnar   had   a   fall   from   that   tractor   and   suffered   injuries. 

  Confession of this witness at Exhibit 26 makes it clear that this

  about the incident while in the witness box, which is in tune with 

  his   confession   Exhibit   26   recorded   by   the   learned   Judicial 

  Magistrate   First   Class,   Satana.     One   may   argue   that   the

  of   the   murder   and   therefore,   he   cannot   be   the   approver,   and 

  therefore his evidence needs to be ignored.  However, evidence of 

  this witness approver/PW1 Deelip Birari goes to show that after 

  assault on deceased Tryambak Khairnar, this witness had driven 

  the tractor and trolley belonging to deceased Tryambak Khairnar 

  and then on reaching Village Kikwari, in the trolley of that tractor 

  dead   body   of   Tryambak   Khairnar   was   loaded.     Approver/PW1 

  Deelip Birari then transported that dead body up to the house of 

  Tryambak   Khairnar   and   informed   his   wife   that   as   Tryambak

  Khairnar had consumed liquor, he is sleeping in the trolley of the 

  tractor.  That is how, this witness approver/PW1 Deelip Birari was 

  arraigned as an accused and subsequently, on tender of pardon, 

  he became prosecution witness.

  16                Now   let   us   examine   whether   this   evidence   of   the 

  approver/PW1   Dileep   Birari   is   corroborating   in   material 

  particulars by other evidence adduced by the prosecution.  PW3 

  Bapu   Bagul   claims   to   be   an   eye   witness   to   the   incident   in 

  question.  As per his version, he had hired pickup jeep of Vishwas 

  Khairnar (PW6) for selling onions at APMC market, Kalavan, on 

  19th January 2010.  He further deposed that he was undertaking 

  return   journey   to   his   Village   Kikwari   in   the   tractor   of   Ashok 

  Ahire.     Appellant/accused   no.2   Sanjay   @   Satish   Bhamare   was 

  also in that tractor.  The tractor was stopped at Village Bundhate. 

  He himself and appellant/accused no.2 Sanjay @ Satish Bhamare 

  alighted from the tractor of Ashok Ahire and the said tractor then 

  went   ahead.     PW3   Bapu   Bagul   further   deposed   that   then

  Sanjay @ Satish Bhamare along with Tryambak Khairnar (since 

  deceased) went to the shop for consuming liquor whereas, he and 

  approver/PW1 Deelip Birari waited outside.  After sometime, they 

  came out and appellant/accused no.2 Sanjay @ Satish Bhamare 

  sat in the tractor of Tryambak Khairnar.   In the pickup jeep of 

  appellant/accused no.1 Jagdish Khairnar, he himself,  appellant/ 

  accused no.1 Jagdish Khairnar and approver/PW1 Deelip Birari 

  sat.  Further return journey then resumed.



  17                As per version of PW3 Bapu Bagul, vehicles were then 

  again stopped at Kalika hotel.   Appellant/accused no.1 Jagdish 

  Khairnar, appellant/accused no.2 Sanjay @ Satish Bhamare and 

  Tryambak   Khairnar   went   in   that   hotel   whereas   he   and

  Ravindra Ahire and appellant/accused no.5 Ashok Khairnar then

  appellant/accused no.3 Ravindra Ahire caught hold of Tryambak 

  Khairnar from backside.  Appellant/accused no.2 Sanjay @ Satish 

  Bhamare  assaulted him by stick, appellant/accused no.5 Ashok 

  Khairnar   assaulted   him   by   means   of   a   tommy   and   when   he 

  intervened,   he   was threatened.   This witness PW3 Bapu Bagul 

  further   stated   that   when   approver/PW1   Deelip   Birari   tried   to 

  intervene,   appellant/accused   no.5   Ashok   Khairnar   pushed   him. 

  As   per   version   of   PW3   Bapu   Bagul,   appellant/accused   no.1 

  Jagdish   Khairnar,   appellant/accused   no.2   Sanjay   @   Satish 

  Bhamare and appellant/accused no.5 Ashok Khairnar gave two to

  and   appellant/accused   no.2   Sanjay   @   Satish   Bhamare   lifted 

  Tryambak Khairnar an put him in the pickup jeep. He also sat in 

  the pickup jeep.  PW3 Bapu Bagul in chief-examination itself has 

  stated that appellants/accused persons asked him to take care of 

  Tryambak   Khairnar,   and   therefore,   he   caught   hold   of   head   of 

  Tryambak Khairnar and rested it on his thigh.  This witness then 

  deposed   about   driving   the   tractor   of   Tryambak   Khairnar   by

  approver/PW1 Deelip Birari, despite his reluctance to do so, and 

  then landing the tractor in the ditch.   PW3 Bapu Bagul has also 

  spoken   about   seeking   help   of   two   persons   and   taking   out   the 

  tractor of Tryambak Khairnar from the ditch by means of towing 

  by   another   tractor.   He,   further,   deposed   that,   on   reaching   the 

  village,   appellants/accused   persons   namely,   appellant/accused 

  no.1 Jagdish Khairnar, appellant/accused no.2 Sanjay @ Satish 

  Bhamare,   appellant/accused   no.3   Ravindra   Ahire   and 

  appellant/accused   no.5   Ashok   Khairnar   took   out   body   of 

  Tryambak Khairnar from the pickup jeep and kept it in the trolley 

  of the  tractor.  PW3 Bapu Bagul deposed that, then, as per their 

  directions, approver/PW1 Deelip Birari had taken that tractor to 

  the   house   of   Tryambak   Khairnar.     He   further   stated   that   the 

  accused persons had threatened him not to disclose the incident 

  and   warned   him   that   he   is   Harijan   and   residing   alone   in   the 

  village   with   his   family   and   he   will   not   be   kept   alive,   if   the

  18                Cross-examination of this witness goes to show that 

</pre><p id="p_40">  he   had   not   disclosed   the   incident   to   anybody   including   his 

  brothers and neighbours as well as Police Patil.  He, however, had 

  disclosed the incident to his wife.   His statement under <a href="/doc/447673/" id="a_36">Section 

  161</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure, as seen from his cross-

  examination, was recorded on 22nd January 2010.



  19                Cross-examination   of   this   witness   further   goes   to 

  show that when he was taken at the police station, police had 

  given   two   blows   of   belt   on   his   hand   and   he   was   frightened. 

  Then, his statement was recorded.  Even on the day of recording 

  of his statement by the court, his police statement was read over 

  to him and police had directed him to depose before the court as 

  per his police statement.  With the aid of this material brought on 

  record,   it   is   argued   by   the   learned   advocate   for 

  appellants/accused   persons   that   this   witness   was   assaulted   by 

  police to extract his police statement and then he was tutored to 

  depose   before   the   court.     Hence,   his   evidence   needs   to   be

  20                In   the   matter   of  <a href="/doc/85716345/" id="a_38">Gopal   Madhukar   Bombatkar   vs. 

  State of   Maharashtra5</a>  this court has held that meeting of the 

  witness with the prosecutor prior to recording of his evidence by 

  itself will not amount to tutoring.   It is further held that if the 

  witness is made aware about his police statement and was told to 

  narrate   the   incident   properly   in   the   court,   the   same   does   not 

  amount to tutoring. Undoubtedly, the police was not justified in 

  assaulting PW3 Bapu Bagul prior to recording of his statement, 

  but that by itself does not make what he has deposed before the 

  court   as   false.     If   his   evidence   is   found   to   be   truthful   and 

  trustworthy, then, merely because the police had given two blows 

  of belt on his palm prior to recording of his statement, his entire 

  substantive   evidence   before   this   court   cannot   be   jettisoned.

  21                PW13 Ravindra Hiray is the Secretary of the APMC,

  receipt at Exhibit 74 fortifies version of PW14 Balu Bagul to the 

  effect that he along with appellant/accused no.1 Jagdish Khairnar 

  had   been   to   the   said   market   in   the   pickup   jeep   of

  Khairnar.   Evidence of approver/PW1 Deelip Birari is to a large 

  extent in tune with version of PW3 Bapu Bagul.  



  22                Both   approver/PW1   Deelip   Birari   and   PW3   Bapu 

  Bagul have spoken about forcing approver/PW1 Deelip Birari to 

  drive the tractor belonging to deceased Tryambak Khairnar after 

  assault   on   Tryambak   Khairnar   by   appellants/accused   persons. 

  Both these witnesses have stated that during the course of driving 

  of   that   tractor,   because   approver/PW1   Deelip   Birari   was   not 

  knowing   driving   of   the   tractor,   it   went   in   the   ditch.   PW12 

  Kashinath   Jagtap   is   owner   of   the   other   tractor.   He   helped   in 

  taking   out   the   tractor   of   Tryambak   Khairnar   from   the   ditch, 

  where it was landed, when it was being driven by approver/PW1 

  Deelip Birari.   PW12 Kashinath Jagtap has deposed that in the 

  night hours two persons of village Kikwari approached him and 

  requested   him   to   tow   the   tractor   on   the   road   from   the   ditch. 

  Evidence of this witness further shows that after separating the 

  trolley from the tractor, rope was tied to the tractor and it was 

  pulled by the tractor belonging to this witness, so as to make it 


  avk                                                                           34/44

  roadworthy.     Thus,   evidence   of   PW12   Kashinath   Jagtap   is 

  corroborating the version of approver/PW1 Deelip Birari as well 

  as   that   of   PW3   Bapu   Bagul   establishing   their   presence   on   the 

  scene   of   occurrence   with   the   appellants/accused   persons. 

  Therefore, I see no reason to disbelieve their version about the 

  incident in question and the material on record as indicated in 

  the   foregoing   paragraphs,   thus,   corroborates   the   version   of 

  approver/PW1   Deelip   Birari   in   all   material   particulars.   In   this 

  view of the matter, it needs to be held that the prosecution has 

  duly   established   the   fact   that   during   their   return   journey   to 

  village   Kikwari,   Tryambak   Khairnar   was   assaulted   by 

  appellants/accused persons by means of tommy and stick.



  23                The   learned   trial   court   upon   holding   that   deceased 

  Tryambak Khairnar was assaulted by appellants/accused persons, 

  has held in paragraphs 45 and 46 that the prosecution has failed 

  to   make   out   the   offence   punishable   under   <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_39">Section   302</a>   of   the 

  Indian   Penal   Code   and   the   case   is   falling   in   Exception   4   to

  out of sudden fight and the assault was in the heat of passion 

  upon a sudden quarrel and without the offenders having taken 

  undue advantage.  The State has not challenged this finding and 

  we   are   dealing   with   the   appeal   at   the   instance   of 

  appellants/accused persons.  In paragraph 35 of its judgment, the 

  learned   trial   court   has   held   that   kidney   and   bladder   are   vital 

  limbs in the body of human being and the assault was on those 

  parts which reflect intention to cause such bodily injuries, as is 

  likely to cause death.  The learned trial court further held that the 

  act was with an intention of causing such bodily injuries as are 

  sufficient to cause death of a person, and therefore, the offence is 

  one   punishable   under   First   part   of   <a href="/doc/409589/" id="a_41">Section   304</a>   of   the   Indian 

  Penal   Code.   This   finding   is   assailed   by   the   appellants/accused 

  persons by contending that the same is not in consonance with 

  the evidence made available on record.

  conducted the autopsy on the dead body. Though this witness has 

  narrated  the   external  as well as internal  injuries found on  the 

  dead   body   of   Tryambak   Khairnar,   he   has   not   stated   that   the

  26                In   the   instant   case,   let   us   examine   whether 

</pre><p id="p_48">  appellants/accused persons intended to cause death of Tryambak 

  Khairnar by assaulting him by means of the tommy as well as 

  wooden sticks.  In chief-examination itself, approver/PW1 Deelip 

  Birari has stated that the assault was only on lower part of body 

  of Tryambak Khairnar and no blows were given on upper part of 

  the body of the victim.  PW3 Bapu Bagul has categorically stated 

  in his chief-examination that after assaulting Tryambak Khairnar, 

  appellants/accused   persons   had   asked   him   to   take   care   of 

  Tryambak Khairnar during their return journey, after keeping him 

  in   the   pickup   jeep.     Evidence  of   PW3  Bapu   Bagul   shows  that, 

  therefore,   he   rested   head   of   Tryambak   Khairnar   on   his   thigh 

  during the onward journey.  Evidence on record shows that after 

  assaulting Tryambak Khairnar he was not left to die but he was 

  kept   in   the   pickup   jeep   and   he   was   taken   to   the   village   by 

  appellants/accused persons.

  in foregoing paragraphs.  The injuries were on lower part of the 

  dead   body   and   not   on   vital   parts   such   as   head   and   chest. 

  Weapons of assault were tommy and sticks.  The victim was not 

  left to die but was taken to the village and was reached to his 

  house.  The Medical Officer has not deposed about sufficiency of 

  injuries found on the dead body to cause death in the ordinary 

  course   of  nature.   Therefore, intention  cannot  be  attributed  to 

  appellants/accused persons.   The Honourable Supreme Court in 

  the matter of  Jawaharlal and Others vs. State of Punjab 6  has 

  held that merely because the blow landed on a particular spot on 

  the body divorced from the circumstances in which the blow was 

  given,   it   would   be   hazardous   to   say   that   the   first   appellant 

  intended to cause that particular injury.   In that matter, despite 

  the fact that the accused assaulted the deceased with a dragger 

  and   the   injury   was   sufficient   to   cause   death   in   the   ordinary 

  course   of   nature,   with   this   observation,   the   Honourable   Apex 

  Court   has   converted   the   conviction   form   <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_44">Section   302</a>   of   the 

  Indian   Penal   Code   to   one   under   <a href="/doc/409589/" id="a_45">Section   304</a>   (Part   II)   of   the

  inflict the said injury. Similarly, in the case in hand, the assault 

  was by sticks and tommy and the material on record does not 

  indicate that appellants/ accused persons while causing injuries 

  to the lower part of body of the deceased had intended to cause 

  his death.  No doubt left kidney and urinary of the deceased was 

  found  to  be   ruptured, but  merely  because  of this effect  of  the 

  external injury, it is not possible to infer that appellants/accused 

  persons intended to cause such bodily injury to the victim as is 

  likely to cause his death.   It cannot be said that the blows were 

  intended  to  cause such fatal injuries that  would have likely to 

  give result of death of Tryambak Khairnar.  At this juncture, it is 

  apposite to quote observations of the Honourable Apex Court in 

  the   matter   of  <a href="/doc/222636/" id="a_46">Khuman   Singh   vs.   State   of   Madhya   Pradesh7</a>

                       happened   except   this   small   incident.   Thereafter 
                       they proceeded towards their respective villages. It 
                       is   not   the   case   of   the   prosecution   that   the 
                       appellants were armed with deadly weapons. Some 
                       of them were carrying lathis, as are usually carried 
                       by the tribals in that part of the State, and had not 
                       made any special preparation for the assault. Some 
                       others had just picked up stones when the deceased 
                       was   overpowered,   and   assaulted   him.   It   is,   no 
                       doubt, true that they assaulted the deceased in such 
                       a   manner   that   the   deceased   suffered   several 
                       fractures, but the injury which caused the death of 
                       the   deceased   was   the   one   suffered   by   him   on 
                       account of the rib bone puncturing the liver. We are 
                       convinced that this injury was not intended by the 
                       appellants, and the injury suffered by the deceased 
                       on   his liver was at best  accidental. We therefore, 
                       hold that <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_47">Section 300</a> "thirdly" <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_48">IPC</a> is not attracted, 
                       and it cannot be said that the appellants intended 
                       to   cause   any   injury   to   the   liver   which   perhaps 
                       proved fatal. There is no evidence to suggest that 
                       any   of   the   other   injuries   suffered   by   him   was 
                       sufficient   to   cause   death   in   ordinary   course   of 
                       nature."
