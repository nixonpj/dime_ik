        compensation has not been tendered. It is contended that as per para 4
        of counter affidavit filed by LAC, the compensation was sent to RD.
        Counsel further submits that since the compensation has not been
        tendered to the petitioner, the case of the petitioner would be fully
        covered by <a href="/doc/185065833/" id="a_5">Pune Municipal Corporation &amp; Anr. v. Harakchand

</blockquote>
<p id="p_8">7.      Reading of the counter affidavit filed by LAC would show that the
        compensation was sent to RD. As the amount of compensation was
        not tendered to the petitioner, in our view, the case of the petitioner, is
        fully covered by the decision rendered by the Apex Court in the case
        of Pune Municipal Corporation &amp; another (supra), wherein, it has
        been held in paras 14 to 20 as under :-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">             "14. <a href="/doc/975955/" id="a_8">Section 31(1)</a> of the 1894 Act enjoins upon the
             Collector, on making an award under <a href="/doc/291273/" id="a_9">Section 11</a>, to tender
             payment of compensation to persons interested entitled
             thereto according to award. It further mandates the Collector
             to make payment of compensation to them unless prevented
             by one of the contingencies contemplated in sub-section (2).
             The contingencies contemplated in <a href="/doc/1718550/" id="a_10">Section 31(2)</a> are: (i) the
             persons interested entitled to compensation do not consent
             to receive it (ii) there is no person competent to alienate the
             land and (iii) there is dispute as to the title to receive
             compensation or as to the apportionment of it. If due to any
             of the contingencies contemplated in <a href="/doc/1718550/" id="a_11">Section 31(2)</a>, the
             Collector is prevented from making payment of
             compensation to the persons interested who are entitled to
             compensation, then the Collector is required to deposit the
             compensation in the court to which reference under <a href="/doc/1517117/" id="a_12">Section
             18</a> may be made.</blockquote>
<p id="p_9">             15. Simply put, <a href="/doc/624098/" id="a_13">Section 31</a> of the 1894 Act makes provision
             for payment of compensation or deposit of the same in the
             court. This provision requires that the Collector should
             tender payment of compensation as awarded by him to the
             persons interested who are entitled to compensation. If due
             to happening of any contingency as contemplated
             in <a href="/doc/1718550/" id="a_14">Section 31(2)</a>, the compensation has not been paid, the

              Collector should deposit the amount of compensation in the
             court to which reference can be made under <a href="/doc/1517117/" id="a_15">Section 18</a>.

             31(2)</a> with regard to deposit of the compensation in the
             court is further fortified by the provisions contained
             in <a href="/doc/1936195/" id="a_17">Sections 32</a>, <a href="/doc/1362441/" id="a_18">33</a> and <a href="/doc/779745/" id="a_19">34</a>. As a matter of fact, <a href="/doc/1362441/" id="a_20">Section
             33</a> gives power to the court, on an application by a person
             interested or claiming an interest in such money, to pass an
             order to invest the amount so deposited in such government
             or other approved securities and may direct the interest or
             other proceeds of any such investment to be accumulated
             and paid in such manner as it may consider proper so that
             the parties interested therein may have the benefit therefrom
             as they might have had from the land in respect whereof
             such money shall have been deposited or as near thereto as
             may be.
</p><p id="p_11">             17. While enacting <a href="/doc/161836307/" id="a_21">Section 24(2)</a>, Parliament definitely had
             in its view <a href="/doc/624098/" id="a_22">Section 31</a> of the 1894 Act. From that one thing
             is clear that it did not intend to equate the word "paid" to
             "offered" or "tendered". But at the same time, we do not
             think that by use of the word "paid", Parliament intended
             receipt of compensation by the landowners/persons
             interested. In our view, it is not appropriate to give a literal
             construction to the expression "paid" used in this sub-
             section (sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/1485112/" id="a_23">Section 24</a>). If a literal
             construction were to be given, then it would amount to
             ignoring procedure, mode and manner of deposit provided
             in <a href="/doc/1718550/" id="a_24">Section 31(2)</a> of the 1894 Act in the event of happening
             of any of the contingencies contemplated therein which may
             prevent the Collector from making actual payment of
             compensation. We are of the view, therefore, that for the
             purposes of <a href="/doc/161836307/" id="a_25">Section 24(2)</a>, the compensation shall be
             regarded as "paid" if the compensation has been offered to
             the person interested and such compensation has been
             deposited in the court where reference under <a href="/doc/1517117/" id="a_26">Section 18</a> can
             be made on happening of any of the contingencies
             contemplated under <a href="/doc/1718550/" id="a_27">Section 31(2)</a> of the 1894 Act. In other
             words, the compensation may be said to have been "paid"
             within the meaning of <a href="/doc/161836307/" id="a_28">Section 24(2)</a> when the Collector (or

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                                                        Page 4 of 6</span>
              for that matter Land Acquisition Officer) has discharged his
             obligation and deposited the amount of compensation in
             court and made that amount available to the interested
             person to be dealt with as provided in <a href="/doc/1936195/" id="a_29">Sections 32</a> and <a href="/doc/1362441/" id="a_30">33</a>.
</p><p id="p_12">             18. 1894 Act being an expropriatory legislation has to be
             strictly followed. The procedure, mode and manner for
             payment of compensation are prescribed in Part V (<a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_31">Sections
             31-34</a>) of the 1894 Act. The Collector, with regard to the
             payment of compensation, can only act in the manner so
             provided. It is settled proposition of law (classic statement
             of Lord Roche in Nazir Ahmad[1]) that where a power is
             given to do a certain thing in a certain way, the thing must
             be done in that way or not at all. Other methods of
             performance are necessarily forbidden.
</p><p id="p_13">             19. Now, this is admitted position that award was made on
             31.01.2008. Notices were issued to the landowners to
             receive the compensation and since they did not receive the
             compensation, the amount (Rs.27 crores) was deposited in
             the government treasury. Can it be said that deposit of the
             amount of compensation in the government treasury is
             equivalent to the amount of compensation paid to the
             landowners/persons interested? We do not think so. In a
             comparatively recent decision, this Court in Agnelo
             Santimano Fernandes[2], relying upon the earlier decision in
             Prem Nath Kapur[3], has held that the deposit of the amount
             of the compensation in the state‟s revenue account is of no
             avail and the liability of the state to pay interest subsists till
             the amount has not been deposited in court.
</p><p id="p_14">             20. From the above, it is clear that the award pertaining to
             the subject land has been made by the Special Land
             Acquisition Officer more than five years prior to the
             commencement of the 2013 Act. It is also admitted position
             that compensation so awarded has neither been paid to the
             landowners/persons interested nor deposited in the court.
             The deposit of compensation amount in the government
             treasury is of no avail and cannot be held to be equivalent to
             compensation paid to the landowners/persons interested. We
