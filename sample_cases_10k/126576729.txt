          the aforesaid embargo by providing that if during the trial of a suit to
          which sub-section (1) applies, the Court finds that the money-lender/




                                                                                         
          plaintiff does not have a licence, the Court shall, before proceeding
          with the suit, require the money- lender/plaintiff to pay penalty which
          may be three times the licence fee as specified in <a href="/doc/1907423/" id="a_28">Section 10</a> of the




                                                                 
          Act. As per sub-section (3) of <a href="/doc/1960266/" id="a_29">Section 13</a>, if the plaintiff/money-lender,
          thus pays the penalty, the Court shall proceed with the suit. This is the
          plain meaning as we can call out by a combined reading of sub-
          sections (1), (2) and (3) of <a href="/doc/1960266/" id="a_30">Section 13</a>. In sum and substance,
          therefore, the position of law as emerges from a combined reading of




                                                                
          these three provisions is that even though there is no embargo or
          prohibition as such about the maintainability or the filing of a suit with
          respect to a loan by an unlicensed money-lender, the Court in such a
          suit is precluded from passing a decree, or an order in favour of such a
          money-lender with respect to such a loan if the money-lender does not




                                                   
          hold a valid licence as per the Act, If, however, during the course of
          the trial, the Court finds that the money-lender does not have a
                                  
          licence, an obligation is cast upon the Court to call upon the
          plaintiff/money- lender to pay penalty which cannot be more than
          three times the licence fee, as prescribed in <a href="/doc/1907423/" id="a_31">Section 10</a> of the Act. The
          expression 'the Court shall, before proceeding with the suit, require
                                 
          the money-lender to pay' clearly suggests that the legislature intended
          that in every case where the suit has been instituted by an unlicensed
          money-lender, it shall be mandatory for the Court to give an
          opportunity to the money- lender/plaintiff to pay the penalty and, as
          per the provisions contained in sub-section (3) of the Act, if the
            


          money- lender avails of this opportunity and pays the penalty, the
          Court shall proceed with the suit. Undoubtedly, however, if the money-
</p>         



<p id="p_57">          lender fails to pay the penalty the Court shall dismiss the suit."
          On scrutiny it appears from the said judgment of the Division Bench as quoted
          above that the consideration of Their Lordships was whether the provisions of
          Section 13 of the B.M.L. Act will come to play when an unlicensed money-lender





          had advanced loan and filed suit for recovery of the same from the debtor. It is
          understood from the abovequoted portion of the judgment that it is always
          mandatory for the Court to give an opportunity to the money-lender/plaintiff to
          pay the penalty under sub-section (3) of Section 13 of the B.M.L. Act. The ratio
          decided in the case of Swaika Vanaspati Products Ltd. (supra), as quoted above
          has no scope to deal with the R.B.I. Act and as such the said ratio does not
          come to guide us in the context of the present matter as regards the possession





          of the certificate under the R.B.I. Act is sufficient to exonerate the plaintiff to
          obtain in the licence under the B.M.L. Act.

          learned Counsel of one of the parties. In the said judgment the Hon'ble Privy
          Council observed that the extent of the invasion by the Provinces into subjects




                                                                                        
          enumerated in the Federal List has to be considered because the validity of an
          Act can be determined by discriminating between degrees of invasion, but for
          the purpose of determining what is the pith and substance of the impugned Act




                                                                
          is also an important matter. It was also observed by the Privy Council as
          below :
</p>
<p id="p_59">          "Its provisions may advance so far into federal territory as to show
          that its true nature is not concerned with provincial matters, but the




                                                               
          question is not, has it trespassed more or less, but is the trespass,
          whatever it be, such as to show that the pith and substance of the
          impugned Act is not money- lending but promissory notes or banking ?
          Once that question is determined, the Act falls on one or the other side
          of the line and can be seen as valid or invalid according to its true




                                                  
          content."
</p><p id="p_60">          Our Hon'ble Judge of the Supreme Court came to the conclusion after
                                  
          considering the various case laws that the legislation on forward contracts must
          be held to fall within the exclusive competence of the Union under Entry 48 in
          List I. In the said judgment of Mayavaram Financial Corporation Ltd. (supra) the
          decision made in the case of <a href="/doc/1214608/" id="a_33">State of Bombay v. Narottamdas</a>,
                                 
          MANU/SC/0011/1950: [1951]2SCR51 was referred wherein the doctrine of pith
          and substance was described as follows :
</p>
<p id="p_61">          "The doctrine of pith and substance postulates, for its application, that
          the impugned law is substantially within the legislative competence of
          the particular legislature that made it, but only incidentally encroached
            


          upon the legislative field of another legislature. The doctrine saves this
          incidental encroachment if only the law is in pith and substance within
         



          the legislative field of the particular legislature which made it."
          The Hon'ble Supreme Court thus observed that the contract entered into by the
          foreman of a chit fund with the subscriber was a special contract falling under
          the Entry 7 of List III of the Seventh Schedule and the President's assent to the





          Act confirms the view of the Supreme Court.

<p id="p_63">          "The essence of a banking business is, therefore, receiving money on

          withdrawable by cheque, draft or otherwise.
</p>
<p id="p_64">          An ordinary money-lender who does not accept moneys on terms
          enabling a depositor to draw cheques upon him would not, therefore,
          be a bank or banker properly so called. The provisions of the Act
          would, therefore, apply only to the limited class of cases where the
          bank or banker allows the withdrawal of money by the issue cheques."</p><pre id="pre_5">

               deposits from third parties and lending the same are valid."
</blockquote><p id="p_66">          Thus, it is clear that the Supreme Court held the <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_35">State Act</a> which deals with
          deposits from third party and lending the same as valid. Further to that it was

          which has been introduced in the <a href="/doc/462219/" id="a_36">Reserve Bank of India Act</a>, 1934 in pith and
          substance relates to the control of credit by the Reserve Bank of India by virtue of
          its position as the central bank of the country and, therefore, falls under Entries




                                                    
          38 (RBI) and 36 (currency) of List I of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution
          and does not entrench upon Entry 30 (money-lenders and money-lending) of List

          MANU/SC/0063/1954: 1954CriLJ1322 and it was observed in that case by the
                                  
          Supreme Court that the effect of <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_39">Section 45Q</a> is not to repeal expressly or
          impliedly any of the provisions of pre-existing laws. Nor does it abrogate them.
          What it does is only to make the provisions of Chapter IIIB override the other
          laws. That being the position both the statutes namely R.B.I. Act and Bengal
          Money-Lenders Act shall remain in their respective fields and nothing is invalid. As
          we have seen from the said judgment that money-borrowing in the State in the
            

          shape of deposits from the third parties and lending the same are the same thing
          and valid, the conclusion can be drawn that the plaintiff company though having
          fortified with the certificate of the Reserve Bank must be treated as money-

<p id="p_68">          lenders under the B.M.L. Act having its business within the State of West Bengal

</p><p id="p_69">          24. Now having followed the ratio decided in the case of Swaika Vanaspati

          under sub-section (3) of the said section. And the plaintiff company is, therefore,
          directed to avail of that opportunity within a reasonable period of time and after
          having obtained such certificate on payment of statutory penalty within a period
          of three months from the date the plaintiff company may proceed with the suit

          non-Banking financial institution through Reserve Bank of India, whereas, the State
          Act (M. L. Act) provides for regulating the transaction of money lending by the
          money lenders. The business of non-Banking financial companies as defined in




                                                                                         
          Explanation II of <a href="/doc/257409/" id="a_107">Section 45I</a> provides as under:
</p>
<p id="p_140">          Any credit given by a seller to a buyer on the sale of any property




                                                                 
          (whether movable or immovable) shall not be deemed to be deposit for
          the purposes of this clause

          [(c) "financial institution" means any non-Banking institution which
          carries on as its business or part of its business any of the following




                                                                
          activities, namely:
</p>
<p id="p_141">          (i) the financing, whether by way of making loans or advances or
          otherwise, of any activity other than its own.
</p>



                                                   
<p id="p_142">          12. The aforesaid shows that the business of N.B.F.C. which is sought to be
          controlled and regulated by Chapter-IIIB of R.B.I. Act includes the financing
          whether by way of loan or advances or otherwise. Further, <a href="/doc/257409/" id="a_108">Section 45J</a> of the said
                                  
          Act enables the R.B.I. to determine the policy and issue directions to such N.B.F.C.
          which includes the matter relating to deployment of funds by N.B.F.C. The conjoint
          reading would go to show that the business of financing by such N.B.F.C. is
          regulated by the provisions of Chapter-IIIB of the R.B.I. Act. There are enabling
                                 
          power with the R.B.I. to issue such instructions and directions and they are binding
          to N.B.F.C. It can hardly be disputed that the charging of rate of interest for the
          loans or advances is not an integral component of such business. The regulation of
          such business of giving loan or advances can be equated with the moneylending.
          Therefore, the situation confronted with is that the <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_109">State Act</a> as existed prior to the
          insertion of <a href="/doc/257409/" id="a_110">Section 45JA</a> did provide for regulation of the business of
            


          moneylending by the <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_111">State Act</a>. Whereas by subsequent legislation enacted by the
          Parliament, such business of moneylending by N.B.F.C. is sought to be regulated
         



          through R.B.I. The aforesaid is coupled with the circumstance that Section 45Q of
          R.B.I. Act enacted by the Parliament provides for overriding effect, if there is
          inconsistency to any other law for the time-being in force or any instrument having
          having effect by virtue of any other such law.
</p><p id="p_143">          13. At this stage, reference to the certain observations made in the decision of this





          Court in the case of <a href="/doc/201535/" id="a_112">Sarvoday Charitable Trust v. Gujarat University</a> reported
          inMANU/GJ/0089/2008: 2008 (2) GLR 1760 would be relevant on the aspects of
          interpretation of statutes and reconciliation of the law made by the Parliament and
          the law made by the State legislature. This Court at Para 12 had inter alia observed
          as under:
</p>




<p id="p_144">          Therefore, if the interpretation of Mr. Shelat is accepted as that of
          <a href="/doc/257409/" id="a_113">Section 39</a> that it is only the University has the right to open a Post-
          Graduation Centre, then in that case, such would result into curtailing the
          operation of the laws made in the Parliament as against the State
          Legislature by virtue of <a href="/doc/257409/" id="a_114">Section 39</a> of the Act. It is by now well settled, as
          per the principles for interpretation of the statutes, that attempt on the
          part of the Court first will be to reconcile the different statutory provisions
          so as to allow them to operate independently and if such is not possible,
          the Court may read down the provisions so as to leave room for operating
          the legislature having overriding effecting and if there is a direct conflict,




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">                                                                 ::: Downloaded on - 08/07/2014 23:50:38 :::</span>

          either the provisions may be declared in operative or may be ultimately
          struck down as ultra vires. It is not in dispute that the subject of M.Ed., is
          of higher education covered by Entry No. 66, and consequently, in the




                                                                                          
          field of Parliament to make laws for regulating the education. Therefore,
          the State Legislature even if is on the statute book has to make room for
          operation of the laws made by the Parliament when covered by the




                                                                  
          subject of Parliament.
</p><p id="p_145">          14. The examination of the situation in light of the aforesaid goes to show that
          Parliament has not made the law for regulating the business of moneylending
          activity in the country by all persons including N.B.F.Cs.. But, it has made law for




                                                                 
          regulating the activities of loans and advances by specific class of persons, viz.
          N.B.F.Cs. Whereas, the State law provides for controlling and regulating the
          business of moneylending for all persons which includes the Companies registered
          under the the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_115">Companies Act</a>. The minute examination of the definition of the word
          'Company' under the M. L. Act refers to only the Companies defined under the
          <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_116">Companies Act</a>, 1913, or the Companies formed in pursuance of the Act of U.K. or




                                                    
          by Royal Charter of Letters Patent, or by an Act of Legislature of British possession.
          It does not refer to the Companies registered under the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_117">Companies Act</a>, 1956. If
          the said provisions of M. L. Act is liberally interpreted keeping in view the principles
                                   
          of purposive interpretation, it would include the Companies registered under the
          <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_118">Companies Act</a>, 1956, like the petitioners herein. If the literal interpretation is
          considered, M. L. Act may not apply to the petitioning companies which are
          registered under the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_119">Companies Act</a>, 1956, but the liberal interpretation would
                                  
          show that M. L. Act may be made applicable to subsequent companies registered
          under the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_120">Companies Act</a>, 1956. It may be that in absence of any specific law
          made by the Parliament, the provisions of State legislature of M. L. Act may be
          made applicable for such Companies. However, once the Parliament having enacted
          the law for regulating the activities of loans and advances through R.B.I. of such
            

          Companies which are covered in the definition of N.B.F.C. or which are termed as
          N.B.F.C. under Chapter-IIIB of the Act, if the application of M. L. Act to such
          N.B.F.Cs. are allowed to continue, there would be overlapping of the State
         



          legislature over the laws made by the Parliament to that extent. As observed
          earlier, when the State legislature enacted M. L. Act, for the Companies like
          N.B.F.Cs. in the present case, activities were not being regulated by any laws of the
          Parliament. It is only after the insertion of the Chapter-IIIB, more particularly after
          1997 by insertion of <a href="/doc/257409/" id="a_121">Section 45JA</a>, the regulation is made and business is





          controlled in the field of credit by such N.B.F.Cs. through R.B.I. As observed earlier,
          the said provisions of Chapter-IIIB applies with non-obstante clause as provided
          under Section 45Q of R.B.I. Act. Therefore, if provisions of Chapter IIIB of R.B.I.
          Act is allowed to operate qua N.B.F.Cs. so far as relating to moneylending with the
          application of M. L. Act for moneylending by such N.B.F.Cs., not only the
          anomalous situation may arise, but there would also be conflict of both the laws
          qua applicability of the Companies which are N.B.F.Cs. However, Chapter-IIIB of





          the R.B.I. Act applies to only Companies which are N.B.F.Cs., whereas, M.L. Act
          applies to all Companies. Therefore, in order to reconcile the situation, the
          provisions of M. L. Act and more particularly <a href="/doc/257409/" id="a_122">Section 4</a> providing for the definition
          of the Companies deserves to be read down to the extent that the Companies
          which are N.B.F.Cs. and covered and regulated by the provisions of Chapter-IIIB of
          the R.B.I. Act, would not be covered in the definition of Companies under M. L. Act.
          The aforesaid appears to be just and proper in order to reconcile both the statutes
          allowing them to operate instead further examining the constitutional validity of
          the M. L. Act and more particularly the definition clause as provided under
          <a href="/doc/622145/" id="a_123">Section 2(4)</a> in light of the specific law made by the Parliament by insertion of
          Chapter-IIIB under R.B.I. Act.</p><pre id="pre_10">

</pre><p id="p_146">           15. Even otherwise also, as observed earlier, the State legislature has to make
           room for enforceability of the laws made by the Parliament. It is not the case of the
           State that the subject of money lending is exclusively under the State List and the




                                                                                          
           Parliament has no competence to enact the law for regulating the business of the
           Companies like N.B.F.Cs. Therefore, under these circumstances, if the laws made
           by the Parliament is to operate over the earlier laws made by the State legislature,




                                                                  
           it would be reasonable to hold that the Companies which are covered under
           Chapter-IIIB of R.B.I. Act, would not be falling under the definition of the word
           Company under Section 2(4) of the M. L. Act.

           Constitution provides for making room for operation of laws made by the
           Parliament for a particular class of Companies over the State legislature, its effect
           cannot be diluted nor can be dissected on such contention as sought to be
           canvassed. Therefore, leaving the State Government to draw the attention of R.B.I.
           for making appropriate representation for such purpose, and expecting the R.B.I.
           to play proactive role as per the provisions of Section 45JA of R.B.I. Act, no further

          2013 has held that since the documents which was executed out of Maharashtra
            

          and stamp duty was already paid on such documents, according to the rates
          prevailing in that State, as and when the said document is received in this State,
          stamp duty can be paid within three months and thus reliance on such document
         



          can be placed in proceedings under <a href="/doc/257409/" id="a_127">section 9</a> at this stage. This court has also
          considered the similar provisions in that matter providing obligations on the part of
          the borrower to pay stamp duty. In my view, since both parties have acted upon
          loan agreements as well as deed of guarantee and since it was obligation on the
          part of the respondents to pay requisite stamp duty and having committed default,





          respondent cannot raise such objection in this proceeding. The judgment of the

          since it was obligation on the part of the respondent to pay such deficit if
          any, respondent cannot raise such objection before this court. In my view
          the judgment of Supreme Court in case of SMS Tea (supra) and order




                                                                                         
          passed by Division Bench in case of Lakdawala Developers (supra) would
          thus not apply to the facts of this case. Learned Single Judge of this court
          in case of Marine Container (Supra) has held that even if a document is




                                                                 
          insufficiently stamped, it cannot be brushed aside at the stage of granting
          interim relief. Deficit if any can be paid by the parties as per provisions of
          the agreement.

          3.2 read with clause 19.1 clearly provides that repayment of the loan installment
          had to be paid at the corporate office of the petitioner which is admittedly situated
          at Mumbai.
</p><p id="p_151">          16. In paragraph (29) of the petition, it is averred by the petitioner that corporate
          office of the petitioner is situated at Mumbai where the petitioner has sanctioned




                                                   
          and disbursed the loan facility to the respondent no. 1. Respondent no. 1 has
          executed demand promissory note at the registered office of the petitioner at
          Mumbai. It is stated that respondents had agreed and undertook to repay the loan
                                   
          amount at the corporate office of the petitioner at Mumbai. There is no affidavit in
          reply controverting the averments. This part of the cause of action has admittedly
          arisen at Mumbai. This court has thus jurisdiction to entertain this petition under
          <a href="/doc/1120409/" id="a_129">section 9</a> of the Arbitration and <a href="/doc/1306164/" id="a_130">Conciliation Act</a>, 1996. There is no substance in the

          particulars about the default alleged to have been committed by the respondent is
          concerned, on perusal of the petition, it indicates that the petitioner has given
            

          details of the default committed by the respondents as well as break up of the
          amount claimed. Amount claimed by the petitioner as due from respondents which
          would be subject matter of arbitration is stated to be comprising of installment of
         



          Rs. 5,99,394/-, compensation charges, cheque bouncing charges and further loan
          installment with further compensation. A perusal of the demand notice also clearly
          discloses the nature of default committed by the respondents and the amount
          claimed to be due. Particulars of claim annexed to the petition also indicates the
          breakup of the amount due. There is thus no substance in the submission of learned





          counsel appearing for the respondents that petition is devoid of particulars. Upon
          making query, learned counsel for the respondent admits that it is not the case of
          the respondents that the respondents have not committed any default in making
          payment of the installment."

            appellant was that the Bombay High Court has no jurisdiction to take the award
            on file or to issue any process in connection with it. That was a case under the
            <a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_136">Arbitration Act</a>, 1940. The High Court in its impugned judgment has upheld the
            jurisdiction of the Bombay High Court on the ground that the appellant, who is
            in the position of a defendant, has one of its places of business at Bombay. The
            submission of the appellant relying upon the explanation to Section 20(a) of

            has also a subordinate office at such place, the Court at that place also got
            jurisdiction. Reliance was placed on the decision of the Supreme Court in
                                    
            <a href="/doc/1548537/" id="a_137">Hakam Singh v. Gammon (India) Ltd</a>. MANU/SC/0001/1971: [1971]3SCR314 ,

            applies to the proceedings under the <a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_139">Arbitration Act</a> by virtue of <a href="/doc/28932/" id="a_140">Section 41</a> of

            connection with arbitration including taking on file an award is accordingly
            governed by the provisions<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_141"> of the Code</a> of Civil Procedure. Repelling this
            submission of the appellant the Bench held that under Section 120 of the Civil
            Procedure Code, Sections 16, 17 and 20 of the Civil Procedure Code do not
            apply to a High Court in the exercise of its original civil jurisdiction. Jurisdiction
            

            of the Bombay High Court to entertain a suit under its ordinary original civil
            jurisdiction is determined by Clause 12 of the Letters Patent of the Bombay
            High Court. Under Clause 12 of the Letters Patent, a place where the
         



            defendant, or each of the defendants where there are more than one, at the
            commencement of the suit, carry on business would be a place where the
            Court has jurisdiction. Therefore, it was held that under Clause 12 of the
            Letters Patent of the Bombay High Court, the Bombay High Court would have
            jurisdiction over the subject matter of the dispute in that case because the





            appellant did carry on business in Bombay. In the second case, namely., <a href="/doc/1302364/" id="a_142">Jindal
            Vijaynagar Steel (JSW Steel Ltd.) v. Jindal Praxair Oxygen Co. Ltd</a>. (supra) the
            appellant sought reconsideration of the decision made in Food Corporation of
            India (supra) on the ground that it was erroneous and contrary to the decision
            of a three Judge Bench in <a href="/doc/1695101/" id="a_143">Patel Roadways Ltd. v. Prasad Trading
            Co</a>. MANU/SC/0280/1992. Dismissing the appeal the Supreme Court held that
            for the purpose of determining the original civil jurisdiction of the Bombay High





            Court, the provisions of Section 20 of the CPC have been specifically excluded
            and have no application. Only the provisions of Clause 12 of the Letters Patent
            are required to be considered to determine the jurisdiction of the Bombay High
            Court. Under Clause 12 of the Letters Patent, the Bombay High Court would
            have jurisdiction to entertain and try an arbitration petition even if no cause of
            action has arisen within its jurisdiction, provided the respondent has an office
            at Bombay. It is clearly seen that the question as to whether Clause 12 leave
            was necessary for filing an application under the <a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_144">Arbitration Act</a> was not
            considered in either of these cases.

</p><p id="p_155">           18. Lastly, learned Counsel appearing for the respondents drew our attention to
           the judgment of a Division Bench of the Bombay High Court in Devidatt v.
           ShriramMANU/MH/0157/1931where the Bench held that obtaining of leave




                                                                                          
           under Clause 12 is a condition precedent to the entertainment by Bombay High
           Court of a suit in which the cause of action arises in part outside the original
           jurisdiction and that the condition is not one which it is competent for a Court




                                                                 
           to ignore or for the parties to waive. It was further held that the words
           "empowered to receive" in Clause 12 mean that the Court on the ordinary
           original civil jurisdiction has no jurisdiction even to receive a plaint where a
           part of the cause of action only shall have arisen within the local limits of its
           jurisdiction unless leave of the Court shall have been first obtained.
</p>



                                                                
<p id="p_156">           19. We have given our anxious thought to the submissions made at the Bar
           and the decisions cited before us. We are unable to agree with the view taken
           by the learned Judge that in order to maintain an application under the Act, it
           is a precondition that the leave under Clause 12 of the Letters Patent should
           have been obtained. Learned Judge has followed the Division Bench judgment
           of the Kolkata High Court in MANU/WB/0008/1984and the judgment of




                                                    
           Rebello, J. in . The attention of the learned Judge was not drawn to the later
           decision of the Kolkata High Court in MANU/WB/0067/1986: AIR1986Cal338 .
           Moreover, the learned Judge was much concerned and swayed by the words 'if
                                   
           the same had been the subject matter of the suit' appearing in <a href="/doc/622145/" id="a_145">Section 2(i)</a>
</p><p id="p_157">           (e) of the Act. According to the learned Judge the leave would be necessary in
           case this Court has jurisdiction over the part of the cause of action only and as
           no suit could be filed without leave, no application under the Act under the
                                  
           similar circumstances could be entertained without leave under Clause 12 of
           the Letters Patent. The analogy of 'suit' given in <a href="/doc/622145/" id="a_146">Section 2(i)(e)</a> of the Act only
           gives us guideline to find out the right court. The word 'suit' acts as an
           indicator and points out which court will be competent court to entertain the
           application under the Act. Section2(i)(e) does not treat an 'application' under
            

           the Act as a 'suit' and the application under the Act remains an application. As
           a matter of fact, if a civil suit is filed covering the subject matter of an
           arbitration agreement, the Act makes it obligatory for the Court to refer the
         



           parties to arbitration in terms of the arbitration agreement. Therefore, it cannot
           be contended that the Act intended that an application under the Act and the
           civil suit should be treated on the same footing. It has been consistently held
           that the applications under the <a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_147">Arbitration Act</a> cannot be equated with civil suit.

    addressed to the petitioner having its corporate office at Mumbai. The Promissory note has been

<p id="p_164">    24.    A Division Bench of Madras High Court, in case of Dynasty Developers Pvt. Ltd.
</p>
<p id="p_165">    (supra), has held    that   the analogy of suit given in <a href="/doc/738672/" id="a_157">section 2(1)(e)</a> of the Arbitration &amp;

    <a href="/doc/1306164/" id="a_158">Conciliation Act</a>, 1996 only gives guideline to find out the right court. The word "suit" acts as an




                                                      
    indicator and points out which forum be the competent court to entertain the application under
                                     
    the Act. <a href="/doc/738672/" id="a_159">Section 2(1)(e)</a> does not treat an application under the Act as a suit and the application

    under the Act remains an application. It is held that if a civil suit is filed covering the subject
                                    
    matter of the arbitration agreement, the Act makes it obligatory for the court to refer the parties

    to arbitration in terms of the arbitration agreement and thus it cannot be contended that the Act
            


    intended that an application under the Act and the civil suit should be treated on the same
         



    footing. It is held that the procedure for obtaining of leave is applicable only to a suit and not to

    an application under the <a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_160">Arbitration Act</a>. Since part of the cause of action has arisen within the





    jurisdiction of the court, application under the <a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_161">Arbitration Act</a> can be instituted in that court and

    in that event leave under clause 12 of the Letters Patent is not necessary. I am in respectful

    agreement with the views expressed by the Division Bench of the Madras High Court in case of





    Dynasty Develops (supra). The submission of the learned counsel on the issue of jurisdiction of

    this court is accordingly rejected.

    difference between the stamp duty already paid in the state in which such document is executed

    of the Maharashtra Stamp Act.       Statement made by the learned counsel appearing for the





    petitioner that the loan documents have not been received in the state of Maharashtra is

<p id="p_173">    30.    It is not in dispute that in the loan agreement as well as in the deed of guarantee

    arbitration agreement is provided. In the deed of guarantee there is reference to the loan




                                                                  
    agreement. Clause 18.1 of the loan agreement provides for arbitration. In respect of all questions,

    dispute or difference of claims arising between the parties or any of them touching or concerning

    the said loan agreement or other loan documents, or any condition contained therein as to the




                                                     
    rights, duties, liabilities of parties thereto or any of them. Under the said loan agreement, 'Loan
                                    
    documents' is defined under clause 1.8. Under the said definition the loan documents, means the

    loan agreement with relevant schedules, offer letter issued by the lender to the borrower, deed of

    be required by the lender to be executed by the borrower. It is thus clear that the deed of
            


    guarantee is also part of the loan document. In my view the dispute between the petitioner and
         



    the guarantor also can be referred to arbitration not only under the deed of guarantee but also

    under clause 18.1 of the loan agreement. Be that as it may, the deed of guarantee is executed





    pursuant to and so as to secure the repayment of the loan granted under the loan agreement, the

    petitioner is entitled to invoke arbitration agreement under both the documents. Both the disputes

    being interwined can be referred to the same arbitrator. There is thus no merit in the submission





    of the learned counsel appearing for respondent no.1 and 2 that the notice issued by the

    petitioner invoking arbitration agreement does not indicate as to which arbitration agreement is

    invoked and what dispute is proposed to be referred to arbitration.

    conflict of both the laws qua applicability of the companies which are non banking finance

    companies. It is held hat chapter IIIB of the RBI Act applies to only companies which are non





    banking finance companies whereas Money Lending Act applies to all companies. It is held that

    if the laws held by the Parliament is to operate the earlier laws made by the State Government, it

    would be reasonable to hold that the companies which are covered under chapter IIIB of the
