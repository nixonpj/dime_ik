                      from the date of receipt of a copy of this order. Meanwhile that the accused

                      Court by order dated 21.03.2019, while granting bail to the petitioner had

                      directed the trial Court, namely the Mahila Court, Chennai, to immediately

                      within a period of two months from the date of receipt of a copy of this order.

                      respondents have not filed the final report so far and thereby the petitioner is
