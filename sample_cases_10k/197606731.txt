                   his body. Hence, he filed a petition in M.C.O.P.No.155 of 2015 on the file of the

                   Special District Court (Motor Accident Claims Tribunal), Trichy,                 claiming

                   documentary evidence, has awarded a sum of Rs.7,33,737/- as compensation.

                   Miscellaneous Appeal has been filed.
</p>
<p id="p_5">

</p><p id="p_6">                             2. The learned counsel appearing for the claimant/appellant submitted

                   that though the salary certificate issued by P.W.8 was produced by the claimant,

                   wherein, the salary of the injured was stated as Rs.10,000/-, the Tribunal has

                   refused to accept the same and fixed the notional income of the injured at

                   Rs.8,000/- p.m. In the accident, the claimant had sustained fracture injuries in D1

                   to D3 spinal cord cervical bone in C3, C4 and C7, due to which, he could not drive

                   the vehicle and hence, he totally lost his avocation. Therefore, his loss of income

                   should be considered as 100%. Though the disability certificate has been marked

                   as Ex.P18, which shows the disability of the injured at 55%, the Tribunal has taken

                   the percentage of disability at 50% and awarded the lumpsum of Rs.2,50,000/-

                   towards partial permanent disability, pain and suffering.     The Tribunal, while

                   determining the compensation towards partial permanent disablement, ought to

                   have adopted the multiplier method as held by the Hon'ble Apex Court in <a href="/doc/837924/" id="a_2">Sarla

                   Verma and others vs. Delhi Transport Corporation and another</a> reported in

                   2009 (6) SCC 121. But the Tribunal had failed to do so. Hence, the compensation

                   awarded by the Tribunal is very low and the same has to be enhanced.

</p><p id="p_7">                                3.   The learned counsel appearing for the 2nd respondent Insurance

                Company contended that the Tribunal, after considering the relevant documents,

                has awarded the lumpsum amount of Rs.2,50,000/- towards partial permanent

                disability and pain and suffering, which is just and reasonable.       Therefore, no

                interference is required.
</p>
<p id="p_8">

</p><p id="p_9">                                4. A perusal of the award passed by the Tribunal shows that while

                determining compensation towards partial permanent disablement, the Tribunal

                failed to adopt multiplier method as held by the Hon'ble Apex Court in Sarla

                Verma's case. Admittedly, the Court below fixed the notional income of Rs.8,000/-.

                The Hon'ble Supreme Court in Syed Sadiq's case (reported in 2014 (2) SCC 735),

                fixed the notional income for a Vegetable Vendor at Rs.6,500/- for the accident that

                occurred in the year 2008. In the present case, the accident had occurred in the

                year 2014 and the injured was working as a Driver at the time of accident.

                Therefore, the Tribunal has applied its mind and rightly fixed the notional income,

                by taking into consideration of the fact that the cost of living has been increasing

                day-by-day. However, the Tribunal has awarded a sum of Rs.2,50,000/- towards

                partial permanent disability and pain and suffering, which is not fair and reasonable.

                Therefore, this Court is inclined to apply the multiplier method as held by the

                Hon'ble Apex Court in Sarla Verma's case. Since the claimant was aged about 28

                years at the time of accident, the correct multiplier to be adopted is 17. Therefore,

                this Court is inclined to award compensation by applying the multiplier method as

                held in Sarla Verma's case (cited supra), by taking the notional income of Rs.

                8,000/- as determined by the Tribunal, which is just and fair. Since the age of

                   injured
http://www.judis.nic.in      was 28 years, the multiplier to be adopted is 17.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                3/6</span>
                                                                                          CMA(MD)No.532 of 2019


</p><p id="p_10">                                 5. While applying the multiplier method, this Court is inclined to decide

                   one more issue with regard to the functional disability.



</p><p id="p_11">                                 6. The disability certificate was issued by the doctor and the same was

                   marked as Ex.P18 and x-ray was marked as Ex.P19.               Though the disability was

                   issued by a doctor, that doctor has not treated the injured. Hence, this Court is

                   inclined to take 25% as functional disability for the purpose of calculating

                   compensation. Considering the age of the injured and also considering the nature

                   of disability sustained by the injured, as per the dictum laid down by the Hon'ble

                   Apex Court in Pranay Sethi's case, this Court is inclined to add 40% of the amount

                   towards future prospects.        Accordingly, the compensation towards disability is

                   determined at Rs.5,71,200/- (Rs.8000/- + 40% x 12 x 17 x 25%).



</p><p id="p_12">                                 7.    Considering the nature of injuries sustained by the claimant, this

                   Court is inclined to award a sum of Rs.75,000/- separately towards pain and

                   sufferings.
</p>
<p id="p_13">

</p><p id="p_14">                                 10. Asfaras the compensation with regard to the reimbursement of the

                   medical expenses, loss of income for six months and loss of amenities is

                   concerned, this Court is of the view that the Tribunal has awarded just

                   compensation on those heads and therefore, the same is hereby confirmed.



</p><p id="p_15">                                 11.    Accordingly, the compensation awarded by the Tribunal stands
