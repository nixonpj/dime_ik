                         was alleged to be due and inspite of several verbal/

                         written request the Petitioners did not pay the said

                         Petitioner No.1 replied on 04.08.2011 denying the claim

                         of the Opposite Party No.2.

        complainant Company was examined on solemn affirmation and in

        course of enquiry conducted under <a href="/doc/1149595/" id="a_5">section 202</a> Cr.P.C. two witnesses,

        namely, Brahma Nand Singh and Ashok Kumar Singh were

        examined in support of the complaint. After examining the Director

        of the complainant company and its witnesses, the Magistrate

        summoned the Petitioners under <a href="/doc/1827798/" id="a_6">section 204</a> Cr.P.C. finding a prima

        facie case to be made out under <a href="/doc/1436241/" id="a_7">section 420</a> IPC.
</p>
<p id="p_26">        4.               Mr. Vindhya Keshri Kumar, learned Senior Counsel

        appearing on behalf of the Petitioners submitted that the Petitioner

        No.1 a Company incorporated under the <a href="/doc/257409/" id="a_8">Indian Companies Act</a>, 1956

        builds, owns and operates telecommunication towers, optic fiber

        cable network and related assets; and provides these passive

        infrastructure assets on a shared basis to wireless and other

        communications service providers, as well as to non-communications

        customers under long term contracts. The Petitioner No.2 at the

        relevant time was a Director of the Petitioner No.1 and the Petitioners

        No.3 to 10 were not the employees of the Petitioner No.1 at the

        relevant point in time. He has submitted that the correct fact is that

        even though the Opposite Party No.2 had been issued various work

        orders, it had not satisfactorily completed them. The Opposite Party

        No.2 was informed of the various shortcomings of the works being

        performed by it vide letters dated 21.03.2009, 13.11.2009,

        04.01.2010, 11.02.2010, 26.02.2010 and 25.03.2010. However, the
 Patna High Court Cr.Misc. No.10884 of 2012 dt.28-09-2015

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                          5/18</span>




        Opposite Party No.2 did not take corrective actions required as per

        the letters. He has further contended that on account of sheer

        negligence towards its work and also the slow pace, the Petitioner

        No.1 was suffering major losses and therefore the Opposite Party

        No.2 was responsible for the losses suffered by it. The Opposite Party

        No.2 with a view to conceal its own misdeeds during the business

        relationship sent a legal notice dated 18.07.2011 to the Petitioners

        demanding a sum of Rs.36,99,819.84 without any basis which it

        alleges to be due. The Petitioner No.1 had written several times and

        spoken over the phone to either return the materials given to the

        Opposite Party No.2 for the works allotted or account for it, in the

        absence of which the Petitioner No.1 would be constrained to deduct

        the amount of the materials from the bills of the Opposite Party No.2.

        He further submits that the material worth Rs.28,63,855/- had not

        been accounted for by the Opposite Party No.2. Hence, the Petitioner

        No.1 deducted Rs.28,63,855/- from the amount payable by the

        Petitioner No.1 and arrived at the balance amount of Rs.17,80,845/-

        which is payable and due by the Opposite Party No.2. The Petitioner

        No.1 in its reply dated 04.08.2011 claimed Rs.17,80,845/- as an

        amount due and payable by the Opposite Party No.2. The Petitioner

        No.1 subsequently sent reminder to the Opposite Party No.2 for

        payment of Rs,17,80,845/- on 5th October, 2011. On receipt of the

        reply to the legal notice dated 04.08.2011 and the reminder for
 Patna High Court Cr.Misc. No.10884 of 2012 dt.28-09-2015

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                          6/18</span>




        payment dated 05.10.2011, the Opposite Party No.2 replied the same

        by letter dated 27.10.2011. The Petitioner No.2 thereafter sent

        reminders for payment vide letters dated 22.11.2011 and 21.12.2011,

        however, the Opposite Party No.2 chose not to pay the amount due

        and with malicious intent initiated criminal proceeding which is

        nothing but an abuse of the process of law.

        examined in course of enquiry under <a href="/doc/1149595/" id="a_9">Section 202</a> Cr.P.C. The case of

        the balance outstanding. He has submitted that even if the entire

        Opposite Party No.2. He has submitted that the entire complaint is

        Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the Opposite Party No.2 has

        submitted that a sum of Rs.36,99819.84 was due on the Petitioners

        and inspite of several verbal/written request, the Petitioners failed to

        pay the said final settlement amount. He submits that the officers of

        the Petitioner No.1 visited the office of the Complainant-Opposite

        Party No.2 and induced the complainant to do civil contract work for

        the accused Company. They also assured the complainant that there is

        a very good margin and profit possibility if the complainant would

        start the work of making mobile tower and believing the

        representations/assurance given                by   the accused   persons   the

        complainant started the work assigned by the accused persons. He has

        submitted that necessary factual foundation constituting an offence

        under <a href="/doc/1436241/" id="a_10">section 420</a> IPC has been made in the complaint and simply

        because of existence of civil remedy in respect of the dispute arising

        from the breach of contract, the proceeding should not be quashed.

        He has further contended that a given set of facts may make out a

        purely civil wrong or a purely criminal offence or a civil wrong as

        also a criminal offence. According to him, in the present case the
 Patna High Court Cr.Misc. No.10884 of 2012 dt.28-09-2015

        allegations made make out a civil wrong as also a criminal offence.

        He has submitted that the crux of constituting an offence under

        <a href="/doc/1436241/" id="a_11">Section 420</a> IPC is the intention of the person who induces the victim

        and not the nature of the transaction which would become decisive in

        inferring whether there was an offence or not. In the present case, the

        complainant has stated that he was induced to believe that the accused

        persons would make payments after the execution of work, but the

        complainant realized latter that the accused after taking the works

        from it, failed to make full and final payment. He submits that the

        intention of the accused was not honest right from the beginning and

        hence the ingredient of the offence punishable under <a href="/doc/1436241/" id="a_12">Section 420</a> IPC

        is clearly attracted.

        out civil engineering works for it on being induced by the officers of

        and work was done by the complainant Company. However, the case

        of the complainant is that even though it completed the works as per

        the work orders, all payments were not released and Rs.36,99,819.84

        work completed and, therefore, it cannot be said that the accused

        held as under :-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_6">                           "15. In determining the question it has to be kept in
                            mind that the distinction between mere breach of
                            contract and the offence of cheating is a fine one.
                            It depends upon the intention of the accused at the
                            time of inducement which may be judged by his
                            subsequent conduct but for this subsequent
                            conduct is not the sole test. Mere breach of
                            contract cannot give rise to criminal prosecution
                            for cheating unless fraudulent or dishonest
                            intention is shown right at the beginning of the
                            transaction, that is the time when the offence is
                            said to have been committed. Therefore it is the
                            intention which is the gist of the offence. To hold a
                            person guilty of cheating it is necessary to show
                            that he had fraudulent or dishonest intention at the
                            time of making the promise. From his mere failure
                            to keep up promise subsequently such a culpable
                            intention right at the beginning, that is, when he
                            made the promise cannot be presumed."

                             of the exemption certificate. The conduct of the
                             GCS clearly indicates that there was no fraudulent

                             intention, the question of committing offence
                             under <a href="/doc/1436241/" id="a_23">Section 420</a> of the Indian Penal Code does
                             not arise. We have read the charge-sheet as a

                             promise or misrepresentation. Nothing has been
                             said on what those misrepresentations were and
                             how the Ministry of Health was duped and what

                             not be attributed any mens rea of evasion of

                             irretrievable break down of marriages/families.
                             There is also an impression that if a person could
                             somehow be entangled in a criminal prosecution,
                             there is a likelihood of imminent settlement. Any

<p id="p_46">        20.              In Indian Oil Corporation (Supra), the Supreme Court

        further observed that "while no one with a legitimate cause or

        unwarranted and his remedy lies only in civil law, should himself be

        made accountable, at the end of such misconceived criminal

        proceedings, in accordance with law. One positive step that can be

        taken by the courts, to curb unnecessary prosecutions and harassment

        of innocent parties, is to exercise their power under <a href="/doc/173363/" id="a_27">section 250</a>

        Cr.P.C. more frequently, where they discern malice or frivolousness

        or ulterior motives on the part of the complainant. Be that as it may."

                             to be exercised with great care. In exercise of its
                             jurisdiction the High Court is not to examine the
                             matter superficially. It is to be seen if a matter,
                             which is essentially of a civil nature, has been
                             given a cloak of criminal offence. Criminal

                             court has to exercise a great deal of caution. For
