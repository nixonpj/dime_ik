</p>
<p id="p_4">           Since all the three appeals arise out of a common

judgment, with the consent of the parties, those were heard

analogously and disposed of by this common judgment.

</p><p id="p_5">2.         The prosecution case, as per the first information

report submitted by Ramesh Kumar Agrawalla (P.W.2) before the

officer in charge of Dhanupali Police Station on 03.02.2008 is

that he had a jewellery shop in the name and style of M/s.

Jewellery World at V.S.S. Marg, Sambalpur which he was

operating along with his brother Ashok (P.W.37), Naresh (P.W.1)

and his nephew Binod (P.W.31).
</p>
<p id="p_6">           It is stated in the F.I.R. that on 03.02.2008 at about

3.00 p.m. two customers were selecting some gold ornaments

for purchase in the first floor of the shop and at about 4.00 p.m.

two other customers came and asked for silver coins. The
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                    4</span>


informant who was present in the ground floor was showing

silver coins to them. At that point of time, three more persons

came and they showed revolvers to the staffs and security

guards and took them to the first floor and locked them in the

V.I.P. office room, took away mobile phones from all of them,

assaulted them and threatened them with dire consequence by

showing revolvers and asked them not to shout or come out of

the room. Thereafter, the culprits demanded the keys of the

strong room from the informant and when the informant told

them that he was not possessing the keys, he was assaulted by

the culprits and then they asked the elder brother of the

informant namely, Ashok Kumar Agarwalla (P.W.37) about the

keys of the strong room by showing revolver and assaulted him

for which he handed over the keys of the strong room. The

strong room was opened by the culprits and they took away all

the   gold,   silver,   diamond   ornaments,   cash   and   also   the

ornaments which were kept by different customers and while

decamping from the spot, they took away the licensed revolver

of the brother of the informant namely, Naresh Agrawalla

(P.W.2) and fitted three bombs in front of the V.I.P. office room

gate and threatened that whosoever would try to open the V.I.P.

office gate, there would be blasting of bombs. After sometime,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                 5</span>


the brother of the informant namely Naresh Agrawalla (P.W.2)

came to the up-stairs and rescued the informant and others. It is

stated in the first information report that the cost of the

Jewellery taken by the culprits would be around rupees 2 crores

and 50 lakhs and the cash taken would be Rs.5,50,000/-.

</p><p id="p_7">3.         Basing on such first information report presented by

P.W.2 Ramesh Kumar Agrawalla, Dhanupali P.S. Case No.16 of

2008 was registered on 03.02.2008 under <a href="/doc/1119707/" id="a_8">section 395</a> of the

Indian Penal Code and <a href="/doc/73862/" id="a_9">sections 25</a> and <a href="/doc/244673/" id="a_10">27</a> of the Arms Act and

the officer in charge of the police station namely, Chandra Majhi

(P.W.39) took up investigation of the case. During course of

investigation, he examined the complainant, sent VHF message

to the other police stations, visited the spot and prepared the

spot map (Ext.22) and seized the gold and diamond ornaments

from M/s. Jewellery World and prepared seizure list to that effect

and left the same in zima of Binod Kumar Agrawalla (P.W.31)

vide zimanama (Ext.23). As per the order of the Superintendent

of Police, Sambalpur, he handed over the charge of investigation

to Sri Niranjan Mishra (P.W.42), Circle Inspector of Police,

Ainthapalli, Sambalpur on the very day i.e. 03.02.2008. After

taking over charge of investigation, P.W.42 examined the

witnesses, seized some articles from the V.I.P. office room of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                  6</span>


M/s. Jewellery World in presence of the witnesses. He made

seizure of three handmade bombs near the V.I.P. room of the

first floor in presence of the witnesses vide Ext.8. The scientific

officials visited the spot and prepared their report vide Ext.28.

P.W.42 seized the gun licence which was standing in the name of

Naresh Kumar Agrawalla (P.W.1) and left the same in the zima

of P.W.1 vide zimanama Ext.1. He made seizure of certain other

incriminating articles from the spot and then on 07.06.2008 he

handed over the charge of investigation to Gobardhan Sahoo

(P.W.44), Circle Inspector, Sadar, Sambalpur. P.W.44 prayed for

conducting test identification parade in respect of the seized

property. A team of officers went to Jharkhand for detecting the

culprits as well as for recovery of stolen articles. P.W.44

proceeded to Ranchi, engaged spies and arrested one accused

and seized melted stolen ornaments from a jewellery shop. The

appellants Sujit Kumar Sao @ Gupta, Rajendra Singh and

Subash Kumar Barman were arrested on 11.06.2008 from

Ranchi. On search of the rexin bag seized from the appellant

Sujit Kumar Sao, jewellery of M/s. Jewellery World, Sambalpur

were found which were seized under seizure list Ext.25. From the

possession of appellant Rajendra Singh, a rexin bag containing

stolen gold ornaments were seized under seizure list Ext.20.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                  7</span>


Similarly from the possession of appellant Subash Kumar

Barman one rexin bag containing jewellery was seized under

seizure list Ext.26. The three appellants were produced before

the learned C.J.M., Ranchi and a prayer was made for transit

remand for their production in the Court of learned S.D.J.M.,

Sambalpur and on 13.06.2008 all the three appellants were

produced in the Court of learned S.D.J.M., Sambalpur. On the

prayer of the P.W.44, test identification parade was conducted

on 19.06.2008 in respect of appellants Raj @ Rajendra Singh,

Sujit Kumar Sao @ Gupta and Subash Kumar Barman which was

conducted by Raj Kumar Das (P.W.29), J.M.F.C., Sambalpur. In

the Test Identification parade, P.W.2 Ramesh Kumar Agrawalla,

P.W.3 Ajay Kumar Agrawalla and P.W.37 Ashok Agrawalla so

also one Gitanjali Dani participated as identifying witnesses and

the identifying witnesses identified all the three appellants

correctly. Accordingly, P.W.29 prepared the test identification

parade report vide Ext.5/2. Similarly test identification parade in

respect of the seized properties were held in the chamber of

P.W.29 and P.W.2 Ramesh Kumar Agrawalla correctly identified

the ornaments and accordingly, test identification parade report

vide Ext.6/1 was prepared. P.W.44 submitted first charge sheet

and handed over the charge of investigation to Saroj Kumar
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                    8</span>


Mohapatra (P.W.45), I.I.C. of Dhanupalli Police Station who on

completion of investigation submitted final charge sheet on

10.07.2008 against six accused persons including the three

appellants under <a href="/doc/1119707/" id="a_11">section 395</a> of the Indian Penal Code and

<a href="/doc/73862/" id="a_12">sections 25</a> and <a href="/doc/244673/" id="a_13">27</a> of the Arms Act.
</p>
<p id="p_8">4.           The defence plea of the appellants was one of denial

and it is pleaded that a false case has been foisted.

</p><p id="p_9">5.           In order to prove its case, the prosecution examined

forty five witnesses and exhibited thirty one documents.

</p><p id="p_10">             The relevant witnesses so far as identification is

concerned are P.W.2 Ramesh Kumar Agrawalla, P.W.3 Ajay

Kumar Agarwalla, P.W.12 Gayatri Mishra and P.W.37 Ashok

Kumar Agarwalla and the Magistrate who conducted the test

identification   parade   is   P.W.29   Raj   Kumar   Das,   J.M.F.C.,

Sambalpur.
</p>
<p id="p_11">6.           P.W.2 who is the informant in the case has stated

about the commission of dacoity in the jewellery shop on

03.02.2008 and he also participated in the test identification

parade in respect of the appellants and the seized stolen

properties and he correctly identified all the appellants in the T.I.

parade which was conducted by P.W.29. He also identified the

ornaments in the test identification parade which was conducted
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                    9</span>


by P.W.29 in his Court chamber. P.W.2 has been cross examined

at length but nothing substantial has been elicited in the cross-

examination so      as to disbelieve     his evidence relating to

identification of the appellants as well as the stolen properties.

</p><p id="p_12">            Learned     counsels   for   the   appellants   have   not

disputed about the occurrence but they only challenged the

identity of the culprits.
</p>
<p id="p_13">            So far as P.W.3 Ajay Kumar Agarwalla is concerned,

he has stated that he had got a hardware shop near the

jewellery shop of the informant and he saw the accused persons

who committed the crime and he stated that in the test

identification parade, he identified the appellants Rajendra Singh

and Subash Kumar Barman though the Magistrate (P.W.29)

stated that P.W.3 identified all the appellants correctly. P.W.3

has also been cross examined at length but nothing has been

elicited so as to disbelieve his testimony.
</p>
<p id="p_14">            P.W.12 Gayatri Mishra was working as Sales man in

the M/s. Jewellery World and she stated about the participation

of the appellants in the crime. She stated in the chief

examination that she knew the appellants and named them. This

witness has not participated in the T.I. Parade. In the cross-

examination, she stated that she had no prior acquaintance with
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                     10</span>


the accused persons and she saw them for the first time after

the occurrence. In view of the evidence elicited in the cross-

examination, the evidence in the chief examination that she

knew the appellants by name cannot be accepted. Since the

names of the accused persons have not been mentioned in the

first information report and P.W.12 has not participated in the

test identification parade, therefore, her evidence relating to

participation of the appellants in the crime for the first time in

Court cannot be accepted. The evidence of identification parade

is not substantive evidence but it is to test the statement of the

witness   made   in   the   Court   which   constitutes   substantive

evidence and to strengthen the trustworthiness of the evidence

of the witness. Identification of the accused at the trial for the

first time is from its very nature inherently of a weak character.

Hence, the evidence of P.W.12 is of no consequence.

</p><p id="p_15">           The evidence of P.W.37 Ashok Kumar Agarwalla who

is the elder brother of P.W.2 is also very clear relating to the

occurrence. He participated in the test identification parade and

identified all the three appellants but in Court he identified two

appellants i.e., Rajendra Singh and Subash Kumar Barman.

P.W.37 himself has not stated that he identified the appellant

Sujit Kumar Sao @ Gupta in the test identification parade. He
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                   11</span>


has been cross examined at length but nothing has been elicited

so as to disbelieve his testimony.
</p>
<p id="p_16">            On meticulous analysis of evidence of P.Ws.2, 3 and

37, the three identifying witnesses, it is clear that P.W.2

identified all the three appellants in the test identification parade

as well as in Court, whereas P.W.3 and P.W.37 though identified

all the appellants in the test identification parade but they

identified only two appellants in Court i.e., appellants Rajendra

Singh and Subash Kumar Barman.
</p>
<p id="p_17">            The evidence of these three identifying witnesses

coupled with the evidence of the learned Magistrate who

conducted the test identification parade and the fact that no

infirmity has been pointed out in holding the test identification

parade; I am of the view that the complicity of the appellants

has been fully established by the prosecution. Additionally, the

evidence of P.W.44 indicates that stolen ornaments of M/s.

Jewellery World were recovered from the possession of the three

appellants which were seized under seizure lists Exts.20, 25 and

26 and the ornaments were placed in the test identification

parade which was conducted by P.W.29 and the same were also

correctly identified by P.W.2. No infirmity has been pointed out
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                                     12</span>


by the learned counsel for the appellants in relation to the

identification of the properties.
</p>
<p id="p_18">            Therefore,   not   only      the   appellants   have   been

identified in the test identification parade but also stolen

ornaments which were seized from their possession were also

identified in the test identification parade and therefore, I am of

the humble view that the learned Trial Court is justified in

convicting the appellants under <a href="/doc/1119707/" id="a_14">section 395</a> of the Indian Penal

Code.
</p>
<p id="p_19">            The learned Trial Court has imposed the sentence of

rigorous imprisonment for ten years to each of the appellants

and further directed each of them to pay a fine of Rs.20,000/-

(rupees twenty thousand), in default to undergo R.I. for six

months. The appellants are in custody as per the charge sheet

since 12.06.2008 on which date they were produced in Court.

Learned counsels for the appellants submit that the appellants

have already undergone substantive sentence for more than nine

years and therefore, the substantive sentence be reduced to the

period already undergone. Considering the submissions made by

the learned counsels for the appellants and taking into account
