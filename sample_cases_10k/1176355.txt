<p id="p_1">            This judgment shall dispose of Crl. Appeal No.

1164-SB of 2000 filed by Satish and another and Criminal

Appeal No. 1185-SB of 2000, filed by Raju alias Rajbeer,

arising out of the judgment of conviction dated 16.10.2000,

and the order of sentence dated 20.10.2000, rendered by the

Court of Additional Sessions Judge, Sonepat, vide which it

convicted all the accused, for the offence punishable under

<a href="/doc/1557102/" id="a_1">Section 20(b)</a> of the Narcotic Drugs &amp; <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_2">Psychotropic

Substances Act</a>, 1985 (hereinafter called as 'the Act' only) and

sentenced them to undergo rigorous imprisonment, for a period

of ten years each, and to pay a fine of Rs.1 lac each, and in

default of payment of the same, to undergo further rigorous

imprisonment for a period of two years each, for having been

found in possession of 500 grams, 500 grams and 1 KG.,

charas respectively, at the relevant time, falling within the

ambit of commercial quantity, without any permit or licence.

</p><p id="p_2">2.                The facts, in brief, are that on 29.08.1999,

Amar Dass, Sub Inspector/Station House Officer along with

other police officials, was present at Sonepat T-point Gohana.

Baljeet Singh, independent witness met them. He was having

talk with him, when a secret information was received that a

motorcycle bearing No. HR-11-9597 being ridden by Raju,

Dharambir and Satish, who were indulging in the business of

charas, was coming and they were bringing charas. He was also

informed that in case a picket was held, they could be

apprehended.    A picket was held at T-point, Sonepat road,

Gohana. A motorcycle came from the side of Panipat, at a very

fast speed. The motorcycle did not stop, despite the signal

having been given to it. The riders thereof tried to run away

towards Sonepat. However, all the three persons i.e. rider and

the pillion riders of the motorcycle, were apprehended by the

police.   The motorcycle was being ridden by Raju, while

Satish and Dharambir were the pillion riders. Sub Inspector

Amar Dass asked them, that he suspected that         they were

carrying contraband. He further told them that they could be

searched, in the presence of a Magistrate or a Gazetted Officer.

 Written notice, in this regard, was also given to Satish and

Dharambir. However, Raju alias Rajbeer, accused , managed

to run away, from the spot, after leaving his polythene packet

on the motorcycle. The Deputy Superintendent of Police was

summoned through wireless message.        Ashok Kumar, DSP,

reached the spot, on whose directions, the search was

conducted.     500 Grams charas was recovered from the

possession of Satish, accused, which was kept by him, in the
                Crl. Appeal No.1164-SB of 2000

right side pocket of his pant, in polythene packet. 10 grams

charas was separated as a sample. 500 Grams charas, was

recovered from the possession of accused Dharambir, which he

had kept in the right side pocket of his shirt. 10 grams charas

was separated as a sample. One Kilogram charas kept on the

handle of motorcycle, in a bag, left by Raju, accused, who

managed to escape, was also recovered. 10 grams charas, was

taken out as a sample.        The samples so drawn, and the

remaining charas, were converted into separate parcels, duly

sealed, and taken into possession,    along with motorcycle,

vide a separate recovery memo. Ruqa was sent to the Police

station, on the basis whereof, the FIR was recorded.   The site

plan was prepared. Satish and Dharambir, accused were

arrested. Raju, accused, was arrested later on. The statements

of the witnesses were recorded. After the completion of

investigation, the accused were challaned.

</p><p id="p_3">3.                 On their appearance, in the Court,       the

accused were supplied the copies of documents, relied upon by

the prosecution. Charge under <a href="/doc/1557102/" id="a_3">Section 20(b)</a> of the Act, was

framed against the accused, to which they pleaded not guilty

and claimed judicial trial.

</p><p id="p_5">4.                   The prosecution, in support of its case,

examined Pawan Kumar,C, (PW-1), who handed over             the

special report to the Illaqa Magistrate, Subhash Chander, ASI,

( PW-2 ), a formal witness, who recorded FIR Ex.P-3, on the

basis of ruqa Ex.P-2, Ramesh Chander, HC ( PW-3 ), a formal

witness, who tendered his affidavit Ex.PA, Krishan Chander,

Constable,   ( PW-4 ), a formal witness, who tendered his

affidavit Ex.PB, Ram Avtar, ASI, ( PW-5 ), a witness to the

recovery, Baljit Singh, ( PW-6 ), an independent witness, who

did not support the case of the prosecution, Amar Dass, S.I.

( PW-7 ), Investigating Officer, who investigated the case and

prepared various documents, Chand Singh ( PW-8 ), who stated

that Raju, accused is the brother-in-law of his brother Baljit ,

who is the owner of Motorcycle No. HR-11-7587 and Ashok

Kumar, DSP, ( PW-9 ), a witness to the recovery. Thereafter,

the   Additional Public Prosecutor for the State,    closed its

evidence.

<p id="p_6">5.                  The statements of the accused, under

<a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_4">Section 313</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure, were recorded.

They were put all the incriminating circumstances, appearing

against them, in the prosecution evidence, and pleaded false

implication. They, however, did not produce any evidence in

their defence.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                             6</span>



</p><p id="p_8">6.                 After hearing the Public Prosecutor for the

State, the Counsel for the accused, and, on going through the

evidence, on record, the trial Court, convicted and sentenced

the accused, as stated hereinbefore.
</p>
<p id="p_9">7.                 Feeling aggrieved, against the judgment of

conviction, and the order of sentence, rendered by the trial

Court, the instant appeals, were filed by the appellants.

</p><p id="p_10">8.                 I have heard the Counsel for the parties, and

have gone through the evidence and record of the case,

carefully.
</p>
<p id="p_11">9.                 The Counsel         for Raju     @ Rajbeer,

appellant, at the very outset submitted that Raju alias Rajbeer,

accused, allegedly escaped from the spot and one kilogram

charas was recovered from the bag, lying on the handle of the

motorcycle.     He further submitted that           under these

circumstances, it could not be said that Raju alias Rajbeer,

accused was in conscious possession of the contraband.      The

submission of the Counsel for Raju alias Rajbeer, appellant, in

this regard, does not appear to be correct. Raju alias Rajbeer

was the rider of the motorcycle, whereas Satish and Dharambir

were the pillion riders. No doubt, in the first instance, all of

them were apprehended, yet in the meanwhile, Raju, rider of

the motorcycle, managed to escape by leaving the polythene

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                             7</span>



packet, containing charas, on the handle of the same. Under

these circumstances, it could be very well said that he was in

possession of the charas, which he left on the handle of the

motorcycle, while making good his escape. The mere fact that

he managed to escape from the spot, in itself, clearly revealed

his guilty conduct. In case, he was not in possession of the

contraband, then why he ran away from the spot, after leaving

the bag, containing charas, on the handle of the motorcycle,

which he was riding. It was for him to explain the aforesaid

circumstances. He , however, failed to explain the same. As

such, the accused was found in possession of, and in control

over the bag, containing charas.   Once the possession of the

accused, and his control over the contraband, was proved, then

statutory presumption under <a href="/doc/1297682/" id="a_5">Sections 54</a> and <a href="/doc/852142/" id="a_6">35</a> of the Act,

operated against him, that he was in conscious possession

thereof.   Thereafter, it was for him, to rebut the statutory

presumption, by leading cogent and convincing evidence.

However, the appellant, failed to rebut that presumption, either

during the course of cross-examination of the prosecution

witnesses, or by leading defence evidence.            In these

circumstances, the trial Court was right, in holding that he was

in conscious possession of the contraband. <a href="/doc/1297682/" id="a_7">Section 54</a> of the

Act ibid reads as under :-

"Presumption of culpable mental state:-            (1)   In any

prosecution for an offence under this Act, which requires a

culpable mental state of the accused, the Court shall presume

the existence of such mental state but it shall be a defence for

the accused to prove the fact that he had no such mental state

with respect to the act charged as an offence in that

prosecution.

intention, motive knowledge of a fact and belief in, or reason

abundantly clear, that once an accused, is found to be in

possession of a contraband, he is presumed to have committed

the offence, under the relevant provisions of the Act, until the

contrary is proved. According to <a href="/doc/852142/" id="a_11">Section 35</a> of the Act ibid,

of this position because of the presumption available in law.

<p id="p_20">9-C.               The facts of Madan Lal's case (supra) in

brief, were that accused Manjit Singh was driving the Car and

the remaining four accused, were sitting therein. One steel

container (dolu) in a black coloured bag, was recovered from

the said Car, which contained 820 gms. charas. All the accused

were convicted and sentenced by the trial Court, holding that

they were found in conscious possession of charas, despite the

fact, that one of the accused, admitted his conscious

possession, of the contraband. The Apex Court held that the

trial Court, was right, in coming to the conclusion, that the

accused were found in conscious possession of charas, as they

had failed to explain, as to how they were travelling in a Car

together, which was not a public vehicle. The Apex Court

upheld the conviction, and sentence, awarded to the accused.

In the instant case, Raju alias Rajbeer, accused failed to

explain, as to how, the bag     containing one kilogram charas

was kept on the handle of the motorcycle, which was being

ridden by him. The facts of Madan Lal's case (supra) are

similar and identical to the facts of the present case.      The

principle of law, laid down, in Madan Lal's case (supra) is

fully applicable to the facts of the present case. In the instant

case, in his statement, under <a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_14">Section 313</a> Cr.P.C., the accused

took up the plea, only of false implication. He did not take up

the plea, that he was directed by the owner, to take the bag, to

a certain place, and obeying his command, he was taking the

same, to that destination. As stated above, the accused, thus,

miserably failed to rebut the statutory presumption, referred to

above.   Thus,     his conscious possession, in respect of the

contraband, was proved, and, as such, the submission of the

Counsel for Raju, appellant, being without merit, must fail,

and the same stands rejected.

<p id="p_22">10.                 The Counsel for Raju, appellant,however,

placed reliance <a href="/doc/45198249/" id="a_15">Avtar Singh v. State of Punjab</a> 2002 (4)RCR

( Criminal ), 180 ( S.C. ), to contend that Raju, accused was

travelling in a truck , where-from the          contraband was

recovered. The Apex Court held that they could not be said to

be in conscious possession of the contraband. However, at the

same time, it was held by the Apex Court, that, at the most,

they could be said to be abettors.      Abetment is an offence

under <a href="/doc/1252855/" id="a_16">Section 29</a> of the Act.         They were, however, not

convicted by the Apex Court, for the offence under <a href="/doc/1252855/" id="a_17">Section 29</a>

of the Act, on the ground, that no charge for abetment had

been framed against them.        Under these circumstances, in

Avtar Singh's case ( supra ) , it was never held by the Apex

Court that the appellants did not commit any offence, under the

Act. Even in Megh Singh Vs. State of Punjab, 2003(4) RCR (

Crl. ) 319(SC), Avtar Singh and others's case ( supra ) was

noticed and distinguished on factual matrix.       The facts of

Avtar Singh's case ( supra ) are distinguishable from the

facts of the instant case.   In view of the principle of law laid

down, in Madan Lal's case ( supra ) , the facts whereof, are

similar and identical to the facts of the instant case, the trial

Court, was right, in holding that the appellants were in

conscious possession of charas, recovered from them. No

help, therefore, can be drawn by the Counsel for Raju alias

Rajbeer, from Avtar Singh's case ( supra ). In this view of the

matter, the submission of the Counsel for Raju, appellant, being

without merit, must fail, and the same stands rejected.

</p><p id="p_24">11.                It was next submitted by the Counsel for

Raju, appellant, that the motorcycle did not belong to Raju,

appellant. He further submitted that Chand Singh, PW8, stated

that he was the owner of the motorcycle in question. He further

submitted that under these circumstances, Raju, accused, did

not commit any offence punishable under <a href="/doc/1557102/" id="a_18">Section 20(b)</a> of the

Act. The submission of the Counsel for Raju, appellant, in this

regard, does not appear to be correct.     Chand Singh son of

Hawa Singh, PW8, stated, on oath, that Raju son of Ram

Kishan, accused, is the brother-in-law of his brother Baljeet. He

further stated that he was the owner of motorcycle No. HR11-

7587. He further stated that about one year before 17.08.2000,

Raju, appellant, had come to him, and asked him to give his

motorcycle. He further stated that, at that time, he was

accompanied by two other accused, who were correctly

identified by him ( Chand Singh ), in the Court. He further

stated that Raju alongwith his co-accused took his motorcycle.

The suggestion put to him, during the course of cross-

examination that Raju never took the motorcycle from him, was

denied by him. From the statement of Chand Singh, PW8, it

was, thus, proved beyond doubt that Raju, accused, took the

motorcycle, from him, ( Chand Singh ). Since Raju, accused,is

nearly related to Chand Singh, being the brother-in-law of his

brother, it could not be possible for him ( Chand Singh ) to

refuse to hand over the motorcycle, to him, on his request. It

was, under these circumstances, that Raju, accused, alongwith

his co-accused, was found in possession of the motorcycle in

question. Even the other co-accused of Raju, accused, came

along with him, to the house of Chand Singh, PW8, whose

motorcycle was taken by them. Thereafter, Raju, accused and

his co-accused namely Satish and Dharambir used his

motorcycle, for the purpose of transporting charas, referred to

above.    In these circumstances, the mere fact that Raju,

accused, was not the owner of the motorcycle, did not mean

that he was having no connection with the same. Since he was

in possession of the motorcycle, it was for him, to explain, as to

how he along with his two co-accused was found carrying

contraband on the same.     There was no reason on the part of

Chand Singh, PW8, to depose falsely against his relation Raju,

accused, brother-in-law of his brother Baljeet.    Chand Singh,

PW-8 made a truthful statement, which by, no stretch of

imagination, could be said to be tainted. In this view of the

matter, the custody of Raju, accused, of the motorcycle, may be

temporary, at the relevant time, but he along with his two co-

accused was found transporting contraband on the same,. It ,

therefore, could be said to be sufficient to fasten the liability

of the Counsel for Raju, appellant, being without merit, must

fail, and the same stands rejected.

<p id="p_25">12.                It was next submitted by the Counsel for the

appellants that Baljeet Singh, independent witness, though

joined and examined, as PW-6, yet he did support the case of

the prosecution. They      further submitted that, under these

circumstances, it could be said that no recovery, whatsoever,

from the accused was effected but they were falsely implicated

in the instant case. No doubt, Baljeet Singh, PW-6, stated in his

statement that nothing was recovered from the accused, in his

presence.     He further stated, during the course of cross-

examination that    Ex.PC, PE, PG, PH and PJ, the documents,

which were prepared, at the spot, bore his signatures. He,

however, further stated that his signatures were obtained on

blank papers. The statement of Baljeet Singh, independent

witness, cannot be said to be truthful by any stretch of

imagination. The recovery, in this case, was effected on

29.08.1999.    This witness was examined, in the Court, on

25.05.2000. It means that he was examined, in the Court, as a

witness, after about nine months of the recovery. In case, no

recovery had been effected, from the accused, in his presence

or his signatures had been obtained on blank papers, he had

many occasions to make a complaint, against the Investigating

Officer, to the higher authorities. He, however, did not do so.

He kept mum for about nine months and, ultimately, came to

the Court, to depose that no recovery was effected, in his

presence, just with a view to help the accused. It may be stated

here, that the case of the prosecution cannot be allowed to

hinge on the statement of a single witness. The Court         is

required to scrutinize the evidence of the prosecution, as a

whole, and come to the conclusion, as to whether, the same is

cogent, reliable, and trust worthy or not. Once the Court comes

to the conclusion, after scrutiny of the evidence of the

prosecution, as a whole that the same is reliable and carries a

ring of truth, then the mere fact that one of the witnesses

though he may be an independent witness, did not support its

case, does not cause any dent. The other evidence has been

thoroughly scrutinized, and it has been found, to be cogent,

convincing, credible and trust-worthy.    The trial Court was

right in relying upon the same.     <a href="/doc/914982/" id="a_19">In State of Rajasthan v.

Udai Lal</a>     2008 (2) RCR 956 ( SC ), four independent

witnesses were joined, and examined by the prosecution. They

all resiled, from their previous statements.    However, they

admitted their signatures, on the documents.          In these

circumstances , the Apex Court held that their evidence should

be ignored as     they were untruthfulness witnesses,        and

reliance, on the evidence of other witnesses, could be placed,

to bring home the guilt to the accused. Ultimately, the accused

was convicted on the basis of the other evidence, produced by

the prosecution. In the instant case, the other evidence led by

the prosecution has been held to be cogent and convincing and

the trial Court was right in placing reliance upon the same. <a href="/doc/263706/" id="a_20">In

P.P. Fathima v. State of Kerala</a> 2004(1) RCR (Criminal) 81

(SC), the Panch witnesses did not support the case of the

prosecution. It was held that their evidence, by itself, would

not be fatal to the case of the prosecution. The principle of

law, laid down, in the aforesaid authorities, is fully applicable

to the facts of the instant case. The prosecution, acted in an

impartial and bonafide manner, in examining Baljeet Singh,

independent witness.    Had he been not examined, then the

allegation against the prosecution, would have been that

independent witness had not been examined by it, and, as such

the material witness had been withheld by it. On account of

non-corroboration of    the evidence of     other witnesses, by

Baljit Singh, no dent was caused in the prosecution story, in

any manner.         The submission of the Counsel for the

appellants, being without merit, must fail, and the same stands

</p><p id="p_27">13.               The Counsel for the appellants, however,

placed reliance on <a href="/doc/1823693/" id="a_21">Jagdish v. State of Madhya Pradesh</a>,

2002 AIR SCW 2765 , to contend that if the evidence of the

official witnesses is not supported by the panches witnesses,

then conviction could not be recorded on the basis thereof..

The submission of the Counsel for the appellants, in this

regard, does not appear to be correct. Jagdish's case ( supra )

was decided, on the peculiar facts and circumstances,

prevailing therein.    In that case,     the recovery of the

contraband, was effected from one of the passengers, travelling

in a bus. The Apex Court, in the facts and circumstances,

prevailing in that case, came to the conclusion, that the

Narcotic Sub Inspector, who had simply gone to check the

buses, without any prior information, could not know, as to

how only one of the many passengers, travelling in the bus,

was in possession of contraband. The Apex Court also came to

the conclusion, that the story put forth by the prosecution, was

unnatural and improbable. The Apex Court further held that

the driver and the conductor of the bus, who could be said to be

the natural witnesses, to the alleged recovery, did not support

the case of the prosecution, and, as such, the evidence of the

official witnesses could not be believed. Even the testimony of

Dudhnath Ram, Narcotic Sub Inspector, PW-1 , examined in
                Crl. Appeal No.1164-SB of 2000
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">                             19</span>



that case, was found to be suffering from many infirmities.

Taking into consideration, the overall facts and circumstances

prevailing in that case, the Apex Court, came to the conclusion,

that the accused was required to be given the benefit of doubt.

In the instant case, the prosecution story is neither un-natural

nor improbable, in any manner. It is quite natural and probable.

The recovery in this case, was effected, in the presence of a

Gazetted Officer, i.e. Ashok Kumar, DSP. The evidence of the

prosecution witnesses, as stated above, on scrutiny, has been

found to be cogent, convincing, reliable and trust-worthy.

Nothing could be brought out during the course of their cross-

examination, to discredit    the same. The evidence of other

prosecution witnesses, in this case, does not suffer from

inherent lacunae and infirmities. The facts of the instant case,

being    distinguishable from the facts of Jagdish's case

( supra ), no help can be drawn by the Counsel for the

appellant, therefrom. In this view of the matter, the submission

of the Counsel for the appellants, being without merit, must

fail, and the same stands rejected.

<p id="p_28">14.                It was next submitted by the Counsel for the

appellants, that the seal, after use, was handed over to Baljit

Singh, independent witness, who did not support the case of the

circumstances, a serious dent was caused, in the prosecution

story. It has been held above that non-supporting the case of

the prosecution by Baljit Singh, independent witness, did not

cause any dent. Even if, the seal had not been handed over to

the independent witness that would not have            made any

difference.   As there is no requirement of law, that the

Investigating Officer, should hand over the seal, after use, to an

independent witness, or to any other member of the raiding

party, the mere fact that the seal was handed over to Baljeet

Singh, after use, who did not support the case            of the

prosecution, did not, in any way, cast any doubt on the case. In

this view of the matter, the submission of the Counsel for the

as a result whereof, there was complete violation of the

mandatory provisions of <a href="/doc/1841395/" id="a_22">Section 42</a> of the Act. They further

        <a href="/doc/1841395/" id="a_36">Section 42</a> of the Act operate in different spheres. Since the

        conveyance has been specifically included in <a href="/doc/1374738/" id="a_37">Section 43</a> of the

        Act also, therefore, the conveyance which is found in a public

        place or in transit would be covered under the provisions of

        <a href="/doc/1374738/" id="a_38">Section 43</a> of the Act whereas conveyance used in <a href="/doc/1841395/" id="a_39">Section 42</a> of

        the Act has to be read as conveyance which is other than a

        public place.    This interpretation is the only harmonious

        interpretation of <a href="/doc/1841395/" id="a_40">Sections 42</a> and <a href="/doc/1374738/" id="a_41">43</a> of the Act."

</blockquote><p id="p_35">15.D.         It is well settled principle of law that the

provisions of a Statute are to be construed, in harmonious

manner so that none of the same is rendered nugatory. By

harmonious construing the provisions <a href="/doc/1841395/" id="a_42">Sections 42</a> and <a href="/doc/1374738/" id="a_43">43</a> of

the Act, it can be safely concluded that if a conveyance is

intercepted or apprehended at a public place, or in transit, then

the provisions of <a href="/doc/1841395/" id="a_44">Section 42</a> of the Act would not be

applicable.

"7. <a href="/doc/1374738/" id="a_45">Section 43</a> of the NDPS Act provides that any officer of any

of the departments mentioned in <a href="/doc/1841395/" id="a_46">Section 42</a> may seize in any

public place or in transit any narcotic drug or psychotropic

substance etc. in respect of which he has reason to believe that

an offence punishable under the Act has been committed. He is

also authorized to detain and search any person whom he has

reason to believe to have committed an offence punishable

under the Act. Explanation to <a href="/doc/1374738/" id="a_47">Section 43</a> lays down that for

the purposes of this section, the expression "public place"

includes any public conveyance, hotel, shop, or other place

intended for use by, or accessible to the public.

</p><p id="p_38">8. <a href="/doc/1841395/" id="a_48">Sections 42</a> and <a href="/doc/1374738/" id="a_49">43</a>, therefore, contemplate two difference

situations. <a href="/doc/1841395/" id="a_50">Section 42</a> contemplates entry into and search of

any building, conveyance or enclosed place, while <a href="/doc/1374738/" id="a_51">Section 43</a>

contemplates a seizure made in any public place or in transit.

If seizure is made under <a href="/doc/1841395/" id="a_52">Section 42</a> between sunset and

sunrise, the requirement of the proviso thereto has to be

complied with. There is no such proviso in <a href="/doc/1374738/" id="a_53">Section 43</a> of the

Act and, therefore, it is obvious that if a public conveyance is

searched in a public place, the officer making the search is not

required to record his satisfaction as contemplated by the

proviso to <a href="/doc/1841395/" id="a_54">Section 42</a> of the NDPS Act for searching the

vehicle between sunset and the sunrise."

15-F.        In the instant case, Amar Dass, SI/SHO, had

received an information, that the accused-referred to above, had

been coming on a vehicle, with a big haul of charas, for the

purpose of smuggling and selling the same to the people. It

was, in this view of the matter, that a picket was held by the

Inspector alongwith other police officials.    Such information

was general, in nature, and not specific. The recovery was

effected from the motorcycle, in question, in transit, at a public

place. The submission of the Counsel for the appellants, being

devoid of merit, must fail, and is rejected.

</p><p id="p_40">16.                It was next submitted by the Counsel for the

appellants, that though the alleged recovery was effected, in

this case, on 29.08.1999, yet the samples were sent to the office

of the Forensic Science Laboratory on 26.09.1999 and received

in the Laboratory on 05.10.1999. They further submitted that,

thus, there was delay of one month and seven days, which

remained unexplained, and ,as such, the possibility of

tampering with the same, could not be ruled out. The

submission of the Counsel for the appellants, in this regard,

does not appear to be correct. It is, no doubt, true that there is

no explanation, with regard to delay. However, mere delay, in

itself, is not sufficient to come to the conclusion, that the

sample parcels were tampered with, until the same reached the

office of the Forensic Science Laboratory. The other evidence,

produced by the prosecution, has been held to be cogent,

convincing, reliable and trustworthy. From the other evidence,

it was proved that none tampered with the samples, until the

same reached the office of the Forensic Science Laboratory.

Even, there is report of the Laboratory Ex.P1, which clearly

proves that the seals on the exhibits were intact, on arrival, till

the time of their analysis and agreed with the specimen

impression of the seals. The report Ex.P1        of the Forensic

Science Laboratory is per-se admissible, in toto, under <a href="/doc/692331/" id="a_55">Section

293</a> of the Code of criminal Procedure.      There is no challenge

to the report of the Forensic Science Laboratory, in this case.

In State of Orissa Vs. Kanduri Sahoo 2004(1) RCR

(Criminal) 196 (S.C.), it was held that mere delay in sending

the samples to the Laboratory, is not fatal, where there is

evidence that the seized articles remained in safe custody.

Since, it was proved that none tampered with the samples, until

the same were received, in the office of the Forensic Science

Laboratory, the submission of the Counsel for the appellants,

merely based on       conjectures, does not hold good. The

principle of law, laid down, in the aforesaid authority, is fully

applicable to the facts of the instant case. Since it was proved

that none tampered with the samples, until the same reached the

the Counsel for the appellants, in this regard, being without

merit, must fail, and the same stands rejected.

</p><p id="p_41">17.         It was next submitted by the Counsel for the

appellants that there was over writing in the number of the

motorcycle in memo Ex.PJ and no explanation with regard to

the same, was furnished. It may be stated here that if on

account of inadvertence, wrong number of the motorcycle,

was originally written in memo Ex.PJ and when the

Investigating Officer, at the same time, came to know about

the correct number thereof, and he corrected the same, that did

not mean that such an over-writing was made by him, either to

cause any prejudice to the accused or to give benefit to the

prosecution. It generally happens that when a person writes a

matter, some mistake are committed therein, or sometimes,

wrong dates are written. If, in the same process, the wrong

dates or other incorrect matter are corrected that does not

mean that any dent is caused in the prosecution story. No

help, therefore, can be drawn by the Counsel for the

appellants, from this fact. In this view of the matter, the

submission of the Counsel for the appellants, being without,

must fail, and the same stands rejected.

</p><p id="p_43">18.               It was next submitted by the Counsel for

the appellants, that though the alleged recovery, in this case,

was effected on 29.08.1999, yet Ashok Kumar, DSP, when

appeared in the Court, stated that the recovery was effected on

29.07.1999. It appears that while deposing in the Court as

PW-9, either Ashok Kumar, DSP forgot the correct date or

due to slip of tongue gave the date as 29.07.1999, or on

account of typographical mistake, the same was typed as

29.07.1999.    Such inadvertent mistakes do occur while

recording the evidence. In these circumstances, with a view to

come to the correct conclusion, the Court, is required to take

into consideration, the entire evidence, produced by the

prosecution. If after due assessment of the entire evidence,

produced by the prosecution, the Court comes to the

conclusion, that the correct date of recovery, was the one,

which was stated by the other witnesses, then, such a clerical

or inadvertent mistake, can be ignored.      Such a mistake,

which occurred on account of the slip of tongue or while

typing the deposition of Ashok Kumar, DSP, PW-9, could

certainly be ignored. The trial Court was right in ignoring the

same and coming to the conclusion, that the case against the

accused, stood proved, beyond a reasonable doubt. In this

view of the matter, the submission of the Counsel for the

appreciation of evidence, and law, on the point. The same do

not warrant any interference. The same are liable to be upheld.

</p><p id="p_46">21.                   For the reasons recorded, hereinbefore, both

the appeals are dismissed. The judgment of conviction dated

16.10.2000 and the order of sentence, dated 20.10.2000, are

upheld. If the appellants are on bail, their bail bonds shall
