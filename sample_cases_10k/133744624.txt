discipline   was   not   maintained   by   the   defendant   in   this   case   and   despite 
requests  the  bill   amount  was  not  paid.  A  legal  notice  dated  24.03.2012 was 
served upon the defendant.   However, no reply was filed. Therefore, present 
suit Under Order XXXVII, CPC was filed and no relief that does not fall within 
ambit of this rule has been claimed.

09.10.2013, wherein again no appearance was filed on behalf of the defendant. 
Service was complete, however no appearance was filed.   As appearance has 
not been filed within the stipulated period. Therefore, the suit of the plaintiff 
deserves to be considered.   
</p><p id="p_5">4.              In order to establish the claim, the plaintiff has placed on the file 
the following documents:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">              i. Certificate of Incorporation

 DECISION: DECREED

</p><p id="p_8">6.              There is no relief claimed by the plaintiff which does not fall within 
the ambit of the provisions of Order XXXVII CPC.
</p><p id="p_9">7.              Since, no appearance has been filed by the defendant within the 
stipulated period of ten days from the date of service of summons, hence in 
view of Order XXXVII Rule 2(3), CPC, the allegations in the plaint are deemed 
to be admitted 
</p><p id="p_10">8.              The documents placed on record by the plaintiff establish the fact 
that a written contract was executed between the parties. The defendant failed 
to pay the amount raised. The details of the statement of account of defendant 
show that the defendant   is liable to pay a sum of Rs. 8,336/­. The plaintiff is 
therefore entitled to a decree for the sum of Rs 8,336/­ against the defendant.
</p><p id="p_11">9.              In addition to the principal amount, the plaintiff has claimed an 
interest @ of 18% per annum as pendente lite as well as future interest. Since, 
the suit has been decreed under Order XXXVII Rule 2(3), CPC, future interest 
can not be awarded. Further, the interest claimed by the plaintiff is exorbitant. 
Accordingly  the  suit  of  the  plaintiff  is decreed  against  the  defendant  for  Rs 
8,336/­   along   with   10%   per   annum   pendente   lite   interest   till   the   date   of 
preparation of decree. Plaintiff is also entitled to the costs. Decree sheet be 
drawn   accordingly.   File   after   due   completion,   paging   and   indexing   be 
consigned to record room.
