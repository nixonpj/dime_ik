<p id="p_1">                                 The petitioner has preferred the instant petition for the grant of

                 concession of regular bail, in a case registered against him along with his

                 other main co-accused namely, Navraj Singh @ Mota son of Jaswant Singh,

                 Monu son of Avtar Singh, Vicky son of Satnam Singh and 5/6 other

                 unknown persons, vide FIR No. 16 dated 13.04.2014, on accusation of

                 having committed the offences punishable under Sections 307, 324, 506,

                 148 r/w <a href="/doc/999134/" id="a_1">Section 149</a> IPC, by the police of Police Station Qadian, Tehsil

                 the entire matter, to my mind, the present petition for regular bail deserves

                 to be accepted in this context.
</p>
<p id="p_4">                 4.            Precisely, the prosecution, inter alia, claimed that on

                 12.04.2014, all the accused caused injuries to complainant Sarabjot Singh

                 @ Sibu and Sukhwinder Singh @ Laddi injured-PW, with their respective

                 knives (Kirches). It is not a matter of dispute that the main injury on the

                 person of complainant Sarabjot Singh, which is subject matter of offence

                 punishable u/s 307 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_2">IPC</a>, is attributed to main accused Navraj Singh @ Mota

                 (non-petitioner). The petitioner was stated to have given a knife blow, which

                 landed on left thigh of Sukhwinder Singh @ Laddi injured PW. The injury

                 attributed to him (petitioner) is simple in nature and on non vital part.

                 During the course of investigation, Vijay, similarly situated co-accused of

                 the petitioner was found innocent and exonerated by the police for the

                 reasons best known to it. In that eventuality, as to whether the provision of

                 vicarious liability, as contemplated u/s 149 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_3">IPC</a> is attracted to the facts of

                 this case against the petitioner or not, inter-alia, would be a moot point to be

                 decided during the course of trial by the trial Court.

</p><p id="p_5">                 5.            Moreover, petitioner was arrested on 16.07.2014. Since then,

                 he is in judicial custody and no useful purpose would be served to further

                 detain him in jail. There is no history of his previous conviction in any other

                 criminal case. Even since the prosecution has not yet examined a single

                 witness, so, the final conclusion of trial will naturally take a long time.

</p><p id="p_6">                 6.            Not only that Jasmeet Singh @ Monu, similarly situated co-

                 accused of the petitioner was granted the concession of regular bail, by way

                 of order dated 29.05.2014, rendered in CRM-M-18089 of 2014 by this

                 Court. Therefore, I see no reason not to extend the same benefit of regular

                 bail to the present petitioner as well under the similar set of circumstances.

                 totality of facts and circumstances, emanating from the record, as discussed

                 here-in-above and without commenting further anything on merits, lest it

                 may prejudice the case of either side, during the course of trial of main case,

                 the instant petition for regular bail is accepted. The petitioner is ordered to

                 be released on bail on his furnishing adequate bail and surety bonds to the

                 satisfaction of the trial Court.

                 been so recorded for a limited purpose of deciding the present petition for
