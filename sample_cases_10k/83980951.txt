           HON'BLE DR.JUSTICE VINEET KOTHARI


Mr. Hemut Dutt, for the petitioner.
Mr. S.R.Paliwal for the respondent Department.


BY THE COURT:</pre>



<p id="p_1">1.     The petitioner, a Ranger in the Forest Department, has

challenged the impugned order Annex.37 dated 18/12/1997 by which

the punishment of withholding of two grade increments without

cumulative effect, a minor punishment, was imposed upon the

petitioner by the disciplinary authority on the basis of the charge no.2

found proved against the petitioner. The said order came to be

upheld by the appellate authority vide Annex.40 dated 19/4/2000 and

by the reviewing authority also vide order Annex.45 dated 25/1/2002.



</p><p id="p_2">2.     In the earlier round of litigation, the punishment imposed upon

the petitioner was set aside and quashed by this Court while allowing
                       SBCWP No.2635/02 - Karan Singh Tak vs. State &amp; ors.
                     SBCWP No. 2602/<a href="/doc/1659434/" id="a_1">02 - Karan Singh Tak vs. State &amp; Ors</a>.
</p><p id="p_3">                                                  Judgment dt:16/9/2014

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                  2/7</span>


SBCWP No.788/93 - Shri Karan Singh Tak vs.State of Rajasthan

&amp; ors. on 4/3/1997 (Annex.7) directing the respondents to proceed

further with the de novo enquiry and also directed the petitioner to

cooperate in the said enquiry. The said de novo enquiry was to be

conducted either by the Principal Officer not below the rank of Chief

Conservator of Forests or by an officer not below the rank of

Conservator of Forests. In pursuance of these directions, the said

fresh enquiry was held against the petitioner but in the meanwhile

the petitioner also filed contempt petition before this Court, namely;

SB Civil Contempt Petition No. 240/97 arising out of the aforesaid

writ petition No.788/93 &amp; the learned Single Judge of this Court

directed personal presence of the respondent contemnors             vide

order dated 5/9/1997 in SB Civil Misc. Application No. 203/1997. The

petitioner during this contempt proceedings also filed additional

affidavit (page 142 of the paper book), a copy of which is placed at

Annex.12 dated 18/9/1997) in which he alleged that the respondent

contemnor indirectly threatened him of dire consequences             and

pressurized him to withdraw the contempt petition. In this

background, in pursuance of the directions of this Court the present

proceedings were concluded against the petitioner and as against

four charges, only one charge was found to be proved i.e. charge

no.2 vide page 279 internal page 8 of the paper book. The charge

against the petitioner was that while working as Ranger in the Forest

Department at Beawar under the D.P.A.P. Scheme in Bayakheda,

Soniyana and Lotiyana in the area of about 100 Hectares, he had

shown about 21,000 and 28,000 pit holes dug for the purpose of
                       SBCWP No.2635/02 - Karan Singh Tak vs. State &amp; ors.
                     SBCWP No. 2602/<a href="/doc/1659434/" id="a_2">02 - Karan Singh Tak vs. State &amp; Ors</a>.
</p><p id="p_4">                                                  Judgment dt:16/9/2014

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                  3/7</span>


plantation   for the said afforestation scheme between the period

January, 1987 to March, 1987 but in the         subsequent inspection

carried out by the concerned authorities in the month of October-

November, 1987, about 6-7 months thereafter, it was found that

17,966 pit holes were less in number and thus the petitioner caused

financial loss of Rs.20,122/- to the respondent State Government.

The said inspection was carried out by two persons namely; Shri

Virendra Singh, Assistant Conservator of Forest and Shri Jatan

Singh Karnawat, Assistant Conservator of Forest and on the basis of

various oral evidence, the said charge was found to be proved and

consequently the disciplinary authority imposed the aforesaid

punishment of withholding of two grade increments without

cumulative effect, which is stated to have been upheld by the

appellate authority and review authority and being aggrieved by the

same the petitioner had preferred this writ petition before this Court.

The connected writ petition No. 2602/2002 - Karan Singh Tak vs.

State of Rajasthan &amp; Ors. was filed by the petitioner for non-

consideration of his case for promotion to the next higher post in

view of the punishment order, which is challenged in the present writ

petition.
</p>
<p id="p_5">

</p><p id="p_6">3.     Learned counsel for the petitioner, Mr. Hemant Dutt submitted

that the impugned order passed by the disciplinary authority, namely;

Chief Conservator of Forest, Mr. S.P.Mathur, is malafide and

unsustainable because the same was passed by the authority who

was biased against the petitioner having been summoned by this
                       SBCWP No.2635/02 - Karan Singh Tak vs. State &amp; ors.
                     SBCWP No. 2602/<a href="/doc/1659434/" id="a_3">02 - Karan Singh Tak vs. State &amp; Ors</a>.
</p><p id="p_7">                                                  Judgment dt:16/9/2014

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                  4/7</span>


Court in the aforesaid contempt petition. Learned counsel for the

petitioner also submitted that the inspection was carried out by the

two authorities after six months of the actual work undertaken under

the supervision of the petitioner and the finding recorded by the

enquiry officer that upon inspection lesser number of pit holes were

found is unsustainable finding due to long lapse of time in between

the date of the work and the date of inspection and also that no

proper marking was made at the time of inspection and the

inspection was done by marking the pit holes by foot, whereas, it

should have been done by marking the pit holes by the line powder.

He, therefore, submitted that the punishment order deserves to be

quashed by this Court.
</p>
<p id="p_8">

</p><p id="p_9">4.    On the other hand, Mr. S.R.Paliwal appearing for the

respondent Department supported the impugned order and urged

that the enquiry has been concluded and impugned order has been

passed by the Chief Conservator of Forest under the directions of

this Court dated 4/3/1997 and there is no bias against the petitioner.

He also submitted that the punishment is not disproportionate to the

alleged misconduct and in view of the dereliction of duties

established    by   the   respondent    Department,     the   impugned

punishment order is justifiable and also upheld by the higher

authorities.
</p>
<p id="p_10">

</p><p id="p_11">5.    Having heard the learned counsels, this Court is of the opinion

that the impugned orders are liable to be quashed &amp; set aside and
                       SBCWP No.2635/02 - Karan Singh Tak vs. State &amp; ors.
                     SBCWP No. 2602/<a href="/doc/1659434/" id="a_4">02 - Karan Singh Tak vs. State &amp; Ors</a>.
</p><p id="p_12">                                                  Judgment dt:16/9/2014

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                  5/7</span>


the writ petition deserves to be allowed.
</p>
<p id="p_13">

</p><p id="p_14">6.    This Court does not find any good ground to sustain the

finding recorded against the petitioner simply for the reason of long

lapse of time between the actual work undertaken under the

supervision of the petitioner and the inspection carried out for

verifying the work done. The pit holes dug for the purpose of

pantation were verified after six months and if it is verified in the

manner stated to have been done, such finding ex-facie cannot be

believed. The charge of financial loss to the State Government was

also levelled against the petitioner as part of charge no.2, amounting

to Rs.20,122/-, but the disciplinary authority has not passed any

order seeking to recover the said amount from the petitioner, while

on the earlier occasion in the similar enquiry initiated against the

petitioner, vide punishment order Annex.6 dated 26/12/1992,

recovery of Rs.10,000/- was directed against the petitioner. This

prima facie shows that the disciplinary authority also could not

connect the financial loss allegedly against the respondent State on

account of misconduct on the part of the petitioner. The lapse of six

months period between the actual work done and inspection carried

out by the two authorities is sufficient to render such exercise a

futility because the period in which such pit holes were dug cannot

be ascertained upon inspection after 6-7 months. Nothing prevented

the concerned inspection authorities to carry out the inspection

immediately after the work done report was submitted by the

petitioner in contemporary period in the month of January to March,
                       SBCWP No.2635/02 - Karan Singh Tak vs. State &amp; ors.
                     SBCWP No. 2602/<a href="/doc/1659434/" id="a_5">02 - Karan Singh Tak vs. State &amp; Ors</a>.
</p><p id="p_15">                                                  Judgment dt:16/9/2014

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                  6/7</span>


1987. The background of the case that the impugned order of

punishment has been passed by the same authority, who was one of

the contemnors in the contempt petition, namely; Mr. S.C.Mathur

also does not rule out the chance of bias against the petitioner. It is

well settled principle that the fairness and justice should not only be

done but it should appear to have been done. If the said authority

was arrayed as contemnor in the contempt petition and this Court

considered it appropriate to summon the respondent contemnors

coupled with the fact that petitioner filed additional affidavit

(Annex.12) that he was threatened of dire consequences and

pressurized to withdraw the contempt petition, that affidavit having

remained unrebutted on the side of respondents raises a fair amount

of doubt in the mind of this Court as to whether the same authority

ought to have passed the punishment order against the petitioner or

not. When authorities of the same level, as permitted by this Court in

the previous order while directing the fresh enquiry, were available,it

is desirable by the respondent Department to exclude the person,

who was arrayed as contemnor in the contempt petition filed by the

petitioner before this Court and allowed some other parallel authority

to undertake the disciplinary proceedings and pass fresh order, if

any.
</p>
<p id="p_16">7.     The perusal of the orders passed by the higher authorities also

in appellate jurisdiction as well as in review jurisdiction reveal that

the same were passed in mechanical manner without any

independent application of mind on the aforesaid aspects. Said

orders are, therefore, unsustainable.
</p><p id="p_17">                         SBCWP No.2635/02 - Karan Singh Tak vs. State &amp; ors.
                       SBCWP No. 2602/<a href="/doc/1659434/" id="a_6">02 - Karan Singh Tak vs. State &amp; Ors</a>.
</p><p id="p_18">                                                    Judgment dt:16/9/2014

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                    7/7</span>


</p><p id="p_19">8.      Accordingly, the writ petition no. 2635/2002 challenging the

impugned order of punishment as well as appellate &amp; review order is

liable to be allowed and same is hereby allowed. The impugned

order of punishment Annex.37 dated 18/12/1997,              the appellate

order Annex.40 dated 19/4/2000 and the review order Annex.45

dated 25/1/2002 are hereby quashed and set aside.



</p><p id="p_20">9.      The connected writ petition No.2602/2002 is also disposed of

and the respondents are directed to consider the case of the

petitioner for promotion, which was withheld and rejected in view of

the punishment order, in accordance with law. The petitioner is

retiring in near future in December,2015, therefore, the consideration

of the case of the petitioner for promotion may be expeditiously

done, preferably within a period of six months from today.



</p><p id="p_21">10.     With these observations and directions, both the writ petitions

are disposed of. Copy of the order be sent to the parties concerned

forthwith. No costs.
