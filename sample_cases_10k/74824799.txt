</p><p id="p_2">         1.            The present appeal is preferred by the
         appellant - original claimant seeking enhancement
         of compensation awarded by learned Motor Accident
         Claims       Tribunal        (Auxi),             Vadodara           by       impugned
         judgment         and      award      dated           23.5.2014             in       Motor
         Accident Claim Petition No.1203 of 2003.
</p>

<p id="p_3">         2.            By way of preferring the present appeal,
         the    appellant          has,     inter           alia,       contended              that
         learned       Tribunal       has       adopted           very        conservative
         view while awarding the amount of compensation.
         It    is    contended        that          compensation                awarded               by
         learned Tribunal on various other heads is also
         on lower side which is required to be enhanced in
         view of the grounds mentioned in the appeal memo.
         Learned Tribunal has awarded very meager amount
         of compensation and urged that there is every
         chance of enhancement of compensation and prayed
         to enhance the amount of compensation.
</p>

<p id="p_4">         3.            The        short    facts            giving         rise         to       the
         present       appeal       are     that         on     3.6.2003            at       about
         11.30 am the claimant was going from Chhotaudepur
         to Bodeli in luxury bus No.GJ 6 U 9863. At that
         time, due to rash and negligent driving of the
         driver of luxury bus, the back portion of the bus
         got jumped and jerked due to which the claimant
         received injuries as well as fracture on right
         leg.    Therefore,          the      appellant             filed         the        claim
         petition         before      learned             Tribunal           and         learned
         Tribunal         delivered         the          impugned          judgment              and

<p id="p_5">         4.          Heard            Ms.Pooja             Hotchandani,                  learned
         advocate for the appellant and Mr.Palak Thakkar,
         learned advocate for respondent No.3 - insurance
         company. Though served, none appears for rest of
         the respondents.
</p>

<p id="p_6">         5.          This Court has gone through the impugned
         judgment       and       award     as          well       as      material            made
         available in the nature of paper book to this
         Court.
</p>

<p id="p_7">         6.          At         the   onset,            Ms.Hotchandani,                  learned
         advocate for the appellant - original claimant
         has stated that the appellant is restricting her
         appeal      to         the     question              of        enhancement                    of
         compensation only and hence, this Court has also
         concentrated upon the said issue only.
</p>

<p id="p_8">         7.          There appears no dispute as regards to
         the age of the injured claimant as it is decided
         by learned Tribunal as 32 years. The claimant has
         pleaded that she was earning Rs.2000/- per month.
         However,         learned         Tribunal,                 considering                   her
         occupation             as      well            as         other             attending
         circumstances            and    reckoning              minimum            wage,          has
         taken income of the claimant as Rs.2300/- per
         month.       Indisputably,                as         per          the         consent,
         disability of the claimant is assessed at 7.5%.
         Therefore, considering her age and income, future

                   C/FA/1/2015                                                 JUDGMENT




         loss     of     income         may      be         awarded          by       applying
         appropriate multiplier. Taking into consideration
         disability of the claimant to be 7.5% body as a
         whole, lumpsum Rs.100/- per month is calculated
         by the learned Tribunal. If we may work out, the
         amount would come to Rs.172.5 per month (7.5 of
         Rs.2300 = Rs.172.5) and annual amount would come
         to Rs.2070/- (Rs.172.5 x 12 = Rs.2070/-). In the
         facts of the present case, appropriate multiplier
         would be 16 and hence, the amount would come to
         Rs.33,120/-.
</p>

<p id="p_9">         8.            The claimant is also entitled to receive
         non-pecuniary                benefits           in        the          nature                of
         conventional heads, i.e. medical expenses, food,
         attendance, transportation which are quantified
         at Rs.5000/-, Rs.2300/- Rs.1100/- and Rs.2000/-
         respectively            by    learned          Tribunal.             Taking           into
         consideration            all     above         heads         which         are       non-
         pecuniary in nature and the fact that soonafter
         the incident, the injured claimant has to remain
         as indoor patient for about 12 days and she was
         also operated over her right ankle and nailing
         was also carried out over the fracture sustained
         by her due to which she has also undergone pain,
         shock and suffering and thereafter she must not
         be     able     to      walk      for          three        months,            lumpsum
         compensation inclusive of all on the above heads
         is quantified at Rs.25,000/-.                           Thus, the claimant
         is     entitled          to     receive            in      all         Rs.58,120/-</p><pre id="pre_2">
