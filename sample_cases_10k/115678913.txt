<pre id="pre_1">            THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH

                      M.Cr.C. No. 37770/2019
                (Jaan Mohammad Vs. The State of M.P.)
                                          1

Jabalpur, Dated: 18.10.2019
      Mr. Sandeep Kumar Jain, learned counsel for the applicant.
      Mr.      R.D.   Singh,        learned    Panel      Lawyer     for   the
respondent/State.</pre>
<p id="p_1">      Heard on this third bail application filed under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_1">Section 439</a>
of Cr.P.C. on behalf of the applicant in connection with Crime
No.51/2019      registered     at     Police    Station    Kareli,    District
Narsinghpur for offences punishable under <a href="/doc/704277/" id="a_2">Sections 8</a>/<a href="/doc/1566465/" id="a_3">21</a> and <a href="/doc/1252855/" id="a_4">29</a> of
the N.D.P.S. Act.
</p><p id="p_2">      The case of the prosecution against the applicant, in short, is
that applicant along with other co-accused Mahendra Kaurav @
Guddu was having smack powder, going to sell that smack powder
in packets to some consumers on a motor-cycle not bearing any
registration    number.   Police      after    receiving    the    information
strategically intercepted the motor-cycle. After following the
process, Police searched Jaan Mohammad and he was found with
narcotic substance i.e. smack powder.
</p><p id="p_3">      Learned counsel appeared on behalf of the applicant submits
that applicant was having a medium quantity of smack powder. He
also submits that recently Hon'ble the Apex Court in case of Arif
Khan @ Agha Khan Vs. State of Uttarakhand reported in (AIR
2018 SC 2123) has held that "if Police searched a person and found
narcotic substance, it is not a compliance of <a href="/doc/1046310/" id="a_5">Section 15</a> of NDPS
Act"; therefore, it has been prayed that the applicant may be
enlarged on bail.
</p><p id="p_4">      Learned Panel Lawyer for the respondent/State, on the other
hand, has vehemently opposed the submissions advanced by the
learned counsel for the applicant and submitted that second
application for bail of the co-accused has been dismissed by this
Court, who was the driver of the motor-cycle. It is the applicant,
                                 THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH

                                                M.Cr.C. No. 37770/2019
                                          (Jaan Mohammad Vs. The State of M.P.)
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                               2</span>
             who was having contraband in his possession; therefore, he prayed
             for dismissal of this application for bail.
</p><p id="p_5">                       Having heard learned counsel for the parties, it emerges out
             that no doubt, whether compliance of <a href="/doc/1046310/" id="a_6">Section 15</a> of NDPS Act has
             been complied by the prosecution or not. It has to be decided on
             the merits of the case, but prima-facie it is reflected that the
             applicant was having a medium quantity of smack powder in
             pocket and going to sell that smack powder to some consumers.
             Grave offence has been found against the applicant.
</p><p id="p_6">                       Keeping in view of the facts and circumstances of the case,
             particularly, looking to the gravity of offence, in the opinion of this
             Court, it is not a fit case for grant of bail.
</p><p id="p_7">                       Consequently, this application for grant of bail under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_7">Section
             439</a> of Cr.P.C. filed on behalf of the applicant Jaan Mohammad,
             deserves to be and is accordingly dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_8">                                                              (Vishnu Pratap Singh Chauhan)
                                                                          Judge
