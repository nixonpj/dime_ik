    of Rs. 50,000/­ from the complainant and to discharge the said liability the 

    accused has issued a cheque bearing no. 348306 dated 03.01.2008 for Rs, 

    48,000/­ drawn on Indian Overseas Bank, Golf Link Branch 70, Golf Links 

    New Delhi 110030 which is the cheque in dispute with undertaking that the 

    same would be honoured at the time of its presentation and having trust on 

    the   accused,   complainant   accepted   the   same.   It   is   averred   that   as   per 

    directions of the accused when the cheque was presented, it was returned 

    back   unpaid   with   remarks   "Funds   Insufficient'   vide   return   memo   dated 

    20.03.08, thereafter when the complainant tried to contact the accused, he 

    intentionally   and   deliberately   avoided   the   same.     Thereafter,   the 

    complainant   served   a   legal   notice   dated   01.04.08   through   his   counsel 

    through Registered post and UPC but despite service accused failed to make 

    the payment towards the loan amount  and thus, made himself liable for the 

    offense punishable u/s 138 of the <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_4">Negotiable Instruments Act</a>, 1881, hence 

    present complaint case was filed.

    08.09.08. In his statement the accused stated that he has only taken a loan of 

    Rs. 10,000/­ from the complainant in May 2005 and not in 2008, however 

    he  has   denied   that  he  has  ever  taken  any  loan of Rs.  50,000/­  from  the 

    complainant.  He further stated that he has taken taken the said loan of Rs. 

    10,000/­  from the complainant  for giving fee of his children and not for 

    operation   of  kidney   of   his   brother­in­law,  however  admitted  that  he had 

    issued   a   cheque   bearing   no   348306   dated   03.01.08   drawn   on   Indian 

    Overseas Bank and he has repaid a sum of Rs. 2000/­. The accused further 

    submitted  that the said cheque was blank and it was not filled up by his 

    friend   and   he  only   signed   the  same.    He further  admitted  the  receipt  of 

    demand notice issued by the complainant, however he submitted that the 

    cheque was not issued in discharge of any liability, hence the complaint was 

    liable to be dismissed.  Accused also showed his willingness to led defence 

    evidence, however despite opportunity no DE was led and opportunity for 

    same was closed by my Ld Predecessor and the matter was fixed for final 

    arguments.

    given my thoughtful consideration to the submissions advanced on behalf of

    written submissions filed on behalf of parties.

      prosecution has to prove the following:
</p>
<p id="p_13">(a)                 That a cheque have been presented in a bank within  period of 6 

months from the date on which it is drawn or within a period of its validity. 

</p><p id="p_14">(b)                 The said cheque should have been issued for discharge in whole 

or in part of debt or other liability. 
</p>
<p id="p_15">(c)                 The cheque should have been returned by the bank unpaid due to 

reason of insufficient funds or that it exceed amount arranged to be paid from 

that accused.

<p id="p_16">(d)                  The payee or holder in due course makes the demand of payment 

of the said loan of money by giving a notice in writing to the drawer of cheque 

within 15 days of the receipt of information by him from the bank regarding 

the return of the cheque. 
</p>
<p id="p_17">(e)                 The drawer of said cheque fails to make the payment to the payee

the present matter accused has specifically admitted in his statement u/s 313 

<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_7">Cr.P.C</a> that he has issued  the cheque bearing no. 348306 dated 03.01.08 drawn 

on Indian Overseas Bank in favour of the complainant which is the cheque in 

dispute.   Accused further submitted that he has taken only an amount of Rs. 

10,000/­ from the complainant as loan and not Rs. 50,000/­ as alleged.   He 

further  submitted  that  he already  repaid  paid sum  of Rs.  2000/­  out of the 

same. Even while cross examining the complainant same suggestion was given 

by the accused that there was a transaction between them  only for a sum of 

Rs.   10,000/­   only.   The   complainant,  however   in   his  cross  examination   has 

admitted that he has received Rs. 2000/­ from the accused out of total amount 

of Rs. 50,000/­. The complainant has admitted that it was a security cheque. 

The   accused   however,   failed   to   prove   on   record   that   the   loan   transaction 

between them   was for   Rs. 10,000/­ and not for Rs. 50,000/­.;   He has not 

examined   any   witness   to   prove   the   contentions   raised   and   in   view   of   the 

specific admission  the complainant  is entitled to the legal  presumptions  u/s 

118 (a) and <a href="/doc/268919/" id="a_8">section 139</a> of the Act which provide as under:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">                 <a href="/doc/517539/" id="a_9">Section 118</a> (a):     Until the contrary is proved, the presumption  

    shall   be  made  that   every  negotiable  instrument   was  made  or  drawn  for  

    consideration and that every such instrument, when it has been accepted,  

    endorsed, negotiated or transferred, was accepted, endorsed, negotiated or  
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">   CC No.    884/1                                          7</span>

    that the holder of the a cheque received the cheque of the nature referred to  

    in <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_11">section 138</a> for the discharge, in whole or in part, of any debt or other  

    liability.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">    10.          From   the   abovesaid,   it   is   very   clear   that   the   presumption   of 

    consideration  exists infavour of the complainant. The accused  has totally 

    failed to rebutt the said presumption occurring in favour of the complainant. 

    Admittedly, the accused  was an educated person working in a bank, hence 

    his contention that he has issued a blank cheque is also of no help to him. 

    The complainant, however, admitted that the cheque in dispute was given 

    towards a security, however, in this regard he has   relied upon   judgment 

    reported as 2010 (4) Civil Court Cases 255 (Bombay) Bombay High Court 

    titled as Harshad Shambhulal Sheth Vs. Sangeeta Rajesh Varma"  Wherein 

    the Hon'ble Bombay High court has held that:
