J U D G M E N T:
</pre>

<p id="p_1">           The facts of the case in nutshell are that petitioner Shri Anil

                                                                 Contd....2.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                   : 2 :</span>



<p id="p_2">Sidana has filed the present petition u/s 372 of <a href="/doc/1450343/" id="a_1">Indian Succession Act</a> for

grant of Succession Certificate in respect of the debts and securities of

deceased persons namely Sh.Abnashi Ram and Smt.Sheela Sidana.
</p>


<p id="p_3">2.         After presentation of the petition, notice of the same was duly
given to the general public by way of publication in newspaper
''Statesman'', dated 09.11.2006, but none has appeared from the general
public to file any objections.
</p>

<p id="p_4">3.         Thereafter, petitioner Shri Anil Sidana was examined as PW-
1 in the matter.   He has stated in his evidence that deceased Abnashi
Ram and Smt.Sheela Sidana were his parents.             They expired on
05.2.2003 and 24.6.2003 respectively. The witness has proved on record
their death certificates as Ex. PW-1/1 and Ex.PW-1/2. He further stated
that deceased persons have left behind besides him, three sons and one
daughter, who all are respondents no.2 to 5 in this petition and have filed
their "No Objections" to the grant of Succession Certificate in his
favour. He further stated that mother of the deceased Abnashi Ram had
predeceased him.     He further stated that deceased persons made no
WILL during their life time and they were ordinarily resident of Delhi.
He further stated that deceased persons have left behind a saving account
with PO Defence Colony, the copy of passbook of the said account has
been proved on record as Ex. PW-1/3.
</p>

<p id="p_5">4.                 Therefore, in view of the above, I am of the considered
opinion that there is no impediment for grant of Succession Certificate in
                                                                Contd....3.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                   : 3 :</span>



<p id="p_6">favour of petitioner Shri Anil Sidana in respect of the debts and
securities of deceased persons namely Sh. Abnashi Ram and Smt.Sheela
Sidana.   I accordingly direct that a Succession Certificate be issued in
favour of petitioner Shri Anil Sidana in respect of the debts and
securities of deceased persons namely Sh.Abnashi Ram and Smt.Sheela
Sidana in terms of Ex.PW-1/3, on filing of requisite court fee and on
furnishing of an Indemnity Bond with one surety within 15 days.
</p>

<p id="p_7">           No further orders are required to be passed in the matter.
