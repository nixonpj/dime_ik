HONOURABLE SRI JUSTICE A.RAJASHEKER REDDY             

C.M.A. No. 1018 OF 2014  

JUDGMENT:   
</pre>
<p id="p_1">          This Civil Miscellaneous Appeal is filed by the appellant
against order and decree dated 25.08.2014 in I.A.No.147 of 2013
in O.S.No.46 of 2013 passed by the I Additional District and
Sessions Judge, Krishna District, partly allowing the petition
granting temporary injunction restraining the appellant herein
from using numbers 2222 on his seed packings till disposal of
the suit and dismissed the petition in so far as the relief of
restraining the respondent from conducting of Deepika2222
paddy seeds. 
</p><p id="p_2">2.      Facts necessary for disposal of the above Civil
Miscellaneous Appeal are as follows:
</p><p id="p_3">        The respondent herein is the plaintiff in O.S.No.46 of 2013
filed the suit for (a) declaring that by manufacturing, producing,
selling, offering for sale or otherwise, distribution, in wholesale or
retail, and advertising, promoting, and directly or indirectly
dealing with trademark DEEPIKA 2222 which consisting of
similar or deceptively similar marks with falsifying and having
falsely applying trademark and marks having the similar
description, colour, writing style, pronunciation, lable, packing
and/or using any other name akin to R.S.2222 or R.S and
2222 in the business of agricultural seeds is an infringement
and passing off and (b) permanent injunction restraining that the
appellant herein, who is defendant in the above suit, from using
any other name akin to R.S.2222 or R.S. and 2222 in the
business of agricultural seeds and also a decree for the
permanent injunction restraining the appellant/defendant by
themselves, their servants, officers, their agents, distributors, or
any and all persons claiming through them or acting for and on
their behalf, from manufacturing, producing, selling, offering for
sale, tenders or otherwise distribution, in wholesale or retail, or
advertising, promoting and in any manner, directly or indirectly
dealing with trademark R.S.2222 in relation to the agricultural
seeds and being based on information that is proprietary to the
respondent and without the express written consent of the
respondent herein in any manner whatsoever.   Along with the
suit, the respondent/plaintiff filed I.A.No.147 of 2013 seeking
temporary injunction restraining the appellant from selling the
paddy seeds Deepika 2222 variety.
</p><p id="p_4">3.      The respondent/plaintiff is a company registered under the
name and style of Reshma Chemicals Private Limited under the 
<a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_1">Companies Act</a>, 1956 in the year 1989, and stated to be engaged 
in the research, development manufacture, production and
marketing of various kinds of seeds including the paddy seeds of
new varieties having specific characters of short slender seeds,
high pest tolerance, high yield characters of paddy and one such
invented variety of paddy crop seeds with brand name R.S.2222
and got it registered vide No.1248597, dated 10th November,
2003, Trademark Registry, Chennai, claiming the date of using of
the mark from April, 2001 and that by virtue of Section 31(1) of
the Trademarks Act, 1999, the registration of the trademark shall
be the prima facie evidence for all the legal proceedings to
maintain the rights of the respondent for the registration of their
trademark.  It is stated that the respondent/plaintiff is
authorized to sell the said seed in State of Andhra Pradesh
(presently Andhra Pradesh and Telangana States), Maharashtra 
and Karnataka. 
</p><p id="p_5">4.      It is further stated that, the appellant/defendant company
also started marketing the paddy seeds with brand name 
Deepika 2222 with similar characteristics of
respondents/plaintiffs trade marked seed of RS2222.  It is
stated that the farmers are purchasing Deepika2222 variety
under the impression that they are purchasing RS2222 by
confusing with 2222, resulting in huge loss to the business
prospects of respondent/plaintiff.   It is stated that the
appellant/defendant company is infringing the patent right of the
respondent/plaintiff and marketing and selling Deepika2222,
which is nothing but imitation of respondents/plaintiffs brand
i.e., RS2222 variety and sought for temporary injunction
restraining the respondent/defendant from manufacturing and
selling Deepika2222 variety.
</p><p id="p_6">5.      The appellant/defendant filed counter affidavit denying the
averments of the affidavit filed in support of the petition stating
that the appellant is having its own research wing, development
etc., and it is incorporated with Registrar of Companies as Rohini
Seeds Private Limited, obtained license for research development,
production, marketing of various types of seeds.  It is stated that
after obtaining necessary licence from the competent authorities,
they started marketing Deepika2222 from the year 2012 and
that 2222 is only a generic word and that their Deepika2222
is not similar to that of the respondents RS2222.  It is stated
that Morphological characters of Deepika2222 are certified and
certificate to that effect is also issued by the competent authority.
It is further stated that the appellant is one of the group of
companies of Crystal Crop dealing in business of invention,
production and marketing of various seeds having licence, and
doing seeds business in the State of Andhra Pradesh (Presently
Andhra Pradesh and Telangana) Maharashtra, Tamilnadu,  
Gujarath, Rajasthan, Panjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and other
States.  It is stated that their distributors are persons other than
respondent/plaintiff as such, there is no confusion to the ryoths
in purchasing RS2222 and that they can differentiate
Deepika2222 from respondents seed.  Therefore, the
respondent/plaintiff cannot claim exclusive rights of RS2222
and that the same is not protected under Plant Variety and
Farmers Rights Act.  It is further stated that the packings are of
different fonts, different style, design of packing is also completely
different, as such, ryots can easily identify their respective seeds.
It is further stated that there is no cause of action for the suit
and cannot maintain the suit.  It is stated that the appellant has
not violated any of the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_2">Trade Marks Act</a> and that
the respondents business was not affected by appellants selling
Deepika2222.  It is stated that the respondent has not made
out a prima facie case or irreparable loss, muchless infringement
of trademark and sought for dismissal of the petition.
</p><p id="p_7">6.      Before the Court below, the appellant and respondent did
not adduce any oral evidence, but they produced documentary 
evidence i.e., the appellant marked Exs.R1 to R8, while the
respondent marked Exs.P1 to P23.  However, the Court below, 
having considered the rival contentions of the parties in the light
of the material placed, by order dated 25.08.2014 partly allowed
the petition by granting temporary injunction restraining the
appellant company from using numbers 2222 on its seed 
packing till disposal of the suit.  Aggrieved by the same, the
present Appeal is filed.
</p><p id="p_8">7.      Heard Smt. K.Lalitha, learned counsel for the appellant as
well as Sri Narasaiah Golla, learned counsel appearing for the
respondent.
</p><p id="p_9">8.      Learned counsel for the appellant while reiterating the
submissions made before the Court below submits that there are
several public and private institutions which will research and
develop units in paddy and there are several varieties for
commercial cultivation in same maturity group and the grain
quality, hence, the paddy is not new invention to claim any right
by the respondent.  She further submits that the name 2222 is
a generic numerical word and since the appellant is also doing
business in paddy seeds, the respondent cannot have exclusive
right to use those words and there is no similarity between trade
marks of appellant and respondent and that it cannot be said
that that the trade name used by the appellant is causing or is
likely to cause deception in the minds of farmers or confusion in
the customers mind and that business of respondent is adversely
affected by use of the name of Deepika2222 by the appellant.
She further contends that when an action for infringement of
trademark is complained, the onus would be on the respondent 
to establish that the trademark used by the appellant in the
course of trade in the goods in respect of which his mark is
registered is deceptively similar and there is likelihood of
confusion or deception arising from similarity of trademark or
logo or words used by the respondent.  She further contended
that the respondent has not made out any prima facie case or
irreparable loss that could be caused to the respondent muchless
infringement of trade mark.  In support of her contention, she
relied on the judgment reported in Trinethra Super Retail Private
Limited, Hyderabad rep. by its Company Secretary Mr. Vinod K.Saraf v.
Mee Trinethra Trading Private Limited, Hyderabad, rep. by its Director,
Mr.Pilli guru Prasad Anand and others  She thus contended that the
Court below committed an error in granting temporary injunction
partly allowing the petition restraining the appellants from using
2222 and hence, prayed that the order dated 25.08.2014 in
I.A.No.147 of 2013 in O.S.No.46 of 2013 be set aside and the
C.M.A. be allowed.
</p><p id="p_10">9.          On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondent
reiterated the contents in the counter affidavit filed in the Appeal
and submitted that the appellants marketing Deepika2222 is
nothing but infringement of Trade Mark of their company.  He
would further contend that after considering the documentary
evidence produced on either side, the Court below has passed a
reasoned order.    He further submitted that in case of trademark
infringement of deceptive similarity, statements of accounts need
not be submitted showing the loss sustained by the complainant.
He would contend that the statutory provisions under <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_3">Trade
Marks Act</a> provide protection for the registered owners to take
action against the infringers.   He further submits that in
deciding whether a particular trademark is likely to deceive or
cause confusion that duty is not discharged by arriving at the
result by merely comparing it with the trade mark which is
already registered and whose proprietor is offering opposition to
the registration of the mark.  The real question to decide in such
cases is to see as to how a purchaser, who must be looked upon 
as an average man of ordinary intelligence, would react to a
particular trade mark, what association he would form by look at
the trade mark, and in what respect he would connect the trade
mark with the goods which he would be purchasing.    In support
of his contention he relied on the judgment reported in <a href="/doc/1114158/" id="a_4">Cadila
Health Care Ltd., v. Cadila Pharmaceuticals Ltd.,   He</a> would further
contend that the respondent has established prima facie case and
balance of convenience in its favour and after considering the
same, the Court below partly allowed the petition for temporary
injunction restraining the appellant from using numbers 2222
on his seed packing till the disposal of suit and permitted the
appellant herein to use Deepika only. Thus, he sought for
dismissal of Civil Miscellaneous Appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_11">10.     After scrutinizing the facts and circumstances of the case,
it is clear that there is no dispute that respondent/plaintiff
trademark is registered as RS2222 in respect of paddy and
there is also no dispute that appellant/defendant is marketing
their paddy by using mark Deepika2222.   The case of the
respondent/plaintiff is that it has incorporated in the year 2002
and started marketing RS2222 paddy from the year 2002 
onwards, whereas Deepika2222 was in research and  
development during the year 2011 when Ex.R5 licence cum  
permission is given by the Central Government and State
Government.  Thus, appellants Deepika2222 has come  
subsequently to RS2222.   As per Trade Marks Certificate,
Ex.R3 appellant/defendant was permitted on 20.01.2012 by 
which time respondent/plaintiff already invented, developed and
also marketed RS2222 variety of paddy.    Ex.P6, is a seed bag
discloses that it is a white colour HDPE bag.  Moreover, the
petitioner companys logo is in red colour with complete red
colour boarder with super print of RESHMA &amp; COMPANY and    
in white big letters company name was mentioned as Reshma  
with blue background and that behind the respondent/plaintiff
companys logo, rays type design like that of rising sun is found.
Underneath the same typed big letters RS2222 with blue colour
and below the same green colour ripe paddy full photo is found
and that the second side of the bag is in complete green colour
boarder and logo of respondent/plaintiffs company is found.
Underneath the same Reshma is mentioned with big letters with
phone number and underneath the same printed matter  
regarding paddy, manufacturing date, packing date etc., are
found and that beneath the same, the respondent/plaintiff
companys address and customer care number with big letters is
found.
</p><p id="p_12">11.           On the other hand, appellant companys Exs.R6 and R7
bag shows that on one side it is with complete green colour print
and on the top it is noted on one side with words Crystal and
another side two swords across each other.  Beneath the same 
with red and yellow boarder and all lower portion kept into Lunar
shape design with blue colour with yellow boarder are found.
There are two photos printed right side showing standing paddy
crop and the left side showing ripe paddy crop with chronicle
with many paddy seeds.  At the bottom in red colour Paddy
letters are found.  Beneath the same with yellow boarder in red
colour letters Deepika2222 small letters are printed.    On the
reverse side top is with full green colour letters crystal and
swords emblem is found.  In lower 2/3 portion Deepika2222
with red colour letters are found.  Underneath the same left side
shown paddy, and the right side truthful label describing the
manufacturing date, page number etc., and also the standards of
the seed physical purity, generic purity etc., are found.    There is
a red colour warning on white label treated with Poison, do not
use for food, feed and oil purposes is mentioned and side lower
part, appellants company logo and their company address are
printed.  At the right lower side a warning notice is also found
that the seed is confirmed with minimum standards etc., with
office number Email etc., and that the bag is 10 kgs.   Ex.P11 is
similar bag of the appellant company and the same is a carry bag
which is made with nylon thread and it is a six kgs bag with
similar type of print, but having the company name in brown
colour emblem instead of red colour.  Therefore, when the two
bags i.e., the bag of the appellant/defendant and the bag of
respondent/plaintiff are compared, there is a lot of difference
between the physical appearance of both the packing.  The trial
Court also considered the evidence and came to the conclusion
that there is lot of difference between the physical appearance of
both the bags.  It is also to be seen that the respondent/plaintiff
has not filed any third party affidavits stating that they
purchased Deepika2222 of appellants company instead of
RS2222 of respondents company mistaking the same and that  
they have incurred losses of crop, and that not having enough
yield of their expectations.  It is also to be seen that the
respondent/plaintiff has not produced the marketing statement,
production and sales statements of appellant company showing 
that respondents sales decreased as the appellants are using
words 2222.   The trial Court also found that the packings are
different, logos are different, but however, the Court below partly
allowed the injunction petition restraining the appellant from
using the words 2222, even though packings are different.
</p><p id="p_13">12.         The trial Court came to a conclusion that the appellant
cannot use the words 2222 because the same was already used  
and marketed by the respondent company since the year 2002.  
Though the trial Court clearly held that except filing Exs.P1 to
P23, respondent/plaintiff has not filed any third party affidavits
showing that they have incurred loss of crops, loss in business
etc., but still partly allowed the injunction petition restraining the
appellant from using the words 2222.  When the
respondent/plaintiff has not produced any material regarding
infringement of their trade mark, the Court below ought not have
granted injunction restricting the appellant/defendant from using
the words 2222.  In Trinethra Super Retail Private Limited,
Hyderabad rep. by its Company Secretary Mr. Vinod K.Saraf v. Mee 
Trinethra Trading Private Limited, Hyderabad, rep. by its Director,
Mr.Pilli guru Prasad Anand and others (supra), it is observed as
follows:
</p><p id="p_14">       43. When an action for infringement of trademark is complained,
the onus would be on the plaintiff to establish that the trademark
used by the defendant in the course of trade in the goods in
respect of which his mark is registered is deceptively similar and
there is likelihood of confusion or deception arising from similarity
of trademark or logo or words used by the plaintiff.  This is prima
facie case.
</p>
<p id="p_15">        47.  The courts have to take into consideration along with prima
facie case, the other two factors i.e. balance of convenience and
irreparable loss.  The plaintiff can always be compensated by
costs, if in case ultimately it is found that the defendant tried to
capture the market on the basis of the good will of the plaintiff.
</p>

<p id="p_16">           48.  A rigid invocation without contemplating elasticity in the
application of rules as to the grant of injunction might sometimes
result in hardship, which cannot be cured later.  Cases of
infringement, no doubt, do not depend on proof of actual
deception.  Yet the entire object of trademark law would be
rendered meaningless if courts were to mechanically grant
injunction relief, where no injury is shown, or shown to be a
natural result of someones use of a mark.    
</p>

<p id="p_17">        The decision cited by the learned counsel for the
respondent in <a href="/doc/1114158/" id="a_5">Cadila Health Care Ltd., v. Cadila Pharmaceuticals Ltd</a>.,
(supra) is also considered by the Division Bench of this Court in
the aforesaid decision and came to the conclusion that unless
prima facie plaintiff proves that there is deceptive alleging
infringement, injunction cannot be granted.    A person trading
with a particular mark is entitled to insist that no one else should
use that mark for trading in the same and similar commodity.  If
there is any infringement or the mark used by the other is
deceptively similar to his mark in the sense that it nearly
resembles his mark that is likely to deceive or cause confusion,
he undoubtedly can ask the Court to restrain the other to trade
with such deceptively similar mark.  However, it does not mean
that a person who has a registered trademark can stop all the
others, whose trademark has slightest similarity with his
trademark, from doing business.   The trial Court basing on the
evidence, rightly came to the conclusion that only on the ground
that RS2222 is the specific trademark of the
respondent/plaintiff.  The trial Court merely extracted the
relevant provisions of the <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_6">Trade Marks Act</a> and extracted some
paragraphs of decisions, and having found that the packing and
logos are different, but erroneously granted injunction restraining
the appellant from using the words 2222.    The court below has
also not found that the customers are likely to get confused by
the use of words Deepika2222 for making out strong prima facie
case and it is to be made out for grant of injunction. The
respondent did not produce any material to show that their
business has been adversely affected by the use of the words
Deepika2222 by the appellant, much less have filed any
affidavit stating that by the use of the same, a confusion is
caused in the minds of general public or customers that the
outlets run by the appellant or that of the respondent and
thereby their business was affected adversely.  Since prima facie
case is not established, the question of considering the balance of
convenience and irreparable loss does not arise.  It is open for the
respondent/plaintiff to produce sufficient evidence during the
course of trial for establishing his case.
</p><p id="p_18">          For the foregoing reasons, I am of the considered view that
the respondent/plaintiff failed to discharge his burden to prove
the prima facie case that the trade mark DEEPIK2222 used by
the appellant-defendant is deceptively similar to that of the
respondents trademark, causing confusion in the minds of
average customers and that there is no balance of convenience in
favour of the respondent/plaintiff for grant of interim injunction
restraining the appellant from using words 2222.  The
respondent/plaintiff has also failed to make out irreparable
injury that has been caused to it by the use of trade mark 2222
of the appellant.  Therefore, the order passed by the Court below
in I.A.No.147 of 2013 in O.S.No.46 of 2013 dated 25.08.2014 is
set aside to the extent of restraining the appellant from using
words 2222.   However, it is made clear that these observations
are only prima facie findings for deciding this appeal filed against
interlocutory order, as such, same will not be construed as an
expression of this Court. The trial Court may decide the suit on
the basis of evidence adduced by the respondent/plaintiff and
appellant/defendant, without being influenced by the prima facie
findings for deciding this appeal against order in interlocutory
application.
</p><p id="p_19">        Accordingly, the Civil Miscellaneous Appeal is allowed.
There shall be no order as to costs.  As a sequel thereto,
miscellaneous petitions, if any, pending in this CMA, shall stand
disposed of.
