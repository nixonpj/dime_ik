<p id="p_6">                                     9. Having heard the learned Senior
                            Counsel and examined the material on
                            record, we are of the considered view that
                            the High Court ought not to have set aside
                            the order passed by the Trial Court issuing
                            summons to the Respondents. A perusal of
                            the complaint discloses that prima facie,
                            offences        that     are   alleged   against   the
                            Respondents. The correctness or otherwise
                            of the said allegations has to be decided
                            only in the Trial. At the initial stage of
                            issuance of process it is not open to the
                            Courts to stifle the proceedings by entering
                            into the merits of the contentions made on
                            behalf of the accused. Criminal complaints
                            cannot be quashed only on the ground that
                            the allegations made therein appear to be of
                            a civil nature. If the ingredients of the
