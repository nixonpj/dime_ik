State V/s Ram Singh    FIR No. 252/99       PS: Ashok Vihar         Page No. 1/6
 THE BRIEF REASON FOR THE JUDGMENT:-



</pre><p id="p_1">1.   In brief, the case of the prosecution is that on 01/04/1999 at around 09:00
am at road I block towards Satyawati flyover near water tank within the
jurisdiction of Police Station Ashok Vihar, Delhi, accused was found driving a
vehicle bearing registration No. DD 1 PA 3586 on a public way in a rash or
negligent manner so as to endanger human life and safety of others &amp; while
driving the aforesaid vehicle caused the death of Arun Kaul which does not
amount to culpable homicide.
</p>



<p id="p_2">2.   After completion of investigation challan was filed by the police U/s
279/304-A <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_3">IPC</a> of which cognizance was taken by Ld. Predecessor of this
court.
</p><p id="p_3">     Compliance of Sec.207 was carried out and complete set of documents
was supplied to the accused.
</p>



<p id="p_4">3.   Vide order dated 30/07/2001 notice U/s 251 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_4">Cr.P.C</a> was served upon the
accused for trial of offences U/s. 279/304-A <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_5">IPC</a> by Ld. Predecessor to which
accused pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. Thereafter matter was fixed for
prosecution evidence.
</p>



<p id="p_5">4.   In order to prove their case the prosecution has examined 10 witnesses,
testimonies of whom are discussed below:-
</p>

</p>

<p id="p_12">     PW-8 is Dr. L.C. Gupta who proved the P.M. report of the deceased as
Ex. PW-8/A.
</p>

<p id="p_13">State V/s Ram Singh    FIR No. 252/99    PS: Ashok Vihar         Page No. 3/6
      PW-9 is HC Shyam Lal who deposed that on the fateful day he was
posted as In-charge, PCR van and was stationed at water tank, Wazirpur and
was told about the accident by one cyclist. He deposed that he went to the
spot and informed the PCR about that. When IO SI Vikram came, he left the
spot. He was cross examined by Ld. Defence Counsel.
</p>

<p id="p_14">     PW-10 Vimal Vahi is registered owner/superdar of the offending vehicle
bearing No. DL 1 PA 3586 who proved the reply to the notice under <a href="/doc/561735/" id="a_6">Section
133</a> M.V. Act as Ex. PW-10/A, superdarinama as Ex. PW-10/B. The offending
vehicle was exhibited as Ex. P-1.
</p>



<p id="p_15">5.   P.E. was closed vide order dated 19.09.2012 and statement of the
accused U/s. 281/313 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_7">Cr.P.C</a> was recorded to which the accused denied all
the allegations leveled against her but preferred not to lead D.E. Thereafter
the matter was fixed for final arguments.
</p>



<p id="p_16">6.   I have heard the arguments advanced by Ld. APP for the State as well
as Ld. Counsel for the accused and have gone through the evidence and the
material available on record.
</p>



<p id="p_17">7.   The following facts needed to be proved by the prosecution to bring
home the guilt of the accused:-
</p>

<p id="p_18">     a) That the alleged vehicle bearing registration No. DD 1 PA 3586 was


State V/s Ram Singh   FIR No. 252/99        PS: Ashok Vihar     Page No. 4/6
 being driven by the accused at the time of alleged accident.
</p><p id="p_19">      b) That the alleged accident happened due to the said vehicle being
driven by the accused in rash and / or negligent manner.
</p><p id="p_20">      c) That due to the alleged accident, the death of deceased Arun Kaul
occurred.
</p>


<p id="p_21">8.    In the testimonies of either of the witnesses examined by the prosecution
so far none has deposed on the lines that the accident was caused by the
rash and or negligent act of the accused. The prosecution proposed to
examine 12 witnesses which included Raju who was the star/material witness,
on whose complaint the present FIR was lodged. Deposition of the witness Sh.
Raju was necessary in order to prove the charges of rash and negligence on
part of the accused, only he could have proved as to because of whose
negligence the accident occurred. Numerous opportunities were given to
prosecution but it failed to get the said witness examined. His absence has
sounded death knell to the prosecution story.
</p>



<p id="p_22">9.    No other public witness/eye witness finds mention in the list of witnesses
cited by the prosecution who could have deposed anything with respect to the
incident in question or rash and/or negligent act of the accused that the
incident occurred.
</p>



<p id="p_23">10.   What is rash/negligence differs from case to case and in absence of any
direct evidence there cannot be any presumption that the alleged accident was
caused by the accused while driving the offending vehicle in a rash and/or
negligent manner. Unless rash and/or negligent act on the part of the accused

State V/s Ram Singh    FIR No. 252/99    PS: Ashok Vihar           Page No. 5/6
 stands proved, proving of just the accident will not serve any purpose and the
person cannot be convicted U/s 279/304-A <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_8">IPC</a>.         The same was held in
<a href="/doc/317609/" id="a_9">Niranjan Singh V. State (Delhi Administration) (Delhi</a>) 1997 ( I ) R.C.R.
(Criminal) 320.
</p>



<p id="p_24">11. Prosecution is under legal obligation to prove each and every ingredient
of the offence alleged against the accused beyond any reasonable doubt.
Suspicion how so ever strong it may be, cannot replace the standard of proof
required to establish the guilt of the accused.     In the present case, the
prosecution has failed to discharge its onus. The evidence available on record
is not sufficient enough to substantiate the guilt of the accused person.
Accordingly the accused deserves acquittal for offence charge U/s 279/304-A
<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_10">IPC</a>.
</p>



<p id="p_25">12. It is ordered accordingly.
