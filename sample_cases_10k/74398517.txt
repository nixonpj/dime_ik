                           EX-PARTE JUDGMENT
                                19.09.2013

           Vide this Ex-parte judgment, I shall dispose of suit filed by
   plaintiff against defendant for recovery of Rs.7411/-.
           Relevant facts necessary for disposal of the present suit are as
   follows:-

CS No. 97/12                                                          Page No. 1 of 5
        1.</pre><p id="p_1">         In the suit, it is stated that plaintiff is printer and publisher
            of various Magazines/Books of different description and is a
            company incorporated under provisions of <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_1">Companies Act</a>,
            1956. It is stated that Sh. Pradeep Bhatnagar has been
            authorized by plaintiff company vide its Board Resolution to
            represent plaintiff company before Court.
</p>

<p id="p_2">       2.         It is stated that defendant is a Private Limited Company,
            engaged in trading of magazine/ journals/ books/ periodical/
            novels of different publications and defendant has been placing
            orders as per its requirement from time to time on plaintiff
            company which in turn used to supply the same on terms and
            conditions recited in invoice and the same primarily contained
            terms and conditions contemplating mode, manner and time of
            payment.
</p>

<p id="p_3">       3.         It is stated that from invoices as well as statement of
            account of plaintiff, it is reflected that defendant has been
            regularly placing orders on plaintiff complany as per its
            requirements and has been defraying liability arising out of such
            supply of articles effected by plaintiff from time to time and in
            installments. It is stated that equally important is to bear in mind
            the fact that defendant has been receiving articles in terms of


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">CS No. 97/12                                                              Page No. 2 of 5</span>
             order placed by it to its complete satisfaction as there is not
            even an iota of evidence to demonstrate to its contrary.
</p>

<p id="p_4">       4.          It is stated that since plaintiff company was having a long
            standing relationship with defendant, at times, it used to
            accommodate defendant by granting it more time against time
            stipulated in the invoice by agreeing to receive payment in
            installments to help it tide over its financial difficulties. It is stated
            that however, it appears that defendant deliberately misused
            facility provided by plaintiff by refusing to pay its dues even after
            substantial extension of deadline.
</p>

<p id="p_5">       5.          It is stated that despite number of requests, defendant has
            failed to pay outstanding balance amount. It is stated that
            Orders were placed by defendant on plaintiff company in Delhi
            and supply of articles was effected from Delhi, hence cause of
            action to file present suit arose in Delhi.
</p>

<p id="p_6">       6.          Plaintiff has prayed for passing decree for a sum of Rs.
</p><p id="p_7">            7411/- alongwith interest @18% per annum in favour of plaintiff
            and against defendant alongwith costs.
</p>

<p id="p_8">       7.          Defendant chose not to appear even after service of
            summons to him in ordinary manner. Defendant was therefore


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">CS No. 97/12                                                                 Page No. 3 of 5</span>
              proceeded ex-parte on 04.02.2013.
</p>

<p id="p_9">       8.          I have heard arguments addressed by counsel for plaintiff
             and perused the record.
</p>

<p id="p_10">       9.          Plaintiff in ex-parte evidence examined Sh. Pradeep
             Bhatnagar as PW-1. PW-1 has relied upon his affidavit vide Ex.
             PW-1/A, copy of Board Resolution dated 14.11.2011 in his
             favour vide Ex. PW-1 and statement of account qua defendant
             vide Ex. PW-2.
</p>

<p id="p_11">       10.         PW-1 has authority to depose before Court on behalf of
             plaintiff company stands proved in view of copy of board
             resolution dated 14.11.2011 (Ex. PW-1) remaining unrebutted.
             The factum of amount due towards defendant stands proved in
             view of Ex. PW-2 remaining unrebutted.
</p>

<p id="p_12">       11.         Now, let me examine as to whether plaintiff is entitled to
             relief sought in the plaint. As per statement of account of
             defendant filed and proved by plaintiff on record, goods were
             supplied to defendant on 21.01.2009. Perusal of record shows
             that present suit was filed by plaintiff before Court on
             15.03.2012. Plaintiff has not filed and proved any invoice on
             Court record which may show period of credit given to defendant


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">CS No. 97/12                                                         Page No. 4 of 5</span>
              for goods supplied by plaintiff and any document which may
             show date of delivery of goods supplied by plaintiff to defendant
             which means that case of plaintiff for the purpose of limitation is
             governed by <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_2">Article 14</a> of Schedule appended to <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_3">Limitation Act</a>,
             1963 which provides that for price of goods sold and delivered
             where not fixed period of credit is agreed upon, period of
             limitation is three years from date of delivery of goods.
</p>

<p id="p_13">       12.         Date of delivery of goods being not proved on record by
             plaintiff nor anything in this regard being submitted by counsel
             for plaintiff during course of arguments, it is difficult to ascertain
             date of delivery of goods to defendant by plaintiff but by
             reasonable stretch of imagination, it cannot be for about more
             than one month. Present suit has been filed by plaintiff after
             three years and about two months from the date of sale of
             goods meaning thereby that suit of plaintiff is barred by
             limitation. <a href="/doc/880040/" id="a_4">Section 3</a> of Limitation Act provides for dismissal of
             suit which has been filed after prescribed period of limitation.
             Suit of plaintiff is accordingly dismissed. No order as to costs.
