         SUIT FOR DECLARATION, POSSESSION, PERMANENT
                INJUNCTION AND DAMAGES


JUDGMENT
</pre>

<p id="p_1">         This is a suit for declaration and permanent injunction filed by the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                        2</span>

plaintiff against the defendant.
</p>
<p id="p_2">           The plaintiff is stated to be the owner in possession of the suit

property i.e. House No. 9350, Pul Mithai, Tokriwalan, Gali Donewali, Delhi-

</p><p id="p_3">6. The plaintiff lives in the suit property along with his family members

since the year 1936. The defendant is stated to be the licensee of the plaintiff

and is residing in a shed on the roof of the suit property. The suit property is

stated to consist of one room measuring about 10 x10 with 10 x3 open space

in front of the room of the suit property and is made of Kutcha mud as shown

in the site plan. The suit property is stated to be an ancestral property of the

plaintiff which he has inherited from his father. In the year 1926, the parents

of the plaintiff had migrated to India from Pakistan. They had purchased the

said piece of land for consideration and constructed a kutcha mud room over

the said land out of their own personal earnings and since then they had been

living in the suit property. The suit property is stated to be a residential

property of minimum constructed area due to which it is exempted from

payment of property tax. The suit property falls under the slum area. The

plaintiff is stated to have taken birth in the suit property in the year 1936 and

since then he has been living there.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                        3</span><p id="p_4">

</p><p id="p_5">            In the plaint, the plaintiff has referred to several documents which

substantiate the contention of the plaintiff regarding the long time residence

in the suit property. The plaintiff has submitted that in the year 1975, the

defendant was residing in J.J. Colony Khaiberpass, which, during the

emergency, was shifted to Jahangirpuri and the defendant was allotted a plot

of 25 sq. yards in Jahangirpuri. During the shifting of J. J. Colony from

Khaiberpass to Jahangirpuri, the defendant approached the plaintiff for

temporary shelter in the suit property for a short period. The defendant

promised to vacate the suit premises in a short period. Considering the

friendly relation between the parties, the plaintiff allowed the defendant to

take temporary shelter on the roof of the suit property and then the defendant

made a straw shed on the roof of the suit property. The defendant has been

residing along with his family members on the roof of the suit property as a

licensee of the plaintiff.
</p>
<p id="p_6">            On several occasions, the plaintiff has requested the defendant to

vacate the roof of the suit property but the defendant has not vacated the

premises. On 07/08/96, when the plaintiff called the DESU employees for

installation of electricity meter in the suit property, the defendant along with
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                          4</span>

some anti-social elements picked quarrel with the DESU workers and

plaintiff. The defendant also threatened the forceful dispossession of the

plaintiff from the suit property.
</p>
<p id="p_7">             In the plaint, the plaintiff claims to have also attained the right of

lawful ownership over the suit property by long prescription under the law of

adverse possession. Upon the failure of the defendant to vacate the suit

premises on the request of the plaintiff, the plaintiff has filed the present suit

for declaration that he is the lawful owner of the suit property and that the

defendant is unlawfully and unauthorizedly occupying the suit premises.

The plaintiff has also prayed for suitable permanent injunction against the

defendant.
</p>
<p id="p_8">             The defendant was served with summons, in pursuance of which

the defendant filed the written statement and counter claim to the suit of the

plaintiff.   In the written statement the defendant took the preliminary

objection that the plaintiff has not approached this court with clean hands

and he is guilty of suppressio veri and suggestio falsi i.e. the plaintiff has

deliberately and mischievously concealed the relevant and material facts

from this court. On merits, the defendant denied that the plaintiff is the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                       5</span>

owner of the suit property. The defendant submitted that actually the plaintiff

was a tenant in the suit property under the landlordship of the original owner

Smt. Nihalo at a monthly rent of Rs. 14/-, for residential purposes in respect

of one room on the ground floor in the premises bearing municipal no. 9349-

9352, Gali Dorewali, Library Road, Delhi-6, whereas, the said room now

bears municipal no. 9350, Gali Dorewali, Tokriwalan, Delhi-6. Smt. Nihalo

sold the said premises to Smt. Memwati @ Memo through sale deed dated

27/09/68. By operation of law, the plaintiff became a tenant in respect of the

said room under Smt. Memwati. The plaintiff failed to pay the rentals

accrued due to Smt. Memwati. Consequently, on 06/02/76, the landlady

Smt. Memwati instituted the eviction suit against the plaintiff herein on the

ground of non payment of rent after obtaining requisite permission from the

competent authority (Slum) Delhi. The eviction petition was tried by the first

Additional Rent Controller, Delhi and was ultimately decided by judgment

dated 31/08/78. In the said judgment, the Ld. ARC Sh. R.L. Chugh held that

the plaintiff herein was a tenant in respect of the suit premises under Smt.

Memwati at a monthly rent of Rs. 14/- for residential purposes.

Consequently, the plaintiff herein was ordered to deposit the arrears of rent
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                        6</span>

from January-1973 to 31/08/78 within one month from the date of said

judgment. An appeal against this judgment dated 31/08/78 was dismissed by

the Ld. Rent Control Tribunal, Delhi on 02/01/81. In compliance of the said

judgment, the plaintiff herein deposited the arrears of rent and availed of the

benefit provided by Section 14 (2) of <a href="/doc/679372/" id="a_1">Delhi Rent Control Act</a>.

</p><p id="p_9">           Thereafter, the plaintiff herein never claimed himself to be in

adverse possession of the suit property till the date of filing of this suit.

Smt. Memwati sold and conveyed her ownership rights in the suit property to

the defendant herein vide the sale deed dated 02/02/82.          The defendant

claims that upon the execution of sale deed dated 02/02/82, the plaintiff

became a tenant under the defendant by operation of law. The plaintiff did

not pay the arrears of rent to the defendant due to which the defendant sent

the legal notice dated 04/01/94 to the plaintiff. The said notice was

acknowledged by the plaintiff through reply dated 29/01/94 but even in the

said letter, the plaintiff herein never alleged that he was in adverse

possession of the suit premises. The defendant further submits that since the

plaintiff is asserting his ownership rights over the suit property, the plaintiff

has forfeited his tenancy rights therein and is now in illegal use and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                           7</span>

occupation of the suit premises. The defendant specifically denied that the

father of the plaintiff ever purchased the suit property in the year 1926 or at

any point of time.
</p>
<p id="p_10">            In the counter claim, the defendant reiterated the facts mentioned

in the written statement and submitted that the defendant is the owner of the

suit premises, whereas, the plaintiff is in illegal and wrongful occupation of

the suit premises. In the counter claim, the defendant has prayed for relief of

decree of possession of the suit property in favour of defendant and against

the plaintiff herein. The defendant has also prayed for decree of recovery of

Rs. 3500/- against the plaintiff for unauthorized use and occupation/ mesne

profit of the plaintiff in the suit property.
</p>
<p id="p_11">            Upon completion of pleadings, the following issues were framed:-

</p><p id="p_12">           (i)Whether there exists any cause of action in favour of the

              plaintiff and against the defendant for the purpose of present

              suit? OPP.

his case, whereas, the defendant examined only himself as witness in support

of his case.

</p><p id="p_23">           PW1 has been cross examined at length by the counsel for the

defendant. In his cross examination PW1 admitted that he deposited the

arrears of rent in respect of suit property @ Rs. 14/- per month w.e.f.

January-1973 in compliance of the order of Ld. ARC, Sh. R. L. Chugh, dated

31/08/78. PW1 replied that he had told his counsel at the time of drafting the

plaint that he had suffered an order from the court of Ld. ARC, Delhi

directing him to deposit the arrears of rent in the court and that he had

already complied with the said order. He had replied that he had deposited

Rs. 980/- in the court in favour of the landlady Mrs. Memwati @ Memo and

thereafter, he continued to deposit the monthly rent @ Rs. 14/- per month till

the case before Ld. ARC was decided. Upon the question that from whom
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                       11</span>

the suit property was not purchased by his father at any point of time. He

voluntarily replied that his father had only came to live there. In reply to a

question, PW1 replied that he does not know from which date he is claiming

to be in adverse possession of the suit property. PW1 further replied that he

had not understood the contents of the plaint before he signed and verified

the same, and that he signed the plaint without reading and understanding its

contents at the instructions of his counsel. PW1 replied that he did not file

any suit against the defendant for cancellation of the sale deed executed by

Smt. Memwati in favour of defendant. PW1 replied that he never claimed

that he was the owner of the suit property and voluntarily deposed that he

merely said that he was residing there. He replied that he cannot identify the

site plan Ex.PW1/1 as he is illiterate and cannot understand it. PW1 further

replied that he is not the owner of the suit property but is living in the same

by way of adverse possession. He replied that he had no document in his

possession regarding the ownership of the suit property. PW1 finally replied
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                                        12</span>

property is the parental property of the plaintiff but deposed that he does not

know who is the owner of the suit premises.
</p>
<p id="p_26">             In his cross examination, PW3 replied that he has never inspected

the records of the Sub-registrar to ascertain the ownership of the suit

premises.    He replied that he deposed the suit property to be ancestral

property of the plaintiff on the basis that he had seen the parents of the

plaintiff living in suit premises.
</p>
<p id="p_27">             Mr. Shyam Lal deposed as PW4 and filed his affidavit of

the concerned area brought by him, he is not able to locate gali Tokri Walan

but upon seeing the site, the said gali is located in khasra no. 3 and 4. The

ownership of khasra no. 384 is mentioned in the revenue record as (Abadi

Delhi Shahar) and no individual names are given.

<p id="p_31">            Mr. A.S. Singh, UDC, Air Force, Record Office, Suborto Park,

Delhi Cantt., appeared as PW7. But the defendant took objection to his

examination as witness on the ground that his name did not feature in the list

of witnesses filed by the plaintiff.
</p>
<p id="p_32">            PW7 brought the original service book of the plaintiff in which

the plaintiff has been mentioned as the resident of the suit property. He

identified the certificate Ex.PW1/7 as being issued from Air Force Office. In

his cross examination, PW7 replied that it is not mentioned in the record

brought by him as to in what capacity the plaintiff was living in the suit

property. He further replied that in the official record there is nothing to

show that the plaintiff ever claimed to be the owner of the suit property.

</p><p id="p_33">            The defendant examined himself as DW1 and filed his affidavit

of evidence Ex.DW1/A in which he deposed in terms of the written

statement and counter claim. DW1 relied upon the following documents in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">                                       15</span>

support of his testimony:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_10">          (i)the copy of sale deed of the suit property executed by Smt.

             Memwati in favour of the defendant is Ex.DW1/1 (OSR).

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_11">          (ii)The site plan of the suit premises filed by the defendant is

             Ex.DW1/4.</blockquote><p id="p_34">

</p><p id="p_35">           DW1 was cross examined at length by the counsel for the

plaintiff. In his cross examination DW1 replied that he resides on the first

floor and ground floor of the suit property. He replied that he knows the

plaintiff for the last 30 to 40 years and the plaintiff was residing as a tenant

in the suit property. DW1 admitted that the father of the plaintiff was

residing in the suit property. DW1 replied that the suit property belonged to

Smt. Nihalo Devi forty years earlier.        DW1 admitted that he has no

documents regarding the ownership of Smt. Nihalo Devi but voluntarily

deposed that he purchased the suit property from Smt. Memwati, who had, in

turn, purchased the same from Smt. Nihalo Devi. DW1 admitted that in the

written statement, he had not alleged that father of the plaintiff was tenant in

the suit property. DW1 denied the suggestion that the suit property and other

properties in the same locality are vested in the custodian of evacuee
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                                         16</span>

properties.      DW1 finally denied the suggestion that ever since the

construction of the building, the plaintiff is residing there as the owner of the

suit property.
</p>
<p id="p_36">              I have heard the final arguments on behalf of both the parties and

perused the record carefully.
</p>
<p id="p_37">              Now my issue wise findings are as under:-
</p>
<p id="p_38">              ISSUE NO.1: Whether there exists any cause of action in favour

              of the plaintiff and against the defendant for the purpose of

              present suit? OPP.
</p>
<p id="p_39">              The onus of proof of this issue was upon the plaintiff. The term

"cause of action" implies the existence of a specific right vested in the

plaintiff, which has been infringed by the defendant, due to which the

plaintiff has moved the court to vindicate the specific right. The plaintiff has

filed the suit for the relief of declaration that he is the lawful owner of the

suit property, being purchased by the plaintiff's father in the year 1926. The

plaintiff has further sought the relief of declaration that the possession of the

defendant upon the suit property is unlawful, illegal and unauthorized and

the defendant has no right to continue in possession of the suit property. In
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">                                        17</span>

order to seek the declaration of title of ownership, it was incumbent upon the

plaintiff to first prove his ownership over the suit property. As per plaint, the

plaintiff seeks to establish his ownership, firstly through inheritance from

his father on the ground that his father had purchased the same in the year

1926, and alternately, by way of adverse possession through long occupation.

</p><p id="p_40">           Upon sifting of the evidence led by the plaintiff, the conclusion is

inevitable that the plaintiff has failed to establish his ownership through

either mode. The plaintiff has, admittedly, no document of ownership of the

suit property in his possession. Rather, while deposing in his cross

examination as PW1, the plaintiff admitted that the suit property was never

purchased by his father or by him. He deposed that his father had entered the

suit property only to live there, upon the permission of one Mohd. Ishtaf

Bardar. In addition, the plaintiff had replied in his cross examination that he

does not know from which date he is claiming to be in adverse possession of

the suit property. In the plaint too, the plaintiff has not disclosed the specific

date or year from which he is occupying the suit property by way of adverse

possession. As a matter of record, one petition had been filed by Smt.

Memwati against the plaintiff herein in the year 1976, in the court of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">                                       18</span>

Additional Rent Controller, Delhi for eviction of the plaintiff herein. The

said petition had been filed by Smt. Memwati as a landlady of the plaintiff

herein. The said petition was disposed of by Sh. R.L. Chugh, Ld. First

Additional Rent Controller, Delhi, through judgment dated 31/08/78, vide

which the plaintiff herein was held to be a tenant of the petitioner Smt.

Memwati in the suit property at a monthly rent of Rs.14/-. Through the said

judgment, the plaintiff herein was directed to deposit the arrears of the rent

for occupation in the suit property w.e.f. January-1973 till date of said

judgment @ Rs.14/- per month and to vacate the suit premises. The said

judgment also rejected on the ground of adverse possession taken by the

plaintiff herein. The appeal filed by the plaintiff herein against the said

judgment of Ld. Additional Rent Controller, Delhi was also dismissed by

Rent Control Tribunal through appellate judgment dated 02/01/81.

Ultimately, the plaintiff herein deposited the ordered arrears of rent in the

execution proceedings.     The certified copies of both the above said

judgments are available on record.
</p>
<p id="p_41">           The adjudication of the status of the plaintiff herein as a tenant of

Smt. Memwati, and the consequent deposit of arrears of rent by the plaintiff
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">                                        19</span>

herein clearly belies the story put forth by the plaintiff regarding ownership

of suit property by way of adverse possession. The material question before

this court is from which date the possession of the plaintiff over the suit

property became adverse to the claim of the defendant?         The plaintiff has

not helped the court in this regard and has not mentioned any date from

which the plaintiff claims to be in adverse possession of the suit property.

The plaintiff could surely be not in adverse possession of the suit property till

the year 1981 when the appeal filed by the plaintiff herein was dismissed by

the court of RCT, Delhi and the plaintiff had to deposit the arrears of rent for

occupation of suit premises as a tenant. The defendant purchased the suit

property in year 1982 and has claimed that the plaintiff has never proclaimed

himself to be the owner of the suit property till the filing of this suit.

Interestingly, the plaintiff never filed any suit for cancellation of the sale

deed of the suit property, dated 02/02/82, executed by Smt. Memwati in

favour of the defendant.
</p>
<p id="p_42">           The legal position regarding the essentials to be established for

acquisition of title by adverse possession is well settled by a catena of

decisions of the Supreme Court and the High Courts in the country. In
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">                                       20</span>

Karnataka Board of Wakf Vs. Govt. of India &amp; Ors., (2004) 10 SCC 779 it

has been thus observed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court- "it is well settled

principle that a party claiming adverse possession must prove that his

possession is " nec vi, nec clam, nec precario" that is, peaceful, open and

continuous. The possession must be adequate in continuity, in publicity and

in extent to show that their possession is adverse to the true owner. It must

start with a wrongful disposition of the rightful owner and be actual, visible,

exclusive, hostile and continued over the statutory period. Physical fact of

exclusive possession and the animus possidendi to hold as owner in

exclusion to the actual owner are the most important factors that are to be

accounted in cases of this nature. Plea of adverse possession is not a pure

question of law but a blended one of fact and law. Therefore, a person who

claims adverse possession should show: (a) on what date he came into

possession, (b) what was the nature of his possession, (c) whether the factum

of possession was known to the other party, (d) how long his possession has

continued, and (e) his possession was open and undisturbed. A person

pleading adverse possession has no equities in his favour. Since he is trying

to defeat the rights of the true owner, it is for him to clearly plead and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">                                       21</span>

establish all facts necessary to establish his adverse possession."

</p><p id="p_43">           The plaintiff has utterly failed to establish the facts necessary for

proof of the claim of ownership by adverse possession. Plaintiff has even

failed to disclose the date from which his possession became adverse to the

true owner of the suit property. The plaintiff does not admit the defendant to

be the true owner of the suit property.        Then against whose claim of

ownership is the plaintiff trying to set up his own claim of adverse

possession? Moreover, to whom has the plaintiff disclosed his intention to

hold the suit property by way of adverse possession? The plaintiff is

answerless to these questions. Thus, there is no publication of intention of

the plaintiff to hold the property by adverse possession. It is trite law that a

mere occupation of property, howsoever long in duration, does not transform

into an adverse possession unless the possession is hostile to the title of the

real owner. In T. Anjanappa Vs. Somalingappa (2006) 7 SCC 570, it has

been held that for the possession to be hostile the possessor must clearly

know the actual owner of the property. Only then can the situation of being

in hostile possession and question of denying the title of true owner would

arise.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">                                       22</span><p id="p_44">

</p><p id="p_45">             None of the witnesses examined by the plaintiff could prove the

ownership of the plaintiff over the suit property, they are only the witnesses

to the mere long occupation of the plaintiff in the suit property. Thus the

plaintiff has failed to prove, either through documentary or through oral

evidence that he is the owner of the suit property. As a necessary corollary,

the plaintiff is held to have no cause of action to file the suit against the

defendant. The plaintiff is not entitled any declaration sought in the plaint.

Hence issue no.1 is decided against the plaintiff and in favour of the

defendant.
</p>
<p id="p_46">             ISSUE NO.2: Whether the plaintiff is entitled to recovery of

             money as per prayer clause? OPP.
</p>
<p id="p_47">             Issue no.2 is decided in terms of decision upon the issue no.1,

wherein it has been held that the plaintiff has no cause of action to file the

present suit against the defendant, nor is the plaintiff owner of the suit

property. Hence issue no.2 is decided against the plaintiff and in favour of

the defendant. The plaintiff is not entitled to any recovery of money against

the defendant.
</p>
<p id="p_48">             ISSUE NO.3: Whether the suit is not properly valued for court
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">                                        23</span>

           fees and jurisdiction? OPD.
</p>
<p id="p_49">           As per plaint, the plaintiff has valued the present suit at Rs. 200/-

for the purpose of jurisdiction as well as court fees. The law allows the

plaintiff to value the suit for the purpose of court and jurisdiction at his own

wish where the plaintiff has sought the relief of declaration and permanent

injunction and there are no objective standards available to put a specific

value on the relief sought. The defendant led no evidence to prove how the

present suit is under valued by the plaintiff for the purpose of court fees and

jurisdiction. In the absence of any objective standards, the court has no other

option but to accept the value placed by the plaintiff on the suit. Hence, the

issue no.3 is decided in favour of the plaintiff and against the defendant.

</p><p id="p_50">           Relief:
</p>
<p id="p_51">           The plaintiff has failed to prove the facts alleged in the plaint.

Rather, the plaintiff has distorted the material facts in order to stake the claim

of ownership against the defendant. Moreover, the plaintiff did not even

disclose the previous litigations with Smt. Memwati in which the plaintiff

had been held as the tenant in the suit property and had to pay the arrears of

rent from year 1973 to 1978, which renders the plaintiff guilty of suppression
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">                                        24</span>

of material facts. Hence, the suit of the plaintiff is hereby dismissed with

cost of Rs. 2000/- upon the plaintiff. Decree sheet be prepared accordingly.

</p><p id="p_52">           COUNTER CLAIM:-

<p id="p_53">           ISSUE NO.1: Whether there is any cause of action in favour of

           the defendant and against the plaintiff for the purpose of present

           suit? OPD.
</p>
<p id="p_54">           The onus of proof of this issue was upon the defendant. The

defendant has sought the relief of decree of possession and suitable damages

against the plaintiff on the basis of the registered sale deed dated 02/02/82,

which is Ex.DW1/1. Thus the defendant is the registered owner of the suit

property. In the foregoing paragraphs, it has already been observed that the

plaintiff is not the owner of the suit property, rather, the plaintiff had already

been adjudicated as the tenant of Smt. Memwati, who sold the suit property

to the defendant, vide sale deed Ex.DW1/1. Hence, the defendant has the

cause of action to sue the plaintiff. Issue no.1 of the counter claim is

accordingly decided in favour of the defendant and against the plaintiff.

           possession as per prayer clause? OPD.
</p>
<p id="p_56">           As observed earlier in the judgment, the defendant is the owner of

the suit property, whereas, the plaintiff has failed to prove his ownership

over the suit property by way of adverse possession or through any document

of title. Thus, the plaintiff is neither the owner nor the tenant in the suit

property. Then what is the nature of occupation of the plaintiff in the suit

property? The plaintiff can only be a licensee of the defendant in the suit

property. The defendant has sought the relief of decree of possession of the

suit property against the plaintiff. Issue no.2 of counter claim is decided in

favour of the defendant and against the plaintiff. The defendant is held

entitled to the decree of possession of the suit property against the plaintiff.



</p><p id="p_57">           ISSUE NO.3: Whether the counter claim of the defendant is not

           properly valued? OPP.
</p>
<p id="p_58">           The onus of proof of this issue was upon the plaintiff. The

defendant has valued the counter claim at Rs. 28,700/- for the purpose of

jurisdiction and court fees for the relief of possession and recovery of

damages. Apparently, the defendant has properly valued the counter claim
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">                                       26</span>

and no evidence has been led by the plaintiff to prove that the defendant has

not properly valued the counter claim. Hence, issue no.3 of counter claim is

decided in favour of the defendant and against the plaintiff.



</p><p id="p_59">           Relief:
</p>
<p id="p_60">           The counter claim is decided in favour of the defendant and

against the plaintiff.   The plaintiff is directed to hand over vacant and

peaceful possession of the suit premises to the defendant as per the site plan

filed by the defendant, within two months from the date of this judgment.

The plaintiff is also directed to pay the damages for unauthorized occupation

of the suit premises @ Rs. 50/- per month w.e.f. date of filing of the counter

claim till 31/12/2000 and @ Rs. 100/- per month from 01/01/01 till the date

of this judgment. The plaintiff shall pay the damages @ Rs. 500/- per month

from the date of this judgment till the date of handing over of the possession

of the suit property to the defendant. The plaintiff shall pay the interest @
