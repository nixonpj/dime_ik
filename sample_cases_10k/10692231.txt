     THIS APPEAL IS FILED UNDER SECTION 173(1) OF
MV ACT AGAINST THE JUDGMENT AND AWARD DATED
23.08.2011 PASSED IN MVC NO.177/2009 ON THE FILE
OF I ADDL. SENIOR CIVIL JUDGE AND CJM, KOLAR,
PARTLY    ALLOWING    THE  CLAIM  PETITION   FOR
COMPENSATION AND SEEKING ENHANCEMENT OF
COMPENSATION.
                             3




    THIS APPEAL COMING ON FOR ADMISSION,
THIS DAY, THE COURT MADE THE FOLLOWING:


                        JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">     Learned counsel for the claimants/appellants is

correct in his submission that the Motor Accident Claims

Tribunal (for short, MACT) was not justified in deducting

2/4th of the income of the deceased as his personal

expenses   to   award   Rs.2,29,500/-   towards    loss   of

dependency so also learned counsel is correct in his

submission that Rs.10,000/- towards love and affection

and Rs.10,000/- towards funeral expenses is on the

lower side, while Rs.5,000/- towards loss of consortium

for a young widow of the deceased is too frugal.


</p><p id="p_2">     2.    Regard being had to the fact that the deceased

was aged 35 as on 16.06.2009 the date of accident and

death, reckoning Rs.4,500/- as the monthly income of

the deceased, deducting 1/4th towards his personal
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                             4</span>




expenses, since the deceased left behind a young widow,

two minor children and aged parents, all dependants,

and applying multiplier '16' as applicable to the age of

the deceased to the annual loss of income, the appellants

are entitled to Rs.6,48,000/- towards loss of dependency

as against Rs.2,29,500/-. Hence, appellants are entitled

to the balance of Rs.4,18,500/-.
</p>
<p id="p_3">
</p><p id="p_4">     3.    The MACT awarded frugal compensation for

non- pecuniary damages towards love and affection to

the two minor children.    Therefore, an addition sum of

Rs.90,000/- towards loss of care and guidance to the two

minor children is just and proper.    So also, the young

widow left behind by the deceased is entitled to

Rs.95,000/- in addition to Rs.5,000/- towards loss of

consortium.    Yet again, Rs.10,000/- towards funeral

expenses, transportation and obsequies, is on the lower

side, addition of Rs.15,000/- is just and reasonable.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                               5</span>




</p><p id="p_5">     4.    The aforesaid additions are in light of the

decision of the Apex Court in Munna Lal Jain Vs. Vipin

Kumar Sharma reported in (2015) 6 SCC 347.


</p><p id="p_6">     5.    In the aforesaid terms, the appellants are

entitled to Rs.6,18,500/-, in addition to what is awarded

by the MACT.
</p>
<p id="p_7">
</p><p id="p_8">     6.    In the result, the appeal is allowed in part.

The impugned judgment and award dated 23.08.2011 is

modified   entitling   the   appellants   to   Rs.6,18,500/-

(Rupees Six Lakhs Eighteen Thousand and Five Hundred

only) in addition to what is awarded by the MACT and in

all other respects, remains un-altered.
