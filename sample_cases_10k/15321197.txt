               Date of passing the Award          : 04.04.2015

AWARD
       Claimant named above, filed his statement of claim directly before this

Court under <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_1">Section 10-4(A)</a> of the Industrial Disputes Act (hereinafter referred

to as the Act), challenging termination of his service by the management,

named above, on 01.6.2009, from the post of Cargo Assistant.

Case of claimant/workman :

2.     In brief, case of the claimant, as per his statement of claim is that he

joined with the management as Cargo Assistant on 01.7.1993 and the last

drawn monthly wages, drawn by him were @ Rs.5000/-.

       On 08.2.2007, while he was handling/loading a box weighing 1400 kgs,

at the godown of the management, his right foot got injured. Management


LIR/D No. 1142/2011                                                       1 of 12
 assured him of compensation, but ultimately did not pay any amount. It is case

of the claimant that, from time to time, he has been raising demands like

appointment letter, attendance card, payslip, yearly casual leave, overtime,

bonus, leave book etc. but the management did not provide him any such

facility. Ultimately, on 01.6.2009, the management expelled him from service

without making him payment for the month of May 2009, towards overtime,

earned leave, bonus or any amount towards provident fund. He was not served

with any notice or paid any service compensation . As alleged by the claimant,

his services have been termination in violation of <a href="/doc/1056316/" id="a_2">Section 25-F</a> of the Act.

       As regards steps taken by him after termination of his serice, workman

has alleged that he sent demand notice dt. 29.8.2009 to the management, but

the management failed to give any response. Case of claimant is that he is

entitled to reinstatement with continuity in service and full back wages

alongwith all consequential benefits, having remained unemployed ever since

termination of his services.

Version of Management :

3.     In its written statement, management has pleaded that the management

company was incorporated as a private limited company on 10.10.2001,

although it started functioning from July 1996. In this way, management has

denied the claim of claimant that he started working with the management

since 1993.

       Case of the management is that actually the claimant joined the

management in October 1996. He absented from duty w.e.f. 15.4.2010.

LIR/D No. 1142/2011                                                           2 of 12
          Management has denied incident dt. 08.2.2007 while pleading that the

claimant was not detailed for any loading/unloading of goods on that day.

Rather, on that day, during the process of loading by the Loading Party of

Param Cargo Movers, the claimant entered in drunken condition and a packet

weighing 1400 kgs fell on his right leg. He was immediately removed to Indian

Spinal Injury Centre, Vasant Vihar, New Delhi. The entire expenditure to the

tune of Rs.1,55,000/-, for treatment of the claimant, was borne by the

management.

         After the claimant suffered injuries on 08.2.2007, in the manner indicated

above, he remained on leave up to March 2008, i.e. for about a year. Payment

of this period was made to the claimant at his residence. He joined office in

April 2008 and upto 15.4.2009, his services were utilized for light duties. Case

of management is that the claimant was duly paid all his payment and other

expenses upto 15.4.2009 and he acknowledged the same.

         Management has denied to have removed the claimant from service but

pleaded that he started absenting from duty from 15.4.2010 (sic-actually

15.04.2009) without intimation and as such management has not violated any

statutory provisions.

         On the aforesaid pleas, management has prayed for rejection of the

claim.



Points for determination :
4.             From the pleadings of the parties, following issues were framed on


LIR/D No. 1142/2011                                                          3 of 12

</p><p id="p_2">       2. Relief.
</p><p id="p_3">Evidence :
</p><p id="p_4">5.     In order to prove his case, workman has stepped into witness box as

WW1 and tendered in evidence his affidavit Ex.WW1/A and documents

Ex.WW1/1 to WW1/4.
</p>
<p id="p_5">       On the other hand, management has examined MW1 - Shri Kuldeep

Singh - its Director. MW1 has tendered in evidence his affidavit Ex.MW1/A and

documents Ex.MW1/1 to MW1/5.
</p>
<p id="p_6">6.             I have heard learned Authorized Representatives for the parties

and have gone through the record.
</p>
<p id="p_7">Discussion :
</p>
<p id="p_8">Issue No. 1 (Whether the services of the workman have been terminated
illegally and/or unjustifiably by the management?)

</p><p id="p_9">7.     As noticed above, workman has come up with the averments that he got

employed with the management as Cargo Assistant in the year 1993, but

management has denied that he joined in the year 1993. Plea of management

is that he joined in October 1996. Despite opportunity, workman did not file any

rejoinder so as to controvert the plea put forth by the management that he

actually joined in October 1996.
</p>
<p id="p_10">       In his affidavit, the claimant has testified having joined the management

on 01.07.1993 but at the same time further testified that he was so appointed

verbally and no appointment letter was issued to him. Workman, at no point of

LIR/D No. 1142/2011                                                       4 of 12
 time reported the matter to labour office regarding non issuance of appointment

letter to him by the management, although he had joined on 01.07.1993. He

has placed on record Ex. WW1/III i.e. Copy of Identity Card which depicts his

employee code and date of joining as 01.07.1994. There is nothing on record to

suggest that this identity card was not issued by the management or that the

same is a forged and fabricated document. In his cross examination, the

workman was suggested that his identity card was issued in the year 1994 and

the workman admitted this suggestion.
</p>
<p id="p_11">       From the above evidence available on record, it stands proved that the

workman was employed with the management on 01.07.1994 as Cargo

Assistant.
</p>
<p id="p_12">Incident dated 08.02.2007

</p><p id="p_13">8.     As testified by the workman in his affidavit Ex. WW1/A, while performing

duties in the store/godown of the management on 08.02.2007, in the process of

loading and unloading, his right leg got injured and as a result, he is not in the

capacity to do the job he used to perform earlier. He has further testified that

management incurred some medical expenditure but did not provide him

compensation in Workman's <a href="/doc/1113485/" id="a_3">Compensation Act</a>, despite repeated assurances.

Ultimately w.e.f. 01.06.2009 he was refused employment and his earned wages

for the month of May 2009 and overtime wages were withheld. He was also not

paid the contributions made towards PF.
</p>
<p id="p_14">               On the other hand, management has come up with the version that

on 08.02.2007, while loading party of Param Cargo Movers was busy in loading

LIR/D No. 1142/2011                                                         5 of 12
 process, the claimant, while under the influence of liquor, came there and

suffered injury on his right leg due to fall of a parcel weighing 1400 kg.

Management has also pleaded to have removed the workman to Indian Spinal

Injury, Vasant Vihar, Delhi.
</p>
<p id="p_15">9.             It was suggested by the management to the workman (WW1) in

his cross examination that he suffered injury on his right leg on 08.02.2007 due

to his own fault, but the workman denied this suggestion. However, he admitted

that management had taken him to hospital. He admitted to have given in

writing his statement to the Investigating Officer of criminal matter but denied to

have stated therein that he had suffered injuries due to his own negligence.

</p><p id="p_16">               Ex. WW1/M1 is copy of statement of claim given before ASI Ram

Singh of PS Vasant Kunj. When attention of the witness/workman was drawn to

this statement, in his cross examination, he admitted that the same is in his

handwriting.
</p>
<p id="p_17">               It is true that in Ex. WW1/M1 given in writing by the workman to

the police, it stands recorded that on 08.02.2007 at about 6 pm when he was in

the process of loading of a heavy wooden box, with the aid of others in a Tata

407, the wooden box lost balance while he was placing a brick under it. As a

result, the box fell on his right let and he suffered injury. He specifically

mentioned therein that persons from the management immediately removed

him to hospital. Even Sh. Kuldeep Singh, employer of the management also

reached the hospital. In that statement, he did not attribute any negligence or

wrongful act to anyone else. In this manner, he opted not to initiate legal action

LIR/D No. 1142/2011                                                          6 of 12
 against anyone.
</p>
<p id="p_18">10.    The fact remains that the workman suffered injury on his right leg on

08.02.2007 in the course of employment, while serving as Cargo Assistant.

Admittedly, he was got medically treated and medical expenditure was incurred

by the management, although, according to the workman, management

incurred medical expenditure only to some extent.

</p><p id="p_19">               On the other hand, management has come up with the plea that all

medical expenses were borne by it. Workman has not led any evidence to

suggest as to how much he had to incur from his own pocket for his medical

treatment due to aforesaid injury suffered in the course of employment.

Termination/Abandonment:
</p>
<p id="p_20">11.    Workman has testified that management terminated his services w.e.f.

01.06.2009, but management has pleaded that the workman has been

absenting from duties without leave w.e.f. 15.04.2009.

</p><p id="p_21">       It was suggested to the workman (WW1) in his cross examination that he

did not report for duty with the management since 15.04.2009. The workman

denied this suggestion. He further denied to have left for his native village in

Kabirpur and to have returned in May 2009 or to have received balance

towards salary for the month of April/May 2009. He also denied to have left job

with the management. He further denied to have remained on leave from 2007

to May 2009. In the next breath, he admitted that he was at his house for 18

months, for which he was paid salary by the management. But it is not clear in

his statement as to which period of 18 months he referred to.

</p><p id="p_22">LIR/D No. 1142/2011                                                       7 of 12
        Management alleges that he was made all payments and other expenses

upto 15.04.2009. Management has proved on record attendance register

collectively exhibited as Ex. MW1/4. As per this register, which is from April

2006 to May 2009, the workman was on leave w.e.f. 09.02.2007 to 31.03.2008.

From 01.04.2008 his presence stands recorded as per this document. Then in

April 2009, he has been shown to be on leave i.e. from 15.04.2009 onwards.

</p><p id="p_23">       He was not shown absent from that date i.e. 15.04.2009. Had he been

shown absent from 15.04.2009 onwards, then the matter would have been

otherwise. Since he was shown to be on leave from 15.04.2009 onwards, it

was for the management to issue notice to the workman calling upon him either

to report for duties or explain his absence. In his cross examination MW1 has

admitted that he has not placed on record any such letter said to have been

sent to the workman calling upon him to join duties. MW1 further admitted to

have not issued any charge sheet to the workman for his absence.

</p><p id="p_24">12.    On his part, the workman issued demand notice dated 29.08.2009 to the

management. Management has admitted to have received demand notice but

at the same time pleaded to have replied the same. It is so available in the

cross examination of MW1. The reply is dated 12.09.2009. It is significant to

note that in this document, the management nowhere alleged that the workman

had started absenting from 15.04.2009 or that despite letters/reminders he was

not attending his job. Had he been absenting, as pleaded by the management,

this fact must have found specific mention in this reply to the demand notice.

</p><p id="p_25">       From the material available on record, this court finds that workman has

LIR/D No. 1142/2011                                                        8 of 12
 proved that the management terminated his services and management has

failed to prove that it is a case of absenteeism or abandonment of service of the

workman. This issue is decided accordingly in favour of the workman and

against the management.
</p>
<p id="p_26">Relief

</p><p id="p_27">13.      As noticed above, workman got employed with the management on

01.07.1994. He was in continuous service with the management. During

employment when he suffered injury, he proceeded on leave but ultimately

joined in April 2008. Under <a href="/doc/1113485/" id="a_4">Section 25F</a> of the Act, management was required

to comply with the following pre-conditions before terminating his services:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">               No workman employed in any industry who has been in
         continuous service for not less than one year under an employer
         shall be retrenched by that employer until-
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">               a.     the workman has been given one month's notice in
         writing indicating the reasons for retrenchment and the period of
         notice has expired, or the workman has been paid in lieu of such
         notice, wages for the period of the notice
               b.     the workman has been paid, at the time of
         retrenchment, compensation which shall be equivalent to fifteen
         days' average pay (for every completed year of continuous
         service) or any part thereof in excess of six months; and
               c.     notice in the prescribed manner is served on the
         appropriate Government (or such authority as may be specified
         by the appropriate Government by notification in the Official
         Gazette.)
               Herein, it is not case of the management that one month's notice



LIR/D No. 1142/2011                                                          9 of 12
 was issued to the claimant or he was paid in lieu of such notice, wages for the

notice period or that management sought requisite prior permission of the

government.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_28">14.            As a result, this court finds that this is a case where management

has not complied with the conditions precedent as provided u/s 25F of the Act.

So the management terminated the services of the workman in violation of

provisions of <a href="/doc/1113485/" id="a_5">Section 25F</a> of the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_29">               In view of the above findings, this issue is decided in favour of

workman and against the management.
</p>
<p id="p_30">ISSUE No. 2/Relief :
</p>
<p id="p_31">15.            In view of the findings recorded above that the management

terminated services of the workman illegally without complying with the

conditions as laid down in <a href="/doc/1113485/" id="a_6">Section 25F</a> of the Act, this court finds that workman

is entitled to reinstatement in service with continuity in service and other

consequential benefits.
</p>
<p id="p_32">On the point of back wages

</p><p id="p_33">16.            Workman has testified in his affidavit that ever since termination of

his service, he has not been able to get any employment. Learned AR(M) has

referred to the cross examination of the workman wherein he admitted that he

has been running a panwari shop at his house and as such, submitted that

workman is not entitled to any back wages. Management has not led any

evidence to suggest that ever since 01.06.2009 the workman gainfully got

employed anywhere else.
</p>
<p id="p_34">LIR/D No. 1142/2011                                                          10 of 12
                As to what is to be taken into consideration while granting back

wages, in Deepali Gundu Surwase Vs. Kranti Junior Adhyapak

Mahavidyalaya (D.Ed.) &amp; Others CDJ 2013 SC 765, Hon'ble Apex Court has

observed as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">       "The very idea of restoring an employee to the position which he
       held before dismissal or removal or termination of service implies
       that the employee will be put in the same position in which he
       would have been but for the illegal action taken by the employer.
       The injury suffered by a person , who is dismissed or removed or
       is otherwise terminated from service cannot easily be measured
       in terms of money. With the passing of an order which has the
       effect of severing the employer-employee relationship, the latter's
       source of income gets dried up. Not only the employee
       concerned, but his entire family suffers grave adversities. They
       are deprived of the source of sustenance. The children are
       deprived of nutritious food and all opportunities of education and
       advancement in life. At times, the family has to borrow from the
       relatives and other acquaintance to avoid starvation. These
       sufferings continue till the competent adjudicatory forum decides
       on the legality of the action taken by the employer. The
       reinstatement of such an employee, which is preceded by a
       finding of the competent judicial/quasi judicial body or court that
       the action taken by the employer is ultra vires the relevant
       statutory provisions or the principles of natural justice, entitles
       the employee to claim full back wages. If the employer wants to
       deny back wages to the employee or contest his entitlement to
       get consequential benefits, then it is for him/her to specifically
       plead and prove that during the intervening period the employee
       was gainfully employed and was getting the same emoluments.
       The denial of back wages to an employee, who has suffered due
       to an illegal act of the employer would amount to indirectly
       punishing the employee concerned and rewarding the employer
       by relieving him of the obligation to pay back wages including the
       emoluments".

of the well settled law, when management has not been able to lead any cogent
