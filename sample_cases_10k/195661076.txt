1.</pre><p id="p_1">            Workman Sh. Subhash Chander raised an industrial

dispute   against   his   illegal     removal   from   services,   which   was

referred to this court for adjudication  by the Secretary (Labour),



                                 :  1  :                                                            (RC)
 Government   of   National   Capital   Territory   of   Delhi,   in   the

following terms of reference :­




             "Whether Sh. Subhash Chander S/o Sh. Sher Singh,
             Sweeper­cleaner,   B.   No.5447,   has   been   removed
             from   service   illegally   and/or   unjustifiably   by   the
             management   vide order  dated  12.1.96 and  if so,  to
             what   relief   is   he   entitled   and   what   directions   are
             necessary in this respect?"
</p>



<p id="p_2">2.           Brief facts of the case as made out from the record are

that   workman   was   employed   as   appointed   as   sweeper   cleaner

with the management vide letter dated  4.3.83 with badge number

5447   and pay token number 29649.   However, he was served

with a charge­sheet for remaining unauthorizedly absent for one

hundred twenty eight days with effect from 1.4.94 to  30.3.95.  It

is claimed that had to take leave for bonafide reasons of sickness

of   his   children   and   some   family   problem   under   compelling

circumstances   and had submitted  leave  applications  along with

medical   certificate.     However,   it   is   claimed   that   despite


                                :  2  :                                                            (RC)
 explanation   to   the   charge­sheet,   an   inquiry   was   held   by   the

management in violation of principles of natural justice.   In the

inquiry,   he   was   held  guilty  and  was,  thereafter,  removed   from

service.  It is claimed that he was not informed about the inquiry.
</p>
<p id="p_3">It   is   repeatedly   claimed   that   the   inquiry   was   not   conducted

properly and no record was produced in the inquiry.   His leave

was lawful.   In these circumstances, his removal from service is

illegal   and   unjustified.     He   raised   an   industrial   dispute   which

could not be settled and ultimately, came to be referred to this

court   in   the   above   terms   of   reference.       It   is   prayed   that   the

inquiry proceedings as well as removal may be set aside and he

may be directed to be reinstated with all consequential benefits

including continuity of service and full back wages.
</p>



<p id="p_4">3.             Management contested the claim and filed its written

statement   admitting   that   the   workman   was   employed   as

sweeper/cleaner.   However, it is claimed that he was appointed




                                   :  3  :                                                            (RC)
 with   effect   from     23.3.83.     It   is   admitted   that   he   was

unauthorizedly   absent   and   was   charge­sheeted   and     an   inquiry

was conducted against him in which he had full opportunity to

defend   himself   but   was,   ultimately,   found   guilty   and   was,

thereafter, removed from service vide order dated  12.1.96.  It is

claimed   that   the   inquiry   was   conducted   fairly   and   properly   in

accordance   with   principles   of   natural   justice   by   a   competent

officer.     It   is   claimed   that   his   removal   is   lawful   and   justified.
</p>
<p id="p_5">Other allegations contained in the statement of claim have also

been denied and it is prayed that the claim may be dismissed as

the same is false.
</p>



<p id="p_6">4.             Workman   filed   rejoinder   to   the   written   statement,

wherein   he   denied   the   allegations   contained   in   the   written

statement and reasserted the averments made in the statement of

claim.

settled   for   trial   by   my   learned     predecessor   vide   order   dated

23.4.2005 :­



(I)          Whether the domestic enquiry was held in accordance 
             with principles of natural justice?

ISSUE NO. 1:
</p>


<p id="p_15">10.          This issue was disposed of by me vide order dated

12.1.2007 with the following observations :­




          "Arguments on inquiry issue  heard.   File
          perused.  It is submitted by the Ld. AR for
          the   workman   that   neither   any   presenting
          officer was appointed for the management
          nor   workman   was   given   any   defence
          assistant. The workman was not allowed to
          lead   any   evidence.     The   absence   of   the
          workman   was   due   to   sickness.     It   is
          repeatedly   submitted   that   the   inquiry
          conducted against the workman is a farce
          and  sham  inquiry and, as such, it has no
          validity   in the   eyes   of  law   and  the  same
          may be set aside.  
</p>
<p id="p_16">          2.           On the other hand, Ld. AR for
          the   management   submits   that   since   the
          workman   had   himself   admitted   his   fault,
          that is, of remaining absent unauthorizedly
          from   duty    on   account   of   sickness,   there
          was   no     need   either   for   appointing
          presenting officer or defence assistant and
          asking the workman to lead evidence.  It is


                              :  6  :                                                            (RC)
 submitted   by   him   that   the   enquiry   was
conducted   fairly   and   properly   in   which
workman voluntarily admitted the charges.
</p>
<p id="p_17">3.           I   have   carefully   perused   the
inquiry   proceedings     in   the   light   of
evidence   led   on   record.     I   find   that   the
workman   was   charged   vide   charge­sheet
dated 19.5.95 for remaining unauthorizedly
absent for one hundred fifty six days from
April,   1994 to March, 1995.   An inquiry
was  conducted  by Sh. Ram  Mehar  Singh
on     21.8.95   and   when   the   charges   were
explained to him, he voluntarily admitted
that he was absent but his absence was due
to sickness of his three children.   He has
claimed that he had filed applications but
the   same   did   not   reach   the   office.
</p><p id="p_18">Thereafter,   when   the   workman   admitted
his   absence,   there   was   no   need   for
appointing   any   presenting   officer   or
defence  assistant   nor  was   there   any  need
for evidence.   The workman has admitted
in   cross­examination   as   WW1   that   a
domestic   inquiry   was   conducted   against
him into the charges levelled against him
and   that   he   had   participated     in   the
inquiry.    On  account  of his admission  of
absence he was held guilty of the charges
and   was   subsequently   removed   from
service. The workman has not been able to
show as to how he was prejudiced in the
inquiry   and   how   and   in   what   manner
opportunity   was   not   granted   to   defend


                    :  7  :                                                            (RC)
             himself,   more   particularly,   when   he
            himself   admitted   the   charges.     MW1
            Sh.S.K.  Chillar has deposed in the cross­
            examination that   the inquiry proceedings
            on   page   four   wherein   workman   admitted
            his guilt bears his signature.  
</p>
<p id="p_19">            4.             In these circumstances, I do not
            find   that   any  principles  of   natural   justice
            was   violated   or   that   the   workman   has
            suffered   any   prejudice   on   account   of
            violation   of   fair   procedure   by   the
            management.     I,     accordingly,     hold   that
            inquiry   has   been   conducted   fairly   and
            properly in accordance with principles  of
            natural   justice.   The   issue   is   accordingly
            decided in favour of the management and
            against the workman."

workman absented himself from the duties on account of genuine

sickness   of   his   children   and   for   this   he   had   filed   leave

applications with medical record. It is submitted that since   his

children were sick, a lenient view may kindly be taken and some

11A</a> of the Act and observed in paragraphs 8 to 10 as under:­




          "8.         It   is   not   necessary   to   go   into   in
          detail regarding the power exercisable under
          <a href="/doc/1968818/" id="a_3">Section   11A</a>   of   the   Act.   The   power   under
          said   <a href="/doc/1968818/" id="a_4">Section   11A</a>   has   to   be   exercised


                             :  10  :                                                            (RC)
 judiciously and the Industrial Tribunal or the
Labour Court, as the case may be, is expected
to   interfere   with   the   decision   of   a
management under <a href="/doc/31217/" id="a_5">Section 11</a>­<a href="/doc/1656199/" id="a_6">A of the Act</a>
only   when   it   is   satisfied   that   punishment
imposed   by   the   management   is   wholly   and
shockingly disproportionate to the degree of
guilt of the workman concerned. To support
its conclusion the Industrial  Tribunal or the
Labour Court, as the case may be, has to give
reasons in support of its decision. The power
has to be exercised judiciously and mere use
of   the   words   'disproportionate'   or   'grossly
disproportionate'   by   itself   will   not   be
sufficient.

<p id="p_26">9.           In   recent   times,   there   is   an
increasing   evidence   of   this,   perhaps   well­
meant   but   wholly   unsustainable,   tendency
towards   a   denudation   of   the   legitimacy   of
judicial   reasoning   and   process.   The   reliefs
granted   by   the   Courts   must   be   seen   to   be
logical and tenable within the framework of
the law and should not incur and justify the
criticism   that   the   jurisdiction   of   the   Courts
tends to degenerate into misplaced sympathy,
generosity   and   private   benevolence.   It   is
essential   to   maintain   the   integrity   of   legal
reasoning   and   the   legitimacy   of   the
conclusions.   They   must   emanate   logically
from   the   legal   findings   and   the   judicial
results   must   be   seen   to   be   principled   and
supportable   on   those   findings.   Expansive
judicial   mood   of   mistaken   and   misplaced


                   :  11  :                                                            (RC)
            compassion at the expense of the legitimacy
           of   the   process   will   eventually   lead   to
           mutually irreconcilable situations and denude
           the judicial process of its dignity, authority,
           predictability and respectability.

<p id="p_27">           10.           Though   under   <a href="/doc/1522831/" id="a_7">Section   11</a>­A,   the
           Tribunal   has   the   power   to   reduce   the
           quantum   of   punishment   it   has   to   be   done
           within the parameters of law. Possession of
           power   is   itself   not   sufficient;   it   has   to   be
           exercised in accordance with law."

<p id="p_28">15.          Even otherwise unauthorized absence from the duty

for a long period without any reason is a serious misconduct and

furnishes a good ground for termination of service of a workman,

more so when the absence is unduly long and without any reason.
</p>
<p id="p_29">In  this regard   I  am fortified by an authority  reported as  Delhi


Transport Corporation Vs. Sardar Singh, AIR 2004 SC 4161,

wherein Hon'ble Supreme Court dealt with a case of unauthorized

absence of an employee from duty and observed in paragraphs 9

to 11 as under:­




                               :  12  :                                                            (RC)
 "9.            When   an   employee   absents
himself  from  duty, even without  sanctioned
leave   for   very   long   period,   it   prima   facie
shows lack of interest in work. Para 19(h) of
the Standing Order as quoted above relates to
habitual   negligence   of   duties   and   lack   of
interest   in   the   Authority's   work.   When   an
employee absents himself from duty without
sanctioned   leave   the   Authority   can,   on   the
basis   of   the   record,   come   to   a   conclusion
about   the   employee   being   habitually
negligent in duties and an exhibited lack of
interest   in   the   employer's   work.   Ample
material was produced before the Tribunal in
each case to show as to how the concerned
employees   were   remaining   absent   for   long
periods   which   affect   the   work   of   the
employer   and   the   concerned   employee   was
required   at  least   to  bring  some   material   on
record to show as to how his absence was on
the basis of sanctioned leave and as to how
there was no negligence. Habitual absence is
a factor which establishes lack of interest in
work.   There   cannot   be   any   sweeping
generalization.   But   at   the   same   time   some
telltale   features   can   be   noticed   and   pressed
into   service   to   arrive   at   conclusions   in   the
departmental proceedings.
</p>
<p id="p_30">10.        Great   emphasis   was   laid   by
learned counsel for the respondent­employee
on the absence being treated as leave without
pay. As was observed by this Court in State
of Madhya Pradesh V. Harihar Gopal (1969)


                   :  13  :                                                            (RC)
       (3)  SLR 274) by a three­judge Bench of this
      Court,   even   when   an   order   is   passed   for
      treating   absence   as   leave   without   pay   after
      passing an order of termination that is for the
      purpose   of   maintaining   correct   record   of
      service. The charge in that case was, as in the
      present case, absence without obtaining leave
      in advance. The conduct of the employees in
      this   case   is   nothing   but   irresponsible   in
      extreme   and   can   hardly   be   justified.   The
      charge   in   this   case   was   misconduct   by
      absence. In view of the Governing Standing
      Orders unauthorized leave can be treated as
      misconduct.
</p>
<p id="p_31">      11.           Conclusions regarding negligence
      and   lack   of   interest   can   be   arrived   at   by
      looking   into   the   period   of   absence,   more
      particularly,   when   same   is   unauthorized.
      Burden is on the employee who claims that
      there   was   no   negligence   and/or   lack   of
      interest   to   establish   it   by   placing   relevant
      materials.   Clause   (ii)   of   Para   4   of   the
      Standing   Order   shows   the   seriousness
      attached   to   habitual   absence.   In   clause   (i)
      thereof,   there   is   requirement   of   prior
      permission. Only exception made is in case
      of  sudden illness. There also conditions are
      stipulated, non­observance of which renders
      the absence unauthorized".

<p id="p_32">16.     In view of the facts and law referred to above, I find


                         :  14  :                                                            (RC)
 that the act of the workman constitutes serious misconduct and

the punishment imposed upon him is neither disproportionate nor

harsh and it does not call for any interference by the court and, as

such, he is not entitled to any relief.     The issue is accordingly,

decided in favour of the management and against the workman.

copies of the award be sent to the appropriate government.  File

be consigned to record room.
