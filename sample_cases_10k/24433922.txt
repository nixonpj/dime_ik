    ORAL JUDGMENT
    Date: 06-09-2017


                    Heard both the sides.
</p>
<p id="p_345">    2.               The petitioners, herein, seek direction to the respondents to

    regularize the service of the petitioners who were appointed as Sepoy

    Driver on contract basis in accordance with law in the year 2011. It is,

    further, prayed that Memo No. 233, dated 21.04.2012, with respect to the

    additional qualification for appointment on the post of Sepoy Driver shall

    not be applicable to the petitioners and the petitioners be exempted from

    the physical test while regularizing them on the post of Sepoy Driver.
</p>
<p id="p_346">    3.               The brief facts, relevant for deposal of these writ petitions,

    is that the Director General of Police, Bihar, got an advertisement no. 1 of

    2010 published in daily Hindi newspaper "Dainik Jagaran" on 30.08.2010

    for appointment of 610 vacant post of drivers in Bihar Police on

    contractual basis for a period of 11 months. The advertisement prescribes

    the condition, including the essential and eligible qualification, that a

    candidate should be 10th pass besides other conditions that the candidates

    should have driving license of Heavy Motor Vehicle and Light Motor

    Vehicle issued at least prior to the publication of the advertisement. The

    petitioners applied and went through the different test held by the

    Selection Board of the Bihar Police for appointment on the post of Sepoy

    Driver. The results were published on 11.02.2011 and the petitioners

    were appointed on the post of Sepoy Driver in different districts of Bihar

    and petitioners joined their service. After lapse of 11 months the service

    of the petitioners were extended from time to time. The petitioners also

    submitted their applications before the Director General of Police, Home

    Secretary and the Chief Minister for their regularization. Home Police

    Department issued another letter, as contained in Memo No. 1399, dated

    19.03.2014, the Accountant General, Bihar, stating that the Government

    of Bihar in view of Rule 1185A of the Bihar Police Manual created 3031

    posts of Sepoy Driver. The Home Police Department issued another

    notification, as contained in Memo No. 233, dated 21.04.2014, whereby

    Rule 1186 was amended in exercise of power under Section 55 of the
 Patna High Court CWJC No.16505 of 2014 dt.06-09-2017

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                                         16</span>


    Bihar Police Act, 2007, and a proviso was added in Rule 1186(ka) and

    (gha) for regularization. Exemption of five years in the upper age limit

    for appointment on the post of Sepoy Driver, who were working as such

    on contract basis and, on that, amendment was brought about in Rule

    1186 (ka) 2 word "10th pass or equivalent" has been replaced by the word

    "intermediate pass or equivalent". Besides, other amendment brought

    about in the aforesaid Rule 1186 with regard to the upper and lower age

    of a candidate for the post of Sepoy Driver.
</p>
<p id="p_347">    4.               Mr. Bindhyachal Singh, the learned counsel for the

    petitioners, submits that the petitioners have been working till very

    recently on the post of Sepoy Driver on contract basis.        While the

    petitioners were working on contract basis, Home Police Department

    came up with certain amendments in Rule 1186 with regard the minimum

    educational qualification, lower and upper age and experience for

    appointment on the post of Sepoy Driver, but, the vacancies are from

    before the amendment was made in the year 2014.              thereafter, a

    advertisement was published vide advertisement no. 1 of 2016 for

    appointment on the post of Sepoy Driver, therefore, the amended rule can

    not be made retrospective and the petitioners should have been allowed to

    be regularized on the vacant post on which the petitioners were duly

    appointed after due process of appointment. It is, further, submitted that

    the Department of General Administration also issued a notification no.
</p>
<p id="p_348">    97 of 2014, as contained in Resolution No. 9359 and prescribed the

    minimum educational qualification for appointment on the post of Driver

    in different districts of the State of Bihar. The aforesaid notification
 Patna High Court CWJC No.16505 of 2014 dt.06-09-2017

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">                                         17</span>


    prescribes that a person should pass matriculation examination or it's

    equivalent examination. The notification of the Department of General

    Administration framed under the power bestowed under <a href="/doc/1123043/" id="a_1">section 309</a> of

    the Constitution of India shall prevail over the notification and the

    amendment brought about in Rule 1186 and Bihar Police Manual and

    respondents may be directed to allow them to appear in the examination

    in pursuance of advertisement no. 1 of 2016 before relaxing the rules

    enhancing the minimum educational qualification.
</p>
<p id="p_349">    5.               The learned counsel for the petitioners, placed reliance on

    the judgment reported in A.I.R. 1983 S.C., 852 (Y.V. Rangaiah &amp; Ors.
</p>
<p id="p_350">    Vrs. J. Sreenivasa Rao &amp; Ors.), (2010)4 S.C.C., 498 (Maya Mathew

    Vrs. State of Kerala &amp; Ors.) and (2012) XIII S.C.C., 320 (Union of

    India &amp; Ors. Vrs. N.R. Parmar &amp; Ors.).
</p>
<p id="p_351">    6.               On the other hand, the State filed counter affidavit. The

    learned counsel for the State combated the submissions of the learned

    counsel for the petitioners and contended that the advertisement for

    appointment on the post of Sepoy Driver on contract basis was made only

    to arrange for stapler arrangement in contemplation of regular

    appointment. The notification, as contained in Memo No. Annexure 2,

    itself, prescribes different conditions. The minimum age is 18 years and

    the maximum age is 65 years. The notification also prescribes that the

    persons appointed on contract basis shall not be for any purpose treated as

    a regular Government servant and the appointee shall have to enter into

    an agreement before their appointments on the post of Sepoy Driver on
 Patna High Court CWJC No.16505 of 2014 dt.06-09-2017

    contract basis. It is, further, submitted that the appointees on contract

    basis have got no legal right to be regularized.
</p>
<p id="p_352">    7.               The learned counsel for the State, further, submits that the

    Bihar Police Act is also a statutory act and the rule of Bihar Police

    Manual are enacted power bestowed on the authority under Section 55 of

    the Bihar Police Act read with under <a href="/doc/1123043/" id="a_2">Section 309</a> of the Constitution of

    India. <a href="/doc/1158685/" id="a_3">The Police Act</a>s and Rules made there-under deals with regard to

    appointment and service condition of the police Department.
</p>
<p id="p_353">    8.               Having considered the submissions of both the sides, I find

    no force in the submissions of the learned counsel for the petitioners and

    the same is not, at all, acceptable.               Admittedly, the petitioners were

    appointed on contract basis only to meet the exigencies of the Police

    Department. There were different criteria for appointment on contract

    basis. The contract appointees have got no legal right to be regularized

    on the post on which they were working.
</p>
<p id="p_354">    9.               So far as the submission of the learned counsel for the

    petitioners that while the petitioners were working on contract basis, the

    Home Police Department came-up with notification bringing about

    amendments in Rule 1186 of Bihar Police Manual prescribing the

    minimum        educational       qualification      and   other   qualification   for

    appointment on the post of Sepoy Driver, which were lying vacant from

    before and the petitioners were working thereon and this notification can

    not be made retrospective and the clauses of notification are violative of

    Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India. The, further, submissions

    of the learned counsel for the petitioners is that for appointment on the
 Patna High Court CWJC No.16505 of 2014 dt.06-09-2017

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">                                         19</span>


    post of Driver the General Administration Department has already come-
</p>
<p id="p_355">    up with another notification prescribing minimum qualification as

    matriculate pass instead of intermediate pass and, therefore, the

    amendment of Rule 1186 of the Bihar Police Manual is illegal, but, I find

    this submission unfounded and not acceptable.          From perusal of

    Annexure 2, itself, it appears that the Home Police Department was in

    dire need of Sepoy Driver for running the police vehicles and the

    department decided to appoint the same on contract basis till the

    amendment of rule and appointment of Sepoy Driver on regular basis.
</p>
<p id="p_356">    The department appears to have incorporated in the aforesaid

    advertisement that the persons having minimum age of 18 years and

    maximum age of 65 years are eligible for appointment on the post of

    Sepoy Driver on contract basis. But, the department, itself, came-up after

    due deliberation another notification bringing about in different

    amendment in Rule 1186 of the Bihar Police Manual, which prescribes

    the minimum educational qualification and other qualification for

    appointment on the post of Sepoy Driver. This rule was also made under

    the statutory power of Bihar Police Act and it can not be said that the

    notification of Department of General Administration dealing with the

    appointment of driver of different departments of the Government of

    Bihar shall prevail over the notification and the rules made by the Home

    Police Department for appointment on different posts of Police

    Department. Section 55 of the Bihar Police Act gives power to the Police

    Department to frame rule and there-under the authority has brought about

    changes in the Police Manual by amending Rules, which had also got
 Patna High Court CWJC No.16505 of 2014 dt.06-09-2017

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">                                         20</span>


    statutory sanction and, therefore, any notification issued by the

    Department of General Administration can not be said to have over-riding

    effect on the notification and the rules framed under the Bihar Police Act

    and Bihar Police Manual. Both the Departments have got statutory power

    to frame rules for appointment in their department.                 The Police

    Department also has got statutory power to frame rules under the Bihar

    Police Act and Bihar Police Manual has also been framed under the

    statutory power.
</p>
<p id="p_357">    10.              It is also clear that amendment prescribing minimum

    educational and other qualifications for appointment on the post of Sepoy

    Driver was brought about in the year 2014 and the advertisement for

    appointment on the aforesaid post was issued in the year 2016 vide

    advertisement no. 1 of 2016.                After issuance of advertisement for

    appointment on the post of Sepoy Driver, the Department is not legally

    permissible to make any corrections or alteration in the qualification with

    regard to the educational qualification and other qualification of the

    candidates, but, before issuance of any advertisement for appointment the

    Government can alter or amend the rule with regard to eligibility of a

    candidate for appointment on any post to be filled-up in pursuance of any

    advertisement to be issued. In the case of Y.V. Rangaiah &amp; Ors. (A.I.R.
</p>
<p id="p_358">    1983 S.C., 852) (supra), the fact of the case was that Rule 5 of the

    Andhra Pradesh Registration and Subordinate Service Rules was

    amended in the year 1977 dealing with the transfer and promotion to the

    post of Sub-Registrar, Grade II, and it was held that the amendment was

    brought in the year 1977 and, therefore, the promotion with regard to the
 Patna High Court CWJC No.16505 of 2014 dt.06-09-2017

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">                                         21</span>


    vacancy occurring prior to the amendment of 1997 shall be filled-up with

    old Rules. The aforesaid rules deal with the transfer and promotion of the

    persons appointed in the Registration Department not with regard to fresh

    appointment on that post in the case of Maya Mathew (2010)4 S.C.C.,

    498 (supra) which was also with regard to appointment in a cadre from

    different source and the facts of the case is also quite different. In the

    case of Union of India &amp; Ors. (2012) XIII S.C.C., 320 (supra), it relates

    to declaration of seniority of direct recruits vis-à-vis promotees and the

    ratio of the case is also not helpful to the case of the petitioners.
</p>
<p id="p_359">    11.              Thus, on the basis of discussions, made above, I find no

    merit in these writ petitions. Accordingly, the same are dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_360">    12.              However,       if   the    petitioners,   so   desire,   may   file

    representations before the Department to consider their case for

    regularization in accordance with law.
