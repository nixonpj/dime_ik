JUDGMENT:
</pre><p id="p_1">		      J U D G M E N T
S.B. Majumdar.J,
     M/s Northern  Plastics Ltd.  is the common appellant in
these two  appeals moved by it after obtaining special leave
to appeal  from this  Court against a common judgement dated
9th March  1990 passed	by the	High Court  of Delhi  in two
Civil Writ Petitions, one moved by M/s Hindustan Photo Films
Mfg.Co.Ltd. ('HPF'  for short),	 respondent no.1 in C.A. No.
2035 of	 1990, and  the other the Union of India, respondent
no.1 in	 the companion	Civil Appal  No. 2036  of 1990.	 The
question companion  Civil  Appeal  No.	2036  of  1990.	 The
question posed	for our	 consideration is  as to whether 1st
respondents in	these Civil writ appeals could be said to be
'persons aggrieved'  within the	 meaning of <a href="/doc/769438/" id="a_1">Section 129-A</a> of
the Customs Act, 1962 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act')
so that	 they could challenge before the customs, Excise and
Gold (Control)	Appellate Tribunal  ('CEGAT' for  short) the
order passed  by the Additional Collector of Customs, Bombay
dated 5th  June 1989  agreeing with  the notings made by the
Assistant  Collector   of  Customs   dated  31st   May	1989
recommending release  of the  imported goods  to the  common
appellant on  payment of  full customs	duty. The CEGAT took
the view  the respondent  no.1 in  both these appeals had no
locus standi  to prefer	 appeals against the said order. The
High Court  of Delhi  by the  impugned judgment	 has taken a
contrary view and has ruled in favour of the locus standi of
these respective respondents.
</p><p id="p_2">     Before we	deal with  the aforesaid question it will be
necessary to  not the  relevant background  facts leading to
the present  controversy between  the parties. The project a
chequered history.  The common	appellant, Northern Plastics
Ltd.,  which   will  hereinafter  be  referred	to  as	'the
appellant' for	the sake  of convenience,  is said  to	have
obtained   Small    Scale   Industries	 Registration	(SSI
Registration)  on   24th  August   1985	 for   slitting	 and
confectioning of  jumbo rolls of various types of films. The
said registration,  according to the appellant, was obtained
under The  Industries (Development  &amp; <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_2">Regulation)  Act</a>, 1951
('IDR Act'  for short).	 A notification	 was issued  by	 the
competent authority  under the	said Act  on 18th  July 1986
effectively taking  away the  exemption fro   requirement of
licence in  respect of	Item 20	  of 1st Schedule to the IDR
Act thus  making  it  obligatory  for  owner  of  industrial
undertaking to	have licence  within six  months. It  is the
case of	 the appellant that although it was not the owner of
industrial undertaking	as defined  by the  IDR Act, under a
mistaken belief	 it applied  for COB licence on 8th December
1986. On  7th July  1988 a  notification was  issued by	 the
Central Government  in exercise	 of its	 powers	 under	sub-
section (i)  of <a href="/doc/1033713/" id="a_3">Section	 25</a> of the Act exempting jumbo rolls
of graphic  art films and jumbo rolls of photographic colour
paper, of  width 1 meter or more and of length 600 meters or
more, falling within Chapter 37 of the First Schedule to the
<a href="/doc/442204/" id="a_4">Customs Tariff	Act</a>, 1975  (51 of  1975), when imported into
India, from  so much  of that portion of the duty of customs
leviable thereon  under the  said First	 Schedule as  was in
excess of  the amount  calculated at the rate of 60 per cent
ad valorem, subject to the following conditions:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">     (i)  the importer	undertakes conversion  of  the	said
	  jumbo	 rolls	 by  slitting	confectioning	into
	  finished products;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">     (ii) the importer holds an industrial licence under the
	  Industries (Development  and <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_5">Regulation) Act</a>, 1951
	  (65 of  1951), for  slitting and  confectioning of
	  photo-sensitised materials from jumbo rolls.
</blockquote><p id="p_3">According  to	the  appellant	 the  benefit  of  the	this
concession in  import duty  on the  jumbo rolls	 of  various
types of  films which  were being  imported by the appellant
was available  to it.  The appellant  had  imported  various
consignments of	 articles of  X-Ray films  and	graphic	 art
films through  the port	 at Bombay  between January 1989 and
May 1989.  The shipments concerned for the same consignments
were  made  in	favour	of  the	 appellant  by	the  foreign
exporters between  15th December  1988 and  20th April 1989.
According to the appellant the goods were worth Rs. 246 lacs
approximately in  foreign exchange.  That the  appellant had
paid customs  duty  amounting  to  Rs.	196  lacs  on  these
consiqnments and  the additional  duty if  the exemption was
not available  to the  appellant on these consignments would
have become  payable to the extent of Rs. 130 lac. The total
value of  the goods imported at Bombay port by the appellant
during	the  aforesaid	period	worked	up  to	Rs.572	lacs
according to  the  appellant.  The  Assistant  Collector  of
Customs (Bombay)  had not  granted the	requisite relief  of
concessional  import   duty   payable	for   the   imported
consignments of	 the appellant.	 Hence a writ petition being
Civil Writ  Petition No.  2021 of  1988	 was  moved  by	 the
appellant in  the High Court of Delhi where principal relief
sough was  for the grant of benefit of the aforesaid customs
exemption notification.	 A prayer was also made for issuance
of COB	licence by  the competent  authorities under the IDR
Act. Initially	the appellant  had not joined M/s. 'HPF',  a
public sector  undertaking in  the said	 writ petition	as a
respondent  as	it  was	 merely	 a  business  rival  of	 the
appellant. However  on an  application by the HPF a Division
Bench of  the High  Court by  its order	 dated 8th  May 1989
allowed it  to be  a  party-respondent	in  the	 appellant's
petition. In  the  aforesaid  writ  petition  filed  by	 the
appellant before  High Court of Delhi initially an order was
passed by  a learned  Single  Judge  directing	removal	 and
release of  the jumbo  rolls imported  by the  appellant  at
Bombay at  concessional rate  of customs  duty. However this
interim order  set aside  by a	Division Bench	of the	High
Court by  its order  dated 8th	May 1989.  Pending this writ
petition on the Delhi High Court, upon an application by the
appellant, an  order  was  proposed  to	 be  passed  by	 the
Assistant Collector  of Customs	 (Bombay) on  31st May	1989
permitting the	clearance of the imported consignment of the
appellant upon	payment of  full rate  of customs  duty. The
said proposed  order was  placed  for  approval	 before	 the
Additional Collector  of Customs  (Bombay). Below  the	said
proposal the  Additional Collector  of Customs	(Bombay) put
his endorsement	 agreeing to  the said	proposal on 1st June
1989. The  said order  which came  to be communicated to the
appellant on  5th June	1989 entitled the appellant to clear
the imported  goods on	payment of full customs duty without
availing of  the benefits of the concessional rate of import
duty pursuant to the earlier referred notification dated 7th
July 1988.
</p><p id="p_4">     Having come  to know  about the order of the Additional
Collector  of	Customs,  HPF	which  is  a  public  sector
undertaking wholly  owned by  Government of India, which was
already joined	as a  party, at	 its  own  request,  to	 the
appellant's  pending,  petition,  moved	 an  interim  relief
application in	that petition  for staying the clearance and
removal of  the goods  imported by  the appellant.  The High
Court by  its order  dated 9th June 1989 in vacation granted
ex-parte stay  of the  Collector's order. The interim relief
application of	HPF was	 subsequently heard another Vacation
Judge in  the  High  Court  on	21st  June  1989  and  after
completion of  the arguments  on behalf	 of the	 HPF on 26th
June 1989  a  request  was  made  for  not  pronouncing	 the
judgment in the said interim relief application. However the
said  request	was  not  granted  and	the  interim  relief
application of	HPF was	 dismissed on  26th June 1989 by the
high Court. That thereafter HPF filed a writ petition in the
High Court  of Bombay  on that	very day, that is, 26th June
1989 praying  for similar  interim relief against release of
the imported goods to the appellant. The High Court rejected
the request  for exparte  interim relief.  A  Special  Leave
Petition was also moved by the HPF before this Court against
the Delhi High Court order dated 26th June 1989 vacating the
exparte stay  granted against the releases of imported goods
in favour  of the appellant. The said Special Leave Petition
was dismissed  as  withdrawn  by  this	Court.	After  HPF's
Special Leave  Petition was  dismissed as  withdrawn by this
Court on  27th June  1989 a writ appeal was moved by the HPF
before a Division Bench of the Bombay High Court against the
order of  learned Single  Judge refusing  to grant  ex parte
stay in	 writ petition	of HPF,	 but no	 interim relief	 was
granted by  the High  Court even  in this writ appeal. Under
these circumstances  HPF filed	an appeal  to CEGAT  on 28th
June 1989  against the	order  of  Additional  Collector  of
Customs (Bombay)  dated 5th  June 1989.	 An exparte  interim
order was  obtained from  CEGAT for  a week  up to  6th July
1989. HPF  then withdrew the writ petition before the Bombay
High Court.  In the meantime the status quo order granted by
CEGAT expired  on 6th July 1989 and it was not extended. HPF
then filed  a writ  petition before  the High Court of Delhi
being Writ  Petition No.1932 of 1989 against the order dated
7.7.1989 passed	 by CEGAT and the Division Bench of the High
Court passed an ex parte stay of the order of the Additional
Collector of  Customs dated 5th June 1989 on 12th July 1989.
The High  Court of  Delhi by  its order dated 17th July 1989
disposed of  Writ Petition No. 1932 of 1989 moved by the HPF
against the  Additional Collector's order and directed CEGAT
to dispose  of the  appeal  of	the  HPF.  The	High  Court,
however, further  directed that	 till the  final disposal of
the appeal  by the  CEGAT the stay granted on 12th July 1989
would continue.	 Before HPF's  appeal could  be heard by the
CEGAT an  appeal being	No. 2072  of 1989  was filed  by the
Ministry of Industries, New Delhi before CEGAT under <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_6">Section
129-A</a> of  the Act  against the very same order of Additional
Collector dated 5th June 1989. A Bench of CEGAT by its order
dated 31st  July 1989  dismissed the  appeal of	 HPF against
Collector of Customs on the ground that HPF being a business
rival  of  the	appellant  was	not  'person  aggrieved'  as
contemplated by	 <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_7">Section 129-A</a>	of the	Act  and  hence	 the
appeal was  not maintainable.  Thereafter on 8th August 1989
the other appeal filed by Ministry of Industries against the
very same  order of Additional Collector of Customs was also
dismissed as  not maintainable,	 the Ministry  of Industries
being held  not an  'aggrieved person' within the meaning of
<a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_8">Section 129-A</a>  of the  Act. Under  these  circumstances	 HPF
filed another  Writ Petition  No. 2286	of 1989 in the Delhi
High Court  on 9th  August 1989	 challenging two orders- (i)
the order  of CEGAT  dated 31st July 1989 holding its appeal
as not	maintainable;  and  (ii)  the  order  of  Additional
Collector  of  Customs	(Bombay)  ordering  release  of	 the
imported goods	to the	appellant. A  Division Bench  of the
High Court  while admitting  the  writ	petition  restrained
clearance of  the goods	 in favour  of the appellant pending
the writ  petition. In	the said  writ petition	 Ministry of
Industries was	also permitted	on  its	 application  to  be
impleaded  as	party-respondent.   The	  Union	  of   India
representing  Ministry	of  Industries	in  its	 turn  filed
another write petition being Civil Writ Petition No. 3023 of
1989 on	 24th October  1989 before  the High  Court of Delhi
against the  order dated  8th August  1989 passed  by  CEGAT
against it.  That petition  was also  admitted by  the	High
Court  of  Delhi.  Both	 these	writ  petitions	 were  heard
together and  by a  common order  dated	 9th  March  1990  a
Division Bench	of the	High Court  took the  view that	 the
appeals filed  by the respective first respondents i n these
appeals were  maintainable before the GEGAT as they could be
said to be 'persons aggrieved' within the meaning of <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_9">Section
129-A</a> of  the Act  and that they had sufficient locus standi
in public  interest to maintain their appeals. In the result
the Division Bench of the High Court partly allowed the writ
Petition of  both the  first respondents  in  these  appeals
moved by  the Union  of India  as well as HPF and passed the
following order:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">     "We have  held that  the  Union  of
     India  and	  M/s.	Hindustan  Photo
     Films Ltd.	 are 'aggrieved	 person'
     and can  maintain an  appeal  under
     <a href="/doc/769438/" id="a_10">Section 129-A</a>  of the  Customs Act.
     The  main	 question  in  the  writ
     petition at  the root of the entire
     controversy between  the parties is
     whether the said importation of the
     photo-sensitized material at Bombay
     was  legal	 or  not  would	 now  be
     decided by	 the Appellate Tribunal.
     But  assuming  that  M/s.	Northern
     Plastics  Ltd.   takes  an	  appeal
     against our  order to  the	 Supreme
     Court and our decision is reversed,
     still the	question of the legality
     of the importation would be open to
     the parties  to be	 argued in  this
     writ petition before us. Thus, till
     the main  question of  legality  of
     importation is finally disposed of,
     in the  interests of justice, it is
     necessary that  the subject-matter,
     of	 the   controversy,   viz.   the
     imported goods,  are  preserved  in
     the   custody    of   the	 Customs
     Authorities and  are not  released.
     Since  the	 goods	are  now  stored
     under the	suitable  conditions  of
     storage with M/s. Northern Plastics
     Ltd.  there  is  no  likelihood  of
     their deteriorating.  No  variation
     in our order dated 9.8.89 in regard
     to	 the   release	of   goods   is,
     therefore, called for.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">	  The writ  petition  is  partly
     allowed  to  the  extent  indicated
     above."
</blockquote><p id="p_5">As already  noted the aforesaid common order of the Division
Bench of the High Court of Delhi has resulted in present two
appeals on  grant of  special leave  by this  Court. Pending
these appeals  it was  felt by	this Court that the imported
goods in question were likely to deteriorate with passage of
time and  if the happened the contesting parties would stand
to suffer irretrievably. Consequently by an order dated 25th
April 1990  a Bench  of two learned Judges of this Court was
pleased to  direct that	 Chief	Controller  of	Imports	 and
Exports may  be appointed as Court Receiver for disposing of
the goods in question by sale in auction as expeditiously as
possible and  at the  maximum price  they will	fetch in the
market. It  was further directed that the amount of the sale
proceeds of  the auction shall forthwith be deposited by the
receiver in  this court	 to the	 credit	 of  these  appeals.
Accordingly the	 goods were  auctioned. By  a further  order
dated 21st  September 1990  another  Bench  of	two  learned
Judges of  this Court  accepted the offer of four purchasers
who had	 offered to  purchase all  the disputed	 goods for a
total sum  of Rs.  1,40,00,000/-.  Four	 action	 sales	were
confirmed in  favour of the concerned auction purchasers. By
the same order it was directed that the auction amount shall
be deposited  by this  Court in	 a Fixed Deposit Account and
the amount  so deposited  shall remain in the custody of the
Court and  shall be disposed of in accordance with the final
judgment in  the appeals  pending before the Customs, Excise
and Gold  (Control) Appellate  Tribunal. The aforesaid order
was passed  for the  obvious reason  that by that time under
the common  judgment under  appeal CEGAT was directed by the
High Court  to dispose	of the	appeals of Union of India as
well as	 HPF pursuant  to its  judgment.  However  as  these
appeals are  being disposed  of finally by us by the present
judgment appropriate  order will  have to be passed by us in
connection with	 this deposited amount. We shall do so after
considering  the   main	 question  involved  in	 controversy
between the parties in these appeals.
</p><p id="p_6">     For the  purpose of  these appeals we shall assume that
the order  of Assistant	 Collector of  Customs (Bombay),  as
approved by the Additional Collector of Customs (Bombay), of
1st June  1989 was  in	itself	appealable  to	CEGAT  under
<a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_11">Section 129-A</a>  of the  Act being a decision and order passed
by an  adjudicating authority  under <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_12">Section 122</a> of the Act.
We assume as aforesaid for the simple reason that Shri Dave,
learned senior	counsel for  the  appellant  has  vehemently
contended  that	 the  said  endorsement	 of  the  Additional
Collector of Customs was of an administrative nature and was
not appealable.	 Neither CEGAT	nor the	 High Court of Delhi
has considered	that question  and as that question strictly
does not  arise for our consideration in the present appeals
for deciding  the controversy  between the  parties we	have
assumed as aforesaid.
</p><p id="p_7">Rival Contentions
     Shri Dave, learned senior counsel for the appellant has
vehemently contended  that the	Division Bench	of the	High
Court had  patently erred in taking the view in the impugned
common judgment	 that HPF  as well as Industries Ministry of
the Union  of  India  were  'aggrieved	person'	 within	 the
meaning of <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_13">Section 129-A</a> of the Act. According to Shri Dave,
the only parties which could prefer appeal to CEGAT could be
either the  aggrieved importer	or the	Collector of Customs
after following	 the procedure	of <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_14">Section 129-D</a> of the Act.
That save  and except these two parties no third party had a
right to  appeal under	the Act.  That right of appeal under
the appeal  under the  Act. That  right of appeals under the
Act is	a creature of statute. Therefore, we have to look at
the relevant  provisions of  the  statute  with	 a  view  of
finding out  whether an	 appeal lies  at the instance of any
third parties  like the	 present first	respondents in	both
these appeals.	Shri Dave  in this  connection placed strong
reliance on  <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_15">Section 129-A</a>  sub-section (1)  as well as sub-
section (3)  thereof. In support of his submission he placed
reliance on  judgment of  this Court to which we will make a
reference at  an appropriate stage. Shri Dave submitted that
the concept of locus standi as expanded be decisions of this
Court in  connection with  public interest litigations moved
before this  Court under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_16">Article 32</a> or before the High Court
under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_17">Article  226</a> of  the  Constitution  of  India  had  no
application to	the statutory  right of	 appeal to be culled
out for	 the express  language of  the statute	creating the
appellate forum	 and also  confirming the right of appeal to
the parties  mentioned therein. In the alternative submitted
Shri Dave,  neither the	 Industries Ministry  nor  the	HPF,
which is  a rival  commercial concern,	can be	said  to  be
aggrieved by the order of the Assistant Collector of Customs
(Bombay) directing  release of	the imported goods in favour
of the	appellant on payment of full customs duty. Shri Dave
also tried  to submit  that it	could not  be urged  by	 the
contesting respondents	that the  import  of  the  goods  in
question was  unauthorised as  for additional import licence
purchased  by	the  appellant	actual	user  test  was	 not
applicable. For	 resolving the	present controvesy it is not
necessary to  consider this  alternative contention  of Shri
Dave. We  will confine	our decision to the limited question
whether appeals	 moved by  each of  the first respondents in
these appeals before CEGAT were maintainable or not.
</p><p id="p_8">     Learned counsel  Shri Subba Rao appearing for the Union
of India as well as learned counsel appearing for HPF on the
other hand  tried to  support the  decision rendered  by the
High Court  of Delhi  and  submitted  that  on	the  express
language of  <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_18">Section 129-A</a>  sub-section (1)  of the  Act the
Industries Ministry  of the  Union of  India as	 well as HPF
could be  said to  be 'persons aggrieved'. That according to
the Industries	Ministry of Union of India the appellant had
imported goods	which were  liable to confiscation under the
Act and, therefore, the order of the Additional Collector of
Customs (Bombay)  was patently	erroneous. That	 it affected
the public  revenue as	well as the effective implementation
of IDR	Act and,  therefore, it	 could not  be said that the
Industries Ministry  did  not  represent  sufficient  public
interest  to  maintain	the  appeal  before  CEGAT.  Learned
counsel for  HPF in  his turn  submitted that  HPF which  is
wholly owned  Government company  where more  than  Rs.	 400
crores are sunk by Central Government from public coffers is
a limb	of the	Union of  India itself	and when  such large
extent of public funds are involved in the working of HPF it
cannot be  said that  it did not represent sufficient public
interest  to  maintain	the  appeal  against  the  order  of
Additional Collector  of Customs  by which  huge quantity of
illegally imported  goods were	sought	to  be	released  in
favour of the appellant. That such goods, if permitted to be
imported, would	 result in  flooding the  local	 market	 and
would severely	prejudice the  working of  HPF	which  is  a
public concern	that has  now gone  sick and  hence the High
Court had  committed no	 error in  holding that	 the HPF had
sufficient locus standi to maintain its appeal before CEGAT.
</p><p id="p_9">     In the  light of these rival contentions we now proceed
to consider the question posed for our decision.
</p><p id="p_10">     At the  outset it must be kept in view that appeal is a
creature of statute. The right to appeal has to be exercised
by persons  permitted  by  the	statute	 to  prefer  appeals
subject to  the conditions  regarding  the  filing  of	such
appeals. We  may in  this connection  usefully	refer  to  a
decision of  four learned judge of this Court in the case of
The Anant  Mills Co.  Ltd. etc.	 etc. v.  State of Gujarat &amp;
others etc.  etc. [AIR	1975 SC 1234 = (1975) 2 SCC 175]. In
that case Khanna, J., speaking for the Court had to consider
the question  whether the  provision of	 statutory appeal as
per Section  406(2)(e) of  the Bombay  Provincial  Municipal
Corporation  Act,  1949	 which	required  the  appellant  to
deposit the  disputed amount  of tax  before appeal could be
entertained could  be said  to be  in any  way violative  of
<a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_19">Article 14</a>  of the  Constitution  of  India.  Repelling	 the
aforesaid challenge  to the  vires of the said provision the
following pertinent observations were made in para 40 of the
Report :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_5">     "...The  right  of	 appeal	 is  the
     creature of  a statute.  Without  a
     statutory provision creating such a
     right the	person aggrieved  is not
     entitled to file an appeal. We fall
     to	 under	 stand	as  to	why  the
     Legislature  while	  granting   the
     right  of	 appeal	 cannot	  impose
     conditions for the exercise of such
     right.  In	  the  absence	 of  any
     special reasons there appears to be
     no	   legal    or	  constitutional
     impediment	 to  the  imposition  of
     such conditions. It is permissible,
     for   example,   to   prescribe   a
     condition in  criminal  cases  that
     unless  a	 convicted   person   is
     released on bail, he must surrender
     to	 custody   on  bail,   he   must
     surrender	to  custody  before  his
     appeal  against   the  sentence  of
     imprisonment would	 be entertained.
     Likewise,	it   is	 permissible  to
     enact a  law that	no appeal  shall
     lie against an order relating to an
     assessment of  tax unless	the  tax
     had been paid. Such a provision was
     on the  statute book  in <a href="/doc/454306/" id="a_20">Section 30</a>
     of the Indian Income-tax Act, 1922.
     The proviso to the section provided
     that '..........no appeal shall lie
     against an	 order under sub-section
     (1) of  <a href="/doc/848541/" id="a_21">Section 46</a>	 unless the  tax
     had  been	paid'.	Such  conditions
     merely regulate the exercise of the
     right of appeal so that the same is
     not  abused   difficulty	in   the
     enforcement of  the order	appealed
     against  in   case	 the  appeal  is
     ultimately dismissed. It is open to
     the  Legislature	to   impose   an
     accompanying liability upon a party
     upon whom	legal right is conferred
     or to  prescribe conditions for the
     exercise	of    the   right.   Any
     requirement for  discharge of  that
     liability or the fulfilment of that
     condition	 in   case   the   party
     concerned seeks  to  avail	 of  the
     said right	 is  a	valid  piece  of
     legislation, and  we can discern no
     contravention of  <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_22">Article 14</a>  in it
     ........."</blockquote>
<p id="p_11">     It has  also be  noted that  the wider concept of locus
standi in public interest litigation moved before this Court
under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_23">Article  32</a> of  the Constitution of India which itself
is a  fundamental right	 or under  <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_24">Article 226</a>	before	High
Courts which  also offers  a constitutional remedy cannot be
imported  for	deciding  the  right  of  appeal  under	 the
statutory provisions  contained in  the <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_25">Customs Act</a>. Whether
any right  of appeal  is conferred  on	anyone	against	 the
orders passed  under the Act in the hierarchy of proceedings
before the  authorities has  to be judged from the statutory
settings of  the Act  and not before them. Therefore, in our
view, the  High Court in the impugned judgment had erred  in
drawing the  analogy from  the more elastic concept of locus
standi under  <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_26">Article 32</a> of Article evolved by this Court by
its decisions  on the  subject. It is also to be appreciated
that  the   decision  of   this	 Court	in  <a href="/doc/1553344/" id="a_27">Bar	 Council  of
Maharashtra v. M.V. Dabholkar</a> etc. etc. AIR 1975 SC 2092 was
based on an entirely different statutory scheme. For judging
the competence and locus standi of the Union of India or the
HPF for	 moving appeals	 before CEGAT  against the  order of
Additional Collector  of Customs passed under <a href="/doc/746655/" id="a_28">Section 122</a> of
the Act	 the answer  must be  found  from  within  the	four
corners of the Act itself.
</p><p id="p_12">     We have,  therefore, to  turn to  the <a href="/doc/1652403/" id="a_29">Scheme of the Act</a>
providing for  appeals. Provision  of appeals  is  found  in
Chapter XV  of the  Act. <a href="/doc/911167/" id="a_30">Section  128</a> deals with 'Appeals to
Collector (Appeals)' and <a href="/doc/152074697/" id="a_31">Section 128-A</a> deals with 'Procedure
in appeal'.  The Appellate  Tribunal is	 constituted as	 per
<a href="/doc/543615/" id="a_32">Section 129</a>  of the  Act. Sub-section  (1) thereof lays down
that, 'the  Central Government shall constitute an Appellate
Tribunal to be called the Customs, Excise and Gold (Control)
Appellate  Tribunal  consisting	 of  as	 many  judicial	 and
technical members  as it  thinks fit  to exercise the powers
and discharge  the  functions  conferred  on  the  Appellate
Tribunal by  this Act'.	 It is,	 therefore, obvious that the
Appellate Tribunal  CEGAT  is  a  creature  of	statute	 and
derives its  jurisdiction and  powers only  from the statute
creating it  and not  outside the same. Then follows <a href="/doc/769438/" id="a_33">Section
129-A</a> dealing  with 'Appeals to the Appellate Tribunal'. The
relevant provisions thereof read us under :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_6">     "129-A.   Appeals to the Appellate

     into force,  preferred  after  such
     commencement   to	 the   Appellate
     Tribunal."
</p><p id="p_20">The aforesaid  provisions of the Act leave no room for doubt
that  they   represent	a   complete  scheme   or  code	 for
challenging the	 orders passed by the Collector (Customs) in
exercise of  his statutory  powers. It is axiomatic that the
importer against  whom the collector has passed the impugned
order of  adjudication and  who is  called upon	 to pay	 the
customs duty  which, according	to him,	 is not	 payable  an
appeal	under  <a href="/doc/1728895/" id="a_50">Section	129-A(1)</a>  of  the  Act.	 So  far  as
departmental authorities  themselves are concerned including
the Collector  of Customs  no  direct  right  of  appeal  is
conferred on  Collector to  prefer appeal  against  his	 own
order  before	the  CEGAT.   However  there  is  sufficient
safeguard made	available to  the Revenue  by  the  Act	 for
placing in  challenge erroneous	 orders of  adjudication  as
passed by  the Collector  of Customs  by moving	 the Central
Board of  Excise and  Customs under  <a href="/doc/139581596/" id="a_51">Section 129-D(1)</a>  for a
direction to  the  Collector  to  apply	 to  the  CEGAT	 for
determination of  such point  arising out of the decision or
order as  may be  specified by	the Board of Revenue in this
connection. Similarly  a statutory remedy is provided to the
Collector of  Customs  in  connection  with  orders  of	 the
Appellate Collector of Customs passed immediately before the
appointed day  and also in connection with the orders passed
by Collector  of Customs  under	 <a href="/doc/152074697/" id="a_52">Section  128-A</a>,  to  direct
proper officer	to appeal  on his  behalf as  laid  down  by
<a href="/doc/177848193/" id="a_53">Section 129-DA(1)</a> as well as on the Central Government under
contingencies contemplated  by <a href="/doc/177848193/" id="a_54">Section	129-DA(1)</a>. These are
the only  statutory modes  contemplated by the Act by resort
to which  the orders of Collector (Customs) could be brought
in challenge  before higher  statutory authorities including
the CEGAT. In the light of this statutory scheme, therefore,
it is  not possible  to agree with the contention of learned
counsel for  the contesting respondents that sub-section (1)
of <a href="/doc/769438/" id="a_55">Section  129-A</a> entitles  any	 and  every  person  feeling
aggrieved by  the decision  or order  of  the  Collector  of
Customs as  an adjudicating  authority, to  prefer statutory
appeal	to  the	 Appellate  Tribunal.  Neither	the  Central
Government, through  Industries Department,  nor  the  rival
company or  industry operating	in the	same  field  as	 the
importer can  as a  matter or  right  prefer  an  appeal  as
'person	 aggrieved'   is  wider	  than	the   phrase  'party
aggrieved'. But	 in the	 entire	 context  of  the  statutory
scheme especially sub-section (3) of <a href="/doc/769438/" id="a_56">Section 129-A</a> it has to
be held	 that only the parties to the proceedings before the
adjudicating authority	Collector of  Customs  could  prefer
such an	 appeal to  the CEGAT and the adjudicating authority
under S.122  can prefer such an appeal only when directed by
the Board  under <a href="/doc/139581596/" id="a_57">Section  129-D(1)</a> and	not otherwise. It is
easy  to   visualise  that   even  a  third  party  may	 get
legitimately aggrieved	by the	order of  the  Collector  of
Customs being  the adjudicating authority if it is contended
by such	 a  third  party  that	the  goods  imported  really
belonged to  it and not to the purported importer or that he
had financed  the same	and, therefore,	 in substance he was
interested in  the goods  and consequently the release order
in favour  of the  purported importer  was prone to create a
legal injury  to such  a third	party which  is not actually
arraigned as  a party  before the adjudicating authority and
was not	 heard by  it. Under such circumstances such a third
party might  perhaps be	 treated to  be legally aggrieved by
the order  of the  Collector of	 Customs as  an adjudicating
authority and may legitimately prefer an appeal to the CEGAT
as  a  'person	aggrieved'.  That  is  the  reason  why	 the
Legislature in	its wisdom  has used  the phrase 'any person
aggrieved'  by	 the  order   of  Collector  of	 Customs  as
adjudicating authority	in <a href="/doc/1728895/" id="a_58">Section 129-A(1)</a>. But it order to
earn a	locus standi  as 'person  aggrieved' other  than the
arraigned party	 before	 the  Collector	 of  Customs  as  an
adjudicating authority	it must	 be shown that such a person
aggrieved being	 third party  has a direct legal interest in
the goods involved in the adjudication process. It cannot be
a general public interest or interest of a business rival as
is being  projected by the contesting respondents before us.
In this	 connection we	may refer  to a	  Constitution Bench
judgment of  this Court in the case of <a href="/doc/1537030/" id="a_59">Adi Pherozshah Gandhi
v. H.M.	 Seervai, Advocate  General of	Maharashtra,  Bombay</a>
[(1970 (2)  SCC 484]. Question before the Constitution Bench
in that	 case was as to whether Advocate General of the High
Court  who  was	 be  to	 issued	 a  notice  in	disciplinary
proceedings by	the Bar	 Council as  per the  provisions  of
Section 35(2)  of the Advocate Act, 1961 had locus standi to
prefer an  appeal against  the	order  of  the	disciplinary
authority under	 <a href="/doc/256237/" id="a_60">Section 37</a>  of the Advocates Act before Bar
Council of  India. A majority of the Constitution Bench took
the view that the Advocate General had no such locus standi.
He could  not be  said to  be a	 'person aggrieved'  by	 the
decision  of  the  disciplinary	 authority  exonerating	 the
concerned delinquent  advocate. Mitter, J., speaking for the
majority  considered  the  question  in	 the  light  of	 the
statutory settings  of the  Act and  observed that to decide
the question  one had  to look	at the	proceedings of	this
kind. We  may refer  to the  pertinent observations  in this
connection made	 in paras 9 and 10 of the Report of the said
judgment of Mitter, J.:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_16">     "Generally speaking.  a person  can
     be said to be aggrieved by an order
     which   is	   to	his   detriment.
     pecuniary or  otherwise  or  causes
     him some  prejudice in some form or
     other. A  person who is not a party
     to a  litigation has  no  right  to
     appeal merely  because the judgment
     or	 order	 contains  some	 adverse
     remarks against  him.  But	 it  has
     been held in a number of cases that
     a person  who is  not a  party to a
     suit may  prefer an appeal with the
     leave of  the appellate  court  and
     such leave	 would	not  be	 refused
     where the judgment would be binding
     on	 him   under  Explanation  6  to
     Section 11	 of the	 Code  of  civil
     procedure. We find ourselves unable
     to take  the view	that  because  a
     person has	 been  given  notice  of
     some  proceedings	 wherein  he  is
     given a  right to	appear and  make
     his submissions,  he should without
     more have a right of appeal from an
     order rejecting  his contentions or
     submission. An appeal is a creature
     of	 statute   and	if   a	 statute
     expressly gives a person a right to
     appeal, the matter rests there.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_17">     Innumerable   statutes    both   in
     England and in India give the right
     of appeal	to 'a  person aggrieved'
     by an order made and the provisions
     of	 such	statutes  have	to    be
     construed in  each case to find out
     whether  the  person  prefering  an
     appeal    falls	 within	    that
     expression.  As   was  observed  in
     Robinson v	 Currey [7  QBD 465] the
     words   'person	aggrieved'   are
     'ordinary meaning	put upon  them'.
     According	to  Halsbury's	Laws  of
     England  (Third  Edition,	Vol.25),
     page 293, footnote 'h':
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_18">	  'the	expression   is	 nowhere
     defined and  must	be  contrued  by
     reference to  the	context	 of  the
     enactment in  which it  appears and
     all the circumstances.'
     Attempts have  however from time to
     time  been	  made	to   define  the
     expression in  various cases. In Ex
     parte Sidebotham  In re  Sidebotham
     [14  Ch   D  458  at  465]	 it  was
     observed by James.L.J.:
	  'But	 the	words	 'person
     aggrieved' do not really mean a man
     who is  disappointed of  a	 benefit
     which he  might  have  received  if
     some other	 order had  been made. A
     'person aggrieved'	 must be  a  man
     who has suffered a legal grievance,
     a man  against whom  a decision has
     been    pronounced	    which    has
     wrongfully	   deprived    him    of
     something,	 or  wrongfully	 refused
     him   something,	 or   wrongfully
     affected his title to something."</blockquote>
<p id="p_21">A Bench	 of four learned Judges of this Court in the case of
<a href="/doc/1749406/" id="a_61">Jasbhai Motibhai Desai v. Roshan Kumar Haji Bashir Ahmed and
others</a> [(1976)	1 SCC  671] had	 to examine  the  scheme  of
Bombay Cinemas Regulation Act 1953 and a rule therein with a
view of	 finding out  whether a	 rival	cinema	owner  could
appeal against	a No  objection	 Certificate  grated  to  an
applicant who  wanted to  establish a  cinema theatre of his
own. Sarkaria,	J., speaking  for the  Court  observed	that
under the  relevant provisions	of the	Regulations no right
was conferred  by way  of special  interest on	such a rival
cinema owner  as he  did not  satisfy the  test	 of  'person
aggrieved'. Nor	 could he  be treated to be a valid objector
being resident of the locality or person to whom any special
right of  objection was	 conferred by  the statutory scheme.
Thus he was merely a rival cinema owner who was likely to be
adversely affected  in his  commercial interest	 if  another
cinema theatre	got established	 and came  to be  run in the
light of the No objection Certificate. That such an interest
was considered to be too remote to clothe the objectors with
a right	 to object  to the No Objection Certificate to run a
cinema under  the Rules.  Paras 47  and 48  of the Report in
this connection deserve to be noted:
</p><p id="p_22">     "Thus,    in     substance,     the
     appellant's  stand	  is  that   the
     setting up	 of a rival cinema house
     in the  town will	adversely affect
     his     monopolistic     commercial
     interest,	causing	 pecuniary  harm
     and   loss	   of	business    from
     competition. Such	harm or	 loss is
     not wrongful  in the  eye	of  law,
     because  it   does	 not  result  in
     injury  to	  a  legal  right  or  a
     legally  protected	  interest,  the
     business  competition   causing  it
     being    a	    lawful     activity.
</p><p id="p_23">     Juridically,    harm     of    this
     description is  called damnum  sine
     injuria,  the  term  injuria  being
     here used	in its	true sence of an
     act contrary  to  law  [Salmond  on
     Jurisprudence,   12th    Edn.    by
     Fitzgerald, p.357,	 para  85].  The
     reason why the law suffers a person
     knowingly to  inflict harm	 of this
     description  on   another,	 without
     holding him  accountable for it, is
     that   such   harm	  done	 to   an
     individual is  a gain to society at
     large.
</p><p id="p_24">     In	  the	light	to   the   above
     discussion,  it   is   demonstrably
     clear that	 the appellant	has  not
     been denied  or deprived of a legal
     right. He	has not sustained injury
     to any  legally protected interest.
</p><p id="p_25">     In fact,  the impugned  order  does
     not operate  as a decisions against
     him, much	less does  it wrongfully
     affect his	 title to  something. He
     has suffered no legal grievance. He
     has no  legal peg for a justiciable
     claim to  hang on.	 Therefore he is
     not a 'person aggrieved' and has no
     locus standi to challenge the grant
     of the no-objection certificate."
</p><p id="p_26">Shri Subba Rao, learned counsel for Union of India contended
that the  Central Government through the Industries Ministry
had interest  in the  litigation in question as large public
revenue was  involved and  the protection to be conferred on
the local  manufactures and  those dealing  in local markets
had  to	  be  guarded  against	the  onslaught	of  mushroom
importers. That	 this  public  interest	 was  sought  to  be
vindicated by  the Union  of India  by raising	the  present
dispute. If the concerned import was found to be illegal the
goods would  be liable	to confiscation. That when more than
Rs.400 crores were sunk by the Union of India in its company
HPF it could not be said that the Union of India through the
Ministry of Industries was a total stranger and had no locus
standi whatsoever  to challenge	 the order of the Additional
Collector of  Customs. So  far as  the	Union  of  India  is
concerned we  may proceed  on the  basis that it may have to
subserve a  larger public  interest by	raising the  present
dispute and  may legitimately feel aggrieved by the order of
the Additional	Collector of  Customs. But even if it is so,
the statutory  procedure laid  down by the Parliament in its
wisdom for  enabling the challenge to the adjudication order
of the	Collector of Customs by way of appeals or revisions,
to which  we have  made a mention, has got to be followed in
such an	 eventuality. Bypassing the said statutory procedure
a direct  frog leap  to CEGAT  is  contra-indicated  by	 the
statutory scheme  of the  Act. If  such direct	appeals	 are
permitted the  very scheme  of <a href="/doc/139581596/" id="a_62">Section	129-D(1)</a>  would	 get
stultified. It	must, therefore,  be held that direct appeal
filed by  the Union  of India through Industries Ministry to
CEGAT under <a href="/doc/1728895/" id="a_63">Section 129-A(1)</a> was clearly incompetent. It may
by added  that the  Union of  India could have used the mode
set out in <a href="/doc/88669098/" id="a_64">section 129D</a>, but it did not do so.
</p><p id="p_27">     So far  as the  appeal filed  by HPF is concerned it is
still on  a weaker  footing. Even though HPF may be a public
limited company	 wholly owned  by the Central Government and
even if	 Central Government might have sunk more than Rs.400
crores in  constituting it,  its function would still remain
in the	domain of commercial enterprise. It may be a limb of
the Central Government or its alter ego so far as <a href="/doc/134715/" id="a_65">Article 13</a>
of the	Constituting is	 concerned and may be treated end to
answer	challenges   about   violation	 of   constitutional
guarantees or  statutory provisions  under which  it may  be
acting, but  that would	 not clothe  it with  a legal  locus
standi to  prefer a  statutory	appeal	before	CEGAT  under
<a href="/doc/1728895/" id="a_66">Section 129-A(1)</a>.  From the  point of view of that provision
it is no more than a business rival and cannot be said to be
a 'person  aggrieved'  by  the	adjudicatory  order  of	 the
Collector  of	Customs	 releasing  imported  goods  to	 the
appellant on payment of full customs duty. It has also to be
noted that  the <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_67">Customs Act</a> nowhere provides for any special
interest of  such public  concerns which may be operating as
rivals in  the same  commercial field  in which the importer
may be	operating. In  the absence  of any special statutory
provision for  protecting the  interest of  such  Government
concerns or  public sector  undertakings no  statutory locus
standi can  be called  out in  their favour  on the  express
language of  the relevant  provisions of the Act noted by us
earlier. It  must, therefore,  be held	that HPF  was a mere
business rival	operating in  the same	commercial field and
carrying on the same commercial activities as the appellant.
Its locus  standi  to  challenge  the  order  of  Additional
Collector of  Customs in favour of the appellant, therefore.
gets squarely ruled out by the ratio of the decision of this
court in the case of Jasbhai Motibhai Desai (supra). Learned
counsel for  the HPF   in  this connection submitted that if
imported goods	of the	appellant were	allowed to enter the
market	HPF's	commercial  interest   would  be  materially
prejudiced and	by now	it has	already become	a sick unit.
That is	 neither here  nor there.  The said  grievance would
still be  in the  realm of damnum since injuria as indicated
in Jasbhai  Motibhai Desai's  case (supra)  by	this  Court.
Consequently the  appeal filed	by HPF before the CEGAT also
must be	 treated to  be incompetent and could not be covered
by the sweep of <a href="/doc/1728895/" id="a_68">Section 129-A(1)</a> of the Act.
</p><p id="p_28">     Learned counsel  for HPF  invited our  attention  to  a
decision of  a two-member Bench of this court in the case of
<a href="/doc/1583107/" id="a_69">K.Ramadas Shenoy  v.  The  Chief  Officers</a>.  Town  Municipal
Council. Udipi	and others [(1975 (1) SCR 690]. In that case
a resident in a locality wherein a cinema building was being
constructed contrary to be binding Town Planning Scheme, was
held to	 be entitled  to challenge  the said  building. Said
decision is  rendered on its own facts. The statutory Scheme
was for	 the benefit  of persons  residing in  the locality.
Under the  said Scheme	the  Municipal	authorities  owed  a
public duty and obligation under the statute to see that the
residential   area    is   not	 spoiled   by	unauthorised
construction. Under these circumstances it was held that the
aggrieved party	 had sufficient	 locus standi  under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_70">Article
226</a> of	the Constitution  of India  of move  the High  Court
against	 the  violation	 of  the  statutory  scheme  by	 the
municipal authorities.	It is easy to visualise that in that
case this  Court was  concerned with  the locus standi of an
'aggrieved party'  under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_71">Article  226</a> of the Constitution of
India which  is	 of  a	wider  nature  as  compared  to	 the
statutory right	 of appeal  under a  given statutory  scheme
before a  statutory authority  created by that very statute.
The said decision is, therefore, of no avail to HPF.
</p><p id="p_29">     As a result of the aforesaid discussion it must be held
that the  High Court  had committed a patent error of law in
taking the  view that  the concerned writ petitioners before
it had	sufficient locus  standi to  prefer  appeals  before
CEGAT. The  decision of	 CEGAT holding that they had no such
locus standi  was perfectly  justified on  the scheme of the
Act and	 it  was  wrongly  set	aside  by  the	High  Court.
Consequently the appeals will be required to be allowed.
</p><p id="p_30">     However   a   further   question	survives   for	 our
consideration. As  the High  Court has noted in the impugned
judgment, the  other contentions in the writ petitions filed
by the	contesting respondents	were not considered by it in
view of	 its decision  on the right of appeal which was made
available to  the  concerned  writ  petitioners	 before	 the
CEGAT. We  have, however, to observe in this connection that
the High Court was not at all justified in presuming what it
should do  in case  the appellant's  appeal succeeded before
the Court.  Proper direction  in that connection should have
been left  to be given by this Court in such an eventuality.
High Court  could not  have been  pre-empted the same by the
impugned judgment.  However in	view of	 the fact that other
contention in  the writ	 petitions were	 not examined by the
High Court  in any case they will now have to be examined by
it. As	the decision  on the  right to	appeal to CEGAT made
available to the contesting respondents by the High Court is
being set  aside by  us, the  question remains	as  to	what
further appropriate  orders can be passed in the connection.
So far	as this	 question is  concerned it may be noted that
tow writ  petitions were  moved, one by Union of India being
Civil Writ  Petition No.  3023 of  1989 and  another by	 HPF
being Civil  Writ Petition No.2286 of 1989. As we have taken
the view  that HPF  being a  business rival of the appellant
had  no right to challenge the order of Additional Collector
of Customs,  Bombay passed  in favour  of the  appellant its
writ petition  being Civil  Writ Petition  No.2286  of	1989
filed before  the High	Court will  stand dismissed. However
writ Petition  No.3023 of  1989 will have to be permitted to
proceed further	 on remaining  controversy before  the	High
Court in  so far  as Union  of India  seeks of challenge the
order of  Collector of	Customs, Bombay	 dated 1st/5th	June
1989. As  we have  taken the  view that Union of India could
legitimately challenge	the said  order	 before	 appropriate
forum in public interest and as it has wider locus standi at
least in  proceedings under  <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_72">Article 226</a> of the Constitution
of India  if not  before CEGAT,	 its challenge	in the	writ
petition under	<a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_73">Article 226</a> against the said order cannot be
told off  the gates. That challenge will have to be examined
by the High Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_74">Article 226</a> on its own merits. It is
obvious that  it will  be open to be appellant as contesting
respondents to	try to	support the  impugned order  of	 the
Assistant Collector/Collector  of  Customs  on	all  legally
permissible grounds.  In short	the said controversy between
the Union  of India on the one hand and the appellant on the
other in Union of India's Writ Petition No.3023 of 1989 will
have to	 be examined by the Division Bench of the High Court
on its own merits. AS the proceedings are pending since long
before the  High Court	so far as the aforesaid challenge is
concerned it  would be in the interest of justice to request
the High  Court to  decide the	said writ  petition  on	 the
merits of  the question regarding the legality and propriety
of the	order of  Collector/Assistant Collector	 of  Customs
dated 5th  June 1989 as expeditiously as possible preferably
within a period of four months from the date of receipt of a
copy of this order at its end.
</p><p id="p_31">     Now remains  the last question as to what is to be done
about the amount fetched in auction of the goods pursuant to
the interim  order of  this Court dated 24th September 1990.
We cannot  accede to  the request to the learned counsel for
the appellant  that the	 said invested	amount with  accrued
interest may  be permitted  to be withdrawn by the appellant
at this	 stage by  furnishing bank guarantee. In our view as
the amount  is lying  deposited and  invested by  this Court
since more  than six  and half	years by  now and  as we are
requesting  the	 High  Court  to  decide  the  pending	writ
petition of  Union of  India on	 the surviving	question  as
aforesaid within  four months  from the	 date of  receipt of
copy of the present order it would be in the interest of all
concerned to continue the investment of the deposited amount
of the	auction price  by this	Court and to direct that the
withdrawal of that amount shall abide by the final result of
the writ  petition of  the Union  of India  before the	High
Court and shall also remain subject to the result of further
appeal, if  any, against  the High  Court's judgment  in the
said writ petition.
</p><p id="p_32">     The  appeals   are	 accordingly   allowed.	 The  common
judgment under	appeal as  rendered by	the  High  Court  is
quashed and  set aside with a direction to the High Court to
decide on  merits the Union of India's Writ Petition No.3023
of 1989	 on the	 remaining  grounds  in	 the  light  of	 the
observations made  in this  judgment. There will be no order
as to costs in the facts and circumstances of these cases.
