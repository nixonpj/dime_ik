State of Haryana and another                                  ...Respondents

CORAM: HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE AMOL RATTAN SINGH

Present :     Mr. Sant Lal Barwala, Advocate
              for the petitioner.

              Mr. Puneet Jindal, Sr. Advocate with
              Mr. Hitesh Pandit, Advocate and
              Mr. Amandeep Singh, Advocate
              for the respondents.

        ****
AMOL RATTAN SINGH, J. (Oral)
</pre>
<p id="p_1">              By this petition the petitioner seeks quashing of the condition

in the advertisement (Annexure P-5), by which the score in the 'GATE

examination 2017' alone has been fixed as the criteria of selection for

appointment of Assistant Engineers in the Civil and Electrical cadres of the

Haryana Power Utilities. (GATE is stated to be the acronym for the

Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering).
</p>
<p id="p_2">2.            On the date that notice was issued, learned counsel for the

petitioner had pointed out that even as per the certificate issued to a

candidate who has passed the GATE examination, the score obtained in any

particular examination is valid for a period of three years and therefore, the

petitioner having appeared in the said examination in the year 2016, even




                                       1 of 7

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2"> CWP No.20605 of 2017 (O&amp;M)                                                   -2-</span>

as per the certificate/score card issued to him, i.e. Annexure P-2, the score

is valid upto 22.03.2019, as stated on the certificate itself.

</p><p id="p_3">3.            Notice having been issued, it prima facie appearing to this

Court that the certificate having been issued by the Ministry of Human

Resources Development (MHRD), the respondent power utilities have

erred in fixing the criteria restricted to the GATE examination score of the

year 2017, a reply has now been filed on behalf of both the respondents.

</p><p id="p_4">4.            Learned Senior counsel appearing for the respondents submits,

on query, that the rationale for adopting the aforesaid criteria is that the

written examination that was a part of the selection process earlier, was

naturally conducted separately for each selection process advertised by the

Power Utilities of Haryana, and the marks obtained in a particular written

test of a particular selection process, alone were to count as the criteria for

selection for the posts advertised.
</p>
<p id="p_5">              That being so, it was decided as a matter of policy that instead

of conducting its own examination, the power utility concerned would

adopt a "universal criteria" of accepting the GATE score, the said

examination being one conducted by 5 IITs (Indian Institutes of

Technology), in rotation, each year.
</p>
<p id="p_6">              Hence,    thought    the      GATE   examination    replaced   the

examination to be conducted by the power utility concerned, as a selection

criteria for appointment to the posts in question, the examination result of

only the last examination conducted prior to the selection process, was

decided to be kept as the sole criteria for such selection.

</p><p id="p_8">5.            Learned Senior Counsel further submits that as a matter of fact

the period of 3 years given on the certificate (score card) issued to each

candidate as had appeared in the GATE, is for the purpose of obtaining

admissions in centrally funded universities in the country, for post graduate

and doctoral programmes/degrees.
</p>
<p id="p_9">              Hence, the same criteria cannot be mandatorily applied to all

selection processes also, by different selection bodies as have decided (as a

matter of choice), to adopt the last GATE examination conducted as the

criteria for selection to the posts advertised.
</p>
<p id="p_10">              He still further submits that even an amendment has been made

in the rules governing recruitment, i.e. the Punjab State Electricity Board

Service of Engineering (Electrical) Regulations, 1965 (as applicable to the

HVPNL), inasmuch as Regulation 10 thereof now provides the GATE

examination conducted by one of the Indian Institutes of Technology every

year, to be the sole criterion for filing up the posts advertised by the said

corporation, i.e. the HVPNL.
</p>
<p id="p_11">6.            Mr. Puneet Jindal, Sr. Advocate submits that in fact even an

"advance public notice" was issued on 01.07.2016 by the respondents, a

copy which has been annexed with the petition itself as Annexure P-3,

wherein clause 4 (iii) specifically states that the score of GATE 2016, or

any previous GATE examination, would not be valid for the recruitment

process in question and it would only be the GATE score of 2017 that

would be considered valid.
</p>
<p id="p_12">              The same condition was incorporated in the advertisement




                                       3 of 7

issued one year later on 28.07.2017, which is the advertisement in question.

</p><p id="p_13">7.            Mr. Sant Lal Barwala, learned counsel for the petitioner, on the

other hand firstly reiterates that the Ministry of Human Resource

Development itself having made the score obtained in the GATE

examination valid for 3 years, there is no reason for any organization to

depart from that mandate and secondly, even as regards the amendment in

the regulations aforesaid, it has not been specified that only the GATE

examination conducted in the year of the recruitment process, or the last

one before the recruitment process, would be taken as the criterion, with the

amended rule also simply stating as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">              Regulation-10 "Appointment by Direct Recruitment"
              (Electrical)
              "(i) The vacant posts of Assistant Engineer (Electrical) meant
              for direct recruitment in the Nigam would be filled up on the
              basis of score of GATE (Graduate Aptitude Test in
              Engineering) examination being conducted by one of the
              Indian Institutes of Technology every year subject to
              fulfillment of conditions as laid down in Regulation-8 of PSEB
              Service of Engineering (Electrical) Regulation, 1965 and
              amended from time to time."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">              (ii) The above provision will be applicable w.e.f. 01.07.2016.
                Note:        The recruitment already being undertaken by
                HVPNL (for all HPUs) through M/s PGCIL will continued
                to be got done through M/s PGCIL.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_14">8.            Having considered the aforesaid arguments, though there may

otherwise have been something to what learned counsel for the petitioner is

stating as regards the amendment made in the rules, however, specifically




                                       4 of 7
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                    ::: Downloaded on - 09-12-2017 00:13:35 :::</span>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8"> CWP No.20605 of 2017 (O&amp;M)                                                 -5-</span>

because of the fact that if the respondents had decided not to adopt the

GATE examination as a criteria for selection, obviously the examination

conducted in each selection alone would have been the criterion for

appointments to be made in the said selection process, and any score

obtained by a candidate in any previous examinations conducted (in

previous selection processes) by the respondents, would not have been used

as the criterion for selection in a subsequent process.

</p><p id="p_15">              That is to say, that if a person scored 90% marks in a selection

process conducted in the year 2014, (in which year it was not the GATE

examination but the examination conducted by the respondent themselves

that was the criterion for selection), but subsequently if in the selection

process for the year 2015 (again if the examination was conducted by the

respondents with no reference to the GATE examination at all), the

candidate obtained 85% marks, the said candidate naturally could not rely

upon the higher marks obtained by him in 2014, to contend that he must be

selected on the basis of those marks in the year 2015 selection process.

</p><p id="p_16">              Therefore, the purpose of the GATE examination otherwise

essentially being admission to post graduate and doctoral courses in

different central universities of the country, with the score in the said

examination only being adopted by various organizations as a criterion for

the sake of convenience, as also so that a universally acceptable

examination in the country is used as such criterion, I see absolutely no

reason to interfere with the selection process.
</p>
<p id="p_17">9.            This would be especially so due to the fact that the




                                       5 of 7
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                    ::: Downloaded on - 09-12-2017 00:13:35 :::</span>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10"> CWP No.20605 of 2017 (O&amp;M)                                                  -6-</span>

announcement that the GATE 2017 would be the criterion for selection in

the year 2017, was made by way of sufficient notice given, by the

respondents, one year in advance (that the GATE examination conducted in

the year 2017 alone would be used as the criterion).

</p><p id="p_18">10.           The amended regulations not specifying that fact, in my

opinion, would make no difference, as there is no specific bar contained in

the regulation either, and therefore, in the face of the rationale of the

submission made by learned senior counsel appearing for the respondents,

with regard to the respondents conducting separate examinations otherwise

for each selection process, the contention of learned counsel for the

petitioner cannot be accepted.
</p>
<p id="p_19">              Further, it has been stipulated in the amended regulation that

"The vacant posts of Assistant Engineer (Electrical) meant for direct

recruitment in the Nigam would be filled up on the basis of score of GATE

(Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering) examination being conducted by

one of the Indian Institutes of Technology every year subject to fulfillment

of conditions as laid down in Regulation-8 of PSEB Service of Engineering

(Electrical) Regulation, 1965 and amended from time to time."

</p><p id="p_20">              Thus, it cannot be said that the restriction of the criterion for

selection to the last GATE examination conducted, is contrary to

Regulation 10, either.
</p>
<p id="p_21">11.           Learned counsel for the petitioner has also referred to clause

</p><p id="p_22">(ii) of the amended regulation, by which it is stated that the amendment

would be effective from 01.07.2016. He therefore contends that the public




                                       6 of 7
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                    ::: Downloaded on - 09-12-2017 00:13:35 :::</span>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12"> CWP No.20605 of 2017 (O&amp;M)                                                 -7-</span>

notice issued on the same date, i.e. 01.07.2016 (Annexure P-3), being on a

date prior to the amendment (the amendment being effective from

15.07.2016), the notice itself is void.
</p>
<p id="p_23">                The contention of the learned counsel may have been valid if

the advertisement in question itself was issued prior to 15.07.2016, without

the rule having been amended. However, the advertisement being dated

more than one year later, i.e. 28.07.2017, simply an advance notice given

on 01.07.2016, with regard to an examination to be conducted in the year

2017, would not vitiate the condition prescribed in the advertisement of the

year 2017, because by that time the rules also stood amended for more than

one year. Of course, had the examination been conducted prior to

15.07.2016, learned counsels' argument may have been valid.

</p><p id="p_24">                Consequently, that contention is also not acceptable.

                In view of the above, the petition stands dismissed; however,

there shall be no order as to costs.
