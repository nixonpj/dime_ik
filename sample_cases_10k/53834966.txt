<p id="p_1">P.N. Ravindran, J.
</p>
<p id="p_2">      These appeals arise from a common judgment delivered by

the Family Court, Palakkad on 26.04.2012 in O.P. Nos.746 of 2009

and 766 of 2009 respectively.
</p>
<p id="p_3">      2.   The marriage between the appellant and the respondent

was solemnized on 17.01.2007. Alleging that the husband has

deserted her, the respondent wife filed O.P. No.766 of 2009 under

<a href="/doc/932494/" id="a_1">section 13(1)(ia)</a> of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, for a decree of

divorce. She also filed O.P. No.746 of 2009 praying for return of

880.34 grams of gold ornaments in specie or its value. The

appellant husband resisted the petitions. After trial, the Family Court

allowed O.P. No.766 of 2009 and granted a decree dissolving the

marriage between the parties. The Family Court allowed O.P.

No.746 of 2009 and directed the husband to return 880.34 grams of

gold ornaments in specie or to pay its present market value at the

rate of 20,000/- per sovereign within one month from 26.04.2012.

It was also stipulated that in the event of failure, the husband will

                                   ..2..
</p>
<p id="p_4">be liable to pay the same with interest at the rate of 6% per annum

from 26.04.2012 till realization. The husband has, aggrieved

thereby, filed this appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_5">      3.    Pursuant to the order passed by this court, the parties

were referred for mediation. In the mediation talks, the disputes

between the parties were settled. The memorandum of settlement

agreement signed by the parties and their counsel on 31.03.2016

has been placed on record. The memorandum of settlement

agreement discloses that the appellant has agreed to pay a

consolidated sum of 24,00,000/- (Rupees twenty four lakhs only)

in lieu of the value of gold ornaments to the respondent in full and

final settlement of the respondent's claims under the judgment

delivered by the Family Court, Palakkad on 26.04.2012 in

O.P.No.746 of 2009. The appellant has also agreed that he will pay

directly to the wife or deposit in the Family Court, Palakkad, the

arrears of maintenance due and payable in terms of the order

passed by the Family Court, Palakkad in M.C. No.343 of 2012 as on

31.03.2016. The parties have also agreed that such payment will

be made before tendering the sum of 24,00,000/- (Rupees twenty

four lakhs only) towards the value of gold the ornaments. The

memorandum        of   settlement    agreement  discloses that   the

respondent wife has agreed to give up her claim for future

Mat. Appeal Nos. 273 &amp; 274 of 2016
                                   ..3..
</p>
<p id="p_6">maintenance from 01.04.2016 onwards. The parties have also

agreed that it will be open to the appellant to withdraw 5,00,000/-

(Rupees five lakhs only) deposited by him to the credit of E.P.No.13

of 2013 in O.P. No.746 of 2009, after he complies with the

stipulation regarding deposit of the sum of 24,00,000/- (Rupees

twenty four lakhs only) towards the value of the gold ornaments

and discharges his liability to pay maintenance up to 31.03.2016.

The memorandum settlement agreement further recites that in the

event of the appellant husband paying the sum of 24,00,000/-

(Rupees twenty four lakhs only), the respondent wife shall

re-convey the property purchased by her pursuant to the sale held

in E.P.No.13 of 2013 in O.P. No.746 of 2009 on the file of the

Family Court, Palakkad. The parties have also agreed that payment

and the consequential re-conveyance in terms of the settlement

arrived at, will be made on or before 22.08.2016.

</p><p id="p_7">      4.    When this appeal came up for consideration today,

learned counsel appearing for the appellant submitted that payment

of the sum of 24,00,000/- (Rupees twenty four lakhs only) as also

the arrears of maintenance as on 31.03.2016 has been made.

Learned counsel for the respondent was, however, not present to

dispute   the    correctness    of   the said  statement.  In  such

circumstances, as none disputes the aforesaid statement and as the

Mat. Appeal Nos. 273 &amp; 274 of 2016
                                     ..4..
</p>
<p id="p_8">terms of settlement have been complied with by the appellant and it

is for the respondent to effect re-conveyance of the property

purchased by her in execution in terms of the settlement, we are of

the opinion that these appeals can be disposed of, recording the

terms of the settlement.
</p>
<p id="p_9">      We accordingly dispose of these appeals as settled out of

court in terms of the memorandum of settlement agreement dated

31.03.2016. We also record the submission of the learned counsel

appearing for the appellant that the appellant has effected payment

of 24,00,000/- (Rupees twenty four lakhs only) as also the amount

to be paid towards arrears of maintenance till 31.03.2016 and that

the only thing that remains to be done under the terms of the

settlement agreement is the re-conveyance of the property by the

wife and the withdrawal of 5,00,000/- (Rupees five lakhs only) by

the husband from the Family Court, Palakkad. A copy of the

memorandum of settlement agreement shall be appended to this

judgment and the original thereof shall be preserved.
