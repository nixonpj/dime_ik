</pre><p id="p_1">   1.                 The  present   complaint   has   been   filed   on  10.09.2001   by  the 
       Delhi Administration through FI Sh. V.P.S.  Chaudhary against the accused 
       Mohd. Islam. It is stated in the complaint that on 08.05.2001 at about 5.00 
       PM, FI   V.P.S.   Chaudhary purchased a sample of 'Tonned Milk', a food 
       article for analysis from Sh. Mohd. Islam  S/o Sh. Abdul Hamid from the 
       premises of M/s Raja Milk Product, B­121, Main Market, Madipur, Delhi­
       63, where the said article was found stored for sale and where accused 
       Mohd. Islam was found conducting the business of the said food article at 
       the   time   of   sampling.     FI   Sh.   V.P.S.     Chaudhary   purchased   750   ml   of 
       'Tonned   Milk'   (ready   for   sale),  taken   from   an   open   drum   bearing 
       declaration as Tonned Milk.  The sample was taken  under the supervision 
       and   direction   of   Shri   Vijay   Khanna,   SDM/LHA   after   proper 
       homogenization with the help of  dry and clean plunger by rotating it in all 
       possible directions in the drum itself.   Thereafter, the sample was divided 
       into three equal parts by Food Inspector by putting it in three clean and dry 
       bottles and 20 drops of formalin were added to each bottle and thereafter

         each   bottle   containing   the   sample   was   separately   packed,   fastened   and 
        sealed according to the PFA Act and Rules.  The signatures of vendor were 
        obtained on the LHA slip and the wrapper of the bottles containing the 
        sample.  Notice in Form VI was given to accused and price of sample was 
        also given to the accused.  Panchnama was also prepared at the spot.  All 
        these documents prepared by FI Sh. V.P.S.   Chaudhary were signed by 
        accused  Mohd. Islam, the vendor and the other witness namely Sh. Hukam 
        Singh, FI. It is stated that before taking the sample, efforts were made to get 
        the public witnesses to join the proceedings, but none came forward and as 
        such Sh. Hukam Singh, FI joined as witness. 
</p><p id="p_2">   2.                 It is further stated that one counterpart of the sample in intact 
        condition was sent to the Public Analyst, Delhi and two counterparts of the 
        sample in intact conditions were deposited with LHA.  The Public Analyst 
        analyzed the sample and opined that  "The sample does not conform to  
        standard because milk solids not fat is less than the prescribed minimum  
        limit of 8.5%". 
</p><p id="p_3">   3.                 It is further revealed that Sh. Mohd. Islam S/o Abdul Hamid  is 
        the   Vendor­cum­Proprietor   of   M/s   Hans   Sweets   Raja   Milk   Product   and 
        found to be in­charge and responsible for the day to day conduct of the 
        business of the said dairy.  Thereafter, the entire case file was sent to the 
        Director, PFA who accorded the requisite consent U/s 20 of the Act and 
        consequent   thereto   the   present   complaint   was   filed   for   violation   of 
        provisions  of   section  2 ((ia)   (a)  &amp; (m)  of  the PFA Act,  1954 which  is

        pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. 
</p><p id="p_6">   6.                  Thereafter,   prosecution   examined   three   witnesses   namely 
        Sh. V.P.S.  Chaudhary, FI as PW­1, Sh. Hukam Singh, FI as PW­2 and Sh. 
        Vijay Khanna, the then SDM/LHA as PW­3 and PE was closed vide order 
        dated 01.09.2012.

        21.12.2012 wherein accused claimed himself to be innocent and opted to

        in his defence and DE was closed vide order dated 06.03.2013.
</p><p id="p_8">   8.                  I have heard the Ld. Counsel for the parties and perused the 
        record carefully. 
</p><p id="p_9">   9.                  Ld. Counsel  for accused has argued that  sample commodity 
        was   not   properly   homogenized   by  the   Food  Inspector   before   lifting   the 
        sample   which   is   evident   from   the   fact   that   the   sample   failed   only   on 
        account of some short fall in respect of 'milk solids not fat', even otherwise 


CC No. 106/01
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">FI Vs. Mohd. Islam                                                                      Page 4 of 11 </span>
        there is no deficiency in  'milk fat'  content of the sample commodity. He 
       further argued that had accused made any adulteration in the sample, then 
       'milk fat' should have also reduced, but in the present case  'milk fat'  was 
       found higher than the prescribed limit and it shows that accused has not 
       made any adulteration in the sample. He further argued that cow may not 
       have   been   properly   fed   which   has   resulted   in   some   deficiency   in  'milk  
       solids not fat'  of the sample commodity of 'Tonned Milk' and therefore it 
       cannot  be said that  milk was not pure or that milk was adulterated. To 
       fortify this argument, Ld. Counsel for accused has relied upon the judgment 
       passed by  the Hon'ble Punjab and Haryana High Court in Bhai Singh Vs.  
       State of Haryana, Criminal Revision  No. 302 of 1996.  Ld.   Counsel   for 
       accused has further argued that the deficiency in the sample of Tonned Milk 
       was only in respect of 'milk solids not fat'  and if the percentage of 'milk  
       fat' and 'milk solids not fat' are added, it meets the total requirement of fat 
       content of the sample commodity and, therefore, sample cannot be said to 
       have failed only on account of shortfall in respect of 'milk solids not fat'.  
       In this regard, he has relied upon the case law titled as "Administrator of  
       the City of Nagpur Vs.  Laxman &amp; Anr.  Crl. No. 132 of 1986." 
</p><p id="p_10">   10.                On the other hand, Ld. SPP for complainant has argued that 
       sample commodity was required to be conforming to the standard in respect 
       of  'milk   fat'  and  'milk   solids   not   fat'  separately,   whereas     the   sample 
       commodity failed on account of 'milk solids not fat', which was found less 
       than the prescribed requirement and therefore, even if total fat comes more

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">FI Vs. Mohd. Islam                                                                    Page 5 of 11 </span>
        than the prescribed requirement, same is of no avail. He further argued that 
       Food Inspector was not required to see whether the cow is properly fed or 
       not and since the sample was found not conforming to the standard as 'milk 
       solids not fat' was found deficient in the sample, the accused has violated 
       the provisions of PFA Act and hence is liable to be convicted.

        from him for analysis.  The sample of Tonned Milk was sent to the Public 
       Analyst (PA) for analysis who after analysing the sample vide his report 
       dated 16.05.2001 found the same not conforming  to the standard because 
       'milk solid not fat'  was less than the prescribed minimum limit of 8.5%. 
       The report of Public Analyst has been exhibited and proved as Ex. PW­1/G 
       on   the   basis   of   which   present   complaint   has   been   launched   against   the 
       accused. 
</p><p id="p_20">   19.                The     defence   of   the   accused   from   the   aforesaid   cross­
       examination of PWs appears to be that milk was not properly homogenized 
       by the Food Inspector before lifting the sample. In his statement U/s 313 
       <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_6">Cr.P.C</a> also, the accused has contended FI did not homogenize the sample 
       commodity before taking the sample. 
</p><p id="p_21">   20.                It is evident from the report of Public Analyst Ex. PW1/G that 
       sample of Tonned Milk failed only in respect of 'milk solids not fat' which 
       was found to be 7.64% as against the minimum prescribed limit of 8.5%, 
       whereas 'milk fat' was found to be 4.7% which is more than the prescribed 
       minimum limit. In a criminal Revision titled as  Bhai Singh Vs. State of  
       Haryana (supra) relied upon by the Ld. Counsel for accused, the Hon'ble 
       Punjab and Haryana High Court after referring the judgment of the Hon'ble 
       Division Bench reported in  State of Punjab Vs. Gian Chand, 1991 (3)  
       RCR 278 held that if there is a deficiency in the milk solids not fat and if 
       there is no deficiency in milk fat, in such a situation, it cannot be said that 
       the milk was not pure. The only inference in such a case which can be

        drawn is that buffalo was not properly fed. 
</p><p id="p_22">   21.                In the present case also, the standard of  'milk fat'  is fulfilled 
       and only deficiency is only in respect of 'milk solids not fat'. Therefore, in 
       view of law laid down in the authority cited supra, I find substance in the 
       contention of Ld. Counsel for accused that the deficiency in  'milk solids  
       not fat' could be on account of the fact that cow was not properly fed and it 
       cannot be said that the accused has made any adulteration in the sample of 
       'Tonned Milk.' 
</p><p id="p_23">   22.                Even   otherwise,   as   stated   above,   the   only   shortfall   in   the 
       sample of Tonned Milk was in respect of  'milk solids not fat' which was 
       found to be 7.64% as against the minimum prescribed limit of 8.5%.  In an 
       appeal filed before the Hon'ble Supreme Court titled as  Administrator of  
       the City of Nagpur  Vs.  Laxman &amp; Anr cited supra,  the sample of cow's 
       milk was taken in which the fat percentage was 6% as against 3.5%, which 
       was more than the prescribed for cow's milk.  The only shortfall was that 
       SNF which was 7.3%, whereas it ought to have been 8.5%.  Further it was 
       noted   that   the   total   solids   were   13.37   which   was   again   more   than   the 
       satisfying   standard   of   cow's   milk   and   under   those   circumstance,   the 
       Hon'ble Supreme Court held that it cannot be said that courts below have 
       erred in acquitting the accused giving the benefit of doubt.

       (P&amp;H), the analyst reported the sample adulterated as milk solid not fat 
       contents   were   7.7%   and   deficiency   was   to   the   tune   of   0.8%,  while   the

        percentage of fat was 5.4% which was higher than the prescribed standard, 
       it   was   held   that   inference   could   be   drawn   that   either   sample   was   not 
       properly taken or analyzed or cow was not properly fed.  
</p><p id="p_25">   24.                The facts of the present case are squarely covered under the 
       aforesaid   authorities.   In   the   present   case   also,   as   per   report   of   Public 
       Analyst (PA), the 'milk solids not fat' of the sample commodity of Tonned 
       Milk was found to be 7.64% as against the minimum requirement of 8.5% 
       and the 'milk fat' was found to be 4.7% as against the prescribed minimum 
       limit of 3.5% and if percentage of both 'milk fat' and 'milk solids not fat' 
       are added, the total fats comes to 12.34% which is more than the prescribed 
       limit of 12%. Therefore, in view of law laid down in the authority cited 
       supra, the accused can not be convicted on the basis of shortfall in SNF as 
       total fats are more than the prescribed requirement.

       considered opinion that the prosecution has failed to prove its case against 
       the accused beyond reasonable doubt, benefit of which must go in favour of 
       accused.   Accordingly, benefit of doubt is given to the accused and the 
       accused is acquitted of the charges leveled against him.
