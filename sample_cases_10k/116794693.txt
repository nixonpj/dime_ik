</p><p id="p_32"> 13.     Thus, to prove the guilt of the accused u/s 25 <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_19">Arms Act</a>, the prosecution was 

under bounden duty to prove the following ingredients:

</p><p id="p_33">1.That   the   accused   has   acquired   in   his   possession   or   was   carrying   firearm   or 

ammunition;
</p>
<p id="p_34">2.That the firearm or ammunition satisfies the definition in <a href="/doc/124983/" id="a_20">Section 2</a>;

</p><p id="p_35">3.That, in contravention to <a href="/doc/1092263/" id="a_21">Section 3</a> Arms Act, the accused does not hold in this behalf 

a licence issued in accordance with the provisions of this Act and the rules made there 

under;
</p>
<p id="p_36">4.That necessary sanction u/s 39 <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_22">Arms Act</a> from district Magistrate for institution of 

prosecution has been taken.
</p>
<p id="p_37">14.     To prove the allegations against the accused, the prosecution examined PW1 HC 

Lalan Pande, PW2 HC Dalbir Singh and PW3 HC Vikram. No other witness has been 

examined in the present case. As per the prosecution case, PW1 and PW3 apprehended 

the accused in possession of a pistol and cartridge. PW1 deposed that on the fateful day, 

the   accused   alighted   from   a  bus   and  tried  to  run away  while PW2  deposed  that   he 

noticed that the accused was standing at the bus stand and on secret information they 

rushed towards the accused and apprehended him. This is a material contradiction in the 

statements of two witnesses who allegedly apprehended the accused. No public witness 

is   cited   or   examined   by   the   prosecution   to  support   their   case   or   to  corroborate   the 

testimony of the witnesses. The time of apprehension was 8.45 pm and the place was bus 

stop Kanjhawala which is supposed to be crowded place. No public person is joined in 

the investigation which makes the prosecution story dilatory.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                                                                                           7</span>
</p><p id="p_38"> 15.     The IO SI Amla Nand has not been examined. It  is   deposed  by PW 2 HC Dalbir 

during his chief examination that the case property was sealed by the IO  with the seal of 

ANM and after use, it was handed over him.  The seal was not given to any independent 

person or was not deposited in the malkhana to assail the possibility of misuse. Thus the 

tampering of the case property by the police officials cannot also be ruled out in the 

present case.
</p>
<p id="p_39">16.     The present case totally rests upon the alleged recovery of the case property from 

the possession of the accused at the relevant time.  The arrival and departure entries of 

the police officials who apprehended the accused with case property is a  vital piece of 

evidence. Conspicuously, no departure or arrival entries in the daily diary register, of 

PW 1 HC Lalan Pande and PW3 HC Vikram Singh who allegedly apprehended the 

accused in possession of firearm is not furnished and proved on record.   The police 

officials are under the statutory duty to mark their departure and arrival in the register 

kept for the purpose as per the PPR rules.   It is apposite at this juncture to reproduce 

Chapter 22 Rule 49 of Punjab Police Rules, 1934, provides as under: 

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">          "22.49 Matters to be entered in Register No. II - The following matters  
          shall, amongst others, be entered:

          This   entry   shall   be   made   immediately   on   arrival   or   prior   to   the  
          departure of the officer concerned and shall be attested by the latter

</p><p id="p_42"> 17.     PW 3 HC Dalbir Singh deposed that IO seized the case property vide memo Ex 

PW1/C and thereafter rukka was prepared and FIR was got registered through him. If 

the FIR was registered later to the preparation of Seizure memo Ex.PW1/C, then it is a 

mystical question as to how the FIR number has appeared on the seizure memo for 

which no explanation has been rendered by the prosecution.

</p><p id="p_43">18.     Now,   the   other   question   whether   the   case   property   seized   in   the   present   case 

comes within the definition of firearm or ammunition has to proved by the FSL report. 

Surprisingly in the present case, the FSL report is not filed on record. No witness has 

been examined who could prove that the case property was sent to FSL or the report was 

received from the FSL. No supplementary challan has been filed for furnishing the FSL 

report   on   record.   Thus,   the   very   question   whether   the   thing   found   in   possession   of 

accused was firearm/ammunition is not solved and the prosecution case fails on this 

aspect also.
</p>
<p id="p_44">19.     Now coming the last and very important question whether the sanction u/s 39 

<a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_23">Arms Act</a> was taken in the present case or not, it is pertinent to mention that sanction u/s 

39 <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_24">Arms Act</a> is a condition precedent for institution of prosecution. In the present case, 

the said sanction has not been obtained and has not been proved on record.

<p id="p_46">21.     In 2002 CRI. L. J. 2892 <a href="/doc/109950251/" id="a_29">S. Mange Naik v. State of A.P</a>., it was observed that:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_6">        "6. Thus, as per <a href="/doc/534261/" id="a_30">Section 39</a>, no prosecution can be instituted without the previous  
        sanction of the District Magistrate. The sanction as contemplated under<a href="/doc/534261/" id="a_31"> S. 39</a> of  
        the Act is not an empty formality and it is introduced to safeguard the persons  
        against any false or frivolous prosecution. When once a sanction order is issued  
        by the District Magistrate, somebody on behalf of the Department  shall come  
        before   the   Court   and   mark   the   same   as   an   exhibit.   In   the   instant   case,   on  a  
        reading of the judgment of the trial Court, it is clear that the sanction order,  
        though obtained from the District Magistrate concerned, has not been marked as  
        an exhibit and the same cannot, therefore, be used as evidence. Without exhibiting  
        the sanction order in Court as per the provisions of <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_32">Evidence Act</a> it is not safe to  
        rely on the sanction order which is there in the record. May be that the sanction  
        order is inserted into the record. This point was, however, not canvassed before  
        the trial Court.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_7">                         8. I do not think, the view adopted by the learned Sessions Judge in  
        accepting the sanction order even though it is not marked in evidence, is correct.  
        Unless and until it is marked and proved in accordance with the provisions of the  
        <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_33">Evidence  Act</a>,  the  learned  Sessions Judge ought not have taken the same into  
        consideration.   Therefore,   when   the   sanction   order   is   not   proved,   the   learned  
        Sessions Judge instead of deciding the appeal ought to have remitted the case to  
        the trial Court for further trial a when once the sanction order as required under  
       <a href="/doc/534261/" id="a_34"> S.   39</a>   of   the   Act   was   not   produced   or   proved   by   the   prosecution,   it   must   be  
        concluded that the prosecution launched against the petitioner is bad in law and  
        the petitioner is, therefore, entitled for acquittal."

 observed that:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_8">        "7.   I   have   already   shown   above   that   the   requirements   of   the   law   regarding  
        recovery of weapons have not been fulfilled and the evidence is also not worth  
        reliance. The accused persons have been prosecuted under <a href="/doc/73862/" id="a_36">Section 25</a> Arms Act  
        as well. <a href="/doc/534261/" id="a_37">Section 39</a> of the Arms Act provides that previous sanction of the District  
        Magistrate is necessary for the prosecution against any person in respect of any  
        offence   under   <a href="/doc/1092263/" id="a_38">Section   3</a>.   <a href="/doc/1092263/" id="a_39">Section   3</a>   provides   for   licence   for   acquisition   and  
        possession of firearms and ammunition. Thus, unless there is a previous sanction  
        of the District Magistrate a person cannot be prosecuted in respect of any offence  
        under  <a href="/doc/1092263/" id="a_40">Section   3</a>.   <a href="/doc/73862/" id="a_41">Section  25</a> provides for an offence relating to possession on  
        carrying   any   prohibited   arms   or   prohibited   ammunition   in   contravention   of  
        <a href="/doc/1092263/" id="a_42">Section 3</a>. There are other provisions as well to which we are not concerned as in  
        the present case the prosecution has claimed that the accused persons were in  
        possession   of   arms   and   ammunition   without   any   licence.   Thus,   sanction   was  
        necessary   and   in   the   absence   of   sanction   the   accused   persons   could   not   be  
        prosecuted at all in spite of the fact that they were in possession of any unlicenced  
        arm though that fact has not been proved in the case in hand. Learned presiding  
        officer,   ought   to   have   known   the   provisions   of   <a href="/doc/534261/" id="a_43">Section   39</a>   Arms   Act.   It   is  
        unfortunate that without looking to this provision and without caring to marshall  
        the evidence properly and going to the fact that requirements of law have not been  
        fulfilled, he held the accused guilty of the offence punishable under <a href="/doc/73862/" id="a_44">Section 25</a>,  
        <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_45">Arms Act</a>. In the present case nothing has been said by any witness whatsoever  
        that sanction was obtained for the prosecution u/S. 25. I may point out here that  
        sanction is not a mere formality. It has to be proved that it was granted by the  
        authority after applying his mind. It must be shown that the firearm or weapon  
        with respect to which sanction was prayed was actually taken to the authority  
        concerned and after looking to if the relevant papers, understanding and after  
        applying his mind sanction was granted. In this case, there is complete absence of  
        the sanction. The accused could not, therefore, be convicted at all."
</blockquote><p id="p_48">23.     Relying on the aforesaid precedents, this court safely concludes that in absence of 

the sanction u/s 39 <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_46">Arms Act</a>, the accused cannot be convicted and is entitled to the
