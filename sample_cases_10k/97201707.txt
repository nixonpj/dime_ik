         CORAM: HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE SANJAY KUMAR
ORAL JUDGMENT
Date: 10-05-2017

          Heard Mr. Arbind Nath Pandey, the counsel for the petitioner,

   Mr. Abhay Kumar Singh, the counsel for the O.P. No. 2

   (complainant) as well as Mrs. Renuka Ratnakar, APP for the State.

</p><p id="p_5">   2.     The petitioner seeks quashing of the order dated 25.08.2011,

   passed by the Judicial Magistrate, 1st Class, Rohtas in G.R. No. 4 of

   2010/Trial No. 2374 of 2011. The Learned Magistrate, as per

   impugned order, refused to discharge the petitioner from the offence

   Under <a href="/doc/1101188/" id="a_1">Sections 379</a>, <a href="/doc/812083/" id="a_2">411</a> and <a href="/doc/988620/" id="a_3">406</a> of the Indian Penal Code and

   directed the petitioner to appear physically for framing of the charge.

</p><p id="p_6">   3.     The facts in brief is that on 02.12.2010, the O.P. No. 2

   (complainant) lodged a case with S.H.O. O.P. Karagahar, district-

   Rohtas alleging therein that partition amongst his three brothers took

   place and as per memo of partition, some lands and a tractor bearing

        No. BR-24 A 1997 along with its accessories came in his share. After

        the said partition, he went to Varanasi and when he returned back did

        not find the tractor and accessories on Darwaja. He subsequently, got

        information that his elder brother who is the petitioner before this

        Court dishonestly and stealthily removed the said tractor and

        concealed the same at the place of his in-laws. Accordingly, a Police

        Case vide Karghar P.S. Case No. 03 of 2010 was registered for the

        offence Under <a href="/doc/1101188/" id="a_4">Section 379</a> of the Indian Penal Code.                          During

        investigation, the tractor, in question, was recovered by police from

        one Chandeshwar Dubey and subsequently the same was released in

        favour of the petitioner on his undertaking. The case was found true

        under <a href="/doc/1101188/" id="a_5">Section 379</a>, <a href="/doc/812083/" id="a_6">411</a> of the Indian Penal Code and charge-sheet

        was submitted, on the basis of which, the court below took cognizance

        of offence under <a href="/doc/1101188/" id="a_7">Sections 379</a> and <a href="/doc/812083/" id="a_8">411</a> of the Indian Penal Code as per

        order     dated      15.12.2010.           The     petitioner   filed   a   Criminal

        Miscellaneous No. 22643 of 2011 for quashing the cognizance order

        dated 15.12.2010, which after some arguments was withdrawn by the

        petitioner as by that time, the petition to discharge the petitioner was

        rejected by the court below. The said order has been assailed before

        this Court for quashing the same.
</p>
<p id="p_7">        4.       The learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the petitioner

        is the owner of the tractor and its accessories. The said tractor was

        purchased after taking loan and he being the sole owner sold the same

        to one Chandeshwar Dubey on 05.01.2008 to the knowledge of O.P.

        No.2 and family members.                   The family property has not been

        partitioned as alleged by the complainant.             The memorandum of

        partition produced on behalf of the complainant is fabricated which is

        apparent from the fact that the father and mother have not been given

        any share in the said memorandum of partition. The owner book

        stands in the name of this petitioner and he had/has legal right to use

        or transfer the same and. In this view of the matter, no offence under

        <a href="/doc/1101188/" id="a_9">Sections 379</a>, <a href="/doc/812083/" id="a_10">411</a> is made out and the impugned order is fit to be

        quashed.
</p>
<p id="p_8">        5.       The learned counsel for the O.P. No. 2 (complainant) as well as

        APP for the State opposed the submissions.
</p>
<p id="p_9">        6.       Perused the documents on records and L.C.R. It is not in

        dispute that the aforesaid tractor stands registered in the name of this

        petitioner. The police, in course of investigation, recovered the tractor

        and the same was released in favour of this petitioner considering his

        ownership. The petitioner being the rightful owner has every right to

        deal with the property in question.                In the case in hand, the

        complainant disputes the right of the petitioner and claims the said

        tractor as his own under family partition which is denied by the

        petitioner. The dispute between the parties appears to be a civil

        dispute relating to ownership of the tractor which stands registered in

        the name of this petitioner. The ownership and legal right can be

        ascertained only after adjudication and in this view of the matter, the

        ingredients of <a href="/doc/1101188/" id="a_11">Sections 379</a>, <a href="/doc/812083/" id="a_12">411</a> and <a href="/doc/988620/" id="a_13">406</a> of the Indian Penal Code are

                  lacking so as to make the offence of theft or criminal breach of trust.

                  A Partition Suit No. 154 of 2010 is pending before the court of Sub

                  Judge-I, Rohtas in which the complainant has filed his written

                  statement. The offence of theft has been defined in <a href="/doc/1280620/" id="a_14">Section 378</a> of the

                  I.P.C. according to which theft consists in the dishonest taking of any

                  movable property out of the possession of another without his

                  consent. Dishonest intention exists when the person so taking the

                  property intends to cause wrongful gain to himself or wrongful loss to

                  the other. The petitioner being registered owner of the tractor had/has

                  legal right to use the vehicle in the manner he liked/likes.          The

                  petitioner, moved the tractor/accessories in the assertion of his bona

                  fide claim of right and so this act of the petitioner does not fall within

                  the offence of theft.
</p>
<p id="p_10">                  7.       In this view of the matter, the criminal prosecution of petitioner

                  would amount to misuse of process of Court.              The order dated

                  25.08.2011, is not sustainable and is, accordingly, set aside and the

                  prosecution of the petitioner is quashed.

<p id="p_11">                           This application stands allowed.
