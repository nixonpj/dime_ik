ORDER ON THE POINT OF SENTENCE:

21.01.2009

Pre: Ld. APP for the state.

      Accused Aftab and Akbar in person with their counsel.

      Ld. counsel for accused persons argued on sentence and

submitted that accused persons had remained in JC for about 1 month

during the course of trial in the beginning. Ld. counsel for accused

persons submitted that accused are very poor persons and are of

young age.   They have more liabilities of their family.    Ld. counsel

further submitted that during the course of trial     father of accused

persons had expired and now the liability widow mother has come on

their shoulders. On these grounds ld. counsel prayed that a lenient

view be taken at the time of awarding the sentence.    Contrary to the

submissions of ld. counsel for the accused persons,            ld. APP

argued and submitted that a severe punishment may be awarded so
                                     2

that a strong message be given in the society that law is very strict to

culprits.

       Keeping in view of the present scenario, age, antecedents and

family circumstances of accused persons, their inclinations for

improving behavior in the society and the old pendency of the matter

pending since 2004.     Further, accused are facing trial by regularly

appearing in the court for trial and also observing a change of

philosophy of punishment in modern era, changing its orientation

from retribution to restitution, treating the accused as patient who

needs treatment rather than punishment and changing its aptitude from

offence oriented justice to accused, oriented justice from socialistic

approach to individualistic and with the observations that the

compassion to record that no money can compensate the life in any

manner but only solace can be given by way of token of compensatory

justice to the family, in modern era where a philosophy of restitution

has taken a place of the retribution for punishment in criminal justice

system, only for the reasons that the penal punishment by way of

imprisonment may ruin the family of the accused persons that consists

of the ailing parents depending on the accused, also expressing a

feeling that an order for probation is not appropriate for such cases in

which crime has resulted in loss of life in view of the observations made

in the authority of the Apex Curt yet treating the case of the present
                                    3

accused as a special case that needs a sense of passion for the family

members of accused persons who should not inclined towards

criminality in the absence of accused for their survival.   In this case

father of accused persons has expired during the course of trial and

now they have widow mother to look after, they are of very young age

therefore, court is of the considered view that ends of justice shall be

met if accused persons are released on probation of good conduct for

the period of 2 years on furnishing personal bond in the sum of

Rs.5000/- each with one surety in the like amount.

            Accordingly, accused persons are released
            on probation of good conduct for the period
            of 2 years on furnishing personal bond in the
            sum of Rs.5000/- each with one surety in the
            like amount.

     JUDGEMENT
</pre>

<p id="p_1">  1. Briefly facts of the case are that the alleged incident occurred on

     the Independence Day i.e. on 15.8.2004 in this case when victim

     Sabir s/o Sh. Sultan was going inside of his house after lifting a

     kite, accused Afaq, who was the father of the other two accused

     persons (now deceased) caught hold the victim, accused Akbar

     gave him leg and fist blows while accused Aftab gave a blow

     with brick on the head of victim Sabir.    After that a DD No.16A

     with regard to the quarrel was got recorded in the police station.

     Constable Kare Lal, No.1452 North East who was present in the

     police station received a DD No.16A from duty officer which

     was handed over to SI N.P. Deshwal for investigation.

     Thereafter, both of them went to Nai Seema Puri Jhuggies near
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                5</span>

  Kabristan where they came to know that injured had already

  been removed to GTB Hospital. They went to GTB Hospital

  where IO obtained the MLC of the injured. Statement of injured

  was recorded by the IO. On the statement of injured/ victim

  present case was got registered against accused persons.

  Injured / victim Sabir led the IO to the houses of accused

  persons who caused injuries to him. At the instance of victim, all

  three accused were apprehended from the Jhuggies of Nai

  Seema Puri and their arrest memos were prepared.



</p><p id="p_2">2. After hearing arguments on charge, charge for the offence u/s

  308/34 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_5">IPC</a> was framed by my ld. Predecessor       on 21.02.05 to

  which accused persons did not plead guilty and claimed trial.

  Prosecution in this case has examined 7 witnesses namely PW1

  Dr. Devender, CMO, GTB hospital, PW2 Sabir -victim, PW3 Ct.

  Kare Lal, PW4 Jarina -eye witness, PW5 ASI Badlu Singh, PW6

  Ex. ASI Ram Khiladi and PW7 SI N. P. Deshpal - Investigating

  Officer of this case.
</p>
<p id="p_3">

</p><p id="p_4">3. PW1 Dr. Davender, CMO GTB Hospital, Shahdara appeared in

  the witness box on 08.11.05 and his statement was recorded.

  On perusal of his testimony it has been observed that on
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                6</span>

  15.8.2004 victim Sabir s/o Sultan aged 28 years male was

  examined by Dr. Rajeev Shekhar, the then ACMO at about 7:40

  p.m who was brought to the hospital with the alleged history of

  assault. This witness was working as CMO in the hospital on

  that day and MLC Ex.PW1/A was prepared by Dr. Rajeev

  Shekhar. It has also been observed that Dr. Rajeev Shekhar

  has left the services of the hospital and his present whereabout

  are not known.     This witness identified the handwriting and

  signatures of doctor Rajeev Shekhar at point A as he had seen

  him writing and signing during ordinary course of his duties.   It

  was narrated that as per this MLC, on local examination, a

  lacerated would on saggital suture of the size of 3 x 0.5 cm was

  found. He further narrated that the patient was complaining of

  chest pain and his Vitals were found normal and no abnormality

  was deducted and the patient was fit for statement and blunt

  weapon of offence was suspected to have been used and

  injuries were under observation.     This witness has not been

  cross-examined.
</p>
<p id="p_5">

</p><p id="p_6">4. In this case the most material witness is PW2 Sabir s/o Sh.

  Sultan being victim.      He has categorically     stated that on

  15.8.2004 when he was present outside his house and was
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                7</span>

  going inside of his house after lifting one kite fell down on the

  ground   accused Afaq, who was the father of the other two

  accused persons caught hold him and accused Akbar gave him

  leg and fist blows. He further pointed out towards accused Aftab

  and stated that accused Aftab gave a blow with brick on his

  head. He testified that after receiving brick blow on his head

  blood started oozing out. He stated that all accused persons ran

  away from the spot. This witness further stated that from the

  spot he proceeded towards the police station and on the way

  one police official met him who took him to GTB hospital got him

  admitted there. Police made enquiries from him. His statement

  was recorded, which is Ex.PW2/A which bears his thumb

  impression at point A. This witness further testified that when he

  came back from the hospital, police reached at the spot and

  prepared site plan at his instance. This witness has correctly

  identified all the accused persons. This witness has been cross-

  examined by the defence counsel at length. I have perused the

  same.    I found some minor type of contradictions which are

  attributable due to the long duration of time and memory of a

  human being.
</p>
<p id="p_7">5. PW3 Ct. Kare Lal, No.1452 NE stated that on 15.08.2004 he was

  posted as Ct. at police station Seemapuri. On that day on receipt
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                               8</span>

of DD No.16A from duty officer he handed it over to SI N.P.

Deshwal. Thereafter, both went to Nai Seema Puri Jhuggies

near Kabristan. He further stated that there they came to know

that injured had already been removed to GTB Hospital. They

went to GTB Hospital where IO obtained the MLC of the injured.

Statement of injured was recorded by the IO. IO sent him to the

police station along with the rukka for registration of the case and

after registration of the case, he came back to the spot, handed

over the copy of the FIR along with rukka to SI NP Deshpal to

whom further investigation was marked.         This witness again

stated that in his presence, the injured had taken the IO to the

house of accused persons who had caused injuries to him. All

the three accused were apprehended from Jhuggies of Nai

Seema Puri, behind the place of incident. Their arrest memos

were prepared. This witness has correctly identified all the three

accused persons. This witness further proved the arrest memo

of accused Afaque Khan as Ex.PW3/A and of Akbar Khan as

Ex.PW3/B and of Aftab as Ex.PW3/C bearing his signatures at

point A respectively.    He further proved the personal search

memo of Afaque Khan as Ex.PW3/D and of Akbar Khan as

Ex.PW3/E and of Aftab Khan as Ex.PW3/E. He further stated

that accused persons were brought to the police station after
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                   9</span>

  their arrest.    This witness has been cross-examined by the

  defence counsel. I have perused the same. No evidence of the

  nature has come on record which can suggest that this witness is

  false one or is not reliable.
</p>
<p id="p_8">

</p><p id="p_9">6. PW4 Jarina w/o Sharif has been examined. This witness is also

  most material witness being eye-witness. She has stated that on

  15.08.2004, after finishing her work at about 5 PM, she came to

  the house of her sister. She stated that after around 20 minutes

  she noticed that accused Afaq Khan and his two sons namely

  Akbar Khan and Aftab Khan were quarreling with her sister's son

  Sabir.     She also    categorically and specifically stated that

  accused Afaq Khan was holding Sabir whereas Aftab was

  beating him in the meantime Akbar Khan lifted a brick from the

  gali and hit Sabir on his head with the brick as a result of which

  Sabir sustained injuries on his head. She further stated that after

  seeing blood oozing out of the head of Sabir she became

  nervous and collapsed. She again stated that after some time

  police came and recorded her statement when she regained her

  consciousness.
</p>
<p id="p_10">           This witness has been cross-examined at length.       On

  perusal of his cross-examination and examination in chief I found
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                               10</span>

  some minor type of contradictions which are attributable due to

  the long duration of time and memory of a human being.

  However, this witness has narrated clear facts of the case and

  role of the accused persons. Her testimony duly corroborates

  with the testimony of PW2 victim Sabir.
</p>
<p id="p_11">

  came in the witness box and stated that on 15.8.2004, he was

  information he recorded DD No.16A in this regard. He has also

  brought with him the original DD register and true copy of the

  same and proved the same as Ex.PW5/A. (Original were seen

  and returned).   The said DD was sent to SI N.P. Deshwal

  through Ct. Kare Lal. He again testified that on the same night at

  about 9:30 P.M. he received one rukka brought by Ct. Kare Lal

  and on the basis of the same he recorded FIR of this case with

  his own hand. He brought the original with him and proved the

  of the same was sent to SI N.P. Deshwal through Ct. Kare Lal for

  further   investigation.   This   witness   further   proved   the

  endorsement on the same as Ex.PW5/C.
</p>
<p id="p_13">        This witness has been cross examined by Sh. S.S.

  further stated that victim Sabir was suffering from bleeding from

  his head who told him that he had been beaten by Afaq Khan,

  GTB hospital and got him admitted there. He also stated that in

  the meantime ASI N.P. Deshpal reached in the hospital who

  recorded his statement. This witness has been cross-examined

</p><p id="p_16">9. In this case PW7 SI N. P. Deshpal is the most material witness

  being Investigating Officer of this case.             For the sake of brevity

  and convenience his testimony is being re-produced verbatim

  which is as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">         " On 15.08.2004 I was posted as Sub Inspector in Police Station,
          Seemapuri, Delhi. On that day, DD No.16A already exhibited as
          Ext. PW5/A was received to me for investigation. On receipt of
          said DD, I along with Constable Kare Lal went to E-44 Jhuggy
          near Kabristan where we came to know that a quarrel is taking
          place inside the gali. We went inside the gali and enquired from
          there and we came to know that Sabir injured had already gone
          to the Hospital. From there, we went to GTB Hospital where I
          obtained the MLC of injured Sabir. He was declared fit for
          statement by the Doctor. I obtained the statement of Sabir. From
          the perusal of MLC as well as the statement of injured, the
          offences under <a href="/doc/1599401/" id="a_6">Sections 341</a>/<a href="/doc/4266/" id="a_7">308</a>/<a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_8">34</a> IPC are made out. I
          prepared a rukka on the statement of Sabir and sent constable
          Kare Lal for registration of FIR at P.S Seemapuri. I reached at
          the spot and later on injured also reached there. I prepared the
          Site Plan at the instance of injured. The same is Ext. PW7/A and
          recorded the statement of the witnesses. In the meanwhile,
          constable Kare Lal also reached at the spot with the copy of the
          FIR and rukka in original which he handed over to me.
          Thereafter, I made search for accused. All the three accused
          persons namely Afaq Khan, Akbar Khan and Aftab Khan were
          found present in Jhuggy No. E-44/A107. The injured was also
          present with me at the time of arrest of accused persons. He left
          the police party after pointing out of the jhuggy of accused
          persons. I arrested the accused persons vide arrest memo Ext.
          PW3/A, Ext. PW3/B and Ext. PW3/C and also prepared their
          personal search memos Ext. PW3/D, Ext. PW3/E and Ext.
          PW3/F. Accused persons were brought in the police station and
          put up in the lock up. MLC was deposited in the Hospital for
          obtaining the opinion and after taking opinion challan was
          prepared and file was put up before the SHO who prepared the
          challan and filed the same in the Court."

<p id="p_17">   This witness has been cross-examined by the defence counsel

   at length.   In the cross-examination it has come on record that

   he received DD No.16A from Constable Kare Lal at around 5.45

   p.m. They reached at the spot within fifteen minutes. He cannot
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                            13</span>

tell the name of person who disclosed to him that injured had

been shifted to the Hospital. One lady Zarina met him in a crowd

at the spot when he first reached at the spot but he did not

record her statement at that time as he was not aware whether

she was witness to the incident or not. Voltd. he recorded the

statement of Zarine when he came from the Hospital at the spot.

He reached at the hospital around 6.15 or 6.20 p.m where

injured Sabir and one ASI Khilari Ram of P S Seemapuri met

him. No relative of Sabir met him in the Hospital. He sent rukka

through constable Kare Lal at about 9/9.15 p.m. Constable Kare

Lal came at the spot with the copy of FIR around 10/10.15 p.m.

Injured Sabir came at the spot on the same day, but he does not

recollect the exact time when he met him at the spot. Injured

came at the spot from the Hospital by the time constable Kare

Lal reached at the spot.   He only recorded the statement of

Zarina at the spot and supplementary statement of injured Sabir

at the spot. He conducted the writing work while standing at the

spot. It took about one and half hours/two hours in completing

the writing work at the spot. He does not recollect the time of

arrest of accused persons. Voltd. He had mentioned the same in

the arrest memo. During the aforesaid period of one and half

hour/two hours, accused were also arrested. He reached in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                             14</span>

police station around at night hours but he cannot tell the exact

time. Voltd. He had made arrival entry in the roznamcha. He

recorded the statement of ASI Ram Khilari and Constable Kare

Lal in the police station after putting the accused persons in the

lock up. This witness denied the suggestion that he is deposing

falsely and accused persons have been falsely implicated in the

present case in connivance with the complainant.

On careful perusal of the testimony of PW7 SI/ IO it reveals that

he visited the spot after receiving the DD no.16 and after that

they reached at GTB hospital where injured/victim met him

where they recorded the statement injured.    It has further been

observed that accused persons were arrested at the instance of

victim and site plan was also prepared at the instance of victim.

It has further come on record that statement of Zaria, the eye

witness was also recorded who is very crucial witness in this

case being eye-witness. Ld. counsel for the accused persons

has miserably failed to establish that witness Zarina is a bogus

witness.   Further, on careful cross-examination of this witness

it has also been confirmed that       statement of Zarina was

recorded by the IO and that injured Sabir met in the hospital to

the IO. Arrest of accused persons has also been proved who

were arrested at the instance of victim. Hence, defence counsel
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                                 15</span>

   in the cross-examination of this witness has failed to prove that

   IO had not done his duty properly and in accordance with law.



</p><p id="p_18">10.After   recording   the   statement   of   prosecution   witnesses,

   Statement of accused persons u/s 313 Cr. P.C. was recorded.

   Accused persons have denied all the allegations by stating that

   witnesses are interested witnesses and they have been falsely

   implicated in this case. However, they have not led any defence

   evidence.
</p>
<p id="p_19">

</p><p id="p_20">11.Final arguments of accused persons were heard. Ld. APP has

   also argued its case at length. During the course of argument

   accused persons submitted that their father namely Afaq who

   was accused in this case has expired.       They further submitted

   that they are innocent persons and have been falsely implicated

   in this case.       Contrary to the submissions of accused

   persons, ld. APP argued that there are sufficient material on

   record to convict the accused persons for the offence under

   <a href="/doc/4266/" id="a_9">section 308</a> / <a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_10">34</a> IPC as injury of injured has been proved on

   record by doctor PW1.        He further argued that there is no

   dispute with regard to the identity of accused persons. All the

   material witnesses have correctly identified the accused persons.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                                      16</span>

   Role of accused persons has also been proved on record

   specifically.

<p id="p_21">

</p><p id="p_22">12.Before reaching at the conclusion let the <a href="/doc/4266/" id="a_11">section 308</a> IPC be re-

   produced verbatim for the sake and brevity which is as under:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">         <a href="/doc/4266/" id="a_12">Section 308</a> IPC

         308 Attempt to commit culpable homicide - Whoever does
         any act with such intention or knowledge and under such
         circumstances that, if he by that act caused death, he would be
         guilty of culpable homicide not amounting to murder, shall be
         punished with imprisonment of either description for a term
         which may extend to three years, or with fine, or with both.
</blockquote>


<p id="p_23">  So long as the question of common intention is concerned, the

  Sec.34 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_13">IPC</a> is also re-produced for the sake of convenience. The

  same is also as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">         Sec.34 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_14">IPC</a>:-
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">         " When a criminal act is done by several persons in furtherance
          of the common intention of all, each of such persons is liable
          for that act in the same manner as if it were done by him
          alone."
</blockquote>


<p id="p_24">  Careful perusal of the <a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_15">section 34</a> IPC reveals the following

  important ingredients :
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">         i. That there must be a criminal act.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_6">         ii. The act must have been done by several persons in
             furtherance of their common intention.
</blockquote>


<p id="p_25">13.On perusal of all depositions of the prosecution witnesses and

  their cross-examinations, I have found so many minor type of

  contradictions and discrepancies in their statements which are
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                                   17</span>

attributable due to the long duration of time and memory of

human being.       However, in case of Jaskaran Singh Vs State

1997 SCC (Crl) 651 it was observed by Hon'ble Supreme Court

in the following words:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_7">       " When the evidence of first informant is found to be full of
        contradictions, exaggerations and improvements, he cannot
        be held to be a truthful witness" .
</blockquote>

<p id="p_26">Giving support to the contentions of minor contradictions Hon'ble

Supreme Court in case State of UP Vs Bhagwan AIR 1997 SC

3292: (1997) 1 SCC 19 made the following observations which

are very relevant crucial and dominant in deciding the fate of the

present case:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_8">       "minor discrepancies in the evidence of the eye-witnesses
       are immaterial unless they demolished the basic case of the
       prosecution" .
</blockquote>

<p id="p_27">The    observations made in the aforesaid two cases by the

Hon'ble Supreme Court are ex facie indicative of the fact that a

clear distinction be made between the major contradictions and

minor contradictions when the contradictions are minor the

truthfulness of the witness cannot be discredited in all and

contrary to it when the contradictions are major these affect the

root of the case and leave an impression of untruthfulness of the

witnesses.

</p><p id="p_29">14.Therefore, keeping in view of the above discussed facts and

  circumstances of the case and law and facts, I am of the view

  that prosecution has successfully proved its case against all the

  accused persons namely accused Akbar and Aftab beyond

  reasonable doubt as it has specifically come and proved on

  record that they gave beatings to the injured victim Sabir with

  their common intention. Role of every accused persons with

  regard to causing head injuries to the victim Sabir is crystal and

  clear that on 15th August 2004 victim Sabir was going inside of

  his house after lifting a kite, accused Afaq, who was the father

  of the other two accused persons (now deceased) caught hold

  the victim. Accused Akbar gave him leg and fist blows while

  other accused Aftab gave a blow with brick on the head of victim

  Sabir as a result of which he sustained injuries on his head.

  Further, PW1 Dr. Davender, CMO GTB Hospital has got the

  MLC of victim as Ex.PW1/A which was prepared by Dr. Rajeev

  Shekhar. It has been proved that as per the MLC of injured, on

  local examination, a lacerated wound on saggital suture of the

  size of 3 x 0.5 cm was found. He further proved that the patient

  was complaining of chest pain and his Vitals were found normal

  and no abnormality was deducted and the patient was fit for

  statement and blunt weapon of offence was suspected to have
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                              19</span>

been used and injuries were under observation. All the material

witnesses have specifically identified them and proved their role

in the incident. There is no dispute with regard to the identity of

accused persons. All the material documents have also been

proved by the witnesses.      The primary facts of this case has

been ascertained by this court as it is on record that injuries with

fist blow and brick were caused to the victim i.e. Sabir which is

proved from the statement of victim himself and statement of

PW1 Dr. Devender, CMO, GTB Hospital. It is also on record that

causing injury with the brick on the head sufficiently import the

element of knowledge which goes to suggest that if accused by

that act caused death they would have been culprit to culpable

homicide not amounting to murder. Since the injury was caused

with the brick on the vital part i.e. head of victim and sufficient

blood was oozing out from the head of victim, on the

determination of this fact, the element of knowledge can be

inferred for attracting <a href="/doc/4266/" id="a_16">section 308</a> IPC for the conviction of the

accused persons. It is also on record that the magnitude of the

lacerated wound in the size 3 x 0.5 cm was also found by PW1

Dr. in his testimony. This factum also goes to establish import of

knowledge u/s 308 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_17">IPC</a> attempt to commit culpable homicide not

amounting to murder. So long as element of common intention
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">                               20</span>

  is concerned, I am of the view that all the three persons namely

  Afaq, Aftab and Akbar were father and sons and they caused

  injuries with their common intention on the head of victim Sabir.

  However, during the course of trial father of other two accused

  Afaq has expired during the course of trial and proceedings

  against him have already been directed to be abated.

  Accordingly, prosecution has proved its case for the offence u/s

  308/34 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_18">IPC</a> beyond reasonable doubt against the accused

  persons. Accordingly, they are convicted for the offence under

  <a href="/doc/4266/" id="a_19">section 308</a>/<a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_20">34</a> IPC.
