    method was not followed. It is argued that finding of guilt of accused no. 1

</p><p id="p_33">    17.The PFA Act and PFA Rules lay down in detail the procedure to be followed 

    by FI at the time of and after the sample is collected by him. As per <a href="/doc/70055577/" id="a_6">Section 11</a> 

</p><p id="p_34">    (i)(b) of PFA Act, the Food Inspector is obliged to divide the sample into three 

    parts   and   than   the   sample   is   packed,   fastened   and   sealed   in   a   manner 

    prescribed by the Act and Rules. As per Sec. 11(c)(i) &amp; (ii), the Food Inspector 

    has to send one of the parts of sample for the analysis to the Public Analyst 

    and   the   remaining   two   parts   to   the   Local   Health   Authority.   <a href="/doc/56546430/" id="a_7">Section   13(2)</a> 

    authorises   a   person   from   whom   sample   is   taken   to   get   the   other   sample 

    counter part to be examined by the CFL, if he is not satisfied with the report of 

    Public Analyst. The purpose of dividing the sample into three counter parts is 

    to make available another counter part for examination by the Director CFL in 

    case,   the   accused   opts   to   get   the   second   counter   part   examined   by   the 

    Director, CFL. Thus, the PFA Act and Rules thereunder have introduced the 

    system of check and counter check to the process of collection and analysis of 

    sample under the PFA Act. However, if, the three samples are not of uniform 

    nature/ quality, than, the entire purpose of introducing checks and balances is 

    defeated.

    29.03.1979, it had been observed that it is of utmost importance to ensure that 

    the   three   samples   are   of   uniform   quality.   Otherwise,   value   of   check   and

     counter check is completely lost. Therefore, if the sample was not uniform and 

    representative in nature, it would not be safe to convict the petitioner.


</p><p id="p_37">    19.In the present case, according to the Public Analyst Report, the sample was 

    received in unsealed plastic container without any label. However, the Director, 

    CFL received it in a plastic box containing yellow printing label. All the PWs 

    deposed  that sealed plastic container  having  identical  label declaration  was 

    lifted from the premises of accused no. 1. This shows that either the process 

    for collecting of sample was not meticulously followed or the sample lifted were 

    not identical. In view of completely different description of sample in the Public 

    Analyst Report and the report of Director, CFL, there is total violation of Rule 

    22 (A) of the PFA Rules which allows contents of sealed containers having 

    identical label declaration to constitute part of sample.

    the variation in report of Public Analyst and Director CFL, it is in no doubt that 

    there is a settled law that once the appellant exercise the right U/Sec. 13 (2) of 

    the Act, the report of the Director, CFL stands completely wiped out by the 

    certificate of the Director, CFL, however, the accused can still show that in the 

    facts of the given case and of concrete objective grounds that the sample 

    sent to the Director, CFL, was not a representative sample.  In the case of

                  (5) of <a href="/doc/128134290/" id="a_8">Section 13</a>  of  the  Act, the  certificate  is the final  and  
                  conclusive   evidence   of   the   facts   stated   therein.   The  
                  presumption attaching to the certificate again is only in regard  
                  to what is stated in it as to the contents of the sample actually  
                  examined by the Director and nothing more. Even after this  
                  certificate, it is open to the accused to show that in the facts  
                  of a given case and on the concrete objective grounds that he  
                  may prove on the record the sample sent for analysis to the  
                  Director could not be taken to be a representative sample of  
                  the   article   of   food   from   which   it   was   taken   and   if   this  
                  contention   is   found   to   be   correct,   conviction   based   on   the  
                  certificate will not be sustainable. Reference on this aspect of  
                  the question may be made to the observations of the Division

                 finding on an analysis or test of the constituents in the sample  
                 sent, their proportions, etc. The analyst has merely to give his  
                 opinion as to whether the article which he analysed has an  
                 excess or deficiency in constituents. The vendor would still be

                 time   or   delay   in   making   its   analysis   the   vendor   can   do   so

      This proposition finds strength from the following judgments ;


A)        D.L. Chatterjee Vs. Kailashpati Oil Mill and others 2003 (2) FAC 240 the 

          Hon.  Apex Court set aside the order of the High Court which had quashed

          trial despite the fact that there was variation in the "contents and extent of 

          adulteration of the food articles" in the report of the Director and the PA.


B)        The  Division Bench  of Hon'ble High Court of Delhi  in  MCD  Vs.   M/s

        would be with respect to the result of the analysis by the Director and the  
        findings reached therein regarding relevant ingredients of the part of the  
        sample sent for analysis and analysed by the Director of the Central Food  
        Laboratory.    Once   this   type   of   conclusive   evidence   emerges   on   record,  
        whatever   might   have   been   contra­indicated   regarding   the   concerned  
        ingredients of the sample as found in the prior report of the public analyst  
        would be totally pushed out of the arena of contest and cannot be looked at.  
        If that is so,  there would be no question of considering any variance  
        between the results of the tests carried out by the public analyst on  
        the one hand and the Director of the Central Food Laboratory on the  
        other   vis­a­vis   two   parts   of   the   sample   sample.   Any   variation   or  
        variance   between   the   different   ingredients   mentioned   in   these   two  
        reports would presuppose comparison between two existing reports  
        on record.  But if one of the reports is wholly pushed out of record as  
        enjoined   by  <a href="/doc/111740125/" id="a_15"> S.   13(3)</a>   read   with  <a href="/doc/180182871/" id="a_16"> S.   13(5)</a>,   there   is   no   question   of  
        resorting to the exercise of comparison between the contents of these  
        two reports with a view to finding out the supposed variance between  
        the existing and operative report of the Director and earlier report of  
        the public analyst which has ceased to exist on record.".

        to   countenance   the   submission   of   the   accused   that   despite   these  

        provisions, non­existing report of the public anlayst can still be looked at for  

        the purpose of finding out the alleged variance between the contents of that

        of   the   Public  Analyst  is  superseded   by  the   report  of   the   Director   of  the

        conclude that there are divergences and therefrom draw an inference that  
        the   sampling   must   have   been   done   improperly.    To   arrive   at   such   a  
        conclusion would amount to flying in the face of settled position of the law
