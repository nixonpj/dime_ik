ACT:
    Criminal  Trial--Criminal charge must be  brought  home-
Proved	beyond	all reasonable doubt-abetment  separate	 and
distinct offence--Letting guilty escape is not doing justice
according to law.



HEADNOTE:
    Ravinder  Kaur, daughter of Gurbachan Singh was  married
to  Satpal Singh in November, 1962. She died on	 25th  June,
1983  at about 2.30 P.M. It was alleged, she committed	sui-
cide  because of the harassment, constant taunts  and  cruel
behaviour  of her in-laws towards her and persistent  demand
for  dowry and insinnuations that she was carrying an  ille-
gitimate  child.  It is alleged, provoked by  the  aforesaid
conduct and behaviour she committed suicide. The  father-in-
law, mother-in-law and the husband of the deceased have been
the abetters of the crime and the deceased died of second to
third degree burns.
    The learned Additional Sessions Judge on the totality of
evidence  on  record held that the accused  were  guilty  of
abetment to suicide and as such punishable under <a href="/doc/92983/" id="a_1">Section 306</a>
of the I.P.C. On appeal by the accused the High Court was of
the  view that the guilt of the accused had not been  proved
and as such acquitted them.
    The complainant and father of the deceased aggrieved  by
the  order of the High Court preferred these appeals by	 way
of  special  leave to appeal. This Court  holding  that	 the
order of acquittal made by the High Court is not sustainable
and  affirming the conviction of the accused  under  <a href="/doc/92983/" id="a_2">section
306</a>  of	 I.P.C. and the sentence imposed by  the  Additional
Sessions Judge, Amritsar,
    HELD: (Per Sabyasachi Mukharji J. ) Abetment is a  sepa-
rate  and distinct offence provided the thing abetted is  an
offence. Abetment does not involve the actual commission  of
the crime abetted; it is a crime apart. [295G]
    Criminal charges must be brought home and proved  beyond
all  reasonable	 doubts. While civil case may be  proved  by
mere preponderance of evidence, in criminal cases the prose-
cution must prove the
293
charge	beyond reasonable doubt. There must not be any	're-
asonable  doubt' of the guilt of the accused in	 respect  of
the particular offence charged. The courts must strictly  be
satisfied  that no innocent person-innocent in the sense  of
not  being guilty of the offence of which he is	 charged--is
convicted.  even at the risk of letting of some guilty	per-
sons.  Even after the introduction of<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_3"> S. 493A</a> of the  I.P.C.
and <a href="/doc/294349/" id="a_4"> S. 113A</a> of the Indian Evidence Act, the proof  must  be
beyond	any  shadow of reasonable doubt. There is  a  higher
standard of proof in criminal cases than in civil cases, but
there  is  no  absolute standard in  either  of	 the  cases.
[296C-F]
    The	 standard adopted must be the standard adopted by  a
prudent	 man which, of course, may vary from case  to  case,
circumstances to circumstances. Exaggerated devotion to	 the
rule of benefit of doubt must not nurture fanciful doubts of
lingering  suspicions  and thereby destroy  social  defence.
Justice cannot be made sterile on the plea that it is better
to  let hundred guilty escape than punish an innocent.	Let-
ting  guilty escape is not doing justice, according to	law.
[296F]
    (Per  B.C. Ray, J): Circumstantial evidence as  well  as
the prosecution witnesses in the instant case clearly  prove
beyond doubt that the accused instigated and abetted Ravind-
er  Kaur, deceased in the commission of the offence by	com-
mitting suicide by burning herself. [306G]
    The findings arrived at by the Trial Court after consid-
ering  and weighing the entire evidences are  unexceptional.
The findings arrived at by the High Court without  consider-
ing  properly  the circumstantial evidence as  well  as	 the
evidences of the prosecution witnesses cannot be  sustained.
As  such  the findings of the High Court are  liable  to  be
reversed and set aside. [306H; 307A]
    The	 suicide  having been committed within a  period  of
seven years from the date of her marriage in accordance with
the provisions of <a href="/doc/138097064/" id="a_5">Section 113A</a> the Court may presume  having
regard to all the other circumstances of the case that	such
suicide	 had been abetted by the husband and his  relations.
Therefore,  the findings arrived at by the  Additional	Ses-
sions  Judge are quite in accordance with the provisions  of
this  section  and the findings of the High Court  that	 the
accused	 persons  could not be held to	have  instigated  or
abetted	 the  commission of offence, is not  sustainable  in
law. [308C-D]
    <a href="/doc/294349/" id="a_6">Section 113A</a> of the Indian Evidence Act was inserted  in
the Statute Book by Act 46 of 1983 whereas the offence under

The following Judgments of the Court were delivered
    SABYASACHI	MUKHARJI,  J.  Ravinder	 Kaur,	daughter  of
Gurbachan Singh, resident of Amritsar, was married to Satpal
Singh  in  November, 1982. She died on 25th  June,  1983  at
about  2.30  p.m.  She, it was	alleged,  committed  suicide
because of the cruel behaviour of her in-laws soon after her
marriage.  She used to visit her parents' at Amritsar  occa-
sionally and during those visits she used to tell them	that
there  was demand for dowry and also taunting of her by	 the
members	 of the family of her in-laws and  also	 insinuation
that  she  was	carrying on illegitimate  child.  There	 are
sufficient, relevant and acceptable evidence to that effect.
It  is	alleged that provoked by the aforesaid	conduct	 and
behaviour-, she committed suicide. The father-in-law,  moth-
er-in-law  and	the  husband of the accused  have  been	 the
abettors to the crime. The evidence further established that
she  died of second to third degree burns on the  body,	 and
there was sprawling of kerosene oil on her body and the body
was  burnt by fire. Accused no. 3--Smt. Kamal Dip Kaur,	 the
mother-in-law of the deceased and the mother of the  accused
Satpal Singh, stated in her statement under<a href="/doc/47577/" id="a_14"> s. 3</a> <a href="/doc/1889786/" id="a_15">13</a> Cr. P.C.
that  she  was lying in her house at that time and  the	 de-
ceased was
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">295</span>
cooking	 food on a kerosene stove, and as such the  deceased
caught fire accidentally.
</p><p id="p_5">    Learned Addl. Sessions Judge held that there was absence
of burn injuries on the fingertips of the mother-in-law	 and
other  members of the family. As mentioned before,  the	 de-
ceased	was married in November, 1982. After  marriage,	 she
used to stay in the house of her-in-laws at Raja Sansi.	 The
deceased used to visit the house of her parents at  Amritsar
occasionally, as noted before. During these visits she	used
to tell them that her-in-laws were not happy with the  dowry
given  to  the latter. It is further on	 evidence..that	 she
complained  that her in-laws used to taunt her and  insisted
her  tO bring more dowry. It is stated that  she  complained
that  the in-laws taunted her that at the time of  the	mar-
riage, her parents did not serve proper meals to the in-laws
and their guests. It is further stated that the accused used
to  tell  her that they had been offered by fridge  etc.  by
other parties for the marriage of the accused while she	 had
not  brought dowry expected from her parents. It is also  on
evidence that she was often openly threatened that she would
be  turned out of the house in case she did not	 bring	more
articles.  These  were all established by  the	evidence  of
Gurbachan  Singh, father of the deceased and his two  daugh-
ters.  It was insinuated of her by the accused that she	 was
carrying an illegitimate child.
</p><p id="p_6">    On the totality of these evidence on record, it was held
by  the learned Sessions Judge that the accused were  guilty
of  abetment to suicide and as such punishable under<a href="/doc/92983/" id="a_16"> s.	 306</a>
of the I.P.C. The High Court on appeal was of the view	that
the  guilt of the accused had not been proved, and  as	such
acquitted them.
</p><p id="p_7">    The	 first thing that is necessary for proving  the	 of-
fence  is  the fact of suicide. Abetment is a  separate	 and
distinct  offence provided the thing abetted is an  offence.
Abetment does not involve the actual commission of the crime
abetted; it is a crime apart. See the observations of Baren-
dra Kumar Ghosh, 52 ILR Cal. 197. It was contended on behalf
of the accused that there was no direct evidence of the	 act
of suicide by Ravinder Kaur. There, indeed, could not be  in
the circumstances in which she died. She was in the house of
her in-laws. There is ample and sufficient evidence that she
had  complained	 that she was taunted  for  bringing  meager
dowry  and  that even insinuated that she was  carrying	 'an
illegitimate  child'. The aforesaid facts stand	 established
by cogent and reliable evidence. These are grave and serious
provocation  enough for an ordinary woman in the Indian	 set
up, to do
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">296</span>
what  the  deceased is alleged.to have done. There  is	also
evidence  that the persons in the house of her	in-laws	 in-
cluding	 the  mother-in-law-mother  of	the  accused  Satpal
Singh,	made no attempt to save her from the burn  injuries.
The  absence of any burn injury in the hands of	 the  people
around, indicates and establishes that there was no  attempt
to  save the deceased though she was seen being	 burnt.	 The
evidence  of  attitude	and  conduct  of  the	in-laws--the
father-in-law, mother-in-law and the husband after  Ravinder
Kaur,  the deceased, got burns in not informing the  parents
and  not  taking prompt steps to take her  to  hospital	 for
giving	medical	 assistance corroborate the  inference	that
these  accused	connived  and abetted  the  crime.  Criminal
charges must be brought home and proved beyond all  reasona-
ble doubt. While civil case may be proved by mere preponder-
ance  of  evidence, in criminal cases the  prosecution	must
prove  the  charge beyond reasonable doubt. See	 Mancini  v.
Director of Public Prosecutions, [1942] AC 1, Woolmington v.
The  Director of Public Prosecutions, [1935] AC 462.  It  is
true even today, as much as it was before. There must not be
any  'reasonable  doubt' about the guilt of the	 accused  in
respect	 of the particular offence charged. The courts	must
strictly  be satisfied that no innocent person, innocent  in
the sense of not being guilty of the offence of which he  is
charged,  is convicted, even at the risk of letting of	some
guilty	persons. Even after the introduction of<a href="/doc/538436/" id="a_17"> s.  498A</a>  of
the I.P.C. and<a href="/doc/294349/" id="a_18"> s. 113A</a> of the Indian Evidence Act, the proof
must  be beyond any shadow of reasonable doubt. There  is  a
higher	standard  of proof in criminal cases than  in  civil
cases,	but there is no absolute standard in either  of	 the
cases.	See  the observations of Lord Denning  in  Bater  v.
Bater,	[1950] 2 AER 458 at 459 but the doubt must be  of  a
reasonable  man. The standard adopted must be  the  standard
adopted	 by  a prudent man which, of course, may  vary	from
case  to case, circumstances to	 circumstances.	 Exaggerated
devotion  to the rule of benefit of doubt must	not  nurture
fancilful doubts or lingering suspicions and thereby destroy
social	defence. Justice cannot be made sterile on the	plea
that  it is better to let hundred guilty escape than  punish
an  innocent.  Letting guilty escape is not  doing  justice,
according to law.
</p><p id="p_8">    The	 conscience of the court can never be bound  by	 any
rule  but that is coming itself dictates  the  consciousness
and  prudent exercise of the judgment. Reasonable  doubt  is
simply that degree of doubt which would permit a  reasonable
and just man to come to a conclusion. Reasonableness of	 the
doubt must be commensurate with the nature of the offence to
be investigated.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">297</span>
<p id="p_9">    Having regard to the circumstances of the case, there is
no direct evidence indicating the circumstances in which the
death took place, the conduct of the accused and the  nature
of  the	 crime	with which the accused	was  charged,  there
cannot be any scope of doubt that the learned Sessions Judge
was right and the conviction was properly made. This is	 not
a case where there could be two views possible on the  facts
found  and  on the facts which could not possibly  be  found
because	 of  i,the nature of the offence. The fact  the	 two
view are reasonably possible, is not established by the fact
that two different conclusions are reached by two  adjudica-
tory authorities. The factum of that may be only a piece  of
evidence, but whether two views at all are possible or	not,
has  to be judged in all circumstances by the Judge, by	 the
logic  of the facts found in the background of law. For	 the
reasons	 aforesaid, I respectfully agree with  the  judgment
and order proposed by my learned brother.
</p><p id="p_10">RAY, J. Special leave granted.
</p><p id="p_11">    These  appeals are at the instance of  Gurbachan  Singh,
the  complainant  against the judgment and order  passed  in
Criminal  Appeal  No. 434 SB of 1984 by the  High  Court  of
Punjab	&amp; Haryana at Chandigarh acquitting  the	 accused-re-
spondents  of  the charge under<a href="/doc/92983/" id="a_19"> s. 306</a> of the  Indian  Penal
Code on setting aside the conviction and sentence passed  by
the  Additional Session Judge on August 9,  1984  convicting
and  sentencing all the accused. The appeal was	 allowed  on
holding	 that there was no evidence on record that  the	 ac-
cused at the time of commission of suicide by Ravinder Kant,
in  any way instigated or abetted her to commit suicide	 and
as  such  the  prosecution failed to  establish	 the  charge
against	 the accused and their conviction  consequently	 can
not be sustained.
</p><p id="p_12">    The	 prosecution  case is that  the	 deceased,  Ravinder
Kaur,  daughter	 of  Gurbachan Singh,  the  complainant	 was
married	 to Satpal Singh in November, 1982. After  marriage,
Ravinder Kaur started living in the house of her in-laws  at
Raja  Sansi. She used to visit the house of her	 parents  at
Amritsar  occasionally and during these visits, she used  to
tell  them  that her in-laws were not happy with  the  dowry
given to her and they used to taunt her and insisted her  to
bring  more dowry and that they even used to taunt her	that
her  parents at the time of the marriage did not serve	them
with  proper meals. The accused also used to tell  her	that
they were being offered Fridge etc. by the other parties  in
the  marriage of Accused Satpal Singh and that she  has	 not
brought	 the dowry expected from her parents. She was  often
told
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">298</span>
by  them that she would be turned out of the house, in	case
she did not bring more articles.
</p><p id="p_13">    In November, 1982, Gurbachan Singh visited the house  of
her in-laws at Raja Sansi where his daughter complained that
the behaviour of her in-laws towards her was not cordial and
that  they  were maltreating her for  bringing	insufficient
dowry  and  they even taunted her that she was	carrying  an
illegitimate child. Hearing these complaints from her daugh-
ter,  Gurbachan Singh brought her daughter to his  house  at
Amritsar,  one day prior to Baisakhi, 1983 and his  daughter
continued  to  remain  at his house for	 about	eight  days.
There-.	 after	Satpal Singh, his  father  Harbhajan  Singh,
accused	 and  his  mother Smt. Kanwal Dip  Kaur	 along	with
Harjit Singh, and Mohinder Singh, maternal uncles of  Satpal
Singh  came to the house of Gurbachan Singh at Amritsar	 and
pursuaded that he should send Ravinder kaur with them where-
upon Gurbachan Singh told them that his daughter  complained
against	 the ill-treatment and cruel behaviour	towards	 her
for  bringing insufficient dowry and they also	taunted	 her
for  this  as  well as for her illegitimate  child  and	 put
pressure on her to bring more dowry. So he was reluctant  to
send  her  daughter  back to her  in-laws.  Gurbachan  Singh
called Ved Prakash, President of the Mohalla Committee, Smt.
Raj  Kumari, a social worker living in the neighbourhood  of
Gurbachan  Singh and one Ramesh Kumar to his house  and	 all
these complaints and grievances were repeated in presence of
these  persons. The accused assured him that in future	they
would  not  maltreat  and taunt her and that  he  would	 not
receive	 any complaint against them. They also	assured	 him
that  in future they would not ask her to bring more  dowry.
On these assurances of the accused, Gurbachan Singh sent his
daughter  with the accused to Raja Sansi, the house  of	 the
accused.
</p><p id="p_14">    For	 about two months, Gurbachan Singh did	not  receive
any  information  from his daughter and so he sent  his	 two
daughters Surjit Kaur and Sajinder Kaur to Raja Sansi to the
house  of the in:laws of Ravinder Kaur to enquire about	 her
welfare.  The said daughters of Gurbachan Singh went to	 the
house of the in-laws of Ravinder Kaur on June 23, 1983	that
is,  two days prior to the death of Ravinder Kaur.  The	 de-
ceased complained to them about the torture as well as cruel
behaviour  of  her  in-laws, as before	and  they  have	 not
stopped	 maltreating her and torturing her and she  was	 not
happy  there. On June 25, 1983 at about 6.30 p.m.,  Mohinder
Singh,	maternal uncle of Satpal Singh came to the  shop  of
Gurbachan Singh at Amritsar and informed him that his daugh-
ter committed suicide by sprinkling
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">299</span>
kerosene  oil on her body and then setting herself  on	fire
and  that  she was  lying at S.G.T.B.	Hospital,  Amritsar.
Gurbachan  Singh immediately went to the hospital and  found
the  dead body of her daughter lying in the dead  house.  It
has  been  alleged that Ravinder Kaur committed	 suicide  on
June  25,  1983 at 2.30 p.m. having fed up  with  the  cruel
behaviour  of her in-laws. The appellant alongwith the	mem-
bers of his family stayed in the hospital. On June 26, 1983,
Gurmeet	 Singh,	 A.S.I. Police Station, Ajnala came  to	 the
dead house at Amritsar at about 5 p.m. and examined the dead
body of Ravinder Kaur. He recorded the statements of  Gurba-
chan Singh, Ved Prakash and Ramesh Kumar.
</p><p id="p_15">    The	 statement of Gurbachan Singh was reproduced in	 the
Roznamcha,  and	 the statements of Gurbachan Singh  and	 Ved
Prakash,  President  of	 the Mohalla  Sudhar  Committee	 and
Ramesh Kumar though disclosed the commission of a cognizable
offence	 by  the accused yet Gurmit Singn, A.S.I.  and	even
Shri Iqbal Singh Dhillon, D.S.P., Ajnala Police Station	 did
not register the case for extraneous reasons.
    On June 27, 1983, Dr. Gurdip Kumar Uppal, Medical  Offi-
cer,  Police  Hospital, Amritsar conducted the	post  mortem
examination on the dead body of Ravinder Kaur and found	 2nd
to third degree burns on the body of deceased.
    Gurbachan Singh alongwith his daughters and Raj  Kumari,
Ramesh Kumar, Ved Prakash and others met the S.S.P. Amritsar
in  this regard and the investigation of the case  was	then
entrusted  by S.S.P. to Shri Surjit Singh, S.P. (Head  Quar-
ters)  Amritsar who summoned Gurbachan Singh and other	per-
sons and recorded their statements on July 23, 1983.
    All the three accused were charged for an offence  under
s. 306<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_20"> of the Indian Penal Code</a> and they pleaded not  guilty
to  the charge framed against them. The accused no.  3	Smt.
Kanwal	Dip  Kaur, the mother of the accused,  Satpal  Singh
stated	in her statement under<a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_21"> s. 313</a> Cr. P.C. that she	 was
lying in her house at the time and the deceased was  cooking
food in the kitchen on a kerosene stove and she caught	fire
accidentally.
</p><p id="p_16">    The	 learned  Additional Sessions Judge  held  that	 the
absence	  of  burn  injuries  on  the  fingertips   of	 the
mother-in-law or other members of the family as evident from
the statement of D.W. 1, Jaswant Singh,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">300</span>
ruled  out  the story of accidental fire as set	 up  by	 the
defence.  He further held referring to the provisions of <a href="/doc/294349/" id="a_22"> s.
113A</a> of the Evidence Act that having regard to the facts and
circumstances  of the case it may be presumed that  the	 ac-
cused  persons	have abetted the suicide  committed  by	 the
deceased  and they fail to reverse this prosecution case  by
any  evidence. Accordingly, the Additional  Sessions  Judge,
Amritsar  convicted  the accused under<a href="/doc/92983/" id="a_23"> s. 306</a> IPC  and	sen-
tenced	them to suffer rigorous imprisonment for five  years
each  and  to  pay a fine of Rs.2,000 each,  in	 default  of
payment	 of  fine  the accused shall be	 further  liable  to
rigorous imprisonment for four months.
</p><p id="p_17">    The accused-respondents preferred an appeal being Crimi-
nal  Appeal No. 454 of 1984 in the High Court of Punjab	 and
Haryana.  The  appeal  was allowed and	the  conviction	 and
sentence  was set aside on the ground that  the	 prosecution
failed to establish the charge against the accused  persons.
Hence  this  appeal by special leave has been filed  by	 the
complainant.
</p><p id="p_18">    It	has been contended by the learned counsel  appearing
on  behalf of the appellant that the cruel  behaviour,	mal-
treatment and taunts for not bringing sufficient dowry	have
been  made  to the deceased, Ravinder Kaur, soon  after	 her
coming	to the house of her in-laws. It has also been  urged
that  in November, 1982 she complained of her in-laws'	iII-
treatment  and taunts to his father and her father took	 her
to his house. It has also been urged that the accused Satpal
Singh  and  his	 father accused Harbhajan  Singh  and  other
relatives  of  the accused met the deceased  father  at	 his
house and requested him to send his daughter to the house of
her  in-laws and assured them that they would  not  maltreat
her or taunt her or torture her for not bringing  sufficient
dowry.	These assurances were given in the presence  of	 Ved
Prakash, the President of the Mohalla Sudhar Committee,	 and
Raj Kumari, a social worker and one Ramesh Kumar.  Gurbachan
Singh,	father of the deceased on these assurances given  by
the accused and their relations sent his daughter,  Ravinder
Kuar  to her in laws house. It has also been urged  that  on
June  23,  1983 the two daughters Surjit Kaur  and  Sujinder
Kaur  were sent by Gurbachan Singh to the house of  the	 in-
laws  of Ravinder Kaur to enquire about her welfare.  Surjit
Kaur,  PW-7  stated in her statement under<a href="/doc/447673/" id="a_24"> s. 161</a>  Cr.	P.C.
that her sister Ravinder Kaur complained them about the same
iII-treatment  by her husband continuing in the same  manner
as  before and as such she was not happy. This was  reported
by them to their father at Amritsar. It has also been  urged
that  all the three accused taunted the	 deceased,  Ravinder
Kaur that she was carrying an illegitimate child. Being
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">301</span>
depressed  with these taunts and iII-treatment the  deceased
committed  suicide by sprinkling kerosene on her person	 and
setting her to fire. The evidences of PW-4 Gurbachan  Singh,
father of the deceased and the evidence of PW-7 Surjeet Kaur
as well as evidence of PW-6 Raj Kumari were duly  considered
by  the	 trial court and the trial court clearly  found	 the
accused	 persons guilty of the offence of abetting the	sui-
cide  committed by the deceased. The court of  appeal  below
had  wrongly  found  that the prosecution  could  not  prove
charge	against the accused and set aside the order of	con-
viction	 and sentence made by the trial court and  acquitted
the  accused. It has been urged in this connection that	 the
defence	 that  it was a case of accidental fire and  not  of
suicide	 was  also not believed by the trial court  and	 the
trial  court gave very cogent and plausible reasons for	 not
believing  this	 story	and holding that it was	 a  case  of
suicide	 committed  by	the deceased Ravinder  Kaur  by	 the
taunts and ill-treatment made to her by her in laws and this
forced	her  to take her own life by suicide.  It  has	been
submitted  that the accused have abetted the  commission  of
suicide	 by  Ravinder Kaur, deceased and  the  accused	are,
therefore, guilty of the said charge. The order of acquittal
made  by the High Court is not sustainable in these  circum-
stances.
</p><p id="p_19">    The learned counsel, Mr. R.C. Kohli has made three	fold
submissions before this Court. The first submission is	that
the case of suicide committed by the deceased Ravinder	Kaur
was  not proved and as such the conviction on the charge  of
s.  306 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_25">I.P.C</a>. as made by the trial court was  not  sustain-
able. He has further submitted that the prosecution has	 not
proved beyond reasonable doubts that the deceased  committed
suicide.  The  next submission made is	that  the  evidences
produced on behalf of the prosecution are meagre and do	 not
prove that the accused had abetted the commission of suicide
by the deceased Ravinder Kaur. The prosecution did not prove
that  there  was  any instigation  by  the  accused  persons
charged	 with the offence in this case. The High  Court	 has
rightly held that the prosecution failed to prove the ingre-
dients of<a href="/doc/92983/" id="a_26"> s. 306</a> of the IPC and acquitted the accused of the
charge	under<a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_27"> s. 306</a>. This order of acquittal should not  be
interfered  with by this Court in this appeal. It  has	been
lastly contended that if two reasonable views could be taken
of  evidences,	one in favour of the accused and  the  other
against	 them  the appellate court should not  interfere  in
such case and set aside the order of acquittal.
    As regards the first submission that the case of suicide
has  not been proved, it is relevant to mention that in	 the
FIR (Ex. PF) lodged by the complainant it has been  specifi-
cally stated that due to constant
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">302</span>
harassment  of	Ravinder  Kaur by the  accused	persons	 for
having brought less dowry in her marriage as well as due  to
constant  taunts  and also torture, the	 deceased  committed
suicide by pouring kerosene oil on her and burnt herself and
afterwards  she died. It has been further stated in the	 FIR
that the complainant apprehended that some quarrel must have
happened  on the day of the incident between  his  daughter,
Ravinder  Kaur and her husband Satpal  Singh,  father-in-law
Harbhajan Singh and mother-in-law Kanwaldip Kaur before	 she
took  the  extreme step. P.W. 4, Gurbachan  Singh  has	also
stated in his deposition that his daughter used to tell them
that  her  husband, father-in-law and  mother-in-law  always
taunted her saying that her parents had not given sufficient
dowry during the marriage and had not even served them	with
proper meals at the time of marriage. He further stated that
on  25th  June, 1983 at 6.30 p.m. Mohinder  Singh,  maternal
uncle  of  Satpal Singh came to shop and told him  that	 his
daughter had committed suicide by sprinkling kerosene oil on
her  body  and then setting her on fire.  In  his  statement
under  <a href="/doc/357596/" id="a_28">Section 161</a>, Cr. P.C. recorded on 23rd July, 1983  he
also stated that her two daughters namely Sajinder Kaur	 and
Surjeet	 Kaur (P.W. 7) who visited Raja Sansi to meet  their
sister, Ravinder Kaur two days before the incident were told
by her deceased daughter that her in-laws often taunted	 her
for  not bringing sufficient dowry. It has also been  stated
by him that the accused taunted her daughter saying that she
was  carrying an illegal child which is a great	 defame	 for
them. It has also been stated that "due to the bad treatment
meted out towards his daughter Ravinder Kaur at the hands of
her husband, Satpal Singh, her mother-inlaw, Kanwaldip	Kaur
and  her  father-in-law, Harbhajan Singh that  she  had	 not
brought scooter and fridge and had brought less dowry in her
marriage they had forced her to put kerosene oil on her body
and commit suicide and as they often taunted her saying that
she had begotten immoral and illegal pregnancy and for	this
reason	she  had  committed suicide and thus  had  lost	 her
life."
</p><p id="p_20">    Furthermore, though the house of the accused persons  is
not  far  off  yet  the information was	 given	not  by	 his
son-in-law  or other members of the family promptly  but  it
was  given by the maternal uncle of the	 son-in-law,  Satpal
Singh  at 6.30 p.m. to the appellant although  the  incident
occurred  at  about 2.30 p.m. It is also  evident  that	 the
deceased, Ravinder Kaur who had second to third degree burns
on her person was brought to the hospital in the evening and
the  doctor,  P.W. I immediately examined her  and  declared
that  she was already dead. Another most pertinent  question
which  has been decided by the Trial Court is that  the	 de-
fence story as stated by her mother-in-law,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">303</span>
Kanwaldip  Kaur	 in her examination under <a href="/doc/47577/" id="a_29">section 3</a>  <a href="/doc/1889786/" id="a_30">13</a>	 Cr.
P.C. that it was a case of accidental fire and not a case of
suicide,  was falsified by the absence of burn	injuries  on
the finger tips of the mother-in-law or other members of the
family.	 The  Trial Court rightly held "that  the  intending
circumstances show that she was not allowed to move till the
process	 of  burning had become irrecoverable and  till	 she
succumbed to her injuries."
</p><p id="p_21">    We do not find any infirmity in this finding and we also
hold  on consideration and appraisement of the evidences  as
well  as the circumstances set out hereinbefore that it	 was
not a case of accidental fire but a case of suicide  commit-
ted  by the deceased Ravinder Kaur being constantly  abused,
taunted	 for bringing less dowry and also being defamed	 for
carrying  an illegitimate child. It is pertinent to  mention
that in the appeal before the High Court it was not urged on
behalf	of  the	 accused that the case of  suicide  was	 not
proved and as such there was no finding by the High Court on
this  score. In such circumstances this argument is  totally
devoid of merit and as such it is not sustainable.
    It	is convenient to refer in this connection the  deci-
sion cited at the bar in <a href="/doc/1481813/" id="a_31">Wazir Chand and Another v. State of
Haryana</a>	 with State of Haryana v. Wazir Chand  and  Another,
[1989]	1  SCC 244 to which one of us (B.C. Ray,  J)  was  a
party,	wherein	 it has been held that "a plain	 reading  of
this provision (S. 306 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_32">I.P.C</a>) shows that before a person can
be convicted of abetting the suicide of any other person, it
must  be established that such other person  committed	sui-
cide." This decision is not at all applicable to the instant
case  in  view	of our specific finding	 that  the  evidence
adduced on behalf of the prosecution clearly establish	that
the deceased Ravinder Kaur committed suicide at the instiga-
tion  and abetment of the accused persons in the  commission
of the said offence.
</p><p id="p_22">    The	 next argument advanced is that the  evidences	were
too meagre and unreliable to sustain the conviction. It	 has
also been urged that the High Court considered the evidences
and came to a reasonable finding that the prosecution  could
not  prove the ingredients of <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_33">Section 306</a>, <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_34">IPC</a> as there	 was
no  instigation by the accused nor there was any  conspiracy
for  the commission of that offence. The High Court  arrived
at  this finding on some contradictions in the statement  of
the  evidences	of P.W. 4, Gurbachan Singh,  father  of	 the
deceased and of P.W. 7, Surjeet Kaur, sister of the deceased
respectively  with their statements made under	<a href="/doc/447673/" id="a_35">Section	 161</a>
Cr. P.C.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">304</span>
<p id="p_23">    It is convenient to refer in this connection the  obser-
vation	made by this Court in the case of <a href="/doc/916840/" id="a_36">Sat Pal  v.  Delhi
Administration</a>,	 [1976]	 2  SCR 11 at 30  to  the  following
effect:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">	      "It emerges clear that on a criminal  prosecu-
	      tion  when  a witness  is	 cross-examined	 and
	      contradicted  with the leave of the court,  by
	      the party calling him, his evidence cannot, as
	      a matter of law, be treated as washed off	 the
	      record altogether. It is for the Judge of fact
	      to  consider in each case whether as a  result
	      of  such cross-examination and  contradiction,
	      the  witness stands thoroughly discredited  or
	      can  still be believed in regard to a part  of

<p id="p_24">    We have already referred to the material portions of the
FIR  as	 well as all the statements made by P.W.  4  in	 his
evidence as well as his statement under <a href="/doc/447673/" id="a_37">Section 161</a> Cr. P.C.
as  well as the evidence of P.W. 7 and her  statement  under
<a href="/doc/447673/" id="a_38">Section 161</a> Cr. P.C. On a plain reading of these  statements
it will be crystal clear that the accused persons since	 the
date  when the deceased, Ravinder Kaur went to her  in-laws'
house after the marriage, was mal-treated and was constantly
taunted,  harassed and tortured for not bringing  sufficient
dowry  from her father and she was taunted for	carrying  an
illegitimate child. The appellant sometime in November, 1982
went  to  her  in-laws house. His  daughter,  Ravinder	Kaur
complained to him about this torture and constant taunts for
not  bringing sufficient dowry. On hearing this, her  father
brought	 her to his house and after eight days	the  accused
persons,  Satpal Singh, his father Harbhajhan Singh and	 two
maternal  uncles  came	to the house of	 the  appellant	 and
requested  him to send his daughter with them assuring	that
there would be no further taunts or any iII-treatment by the
respondents. The President of the Mohalla Sudhar  Committee,
Ved  Prakash, P.W. 5 and a social worker, Smt.	Raj  Kumari,
P.W.  6 and another person Ramesh Kumar of the same  village
were called in by Gurbachan Singh and in their presence	 all
these  talks were held. On the assurances  given,  Gurbachan
Singh  sent his daughter with them. It is also	in  evidence
that as no information of her was received, Gurbachan  Singh
sent his two other daughters namely Surjeet Kaur, P.W. 7 and
Sajinder Kaur, to the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">305</span>
house  of the in-laws of the deceased Ravinder Kaur  to	 en-
quire about her welfare. Ravinder Kaur told them that  there
was no improvement in the treatment meted out to her and she
was  being taunted and tortured by her in-laws in  the	same
way and she was not happy. Two days thereafter i.e. on	25th
June, 1983 at 2.30 P.M. this unfortunate incident  occurred.
P.W.  7, Gurjeet Kaur also stated in her deposition  to	 the
same effect. In her statement under <a href="/doc/447673/" id="a_39">Section 161</a> Cr. P.C. she
also stated categorically that after about one month of	 the
marriage  whenever Ravinder Kaur met her she told  that	 her
in-laws i.e. the respondents were not treating her well	 for
bringing less dowry. She was also told that the	 respondents
were  demanding	 refrigerator and a scooter. They  had	also
taunted that she was having illegitimate child. She  further
stated that two days prior to the present occurrence she and
her  sister,  Sajinder Kaur went to Raja  Sansi	 to  enquire
about the welfare of our sister, Ravinder Kaur who told them
weepingly that she was being beaten by the accused and again
was  mal-treated  for bringing less dowry  and	scooter	 and
fridge	etc.  She further stated that the  respondents	were
leveling allegations that she had been carrying an illegiti-
mate  child and that she should die. It was also  stated  by
her  that her mother-in-law, Kanwaldip Kaur was	 present  in
the  house  and	 she  was abusing  Ravinder  Kaur  in  their
presence.
</p><p id="p_25">    The	 learned Sessions Judge after carefully	 considering
and  weighing the evidences held that the witnesses P.W.  4,
Gurbachan  Singh,  P.W.	 5, Ved Prakash,  President  of	 the
Mohalla	 Sudhar Committee, P.W. 6, Smt. Raj  Kumari,  social
worker	and  P.W. 7, Surjeet Kaur clearly  proved  that	 the
respondents  mal-treated  Ravinder Kaur	 for  bringing	less
dowry  and they even tortured her for carrying an  illegiti-
mate  child. The said witnesses testified to the greedy	 and
lusty nature of the respondents that they were	persistently
demanding  more money. It has also been held that the  worst
part of the cruelty was that she was even taunted for carry-
ing an illegitimate child. The Trial Court also held that  a
respectable  lady cannot bear this kind of false  allegation
levelled  against her and this must have  mentally  tortured
her.  Thus  the persistent demands of the accused  for	more
money, their tortures and taunts amounted to instigation and
abetment that compelled her to do away with her life.
    This  finding  was arrived at by  the  learned  Sessions
Judge  on a proper appreciation of the evidences adduced  by
the prosecution. The High Court without properly considering
and weighing the evidences of the prosecution witnesses	 and
on  a  wrong appreciation of the evidences  found  that	 the
prosecution failed to prove the ingredients of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">306</span>
<a href="/doc/92983/" id="a_40">Section	 306</a>  of I.P.C. It was also held that there  was  no
evidence  on record that the accused at the time of  commis-
sion of suicide by Ravinder Kaur, deceased in any way insti-
gated  or abetted her to commit suicide even though  it	 has
been  brought but in evidences that the deceased  was  being
maltreated  by the accused continuously after her coming  to
the  house  of	her in-laws. It was further  held  that	 the
prosecution  has singularly failed to establish	 the  charge
against the accused and their conviction and sentences	were
consequently unsustainable.
</p><p id="p_26">    We have already stated hereinfore that P.W. 4, Gurbachan
Singh,	P.W.  7, Surjeet Kaur have clearly stated  in  their
depositions  about the ill-treatment, torture and the  cruel
behaviour  meted  out to the deceased  Ravinder	 Kaur  which
instigated her to take the extreme step of putting an end to
her life by sprinkling kerosene oil on her body and  setting
fire.  We  have	 also stated hereinbefore  that	 though	 the
incident occurred at 2.30 P.M. the information of the  death
of Ravinder Kaur by burning was given to her father,  Gurba-
chan  Singh at 6.30 P.M. in his shop at Amritsar.  Gurbachan
Singh  with members of his family immediately rushed to	 the
hospital and found the dead body of her daughter in the dead
house of the hospital. It is also in evidence that  Ravinder
Kaur  was brought to the hospital after much delay when	 she
was already dead.
</p><p id="p_27">    The	 Trial Court rightly held that in such cases  direct
evidence  is  hardly  available. It  is	 the  circumstantial
evidence and the conduct of the accused persons which are to
be taken into consideration for adjudicating upon the trust-
fulness or otherwise of the prosecution case.
    We	have already referred to hereinbefore the  evidences
of  the prosecution witnesses who clearly testified  to	 the
greedy and lusty nature of the accused in that they persist-
ently  taunted the deceased and tortured her for not  having
brought	 sufficient  dowry from her father. It	is  also  in
evidence that they also taunted her for carrying an illegit-
imate child. All these tortures and taunts caused depression
to  her mind and drove her to take the extreme step of	put-
ting  an end to her life by sprinkling kerosene oil  on	 her
person and setting fire. Circumstantial evidence as well  as
the  evidences	of the prosecution witnesses  clearly  prove
beyond reasonable doubt that the accused persons  instigated
and abetted Ravinder Kaur, deceased in the commission of the
offence by committing suicide by burning herself. The  find-
ings  arrived  at by the Trial Court after  considering	 and
weighing
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">307</span>
the entire evidences are unexceptional. The findings arrived
at  by the High Court without considering properly the	cir-
cumstantial evidence as well as the evidences of the  prose-
cution	witnesses cannot be sustained. As such the  findings
of the High Court are liable to be reversed and set aside.
    The	 High  Court drew an inference from the	 conduct  of
Gurbachan Singh, P.W. 4 in making a delay of about 24  hours
after  receipt of the information regarding  her  daughter's
death  to make a statement to the police about the  incident
with lodging the F.I.R. on the same date, i.e. June 25, 1983
or on the following morning. The High Court, therefore, held
that all these circumstances would raise considerable  doubt
regarding the veracity of the evidence of these two witness-
es  (P.W.  4  and P.W. 7) and point an	infirmity  in  their
evidence as would render it unsafe to base the conviction of
the accused.
</p><p id="p_28">    It	is in evidence of P.W. 4 that he was intimate  about
the  death  of his daughter by committing  suicide,  by	 the
maternal uncle of Satpal Singh, son-in-law on June 25,	1983
at  about  5.30 p.m. He immediately rushed to  the  hospital
with  members of his family where his daughter was  brought.
It  is also in his evidence that he stayed there  the  whole
night with his wife and other members of his family near the
dead body of his deceased daughter and also on the next	 day
till the dead body was handed over to him after the  comple-
tion  of  post martem in the afternoon. The  Assistant	Sub-
Inspector  of Police of Ajnala Police Station  reached	SGTB
Hospital  on the next day i.e. on June 26, 1983 and got	 his
statement  recorded there. It has been rightly held  by	 the
Additional  Sessions  Judge  that in  the  circumstances  it
cannot	be said that there has been any delay  in  reporting
the  matter to the police. We fully accept this	 finding  of
the  Additional	 Sessions Judge and we also  held  that	 the
delay in lodging the FIR in the above circumstances does not
raise  any  doubt  regarding the veracity of  the  said	 two
witnesses and there is no infirmity in the evidences of P.W.
4  and	P.W. 7 which would render them unsafe  to  base	 the
conviction  of the accused as wrongly observed by  the	High
Court.
</p><p id="p_29">    It is also convenient to refer to this connection to the
provisions  of	<a href="/doc/294349/" id="a_41">Section 113A</a> of Indian	Evidence  Act,	1872
which provide that:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">	      "113-A. Presumption as to abetment of  suicide
	      by  a  married  women--When  the	question  is
	      whether  the commission of suicide by a  woman
	      had  been abetted by her husband or any  rela-
	      tive of her husband and it is shown that
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">	      308</span>
	      she  had committed suicide within a period  of
	      seven years from the date of her marriage	 and
	      that  her	 husband  or such  relative  of	 her
	      husband  had  subjected her  to  cruelty,	 the
	      court  may presume, having regard to  all	 the
	      other  circumstances  of the case,  that	such
	      suicide had been abetted by her husband or  by
	      such relative of her husband."</blockquote>
<p id="p_30">    In	the  instant  case the deceased	 Ravinder  Kaur	 was
married	 to the accused, Satpal Singh in November, 1982	 and
she  committed	suicide on June 25, 1983. It has  also	been
found on a consideration of the circumstantial evidence that
she  was  compelled to take the extreme step  of  committing
suicide as the accused persons had subjected her to  cruelty
by constant taunts, mal-treatment and also by alleging	that
she  has  been carrying an illegitimate child.	The  suicide
having	been committed within a period of seven	 years	from
the  date of her marriage in accordance with the  provisions
of this Section, the Court may presume having regard to	 all
the  other circumstances of the case which we have  set	 out
earlier	 that such suicide has been abetted by	the  husband
and his relations. Therefore, the findings arrived at by the
Additional  Sessions Judge are quite in accordance with	 the
provisions of this Section and the finding of the High Court
that the accused persons could not be held to have instigate
or abetted the commission of offence, is not sustainable  in
law.
</p><p id="p_31">    It has been contended on behalf of the  accused-respond-
ents  that  <a href="/doc/294349/" id="a_42">Section  113-A</a> of the Indian  Evidence  Act	 was
inserted in the Statutes Book by Act 46 of 1983 whereas	 the
offence under <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_43">Section 306</a>, <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_44">I.P.C</a>. was committed on June	 23,
1983  i.e. prior to the insertion of the said  provision  in
the  <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_45">Indian Evidence Act</a>. It has, therefore, been  submitted
by  the learned counsel for the respondents that the  provi-
sions  of  this Section cannot be taken	 recourse  to  while
coming to a finding regarding the presumption as to abetment
of  suicide committed by a marriage woman, against  the	 ac-
cused persons.
</p><p id="p_32">    The provisions of the said Section do not create any new
offence and as such it does not create any substantial right
but  it is merely a matter of procedure of evidence  and  as
such  it  is retrospective and will be	applicable  to	this
case. It is profitable to refer in this connection to  Hals-
bury's Laws of England, (Fourth Edition), Volume 44 Page 570
wherein it has been stated that:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">	      "The  general rule as mat all statutes,  other
	      than  those  which are merely  declaratory  or
	      which relate only to mat-
</blockquote><span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">	      309</span>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">	      ters  of procedure or of evidence,  are  prima
	      facie prospective, and retrospective effect is
	      not  to  be given to them unless,	 by  express
	      words  or	 necessary implication,	 it  appears
	      that this was the intention of the legislature
		  It has also been stated in the said volume
	      of Halsbury's Law of England at page 574 that:
	      "The  presumption against	 retrospection	does
	      not apply to legislation concerned merely with
	      matters  of procedure or of evidence;  on	 the
	      contrary, provisions of that nature are to  be
	      construed	 as retrospective unless there is  a
	      clear indication that such was not the  inten-
	      tion of Parliament."</blockquote>
<p id="p_33">    In	Blyth  v. Blyth, [1966] A.C. 643 the wife  left	 the
husband	 in  1954  and lived with  the	co-respondent  until
August,	 1955, when she broke off the association.  In	1958
the  husband and wife met by chance and	 sexual	 intercourse
took place. In December, 1962, the husband sought a  divorce
on the ground of his wife's adultery. During the pendency of
the  application  section 1 of the Matrimonial	Causes	Act,
1963  came into force on July 31, 1963 which  provided	that
any presumption of condonation which arises from the contin-
uance  or resumption of marital intercourse may be  rebutted
on the part of a husband, as well as on the part a of  wife,
by evidence sufficient to negative the necessary intent. The
question arose whether this provision which came into  force
on July 31, 1963 can be applied in the instant case. It	 was
held  that  the husband's evidence was	admissible  in	that
<a href="/doc/1093366/" id="a_46">Section 1</a> of the Act of 1963 only altered the law as to	 the
admissibility  of evidence and the effect which	 the  courts
are  to	 give to evidence, so that the rule  against  giving
retrospective effect to Acts of Parliament did not apply.
    In	Herridge v. Herridge, [1966] 1 AER 93 similar  ques-
tion arose, it was held that <a href="/doc/1893993/" id="a_47">section 2(1)</a> of the Act of 1963
was  a procedural provision, for it dealt with the  adducing
of  evidence in relation to an allegation of condonation  in
any  trial after July 31, 1963; accordingly  the  subsection
was  applicable, even though the evidence related to  events
before that date, and the resumption of cohabitation in	 the
present	 case did not amount, by reason of <a href="/doc/1893993/" id="a_48">Section 2(1)</a>,  to
condonation.
</p><p id="p_34">On a conspectus of these decisions, this argument on  behalf
of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">310</span>
the  appellant	fails and as such  the	presumption  arising
under  <a href="/doc/294349/" id="a_49">Section	113-A</a> of The Evidence Act has  been  rightly
taken into consideration by the Trial Court.
    It	has been urged by referring to the decision in	<a href="/doc/590455/" id="a_50">Brij
Lal  v.	 Prem Chand &amp; Anr., JT</a> 1989 3 SC 1  that  where	 two
views  could reasonably be taken the appellate court  should
not interfere with the order of acquittal made by the  Trial
Court.
</p><p id="p_35">    In the instant case on a proper consideration and weigh-
ing  of the evidences the only reasonable view that  can  be
taken  is that the cruel behaviour and constant	 taunts	 and
harassment  caused  by the accused  persons  while  Ravinder
Kaur,  deceased was in her in-laws house instigated  her  to
commit	suicide and in our considered opinion no other	rea-
sonable	 view  follows from a proper consideration  and	 ap-
praisement of the evidences on record. As such the  decision
cited above is not applicable to the facts and circumstances
of the instant case.
</p><p id="p_36">    For the reasons aforesaid we set aside the judgment	 and
order  of acquittal passed by the High Court and affirm	 the
conviction  of the accused of the offence under <a href="/doc/92983/" id="a_51">Section	 306</a>
I.P.C.	and  sentence imposed upon them	 by  the  Additional
Sessions  Judge, Amritsar. The respondents will	 immediately
surrender in the Court of Sessions Judge, Amritsar to  serve
out the remaining period of their sentence.
