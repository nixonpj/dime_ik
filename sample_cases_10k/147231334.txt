               (HAMENDRA RAJPUT Vs THE STATE OF MADHYA PRADESH)


23-11-2015

Shri Shiv Kumar Shrivastava, learned counsel for the applicants-
accused.
Smt. D. K. Bohre, learned P.P. for the respondent/State.</pre>
<p id="p_1">Case diary is available.
</p><p id="p_2">This is first bail application filed by the applicants / accused under
<a href="/doc/1783708/" id="a_1">section 438</a> of Cr.P.C. for grant of anticipatory bail, apprehending
their arrest in connection with Crime No.93/15, Police Station
Sanjeevani Nagar, Jabalpur, offences registered under <a href="/doc/838469/" id="a_2">sections 452</a>
and <a href="/doc/764237/" id="a_3">394</a> of the IPC.
</p><p id="p_3">Learned counsel for the applicants submits that the allegations made
against the applicants-accused are totally false and concocted. It was
a pity dispute which has been converted into a heinous offence so
that the applicants-accused may be arrested in the case. The
allegations made against the applicants-accused are totally false and
concocted as the alleged incident took place on 25.10.2015 but the
written report was submitted at the police station on 27.10.2015
exaggerating the incident. Moreover, the offence under <a href="/doc/838469/" id="a_4">section 452</a>
of the IPC is not made out in this case because when the applicants-
accused entered the wine shop they had not come prepared to hurt,
assault or wrongful restrain the complainant and his companions.
Besides it, there is no evidence on record against the applicants-
accused about their involvement for committing robbery. On the
aforesaid grounds, learned counsel for the applicants / accused has
prayed for grant of anticipatory bail.
</p><p id="p_4">Learned Panel Lawyer opposing the submissions made on behalf of
the applicants has prayed for rejection of the anticipatory bail
 application.
</p><p id="p_5">Heard the arguments of both the parties.
</p><p id="p_6">On perusal of the contents of the FIR it appears that when the
applicants-accused entered the complainant's wine shop, they had
not come prepared to assault, wrongful restrain or hurt. Moreover, no
property was looted by them. The submissions made on behalf of the
applicants-accused appear to be convincing.
Keeping in view the aforesaid facts and circumstances of the case,
this application is allowed. It is ordered that the applicants-accused
shall appear before the concerned Police station within 15 days from
today and if they are arrested by the Investigating officer, they be
released on bail on their furnishing bail bond and surety bond each
for a sum of Rs.25,000/-. If they fail to do so, the effect of this order
shall be vacated automatically.
</p><p id="p_7">The applicants-accused are directed to join the investigation
immediately and fully cooperate with the investigation. They shall
further abide by the other conditions enumerated in sub-section (2) of
<a href="/doc/1783708/" id="a_5">Section 438</a> of Cr.P.C.
</p><p id="p_8">Certified copy as per rules.
</p>
