ORAL
JUDGMENT</pre> 

 

 
 


 

<p id="p_1">1.	The
present appeal, under section 378(1) (3) of the Code of Criminal
Procedure, 1973, is directed against the judgment and order of
acquittal dated 15.3.1999 passed by the learned Additional Sessions
Judge, Vadodara in Criminal Appeal No.19 of 1998, whereby the accused
has been acquitted from the charges leveled against him.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_2">2.	The
brief facts of the prosecution case are as under:
</p> 

 


 

 


 

<p id="p_3">2.1	The
complainant   Food Inspector purchased groundnut oil from the shop
of respondent and after following due procedure sent the sample to
the Public Analyst and report reveled that sample did not conform to
the provisions of Rule 17.03 of the <a href="/doc/32969400/" id="a_1">Prevention of Food Adulteration
Act</a>, 1954. Therefore, complaint was filed for the offences under
Section 7(1) and 16(1) (A) (i) of the <a href="/doc/32969400/" id="a_2">Prevention of Food Adulteration
Act</a>, against the accused person.	
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_4">2.2	Therefore,
 Criminal Case No.1823 of 1986 with respect to the aforesaid offence
was filed against the respondent before the learned Judicial
Magistrate, First Class, Sankheda.  
</p>
 


 


 

<p id="p_5">2.3	To
prove the case against the present accused, the prosecution has also
produced documentary evidence and has examined three witnesses. After
hearing the parties, the learned trial Judge was pleased to convict
the accused   respondent by his judgment and order dated 5.2.1998,
to undergo rigorous imprisonment for one year with a fine of
Rs.2,000/-, in default, simple imprisonment of 6 months. Against the
said judgment and order, the respondent   accused preferred
Criminal Appeal being No.19 of 1998 before the learned Additional
Sessions Judge at Vadodara. After hearing the parties, learned
Additional Sessions Judge was pleased to acquit the accused by his
order dated 15.3.1999.
</p> 
	 
		 


	

 

<p id="p_6">3.	Being
aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the aforesaid judgment and order
passed by the learned Sessions Court the appellant the complainant
and State has preferred the present appeal.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_7">4.	It
was contended by learned APP Mr. Jani that the judgment and order of
the Sessions Court is against the provisions of law; the Sessions
Court has not properly considered the evidence led by the prosecution
and looking to the provisions of law itself it is established that
the prosecution has proved the whole ingredients of the evidence
against the present respondent. Learned APP has also taken this court
 through the oral as well  as the entire documentary evidence. He has
contended that the learned trial Judge has not considered the
evidence of the Food Inspector and therefore, it cannot be said that
there is a breach of provisions of <a href="/doc/129679104/" id="a_3">Section 4</a> of the Prevention of
Food Adulteration Act. He has contended that the learned Judge has
not considered the aspect that as per the provisions of Section 2
Sub-section (m), it is prescribed under the Act that if the sample
does not conform to the standard as prescribed under the Act, then it
is adulterated. The accused had not fulfilled the provisions,
therefore, the accused is not entitled for warranty under <a href="/doc/129536203/" id="a_4">Section
19(2)</a> of the Act. Therefore, the order is required to be quashed and
set aside. 
</p>
 

<p id="p_8">4.1	Thus,
it is a settled principle that while exercising appellate power, even
if two reasonable conclusions are possible on the basis of the
evidence on record, the appellate court should not disturb the
finding  of acquittal recorded by the trial court.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_9">4.2	Even
in a recent decision of the Apex Court in the case of <a href="/doc/585040/" id="a_5">State
of Goa V. Sanjay Thakran &amp; Anr. Reported</a> in (2007)3 SCC 75,
the  Court has reiterated the powers of the High Court in such cases.
In para 16 of the said decision the Court has observed as under:
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_10"> 16.	From
the aforesaid decisions, it is apparent that while exercising the
powers in appeal against the order of acquittal the Court of appeal
would not ordinarily interfere with the order of acquittal unless the
approach of the lower Court is vitiated by some manifest illegality
and the conclusion arrived at would not be arrived at by any
reasonable person and, therefore, the decision is to be characterized
as perverse. Merely because two views are possible, the Court of
appeal would not take the view which would upset the judgement
delivered by the  Court below. However, the appellate court has a
power to review the evidence if it is of the view that the conclusion
arrived at by the Court below is perverse and the Court has committed
a manifest error of law and ignored the material evidence on record.
A duty is cast upon the appellate court, in such circumstances, to
re-appreciate the evidence to arrive to a just decision on the basis
of material placed on record to find out whether any of the accused
is connected with the commission of the crime he is charged with. 
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_11">4.3	Similar
principle has been laid down by the Apex  Court  in the cases of
State
of Uttar Pradesh Vs. Ram Veer Singh &amp; Ors, reported
in 2007 AIR SCW 5553
and in Girja
Prasad (Dead) by LRs Vs. state of MP, reported in 2007 AIR SCW 5589.
Thus, the powers which this Court may exercise against an order of
acquittal are well settled.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_12">4.4	It
is also a settled legal position that in acquittal appeal, the
appellate court is not required to re-write the judgment or to give
fresh reasonings, when the reasons assigned by the Court below are
found to be just and proper. Such principle is laid down by the Apex
Court in the  case of State
of Karnataka Vs. Hemareddy, reported in AIR 1981 SC 1417
wherein it is held as under:
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_13"> &amp;
This court
has observed in Girija Nandini Devi V. Bigendra Nandini Chaudhary
(1967)1 SCR 93: (AIR 1967 SC 1124) that it is not the duty of the
appellate court when it agrees with the view of the trial court on
the evidence to repeat the narration of the evidence or to reiterate
the reasons given by the trial court expression of general agreement
with the reasons given by the Court the decision of which is under
appeal, will ordinarily suffice. 
</p> 

 


 

 


 

<p id="p_14">5.	I
have gone through the judgment and order passed by the trial court. I
have also perused the oral as well as documentary evidence led by the
trial court and also considered the submissions made by learned APP
for the appellant. It appears from the judgment and order of the
learned trial Court that he had not taken into consideration the
evidence of the witness led before him in a proper manner and
especially, regarding <a href="/doc/129536203/" id="a_6">Section 19(2)</a> of the Act.  I have also perused
the judgment and order passed by the learned Additional Sessions
Judge, Vadodara, in which, the learned Sessions Judge has observed
that the commodity was not injuries to the public health, the accused
should not have convicted and in the analysis report, there was no
presence of mineral oil, castor oil and artificial coal tar colour.
Even Baudouin test was reported to be in negative, the accused who
was simple vendor cannot be held guilty. Thus, from the observation
of the record, it is established that the complainant did not follow
meticulously the mandatory requirement prescribed under the Act.
Therefore also, the judgment and order passed by the learned
Additional Sessions Judge, Vadodara is right, just and proper.  
</p>
 

 


 

<p id="p_15">6.	Learned
APP is not in a position to show any evidence to take a contrary view
of the matter or that the approach of the trial court is vitiated by
some manifest illegality or that the decision is perverse or that the
trial court has ignored the material evidence on record.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_16">7.	In
the above view of the matter, I am of the considered opinion that the
trial court was completely justified in acquitting the respondent of
the charges leveled against him. 
</p>
 

 


 

<p id="p_17">8.	I
find that the findings recorded by the trial court are absolutely
just and proper and in recording the said findings, no illegality or
infirmity has been committed by it. 
</p>
 

 


 

<p id="p_18">9.	I
am, therefore, in complete agreement with the findings, ultimate
conclusion and the resultant order of acquittal recorded by the court
below and hence find no reasons to interfere with the same. Hence the
appeal is hereby dismissed. Bail bond, if any, stands cancelled.
Record and proceedings to be sent back to trial Court, forthwith.
</p>
