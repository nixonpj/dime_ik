Judgment

</p><p id="p_2">1.             By this order, I shall dispose of the revision petition filed by 

     the revisionist against the order dt. 24.02.2011, passed by Ld. ACMM, 

     whereby the revisionist was ordered to be summoned to face the trial 

     for the offence under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_1">section 138</a> N.I. Act. 
</p>
<p id="p_3">2.             Brief facts of the present case are that  the respondent filed a 

     complaint under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_2">section 138</a> N.I. Act, 1881.     In the year 2006, the 

     revisionist approached the respondent for some financial assistance in 

     the form of loan to meet some emergent business requirement.   The 

     respondent   was   not   interested   to   provide   the   said   financial 

     assistance/loan   to   the   revisionist   but   the   revisionist   somehow 
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                             2 </span>

     convinced   the   respondent   by   making   various   false   promises   and 

     assurances and also promised to hand over the advance cheques to be 

     issued   in   favour   of   the   respondent.   Thereafter,   the   respondent   on 

     regular intervals deposited the cheques with its banker and the same 

     were   being   encashed.   However,   amongst   others,   three   advance 

     cheques   issued   by   the   accused   were   bounced.     M/s   Triveni 

     Infrastructure Ltd. has issued following cheque no. 180096, 180097 

     and   180098   amounting   to   Rs.5,00,000/足   each   on   16.05.2010, 

     26.05.2010  and  15.06.2010  respectively.    The respondent  deposited 

     the said cheque with their bankers but the same were dishonoured.  On 

     the present of the said cheques, they were returned unpaid with the 

     remarks  "Funds  insufficient".    Thereafter,  the  respondent  issued  an 

     alleged notice dt. 03.09.2010 Under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_3">section 138</a> N.I. Act.  On the basis 

     of the above said allegations, the respondent filed a complaint under 

     <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_4">section 138</a> N.I. Act.   Ld. MM has summoned the revisionist as an 

     accused, vide order dt. 24.02.2011. 
</p>
<p id="p_4">3.       Having  felt  aggrieved  by  the  order  of  Ld. Trial  Court,  vide  dt. 

</p><p id="p_5">     24.02.2011, the present revision petition was filed.  

</p><p id="p_6">4.       Arguments on revision petition heard at length.  During the course 

     of arguments, Ld. counsel for the revisionist filed a list of judgments 
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                               3 </span>

     along with copy of judgments and he stressed that judgment no.1 to 5 

     are most important for the disposal of the revision petition.  He further 

     submits that the cheque was issued by Crossroad and case has been 

     filed by Om Telecom Pvt. Ltd.  On these grounds, he submits that it is 

     a settled law that whenever accused be summoned a specific reason 

     while issuing the summons in the present case, must be given, but no 

     specific order is made in this regard. 
</p>
<p id="p_7">5.       I   have   given   careful   consideration   to   the   submissions   of   Ld. 

</p><p id="p_8">     counsel   for   the   revisionist   and   have   also   perused   the   material   on 

     record. 
</p>
<p id="p_9">6.       I have perused all the citations relied upon by Ld. Counsel for the 

     revisionist and has also perused the case file.  Perusal of the case file 

     reveals   that   it   has   come   on   record   that   earlier   the   name   of   the 

     respondent  company  happens  to be M/s Cross  Roads Logistics Pvt. 

     Ltd.,   vide   Ex.CW1/1   in   the   form   of   affidavit   filed   by   authorized 

     representative     of   M/s   Om   Telecom   Logistics   Pvt.   Ltd.     The 

     contentions  of  Ld. Counsel  for the revisionist  is that  three cheques 

     were   issued   in   the   name   of   M/s   Cross   Roads   Logistics   Pvt.   Ltd 

     whereas the case has been filed by M/s Omtelecom Logistics Pvt. Ltd. 

     To my view, this is a pure question of fact and in this regard, as per the 
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                               4 </span>

    procedural law, the revisionist would be given an opportunity to lead 

    his defence during the course of trial.   So, he has an opportunity to 

    raise this issue at appropriate stage before the court of Ld. MM.  This 

    court   is   conscious   of   the   fact   that   issuing   the   process   against   the 

    revisionist is purely the discretion of original court of jurisdiction and 

    this court has a limited jurisdiction to review the question of facts on 

    the principle of propriety and correctness.   Having found on record 

    that the respondent company happens to be in the name and style of 

    M/s Cross Roads Logistics Pvt. Ltd prior to the change of the name of 

    the respondent company.   In view of this, the revision petition does 

    not deserve any merits to succeed at this stage.  However, Ld. Counsel 

    for the revisionists relied upon following judgments :  

</p><p id="p_10">        (i)  Raj   Kumari   Mittal   Vs   R.D.   Nautiyal,   passed   by   Sh.   N.K. 

    Kaushik, Ld. ASJ, Delhi.

</p><p id="p_15">7.       I   have   gone   through   the   aforesaid   orders,   in   view   of   judgment 

     passed by Sh. N.K. Kaushik, Ld. ASJ, the summoning order requires 

     to be just and appears to have been passed with actual application of 

     mind.  Bare perusal of the order of summoning reveals that no reason 

     has   been   given   disclosing   the   fact   with   regard   to   arrive   at   the 

     conclusion for issue of summons against the revisionist.  In the light of 

     this, I set aside the order dt. 24.02.2011, qua revisionist Madhur Mittal 

     and Ld. Trial Court is directed to pass a speaking order with respect to 

     the revisionist.  Parties are directed to appear before the Ld. Trial court 

     on 01.06.2012.
