                                  .........
                   Date of Order         :     17/10/2008
                           PRESENT
             HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE H.R.PANWAR
Mr. Sudhir Sharma for the petitioner.
Mr. K.L.Thakur, Addl. Advocate General for the State.
Mr. P.P.Chaudhary for the respondent No.3.

BY THE COURT</pre>


<p id="p_1">            After having heard the matter finally, the counsel for

the parties by an application being I.A. No.14366/08 submit that

the writ petition may be disposed of in view of the compromise

agreement entered into by the petitioners and the respondent No.3

M/s V.S.Lignite Power Pvt. Ltd. in respect of the acquisition of land

which is subject matter of the instant writ petition.

</p><p id="p_2">            The land in question is situated in village Gurha, Tehsil

Kolayat, District Bikaner. A notification under <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_1">Section 4</a> of the Land

Acquisition Act, 1894 (for short 'the Act' hereinafter) for acquisition

of the land for public purpose for setting up Lignite based Electricity

Generation Power Plant, was issued. The notification under <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_2">Section

6</a> r/w <a href="/doc/1797812/" id="a_3">Section 17</a> (4) of the Act was also published after following

due process of law. The award has been passed by the Land

Acquisition Officer and as per the direction of the Land Acquisition
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                  2</span>

Officer, the amount of compensation as awarded by the Land

Acquisition Officer has already been deposited by the respondent

No.3 company with the authorised officer of the respondent State

and the possession of the land has already been handed over long

back to   the   respondent company. However,        the acquisition

proceedings came to be challenged by way of instant writ petition

by the petitioners who are recorded Khatedar/ interested person.

</p><p id="p_3">           During pendency of the writ petition, the petitioners

and the respondent company have mutually agreed to enter into a

compromise in order to settle the dispute in respect of the land in

question which is subject matter of the acquisition through a

"Compromise Agreement" annexed with application as Annex.A/1.

By the said compromise agreement the respondent company

voluntarily agreed to enhance the compensation in addition to what

has been deposited by the company and accepted by the

petitioners and the respondent company is prepared to deposit the

enhanced differential compensation with the Land Acquisition

Officer as per the directions of this Court and the petitioner/

interested persons would be free to withdraw the same. The

petitioners undertake to surrender all the original title documents

that are in their possession relating to the land in question.   On

receipt of the enhanced differential compensation under the

agreement, the petitioners shall have no right, possession, lien,

title on the land and shall not dispute the acquisition of the land,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                         3</span>

     compensation     awarded   and    quantum        of    compensation.     The

     petitioners also agree that they have no grievance with the process

     followed by the respondents for acquisition of the land which was

     acquired by respondent State for the respondent company and the

     petitioners' claim through this writ petition was only to the extent

     of enhancement of compensation. The Compromise Agreement has

     been entered into on 26th September, 2008 between the petitioners

     and the respondent No.3 company.
</p>
<p id="p_4">                  Since the parties have settled the dispute by the

     compromise agreement Annex.A/1 and therefore, learned counsel

     for the petitioners submits that nothing survives in the writ petition

     and the same may be disposed of in terms of the compromise

     agreement Annex.A/1 annexed with the application.

</p><p id="p_5">                  The writ petition is therefore, disposed of in terms of

     the   Compromise      Agreement    (Annex.A/1)         annexed    with   the

     application. The said Compromise Agreement Annex.A/1 is made

     Rule of the Court and shall form the part of this order. The

     respondent    company    shall   deposit   the        enhanced   differential

     compensation with the Land Acquisition Officer within a period of

     four weeks and the petitioner/ interested persons would be free to

     withdraw the same. The Application being I.A. No. 14366/08

     stands disposed of.
