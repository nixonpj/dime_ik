      THIS WRIT PETITION IS FILED UNDER ARTICLES 226 AND
227 OF THE CONSTITUTION OF INDIA, PRAYING TO QUASH THE
ORDER DATED 02.08.2012 PASSED ON I.A.NO.25 IN
O.S.NO.35/2003 BY THE PRL. CIVIL JUDGE AT SINDHANUR,
THE CERTIFIED COPY OF WHICH IS AT ANNEXURE-G.

     THIS WRIT PETITION COMING ON FOR PRELIMINARY
HEARING THIS DAY, THE COURT MADE THE FOLLOWING:


                         ORDER
</pre>

<p id="p_1">      This is defendants writ petition assailing the order

passed by the Prl.Civil Judge &amp; JMFC, Sindhanur in

O.S.No.35/2003 allowing the application - I.A.XXV filed

under Order 26 Rule 10(3) read with Section 151 CPC

filed by plaintiff.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                              3</span><p id="p_2">




</p><p id="p_3">3.   Application for appointment of Commissioner was

filed in the instant case by plaintiff and same came to

be rejected which was questioned before this Court in

W.P.No.15708/2006, and same came to be allowed and

Commissioner was ordered to be appointed. Pursuant

to the same, Commissioner was appointed and he has

submitted a report on 20.06.2012. Defendants-2 and 3

have filed objections to said report.


</p><p id="p_4">4.     When the matter stood at it, plaintiffs filed one

more application under Order 26 Rule 10(3)         CPC

seeking for a direction to the Commissioner to make

further enquiry in the matter which was referred to him

by clarifying through rough sketch map showing

construction part of the building with due demarcation

of unauthorised portion made with respect to:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">     (1) dimension of main building as shown in his

         report;
</blockquote><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                 4</span><blockquote id="blockquote_2">




      (2) construction of drainage made towards eastern

            side of building;
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">      (3) construction made by way of steps in public

            PWD road; and

      (4) construction made by way of corridor extension

            between main building and steps towards

            western side of building

      and production of rough sketch/map thereof.



</blockquote><p id="p_5">5.    This application came to be resisted by defendant

Nos.2 and 3 and trial Court after considering rival

contentions, by its order dated 02.08.2012 has allowed

said application which is impugned in the present writ

petition.
</p>
<p id="p_6">
</p><p id="p_7">6.      The contention of learned counsel Sri Ameet

Kumar Deshpande is that sub-rule (3) of Rule 10 of

Order 26 CPC can be invoked only when Court comes to

a    conclusion      that   report     submitted   by   Court
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                  5</span>




Commissioner is not proper and after rejection of said

report and not earlier to the same.                 Further,     he

contends that trial Court committed a serious error in

allowing application while not rejecting the report of

Commissioner and keeping said report on record, it

could     not     have   allowed     application        once   again

appointing Commissioner.
</p>
<p id="p_8">
</p><p id="p_9">7.      In order to consider contentions raised by learned

counsel     appearing      for   petitioners,      it    would   be

appropriate to extract sub-rule (3) of Rule 10 of Order

26 CPC.
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">                "(3) Commissioner may be examined in
                person:- Where the Court is for any
                reason dissatisfied with the proceedings
                of the Commissioner, it may direct such
                further inquiry to be made as it shall
                think fit."
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">
</blockquote><p id="p_10">A reading of the above provision would clearly go to

show that in the event, Court, if for any reason is

'dissatisfied' with the proceedings of the Commissioner,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                  6</span>




it can direct for conducting such further enquiry to be

made.    Words that have been used in sub-rule (3)

'dissatisfaction'        and 'further enquiry' which would

clearly go to show that in the event of Court coming to

conclusion that it is not fully satisfied with report of

Commissioner,       it    may   call    upon   the   very   same

Commissioner to furnish further report or clarify doubts

that have been raised or in the alternative, it may reject

the report in toto and appoint a new Commissioner.


</p><p id="p_11">8.   In the circumstances on hand, trial Court has

noticed that for fair trial and proper adjudication of the

matter   in   dispute        and       to   avoid    unnecessary

complications while examining Court Commissioner

regarding measurement as reflected in the report, it is

necessary to direct the said Commissioner himself to

furnish sketch as per the measurement as shown in his

report which would meet ends of justice. It is noticed

that trial Court has not rejected the report. In the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                              7</span>




normal course, Commissioner who visits spot prepares

a rough sketch which would accompany the report.

Since same was not forthcoming along with report, trial

Court was of the view that by obtaining such rough

sketch, it would settle issues between the parties or it

would be necessary to appreciate and consider said

report in proper perspective and to effectively adjudicate

the dispute in question,     as such, it has allowed the

application in question. Trial Court can either reject

report   of   Commissioner    in   its   entirety    or   Court

Commissioner may be called upon to furnish further

details as the exigencies may command.              As noticed

supra, in the event of any of two exigencies as explained

herein above, the Court can adopt either of the course.

In the circumstances on hand, it has adopted the latter

course which cannot said to be contrary to sub-rule (3)

of Rule 10 of Order 26 CPC.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                8</span><p id="p_12">




</p><p id="p_13">9.         There is no merit in the writ petition.

Accordingly it is dismissed.
