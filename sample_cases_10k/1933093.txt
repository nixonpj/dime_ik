enquiry, the Conservator of Forests, Madurai Division has passed an order on
01.06.2007 and imposed a punishment of stoppage of increment for 3 years with
cumulative effect.  Against that order, the petitioner filed appeal before the
Principal Chief Conservator of Forests, Chennai, the first respondent herein,
which was confirmed on 05.05.2008. Against that, the petitioner filed W.P.(MD)
No.15140 of 2009 before this Court and this Court by order dated 03.08.2009,
while  allowing the writ petition set aside the punishment and remitted the
matter to the second respondent for fresh consideration. Thereafter, on

issued. The petitioner challenged the said charge memo before this Court in
W.P.(MD) No.12067 of 2009 and obtained an order of stay.  On 30.03.2010, the
second respondent has cancelled the earlier charge memo framed under Rule 17(b)
of TNCS (D&amp;A) Rules, which is the subject matter of challenge in W.P.(MD)
No.12067 of 2009. By virtue of order dated 08.04.2010, the said writ petition
was closed as infructous as no further order is required. By another order dated
30.03.2010, the second respondent framed the same charges under Rule 17(a) of
TNCS (D&amp;A) Rules. The petitioner is holding the post of Forester is eligible for
the post of Forest Ranger for the panel year 2009-10.  The promotion of the

Forest Ranger for the panel year 2009-10.

petitioner would submit that as per the consolidated instruction issued by the
Government for the preparation of panel for promotion, the pendency of charge
under Rule 17(a) of TNCS (D&amp;A) Rules need not be treated to be held against the
officer, irrespective of the seriousness of the delinquencies.

<p id="p_4">		4. In similar circumstances, this Court in <a href="/doc/1448235/" id="a_2">A.Karunanidhi v. The
Government of Tamil Nadu</a>, rep. by its Secretary, Public Works Department, Fort
St. George, Chennai - 600 009 reported in 2006 Writ L.R. 346, by relying upon
the said instructions has stated that pendency of charge under Rule 17(a) is not
a bar for the purpose of consideration and inclusion of such person to the next
promotion post. In the said decision, Honourable Mr. Justice N.Paul
Vasanthakumar by referring various judgments of the Hon'ble Supreme Court
including that of <a href="/doc/1405354/" id="a_3">Delhi Jal Board v. Mahinder Singh</a> reported in (2000) 7 SCC 210
and <a href="/doc/772919/" id="a_4">C.O. Arumugam and others v. the State of Tamil Nadu and others</a> reported in
1990(1) SLJ 185, allowed the writ petition directing that the petitioner therein
shall be included in the panel for the year 1997-1998.

	"As to the merits of the matter, it is necessary to state that every civil
servant has a right to have his case considered for promotion according to his

The consideration of promotion could be postponed only on reasonable grounds.
To avoid arbitrariness, it would be better to follow certain uniform principle.
The promotion of persons against whom charge has been framed in the disciplinary
proceedings or charge-sheet has been filed in criminal case may be deferred till
the proceedings are concluded.  They must, however, be considered for promotion
if they are exonerated or acquitted from the charges.  If found suitable, they
shall then be given the promotion with retrospective effect from the date on
which their juniors were promoted.
</p><p id="p_6">	 	6. Applying the dictum laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court and
the decision of this Court, the writ petition stands allowed with a direction to
the respondents to consider the claim of the petitioner for promotion to the
post of Forest Ranger for the panel of the year 2009-2010 irrespective of the
pendency of the charge under Rule 17(a) of TNCS (D&amp;A) Rules, if there are no
legal impediments. Such order shall be passed by the respondents, as
expeditiously as possible and in any event, within a period of six weeks from
the date of receipt of a copy of this order. No costs.  Consequently, connected
M.P.(MD) No.1 of 2010 is closed.
