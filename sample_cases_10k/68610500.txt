     THIS WRIT PETITION COMING ON FOR PRELIMINARY
HEARING, THIS DAY, THE COURT MADE THE FOLLOWING :



                         ORDER
</pre>

<p id="p_1">     Learned Government Advocate to accept notice for

respondents No.1 to 6.    He is permitted to file memo of

appearance in four weeks.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">     2.    The petitioner is before this Court seeking for a

direction to respondents No.2 to 6 herein not to insist

upon the petitioner-Club to obtain the licence for the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                               3</span>


cultural activities carried on by the petitioner in the club

premises as per the legal requirements.


</p><p id="p_4">     3.    The petitioner claims to be a recreational club

wherein the members of the club are permitted to play

games of recreation such as rummy, carrom, chess etc. It

is therefore the contention that no unlawful activity is

being carried on in the said premises.     The grievance of

the petitioner is that the respondents are insisting on the

petitioner to secure licence despite the same does not

require a licence.   The petitioner is therefore before this

Court.
</p>
<p id="p_5">
</p><p id="p_6">     4.    Having heard the learned counsel appearing

for the parties, it is to be noticed that several matters of

the like nature have arisen before this Court and this

Court has consistently taken the view that in respect of

the present nature of activities in a recreational club, the

same does not require licence.     Hence, the respondents

are not justified in insisting on the same. However, the

respondents would have the liberty of monitoring the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                4</span>


activities of the club and taking action only if there are

any illegal activities carried on in the premises.


</p><p id="p_7">          5.   In that view of the matter, the petition is

disposed of, with a direction to the respondents not to

insist on the petitioner to secure a licence in respect of the

activities stated to have been carried on by the petitioner.

However, it is made clear that the respondents would be

entitled to monitor the activities and take action, if the

petitioner indulges in any illegal activities in the club

premises.
</p>
<p id="p_8">          With the above observations, the petition stands

disposed of. No order as to costs.
