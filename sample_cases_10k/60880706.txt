     CORAM:
     HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE V.K. SHALI

     V.K. SHALI, J. (ORAL)
</pre>
<p id="p_1">     1.       I have heard the learned counsel for the appellant as well as

     the learned counsel for the respondent.
</p>
<p id="p_2">     2.       Vide order dated 20.03.2013, the following question was

     framed:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">                    "Whether the concurrent finding of fact
              arrived at by the two courts below with regard to
              the appellant being a licensee in the premises in
              question is substantiated by any evidence on record
              or not?"
</blockquote>


<blockquote id="blockquote_2">RSA 59/2013                                                           Page 1
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">      3.       Before dealing with the aforesaid question, it may be

     pertinent to give the brief background of the case.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_3">     4.       The respondent herein is a registered society under the

     <a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_1">Societies Registration Act</a>, 1860 and is running a temple known

     as Birla Mandir, Mandir Marg, New Delhi. A suit for possession

     and recovery of damages/mesne profits came to be filed on behalf

     of the respondent/society through one of its trustees who was duly

     authorized vide the resolution dated 15.03.2004. The allegation

     made by the respondent/society against the appellant herein was

     that the father of the appellant was allotted a shop purely on a

     licence basis for selling flowers and garlands on the periphery of

     the mandir on a monthly licence fee of `40. It was alleged that

     the licence fee of `40 was being reflected as bhaint/offering on

     the receipts issues to the father of the appellant. After the demise

     of the father of the appellant, the appellant continued to be in

     occupation of the premises in question in the capacity of the

     licensee and the licence fee was enhanced to `600/- per month in

     December, 2003. It was also alleged in the plaint that with effect

     from 01.01.2004, the licence fee was further enhanced to `1,000/-

     per month on a mutual understanding between the appellant and

RSA 59/2013                                                        Page 2
      the respondent apart from the payment of `20 per month by way

     of electricity charges but the said amount was never paid and

     since the appellant had run into arrears of payment of licence fee

     with effect from 01.01.2004, at the aforesaid rate of `1,000 per

     month, consequently the suit for possession and damages/mesne

     profits was filed against him.
</p>
<p id="p_4">     5.       The    present   appellant   defended   the   claim   of   the

     respondent/plaintiff. It was averred by him that he was a tenant in

     the suit premises just as his father was a tenant. It was stated that

     the amount of rent which was paid by him was reflected as an

     bhaint/offering by the respondent which is stated to have been

     done by the respondent only with a view to save the income tax

     liability.     It was further stated by the appellant that he was

     compelled to file a petition under <a href="/doc/1746765/" id="a_2">Section 45</a> of the Delhi Rent

     Control Act, 1958 on account of disruption of essential amenities

     by the respondent/plaintiff as well as a petition under <a href="/doc/1557153/" id="a_3">Section 27</a> of

     the Delhi Rent Control Act, 1958 depositing the rent in the court of

     ARC. On the completion of pleadings of the parties, the following

     issues were framed:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">          "1.      Whether the defendant is the licensee in
          the suit property? OPP.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">RSA 59/2013                                                          Page 3
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_6">           2.      Whether the suit of the plaintiff liable to
          be dismissed under <a href="/doc/9373/" id="a_4">Section 41(f)</a> (g) &amp; (h) of
          <a href="/doc/1671917/" id="a_5">Specific Relief Act</a>? OPD

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_7">          3.      Whether the plaintiff has any cause of
          action to file the present suit? OPD

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_8">          4.     Whether the plaintiff is entitled to decree
          of possession in respect of the suit property? OPP

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_9">          5.       Whether the plaintiff is entitled to mesne
          profit, if so at what rate and for what period? OPP

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_10">          6.      Whether the plaintiff is entitled to arrears
          of licence fee and arrears of electricity charges to
          the tune of `11,000/- and `1722/- respectively?
          OPP

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_11">          7.        Relief."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_5">     6.       Out of the above issues, the most important issue was as to

     whether the appellant/defendant was a licensee in the suit

     property in question. This issue has been decided by the trial court

     in favour of the respondent/plaintiff. The respondent/plaintiff in

     support of its case had filed an affidavit Ex.PW 1/A of Mr. Vinod

     Kumar Mishra who was subjected to extensive cross-examination

     on behalf of the appellant/plaintiff.     In the affidavit, the said

     witness had supported the case set up in the plaint by the

     respondent/plaintiff that the appellant/defendant was a licensee in

     respect of the property in question. It was also admitted by him
RSA 59/2013                                                         Page 4
      that there was no formal licence deed signed by the parties in this

     regard and the licence fee which was being paid by the appellant

     to the respondent was being reflected in the receipts as

     bhaint/offering and that at no point of time, the word „rent‟ was

     used in in any of the receipts issued to the appellant/defendant.

     The appellant/defendant filed his own affidavit refuting the claim

     of the respondent/plaintiff. He supported his statement by stating

     that he was a tenant in the property in question. The documents in

     this regard Ex.DW-1/PX-1, Ex.DW-1/PX-2 and Ex.DW-1/PX-3

     were admitted by him having his signatures at point A.         These

     documents show that the rate list of various items purported to

     have been sold by the appellant/defendant were got approved by

     him from the respondent/plaintiff.
</p>
<p id="p_6">     7.       The trial court accepted the plea of the respondent/plaintiff

     that the appellant was a licensee in respect of the shop in question

     on the basis of receipts having been produced. A reliance was

     placed in this regard on the documents admitted by the appellant

     in his cross examination with regard to the approval of the rate

     list.    It was a finding which was affirmed by the first appellate

     court as well.
</p>
<p id="p_7">
</p><p id="p_8">RSA 59/2013                                                          Page 5
</p><p id="p_9">      8.       The main contention of the learned counsel for the

     appellant is that there is no evidence on record to show that the

     appellant/defendant was a licensee in respect of the shop in

     question and the onus in respect of proving that the appellant was

     a tenant in the shop in question was wrongly put on him.

     Accordingly, the finding returned by the two courts below was

     irrational.
</p>
<p id="p_10">     9.       This court formulated a question after preliminary hearing

     only with regard to the concurrent finding having been returned

     by the two courts below as to whether the appellant was a licensee

     or not. The basic dictum of rule of evidence is that „one who

     asserts must prove‟. The respondent/plaintiff having filed a suit

     for possession and recovery of damages/mesne profits against the

     appellant claiming him to be a licensee in respect of the shop in

     question, was required to prove the same. The trial court had

     rightly framed an issue as to whether the appellant was a licensee

     in   the      shop   in   question   and   placed   onus   on    the

     respondent/plaintiff. This onus was discharged by the respondent

     by filing an affidavit of PW-1 Mr. Vinod Kumar Mishra who

     supported the averments made in the plaint that the appellant was


RSA 59/2013                                                          Page 6
      a licensee in the shop in question and the amount which was being

     paid by way of licence fee was being shown as bhaint/offering in

     the receipts. The onus having been discharged by the respondent,

     it shifted to the appellant to prove that he was not a licensee but a

     tenant. In this regard, no doubt he had made a statement in his

     affidavit exhibited as ExDW1/1 that he is a tenant and paying rent

     in respect of the shop in question, but one must not lose sight of

     the fact that in his cross-examination he has admitted the

     documents ExDW-1/PX-1, ExDW-1/PX-2 and ExDW-1/PX-3

     which show that the rates of the items sold by him at the shop in

     question   were    being   got   approved     by   him    from    the

     respondent/plaintiff.   If the appellant was a tenant in respect of

     the shop in question, then he would never have been required to

     get the rates approved from the respondent/plaintiff. The very

     fact that the rates were got approved, lends credence or

     corroboration to the case of the respondent that he was a licensee.

     In addition to this, it is also admitted by the appellant that the

     shop in question was being opened and closed according to the

     timings fixed by the respondent. That was another factor which

     shows that though the appellant may be in physical possession of


RSA 59/2013                                                           Page 7
      the shop in question, the nature of business, the rates of the items

     sold at the shop in question, the time of opening and closing of

     shop in question were all effectively being regulated by the

     respondent/plaintiff. This can only happen if a person who is in

     occupation is a licensee and not tenant. Accordingly, I feel that

     the concurrent finding returned by the two courts below was

     absolutely right that the appellant was a licensee and not the

     tenant.
</p>
<p id="p_11">     10.      The last submission which has been made by the learned

     counsel for the appellant is that he had filed an application under

     Order 41 Rule 27 CPC seeking permission to adduce additional

     evidence during the stage of appeal.          However, the said

     application has not been decided. The learned counsel for the

     respondent has refuted this contention of the learned counsel for

     the appellant that the application under Order 41 Rule 27 CPC has

     not been decided.
</p>
<p id="p_12">     11.      I have perused the record. The application under Order 41

     Rule 27 CPC of the appellant seeking permission to adduce

     additional evidence was rejected by the first appellate court on

     17.09.2012. The reason given for the rejection of the application


RSA 59/2013                                                        Page 8
      under Order 41 Rule 27 CPC by the first appellate court was that

     the said provision permits a party to adduce additional evidence

     by way of documents while as in instant case, the appellant in the

     application had not sought permission to place any documents on

     record, but had only urged that he may be permitted to prove the

     record of the income tax authorities in order to show that in the

     returns filed by the respondent/plaintiff, the amount of money

     which was being received by the respondent/plaintiff, was

     reflected as rent. The first appellate court had concluded that

     since no document along with the application had been placed on

     record, therefore, the application could not be allowed. In any

     case, the first appellate court had rejected the application by an

     independent order and if the appellant felt aggrieved by the said

     order, he could have assailed that order. Having chosen not to do

     so, it is not open to the appellant to now contend that the said

     application has not been decided by the first appellate court and,

     therefore, the concurrent finding returned by the two courts below

     is not sustainable.
</p>
<p id="p_13">     12.      In view of the aforesaid discussion, I am of the considered

     opinion that there is no infirmity in the concurrent finding


RSA 59/2013                                                         Page 9
      returned by the two courts below with regard to holding that the

     appellant was a licensee in respect of the shop in question.

</p><p id="p_14">     13.      Accordingly, the question which was framed by this court

     on 20.03.2013, is answered in the negative and the appeal is

     dismissed.</p><pre id="pre_2">
