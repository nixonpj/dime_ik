15/03.04.2013</pre><p id="p_1"> The petitioner by way of the present petition under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_1">Article 227</a> of the Constitution of
 India has prayed for issuance of an appropriate writ/order/direction for quashing and setting aside the
 orders dated 20th May, 2011, whereby the learned court below closed the evidence of the defendant
 no.2/petitioner and also the order dated 03rd September, 2011, whereby the petition to recall the order
 dated 20th May, 2011 was rejected in a Title Suit No. 278 of 2007.
</p><p id="p_2"> 2.     Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner as well as respondents.
</p><p id="p_3"> 3.     Perused the impugned order as well as other materials placed on record.
</p><p id="p_4"> 4.     It appears that the evidence of the petitioner/defendant no. 2 has been ordered to be closed by
 the court below on 20th May, 2011. Thereafter, the petitioner/defendant no. 2 submitted an application
 to recall the said order but the said application was also rejected by the court below on 03rd September,
 2011. The reason/justification given by the petitioner/defendant no. 2-Zila Parishad appears to be
 genuine as, Shri Ram Janam Singh, the learned Advocate representing the Zila Parishad in the court
 below met with an accident and remain confined to bed since 20th May, 2011 and was not in a position
 to attend the Court and therefore, the Zila Parishad was not in a position to proceed further with the
 case in the court below. Therefore, it appears that the court below has not properly considered the
 justification/explanation rendered by the petitioner/defendant no. 2 and thereby rejected the request
 made by the present petitioner/defendant no. 2.
</p><p id="p_5"> 5.     The learned counsel for the petitioner/defendant no. 2-Zila Parishad submitted that there are in
 all 9 witnesses to be examined and therefore, the defendant no. 2 will take further appropriate steps for
 examination of his witnesses on the date that may be fixed by the court below and will not ask for any
 unnecessary adjournment and will also co-operate in the court below in fair and expeditious trial.
</p><p id="p_6"> 6.     For the reasons stated in the present petition, the prayer with regard to quashing and setting
 aside the orders dated 20th May, 2011 and 03rd September, 2011 deserves to be allowed. Accordingly,
 both the orders dated 20th May, 2011 and 03rd September, 2011 are ordered to be quashed and set aside
 and the petitioner/defendant no. 2 is permitted to adduce his evidence in the court below and shall
 produce their witness on the date that may be fixed by the court below and shall not ask for any
 unnecessary adjournments and thereby co-operate in the proceedings. The court below shall also make
 endeavour for expeditious disposal of the suit.
