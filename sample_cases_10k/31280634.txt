can approach the Court either before or during the arbitration proceedings
or at any time after making of the award for interim injunction or
appointment of a Receiver. In that view of the matter, this Court is duly
empowered to appoint a Receiver in the present matter as there exists an
arbitration clause in the agreement between the parties.
7-          Accordingly, the petition is allowed and order dated
01.09.2011 passed earlier is made absolute. As the vehicle in question has
been repossessed and the arbitration proceedings in the matter have
