                Dated this the 20th November, 2008

<p id="p_1">       This petition is for bail.
</p>
<p id="p_2">       2.   The alleged offences are under Sections 143, 147,

148, 341, 326 and 307 read with <a href="/doc/999134/" id="a_1">Section 149</a> IPC. Petitioners

are accused nos.1, 2, 4, 5 and 6.                 According to prosecution,

petitioners along with other accused formed into an unlawful

assembly, armed with deadly weapons, assaulted the defacto

complainant, caused grievous hurt to him and also attempted to

commit murder.
</p>
<p id="p_3">       3.   Learned counsel for petitioners submitted that

petitioners were arrested on 4.10.2008 and they are in custody

for a long time. It is also submitted that right hand of fourth

accused was totally paralysed that too by the attack of defacto

complainant. Hence, it is not possible for him to commit offence,

it is submitted.
</p>
<p id="p_4">       4.   This petition is strongly opposed.                  Learned public

prosecutor submitted that petitioners are hired gundas. They

had committed the offence because of previous enmity.                     As

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">BA No.7075/2008                 2</span>



pointed out by learned public prosecutor, fourth accused was

attacked by defacto complainant and hence, he had a definite

motive to retaliate against defacto complainant. This group of

accused is known under the title, "quotation group". If they are

granted bail, it is likely that there will be further clashes.

Defacto complainant is a worker of BJP. Petitioners are involved

in a number of case of similar nature. They are likely to influence

or intimidate witnesses and in such case, investigation is likely to

be effected, it is submitted.
</p>
<p id="p_5">      5.   On hearing both sides, I am satisfied of the

submissions made by the learned public prosecutor and I am not

inclined to grant bail to the petitioners at this stage. If the

petitioners are released on bail, it will adversely affect the

investigation.
</p>
<p id="p_6">      The petition is dismissed.
</p>
