Background of the Lift Case

</p><p id="p_7">2. The present batch of four revision petitions arise from a common charge sheet

filed by the CBI in RC No. 25(A)/2003-CBI/ACB/New Delhi. This concerns the

unauthorised construction of a lift at a commercial complex at Mahavira

Crl.Rev.P.Nos.340/08, 371/08, 380/08, 456/08
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                                                          Page 2 of 61</span>
 Towers, IIIrd Floor, Paschim Vihar and is hereafter referred to as the `lift case‟.

The FIR in this case was registered on 3rd April 2003 under <a href="/doc/324254/" id="a_12">Sections 7</a>, <a href="/doc/1259316/" id="a_13">13(2)</a>

read with 13(1) (d) <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_14">PC Act</a>. In this case Subhash Sharma („Sharma‟), the former

Vice-Chairman of the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) is accused No.1,

Dharambir Khattar („Khattar‟) who allegedly worked as a middleman between

public servants and private individuals is accused No.2, Ved Prakash Kaushik

an individual and co-conspirator who helped in liaising with the DDA is

accused No.3, Pradeep Kapur husband of Kavita Kapur, a partner of a firm M/s

APY Hoteliers and Developers is accused No.4. Anil Wadhwa and Yashpal

Manocha, the other two partners of the said firm are accused Nos. 5 and 6

respectively. The gist of the case is that the accused acted in criminal conspiracy

to commit the aforementioned offences whereby Subhash Sharma used his

official position to prevent the demolition of the unauthorised construction of

the lift in the commercial complex and subsequently to get it authorized.




</p><p id="p_8">3. The charge sheet in the Lift Case was filed on 15th July 2004. According to

the CBI, the facts and evidence gathered during the investigation revealed

disclosed the commission by the accused of offences punishable under <a href="/doc/1897847/" id="a_15">Section

120B</a> IPC read with <a href="/doc/324254/" id="a_16">Sections 7</a>, <a href="/doc/733974/" id="a_17">8</a>, <a href="/doc/1259316/" id="a_18">13(2)</a> read with 13(1) (d) and <a href="/doc/1284521/" id="a_19">Section 15</a> of

PCA and substantive offences against some of them. By the impugned order on

charge dated 8th April 2008, after discussing the materials gathered by the CBI,

the learned Special Judge, CBI discharged accused Yashpal Manocha and held

that charges for the aforementioned offences should be framed against the

remaining accused. By the subsequent order dated 16th April 2008 the learned

Special Judge framed charges against each of the petitioners for the
Crl.Rev.P.Nos.340/08, 371/08, 380/08, 456/08
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                                                         Page 3 of 61</span>
 aforementioned offences.
</p>
<p id="p_9">4. The submissions of Mr.S.K.Rungta, learned Advocate on behalf of

Dharambir Khattar, Mr.S.K.Saxena, learned Advocate on behalf of Subhash

Sharma, Mr.H.P.Sharma, learned Advocate on behalf of Ved Prakash Sharma,

Ms.Neelam Grover, learned Advocate on behalf of Pradeep Kapur and Anil

Wadhwa and Mr.Dayan Krishnan, learned Special Public Prosecutor appearing

for CBI have been heard.
</p>
<p id="p_10">


Preliminary objection of the CBI as to maintainability

</p><p id="p_11">5. A preliminary objection has been raised by the CBI about the maintainability

of these revision petitions. It is submitted that in terms of <a href="/doc/97670/" id="a_20">Section 19</a> (3) (c) of

PCA, no Court can exercise the powers of revision in relation to any

interlocutory order passed in any inquiry, trial, appeal or other proceedings by

the trial court. It is submitted that an order holding that charges are required to

be framed against the accused and an order framing charges passed by the

Special Court under the PCA are interlocutory orders against which no revision

would lie to the High Court.
</p>
<p id="p_12">


</p><p id="p_13">6. It is submitted that that while interpreting a similarly worded provision, viz.,

<a href="/doc/775070/" id="a_21">Section 11(1)</a> of the Special Courts Act 1979 (SCA), a Bench of four Judges of

Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/920829/" id="a_22">V.C.Shukla v. CBI</a> (1980) Supp SCC 92 by a 3:1 majority

held that an order framing charges against the accused was not a final order but

an interlocutory one and, therefore, no appeal would lie against such order to the

Supreme Court. A comparison is also drawn with a similarly worded provision,
Crl.Rev.P.Nos.340/08, 371/08, 380/08, 456/08
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                                                         Page 4 of 61</span>
 <a href="/doc/1718438/" id="a_23">Section 34</a> of the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2002 (POTA) which was

interpreted in <a href="/doc/1769219/" id="a_24">State v. Navjot Sandhu</a> (2003) 6 SCC 641 by the Supreme Court.

It was held that in terms of the said provision an interlocutory order of the

Special Court was not appealable to the High Court. It was further held that the

High Court could also not exercise its powers under Articles 226 and 227 of the

Constitution of India or <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_25">Section 482</a> CrPC to entertain a petition challenging an

interlocutory order of the Special Court under the POTA.




</p><p id="p_14">7. According to learned counsel for the CBI, the opening words of <a href="/doc/99172794/" id="a_26">Section 19(3)</a>

PCA indicate that it is a non-obstante clause and, therefore resort cannot be had

to either the <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_27">CrPC</a> or <a href="/doc/889478/" id="a_28">Section 22</a> or <a href="/doc/132358254/" id="a_29">Section 27</a> of the PCA to justify the High

Court entertaining a revision petition. He places reliance on the decision of the

Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/1689510/" id="a_30">Satya Narayan Sharma v. State of Rajasthan</a> (2001) 8 SCC

607 where in the context of a stay order passed by the Special Court under the

PCA, the scope of <a href="/doc/97670/" id="a_31">Section 19</a> (3) (c) was explained and it was held that no stay

of the proceedings before the Special Court could be granted even by the High

Court by virtue of the said provision. Reliance is also upon the judgment of a

Division Bench of this Court in <a href="/doc/1407970/" id="a_32">Bachraj Bengani v. State</a> 110(2004) DLT 233

where it was held that an appeal could not be filed in terms of <a href="/doc/1718438/" id="a_33">Section 34</a> POTA

against an order framing charges. It was held that even a revision petition would

not lie in the High Court.
</p>
<p id="p_15">
Submissions of the petitioners on maintainability
</p><p id="p_16">8. The submissions of the learned counsel for the CBI have been countered by

learned counsel for the petitioners accused not only in the present batch of cases

Crl.Rev.P.Nos.340/08, 371/08, 380/08, 456/08
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                                                        Page 5 of 61</span>
 but also by counsel who appeared in the connected batch of cases which were

heard along with the present case. While arguments in the lift case were

addressed both on the issues of maintainability as well as on merits, the

arguments in the connected cases were addressed only on the issue of

</p><p id="p_18">9. Learned counsel for the accused submit that the judgment in V.C.Shukla

(supra) has no application to the present cases since it was rendered in the

context of Section 11 SCA which is not, according to them, in pari materia

<a href="/doc/97670/" id="a_34">Section 19</a> (3) (c) PCA. Likewise, it is submitted that the wording of <a href="/doc/1718438/" id="a_35">Section 34</a>

POTA is different. It bars appeals and revisions against interlocutory orders as

understood in the context of the POTA. It is submitted that as far as the PCA is

concerned, <a href="/doc/1734018/" id="a_36">Section 19</a> deals essentially with the grant of sanction to prosecute

and the remedy available to a person aggrieved by an order granting sanction.

Thus, the scope of <a href="/doc/1734018/" id="a_37">Section 19</a> (3) (c) PCA cannot be expanded to cover all

orders passed by the trial court at the various stages of the trial. Referring to

<a href="/doc/61176913/" id="a_38">Section 22</a> and <a href="/doc/132358254/" id="a_39">27</a> of the PCA, it is submitted that each of these provisions has

to be given full effect and the revision petition is, therefore, maintainable

against an order on charge or an order framing charges passed by the Special

</p><p id="p_40">12. A bare perusal of the above provisions reveals their apparent similarity.

While Section 11 SCA and <a href="/doc/1718438/" id="a_58">Section 34</a> POTA bar appeals against an

interlocutory order of the trial court, <a href="/doc/1734018/" id="a_59">Section 19</a> (3) (c) PCA prohibits the

entertaining of revision petitions by the High Court against interlocutory orders

of the Special Court. The second similarity is that each of the provisions begins

with the non obstante clause „Notwithstanding anything contained in<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_60"> the Code</a>

of Criminal Procedure.‟ Clearly the said provision will prevail over any contrary

or inconsistent provision in the <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_61">CrPC</a>. A look at <a href="/doc/132358254/" id="a_62">Section 27</a> PCA shows that it is

a provision concerning the revisional power of the High Court and it has been

made „subject to the other provisions of the Act‟. Therefore <a href="/doc/132358254/" id="a_63">Section 27</a> PCA is

subject to <a href="/doc/99172794/" id="a_64">Section 19</a> (3) PCA which in turn is unaffected by any contrary

provision in the <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_65">CrPC</a>. The third similarity is that in none of the statutes is there

a definition of the words `interlocutory order.‟ The said words are not defined
Crl.Rev.P.Nos.340/08, 371/08, 380/08, 456/08
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                                                           Page 9 of 61</span>
 even under the <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_66">CrPC</a>. This Court is therefore unable to accept the submission of

the learned counsel for the accused that Section 11 SCA and <a href="/doc/1718438/" id="a_67">Section 34</a> POTA

are not in pari materia <a href="/doc/99172794/" id="a_68">Section 19</a> (3) PCA.
</p>
<p id="p_41">

Is the order on charge and an order framing charge under the PCA an
interlocutory order?
</p><p id="p_42">13. The principal question that arises in the context of the preliminary objection

is whether in terms of <a href="/doc/99172794/" id="a_69">Section 19</a> (3) (c) PCA, an order on charge and an order

framing charge is an interlocutory order? In V.C.Shukla the Supreme Court was

called upon to answer a similar question in the context of a similarly worded

Section 11 SCA. Under the SCA the trial court was a Special Court presided

over by a Judge of the High Court. The question was whether an appeal would

lie to the Supreme Court against an order framing charge passed by the Special

Court under the SCA. The question was answered in the negative by a 3:1

majority, with Fazl Ali J., writing the majority opinion for himself and Sen. J.

with Desai J. writing a separate concurring opinion. Singhal, J. dissented.




</p><p id="p_43">14. The sheet anchor of the argument on behalf of the appellant in V.C.Shukla

was that the SCA "being a statute in pari materia<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_70"> the Criminal Procedure Code</a>,

the expression used and the meaning of the words employed in the Act must

have the same meaning and signification as used in the various provisions<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_71"> of the

Criminal Procedure Code</a> of 1973..." It was further submitted in that case, as it

is here, that "on a proper construction of <a href="/doc/1763700/" id="a_72">Section 11</a> of the Act, the word

„interlocutory order‟ has been used exactly in the same sense as the same word

has been used in <a href="/doc/1846048/" id="a_73">Section 397(2)</a> of the Code." Fazl Ali, J. for the majority (with

 Desai, J. concurring) first went on to discuss the decisions in <a href="/doc/1546207/" id="a_74">Amar Nath v.

State of Haryana</a> (1977) 4 SCC 137, <a href="/doc/646292/" id="a_75">Madhu Limaye v. State of Maharashtra</a>

(1977) 4 SCC 551 and <a href="/doc/1169022/" id="a_76">S. Kuupuswami Rao v. King</a> AIR 1949 FC 1 and

observed that (SCC, p.104): "the term „interlocutory order‟ used in<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_77"> the Code</a> of

Criminal Procedure has to be given a very liberal construction in favour of the

accused in order to ensure complete fairness of the trial because the bar

contained in <a href="/doc/23396/" id="a_78">Section 397(3)</a> of the Code would apply to a variety of cases

coming up before the courts not only being offences under<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_79"> the Penal Code</a> but

under numerous Acts" and that "the revisional power of the High Court or the

Sessions Judge could be attracted if the order was not purely interlocutory but

intermediate or quasi-final." However, it qualified this by saying: "The same,

however, in our opinion, could not be said of the <a href="/doc/701797/" id="a_80">Special Courts Act</a> which was

meant to cover only specified number of crimes and criminals and the objective

attained was quickest despatch and speediest disposal." The majority then

observed (SCC, p.106):
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">        "we are in complete agreement with the principle, involved in the cases
        discussed above, that an order framing charges against an accused
        undoubtedly decides an important aspect of the trial and it is the duty of
        the court to apply its judicial mind to the materials and come to a clear
        conclusion that a prima facie case has been made out on the basis of
        which it would be justified in framing charges. The question, however,
        with which we are concerned in the present appeal is essentially different.</blockquote><p id="p_44">
</p><p id="p_45">        The order of the Special Judge framing the charge is a reasoned order and
        not a mechanical or a casual order so as to vitiate the order of the Special
        Judge. In the instant case, we are concerned with a much larger question
        viz. whether or not the term "interlocutory order" used in <a href="/doc/101749505/" id="a_81">Section 11(1)</a> of
        the Act should be given the same meaning as this very term appearing in
        <a href="/doc/1846048/" id="a_82">Section 397(2)</a> of the Code. In other words, the question is whether
Crl.Rev.P.Nos.340/08, 371/08, 380/08, 456/08
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                                                         Page 11 of 61</span>
         <a href="/doc/101749505/" id="a_83">Section 11(1)</a> of the Act tightens or widens the scope of the term
        "interlocutory order" as contained in <a href="/doc/1846048/" id="a_84">Section 397(2)</a> of the Code and
        as interpreted by this Court in the decisions, referred to above."
        (emphasis supplied)

</p><p id="p_46">15. While dealing with the said question, the objects of the SCA were examined

and it was concluded that (SCC, p. 111):
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">    "the heart and soul of the Act is speedy disposal and quick dispatch in the
    trial of these cases. It is, therefore, manifest that the provisions of the Act
    must be interpreted so as to eliminate all possible avenues of delay or means
    of adopting dilatory tactics by plugging every possible loophole in the Act
    through which the disposal of the case may be delayed. Indeed if this be the
    avowed object of the Act, could it have been intended by the Parliament that
    while<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_85"> the Criminal Procedure Code</a> gives a right of revision against an order
    which, though not purely interlocutory, is either intermediate or quasi-final,
    the Act would provide a full-fledged appeal against such an order. If the
    interpretation as suggested by the counsel for the appellant is accepted, the
    result would be that this Court would be flooded with appeals against the
    order of the Special Court framing charges which will impede the progress of
    the trial and delay the disposal of the case which is against the very spirit of
    the Act. We are of the opinion that it was for this purpose that a non obstante
    clause was put in <a href="/doc/1763700/" id="a_86">Section 11</a> of the Act so as to bar appeals against any
    interlocutory order whether it is of an intermediate nature or is quasi-final.
    <a href="/doc/374796/" id="a_87">The Act</a> applies only to specified number of cases which fulfil the conditions
    contained in the provisions of the Act and in view of its special features, the
    liberty of the subject has been fully safeguarded by providing a three-tier
    system as indicated above."
</blockquote>


<p id="p_47">16. Next, the law on the effect of the non obstante clause in Section11 SCA,

"notwithstanding anything in<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_88"> the Code</a>.." was analysed. The judgment of the

Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/350457/" id="a_89">Aswini Kumar Ghosh v. Arabinda Bose</a> AIR 1952 SC 369


Crl.Rev.P.Nos.340/08, 371/08, 380/08, 456/08
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                                                                         Page 12 of 61</span>
 and in particular the following opinion of Patanjali Sastri, CJ was noticed (SCC,

p. 113):
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">        "(1) We should exclude the statute concerned from consideration; in the
        instant case „The Code‟.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_7">        (2) We should construe the words used according to their natural and
        ordinary meaning instead of referring to the statute which is sought to be
        excluded."
</blockquote>


<p id="p_48">17. Next, the interpretation of the words "interlocutory order" independent of

the interpretation of those words in the context of <a href="/doc/1457888/" id="a_90">Section 397</a> CrPC, was taken

up. In doing so it was noticed that there was a species of an "intermediate

order." It was observed in para 24 (SCC, p.115):
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_8">        "the essential attribute of an interlocutory order is that it merely decides
        some point or matter essential to the progress of the suit or collateral to
        the issues sought but not a final decision or judgment on the matter in
        issue. An intermediate order is one which is made between the
        commencement of an action and the entry of the judgment. Untwalia, J. in
        the case of <a href="/doc/646292/" id="a_91">Madhu Limaye v. State of Maharashtra</a> clearly meant to
        convey that an order framing charge is not an interlocutory order but is an
        intermediate order as defined in the passage, extracted above, in
        CORPUS JURIS SECUNDUM, Vol. 60. We find ourselves in complete
        agreement with the observations made in CORPUS JURIS SECUNDUM.
        It is obvious that an order framing of the charge being an intermediate
        order falls squarely within the ordinary and natural meaning of the term
        "interlocutory order" as used in <a href="/doc/101749505/" id="a_92">Section 11(1)</a> of the Act. WHARTON'S
        LAW LEXICON (14th Edn., p. 529) defines interlocutory order thus:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_9">            "An interlocutory order or judgment is one made or given during the
              progress of an action, but which does not finally dispose of the
              rights of the parties."
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_10">        Thus, summing up the natural and logical meaning of an

Crl.Rev.P.Nos.340/08, 371/08, 380/08, 456/08
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                                                                         Page 13 of 61</span>
         interlocutory order, the conclusion is inescapable that an order which
        does not terminate the proceedings or finally decides the rights of the
        parties is only an interlocutory order. In other words, in ordinary
        sense of the term, an interlocutory order is one which only decides a
        particular aspect or a particular issue or a particular matter in a
        proceeding, suit or trial but which does not however conclude the
        trial at all. This would be the result if the term interlocutory order is
        interpreted in its natural and logical sense without having resort to<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_93">
        Criminal Procedure Code</a> or any other statute." (emphasis supplied)



</blockquote><p id="p_49">18. In para 34 of the majority opinion of Fazl Ali, J., the following propositions

were laid down on determining whether an order is an interlocutory or a final

order SCC, p.122):
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_11">        "34. Thus, on a consideration of the authorities, mentioned above,
        the following propositions emerge:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_12">        (1) that an order which does not determine the right of the parties
        but only one aspect of the suit or the trial is an interlocutory
        order;
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_13">        (2) that the concept of interlocutory order has to be explained in
        contradistinction to a final order. In other words, if an order is

</p><p id="p_53">19. Applying the above tests it was held in Para 35 as under (SCC, p.123):

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_15">        "Applying these tests to the order impugned we find that the
        order framing the charges is purely an interlocutory order as
        it does not terminate the proceedings but the trial goes on
        until it culminates in acquittal or conviction. It is true that if
        the Special Court would have refused to frame charges and
        discharged the accused, the proceedings would have terminated
        but that is only one side of the picture. The other side of the
        picture is that if the Special Court refused to discharge the
        accused and framed charges against him, then the order would be
        interlocutory because the trial would still be alive. Mr. Mridul
        tried to repel the argument of the Solicitor-General and explained
        the decisions, referred to above, on the ground that the English
        decisions as also the Federal Court‟s decisions made the
        observations while interpreting the provisions of the Government
        of India expressly used. It was urged that the same construction
        would not apply to the present case where the word `order‟ is not
        qualified by the word `final‟. With due respect to the learned
        counsel, in our opinion, the distinction sought to be drawn is a

         distinction without any difference. This Court as also the Federal
        Court have clearly pointed out that so far as the tests to be applied
        to determine whether an order is final or interlocutory, apply as
        much to a civil case as to a criminal case.        Furthermore, as
        already indicated, it is impossible to spell out the concept of an
        interlocutory order unless it is held in contradistinction to or in
        contrast with a final order. This was held in a number of cases a
        number of cases referred to, including Madhu Limaye case which
        has been expressly stressed by us in an earlier part of the
        judgment. For these reasons, therefore, the contention of the
        learned counsel for the appellant on this aspect of the matter fails
        and is hereby overruled." (emphasis supplied)

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_16">        "45. On a true construction of <a href="/doc/101749505/" id="a_96">Section 11(1)</a> of the Act and
        taking into consideration the natural meaning of the expression
        `interlocutory order‟, there can be no doubt that the order framing
        charges against the appellant under the Act was merely an
        interlocutory order which neither terminated the proceedings nor
        finally decided the rights of the parties. According to the test laid
        down in Kuppuswami case the order impugned was undoubtedly
        an interlocutory order. Taking into consideration, therefore,
        the natural meaning of interlocutory order and applying the
        non obstante clause, the position is that the provisions<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_97"> of the
        Code</a> of Criminal Procedure are expressly excluded by the
        non obstante clause and therefore <a href="/doc/1846048/" id="a_98">Section 397(2)</a> of the Code
        cannot be called into aid in order to hold that the order
        impugned is not an interlocutory order. As the decisions of

        and <a href="/doc/1546207/" id="a_99">Amar Nath v. State of Haryana</a> were given with respect to the

<blockquote id="blockquote_17">        46. We feel that one reason why no appeal was provided against
        an interlocutory order like framing of the charges, as construed by
        us so far as the Act is concerned, may have been that it would be
        against the dignity and decorum of the very high status which the
        Special Judge under the Act enjoys in trying the case against an
        accused in that the Judge is a Sitting Judge of a High Court and
        therefore must be presumed to frame the charges only after
        considering the various principles and guide-lines laid down by
        other High Courts and this Court in some of the cases referred to
        above.

<blockquote id="blockquote_18">        47.     Thus, summing up the entire position the inescapable
        conclusion that we reach is that given the expression
        `interlocutory order' its natural meaning according to the
        tests laid down, as discussed above, particularly in
        Kuppuswami case and applying the non obstante clause, we
        are satisfied that the Act is concerned, it has been used in the

        the Code</a> in <a href="/doc/374796/" id="a_104">Section 397(2)</a>. The view taken by us appears to be
        in complete consonance with the avowed object of the Act to
        provide for a most expeditious trial and quick dispatch of the case
        tried by the Special Court, which appears to be the paramount

an order framing charge "would not be an order other than an interlocutory

</p><p id="p_56"> 22. Coming to the present case, this Court has no hesitation in holding that the

ruling in V.C.Shukla in the context of the words „interlocutory order‟ in Section

11 SCA would apply on all fours. As already noticed, there is very little

distinction between Section 11 SCA and <a href="/doc/99172794/" id="a_105">Section 19</a> (3) (c) PCA. The opening

words of <a href="/doc/99172794/" id="a_106">Section 19</a> (3), like Section 11 SCA, constitutes a non obstante clause

that keeps out the <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_107">CrPC</a> entirely. It evidences the legislative intent not to permit

a revision petition against interlocutory orders passed by the Special Court

notwithstanding the position to the contrary under the <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_108">CrPC</a>. When the

legislature expressly excludes the applicability of the <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_109">CrPC</a> by a non obstante

clause, it would not be possible for a Court to overlook it and examine whether

the order on charge is in the context of <a href="/doc/1457888/" id="a_110">Section 397</a> CrPC an order that is subject

to revision. In other words, if one were to accept the arguments of learned

counsel for the accused, then the non obstante portion of <a href="/doc/99172794/" id="a_111">Section 19</a> (3) of the

PCA would be rendered redundant. It must be remembered that this is not a

petition challenging constitutional validity of <a href="/doc/99172794/" id="a_112">Section 19</a> (3) of the PCA. On the

other hand the petitioners are only seeking to interpret <a href="/doc/99172794/" id="a_113">Section 19</a> (3) (c) PCA to

permit a revision petition against an order on charge by the Special Court.

Rajasthan</a>(2001) 8 SCC 607. There the Court was concerned with the question

 notwithstanding <a href="/doc/99172794/" id="a_117">Section 19</a> (3) (c) of the Act. An argument was advanced by

the accused in that case that <a href="/doc/99172794/" id="a_118">Section 19</a> (3) (c) PCA which reads "no court shall

stay the proceedings under this Act on any other ground" would apply only to

proceedings concerning grant of sanction and not to an order granting stay of

the trial itself. It was further argued that the prohibition under <a href="/doc/99172794/" id="a_119">Section 19</a> (3) (c)

applied only to the revisional powers of the High Court under <a href="/doc/1457888/" id="a_120">Section 397</a> CrPC

and not to the powers of the High Court under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_121">Section 482</a> CrPC. These

arguments were negatived by the Supreme Court. A reference was made to

<a href="/doc/1457888/" id="a_122">Section 397</a> CrPC as well as to the non obstante clause. It was explained, thus,

in Para 14 of the said judgment (SCC, pp.612-613):
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_19">        "It is thus to be seen that this section provides:

        ground, and
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_21">        (b) that no court shall exercise the powers of revision in relation to any
        interlocutory order passed in any inquiry, trial, appeal or other
        proceedings.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_22">        To be noted that (b) above is identical to <a href="/doc/1846048/" id="a_123">Section 397(2)</a> of the
        Criminal Procedure Code which deals with the revisional power
        of the court. If <a href="/doc/99172794/" id="a_124">Section 19</a> was only to deal with revisional
        powers then the portion set out in (b) above, would have been
        sufficient. The legislature has, therefore, by adding the works
        "no court shall stay the proceedings under this Act on any other
        ground" clearly indicated that no stay could be granted by use of
        any power on any ground. This therefore would apply even when
        a court is exercising inherent jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_125">Section 482</a> of the
        Criminal Procedure Code."

and <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_128">Section 482</a> CrPC remained untramelled. In other words, it was submitted

that in appropriate cases, the said provisions could be invoked notwithstanding

the statutory bar to challenge an order on revision passed by the Special Court.

In the considered view of this Court, this argument although attractive also does

not survive after the authoritative pronouncement of the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/1769219/" id="a_129">State

v. Navjot Sandhu</a> (supra). There a similar argument raised in the context of

<a href="/doc/1718438/" id="a_130">Section 34</a> POTA was negatived. An order by the Special Judge POTA

regarding call interception was challenged in the High Court by a petition under

Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution read with <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_131">Section 482</a> CrPC. The

Supreme Court held that the High Court ought not to have entertained the

petition at all. It noticed the judgments in Madhu Limaye v. State of

Maharasthra and <a href="/doc/1689510/" id="a_132">Satya Narayan Sharma v. State of Rajasthan</a>. It was held

(SCC, p.657):

        under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_134">Section 482</a> of the Criminal Procedure Code can be exercised even
        when there is a bar under <a href="/doc/1778/" id="a_135">Section 397</a> or some other provisions<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_136"> of the

        some other enactment. If the order assailed is purely of an interlocutory
        character, which could be corrected in exercise of revisional powers or
        appellate powers the High Court must refuse to exercise its inherent
        power. The inherent power is to be used only in cases where there is an
        abuse of the process of the court or where interference is absolutely
        necessary for securing the ends of justice. The inherent power must be
        exercised very sparingly as cases which require interference would be
        few and far between. The most common case where inherent jurisdiction

        quashed because they are initiated illegally, vexatiously or without
        jurisdiction. Most of the cases set out hereinabove fall in this category. It
        must be remembered that the inherent power is not to be resorted to if
        there is a specific provision in<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_137"> the Code</a> or any other enactment for

        against an express bar in some other enactment."

<p id="p_59">25. In Satya Narayan Sharma too a similar argument was rejected. There the

        inherent jurisdiction cannot be exercised to get over that bar. As

Statement of Objects and Reasons of the PCA in which it was explained that:

"In order to expedite the proceedings, provisions for day-to-day trial of cases

and prohibitory provisions with regard to grant of stay and exercise of powers of

revision on interlocutory orders have also been included." This completely

answers the argument advanced on behalf of the petitioner Jagdish Chandra in

the connected batch of petitions that <a href="/doc/99172794/" id="a_152">Section 19</a> PCA was to be viewed only in

the context of an order granting or refusing sanction as its heading indicates. In

other words, merely because the heading of <a href="/doc/99172794/" id="a_153">Section 19</a> says "previous sanction

necessary for prosecution,‟ it cannot be understood as permitting revision

petitions to be filed against an order on charge. The scope of <a href="/doc/99172794/" id="a_154">Section 19</a> (3) (c)

does not get limited on account of the heading of the Section.

<a href="/doc/132358254/" id="a_155">Section 27</a> PCA certain orders of the trial court which could be challenged by

way of a revision petition in the High Court. For instance, an order discharging

an accused would be finally determinative of the culpability of the accused.

Such an order cannot be construed to be an interlocutory order. In this context,

it may be recalled that in V.C.Shukla the Supreme Court observed: "that an

order passed by the Special Court discharging the accused would undoubtedly

be a final order inasmuch as it finally decides the rights of the parties and puts

an end to the controversy and thereby terminates the entire proceedings before

of this Act...." Clearly, therefore, <a href="/doc/132358254/" id="a_157">Section 27</a> PCA would be subject to <a href="/doc/99172794/" id="a_158">Section

subject to certain modifications. <a href="/doc/61176913/" id="a_161">Section 22</a> (d) PCA reads as under:

been incorporated in <a href="/doc/61176913/" id="a_163">Section 22</a> does not really throw light on whether an order

on charge would be an interlocutory order for the purposes of <a href="/doc/99172794/" id="a_164">Section 19</a> (3) (c)

PCA. A collective reading of the two provisions indicates that in the context of

order on charge an order discharging the accused may be an order that would be

subject-matter of a revision petition at the instance perhaps of the prosecution.

Since all provisions of the statute have to be given meaning, a harmonious

construction of the three provisions indicates that the kinds of orders which can

be challenged by way of a revision petition in the High Court is narrowed down

to a considerable extent as explained in the case of Satya Narayan Sharma. The

overall objective of the PCA is to ensure that multifarious challenges at various

stages which have the effect of slowing down the trial itself should not be

permitted.

</p><p id="p_70">30. The judgment of the Full Bench of the Rajasthan High Court in Jarnail

Singh (supra), referred to by the counsel for the petitioners, was rendered in the

context of maintainability of a revision petition before the High Court against an

order framing charges passed by the trial court. It was not a case under the

PCA. The question referred for consideration by the Full Bench was "whether

under <a href="/doc/1457888/" id="a_165">Section 397</a> of the CrPC the expression „interlocutory order‟ covers the

framing of charge during the trial or not." It was in that context that the Full

Bench of Rajasthan High Court distinguished the judgment in V.C.Shukla to

hold that an order on charge in the context of <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_166">CrPC</a> would not be an

interlocutory order and can be subject-matter of a revision petition under

present cases is whether <a href="/doc/99172794/" id="a_168">Section 19</a> (3) (c) excludes the applicability of the

<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_169">CrPC</a>. In the considered view of this Court, it does.
</p>
<p id="p_71">


</p><p id="p_72">31. The learned Single Judge of the Madras High Court held in State v. Mrs.

Renukadevi 1999 Cri LJ 2955, that an interlocutory order under the PCA is not

to be confused with an intermediate order which can be passed during the

course of trial or inquiry. Unfortunately even though the attention of the Court

was drawn to the decision in V.C.Shukla, there is no discussion in the entire

judgment of the said. The Court therefore also did not notice the similarity

between <a href="/doc/99172794/" id="a_170">Section 19</a> (3) (c) PCA and Section 11 SCA. A month later the same

learned Single Judge of the Madras High Court delivered the judgment in <a href="/doc/21767/" id="a_171">V.R.

Nedunchezhian v. State</a> (supra). This time the learned Judge quoted a passage

from the judgment in V.C.Shukla (supra) but merely observed that the said

interpretation was given by the Supreme Court in the context of the object of the

SCA. The learned Single Judge again failed to notice the similarity in the

wording of Section 11 SCA with <a href="/doc/99172794/" id="a_172">Section 19</a> (3) PCA. Instead after referring to

the decision in Madhu Limaye it was concluded by the learned Single Judge

that an order on charge under the PCA cannot be held to be an interlocutory

order. With respect to the learned Single Judge, the judgment in

<a href="/doc/21767/" id="a_173">V.R.Nedunchezhian v. State</a> is contrary to V.C.Shukla in terms of which the

words `interlocutory order‟ in <a href="/doc/99172794/" id="a_174">Section 19</a> (3) (c) would include an order on

charge and an order framing charge. In the considered view of this Court, the

said two judgments of the learned Single Judge of the Madras High Court

therefore do not help the petitioners.

</p><p id="p_74"> 32. To conclude this part of the discussion it is held that in the context of

<a href="/doc/99172794/" id="a_175">Section 19</a> (3) (c) the words "no Court shall exercise the powers of revision in

relation to any interlocutory order passed in any inquiry, trial ........." includes

an interlocutory order in the form of an order on charge or an order framing

charge. On a collective reading of the decisions in V.C.Shukla and Satya

Narayan Sharma, it is held that in terms of <a href="/doc/99172794/" id="a_176">Section 19</a> (3) (c) PCA, no revision

petition would be maintainable in the High Court against order on charge or an

order framing charge passed by the Special Court.
</p>
<p id="p_75">33. Therefore, in the considered view of this Court, the preliminary objection of

the CBI to the maintainability of the present petitions is required to be upheld.

Nevertheless, this Court proposes to discuss the submissions in the Lift Case on

merits as well since it was argued at length.

Case of the prosecution

34.1 The case of the CBI is that Anil Wadhwa, Yashpal Manocha and Kavita

Kapur, wife of co-accused Pradeep Kapur entered into a partnership agreement

for undertaking the business of running hotels and restaurants in the name of

M/s A.P.Y.Hoteliers &amp; Developers. The principal place of business was 756,

CA Apartments, Paschim Vihar, Delhi. The said firm took on licence basis an

office space no.RMTT-30A on the third floor (above the 2nd floor and below the

terrace) of Rajendra Mahavira Tower-II situated on Plot Nos.32 and 33,

Community Centre, A-Block, Paschim Vihar, New Delhi -110 063 from M/s

Jaina Properties &amp; Finance Ltd. and others.

 34.2 As per the terms of the licence deed, the total monthly rent was Rs.32,500/-

and the deed was valid for 33 months. It appears that even at the time of

executing the licence deed, it was acknowledged that the licencee proposed to

erect a lift. This is evident from the following clause in the Licence Deed dated

which reads as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_30">        "The Licensor had already clarified that there was no permission
        for the lift to be installed at any place in the building, from any
        Authority whatsoever. Therefore, in case the Licencee desires to
        install and operate a lift as mentioned above, for the use of the
        premises being licenced, in that event, the Licencee should be
        solely       responsible          to     procure    all    the     requisite
        permission/sanctions/NOC‟s etc. at its own risks and costs and
        should always keep the Licensor and the Owner/Builder harmless
        and indemnified in his respect. All expenses incurred for the
        installation/operation/maintenance of the said lift or arising out of
        the installation/operation of the said lift, should be borne
        exclusively by the Licencee only. ............The Licencee should
        also     ensure       that     no      area   belonging   to     any    third
        party/owner/builder             is     used   for   installing    the    said
        lift..........."
</blockquote>


<p id="p_78">34.3 As per terms of the licence deed, the licencee was also not entitled

to carry out any addition, alteration or construction in the premises. The

licencee also agreed "not to encroach on any common passages, public

corridors and the terrace."

 November, 2002 with EISA Lifts Pvt. Ltd. for the purpose of erecting the lift at

the cost of Rs.6.70 lakhs and an advance amount of Rs.30,000/- was given to

EISA Lifts Pvt. Ltd. by cheque dated 2nd November, 2002. According to the

CBI, in April 2003 a further sum of Rs.2.50 lakhs was paid. In the second week

of December 2002, M/s A.P.Y.Hoteliers &amp; Developers commenced construction

work for the installation of the lift. The structural and unit work i.e. fabrication

and erection of M.S. lift well which comprised of work up to the platform level

excluding platform machinery was given to M/s Engineers and Contractors.

The videography and photographs taken by the CBI on site in April 2003

revealed the existence of a lift structure erected on the pavement adjacent to Plot

No.32-33, Paschim Vihar, Delhi.
</p>
<p id="p_80">


34.5 It appears that on 14th December, 2002, soon after the work on the

construction of the lift commenced, a complaint was made to the SHO, Police

Station Paschim Vihar by M/s Surya Estates Pvt. Ltd. having its office at 30 &amp;

31, Community Centre, Paschim Vihar, New Delhi.              A copy of the said

complaint was also endorsed to the Vice Chairman, Delhi Development

complaint the Officer on Special Duty (OSD) to the Vice Chairman, DDA

marked the complaint to the Director (Buildings) (DDA) on 17 th December,

2002. An inspection of the site was undertaken by the DDA Officials on 23 rd

34.6 In terms of Section 31 of the Delhi Development Authority Act (DD Act),

action was initiated and a `stop construction notice‟ was issued by the DDA on

3rd January, 2003. A copy of the said notice was pasted on the building of M/s

Jaina Properties (P) Ltd. on 8th January, 2003. It must be mentioned at this stage

that the interception of the calls on the phones used by the accused Subhash

Sharma, Vice-Chairman DDA, commenced on 20th December 2002. The first

call to be intercepted, as regards the lift case, was on 14th February, 2003.




34.7 After receipt of the report by the Director (Commercial Land) (CL) along

with photographs, the matter was discussed by Subhash Sharma, with the

Director (Building) and the Director (CL) on 4th and 6th February, 2003. An

order was passed on 6th February, 2003 by Subhash Sharma for removal of the

encroachment. Thereafter the file was sent to the Land Management (LM)

Section when the Deputy Director (DDA) (LM) and his officers took a decision

on 13th February, 2003 that the demolition should be carried out on 27th

February, 2003.
</p>
<p id="p_84">
34.8 When M/s A.P.Y.Hoteliers &amp; Developers learnt in the second week of

February 2003 of the proposed demolition, they discussed the matter with one

Ved Prakash Kaushik, a co-accused, who was also known as `Panditji‟. Panditji

claimed that he knew Subhash Sharma and that he could help them. According

to the CBI, although Panditji was an employee of the NDMC, he knew Subhash

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_28">                                                                         Page 29 of 61</span>
 Sharma and had access to him in the DDA. Panditji visited the DDA Office on

14th February, 2003. He informed Subhash Sharma that there was a party who

was willing to spend Rs.20 to 25 lakhs for regularizing the unauthorized

construction in Paschim Vihar. Subhash Sharma is stated to have noted the

name and mobile number of Pradeep Kapur given to him by Panditji.




34.9 On the same day, Subhash Sharma telephonically informed co-accused

Dharambir Khattar,a property dealer, about Panditji‟s visit to him as well as the

willingness of the party to pay Rs.20 to 25 lakhs for regularization of the

unauthorized construction of the lift at Paschim Vihar. He also passed on to

Khattar the name and mobile number of Pradeep Kapur. It appears that

Dharambir Khattar had provided to Subhash Sharma the mobile telephone of his

wife Smt.Nirmal Rani with the office address of Dharambir Khattar at 431,

Mathura Road.
</p>
<p id="p_85">


34.11 On 14th February, 2003 itself at about 9 pm, Khattar contacted Pradeep

Kapur and gave his address to the latter. Between 15th to 20th February, 2003,

Pradeep Kapur spoke frequently to Panditji. On 20th February, 2003, Pradeep

Kapur, Yashpal Manocha and Anil Wadhwa proceeded to DDA Office with

Panditji in Pradeep Kapur‟s vehicle. However, they were unable to meet

Subhash Sharma. Nevertheless, Panditji met Subhash Sharma at the latter‟s

office and reiterated to him that the party was willing to spend at least Rs.20 to

25 lakhs to get the unauthorized construction regularized. Subhash Sharma then

informed Panditji that the engineers involved would do the work only after

 taking some bribe money and claimed that he could not help. It is stated that on

the night of 20th February, 2003, Subhash Sharma called Dharambir Khattar

informing him of Panditji‟s visit and their conversation. Khattar was advised to

contact one Ahuja who was the concerned Executive Engineer of the area and to

offer him Rs.2 to 4 lakhs to give a favourable report. It is stated that the diary

recovered from Panditji shows an entry on 21 st February, 2003 to the effect that

"in the evening Pradeep Kapur also visits to discuss about the DDA land but

assures to do so in this way we settled account."
</p>
<p id="p_86">


34.12 On 24th February, 2003, Subhash Sharma spoke to Dharambir Khattar on

the telephone enquiring if there had been any negotiation with Pradeep Kapur.

Khattar informed Subhash Sharma that Pradeep Kapur was not interested in

negotiating.       Subhash Sharma then informed Dharambir Khattar that 27 th

February, 2003 had been fixed for demolition pursuant to the orders passed to

that effect on 6th February, 2003. On the advice of Subhash Sharma, Khattar

called up Pradeep Kapur immediately and informed him about the demolition

programme fixed for 27th February, 2003. This led to Pradeep Kapur speaking to

Panditji soon thereafter. On the night of 25th April, 2003, Subhash Sharma told

Khattar that Panditji had informed him Khattar that Pradeep Kapur was not

willing to negotiate. After collecting Panditji‟s mobile number from Subhash

Sharma, Dharambir Khattar called him up informing him of the impending

demolition fixed for 27th February, 2003. He wanted a meeting on the 26 th

February, 2003 but Panditji declined as he said he was busy for one or two days.

Panditji visited the DDA Office on 26th February, 2003 and spoke to Subhash

Sharma. During the meeting, Subhash Sharma warned Panditji that either party

 should negotiate else the structure would be demolished the next day i.e. 27 th

February, 2003. This was followed by various calls between Panditji,

Dharambir Khattar, Pradeep Kapur, Anil Wadhwa and Yashpal Manocha in

support of which the mobile telephone records are being relied upon by CBI.




34.13 On 27th February, 2003 at about 11.15 am, a demolition team of LM

Section, DDA headed by Assistant Engineer, Jiten Puri reached Police Station

Paschim Vihar. On learning this, Pradeep Kapur called up Panditji on his mobile

but learnt that the latter was out of station. Pradeep Kapur then called up the

Junior Engineer and requested for Subhash Sharma‟s telephone number.

Thereafter, Pradeep Kapur rang up Subhash Sharma at around 1.44 pm

informing him of the arrival of the demolition team. Subhash Sharma is stated

to have rebuked Pradeep Kapur stating that despite a man being sent, no interest

was shown in negotiating. When Pradeep Kapur informed Subhash Sharma that

no one had contacted him, Subhash Sharma informed Pradeep Kapur that

someone would contact him soon. Thereafter, Pradeep Kapur was asked to

hand over the phone to the in-charge of the demolition team and inform him that

the Vice Chairman was on line. Subhash Sharma then directed Jiten Puri to

return with the demolition team and therefore defer the day‟s programme. Jiten

Puri then immediately called up the DD (LM) to confirm that he had, in fact,

been called by Vice Chairman. One Israr Khan, UDC confirmed the same from

Kishore Singh, Private Secretary to the Vice Chairman. Pradeep Kapur then

called up Subhash Sharma again and informed him that the officials of the

demolition team needed the order to be confirmed from their Supervisory

Officer i.e. DD (LM). On this, Subhash Sharma asked Pradeep Kapur to request
Crl.Rev.P.Nos.340/08, 371/08, 380/08, 456/08
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_31">                                                                     Page 32 of 61</span>
 the DD (LM) to talk to him. The message was passed on DD (LM) who then

informed his Commissioner (LM) Dharmender, PW-14. In turn, DD (LM) has

ordered by his Commissioner to confirm from Subhash Sharma himself that he

had issued orders for the withdrawal of the demolition party.           On such

confirmation, DD (LM) directed Jiten Puri and the demolition team to return.

Subhash Sharma had called up the Commissioner (LM) informing him that he

had recalled the demolition team on the request from Panditji. On returning to

the headquarters, the Assistant Engineer Jiten Puri placed the above facts on file

and submitted the same to the DD (LM) and Commissioner (LM) who further

sent the file to the Vice Chairman for confirmation. The DD entries in the police

station also confirmed the Jiten Puri along with his team had gone to Police

Station Paschim Vihar on 27th February, 2003 for demolition and had returned

on that day itself without carrying out the demolition.




34.14 The call intrercept showed that after receiving the first call from Pradeep

Kapur, Subhash Sharma immediately called up Dharambir Khattar at around

1.45 pm informing him that `liftwala man‟ had called and was begging for their

lives to be saved and that he had told Pradeep Kapur that someone would speak

to Pradeep Kapur rightaway.

34.15      Pradeep Kapur realized that it was Dharambir        Khattar who was

 Khattar informed them that there were 11 or 12 officials of the DDA who had to

be paid Rs.2 lakhs each since the file had to go to two offices and that the total

deal would work out between Rs.25 to 30 lakhs. On hearing about the huge

amount, Pradeep Kapur, Anil Wadhwa and Yashpal Manocha refused to

negotiate saying that they did not have the capacity for paying such a huge

amount and that they could only pay between Rs.2 to 3 lakhs. They left soon

thereafter.      Khattar then called Subhash Sharma and apprised him of the

developments. Later, Panditji offered to go and negotiate for reduction of the

amount with the Vice Chairman and on 4th March, 2003, he met the Vice

Chairman accompanied by Anil Wadhwa. Subhash Sharma then explained that

the money had to be distributed among 11 to 12 officers and that even if each

was to be paid Rs.1 lakh, the total sum worked out between Rs.12 to 13 lakhs.

However, on persuasion of Panditji, the amount was finalized at Rs.10 lakhs.

The above information was passed on to Subhash Sharma by Khattar on the

same day.          Khattar then contacted Pradeep Kapur and asked that the

aforementioned amount was finalized with Panditji should be paid so that work

could be done to ensure the regularization of the unauthorized construction as

well as allotment of DDA land for the purposes of the said construction.

Commissioner (LM) and DD (LM) were summoned to the office of the Vice

Chairman, DDA on 6th March, 2003 and were told by Subhash Sharma that the

case of M/s APY Hoteliers and Developers recommended by Panditji and they

were asked if anything could be done with the unauthorized construction. The

DD (LM) told him that in a similar case, many people had lost their lives and

that it was unsafe. Subhash Sharma then rang up Khattar and informed him that

 Hoteliers and Developers should submit an application that the lift would be

used only for the purpose of the building and that the land adjacent to the

building should be allotted. The lift was to be built adjoining the building so

that safety could be ensured. Khattar assured Sharma that the application would

reach the DDA by 7th March, 2003. On this, Sharma gave an assurance that he

would allot space adjacent the building on receiving the application. The CBI

has collected the details of the call intercepts on 6/7 th March, 2003 of the calls

between Pradeep Kapur and Dharambir Khattar. Pradeep Kapur met Dharambir

Khattar on 8th March, 2003 to submit the application along with other papers

and also the money which had been arranged. Khattar assured him that the

application would be submitted by 10th March, 2003. A note was initiated in the

file on 11th March, 2003 by Subhash Sharma addressed to the Commissioner

(LD) enclosing the application of M/s APY Hoteliers and Developers in

connection with the allotment of land adjoining the building for the purpose of

installation of the lift. Subhash Sharma desired that the case would be examined

and sought information whether DDA could consider his request. The certificate

obtained by Pradeep Kapur from the lift maker assuring the safety of the lift was

also enclosed.

Subhash Sharma that the space could not be allotted to M/s A.P.Y.Hoteliers &amp;

He recommended immediate removal of the construction. With this note, he

apprehended that he may be posted out since the note was not favourable to M/s

found any grounds to regularize the unauthorised structure. He had to agree to

removal of the structure on 26th March, 2003.

</p><p id="p_90">35. The RC was registered by the CBI in the Lift Case on 3 rd April 2003 on the

basis of „source information.‟ The charge sheet was filed on 15th July 2004

along with the documents. A question arose whether the accused would be

entitled to be supplied the copies of the call intercepts on the hard discs of the

computers in the CBI‟s office. This issue came to be decided by a judgment

dated 11th March 2008 passed by this Court in Crl.M.C. No. 1775 of 2006

[<a href="/doc/1955364/" id="a_177">Dharambir v. Central Bureau of Investigation</a> 148 (2008) DLT 289] directing

supply of the copies of the call records and playing of the original recording

from the hard discs. A time schedule was also set down in the said judgment for

the completion of the arguments and orders on charge. The learned Special

Judge has pronounced the impugned orders on charge within the time schedule

stipulated by this Court. This Court has already held the revision petitions not to

be maintainable and is proceeding to consider the arguments on merits hereafter.




Submissions on merits on behalf of the petitioners

</p><p id="p_91">36. As regards, Dharambir Khattar, the arguments advanced by learned counsel

were as under:
</p>
<p id="p_92">Crl.Rev.P.Nos.340/08, 371/08, 380/08, 456/08
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_35">                                                                        Page 36 of 61</span>
</p><p id="p_93">        (i) The procedure outlined in CBI Manual as regards `source information‟
         has not been complied with in the present case. Accordingly, it submitted
         that the entire investigation is flawed. The registration of the FIR without
         following the prescribed procedure and the consequent filing of a charge
         sheet stands vitiated.          Reliance was placed on the decisions of the
         Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/1203995/" id="a_178">Vineet Narain v. Union of India</a> (1998) 1 SCC 226,
         <a href="/doc/166908/" id="a_179">A.Nallasivan v. State of Tamil Nadu</a> 1995 Crl LJ 2754 and <a href="/doc/1147392/" id="a_180">P.Sirajuddin
         v. State of Madras</a> AIR 1971 SC 520.
</p><p id="p_94">(ii)     The FIR was registered belatedly. If in fact the CBI knew of the
         commission of the offence from the date of interception of the first call in
         the lift case on 14th February 2003, it ought not to have waited till April,
         2003 to register the FIR. Rference was made to the decision in
         <a href="/doc/1147392/" id="a_181">P.Sirajuddin v. State of Madras</a> (1970) 1 SCC 595.
</p><p id="p_95">(iii)     The intercepted calls do not indicate any criminal conspiracy between the
         parties. The statement of the Investigating Officer Shri M.C.Kashyap
         also showed `beyond doubt‟ that the CD containing the calls "were
         doctored to the disadvantage of the petitioner". Reliance was placed on
         the judgment in <a href="/doc/279176/" id="a_182">Mahabir Prasad v. Surinder Kaur</a> AIR 1982 SC 1043
         and the judgment of the Division Bench of this Court in <a href="/doc/563839/" id="a_183">State v. Ravi @
         Munna</a> 82 (1999) DLT 730 to contend that a duplicate copy of the
         recorded conversation could not be a valid piece of evidence and ought
         not to be relied upon for framing charges against the accused. It was
         submitted that reliance placed by the learned Special Judge on the CFSL
         report also was erroneous. The judgments of this Court in <a href="/doc/1652478/" id="a_184">Rakesh Bisht
         v. Central Bureau of Investigation</a> in Crl.Rev.P.461/2006 and of the

         were referred to.
</p><p id="p_96">(iv) It was contended that offence of criminal conspiracy was not even prima
        facie made out as far as Dharambir Khattar is concerned. Calls were made
        to Khattar by Subhash Sharma and not the other way round. Therefore, the
        argument meeting of minds for the purposes of entering into a criminal
        conspiracy was absent. Reference was made to the judgments of the

</p><p id="p_98">37. The contentions on behalf of the Subhash Sharma were as under:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_33">        (1) The FIR covered incidents up to 27th February 2003 and the last
        telephonic call was dated 20th March 2003 and the FIR was registered on
        3rd April 2003. It is stated that the demolition order was passed on 26 th
        March 2003 and there were certain developments after 27th March 2003
        which were in the knowledge of the CBI but not disclosed in the FIR. It is
        pointed out that there were three more cases against Subhash Sharma,
        namely, DLF case, Shameet Mukerjee case and the Modern School case.
        The FIRs were registered at three different branches of the CBI. The
        question posed was if the branches of the CBI are a police station, then
        there is no explanation why four cases have been registered at 4 police
        stations when the offence in fact emanates under the territorial
        jurisdiction of the police station under which the DDA office falls.
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_34">        (2)    The last of the FIRs was registered on 29 th April 2003. In the
        Shameet Mukerjee case, the hard disc was required to be sealed
        immediately following the procedure outlined in the CBI Manual as the
        evidence would otherwise become suspect. Reliance is placed on the
        judgment in <a href="/doc/1243336/" id="a_189">Chandra Kant Ratilal Mehta v. State of Maharashtra</a> 1993
        CrlJ 2863 (Bom). The hard disc was sealed only on 7 th June 2003
        whereas the sample voice of the petitioner was taken in April 2003.
        Therefore, it is possible that the voice attributed to the petitioner "may
        have been planted/fed from the sample voice available." The Andhra
        Pradesh Forensic Science Laboratory (APFSL) did not give any
        certificate that the hard disc was undoctored and unedited or not
        tampered.</blockquote><p id="p_99">


</p><p id="p_100">        (3) The transcript of the alleged telephonic conversations between
        Subhash Sharma and the Dharambir Khattar indicate that there was no

         agreement to accept any bribe or cause any pecuniary advantage either to
        the Subhash Sharma or anyone else. Under <a href="/doc/1946503/" id="a_190">Section 10</a> Evidence Act
        anything said done or written by one conspirator against the other would
        become admissible only if there were reasonable grounds to believe that
        two or more persons have conspired together. The reasonable ground can
        be established or inferred from any evidence/circumstance other than the
        disputed one. Since no such evidence or circumstance exists, the
        telephonic conversation between the accused persons cannot be read
        against the petitioner and therefore the charge of criminal conspiracy
        under <a href="/doc/1897847/" id="a_191">Section 120B</a> IPC should fail. Reliance is placed upon the
        judgment in <a href="/doc/111334/" id="a_192">L.K. Advani v. CBI</a> 1997 CRLJ 2559 and <a href="/doc/194120/" id="a_193">State of Tamil
        Nadu v. Nalini</a> 1999 CRLJ 3124.
</p>
<p id="p_101">
        (4) It is further submitted that there is no physical manifestation of the
        conspiracy. Although the petitioner has been charged with having
        accepted a pecuniary advantage of Rs. 10 lakhs from APY Hoteliers,
        there is no evidence to establish the same and therefore the charge under
        <a href="/doc/88516088/" id="a_194">Section 13(2)</a> read with 13 (1)(d) <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_195">PC Act</a> is also not made out. Reliance is
        placed on the judgment in <a href="/doc/264569/" id="a_196">Alpana Dass v. CBI</a> 132 (2006) DLT 85.



</p><p id="p_102">38. On behalf of Pradeep Kapur and Anil Wadhwa, it was submitted as under:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_35">        (a) APY Hoteliers and Developers were only tenants in the property for a
        limited period of 33 months. The total cost of installation of the lift was
        for a sum of Rs. 6.70 lakhs and therefore the question of paying Rs.10
        lakhs as bribe was highly improbable.
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_36">        (b) The learned Special Judge has discharged Yashpal Manocha the co-
        accused in the case. Pradeep Kapur is in the same position as Yashpal
        Manocha.
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_37">        (c) The intercepted calls did not show the involvement of the petitioner at
        all and the particular conversations between the petitioner No.1 and other
        co-accused do not show him as being part of any criminal conspiracy.
</blockquote><p id="p_103">Crl.Rev.P.Nos.340/08, 371/08, 380/08, 456/08
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_38">                                                                        Page 39 of 61</span>
         The conversations on the other hand show that the petitioner has never
        agree to join the conspiracy and showed no keenness in contacting
        accused Nos.1 and 2, i.e., Subhash Sharma and Dharambir Khattar. On
        the other hand it was Subhash Sharma and Khattar who were pursuing the
        petitioner for a bribe and not vice-versa.
</p>
<p id="p_104">
</p><p id="p_105">        (e) There was no telephonic conversation between Subhash Sharma and
        Pradeep Kapur and also no transcript of the same. The petitioners are
        alleged to have telephoned R.S. Yadav, Junior Engineer of the DDA to
        take the telephone number of Subhash Sharma and that is on 27 th
        February 2003. This itself shows that they could not have been in
        conspiracy with Subhash Sharma. The manner of recording of the
        telephonic conversation and non-supply of the hard disc on which they
        were copied are secondary evidence and not admissible under <a href="/doc/35556724/" id="a_197">Section
        65B</a> Evidence Act. Further there were discrepancies in the duration of the
        calls shown in the transcript submitted by the telephone companies.

</p><p id="p_114">39. The contentions on behalf of Ved Prakash are as under:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_38">        (a) It is not in dispute that the Ved Prakash (Pandit ji) was himself not an

        employee of the DDA and was perhaps helping out Subhash Sharma in

        some of his private religious matters. He was in close with the Dharambir

        Khattar as well.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_39">        (b) The sanction order had been issued without any application of mind.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_40">        (c) Just like Subhash Sharma, it is argued by learned counsel for Ved

        Prakash that his voice on the tapes could have been doctored. It is

        submitted that the entire prosecution against him is mala fide object of

        which among the intercepted telephonic conversations are those between

        Subhash Sharma on the one hand and Dharambir Khattar on the other and

        then the petitioner and Khattar.

<blockquote id="blockquote_41">        (d) Reliance is placed on the judgment of Century Spinning Mills v.

<p id="p_115">40. On the call intercepts, although a separate writ petition is stated to have

been filed by Khattar and, therefore, arguments were not addressed on that

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_40">                                                                         Page 41 of 61</span>
 aspect by his counsel, the other accused did raise the grounds to that effect in

their respective memorandum of revision petition but did not urge this point

during the course of arguments. Be that as it may, this Court has in <a href="/doc/1955364/" id="a_202">Dharambir

Khattar v. CBI</a> 148 (2008) DLT 289 already dealt with the question of the

certification needed in terms of Section 65 B Evidence Act for the purposes of

</p>
<p id="p_116">


Submissions on merits by the CBI

41.1 In reply, it is submitted on behalf of the CBI that the scope of interference

by the Court with an order framing charges is limited. At the stage of charge the

Special Court was only to determine if the material brought on record made out

a case of strong suspicion against each of the accused and in the present case

there were sufficient materials on record to enable the court to come to such

conclusion. Reference is made to the judgments in <a href="/doc/813477/" id="a_204">Indu Jain v. State of

Madhya Pradesh</a> (2008) 15 SCALE 168, <a href="/doc/37843/" id="a_205">Bharat Parikh v. C.B.I</a>. (2008) 10

 41.2 As regards the question of previous sanction necessary for prosecuting the

accused, it is submitted that the absence of sanction and the effect it has on the

validity of the trial, are matters that are to be examined at the time of a trial

itself. The trial need not wait only because of want of sanction. Reliance is

placed on the judgment in <a href="/doc/1634320/" id="a_211">Prakash Singh Badal v. State of Punjab</a> (2007) 1

SCC 1 and <a href="/doc/1278061/" id="a_212">Lalu Prasad v. State of Bihar</a> (2007) 1 SCC 49. Reliance is also

placed on the judgment in <a href="/doc/1413102/" id="a_213">Paul Verghese v. State of Kerala</a> (2007) 5 SCALE

540 which holds that even if the wrong authority granted sanction that would

not call for interference unless there was a failure of justice. The expression

`failure of justice‟ as explained by the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/770735/" id="a_214">State v. T.Venkatesh

Murthy</a> (2004) 7 SCC 763 would not cover a situation comparable with that on

hand.
</p>
<p id="p_118">

41.3 On behalf of the CBI, it is pointed out that the question as to when the

prosecution should register an FIR is entirely in the discretion of the prosecution

itself. The FIR is not to be read as an encyclopedia and therefore all ingredients

of the offence need not be mentioned therein. Reference has been made to the

judgment in <a href="/doc/1038846/" id="a_215">Supdt. of Police, CBI v. Tapan Kumar Singh</a> (2003) 6 SCC 175.

As regards the delay in registering the FIR, the CBI refers to the judgment in

<a href="/doc/976160/" id="a_216">Apren Joseph v. State of Kerala</a> (1973) 3 SCC 114 wherein it has been held

that the mere delay in lodging the FIR with the police is not always fatal to the

prosecution. As to whether the delay was reasonable or not would depend on the

facts of every case.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_42">                                                                        Page 43 of 61</span>
 the voice of any of the petitioners may have been planted from the sample voice

is one of sheer desperation. At the present stage of the case when the trial is yet

to commence, this Court is only called upon to examine if there was material on

record which created a strong suspicion against the petitioner. With reference

to the roles of Khattar, Subhash Sharma, Pradeep Kapur and Ved Prakash the

call intercepts clearly indicate that they were in criminal conspiracy to commit

the offences in question. It is submitted that the conversations recorded in the

tapes constituted sufficient material. Whether in fact the tapes have been

doctored as alleged by the accused can only be demonstrated at the trial. The

reliability of the evidence need not be gone into at this stage.




41.5 It is pointed out by the learned counsel for the CBI that the submission of

the petitioners based on <a href="/doc/1946503/" id="a_217">Section 10</a> Evidence Act is erroneously premised on the

footing that there is no evidence other than the telephonic conversations to bring

home the charge. Reference is made to the notings in the file which themselves

would show that the petitioner Subhash Sharma took undue interest in the case

and interfered in the demolition action concerning the lift. The officers of the

DDA examined by the CBI have spoken of the circumstances under which the

petitioner interfered with the decision taken to demolish the lift.



41.6 As regards Pradeep Kapur and Anil Wadhwa it is submitted that these

petitioners knew very well that the licence agreement with the landlord did not

permit APY Hoteliers to erect a lift on public land and that too without prior

sanction of the DDA. It is plain that without waiting for the sanction of the

DDA to erect a lift in the commercial complex which would be undoubtedly an

 encroachment/taking over of public land, APY Hoteliers went ahead with the

construction of the lift. The petitioners therefore knowingly committed an

illegal act and therefore could not escape the consequences.



41.7 As regards Ved Prakash, it is submitted that whether in fact he was

involved in the negotiations that took place between Subhash Sharma on the one

hand and Dharambir Khattar on the other will emerge only during the trial when

evidence is led by the prosecution. As of now, the court has only to see whether

there is sufficient material to draw a strong suspicion against the petitioner for

the commission of the offence.

Scope of the petitions challenging the order on charge

42.1 The scope of the present proceedings which invoke the revisional

jurisdiction of this Court to examine the validity of an order on charge on merits

is fairly well settled. The trial court has, at the stage of the charge, to satisfy

itself whether there is sufficient ground for proceedings against the accused. The

veracity and the effect of the evidence which the prosecution proposes to

adduce, is not to be meticulously examined at this stage. In other words, the

probative value of the material on record cannot be looked into. The trial judge

should proceed on the footing that the material brought on record by the

prosecution "has to be accepted as true at that stage." [see <a href="/doc/675456/" id="a_218">Soma Chakravarty v.

State</a> (2007) 5 SCC 403 @ p.408 para 10].

         "At that stage the Court is not to see whether there is sufficient
        ground for conviction of the accused or whether the trial is sure to
        end in his conviction. Strong suspicion against the accused, if the
        matter remains in the region of suspicion, cannot take the place of
        proof of his guilt at the conclusion of the trial. But at the initial
        stage if there is a strong suspicion which leads the Court to think
        that there is ground for presuming that the accused has committed
        an offence then it is not open to the Court to say that there is no
        sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused."


42.3 The above position has been reiterated in several judgments including <a href="/doc/813477/" id="a_220">Indu

about the absence of sanction under <a href="/doc/12704/" id="a_226">Section 197</a> CrPC to prosecute them. It was

explained in para 10 (SCC @ p. 54):

<blockquote id="blockquote_44">        "10. It may be noted that <a href="/doc/12704/" id="a_237">Section 197</a> of the Code and <a href="/doc/99172794/" id="a_238">Section 19</a> of
        the Act operate in conceptually different fields. In cases covered
        under the Act, in respect of public servants the sanction is of

        considered to find out whether the alleged act has any nexus with
        the discharge of duties. Position is not so in case of <a href="/doc/99172794/" id="a_239">Section 19</a> of
        the Act."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_128">43.5 In the present case applying the tests propounded by the Supreme Court in

the aforementioned judgments, it cannot be said that the acts performed either

by Subhash Sharma or Ved Prakash had any nexus with the discharge of their

official duties. As far as Ved Prakash is concerned, he was not an employee of

the DDA but of the NDMC. The question of his discharging any official

function on behalf of the NDMC simply did not arise as far as the facts of the

present case are concerned. In the considered view of this Court, there was no

need for the prosecution to have obtained any previous sanction either under

<a href="/doc/99172794/" id="a_240">Section 19</a> PCA or <a href="/doc/12704/" id="a_241">Section 197</a> CrPC as far as Ved Prakash was concerned.



43.6 As regards Subhash Sharma, as Vice Chairman, DDA he was entrusted

with the responsibility of ensuring that the objectives of the DD Act are not

contravened. His attempt at stopping the demolition of an unauthorised lift was

contrary to the very object of the DD Act which was to prevent unplanned

development and the construction of buildings in contravention of the Master

Plan for Delhi (MPD) or the lay-out or sanctioned building plan as the case may

be. Clearly, the acts with which he is charged, were not performed in the

discharge of his official duties as Vice Chairman, DDA. This Court has perused

the sanction granted under <a href="/doc/99172794/" id="a_242">Section 19</a> PCA to prosecute Subhash Sharma. It

adverts to the materials available to the authority. It cannot be said that the said

order granting sanction is vitiated by non-application of mind.

 43.7 It was submitted on behalf of the CBI that no ground has been raised by

Subhash Sharma that since the authority not empowered to do so has granted

sanction, there has been a failure of justice. The position has been explained in

<a href="/doc/1413102/" id="a_243">Paul Varghese v. State of Kerala</a> AIR 2007 SC 2618 as under:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_45">        "8. The effect of sub-sections (3) and (4) of <a href="/doc/99172794/" id="a_244">Section 19</a> of the Act is
        of considerable significance as noted in <a href="/doc/1634320/" id="a_245">Prakash Singh Badal v.
        State of Punjab</a> (2007) 1 SCC 1. In sub-section (3) the stress is on
        "failure of justice" and that too "in the opinion of the Court". In
        sub-section (4), the stress is on raising the plea at the appropriate
        time. Significantly, the "failure of justice" is relatable to error,
        omission or irregularity in the sanction. Therefore, mere error,
        omission or irregularity in sanction is considered fatal unless it has
        resulted in failure of justice or has been occasioned thereby.
        <a href="/doc/99172794/" id="a_246">Section 19(1)</a> is a matter of procedure and does not go to root of
        jurisdiction. Sub-section (3)(c) of <a href="/doc/99172794/" id="a_247">Section 19</a> reduces the rigour of
        prohibition. In <a href="/doc/676443/" id="a_248">Section 6(2)</a> of the Prevention of Corruption Act,
        1947 (hereinafter referred to as the 'Old Act') corresponding to
        <a href="/doc/99172794/" id="a_249">Section 19(2)</a> of the Act, question relates to doubt about authority
        to grant sanction and not whether sanction is necessary."
</blockquote>



<p id="p_129">43.8 As regards the non-application of mind by the sanctioning authority, the

Supreme Court has in <a href="/doc/1769219/" id="a_250">State (NCT of Delhi) v. Navjot Sandhu</a> (2005 ) 11 SCC

43.9 There is merit in the contention of the learned counsel for the CBI that the

committed are under the PCA. It is submitted that a criminal conspiracy to

        the discharge of his official duty, if his act is such as to lie within
        the scope of his official duty. Thus a Judge neither acts nor
        purports to act as a Judge in receiving a bribe, though the judgment
        which he delivers may be such an act: nor does a Government
        medical officer act or purport to act as a public servant in picking
        the pocket of a patient whom he is examining, though the
        examination itself may be such an act. The test may well be
        whether the public servant, if challenged, can reasonably claim
        that, what he does, he does in virtue of his office. Applying such a
        test to the present case, it seems clear that Gill could not justify the
        acts in respect of which he was charged as acts done by him by
        virtue of the office that he held. Without further examination of the
        authorities their Lordships, finding themselves in general
        agreement with the opinion of the Federal Court in the case cited
        think it sufficient to say that in their opinion no sanction under

<p id="p_132">43.11 The matter can be looked at from another angle as well. The petitioners

have been charged with the offence of criminal conspiracy under <a href="/doc/1897847/" id="a_261">Section 120B</a>

to commit or attempt to commit or any abetment of the offences specified in

</p>
<p id="p_133">

43.12 Under <a href="/doc/886402/" id="a_264">Section 40</a> IPC, it has been mentioned that in Chapter VA and in

Code, or under any special or local law as hereinafter defined." Under <a href="/doc/170198/" id="a_267">Section

41</a> IPC, a special law has been defined as "a law applicable to a particular

subject." Therefore, in terms of <a href="/doc/886402/" id="a_268">Sections 40</a> and <a href="/doc/170198/" id="a_269">41</a> IPC, the PCA would be a

therefore also become punishable under the PCA which is a special enactment

for that purpose. Once the sanction under <a href="/doc/99172794/" id="a_272">Section 19</a> PCA has been obtained,

there is no need to obtain a separate sanction under <a href="/doc/12704/" id="a_273">Section 197</a> CrPC for

prosecuting the petitioners for the offence under <a href="/doc/1897847/" id="a_274">Section 120B</a> IPC.

Delay in registering the FIR

44.1 This court finds merit in the contention of the CBI that it is entirely up to

the CBI to decide when it should register FIR. After the decision in P.

Sirajuddin etc. v. State of Madras AIR 1971 SC 520, it cannot be said that the

time taken by the CBI to make some sort of a preliminary enquiry before

proceeding to register an FIR can be fatal to the prosecution itself. As regards

the allegations concerning the functioning of a public servant, it is entirely up to

the CBI to take a decision as to when it should move in to register the FIR. In

the facts of the present case, it cannot be said that the CBI acted malafide in

registering the FIR only in April 2003. It has been held in Tapan Kumar Singh

in para 20 as under (SCC @ p.183):

<blockquote id="blockquote_48">        "20. It is well settled that a First Information Report is not an

        commission of an offence though he may not know the name of the
        victim or his assailant. He may not even know how the occurrence
        took place. A first informant need not necessarily be an eye witness

         committed. What is of significance is that the information given
        must disclose the commission of a cognizable offence and the
        information so lodged must provide a basis for the police officer to
        suspect the commission of a cognizable offence. At this stage it is
        enough if the police officer on the basis of the information given
        suspects the commission of a cognizable offence, and not that he
        must be convinced or satisfied that a cognizable offence has been
        committed. If he has reasons to suspect, on the basis of information
        received, that a cognizable offence may have been committed, he is
        bound to record the information and conduct an investigation. At
        this stage it is also not necessary for him to satisfy himself about
        the truthfulness of the information. It is only after a complete
        investigation that he may be able to report on the truthfulness or
        otherwise of the information. Similarly, even if the information
        does not furnish all the details, he must find out those details in the
        course of investigation and collect all the necessary evidence. The
        information given disclosing the commission of a cognizable
        offence only sets in motion the investigative machinery, with a
        view to collect all necessary evidence, and thereafter to take action
        in accordance with law. The true test is whether the information
        furnished provides a reason to suspect the commission of an
        offence, which the police officer concerned is empowered under
        <a href="/doc/1291024/" id="a_281">Section 156</a> of the Code to investigate. If it does, he has no option
        but to record the information and proceed to investigate the case
        either himself or depute any other competent officer to conduct the
        investigation. The question as to whether the report is true, whether
        it discloses full details regarding the manner of occurrence,
        whether the accused is named, and whether there is sufficient
        evidence to support the allegations are all matters which are alien
        to the consideration of the question whether the report discloses the
        commission of a cognizable offence. Even if the information does
        not give full details regarding these matters, the investigating
        officer is not absolved of his duty to investigate the case and

<p id="p_136">44.2 Likewise in <a href="/doc/976160/" id="a_282">Apren Joseph v. State of Kerala</a>, it has been held in para 11 as

under (SCC @ p.11):
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_49">        "11. Now first information report is a report relating to the
        commission of an offence given to the police and recorded by it
        Under <a href="/doc/374796/" id="a_283">Section 154</a>, Cr. PC. As observed by the Privy Council in
        K.E. v. Khwaja AIR 1945 PC 18, the receipt and recording of
        information report by the police is not a condition precedent to the
        setting in motion of a criminal investigation. Nor does the statute
        provide that such information report can only be made by an eye
        witness. First information report Under <a href="/doc/374796/" id="a_284">Section 154</a> is not even
        considered a substantive piece of evidence. It can only be used to
        corroborate or contradict the informant's evidence in court. But this
        information when recorded is the basis of the case set up by the
        informant. It is very useful if recorded before there is time and
        opportunity to embellish or before the informant's memory fades.
        Undue or unreasonable delay in lodging the F.I.R., therefore,
        inevitably gives rise to suspicion which puts the court on guard to
        look for the possible motive and the explanation for the delay and
        consider its effect on the trustworthiness or otherwise of the
        prosecution version. In our opinion, no duration of time in the
        abstract can be fixed as reasonable for giving information of a
        crime to the police, the question of reasonable time being a matter
        for determination by the court in each case. Mere delay in lodging
        the first information report with the police is, therefore, not
        necessarily, as a matter of law, fatal to the prosecution. The effect
        of delay in doing so in the light of the plausibility of the
        explanation forthcoming for such delay accordingly must fall for
        consideration on all the facts and circumstances of a given case."
</blockquote><p id="p_137">44.3 Consequently it is held that there is no merit in the contention that the

delay in the FIR being registered renders the investigation invalid.

Crl.Rev.P.Nos.340/08, 371/08, 380/08, 456/08
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_53">                                                                         Page 54 of 61</span>
 Tapes and transcripts

45.1 This court does not find any merit in the contention that the tapes and

transcripts are unreliable and therefore should not be considered to be as

admissible piece of evidence. As already pointed out hereinbefore, at the present

stage, the Court is not required to go into the veracity of the contents of these

tapes or even the question whether the tapes have been doctored as alleged by

the accused.
</p>
<p id="p_138">

45.2 This Court has itself listened to the conversations played in the court by the

learned counsel for the CBI. It cannot be said on listening to these taped

conversations that they prima facie are either doctored or that the voice of any

of the petitioners available in the sample has been planted therein. This is really

the defence of the accused which cannot be considered at this stage. The

accused would have to lead evidence to show that the tapes or the recording of

the conversations was in fact doctored as alleged by them.



45.3 On the admissibility or the validity of the telephonic interceptions, it may

be mentioned that the orders sanctioning the interception have been passed

under <a href="/doc/1445510/" id="a_285">Section 5(2)</a> of the Telegraph Act read with Rule 419A thereof. It is

submitted that inasmuch as the present case pertains to the offence of corruption

of senior public servants and therefore jeopardizes the national interests and

public safety, the order for intercepting the telephonic conversations was

perfectly justified. In any event, the present stage is not the one where the

validity or justifications of the authorizations given for intercepting the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_54">                                                                        Page 55 of 61</span>
 telephonic calls can be examined. <a href="/doc/859989/" id="a_286">In N. Sri Rama Reddy v. V.V. Giri</a> (1970) 2

SCC 340, it was held that the tape was primary and direct evidence admissible

to show what had been said and picked up by the recorder.



Sufficient material against each of the accused

</p><p id="p_139">46. It is not possible to agree with the submissions made on behalf of Khattar

that the intercepted calls do not reflect his involvement in the criminal

conspiracy. The contention that there is no meeting of minds since all the calls

emanated from Subhash Sharma is misconceived. It is also not possible to agree

with the submissions regarding the procedure set out in the CBI manual not

having been followed. Whether in fact any provision of the manual has been

violated would again be a matter of evidence. This certainly cannot vitiate the

trial particularly when CBI has come across solid evidence which raises a strong

suspicion against each of the accused.
</p>
<p id="p_140">


</p><p id="p_141">47. It is not possible to agree that as soon as the first intercepted call occurred,

the CBI became aware of the entire criminal conspiracy and therefore should

not have waited for registering the RC. It is inconceivable that the CBI would

have known the existence of the conspiracy after the first intercepted call.

Clearly Subhash Sharma had to relent and not persist that withholding of the

demolition after the note on file by the Commissioner (LM). It was only

thereafter that the RC could be registered.
</p>
<p id="p_142">


</p><p id="p_143">48. As regards the role of Subhash Sharma, this Court has perused the notings


Crl.Rev.P.Nos.340/08, 371/08, 380/08, 456/08
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_55">                                                                         Page 56 of 61</span>
 on the file. A note was written by the Assistant Engineer stating that he needed

orders for issuing a crane for removal of the unauthorised lift. However, it was

followed by a noting on 27th February 2003 confirming that "telephonic

directions were received from the VC, DDA by me to defer today‟s programme

till further orders. Hence the programme was withdrawn in consultation with

DD (LM) W." The noting of 10th March 2003 shows that the file was placed

before the VC since "the VC desires to discuss this issue." It is plain therefore

that Subhash Sharma was taking undue interest in the case. The noting on 24th

March 2003 is very categorical when the Dy. Director (CL) noted that

permission to allow the lift to come up could be illegal and set the precedent for

future and therefore the DDA should immediately remove the unauthorised

construction. It is not surprising therefore that Subhash Sharma ultimately could

not stop the demolition of the lift in question. That in any event does not dilute

the evidence that is already on record to show that he evinced unusual interest in

preventing the unauthorised lift from being demolished.



</p><p id="p_144">49. As regards the physical manifestation of the offence of conspiracy this again

would be a matter for evidence since at this stage all that has to be seen is

whether there is sufficient material to draw a strong suspicion.



</p><p id="p_145">50. In the considered view of this Court, there is material to draw such strong

presumption against the Petitioners Pradeep Kapur and Anil Wadhwa. They

cannot claim ignorance of the MPD which did not permit the construction of the

lift on a land not belonging to them. According to the CBI Pradeep Kapur

wanted to present the DDA with a fait accompli to somehow regularize the

Crl.Rev.P.Nos.340/08, 371/08, 380/08, 456/08
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_56">                                                                       Page 57 of 61</span>
 construction of the lift. He went ahead with the construction without waiting for

any approval. These are the factors that work against Petitioners in entertaining

their plea for discharge. The petitioners‟ case cannot be compared with that of

Yashpal Manocha. These two petitioners were active in pursuing the matter of

installation of the lift and therefore do not stand on the same footing.



</p><p id="p_146">51. It was submitted that in the charge framed by the learned Special Judge

there is an obvious error inasmuch as it has been observed therein that "you

accused Pardeep Kapur looking after the affairs on behalf of your wife Kavita

Kapur       (partner of M/s APY Hoteliers &amp; Developers) during the period

February/March 2003 at Delhi obtained/accepted illegal gratification from the

firm M/s APY Hoteliers &amp; Developers as a motive for inducing Subash Sharma,

Vice Chairman, DDA, Delhi by corrupt or illegal means to show favour for

stopping demolition proceedings/regularizing unauthorized constructed lift at

Hotel M/s APY Hoteliers and Developers, Paschim Vihar Delhi and thereby

committed an offence punishable under <a href="/doc/733974/" id="a_287">Section 8</a> of the PC Act and within the

cognizance of this court."
</p>
<p id="p_147">


</p><p id="p_148">52. As far as this submission is concerned, it does appear that the wording of the

charge is erroneous and contrary to what the case of the prosecution is.

However, this defect in the framing of the charge need not vitiate the trial itself.

Under <a href="/doc/936345/" id="a_288">Section 464</a> CrPC whenever it appears to the court that the charge has

been erroneously framed that court can alter the charge to make it consistent to

what the case of the prosecution is. By this judgment the CBI is permitted to

draw the attention of the trial court to the error in the charge framed against the
Crl.Rev.P.Nos.340/08, 371/08, 380/08, 456/08
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_57">                                                                           Page 58 of 61</span>
 petitioners Pradeep Kapur and Anil Wadhwa and ask for appropriate correction.




</p><p id="p_149">53. On merits, this Court is not able to come to the conclusion that Pradeep

Kapur or Anil Wadhwa were not involved in the criminal conspiracy to stop the

demolition of the unauthorised lift. Although it may be true that the stand taken

by the APY Hoteliers initially was that the bribe amount demanded was

unreasonable. However, later on it appears that they were desperately looking to

stop the demolition of the unauthorised lift. Pradeep Kapur was certainly in

touch with Ved Prakash (Pandit ji) who in turn was in touch with the other

accused. Merely because there was no alleged conversation between Subhash

Sharma on the one hand and Pradeep Kapur on the other, that cannot lead to the

conclusion that he was not part of the criminal conspiracy.



</p><p id="p_150">54. As regards Ved Prakash, the telephonic conversations between him and

Dharambir Khattar, and his meeting with Subhash Sharma put paid to the

contention that he never was and never intended to be the part of the criminal

conspiracy. As regards the actual content of these telephone conversations and

whether they point to the role of the petitioners, this will have to be determined

at the trial. What should be the evidentiary value of these intercepted

conversations is the question that cannot be gone into at the stage of charge. For

this, the evidence will have to be led to show that the petitioner was not part of

the criminal conspiracy at all.

</p><p id="p_152"> 55. To summarise the conclusions:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_50">        (a) In the context of <a href="/doc/99172794/" id="a_289">Section 19</a> (3) (c) PCA, the words "no Court shall

        exercise the powers of revision in relation to any interlocutory order

        passed in any inquiry, trial ........." includes an interlocutory order in the

        form of an order on charge or an order framing charge. Therefore, in

        terms of <a href="/doc/99172794/" id="a_290">Section 19</a> (3) (c) PCA, no revision petition would be

        maintainable in the High Court against order on charge or an order

        framing charge passed by the Special Court.
</blockquote>


<blockquote id="blockquote_51">        (b) There is no merit in the contention that there is a defect in the orders

        granting sanction to prosecute Subash Sharma or Ved Prakash. There was

        no need for the prosecution to have obtained any previous sanction either

        under <a href="/doc/99172794/" id="a_291">Section 19</a> PCA or <a href="/doc/12704/" id="a_292">Section 197</a> CrPC as far as Ved Prakash was

        concerned. As regards Subash Sharma the acts with which he is charged,

        were not performed in the discharge of his official duties as Vice

        Chairman, DDA. The said order granting sanction to prosecute him is not

        vitiated by non-application of mind.

        trial.
