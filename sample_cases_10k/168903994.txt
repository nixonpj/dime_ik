                IN THE HIGH COURT AT CALCUTTA
                 Special Jurisdiction (Contempt)


  SUBIR KUMAR BASU
    Versus
  SUJOY KUMAR BASU &amp; ORS.


  For Petitioner: Mr.Sakhya Sen with Mr.Chanchal Kr.Dutta,
                  Mr. Soumya Dutta

  For alleged contemner no.1: Mr.Jishnu Saha with Mr.D.Ghosh
  For alleged contemner no.6: Mr.Tarun Kr. Ray with Mr.D.Nandi


  BEFORE:
  The Hon'ble JUSTICE PATHERYA
  Date : 31st March, 2010.


               The Court : Affidavits have been filed by the alleged

contemner/respondent     nos.   1   and    6    wherein      the   alleged</pre>

<p id="p_1">contemner/respondent nos.1 and 6 have sought to show cause why a Rule

should not be issued. In fact on 13th November, 2009 permission was

sought by the Rishra Municipality from the company for holding a fair

alongwith a circus at the said premises in respect of which a status quo

order has been passed. It is not known when such letter was received by

the company but a letter of the company was issued on 3rd December,

2009 whereby the company informed the concerned Municipality that an
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                      2</span>




order of status quo had been passed and so it could not allow user of the

said company land. Such letter was received on 4th December, 2009.

Inspite of receipt of such letter the fair and circus was held on the

company land. No attempt was made by the alleged contemner/respondent

no.6 to seek leave of Court or to inform non-availability of any other land

for holding the said fair or circus. Accordingly, no sufficient cause has

been shown why a Rule ought not to be issued and a Rule be issued

against the alleged contemner/respondent no.6. The alleged contemner

no.1 has alone shown cause. The alleged contemner nos.2 to 5 have not

shown cause by affidavit. Accordingly, let a Rule be issued against the

alleged contemner nos.2 to 5.
</p>
<p id="p_2">                     As regards the cause shown by the respondent no.1 it

is unknown when the letter dated 13th November, 2009 was received by the

company. It surely was received by the company or else the letter of 3rd

December,   2009    would   not   have   been   written   by   the   alleged

contemner/respondent no.1. Such letter was also belated as on 20th

November, 2009 permission was granted to hold the fair and the circus on

the land of the company and on 4th December, 2009 when the letter of 3rd

December, 2009 was received the circus had started. Therefore, there is no

explanation why intimation of the order of status quo was not given prior
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                     3</span>




to 3rd December, 2009. For the said reasons a Rule be also issued against

the alleged contemner/respondent no.1.
</p>
<p id="p_3">                Let the Rule mentioned above be made returnable six

weeks hence.
