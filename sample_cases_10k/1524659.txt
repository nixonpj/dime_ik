		The
challenge in this appeal is to the judgment and order rendered by the
Ld. Addl. Sessions Judge, Panchmahals at Godhra [for short 'the Ld.
Trial Judge'] on 13/5/2004 in Sessions Case No. 410 of 2003. The Ld.
Trial Judge convicted the appellant herein, who was original accused
in the aforesaid Sessions Case for the offences punishable under
<a href="/doc/1119707/" id="a_1">sections 395</a> and <a href="/doc/1865117/" id="a_2">397</a> of the Indian Penal Code [<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_3">IPC</a>] and the accused
was sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment [RI] for 10 years and
fine of Rs.500/-, in default to undergo simple imprisonment for one
month for the offence punishable under <a href="/doc/1119707/" id="a_4">section 395</a> of the IPC  and RI
for 7 years and fine of Rs.500/-, in default to undergo simple
imprisonment for one month for the offence punishable under <a href="/doc/1865117/" id="a_5">section
397</a> of the IPC.
</p> 

<p id="p_2">1.1.		Being
aggrieved and dissatisfied with the judgment and order delivered by
the Ld. Trial Judge recording the conviction of the accused and
awarding sentence as described aforesaid, the original accused
preferred this appeal.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_3">2.		The
facts leading to the case, in brief, are as under :-
</p> 

<p id="p_4">2.1.		On
23/9/1998 approximately at mid-night the appellant accused along with
8 to 10 persons came to the hotel situated on highway in the
outskirts of village Saliya, Taluka Devgadh Baria, District Dahod and
caused injuries to original informant Narsinhbhai  and his servants
and looted golden and silver ornaments of the first informant
Narsinhbhai and cash of Rs.500/-. In connection with this incident, 
the first informant Narsinhbhai Vanzara lodged the FIR in Devgadh
Baria Police Station which came to be registered and the
investigation was commenced. The present accused came to be arrested
on 16/9/2003. After completion of the police investigation,
charge-sheet was filed against the accused in connection with the
above offences in the Court of the Ld. Judicial Magistrate First
Class, Devgadh Baria. As the offences were exclusively triable by the
Court of Sessions, the Ld. Magistrate committed the case to the Court
of Sessions at Godhra, which came to be transferred to the Court of
the Ld. Trial Judge for trial in accordance with law.
</p> 

<p id="p_5">3.		The
Ld. Trial Judge framed charge against the accused at exh. 2. The
accused did not plead guilty and claimed to be tried. Therefore, the
prosecution adduced its oral and documentary evidence. After
completion of the evidence, the Ld. Trial Judge recorded further
statements of the accused under <a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_6">section 313</a> of the Criminal Procedure
Code wherein the accused generally denied all the allegations
levelled against him and stated that he was falsely implicated in
this case. After considering the evidence on record and after hearing
arguments advanced on behalf of both the parties, the Ld. Trial Judge
delivered the impugned judgment and he was pleased to convict the
accused for the offences punishable under <a href="/doc/1119707/" id="a_7">sections 395</a> and <a href="/doc/1865117/" id="a_8">397</a> of the
IPC  and awarded sentence as described hereinabove.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_6">4.		Learned
advocate Mr. Mehta for the appellant-accused submitted that there is
no evidence whatsoever adduced by the prosecution to connect the
accused with the crime. That admittedly in the FIR  no name of the
accused was mentioned nor any description of the accused was given.
That no test identification parade of the accused in presence of  any
witnesses was conducted. That the incident happened on 23/9/1998 and
the prosecution adduced its oral evidence by examining witnesses in
the month of February 2004 and it is the case of the prosecution that
the accused came to be identified by the witnesses for the first time
during the course of their depositions in the year 2004. That thus
after 6 years from the date of incident, for the first time the
accused came to be identified by the witnesses in the Court. That,
therefore,  the evidence regarding the identification is very shaky. 
No muddamal or any weapon came to be recovered from the accused. That
the prosecution relied upon the panchnama exh. 20 alleging that the
place of occurrence was shown by the accused. It is submitted that
the panchnama exh. 20 was drawn on 16/9/2003. However, much earlier
to said date, on 23/9/1998 the panchnama of the scene of offence was
already drawn, which is produced at exh. 18. Under such
circumstances, the 2nd panchnama exh. 20 cannot be
considered as a evidence against the accused. More or less  it is
demonstration panchnama, which can never be relied upon. Therefore,
it is submitted that the appeal be allowed and the impugned judgment
and order rendered by the Ld. Trial Judge be set aside and the
appellant accused be acquitted.
</p> 

<p id="p_7">4.1.		On
behalf of the respondent   State, Ld. APP Mr. Bhatt vehemently
opposed this appeal and submitted that the Ld. Trial Judge rightly
convicted the accused for the offences punishable under <a href="/doc/1119707/" id="a_9">sections 395</a>
and <a href="/doc/1865117/" id="a_10">397</a> of the IPC. That the first informant and the witnesses
identified the accused in open Court during the course of their
depositions. The evidence regarding identification of the accused
cannot be discarded. That the witnesses had ample opportunity to see
the face of the accused at the time of incident. That the prosecution
adduced medical evidence to show that the first informant and the
witnesses sustained injuries during the course of this incident.
Therefore, it is submitted that the appeal be dismissed.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_8">5.		The
deposition of the first informant Narsinhbhai Vanzara is recorded at
exh. 8. However, during the course of deposition, he narrated the
incident of robbery committed by 8 to 10 unknown persons in his hotel
as well as in the hotel of his brother witness Amarsinh. He stated
that he himself and his servants and his brother Amarsinh were
severely beaten by the unknown persons and the unknown persons looted
golden and silver ornaments and the cash. He stated that he lodged
FIR before police, which is at exh. 9. He identified the accused
during the course of his deposition. However, in his
cross-examination, he admitted that he was never called by police to
identify the accused in any test identification parade.  Considering
the FIR exh. 9, it clearly transpires that no names of any accused
persons including the appellant   accused are referred in the FIR.
Moreover, no description of any of the accused persons including the
appellant- accused has been mentioned in the FIR. The incident
occurred on 23/9/1998. The deposition of the first informant
Narsinhbhai came to be recorded before the trial Court on
13/2/2004.Thus, the deposition of the first informant was recorded
after about 6 years from the date of the incident. Despite this, in
his deposition dated 13/2/2004 he identified the accused. Even in his
deposition he does not narrate any description of the accused nor  he
explained as to how after about 6 years he could identify the accused
in open Court.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_9">6.		Almost
similar are the depositions of witnesses Amarsinh Vanzara exh. 11 and
Abhesinh Saburbhai exh. 12. Both these witnesses narrate the incident
of robbery in their depositions. They both admit  that they were not
called by the police to attend any test identification parade of the
accused. However, they deposed that the accused was present in the
Court and identified him in open Court. Witness Amarsinh admitted
that he had seen the accused for the first time in the open Court.
His deposition was recorded on  17/2/2004. Witness Abhesinh also
identified the accused in open Court and his deposition was also
recorded on 17/2/2004. As sated above, for the first time, they saw
the accused in open Court. In their depositions, they do not narrate
any description of the accused nor they explain as to how after the
lapse of 6 years   they could identify the accused. Considering the
deposition of witness Amarsinh exh. 11, in his cross-examination he
stated that he had attended the trial Court on previous adjournment,
but on the date of previous adjournment  his deposition was not
recorded, but at that time he had seen the accused in the Court. He
further stated that on that date even the first informant Narsinhbhai
had come and he had also seen the accused in the Court.
</p> 

<p id="p_10">6.1.		Witness
Laxmanbhai Mulabhai examined at exh. 13, turned hostile and did not
support the case of the prosecution.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_11">7.		Under
such circumstances, the depositions of 3 eye witnesses, namely first
informant Narsinhbhai, Amarsinh Vanzara and Abhesinh Saburbhai, it
becomes crystal clear that their evidence regarding the
identification of the accused is very shaky.
</p> 

<p id="p_12">7.1.		The
prosecution examined panch witnesses in connection with panchnama of
the scene of offence produced at exh. 18 and the 2nd
panchnama regarding scene of offence produced at exh. 20. The 1st
panchnama of the scene of offence exh. 18 was drawn in presence of
panchas on 23/9/1998. The 2nd panchnama of the scene of
offence in presence of the accused exh. 20 was drawn on 16/9/2003. In
both the panchnamas, the place of offence is common. Considering the
2nd panchnama exh. 20, it clearly transpires that it is in
form of demonstration panchnama and considering the provisions
contained under <a href="/doc/494844/" id="a_11">sections 25</a> and <a href="/doc/1312051/" id="a_12">27</a> of the Evidence Act, the 2nd
 panchnama exh. 20 which is a demonstration panchnama cannot be used
as an evidence against the accused.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_13">8.		The
prosecution examined Dr. Maksood at exh. 25 and produced injury
certificates of witnesses Amarsinh and Narsinhbhai at exhs. 26 and
</p><p id="p_14">27. However, there cannot be any dispute regarding the incident of
robbery having taken place and the fact that the aforesaid two
witnesses sustained bodily injuries in the incident. The important
question is about the involvement of the accused in the crime. As
stated above, no satisfactory evidence regarding identification of
the accused has been produced by the prosecution. Even the
Investigating Officer in his deposition exh. 29 admitted that after
the arrest of the accused, no test identification parade was arranged
in presence of the witnesses to identify the accused. He admitted
that no muddamal came to be seized from this accused.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_15">9.		When
such is the situation, we are of the considered opinion that the Ld.
Trial Judge erred in coming to the conclusion that the prosecution
proved its case beyond any reasonable doubt against the accused. The
Ld. Trial Judge erred in holding that the prosecution adduced cogent
and convincing evidence regarding the identification of the accused.
Under such circumstances, the impugned judgment and order rendered by
the Ld. Trial Judge recording the conviction of the appellant-accused
for the offences punishable under <a href="/doc/1119707/" id="a_13">sections 395</a> and <a href="/doc/1865117/" id="a_14">397</a> of the IPC
deserves to be set aside by allowing this appeal.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_16">10.		For
the foregoing reasons, the appeal is allowed. The impugned judgment
and order delivered by the Ld. Addl. Sessions Judge, Godhra in
Sessions Case No. 410 of 2003 recording conviction of the appellant
for the offences punishable under <a href="/doc/1119707/" id="a_15">sections 395</a> and <a href="/doc/1865117/" id="a_16">397</a> of the IPC is
hereby quashed and set aside. The appellant is ordered to be released
from jail forthwith, if he is no longer required in any other case.
Fine, if paid,  be refunded to him.
