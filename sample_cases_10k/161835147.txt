                        ORDER
</pre>

<p id="p_1">     Complainant is before this Court under <a href="/doc/974692/" id="a_2">Sections

11</a> and <a href="/doc/269047/" id="a_3">12</a> of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1961 read

with <a href="/doc/207538/" id="a_4">Article 215</a> of the Constitution of India praying to

initiate contempt proceedings against the accused as he

has disobeyed the order dated 10.09.2013, made in

C.C.C.No.3549/2013 on the file of this Court at

Annexure-B.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">     2.    Learned   counsel    for   the   complainant

submits that 08 acres 08 guntas of land of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                              :3:</span>



complainant was acquired under 4(1) notification dated

28.01.1998. In the Right of Records certain names

namely, Maruti, Bharamappa, Kallappa and Bheemappa

were found place illegally even though they were not

cultivating the land, but subsequently they filed an

application under Section 77(A) of the Karnataka Land

Reforms Act, 1961 seeking registration of occupancy

rights in their favour. The Assistant Commissioner by

order dated 02.07.2002 granted occupancy rights in

respect of 5 acres 10 guntas land in their favour

(namely      Maruti,     Bharamappa,        Kallappa       and

Bheemappa).     Feeling aggrieved by the said order, the

complainant     approached      the   Karnataka     Appellate

Tribunal in Application No.984/2002. The appeal was

admitted. Thereafter, the complainant approached the

Land Acquisition Officer and brought to the notice of the

appeal filed by him before the Karnataka Appellate

Tribunal.    He also sent letters dated 26.12.2002 and

09.01.2003    to   the   Land      Acquisition   Officer   and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                :4:</span>



requested that the compensation amount as per the

consent award should not be disbursed to anyone till

the disposal of the appeal filed by him before the

Karnataka Appellate Tribunal.        It is further contended

that the rival claimants in collusion with the Land

Acquisition Officer managed to have consent award in

their favour (namely Maruthi, Bharamappa, Kallappa

and Bheemappa). The appeal filed by the complainant

was allowed on 18.11.2004 and set aside the order of

the   Assistant    Commissioner        who     had     granted

occupancy rights in their favour as they failed to satisfy

the   essential   conditions    of   Section   77(A)   of   the

Karnataka Land Reforms Act and that the land was

vested with the Government.           It is contended that

though the complainant was a lawful owner and entitled

for payment of compensation in respect of the land

acquired, the Land Acquisition Officer disbursed the

compensation amount in favour of the rival claimants

as mentioned above during the pendency of the appeal
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                :5:</span>



before the Karnataka Appellate Tribunal. Therefore, the

complainant         approached            this       Court           in

W.P.No.5895/2006          seeking      direction    to    the     Land

Acquisition Officer, Hidkal Dam Project, Belgaum to pay

compensation for acquisition of 8.8 acres of land in

Survey No.31/1 of Gutti village in Belgaum Taluk,

Belguam.     The writ petition was disposed off by order

dated      28.02.2012      directing     the     Special        Deputy

Commissioner to hold an enquiry with regard to

disbursement of the compensation and pass appropriate

orders within six weeks from the date of receipt of copy

of the order.       Thereafter, the complainant filed a

contempt petition in C.C.C.No.3549/2013 praying to

initiate   contempt       proceedings     against        the    Special

Deputy Commissioner for disobedience of the order

dated 28.02.2012 made in W.P.No.5859/2006. In that

contempt      petition,    learned      Government             Advocate

appearing for the accused submitted that accused had

initiated proceedings against the officials and there is no
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                :6:</span>



willful    disobedience.     The     contempt     petition   was

disposed off directing the accused to take expeditious

steps to complete the enquiry and to pass orders

without further delay, but the accused failed to do so.

Therefore, the complainant is before this Court praying

for initiating contempt proceedings.


</p><p id="p_4">      3.     Sri C.S. Patil, learned Government Advocate

counsel for the accused has filed a memo stating that

the accused has passed an order dated 26.03.2014 to

recover    the   compensation        amount     from   the   rival

claimants and pay the same to the complainant within

one month.       He further submits that action has also

been initiated against the concerned.             Therefore, he

submits the contempt proceedings may be dropped.


</p><p id="p_5">      4.     Learned       counsel    for   the    complainant

submits that in spite of granting sufficient time, the

accused has not paid the compensation amount to the

complainant      and   therefore,     the   accused    may     be
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                              :7:</span>



punished   in   accordance    with   law   for   committing

disobedience of the order of the Court.


</p><p id="p_6">     5.    It is crystal clear from the circumstances of

the case that the complainant is the owner of 8 acres 8

guntas of land, which was acquired by the Government.

If the amount is wrongly paid by the Land Acquisition

Officer to the rival claimants, that would discharge the

liability of the accused. From the facts on record it is

crystal clear that the compensation payable to the

complainant is not yet paid by the Land Acquisition

Officer. Under such circumstances, the complainant is

entitled to file execution petition in pursuance of the

award made by the Land Acquisition Officer and recover

the amount, if the Land Acquisition Officer fails to pay

the same on or before 31.07.2014.
</p>
<p id="p_7">
</p><p id="p_8">     6.    In view of the above, we are of the opinion

that there is no good ground to initiate contempt

proceedings against the accused.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                               :8:</span><p id="p_9">




</p><p id="p_10">      7.   In the result, we pass the following:

</p><p id="p_11">                         ORDER

           The         accused-Special               Deputy
      Commissioner      for         Rehabilitation     and
      Reconstruction and Major Irrigation projects,
      Belgaum is directed to see that the Land
      Acquisition Officer who was respondent No.2
      in the writ petition pays the outstanding
      compensation amount to the complainant on or
      before     31.07.2014,        failing   which     the
      complainant is at liberty to file execution
      petition and recover the same in accordance
      with law. Accordingly, the contempt petition is
      disposed off.
