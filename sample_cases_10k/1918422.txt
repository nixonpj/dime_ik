HEADNOTE:



JUDGMENT:
</pre><p id="p_1">1.   This is a habeas corpus petition filed  by		Smt.
Harbans Kaur.  The petitioner prays for a direction upon the
Director  General  of  Police, State of	 Punjab,  and  other
respondents,  to produce the petitioner's sons Surinder	 Pal
Singh  and  Sarvjeet Singh.  There is also a prayer  for  an
order  directing inquiry into the cause of death  of  Gurbax
Singh.	 The  allegation  is that the Gurbax  Singh  was  in
police custody from 3rd April, 1994 till date of his death.
</p><p id="p_2">2.   It	 has been alleged in the petition that Surinder	 Pal
Singh,	Gurbax Singh, Sarvjeet Singh and Manjit	 Singh,	 the
sons  of the petitioner, were married and were	living	with
their	families  at  1619/2,  Durgapuri,  Habowal,   Kalan,
Ludhiana,  Punjab, along with their mother,  the  petitioner
herein.
</p><p id="p_3">3.   On 3.4.1994 Surinder Pal Singh was called to the Police
Post  through a Constable.  Since then his whereabouts	were
not  known and it was alleged that he was kept	in  unlawful
custody	 of  Police  and had not been  produced	 before	 any
Magistrate.   The  petitioner  made  representation  to	 the
Director  General  of  Police and  various  other  important
persons of the State, but to no avail.
</p><p id="p_4">4.   It has been alleged that on 27.4.1994one Constable came
to  the house of the petitioner and asked for Gurbax  Singh.
The Constable stated that if Gurbax Singh appeared before SI
Surjit	Chand  Sharma,	then Surinder  Pal  Singh  would  be
released from police custody.
</p><p id="p_5">5.   On 24th June, 1994, Sarvjit and Manjit  applied	 for
anticipatory bail in the Court	   of  Additional   Sessions
Judge,Ludhiana,	 and an interim order was passed.  The	case
was adjourned till 29.6.1994.
</p><p id="p_6">6.It has been further alleged that on 5.6.1994the third	 son
of the petitioner Sarvjeet Singh was picked up by SI  Surjit
Chand Sharma.  He was also not produced before the Court.
</p><p id="p_7">7.It  has also been alleged that Gurbax Singh was  taken  to
the police custody on 27.4.1994 and was mercilessly  beaten.
When his condition became very critical, the Police got	 him
admitted  in  the Hospital D.M.C., Ludhiana,  on  9th  June,
1994.  On 12th June, 1994 he was declared dead.	 It was	 the
contention of the petitioner that none of the three sons  of
the petitioner were ever produced before the Court.
</p><p id="p_8">8.In the affidavit filed on behalf of the respondent, it has
been  stated that on 4.4.1994 an F.1.R. was filed  in  which
allegations  were  made that five  persons,  namely,  Gurbax
Singh, Surinder Pal Singh, Sarvjeet Singh, Manjit Singh	 and
Puran Singh, had committed offences under the provisions  of
<a href="/doc/1436241/" id="a_1">Sections 420</a>/<a href="/doc/1131784/" id="a_2">408</a>/<a href="/doc/556166/" id="a_3">468</a>/<a href="/doc/1466184/" id="a_4">471</a>/ <a href="/doc/763672/" id="a_5">148</a> and <a href="/doc/812083/" id="a_6">411</a> of Indian Penal  Code.
The
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">242</span>
first four persons were the sons of the writ petitioner	 and
the  fifth  person was a truck	driver.	  After	 preliminary
inquiries, Surinder Pal and Sarvjeet Singh were arrested  on
23rd   June,  1994  and	 were  produced	 before	 the   local
Magistrate  on 24.6.1994. The Judicial	Magistrate  remanded
them  to judicial custody at Central Jail,  Ludhiana,  where
both  the accused are now lodged.  Puran Singh was  arrested
subsequently on 8.7.1994 from Kamal.  In his case, remand to
police custody was ordered till 13.7.1994. Manjit Singh	 was
avoiding Police and hence could not be interrogated.
</p><p id="p_9">9.There	 is a controversy about the date when  Surinder	 Pal
Singh  and  Sarvjeet Singh were taken into  police  custody.
The  writ petitioner as early as on 9.6.1994 and 13th  June,
1994  had sent telegrams and letters to various	 authorities
about the unlawful detention of her three sons, Surinder Pal
Singh,	Gurbax	Singh  and Sarvjeet Singh,  in	P.P.  Ghumar
Mandi, P.S. Division No.5, Ludhiana.
</p><p id="p_10">10.  Since  the telegrams and letters had  no  effect,	this
habeas corpus petition was filed.  Thereafter, Surinder	 Pal
and  Sarvjeet were produced before the Judicial	 Magistrate,
First  Class,  Ludhiana,  on 29.6.94 and  were	remanded  to
judicial  custody at Central Jail of  Ludhiana.	  Therefore,
the habeas corpus petition in the case of Surinder Pal Singh
and Sarvjeet Singh has now become infructuous.
</p><p id="p_11">11. The only question that remains for consideration is	 the
case of Gurbax Singh.  According to the respondents,  Gurbax
Singh  had not been arrested or interrogated or	 taken	into
police	custody in any manner at all.  Gurbax died  of	heat
stroke	in  hospital.	The  records  produced	by  Dayanand
Medical	 College  &amp; Hospital Ludhiana,	reveal	that  Gurbax
singh  was  admitted to the hospital on 10th June,  1994  at
5.40 P.M., suffering from high fever; the diagnosis was that
he was suffering from heat stroke, coma and shock.  He	died
in the hospital at 5.32 P.M. on 14th June, 1994.   According
to  the	 hospital record, the body was handed  over  to	 his
wife,  Rajinder	 Kaur.	It also appears	 from  the  hospital
record	that  at  the time of admission,  Ajay	Paul  Singh,
nephew	of Gurbax Singh, gave written consent on  behalf  of
Gurbax	Singh, to undergo the treatment in the hospital	 and
also to undergo investigations, anaesthesia or operation, as
advised by the Physician/Surgeon.
</p><p id="p_12">12.As against this, it has to be borne in mind that the writ
petitioner  had appealed to various  authorities,  including
D.G.  Police,  by telegram complaining	about  the  unlawful
detention  of her sons Surinder, Gurbax and Sarvjeet.	This
telegram  was  sent  on 9.6.94. This was followed  up  by  a
letter dated 13th June, 1994, in which it was alleged:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">	      ".......	my sons are in unlawful	 custody  of
	      the police and they are trying to show them as
	      absconders....... Gurbax Singh was  taken in a
	      general hospital by a constable and the police
	      has obtained signatures of the wife of  Gurbax
	      Singh  to	 cover their mischief and  to  prove
	      innocence.   Gurbax Singh is almost  at  death
	      bed and he may die at any moment."
</blockquote><p id="p_13">13.  This habeas corpus petition was affirmed on 16th  June,
1994.	An affidavit of urgency verified on 22nd June,	1994
was filed in this Court expressing the apprehension:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">	      "That the one son of the deponent i.e.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">	      243</span>
	      Shri  Gurubaksh Singh was murdered  in  police
	      custody  on 12.6.1994. The remaining two	sons
	      of deponent are in unlawful custody and  their
	      whereabouts  and	welfare are not	 known	till
	      date.  The deponent is under apprehension that
	      they will also be killed if the matter is	 not
	      listed immediately.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">	      4.    That  the  remaining  two  sons  of	 the
	      deponent	i.e. Surinder Pal Singh and  Sarvjit
	      Singh  were picked up by the Police on  3.4.94
	      and  5.4.94, Since then they are tortured	 and
	      harassed by the police.  "
</blockquote><p id="p_14">14.Various  allegations	 have  also been made  in  the	writ
petition  against the police officials.	 It has been  stated
that  Gurbax Singh was taken into custody on  27.4.1994,  He
was  mercilessly beaten.  He was in police custody  on	12th
June,  1994.  He was unconscious and his condition was	very
critical when he was admitted in the hospital on 10th  June,
1994.  In the F.I.R. filed on 4.4.1994 all the four sons  of
the  petitioner Gurbax Singh, Surinder Pal  Singh,  Sarvjeet
Singh  and Manjit Singh were named.  It has been  stated  by
the  respondent on Affidavit that Manjit Singh was  avoiding
the police.  No such allegation was made against the  Gurbax
Singh.	 The allegation that Gurbax Singh had been  arrested
by police has been denied.  Surinder Pal Singh and  Sarvjeet
Singh  were  produced before the Judicial  Magistrate  First
Class,	Ludhiana  on 29.6.94. This was after  the  death  of
Gurbax	Singh.	The petitioner has prayed for  inquiry	into
the  cause  of death of Gurbax Singh.  Although	 Gurbax	 was
named in the F.I.R., the respondents have not stated in	 the
affidavit  anything  about him.	 It has been  admitted	that
Surinder  Pal and Sarvjeet were arrested, Manjit  Singh	 was
avoiding police.  It is not the case of the respondents that
Gurbax was also evading arrest.
</p><p id="p_15">15.  The allegation that has been made by the petitioner  on
the  facts  that  have been brought on the  record  of	this
Court,	is  that  the  police  investigation  causes   great
concern.   The mother of Gurbax Singh had  been	 complaining
about  the  illegal detention of her three sons for  a	long
time.  She did not receive any reply to her letters from any
quarters.   It	was  only when she  filed  a  habeas  corpus
petition, Surinder Pal and Sarvjeet were produced before the
judicial  Magistrate  at Ludhiana on  29.6.1994.  There	 are
conflicting  allegations  about the cause of  the  death  of
Gurbax	Singh.	However, now that Surinder Pal and  Sarvjeet
have been produced before the Magistrate and the  Magistrate
has  remanded  them to judicial custody, no writ  of  habeas
corpus need be issued in respect of them.  So far as  Gurbax
Singh is concerned, the unfortunate fact is that he has died
in a hospital.	Therefore, no question arises for issue of a
writ of habeas corpus in his case.
</p><p id="p_16">16.There  is, however, one aspect of the case  which  causes
concern.   The writ petitioner had expressed  great  anxiety
about her sons and had sent telegrams and letters to various
authorities on 9.6.1994 and 13.6.1994.	Her  complaint	 was
that her three sons Surinder  Pal, Gurbax and  Sarvjeet	 had
been taken into police custody.	 The habeas corpus  petition
was  affirmed on 16th June, 1994.  An affidavit	 of  urgency
was  verified  on 22nd June, 1994.  It was  only  after	 the
habeas	corpus	petition  was  filed  in  this	Court,	that
Surinder  Pal  and Sarvjeet were produced before  the  local
Magistrate of Ludhiana on 24th June, 1994.  In the facts  of
this  case, it is difficult to assume that the	letters	 and
the  telegrams,	 that  were sent  by  the  petitioner,	were
without any basis.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">244</span>
<p id="p_17">Now  that Gurbax Singh has died and Surinder Pal  Singh	 and
Sarvjeet Singh have been produced before the Magistrate,  no
writ  of habeas corpus can be issued.  But, very  disturbing
facts  have  been  brought  to	the  notice  of	 the   Court
concerning  life and liberty of her sons.  On behalf of	 the
writ  petitioner,  a prayer has been made  that	 an  enquiry
should be made as to the cause of the death of Gurbax  Singh
and also whether Surinder Pal and Sarvjeet were detained  in
police	custody	 for  about a  fortnight  before  they	were
produced before a Magistrate.
</p><p id="p_18">17.  In	 the  interest	of  justice,  this  case  should  be
investigated by the Director General of Police, Punjab.	 The
Director General of Police is directed to make an enquiry as
to  exactly when Surinder Pat Singh and Sarvjeet Singh	were
taken into police custody and enquiry should also be made as
to  when,  if  at all, Gurbax Singh was	 taken	into  police
custody	 and  whether he was mercilessly  beaten  in  police
custody	 which, ultimately, led to his death.  The  Director
General of Police is directed to give a report to this Court
within a period of eight weeks from date.
</p><p id="p_19">18.  The  writ	petition, therefore, is	 adjourned  for	 ten
weeks.
