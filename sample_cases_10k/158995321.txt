    manufacturers/distillers/bottlers is confined to two conditions

    contained in the Excise Policy of one particular year, namely




    2014-15. Similarly, the challenge by the wholesalers is confined to

    only one condition contained in the Excise Policy for the year


    2014-15. However, the challenge by the retailers is to a particular

    condition contained in the Excise Policy for the four consecutive

    financial years, namely 2013-14 to 2016-17.

<p id="p_84">    8.     Condition No. 4.3 of the Excise Policy which is under




    challenge in the writ petitions filed by the retailers, had some

    variations year to year. In other words, Condition No. 4.3 in the





    Excise Policy of the year 2013-14 was worded differently from





    Condition No. 4.3 in the Excise Policy of the year 2014-15. The

    the fixation of minimum guaranteed quota and the levy of

    selling, is that the right to manufacture and sell liquor is the

    monopoly of the State, which is parted with in favour of the private

    particular level of revenue for the Government and that having

    taken a license to enjoy the privilege, any failure on the part of the

    see the grounds on which the manufacturers/ distillers /bottlers,

</p>
<p id="p_126">    Brief grounds of challenge by the 3 categories of persons

</p><p id="p_127">    18.


           The challenge to the impugned policy conditions, by the

    manufacturers, some of whom also hold subsidiary licenses to


    wholesale vend of liquor, as projected by Mr. K. D. Sood, learned

    Senior Counsel is on the following grounds:
</p>
<p id="p_128">    (i)    That the levy of additional fee, for the purpose of



    compensating the State for the loss of revenue in the form of duty




    of excise, has been repeatedly held by courts to be ultra vires and

    that therefore, there cannot be any such levy.
</p>




<p id="p_129">    (ii)   That the manufacturers as well as the wholesalers are not





    entitled as per the statutory prescriptions and the license

    conditions, to sell liquor in the open market, but they are obliged

    to sell whatever is manufactured and /or held in stock by them

    only through the retailers and that too upon the production of

    passes/permits by the retailers and hence the manufacturers and

    wholesalers cannot be penalized with the levy of additional fee

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_93">                                      46</span>

    and penalty for not achieving the target when the achievement of

    target depends upon the performance of somebody else;
</p>



<p id="p_130">                                                                .
</p><p id="p_131">    (iii)   That in any case, no penalty can be levied through the





    Excise Policy issued year after year, especially when there are





    special provisions for levy of penalty under Chapter-VI of the

    Himachal Pradesh Excise Act, 2011; and

</p><p id="p_132">    (iv)    That the levy of additional fee and penalty upon all the




    three stake holders, namely the retailers, the wholesalers and the

    manufacturers, will have in a cascading effect, leading to the


    collection of three times the revenue.
</p>
<p id="p_133">    19.     The challenge to the impugned policy conditions is made

    by the wholesalers, as projected by Mr. Sanjeev Bhushan,



    learned Senior Counsel, on the following grounds:
</p>



<p id="p_134">    (i)     That neither the Act nor the Rules contemplate any levy for

    not selling the quota allotted, except under sub-Rule (22) of Rule





    35-A of the Himachal Pradesh Liquor License Rules, 1985 and





    hence the levy of additional fee and penalty is unauthorized;
</p>
<p id="p_135">    (ii)    That insofar as the wholesalers are concerned, the levy of

    additional fee and penalty was in force only for one year, namely,

    2014-2015, but not before or after the said year, though the said

    levy continued for about four years in respect of the retailers; and

</p><p id="p_136">    (iii)   That even the wholesalers are not entitled to sell the entire

    quantity held by them in stock, in the open market and hence they




                                                                 .

    retailers to lift the guaranteed quota.
</p>




<p id="p_138">    20.     On behalf of the retailers, it was contended by Mr. Satish

    Kumar, learned counsel-
</p>
<p id="p_139">    (i) that the additional fee levied for short selling, partakes the




    character of excise duty, as it is intended to compensate the State

    for the loss of revenue in the form of excise duty and hence it is


    unauthorized by law;
</p>
<p id="p_140">    (ii)    That due to the levy of additional fee and penalty, persons

    who sell less, end up paying more and hence the policy is



    arbitrary;
</p>



<p id="p_141">    (iii)   That since the levy of additional fee is for the failure to sell

    the minimum guaranteed quota, it is also in the nature of a





    penalty for the breach of license conditions and hence the levy of





    two penalties is completely arbitrary.
</p>
<p id="p_142">    (iv)    That the levy of additional fee and penalty for short selling

    was dispensed with in the Excise Policy of the year 2018-2019;
</p>
<p id="p_143">    and

</p><p id="p_144">    (v)     That even while calculating the quantum of sales for the

    resulted in an arbitrary application of the policy, even if the policy

<p id="p_148">    (i) that the minimum guaranteed quota for the manufacturers is




    fixed every year by the State Government, after the approval of

    the Cabinet, by taking into consideration, the production/sale for


    the previous year, the optimum capacity utilization of the Unit etc.;
</p>
<p id="p_149">    (ii)    That the State is the exclusive owner of the privilege to

    trade in liquor and the citizens do not have any fundamental right



    to carry on the business to manufacture and sell liquor,




</p><p id="p_150">    (iii)   <a href="/doc/367007/" id="a_1">That the Himachal Pradesh Excise Act</a>, 2011 prohibits the

    manufacture, possession and sale of any intoxicant, except under





    the authority and subject to the terms and conditions of a license





    granted by the Financial Commissioner;

<p id="p_151">    (iv)    That <a href="/doc/948376/" id="a_2">Section 27</a> of the said Act empowers the Government

<p id="p_154">    (vi)


            That what is charged by way of additional fee and penalty

    under the impugned policy conditions are not in the nature of


    excise duty or any other tax, but only a fee for the breach of the

    conditions of license;
</p>
<p id="p_155">    (vii)   That the petitioners have not challenged the fixation of



    minimum guaranteed quota but have merely challenged the levy




    of additional fee and penalty for the failure to lift the minimum

    guaranteed quota and hence the challenge itself is invalid;
</p>




<p id="p_156">    (viii) That while duties of excise and countervailing duties of





    alcoholic liquor for human consumption, if such liquor is

    manufactured or produced in the State, is covered by Entry 51,

    the production, manufacture, possession, transport, purchase and

    sale of intoxicating liquor is covered by Entry 8 in List II of

    Schedule 7 of the Constitution.

    contemplated by the Rules, (ii) the different types of fees

    certain types of licenses which may be granted only to the holders

    of certain other types of licenses.

<p id="p_190">    36.     The Himachal Pradesh Liquor License Rules 1986 contains

    four Schedules, namely Schedules-A to D. Schedule-A lists out




    the different types of licenses indicated in Rule 27 and the rate of





    fees per annum fixed in relation thereto. Therefore, by its very

    nature, Schedule-A gets amended year after year, depending





    upon the Annual Excise Policy Announcements.

<p id="p_191">    37.     Schedule-B to the Rules prescribes the rates of assessed

    fee payable for licenses which fall under the category of assessed

    fixed fees payable for different types of licenses included in Rule

    27, are stipulated in Schedule-A in a tabular column and this




    tabular column gets amended year after year. Therefore it

    appears that the Rules are exhaustive, providing not only for (i)


    different types of licenses and (ii) different types of fees, but also

    providing for the actual amount of fees payable for that particular

    year. With this introduction, of the broad scheme of the Rules, let

    contentions of Mr. K.D. Sood, learned Senior Counsel appearing

    for the manufacturers. His first ground of attack to the impugned

    can be imposed by any by-law or rule or regulation unless the

    statute under which the subordinate legislation is made




    specifically authorizes the imposition, even if it is assumed that

    the power to tax can be delegated to the executive". It was further

    of liquor in their shops and that if they failed to take delivery of the

    prescribed minimum quantity, they will have to pay excise duty on


    the quantity of liquor that they failed to take delivery. Therefore,

    having regard to Entry 51 of List-II in the Seventh Schedule to the

    Constitution and Section 25 of the M.P. Excise Act, 1915



    authorizing the levy of excise duty, the Supreme Court came to




    the conclusion in B.C. Banerjee that no power was conferred

    upon the rule making authority to levy duty on any article which

          In fact, B.C. Banerjee was distinguished by a Bench of the

    same composition in <a href="/doc/236047/" id="a_46">Panna Lal vs. State of Rajasthan</a> (AIR


    1975 SC 2008). The question that was taken up for consideration

    in Panna Lal was as to whether the excise license granted to a

    person rendered him liable to pay a stipulated sum mentioned in



    the license or not. It was contended before the Supreme Court




    that the amount of money sought to be collected as a guaranteed

    sum, under the exclusive privilege system, partook the character





    of excise duty on the unlifted quantity of liquor. In support of the





    said contention, the decision in B.C. Banerjee was relied upon.

<p id="p_214">    But in para 33 of the report in Panna Lal, the Supreme Court

    pointed out that in the Rajasthan's case, the State Government

    same did not tantamount to the levy of excise duty. The same

    Ram Kumar</a>, cited supra. But in Ram Kumar, what was sought to




    be levied was "still head duty" on the quota allotted and a

    compensation equal to the still head duty, to the extent of





    shortfall. Thus, Ram Kumar was actually a case of levy of duty





    and hence the Court distinguished the decision in Panna Lal and

    held that the issue is settled in B.C. Banerjee. After finding on

    facts that what was levied was a duty disguised as compensation,

    the Court held in Ram Kumar that the same was impermissible in

    law as it represented in reality, a demand for excise duty on the

    unlifted quantity of liquor. In para 18 of the report, what was

    the unlifted quantity of liquor which is not authorized by the





    provisions of the Act".
</p>
<p id="p_220">    52.   Therefore, right from B.C. Banerjee, the Court was

    troubled only with the lack of authorization under the provisions of




    the Act. Hence before applying the line of decisions starting from

    B.C. Banerjee, we must see if there was authorization or not,


    under the provisions of the Act. As we have pointed out, there

    was authorization under <a href="/doc/948376/" id="a_49">Section 27(1)</a> and particularly upon the

    Financial Commissioner under <a href="/doc/1803764/" id="a_50">Section 28(1)</a>. Therefore, the line



    of decisions starting from B.C. Banerjee cannot be used by the




    petitioners as a magic wand to produce the desired result.

<p id="p_221">    53.   The second contention of Mr. K.D. Sood, learned Senior





    Counsel for the manufacturers/distillers/bottlers is that the





    manufacturers as well as wholesalers are not entitled as per the

    statutory prescriptions and the license conditions to sell liquor in

    the open market. They are supposed to sell whatever is

    manufactured or held in stock, only to the retailers and that too

    upon the production of passes/permits by the retailers. In such

    circumstances, it is his contention that the manufacturers and




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_132">                                             ::: Downloaded on - 29/09/2019 03:21:40 :::HCHP</span>

    wholesalers cannot be penalized for not selling the minimum

    guaranteed quota.
</p>



<p id="p_222">                                                               .
</p><p id="p_223">    54.   It is not in dispute on the side of the respondents that the





    manufacturers    and    wholesalers     cannot      take     the     liquor





    manufactured or held in stock by them, to the open market and

    vend the same. It is only through retailers and that too upon

    production of passes/permits that whatever is produced or held in




    stock can be sold. Therefore, the question arises is as to whether

    the manufacturers and wholesalers can be imposed with


    consequences of breach of the license conditions to manufacture

    and/or sell the minimum guaranteed quota.
</p>
<p id="p_224">    55.   We think that in this regard, the State is in a catch-22



    situation. They have to either fall or stand on the strength of their




    own plea that what is sought to be levied by way of additional fee

    and penalty is not in the nature of excise duty.
</p>




<p id="p_225">    56.   The law is well settled that if something is payable by way





    of tax or duty, the liability to pay would not depend upon the

    performance or non-performance of the assessee. But if

    something is payable only in terms of the contract, which in these

    cases have taken the shape of licenses, then the contractual

    obligation so imposed upon the assessee can certainly be tested

    on the parameters of performance, failure or breach etc.

    substance with liquor. <a href="/doc/519088/" id="a_55">Section 42</a> speaks about compensation for

    cognizance of an offence punishable under <a href="/doc/719289/" id="a_67">Section 43</a> except on

    failure to lift the minimum guaranteed quota, cannot be brought

    within the purview of <a href="/doc/719289/" id="a_68">Section 43(d)</a>. Hence, the contention that



    the penalty contemplated by the impugned policy conditions, de




    hors the provisions of the Chapter-VI of the Act, is ultra vires,

    cannot be accepted, as they operate in two different fields.

<p id="p_237">    62.   The last contention of Mr. K.D. Sood, learned Senior





    Counsel for the manufacturers is that the levy of additional fee and

    wholesalers and the manufacturers will have a cascading effect

    leading to the collection of three times the revenue and hence it is

    unreasonable and arbitrary.

    reasonable or not, can be tested.

    namely 2014-2015. But insofar as the retailers are concerned,

    they are aggrieved by a similar condition contained in condition

    No. 4.3 of the Excise Policy for four consecutive years, namely



    2013-2014 to 2016-2017. Therefore, the argument of the learned




    Senior Counsel for the manufacturers in this regard, is available

    only in respect of one year namely 2014-15 and not the other





    years.

    quantum of liquor that they failed to lift as per the minimum

    General provided to us a tabulation containing the rate of excise

    Indian Made Foreign Spirit. For the purpose of testing the




    correctness of the last contention of the manufacturers, let us take

    a highest rate of duty of excise as a bench mark. For Indian Made





    Foreign Spirit with an ED price of about Rs.5000/- per case the

    that is most advantageous to the State. If this figure of Rs.80/- per

    2014, then the amount that the State would have collected per

    proof Ltrs. would have been Rs.299/- per proof Ltrs. (Rs.219

    excise duty).

    become liable to pay an additional fee and penalty totaling to a





    grand amount of Rs.154/- per proof Ltrs.

    and penalty on this short fall in sale of 1,59,288.684 proof Ltrs.,

    @ Rs.154 per proof Ltrs. would come to               more than Rs.2.46

    crores (rupees two crores and forty six lacs).

<p id="p_287">    2015 in respect of one manufacturer. But what was sought to be





    collected by way of additional fee and penalty for compensating

    this loss of revenue, was Rs.2.46 crores. Therefore, the last

    contention of the learned Senior Counsel for the petitioners/




    manufacturers that the levy of additional fee and penalty upon all

    the three categories of persons for the very same deficit in sale


    has a cascading effect, merits acceptance.
</p>
<p id="p_288">    85.   Thus, two out of four grounds raised by the manufacturers

    may have to be upheld.
</p>


<p id="p_289">    Contentions on behalf of the wholesalers:
</p>



<p id="p_290">    86.   The first ground on which the wholesalers assail the

    impugned policy conditions is that neither the Act nor the Rules





    contemplate any levy for not selling the quota allotted, except





    sub-Rule (22) of Rule 35-A of the Rules and hence, the levy of

    additional fee and penalty is unauthorized.
</p>
<p id="p_291">    87.   But the aforesaid contention may not be wholly correct. As

    we have pointed out earlier, the Himachal Pradesh Excise Act,

    2011, contains three provisions, two in Chapter-IV and one in

    Chapter-V, which authorize the levy of (i) such sum, (ii) fees, and

    fall in Chapter-IV and the third falls in Chapter-V. The Act also




                                                              .

    and <a href="/doc/1276994/" id="a_75">38</a> of the Act have already been extracted by us in

    paragraphs 46 and 47 above. While <a href="/doc/948376/" id="a_76">Section 27</a> speaks about

    payment of "such sum" for the grant of a lease of the right of




    manufacturing or supplying by wholesale or of selling by

    wholesale or retail or of storing or of storing for manufacture or


    sale, <a href="/doc/1803764/" id="a_77">Section 28</a> speaks of payment of "fees" for the grant of

    license, permit or pass. Again <a href="/doc/1276994/" id="a_78">Section 38</a> speaks of acceptance of

    "a sum" in consideration of the lease of any right under Section

    payment of fees, there is no use contending that the levy is





    unauthorized by law.
</p>
<p id="p_296">    89.   Coming to the Rules, we have already pointed out that Rule

    26 of the H.P. Liquor License Rules, 1986 speaks of three

    different types of fees payable in respect of licenses. The rule is

    extracted in paragraph 32 above.

    is payable, the types of licenses for the grant of which a

</p><p id="p_298">    combination of fixed fee and assessed fee is payable, the types of





    licenses for the grant of which fees for allotment, renewal or





    auction is payable, are all provided in a tabular column in

    paragraph 34 above. From the table provided in paragraph 34

    above, it is clear that the wholesale vendors, who are entitled to




    the grant of L.1, L.1-A, L.1-B, L.1-BB, L.1-C and L.13 licenses,

    are liable to pay fixed fees, as per Rule 27. We do not find any


    Rule other than Rule 26, which we have extracted above, that

    categorizes the different types of fees payable by a licensee.
</p>
<p id="p_299">    According to the petitioners, there is no Rule in the entire scheme



    of H.P. Liquor License Rules, 1986, which speaks about




    additional fee. This is why it is contended by Mr. Sanjeev

    Bhushan, learned Senior Counsel for the wholesalers that a fee





    not authorized by the Rules cannot be levied.
</p>




<p id="p_300">    91.   But the above argument, appears to have arisen out of a

    confusion in the manner in which the Rules are grouped. As we

    have pointed out elsewhere, the matters relating to fixed fees are

    grouped under Part-C(i) in Rules 27 to 29. The provision relating

    to assessed fees is given in Part-C(ii), in Rule 30. But fee for

    to Part-F.
</p>



<p id="p_301">                                                                .
</p><p id="p_302">    92.   Rule 34 reserves for the Financial Commissioner, the right





    to grant all or any of the licenses indicated in Rule 1, by auction or





    by negotiation or by private contract or by any other arrangement.
</p>
<p id="p_303">    But this power is not available to the Financial Commissioner in

    so far as the licenses which can be granted on fixed fee or




    assessed fee or both. This is made clear by Rule 34 itself. Rule

    35(1) makes it clear that the licenses for certain types of retail


    vends of foreign liquor can be granted only by allotment or

    renewal on fixed fee. Therefore, it appears that what is dealt with

    by Rule 26(c) is not a third category of fee, though, such an



    impression is created.
</p>



<p id="p_304">    93.   Apart from the three categories of fees indicated in Rule 26,

    there are also other types of fees, indicated in Rule 35. Rule 35(5)





    speaks about the rates of application fee, renewal fee, basic





    license fee and the rates of license fee applicable on different

    kinds of liquor. Therefore, Schedule-C also contains rates of

    renewal fee, basic license fee and license fee. These types of

    fees are also defined in the Explanation under sub-Rule (6) of

    Rule 35.

<p id="p_305">    94.   Rule 35-A, one of the sub-Rules of which is relied upon by

    the wholesalers, deals broadly with the allotment of licenses.

    conditions stipulated therein apply only to the retailers, the





    Government has understood Rule 35 as applicable only to

    this order. Sub-Rule (22) of Rule 35-A reads as follows:

              shall still be liable to pay the license fee fixed on the basis of
              the minimum quota. In addition to the payment of license
              fee on the un-lifted Minimum Guaranteed Quota the licensee


              shall also be liable to pay additional fee at the rate of Rs.
              20/- per proof litre on the un-lifted quota, which falls short of
              80% of the Minimum Guaranteed Quota. The Asstt. Excise




              &amp; Taxation Commissioner/Excise &amp; Taxation Officer I/C of
              the district shall review the position of lifting of Minimum





              Guaranteed Quota on monthly basis. If he finds that the
              licensee has failed to lift 80% of the annual Minimum





              Guaranteed Quota by 15th of March and after hearing then
              licensee comes to the conclusion that the licensee will not be
              able to make up the deficiency by 31st March, he shall
              proceed to recover the amount of the additional fee as
              mentioned above."
</p>
<p id="p_309">    95.   Even if the aforesaid Rule 35-A is not applicable to

    wholesalers, the contention of the wholesalers that the levy of

    additional fee is unauthorized by the Act and the Rules cannot be

    sustained. This is for the reason that the Act contains provisions

    for the levy of "such sum" and "sum" as well as "fees". Each of




                                                               .
</p><p id="p_310">    these words has a different connotation. Therefore, the first





    contention that the impugned policy conditions are ultra vires the





    Statute or Rules, is unsustainable.
</p>
<p id="p_311">    96.   The second contention that in respect of manufacturers and

    wholesalers, the levy of additional fee and penalty was confined




    only to one year namely 2014-15 and that neither before nor after

    the said year, any such levy was made, does not take the


    petitioners anywhere. In a writ petition, we are only concerned

    with the question whether a levy is authorized or unauthorized.
</p>
<p id="p_312">    The fact that the respondents never imposed such a levy in the



    past, does not make it invalid. Similarly, even if the respondents




    had levied it for any number of years, the same would not

    become legal, if it is unauthorized by law. Hence, the second





    ground of attack has to fail.
</p>




<p id="p_313">    97.   The third ground of attack by the wholesalers is that they

    are not permitted by the Statute to sell the available stock in the

    open market and that they are supposed to sell the liquor only

    through the retails upon production of passes and permits and

    that therefore, they cannot be penalized for any failure on the part

    of the retailers to lift the guaranteed quota. This contention of the

    wholesalers is similar to one of the contentions of the

    manufacturers. The contention of the manufacturers has been




                                                                .
</p><p id="p_314">    upheld in this regard. Therefore, on the same logic, the third





    ground of attack made by the wholesalers has to be upheld.
</p>




<p id="p_315">    Contentions on behalf of retailers:
</p>
<p id="p_316">    98.   The first contention of the retailers is that the additional fee

    levied for short-selling, partakes the character of excise duty, as it




    is intended to compensate the State for the loss of revenue in the

    form of excise duty. But this is the very same contention that was


    raised on behalf of the manufacturers, on the basis of a long line

    of decisions starting from B.C. Banerjee. However, we have

    rejected this contention, on the basis of statutory prescriptions.
</p>


<p id="p_317">    99.   Moreover, the retailers cannot be heard to raise such a




    contention, for two reasons. As we have stated elsewhere, the

    levy of additional fee for the retailers, commenced (i) from the





    year 2009 when Rule 35-A(22) was inserted and (ii) from the year





    2013-14 when condition no. 4.3 was incorporated in Annual Policy

    Announcements which continued up to the year 2016-17. The

    retailers came up with a writ petition for the first time only in the

    year 2015, challenging not only the policy conditions imposed in

    the Excise Policy for 2013-14 but also the policy condition

    imposed in the Excise Policy for 2014-15. By the time the retailers




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_170">                                             ::: Downloaded on - 29/09/2019 03:21:41 :::HCHP</span>

    chose to challenge the condition contained in the Excise Policy

    2013-14, the next Excise Policy for 2014-15 had already come




                                                               .
</p><p id="p_318">    and the retailers, year after year, chose to apply for renewal.
</p>




<p id="p_319">    Therefore, the retailers cannot be heard to raise the above





    contention, after having repeatedly applied for renewals year after

    year dispute the existence of a rule and the continuation of such a

    policy.
</p>



<p id="p_320">    100. The question of estoppel against a Statute may not arise in

    this case, as we have already pointed out the provisions


    contained in the Statute. In addition, sub-Rule (22) of Rule 35-A,

    which we have already extracted above, provides for the levy of

    additional fee on the unlifted quota, which falls short of 80% of the



    minimum guaranteed quota. Rule 35-A in entirety including its




    sub-Rule (22) was inserted, by way of an amendment vide

    Notification No. 7-155/2008-EXN-9076-95 Dated 31.03.2009,





    published on 06.04.2009.       Therefore, the concept of levying





    additional fee for the failure to lift the minimum guaranteed quota

    had been introduced way back in 2009 and Mr. Satish Kumar,

    learned counsel appearing for the retailers, conceded that the

    attempt to challenge Rule 35-A (22) was only faint and feeble. No

    valid ground is raised in support of the challenge to the said rule.
</p>
<p id="p_321">    No argument was raised to the effect that Rule 35-A(22) is




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_172">                                            ::: Downloaded on - 29/09/2019 03:21:41 :::HCHP</span>

    ultravires the Act. In fact the argument that the levy of additional

    fee and penalty are unauthorised by law goes contrary to the




                                                                .
</p><p id="p_322">    challenge to rule 35A(22). This is why, in the course of hearing,





    the learned Counsel gave up the challenge to the rule. As against





    the rigours of the impugned policy conditions, Rule 35A(22) is

    less harsh. Therefore, the challenge to the same was given up.
</p>
<p id="p_323">    Hence the contention of the retailers that the levy is unauthorized

    by law, is unsustainable.
</p>

<p id="p_324">    101. The second contention advanced on behalf of the retailers


    is that due to the levy of additional fee and penalty, persons who

    sell less, end up paying more and hence the policy is arbitrary.
</p>
<p id="p_325">    102. But once it is admitted that the levy is both authorized by



    the Rules and by the terms and conditions of contract, the




    petitioners cannot challenge the levy on the ground that it

    imposes a burden which is onerous. Winners and losers have to





    pay different prices and they cannot weigh the efforts taken, in





    terms of the return.
</p>
<p id="p_326">    103. The third contention advanced on behalf of the retailers is

    that the levy of additional fee is in the nature of a penalty, as it is

    imposed for the breach of license conditions.           Therefore, it is

    contended that to levy an additional fee and a penalty would

    tantamount to imposition of double penalties.

<p id="p_327">    104. But we do not agree. What is contemplated by condition

    No. 4.3, in substance is as follows:
</p>



<blockquote id="blockquote_46">                                                                     .
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_47">           "(i) That insofar as country liquor is concerned, the licensee





               should pay an additional fee at the rate of ₹ 10/- per proof
               litre on the unlifted quota of country liquor which falls short





               of 100% of the minimum guaranteed quota.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_48">           (ii) That in respect of country liquor, the licensee, in addition to
               the additional fee, should also pay a penalty of ₹ 7/- per
               proof litre if the unlifted quota falls short of the benchmark





               of 80% of the minimum guaranteed quota.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_49">           (iii) That in respect of IMFS, the licensee should pay an
               additional fee at the rate of ₹ 56/- per proof litre on the

               unlifted quota of country liquor which falls short of 100% of

<blockquote id="blockquote_50">           (iv) That in respect of IMFS, the licensee, in addition to the
               additional fee, should also pay a penalty of ₹ 14/- per proof

               of the minimum guaranteed quota."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_328">    105. Therefore, the additional fee and penalty operate at two




    different levels. Therefore, there cannot be a challenge on the





    ground that the additional fee itself partakes the character of

    penalty.
</p>




<p id="p_329">    106. The next contention advanced on behalf of the retailers is

    that the levy of additional fee and penalty for short-selling, was

    dispensed with in the Excise Policy of the year 2018-19. But we

    do not know how the same would make the impugned policy

    conditions unlawful. The concession shown in subsequence years

    contention on behalf of the retailers. The second part condition

    No. 4.3 for the year 2014-15 reads as follows:

    March, insofar as the last quarter is concerned.               While the





    extracted portion of condition No. 4.3 provides for a set off, if the

    failure to lift the minimum guaranteed quota in any one or more of

    the first three quarters is compensated in the subsequent quarter,




    there is no such provision insofar as the last quarter is concerned.
</p>
<p id="p_335">    110. Therefore, the extracted portion of condition No. 4.3 suffers


    from two incongruities. They are: (i) Though the minimum

    guaranteed quota is ordained to be lifted during the period of

    twelve calendar months, the performance is assessed once in a



    quarter of three months. But so far as the last quarter is




    concerned, the above extracted portion makes it obligatory for the

    retailer to achieve the entire target by the 10th March of the year.
</p>




<p id="p_336">    In other words, though the target for lifting the minimum





    guaranteed quota can be achieved in a period of twelve calendar

    months, what is achieved in a period of eleven months and ten

    days alone is taken into account. (ii) While set off is permitted for

    the shortfall in the quota lifted during the first three quarters, if

    such shortfall is compensated before the 10 th day of March, there

    lift the minimum guaranteed quota and once the statutory Rule

    lift the minimum guaranteed quota, it is not possible for the

    respondents to impose a condition in the Excise Policy, which will

    overreach the statutory Rule. Rule 35-A (22) has not been



    repealed or amended. Therefore, we do not know how condition




    No. 4.3 can be enforced without amending Rule 35-A(22).

    conferred with a power to do a certain act under the Statute,

    subject to any Rules made thereunder, such Authority will have

    jurisdiction to exercise that power even by issuing administrative

              by the Statute.   The expression "subject to Rules" only

              exercised in accordance with these Rules. But if no Rules

    contentions of Mr. Ajay Vaidya, learned Senior Additional

    Advocate General appearing for the State.
</p>



<p id="p_351">    118. The first contention of Mr. Ajay Vaidya, learned Senior

    Additional Advocate General is that under <a href="/doc/1174818/" id="a_82">Article 298</a> of the


    Constitution, the executive power of the State shall extend to

    carrying on of any trade or business and the making of contracts

    for any purposes. Insofar as the trade of manufacture and sale of



    liquor is concerned, the State has the exclusive privilege and




    citizens do not have any fundamental right to carry on the

    business of manufacture and sale of liquor. <a href="/doc/367007/" id="a_83">The Himachal





    Pradesh Excise Act</a>, 2011 also prohibits the manufacture,





    possession and the sale of any intoxicant except under the

    authority and subject to the terms and conditions of a license

    granted by the Financial Commissioner. The licenses issued are

    in the realm of a contract and hence it is contended by                    the

    learned Senior Additional Advocate General that it was up to the

    licensees to enter into a contract or not. The licenses are

    renewed according the learned Senior Additional Advocate

    General, year after year and hence if the terms and conditions of




                                                                       .
</p><p id="p_352">    the contract are not acceptable, it was always open to the





    licensees to walk out. No one, according to the learned Senior





    Additional Advocate General, compelled the licensees to enter

    into a contract. Having entered into a contract it is not open to

    them to challenge one of the conditions of contract.
</p>



<p id="p_353">    119. In other words, the contention of the learned Senior

    Additional Advocate General is that it was up to the licensees to


    take it or leave it.
</p>
<p id="p_354">    120. But as rightly contended by Mr. K.D. Sood, learned Senior

    Counsel for the manufacturers, the argument to take it or leave it,



    advanced by the State of Kerala under the Kerala Abkari Shops




    Disposal    Rules, 2002 was rejected by the Supreme Court in

    <a href="/doc/1120277/" id="a_84">Kerala Samsthana Chethu Thozhilali Union vs. State of





    Kerala</a> [(2006) 4 SCC 327]. Paragraph 58 of the report in the





    said decision may be usefully extracted as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_54">               "58.Take it or leave it" argument advanced by Mr. Chacko is
               stated to be rejected. The State while parting with its exclusive
               privilege cannot take recourse to the said doctrine having
               regard to the equity clause enshrined under <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_85">Art. 14</a> of the
               Constitution of India. The State must in its dealings must act
               fairly and reasonably. The bargaining power of the State does
               not entitle it to impose any condition it desires."

    [(2009) 3 SCC 157], the Supreme Court followed the decision in




                                                                .

<p id="p_357">    122. The argument "take or leave it" cannot be advanced on





    behalf of the State at least insofar as the manufacturers are

    concerned. Once an industry is set up at a huge cost, providing

    for employment opportunities and the development of ancillary




    industries, to the people of the State, the survival of the industry,

    cannot be thrown at the mercy of State on the ground that the


    industry has the option either to get the license renewed or to

    shut down. In these days when the Governments of each State

    compete with one another to woo industrial houses to set up



    plants in their States, it is not open to the Government to contend




    that they have a choice to take it or leave it.
</p>
<p id="p_358">    123. While the Courts will be loathe to interfere in matters of





    contract between the State and private parties, the Courts can





    always identify statutory contracts as distinguished from non-

<p id="p_359">    statutory contracts and test the terms and conditions of the

    contract on the touch stone of statutory prescriptions. Therefore,

    the first contention of the learned Senior Additional Advocate

<p id="p_360">    124. It is true that the State is the exclusive owner of the privilege

    to trade in liquor. It is also true that there is no fundamental right

    vs. State of Madhya Pradesh</a> [(1975) 1 SCC 29], the Court





    explained that the trade in liquor has always stood on a different

    footing from other trades. It was also clarified that the State has

    the exclusive right or privilege of manufacture and sale of




    intoxicating liquor and that therefore, the consideration charged

    for the grant of such privilege, is neither a tax nor excise duty.

<p id="p_362">    125. After citing with approval, the decision in Nashirwar, a

    Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court held in <a href="/doc/1159364/" id="a_88">Har Shankar

    737] that the power of the Government to charge a price for




    parting with its rights and not the mode of fixing that price, that

    constitutes the essence of the matter. In paragraph 56 of the said





    decision, the Constitution Bench drew a distinction between a tax





    and a fee and indicated that the fixed fee charged to the vendors

    of foreign liquor need not bear any quid pro quo to the services

    rendered to the licensees. The Constitution Bench also traced the

    power of the Government to enter into contracts in this regard, to

    <a href="/doc/1174818/" id="a_89">Article 298.</a> To this extent, the learned Senior Additional Advocate

    General is right that the issue lies in the realm of contract. But

</p><p id="p_364">    126. As we have pointed out earlier the contract entered into by





    the State in the form of a license, can always be tested with





    reference to the Statute and the Rules framed there-under. None

    of the aforesaid decisions prohibit the testing of the same.
</p>
<p id="p_365">    127. Relying upon the observations of the Constitution Bench in




    paragraphs 15 and 16 of its decision, it is contended by the

    learned Senior Additional Advocate General that the petitioners


    who offered their bids in the auctions, did so with full knowledge

    of the terms and conditions attached to the auctions and hence

    they cannot be permitted to wriggle out of the contractual



    obligations. He also contended that the licensees offered their




    bids voluntarily in the auctions with full knowledge of the

    commitments which the bids involved. Therefore, he contended





    that it was not open to them to come to Court.
</p>




<p id="p_366">    128. But as we have pointed out earlier, the petitioners in these

    cases are persons who already held licensees which came up for

    renewal year after year. The terms and conditions for the renewal,

    rightly contended by the learned Senior Counsel for the

    petitioners, the applications for renewal of licenses are required to

    and the cases before the Supreme Court in Nashirwar and Har

    Shankar.
</p>
<p id="p_369">    129. Moreover, the petitioners before the Constitution Bench in




    Har Shankar were persons who committed default in payment of

    a portion of the license fee fixed in the auction. Even the annual


    license fee payable in installments, was not paid by them and

    when the arrears of license fee were sought to be recovered they

    came up with a contention that the arrears co-related to the



    unlifted quota in respect of remaining period of the lease.

    whatever is the fee fixed for the entire minimum guaranteed





    quota. What is sought to be recovered from them is the loss of





    revenue that the State allegedly suffered, in the form of duty of

    excise, due to the entire quota not being lifted. Therefore, the

    mantra of Har Shankar cannot produce the results, in these

    cases.

    <a href="/doc/1129467/" id="a_90">Rajendra Singh vs. State of Madhya Pradesh</a> [(1996) 5 SCC

    Constitution bench in <a href="/doc/39828/" id="a_91">State of Punjab vs. Devans Modern

    Breweries Ltd</a>. [(2004) 11 SCC 26], it was contended by the

    learned Senior Additional Advocate General that once it is



    accepted that what is sought to be levied is part of the privilege




    price, then the licensees had an option to opt out of the business,

    in case such levies were considered by them to be detrimental to





    their interests. Our specific attention is drawn to the last line of





    paragraph 103 of the report in the said decision. Drawing our

    attention to paragraphs 116, 119 and 121 of the report it is also

    contended by the learned Senior Additional Advocate General

    that the persons who had entered into a contractual relationship

    with the State cannot turn around and question the terms and

    conditions of the contract.

<p id="p_374">    133. But as we have pointed out earlier, the power to enter into a

    contract, which is recognized by <a href="/doc/1174818/" id="a_92">Article 298</a> of the Constitution is




                                                                .

<p id="p_376">    Therefore, the terms and conditions of the license, can always be





    tested within the four corners of the Statutory Rules for finding out

    whether they run contrary to the Rules or not.
</p>
<p id="p_377">    134. The next contention of Mr. Ajay Vaidya, learned Senior




    Additional Advocate General, is that the petitioners have not

    chosen to challenge the fixation of minimum guaranteed quota


    under the policy conditions but have merely challenged the levy of

    additional fee and penalty for the failure to lift the minimum

    guaranteed quota. Therefore, it is his contention that a person



    who does not question the imposition of an obligation cannot




    challenge the imposition of certain consequences flowing out of

    non-compliance with the obligations.
</p>




<p id="p_378">    135. The above contention is fairly justified. Persons who did not





    question the fixation of minimum guaranteed quota, cannot come

    and contend that even if they failed to fulfill their contractual

    obligations, no consequences should follow.

<p id="p_379">    136. But on the above sole ground, it is not possible for us to

    throw the writ petitions out. The reason is that the failure to fulfill

    also lead to other consequences such as the cancellation of

    minimum guaranteed quota are not challenged and so long as





    only one of the consequences of the breach of the license

    conditions is challenged, the writ petitions are maintainable, even

    without a challenge to the obligation imposed under the policy




    conditions. Therefore, this contention of the learned Senior

    Additional Advocate General has to be rejected.
</p>

<p id="p_381">    137. The next contention of the learned Senior Additional

    Advocate General revolves around Entries 8 and 51 of List-II of

    the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution. While Entry 8 relates to



    production, manufacture, possession, transport, purchase and




    sale of intoxicating liquors, Entry 51 relates to duties of excise on

    alcoholic liquors manufactured or produced in the State. This





    contention of the learned Senior Additional Advocate General is





    intended to drive home the point that the State has the exclusive

    privilege to deal in liquor.
</p>
<p id="p_382">    138. We have no quarrel with the above proposition. Right from

    Nashirwar and Har Shankar up to the latest decision in Devans,

    the Supreme Court has again and again confirmed this position.

    Additional Advocate General that condition No. 1.1 of the Policy

    licenses are granted, subject not only to the provisions contained





    in the Act and the Rules, but also subject to the licensee fulfilling

    any other obligation as imposed by the orders of the Excise and

    Taxation Commissioner. Even in the distillery licenses issued in




    Form D-2, a condition is incorporated that the licensee should

    fulfill all the directions of the Excise and Taxation Commissioner.
</p>

<p id="p_385">    Therefore, it is contended that even the terms and conditions of

    contract recognize the power of the Excise and Taxation

    Commissioner to impose certain obligations not expressly



    provided by the Act and the Rules.
</p>



<p id="p_386">    140. We have no difficulty in accepting even this contention. As

    a matter of fact, the Financial Commissioner has power by virtue





    of <a href="/doc/1803764/" id="a_93">Section 28</a> of the H.P. Excise Act, 2011 to issue directions even





    with regard to payment of fees for the grant of licenses, permits

    and passes.       Similarly, condition No. 1.1 of the Policy

    Announcements confers power upon the Excise and Taxation

    Commissioner to impose obligations that may not be traceable to

    the Act and the Rules. Thus, there are sufficient safeguards for

    imposed by the Act or the Rules. It is always permissible for us to

    test whether an additional obligation imposed by the Excise and




    Taxation Commissioner as per condition No. 1.1 of the Policy

    Announcements, runs contrary to any Rule. It is well within our


    jurisdiction to test whether the field sought to be covered by the

    Excise and Taxation Commissioner is already occupied by the

    provisions of the Act or the Rules. In the case on hand, Rule 35-

<p id="p_389">    A(22) appears to hold the field.      Therefore, we can certainly

    Advocate General that the jurisdiction of the High Court under

    <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_95">Article 226</a> is not intended to facilitate the avoidance of

<p id="p_392">    143. We do not know how the decision in Rajendra Singh can





    be pressed into service on behalf of the respondents. As in the

    case of Har Shankar, Rajendra Singh was also a case where a

    person who became the highest bidder for a certain number of




    liquor shops, failed to pay even the bid amount in monthly

    installments. When the shops were re-auctioned, they fetched a


    lesser amount giving rise to a claim for payment of the differential

    amount in terms of the contract.        When this demand was

    challenged and the matter landed up in Supreme Court, the



    Supreme Court observed that several considerations indicated in




    the decision should be kept in mind while examining complaints of

    violation of statutory Rules.

    prescribed by law, and cases where the conditions of contract are

    challenged as being violative of statutory prescription. In the case

    on hand, at least the retailers pitch their claim on the ground that

<p id="p_410">    148. Rule 35-A(22) occupies the field in respect of issues (i) and

</p><p id="p_411">    (iii). It leaves issue (ii) alone to be determined by the executive,

    year after year, depending upon the average annual consumption



    in the State, district-wise. Therefore, what is left unoccupied by




    the statutory Rules, where the executive can have a play in the

    joints, is the fixation of minimum guaranteed quota every year.

<p id="p_412">    Since the other two issues fall in the occupied field, the





    respondents cannot issue Annual Policy Announcements, without

    amending the Rules.

    as a Rule cannot override a Statute, an executive instruction

    cannot override a Rule. Fixing a rate of additional fee and a rate

    of penalty, by ignoring the rate of additional fee stipulated in Rule

    the statutory Rules. Therefore, condition No. 4.3 of the Excise




                                                                .

    2015-16 and 2016-17, is ultra vires Rule 35-A(22) and hence, all





    the writ petitions of the retailers challenging condition No. 4.3,

    deserve to be allowed. But we are obliged to point out that the

    respondents are entitled to collect the additional fee at the rate




    and in the manner prescribed in Rule 35-A(22), for all these years

    in question, including the years from which and during which, the


    Rule had been in force.

<p id="p_415">    150. Insofar    as   the   wholesalers    and     manufacturers          are

    concerned, the Rules are silent about any obligation to lift the



    minimum guaranteed quota. Therefore, it is open to the




    respondents to fill up this void, in the form of Annual Policy

    Announcements, as held by the Supreme Court in Surinder





    Singh, which was followed in Orient Paper Mills.

<p id="p_416">    151. But since what is sought to be collected by way of

    additional fee and penalty, is as per the terms of the contract, they

    can be tested in terms of the provisions of the <a href="/doc/171398/" id="a_96">Contract Act</a>. When

    so done, it is found that the wholesalers and manufacturers are

    imposed with a financial burden, not for their own failure to fulfill

    the contractual obligations, but for the failure of third parties

    position elsewhere while dealing with the second contention of

    sought to be collected from all the three categories of persons,





    exceeds the loss of revenue that the State would suffer in the

    form of excise duty. We have given detailed mathematical

    calculation with regard to the same. For one act of failure on the




    part of one of the three parties, which results in the loss of

    revenue in the form of duty of excise to the extent of a particular


    amount, it is unreasonable to impose a burden upon all the three

    categories of persons resulting in the collection of more amount

    than what was lost by way of duty of excise. Therefore, condition



    Nos. 10.28(A) (8) and 10.29 of the policy conditions for the year




    2014-15,    insofar   as   manufacturers     and      wholesalers        are

    concerned, are liable to be set aside.
