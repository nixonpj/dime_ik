<p id="p_1">Shri Sanjay Kumar Patel, learned counsel for the applicant.
Shri K.S. Patel, learned Panel Lawyer for the non-applicant/State.
Heard arguments.
</p><p id="p_2">Perused case diary and material on record.
</p><p id="p_3">This is the first bail application filed by the applicant under <a href="/doc/1783708/" id="a_1">Section 438</a> of the
 Cr.P.C. as he apprehends his arrest in Crime No.7/98 registered at Police
 Station Simariya, district Panna against him and co-accused Bhalu @
 Ramkesh for the offences punishable under <a href="/doc/203036/" id="a_2">Sections 354</a>, <a href="/doc/92983/" id="a_3">306</a>, <a href="/doc/1279834/" id="a_4">376</a> and <a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_5">34</a>
 of the I.P.C.
</p><p id="p_4">According to the prosecution, on 08.02.1998, at about 4:30 p.m. in village
 Dalpatpura, deceased Hakko Bai committed suicide in her house by hanging
 herself. Thereupon, the police registered Marg case No.1/1998. In the
 inquiry of Marg case, it was found that the applicant and the co-accused
 would eve-teased the deceased with sexual intent, as a result she
 committed suicide. Upon the outcome of the Marg case the police registered
 Crime No.7/98 and filed the charge-sheet against the co-accused under
 <a href="/doc/203036/" id="a_6">Sections 354</a>, <a href="/doc/92983/" id="a_7">306</a>, <a href="/doc/1279834/" id="a_8">376</a> and <a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_9">34</a> of the I.P.C. declaring the applicant
 absconding
Learned counsel for the applicant submits that after filing of the charge-sheet
 the case is registered as Criminal Case No.1134/98 and after committal
 proceedings the case is numbered as Sessions Trial No.62/1998. In this
 sessions case, vide order dated 13.11.1998, the co-accused was discharged
 of the charge under <a href="/doc/92983/" id="a_10">Section 306</a> of the I.P.C. and the case is transferred to
 the Court of Chief Judicial Magistrate, Panna under the provisions of <a href="/doc/495541/" id="a_11">Section
 228(1)(a)</a> of the Cr.P.C. with a direction that the co-accused be tried for the
 offence punishable under <a href="/doc/203036/" id="a_12">Section 354</a> of the I.P.C. Thereupon, the CJM held
 the trial against the co-accused in accordance with law and acquitted him of
the charge under <a href="/doc/203036/" id="a_13">Section 354</a> of the I.P.C. Vide judgment dated 22.06.2014
passed in Criminal Case No.1134/98, vide order dated 20.10.2009 passed in
Bail application No.503/99, the Sessions Judge has granted anticipatory bail
to the applicant. It is also submitted by him that in pursuance of the
aforesaid order the applicant submitted bail bonds before the arresting
police officer. Thereafter, he was never informed by the I.O. as to the date of
filing of the charge-sheet against him. He has come to know that in the
aforesaid crime number he has been declared absconding when he has
applied for issuance of the passport. In this backgrounds, learned counsel
prays for grant of anticipatory bail to the applicant.
Learned Panel Lawyer opposes the prayer.
</p><p id="p_5">On due consideration of the facts and circumstances of the case, the
submissions raised on behalf of the parties by their counsel and perusal of
the judgment dated 22.06.2004, passed by the CJM, Panna and order dated
20.10.1999, passed by the Sessions Judge, whereby the applicant is granted
anticipatory bail, but without commenting on merits of the case, I am of the
view that this is a fit case for grant of anticipatory bail to the applicant with
certain conditions. Hence, the application is allowed. The applicant is
directed to appear before the Investigating Officer of the case on or before
26.10.2015 for interrogation and submission of the documentary proofs of
his permanent address and contact numbers, if any and thereafter on every
Saturday between 8:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. to mark his presence at the
aforesaid police station till the filing of the charge-sheet against him. The
Investigating Officer is ordered that if he arrests the applicant in connection
with the aforesaid crime number and the offences, he be released on bail
immediately on his furnishing a personal bond in the sum of Rs.40,000/-
(rupees forty thousand only) with one solvent surety of the same
amount to his satisfaction. He would abide by the conditions enumerated in
 Sub-Section (2) of 438 of the <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_14">Cr.P.C</a>. and fully co-operate the I.O. in the
course of investigation. It is made clear that if the applicant does not appear
before the I.O. as stated above, this order shall stand automatically
cancelled.
</p><p id="p_6">A copy of this order be immediately sent to the S.H.O. of Police Station
Simariya for information and compliance.
</p><p id="p_7">Certified copy as per rules.
