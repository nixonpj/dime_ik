                 M.Cr.C. No. 4617/2018
Jabalpur :12/2/2018
       Shri P.Soni, learned counsel for the applicant.
       Shri Y.Dhande, learned GA for the respondent/State.</pre>
<p id="p_1">       This is the first bail application under <a href="/doc/1290514/" id="a_1">section 439</a> of Cr.P.C
for an offence under <a href="/doc/653797/" id="a_2">Section 304-B</a> of IPC in connection with
Crime No. 1045/2017 registered at Police Station Kotwali District
Tikamgarh.
</p><p id="p_2">       The applicant is a 49 years old man, who is in judicial
custody since 28-12-2017 in the aforesaid case. The allegations
against him is of having acted in a manner that has resulted in the
death of his daughter-in-law. There is a dying declaration in the
case diary which has been read out by the learned counsel for the
State in which he state that no one is responsible for the act and
that she out of anger had locked the door and poured kerosene oil
over herself and set on fire.
</p><p id="p_3">       However, learned counsel for the State has also read out
from the 161 statement of the father of the deceased, in which he
says that the applicant used to drink alcohol and trouble his
daughter and that on the date of incident, had ripped apart the door
of the house and asked the deceased to leave the house and when
he was prevented by his own son ie, the husband of the deceased,
the applicant is stated to have entered into a quarrel with him also.
</p><p id="p_4">       Be that as it may, looking at the facts and circumstances of
the case and that there is no direct allegation for any demand of
dowry and the fact that the applicant is in judicial custody since
 28-12-2017, I am inclined to allow the application and direct that
the applicant herein be enlarged on bail upon his furnishing a
personal bond in the sum of Rs. 50,000/- ( Rupees Fifty Thousand
) with a solvent surety in the like amount to the satisfaction of the
trial Court.
</p><p id="p_5">       C.C as per rules.
