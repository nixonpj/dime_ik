(BY SRI V.P. KULKARNI, ADV)

                                                 RESPONDENTS
(BY SRI H.B.NARAYANA, ADV. FOR Ri.
    SRI P.H.GOTKHINDI, HCGP FOR R2.)

      THIS PETITION IS FILED UNDER ARTICLES 226 AND 227 OF
THE CONSTITUTION      OF INDIA   PRAYING TO    QUASH THE
ENDORSEMENT ISSUED BY THE FIRST RESPONDENT DATED
30.5.2006 VIDE ANNE.D AND ETC.


    THIS PETITION COMING ON FOR PRELIMINARY HEARING IN B
GROUP, THIS DAY, THE COURT MADE THE FOLLOWING:
                               ORDER
</pre>

<p id="p_1">      In the instant writ petition, the petitioner is assailing the

correctness of the endorsement issued by the first respondent

dated 30.05.2006 vide Annexure "D" and has further sought for

a mandamus directing the first respondent to send the proposal

of the petitioner for appointment under the provisions of Rules of

Appointment on Compassionate Grounds.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">      2.    The grievance of the petitioner is that, his father was

working in City Municipality, Hospet, as a poura karmika. He

died on 27/10/1985. In view of the untimely death of the his

father, the family was put in financial difficulty. His father being

the only earning member, used to take care of the family.

Therefore, he was constrained to submit his representation

seeking appointment on compassionate ground to the first

respondent on     11/06/1999 within one year after attaining

majority.    Instead    of   considering   his   request,   the   first

respondent issued an endorsement dated 30/05/2006 intimating

the petitioner that his request has been rejected on the ground

that he has not made representation within one year from the



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                             4.</span>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                  3</span>




date of death of the employee.           Being aggrieved by the

endorsement issued by the first respondent, the petitioner has

presented this writ petition seeking appropriate relief.


</p><p id="p_4">      3.    I have perused the grounds urged in the petition and

carefully gone through the impugned endorsement issued by the

first respondent.
</p>
<p id="p_5">
</p><p id="p_6">      4.    Indeed,     the    impugned      endorsement     dated

30/05/2006 would indicate that since the petitioner did not make

a representation within one year from the date of death of his

father, his request for appointment on compassionate ground

cannot be considered. The said endorsement issued by the first

respondent vide Annexure "D" cannot be sustained and is liable

to be vitiated for the reason that the said endorsement is passed

without affording an opportunity to the petitioner and is against

the principles of natural justice. Therefore, at any stretch of

imagination, the endorsement cannot be sustained.           Without

going further into the merits or demerits of the case, it would

suffice to give appropriate direction to the respondents.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                      4</span>




</p><p id="p_7">       Accordingly, the petition is allowed in part. The impugned

endorsement dated 30/05/2006 issued by the first respondent

vide Annexure "E" and also the communication issued by the

Deputy Commissioner dated 03/11/2003 referred in reference

No.1 are hereby set aside.         The matter stands remitted to the

first respondent for reconsideration of the same afresh after

affording an opportunity of hearing the petitioner and forward

the same to the second respondent, if he is found eligible, within

a period of three months from the date of receipt of copy of the

order, if not already forwarded.            If the recommendation has

been    forwarded    to   the      second    respondent,   the   second

respondent    is   directed   to    reconsider the    same   and   pass

appropriate orders in accordance with law and disposed of the

same as expeditiously as possible within four months from the

date of recommendation to be forwarded by the first respondent.


</p><p id="p_8">       With these observations, the petition stands disposed of.
