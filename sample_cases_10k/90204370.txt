</pre>
<p id="p_1">      The learned counsel for the appellant-Revenue brings to

the notice of this Court a Circular bearing No.17 of 2019 dated

08th August, 2019 wherein the further enhancement of monetary

limit for filing of appeals by the Departments before the Income-

Tax   Appellate   Tribunals,   High   Courts   and   Special   Leave

Petitions/Appeals before the Supreme Court stands amended,

and by the said amendment the earlier monetary limit of

Rs.50,00,000/- (Rupees fifty lakh) has not been raised to

Rs.1,00,00,000/- (Rupees one crore). The earlier monetary limit

was prescribed as per Circular No.3 of 2018 dated 11th July,

2018. In the light of the same, the learned counsel submits that

the appeal is not maintainable and in view of the Circular, the

appeal may be permitted to be withdrawn. Further, the learned

counsel would also draw the attention of this Court to Clause 10
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                   3</span>


of the Circular No.3 of 2018 dated 11th July, 2018 wherein

certain exceptions are carved out. The learned counsel submits

that at the present stage it may not be possible for him to

submit whether the matter falls under any of the exceptions.

Therefore, it is prayed that liberty may be reserved to the

appellants to move this Court, if it is found that the matter falls

within the exception carved out in Clause 10 of Circular bearing

Number 3 of 2018.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">      2. On the query of the Court as to whether the Circular is

applicable to pending matters, the learned counsel draws the

attention of this Court to the communication dated 20th August,

2019 made by the Central Board of Direct Taxation to all the

Chief Commissioners of Income Tax clarifying at paragraph No.3

that the monetary limit prescribed in Circular No.17 of 2019 is

applicable to all pending Special Leave Petitions, Appeals, Cross

Objections and References.

<p id="p_4">
</p><p id="p_5">      3.   In view of the above, we permit the appellant to

withdraw the appeal for the reasons stated above.          Liberty is

also granted to the appellant to seek revival of this appeal, if it is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                4</span>


found that the matter falls within the exception carved out in
