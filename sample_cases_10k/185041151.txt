                                 ORAL ORDER</pre>
<p id="p_1">1.     Heard      learned        advocate     Mr.     Raj    Yadav       for
Nanavati Associates appearing on behalf of petitioner
and    learned         advocate    Mr.     B.B.    Malik    for   learned
advocate         Mr.     Kharadi     appearing        on     behalf       of
respondent.
</p>

<p id="p_2">2.     In the main petition, petitioner has challenged
the     order     passed     by     Labour        Court,    Junagadh      in
Reference No.79 of 1994 dated 17th September 2003,
wherein, Labour Court has granted reinstatement with
continuity of service without back wages of interim
period. Against that, Review Application No.4 of 2003
was filed by petitioner which was rejected on 5 th
April 2006. This Court has issued notice and granted
ad-interim        relief    in      terms     of    Para    12(B)      which
stayed the order of reinstatement passed by Labour
Court,      Junagadh.      The     respondent      workman    has      filed
affidavit        as     required    under     <a href="/doc/770112/" id="a_1">Section       17B</a>   of     the
Industrial Disputes Act, 1947. The copy thereof has
 SCA/24426/2006                         2/3                                ORDER



been served to petitioner on 6th August 2007. In the
affidavit,        the     specific       averments        are    made     that
respondent workman was dismissed from service on 3rd
October 1991, thereafter, he was not employed any
establishment           and     not          able    to    get     adequate
remuneration which can be terms as adequate and there
is no regular and adequate source of income, even
till     date. No counter             is filed by the petitioner
against the aforesaid affidavit.
</p>

<p id="p_3">3.     Therefore, according to my opinion, respondent
workman is entitled to full wages last drawn by him
from the date of award passed by the Labour Court.
</p>

<p id="p_4">4.     Therefore, it is directed to petitioner to pay
full     wages     last       drawn    to      respondent       workman    as
required under <a href="/doc/770112/" id="a_2">Section 17B</a> of the Industrial Disputes
Act, 1947 from dated 17th September 2003 to till 31st
August 2007 within a period of one month from the
date of receiving the copy of the said order.
</p>

<p id="p_5">5.     Accordingly,           matter         is     adjourned     to      28th
September 2007. On that day, this Court will pass
further order after verifying the fact that whether
order passed by this Court is complied by petitioner
or not.
</p>

<p id="p_6">6.     However, it is open for the petitioner that if
petitioner is having any material to satisfy this
Court      that    in     aforesaid           period,     the    respondent
workman is employed any establishment and receiving
 SCA/24426/2006                   3/3                           ORDER



adequate remuneration, then, to file necessary civil
application      before   this   Court   for    modification    of
this order.
</p>
