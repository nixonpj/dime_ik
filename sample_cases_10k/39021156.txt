</pre><p id="p_1">BRIEF STATEMENT OF REASONS FOR DECISION OF THE CASE:

</p><p id="p_2">1.         Accused Naseem has been sent up for trial on the allegations

that on 03.07.1999 at about 6.10 PM at Bus Stand, Front of Metal Forging,

within the jurisdiction of PS Maya Puri he was found in possession of one

buttondar knife having total length of 24.3 cm. and length of blade was

11 cm and length of handle was 13.0 cm. without any permit or license

and in contravention of notification issued by Delhi Administration.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                     2</span>

</p><p id="p_3">2.        Accordingly, vide order dated 17.01.2000, a charge U/S

25/54/59 <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_2">Arms Act</a> was framed against the accused to which the

accused pleaded not guilty and claimed trial.
</p>
<p id="p_4">

</p><p id="p_5">3.        In support of its case prosecution has examined 5 witnesses,

namely PW 1 is Ct. Tribhuvan who deposed that on 03.07.1999 he along

with SI Manjit Singh and Ct. Pawan Kumar were checking the vehicle at

Metal Forging, Maya Puri Road, Bus Stand and at about 6.10 PM one bus

of route no. 721 came there and when it stopped four persons got down

from the bus and they all tried to ran away. During the formal checking

one buttondar knife was recovered from the possession of accused

Naseem. All the four persons were apprehended and interrogated.

Recovered knife was sealed and seized with the seal of MT. Rukka was

prepared and got the case registered against the accused.

</p><p id="p_6">          PW 2 is complainant Ashok Kumar who deposed that on

30.07.1999 at about 5.45 PM he boarded the bus from Maya Puri chowk.

He was inside the bus at the back side and he was pushed by one person.

He further deposed that he purse was stolen by accused Naseem. He

raised alarm that the accused pick his pocket upon which two another

friends of accused person pushed him . The driver the bus stopped the bus

at Metal Forging Bus Stand. Some police officials were already present on

the bus stand and they apprehended all the four accused persons who

were trying to get down from the back door of the bus. Formal search of

accused Naseem was conducted and during the search one buttondar

knife was recovered from his pent. He made his statement as Ex. PW 2/A.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                        3</span>

The knife was seized vide memo Ex. PW 2/B and sketch of knife is Ex. PW

2/C. Accused was arrested vide memo Ex. PW           2/D and his personal

search was conducted vide memo Ex. PW 2/E.
</p>
<p id="p_7">            PW 3 Ct. Pawan and PW 4 Ct. Paramvir also deposed on the

similar lines of PW 1.
</p>
<p id="p_8">            PW 5 is HC Roshan Lal who also deposed on the similar lines of

PW 3 and 4. He further deposed that he recorded the statement of

complainant Ashok Kumar and made his endorsement on the same as Ex.

PW 5/A. He also prepared the site plan as Ex. PW 5/B. He recorded the

statement of witnesses and obtained the copy of notification and filed

the charge sheet in the court.
</p>
<p id="p_9">

</p><p id="p_10">4.          Thereafter, prosecution evidence was closed and statement of

accused u/s 313 r/w Sec. 281 Cr. P.C. was recorded wherein all the

incriminating evidence existing on record including exhibited documents

were put to the accused to which stand of the accused was of general

denial and stated he has been falsely implicated in this case         and

accused has chosen to lead evidence in his defence. However accused

could not produce any DE despite opportunities.
</p>
<p id="p_11">

</p><p id="p_12">5.          I have heard Ld. APP for the State and Ld. Counsel for the

accused and perused the record carefully.
</p>
<p id="p_13">

</p><p id="p_14">6.          Admittedly, in the present case no public witness has been

joined despite availability.     Admittedly, several public witnesses were
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                         4</span>

available at the time when the accused was arrested and when the

alleged recovery was affected from the accused and other formalities

were completed.          Even the name or addresses of the persons who were

requested    to   join    the   investigation, have   not   been    mentioned.

Admittedly, no notice was served by the IO upon the public persons on

their refusal to join the investigation. Thus, it appears that sincere efforts

were not made by the IO to join independent witnesses and hence the

benefit of doubt must be given to the accused. I am fortified on this point

by the judgments in the case of Prem Singh Vs State, 1996, CRL. L.J. 3604

(Delhi), Pawan Kumar Vs           Delhi Administration, 1989 Crl. L.J. 127, Jeet

Singh   Vs State of Punjab, 1999 (1) C.C. Cases HC 403, Roop Chand vs

State of Haryana 1990 (1) C.L.R. 69, Jit Singh Vs       State of punjab, R.C.C.

1987 (1) 286, Sadhu Singh       Vs   State of Haryana 2000(2) C.C. Cases HC

</p><p id="p_15">73.




</p><p id="p_16">7.          From the testimony of PWs it is clear that no efforts were made

to hand over the seal after use to independent public person and hence

benefit of doubt is to be given to the accused. I am supported on this

point by the judgment in the case of Saifullah        Vs    State 1998 (1) C.C.

Cases 497 (Delhi) and Abdul Gaffar Vs State 1996 JCC 497 (Delhi).

</p><p id="p_17">            Moreover, the departure or arrival of the police officials to the

police station have not been proved by the prosecution to lend

credence to the version of the prosecution.
</p>
<p id="p_18">

</p><p id="p_19">8.           No public witness has been joined in at the time of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                      5</span>

apprehension of the accused or at the time of carrying out other

formalities like arrest of accused, preparation of seizure memo, site plan

and personal search of the accused etc.



</p><p id="p_20">9.        In view of above said discussions, I am of the considered

opinion that the prosecution has not been able to prove its case against

the accused beyond reasonable doubt.          Accused is given benefit of

doubt and he is accordingly acquitted of the charge punishable U/S

25/54/59 <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_3">Arms Act</a>.     Case property be disposed of as per law after expiry

of period of appeal.</p><pre id="pre_3">
