</pre><p id="p_1">JUDGMENT

1994 SUPPL. (2) SCR 808

The Judgment of the Court was delivered by

R.M. SAHAI, J. The question of law that arises for consideration in. this
appeal directed against order of Maharashtra Administrative Tribunal,
Bombay Bench, is whether the appellant who was appointed temporally against
a permanent post was entitled to be regularised under Temporary Government
Servants Extension of Permanency Resolution issued by the State Government
is 1975 or under any other equitable principle as she had been working
continuously since then and had worked for nine years, without break on the
date the government advertised the post to be filled through Public Service
Commission.
</p>
<p id="p_2">Few dates and facts which are more or less undisputed may be narrated in
brief. The appellant, a Bachelor in Dental Surgery (B.D.S.) was selected by
the Division Selection Board and was appointed as Lecturer in Dentistry in
Government B J. Medical College, Pune on 16th September 1978. In the
appointment letter it was mentioned that the appellant was appointed, 'on a
purely temporary basis pending further orders as Lecturer in Dentistry at
the BJ. Medical College, Pune from date of taking over charge .......', The
letter further mentioned that the appointment of the appellant was subject
to her being found physically fit for government service by the Medical
Board and satisfactory report regarding antecedents and character. The
appellant was prohibited from doing any private practice and it was stated
that her appointment was, 'purely on a temporary basis subject to
termination without notice and without any reasons being assigned. It was
provided that she, 'shall not quit service without giving one month's
notice in advance to the Government or to the appropriate authority. In the
case of any default in giving proper notice as stated above', she, 'shall
pay to Government one month's pay in lieu thereof. And her resignation was
no to be accepted in the middle of the academic session. IN 1980 and 1985
the appellant was selected by the Public Service Com-mission for the post
of Lecturer of Dental Mechanics and Period britia respectively. But
admittedly she did not join. In August 1987 the Dean of the Medical College
appears to have written some letter to the Government for placing the
appellant on deputation for post graduation. The Govern-ment did not agree
to it, presumably, because the qualification for a lecturer in dentistry
had been changed in the meantime in 1986. In March 1988 the post which was
held by the appellant was advertisement through Public Service Commission.
The appellant filed a writ petition claiming that there was no vacancy as
she having rendered nine years of Service without break as a lecturer she
stood regularised as per the Government Resolution dated 19.9,1975. Her
claim was contested by the State of various grounds including that the
petition was pre-mature. The petition was transferred in 1991 to the
Tribunal. It appears that even though there was an interim order in favour
of appellant but the selection was not stayed. Therefore, Dr. Satish B.
Barale, respondent no. 3 was selected by the Public Service Commission but
he could not join due to the interim order in favour of the appellant. He,
too, therefore, filed petition before the Tribunal for a direction to the
Medical College, Pune, to appoint him to the post for which he was
selected.
</p>
<p id="p_3">Both these petitions have been decided by the Tribunal and the Claim of the
appellant has been rejected as the benefit of resolution dated 19.9.1975
could not be extended to her. It was held that this resolution required a
temporary Government servant to satisfy three conditions before his
services could be regularised. One, that the original appointment of the
Government servant must have been made in conformity with the relevant
recruitment rules and the prescribed method of recruitment. The other two
conditions that the Government servant should have produced the requisite
physical fitness certificate and that he must have possessed a good record
of service are not necessary to be discussed as it was not disputed by the
Tribunal that these two conditions were satisfied. But according to
Tribunal the appointment of appellant was not in accordance with
recruitment rules even though it found that the appellant was duly
qualified and was eligible to be appointed on the post of Lecturer. What
led the Tribunal to reject the claim of the appellant was that since this
was a class-II post it had to be filled in through Maharashtra Public
Service Commission. The Tribunal did not find any merit in the claim of
appellant that there was no specific denial by the respondent that the post
was not in the purview of the Commission at the relevant time. The Tribunal
held that on 8th October 1965 a notification was issued by the Government
specifying therein the posts which were excluded from the purview of the
Public Service Commission. But since the post of lecturer in Government
Medical College Class-II was not mentioned in it, it could not be claimed
by the appellant that her appointment stood regularised and the first
condition of the 1,975 Resolution was satisfied.
</p>
<p id="p_4">The terms of appointment letter had been extracted earlier. It is not
disputed that the post on which the appellant was appointed was a per-
manent post. A person appointed temporarily to a permanent post cannot be
equated with a person appointed ad-hoc. A temporary appointee to a
permanent post has all the privileges of a regular employee except that the
appointment becomes permanent only in the manner provided in the rules.
Even the tenor of the appointment letter indicates that the appellant was
not to be treated a temporary employee in the sense in which it is,
normally understood. It was not a tenurial appointment or an appointment
till further orders. Even this was not said that the appellant was being
ap-pointed till the regular candidate was selected. However, chat by itself
could not confer any permanent status on the appellant nor she could claim
regularisation unless it is established that she became permanent under
some rule or order or 1975 Resolution by satisfying the conditions men-
tioned therein.
</p>
<p id="p_5">The rules for appointment to the post of a lecturer in Dentistry were
framed by the Governor in 1977 in exercise of the power under <a href="/doc/1123043/" id="a_1">Article 309</a>
of the Constitution. They were in supersession of all existing rules and
orders issued in this behalf. The method of appointment of a lecturer in
Dentistry in the Medical College was to be governed by this rule. The two
methods provided in the order were by transfer and by nomination. A person
appointed by nomination was to be placed on probation for two years. The
rules do not throw any light on the procedure of nomination. But that does
not help the appellant as she was not placed on probation.
</p>
<p id="p_6">Nor it is claimed by her that she was appointed by nomination. Further it
appears from various advertisements issued by the Government from time to
time that the appointments for permanent selection were made through Public
Service Commission. It is true as is clear from the counter- affidavit
filed by the Under Secretary in the Education Department that the tem-
porary appointments for lecturers were made by the selection Board. That
procedure Is still resorted to as appears from the recent advertisement
stated to have been issued by the University. But even such appointments
were not regularised ipso facto by the Government Resolution of 1975 as in
1983 when the Government was faced with similar problem of large number of
medical officers in Class-II it sent a proposal to the commission to hold a
special test which was agreed to as is clear from the Resolution dated 3rd
February 1984 to the following effect:
</p>
<p id="p_7">"On the proposal made by Government for regularisation of appointments of
Medical Officers mentioned in para I, the Maharashtra public Service
Commission agreed as a very special case, to absorb such Medical Officers
who had put in 3 or more years of service as on 28th February 1983 and were
successful in the special test conducted by the Commission for the purpose
of their absorption."
</p>
<p id="p_8">Since the Government has been treating the class-II post in purview of
Public Service Commission and these posts Were not included in the
notification issued on 8th October 1965 by the State Government the
Tribunal did not commit any error in recording the finding that the post of
Lecturer in Dentistry in the State of Maharashtra even in 1978 was within
purview of the Public Service Commission. Even otherwise the Temporary
Government Services Regularisation Rules issued by the Government in 1975
should not be held, in the larger interest, to be applicable to those cases
where the post specially dass-II service is in purview of the public
Service Commission, ln. <a href="/doc/786046/" id="a_2">Dr. MA, Hague v. Union of India</a>, [1993] 2 SCC 20
(219) it was observed by this Court :
</p>
<p id="p_9">".....,.,.... we cannot lose sight of the fact that the recruitment rules
made under <a href="/doc/1123043/" id="a_3">Article 309</a> of the Constitution have to be followed strictly and
not in breach. If a disregard of the rules and the by passing of the Public
Service Commissions are permitted, it will open a back-door for illegal
recruitment without limit. In fact this Court has, of late, been witnessing
a constant violation of the recruitment rules and a scant respect for the
Constitutional provisions requiring recruitment to the services through the
Public service commission, ft appears that since this Court has in some
cases permitted regularisation of the irregularly recruited employee, some
Governments and authorities have been increasingly resort-ing to irregular
recruitments. The result has been that the recruit-ment rules and the
Public Service Commissions. have been kept in cold storage and candidate
dictated by various considerations are being recruited as a matter of
course."
</p>
<p id="p_10">The claim of the appellant therefore, that she stood regularised under 1975
Resolution cannot be accepted.
</p>
<p id="p_11">Nor the claim or the appellant, that she having worked as Lecturer without
break for nine years on the date the advertisement was issued she should be
deemed to have been regularised appears to be well founded. Eligibility and
continuous working for however long period should not be permitted to over-
reach the law. Requirement of rules of section through Commission cannot be
substituted by humane considerations. Law must take its course.
Consequently the appellant was not entitled to claim that she should have
been deemed to have been regularised as she had been working without break
for nine years.
</p>
<p id="p_12">Even then, at one stage, the selection and appointment of the appellant by
a duly constituted Board against a temporary post in accordance with rules
against a permanent post and her continuance for nine years coupled with
inaction of the Government to take any steps to fill the post through
Commission thus preventing the appellant from availing of any opportunity
for regular selection was bothering us. But when the Under Secretary in the
Medical Department filed the additional affidavit on direction of this
Court what transpired indicated that in fact the appellant has continued
partly because of the circumstance that the regularly selected candidate
did not join and partly due to interim orders granted by the courts. In the
affidavit it is stated that advertisement for regular selection through
Commission was issued by the Government on 13th January 1984 for the post
of Lecturer in Dentistry. The appellant along with others applied for the
same but it was one Dr. S.C. Bhoir who was selected and posted as Lecturer
in BJ. Medical College, Pune. He, however, did not join due to certain
unavoidable circumstances. The affidavit states that it was due to this
reason that the appellant continued as temporary lecturer even when she was
not selected by the commission. The appellant, therefore, cannot make any
grievance that she was not afforded any opportunity to become regular
through appointment by the Commission. And unfortunately for her when the
post was advertised again in 1988 the eligibility criteria had changed
under Maharashtra Medical an Re-search Services Class-II in Directorate of
Medical and Research (Recruitment) Rules, 1986, yet she has continued till
now on strength of interim Orders granted in her favour first from the High
Court, continued by the Tribunal and then by this Court. The interim orders
have already caused enough injury to the selected candidate.
</p>
<p id="p_13">In the result this appeal fails and is dismissed. But there shall be no
order as to costs.
