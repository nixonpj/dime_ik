<pre id="pre_1">           CASE NO.:
Special Leave Petition (civil)  8439 of 2007

PETITIONER:
Harvinder Kaur Sabharwal

RESPONDENT:
Navneet Kaur

DATE OF JUDGMENT: 09/04/2008

BENCH:
Tarun Chatterjee &amp; Harjit Singh Bedi

JUDGMENT:
</pre><p id="p_1">JUDGMENT
O R D E R
SPECIAL LEAVE PETITION ) NO.8439 OF 2007 



</p><p id="p_2">1.	    The petitioner in this special leave petition is a tenant in respect of 
Booth No.22, Sector 34-C, Chandigarh in the State of Punjab (in short 'the 
demised premises) who has been sought to be evicted by the respondent on 
the ground that she required the demised premises for her personal use and 
for opening a retail-cum-wholesale shop of garments in the demised 
premises which was a non-residential building. The Rent Controller 
dismissed the application of the landlady/respondent. Feeling aggrieved, an 
appeal was carried before the appellate authority which had reversed the 
finding on  the  question  of  bona  fide  requirement  and




directed eviction of the petitioner. Against the order of eviction passed by the 
appellate authority reversing the order of rejection passed by the Rent 
Controller, the petitioner approached the High Court for setting aside the order 
of the appellate authority. The High Court by the impugned order has rejected 
the  application filed by the tenant/petitioner against which this special leave 
petition  has  been filed which was heard on notice in presence of the learned 
counsel for the parties.
</p><p id="p_3">2.	     Mr.P.K.Ghosh, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the 
tenant/petitioner sought to argue that  in order to come to a conclusion on the 
question of bona fide requirement of the landlady/ respondent, the High Court 
as well as the appellate authority had failed to consider the material provisions 
of the Act as well as the material evidence on record for which the decree 
could be passed in favour of the landlady. For this purpose, we   have  
examined  the  finding  of  the  appellate









authority as well as of the High Court and we find that  the High Court as well 
as the appellate authority on  consideration  of  the material evidence,  oral  and  
documentary, came to a conclusion of fact that the landlady/respondent was 
entitled  to  an order of eviction. Mr. Ghosh, however, could not satisfy us by 
showing that the findings on  the  question  of bona fide requirement of the 
landlady/respondent was either perverse or arbitrary or they had failed to 
consider the provisions of the Act for grant of an order of eviction. That  being  
the  position and in view of the fact  that this special leave petition is concluded  
by the concurrent finding of fact arrived at by the  appellate  authority  as well 
as by the High Court  on  the  question of bona fide requirement, we have no 
other alternative but to dismiss the special leave petition. Accordingly, this 
special leave petition is rejected.
</p>







<p id="p_4">	3. Considering the facts and circumstances of the case, we grant time to the 
petitioner to vacate the premises in question by 31st of March, 2009, subject to 
filing a usual undertaking in this Court within four weeks from this date.
