                                 C.O. 2455 of 2008


                    This revisional application is directed against the order dated 18.06.2008
              passed in Title Suit No. 805 of 1997 by the learned Civil Judge, 2nd Court,
              Sealdah whereby the learned Court below allowed the petition under Section 151
              of the Code of Civil Procedure allowing the defendants/opposite parties to deposit
              the arrear rent.
</p><p id="p_3">                    The factual background leading to the presentation of this revisional
              application in brief is that the petitioner/plaintiff is the owner of two storeyed "
              Thika Mud Kotha"      house situated at premises no. 13/8, Hazi Zakaria Lane
              under the Manicktala Police Station, Calcutta - 700 006. There are 8 rooms in
              the said house in the ground floor. Out of those 8 rooms, 7 rooms are in
              occupation of different tenants and one room is in occupation of the
              petitioner/plaintiff where he runs his business under name and style "Baba
              Lokenath Rubber Band". In the first floor, there are six rooms. Out of those 6
              rooms, 2 rooms are in possession of different tenants and the rest 4 rooms are in
              occupation of the petitioner/plaintiff.   One Bhanu Hazra, the predecessor of
              opposite parties/defendants was the tenant under the petitioner/plaintiff in
              respect of 2 rooms, cooking space on Varandah in the ground floor of the
              premises in question at a monthly rent of Rs.80/- payable according to English
              Calendar month. On the death of Bhanu Hazra, the present opposite
              parties/defendants    succeeded     the   said   tenancy    and    requested    the
              petitioner/plaintiff to issue rent bills in their names. The rent was enhanced to
              Rs.180/- per month from June, 1989. They became tenants in respect of the said
              premises since June, 1989. The opposite parties/defendants did not pay the rent
              for the period from February, 1993 to April, 1993. Thereafter, they sent rent by
              postal money order from May, 1993 to December, 1993. Again they failed to pay
              rent from January, 1994 and became a habitual defaulter since January, 1994.
              There is further case that the opposite parties/defendants has also sublet the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                          2</span>


suit premises to other persons without any knowledge and consent of the
petitioner/plaintiff. The petitioner/plaintiff finding no option filed the suit being
Title Suit no. 805 of 1997 for ejectment and recovery of possession.
</p><p id="p_4">      The opposite parties/defendants entered appearance in that suit, contested
it by filing written statement. They filed an application under Section 151 of the
Code of Civil Procedure praying for an order so that they can deposit the rent for
the period from October, 2005 to November, 2007. Learned Court below allowed
the said petition by passing the impugned order. So this revisional application.
</p><p id="p_5">      None appears to represent the petitioner as well as the opposite
parties/defendants.
</p><p id="p_6">      Perused the impugned order. It transpires therefrom that the learned court
below considered the prayer      of the opposite parties/defendants and allowed
them to deposit the rent for the period from October, 2005 to November, 2007.
There is no odd in the order itself. Moreover, the petitioner is not interested in
this matter.
</p><p id="p_7">      The revisional application has no merit. It is dismissed.
      Interim order, if any, stands vacated.
</p>
