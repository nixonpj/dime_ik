     THESE APPEALS AND CROSS-OBJECTIONS COMING ON
FOR ORDERS THIS DAY, THE COURT, DELIVERED THE
FOLLOWING:

                          JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">      MFA No.21253/2012, MFA No.21254/2012 and MFA

No.21242/2012      have     been     preferred    by    the

appellant/insurer assailing the judgment and award dated

22.11.2011, passed by the Senior Civil Judge, Asst. Sessions

Judge and Member Additional M.A.C.T., Bailhongal, in MVC

No.588/2010, MVC No.589/2010 and MVC No.2693/2009.

MFA Crob.100065/2014 and MFA Crob.100066/2014 have

been preferred by the cross-objectors/claimants assailing
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                               8</span>




the judgment and award passed dated 22.11.2011, passed

by the Senior Civil Judge, Asst. Sessions Judge and Member

Additional M.A.C.T., Bailhongal, in MVC No.588/2010,

589/2010. The Tribunal by its judgment and award allowed

the claim petitions in part by fastening the liability on both

the vehicle and the insurers of both the vehicles are directed

to indemnify the claim in the ratio of 80% and 20%.


</p><p id="p_2">      2.    I have heard the arguments advanced by Sri. S.

V. Yaji, the learned counsel for the appellant/insurer of

tempo trax and Smt. Geeta K. M. @ Pawar, the learned

counsel for respondent/owner of the tempo trax and Sri.

G.N. Raichur, the learned counsel appearing for the

respondent/insurer of the lorry.
</p>
<p id="p_3">
</p><p id="p_4">      3.    It is the contention of the learned counsel

appearing for the appellant/insurer of tempo trax that the

Tribunal has committed serious error in directing the

appellant/insurer of tempo trax to indemnify the claim by

apportioning the liability to the extent of 80% when the

material records clearly indicates the fact the accident in

question has occurred due to parking of the lorry bearing
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                9</span>




No.KA-40/3698 in the middle of the road, without any

indication   and   parking   light.   There   has   been   non-

consideration of material aspects mainly that the FIR and

Charge sheet has been filed against the driver of both the

vehicles but the Tribunal has erroneously fastened the

liability on the appellant/insurer of the tempo trax to the

extent of 80%. He seeks for setting aside the impugned

judgment and award passed by the Tribunal and prays for

fastening the entire liability on the insured and insurer of

the lorry.
</p>
<p id="p_5">
</p><p id="p_6">      4.     Per contra, the learned counsel appearing for the

appellant/insurer of the lorry has argued by justifying the

judgment and award      passed by the Tribunal. He further

contended that the Tribunal has rightly fastened the liability

to the extent of 80% on the insurer of the tempo trax as the

driver of the tempo trax dashed the parked lorry without

taking due care and caution as expected by the prudent

driver and if he could have taken the due care and caution,

the accident could have been avoided. The alleged accident

occurred on his own negligent and not on the negligent act
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                               10</span>




on the part of the driver of the lorry. The driver of the lorry

had parked the lorry by side of the road. The Tribunal after

going through the records has rightly fastened the liability to

the extent of 80% on the insurer of the tempo trax and to the

extent of 20% on the insurer of the lorry. There is no

infirmity in the order passed by the Tribunal and hence he

prayed for dismissal of all the appeals by confirming the

judgment and award passed by the Tribunal.


</p><p id="p_7">      5.    The learned counsel appearing for the cross-

objectors/claimants has also argued by supporting the

judgment and award passed by the Tribunal to the extent of

fastening of the liability and prayed for dismissal of the

appeals preferred by the appellant/insurer. He further

contended that the compensation awarded by the Tribunal is

on the lower side as the monthly income taken by the

Tribunal for assessing the compensation is on the lower side.

In that light he prayed for allowing the cross-objections by

enhancing the compensation awarded by the Tribunal.


</p><p id="p_8">      6.    Having heard the learned counsel appearing for

the parties and on perusal of the judgment and award in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                              11</span>




question it would indicate that road on which the accident in

question occurred is running East-West.        It is a State

Highway from Belgaum to Bagalkot and also runs vice-versa.

Tempo trax bearing registration No.KA-24/M-1905 was

proceeding from Belgaum towards Bagalkot i.e., East to West

and lorry bearing registration No.KA 40/3698 had been

parked on the edge of the road facing West. Accident in

question occurred around 8 p.m. Undisputedly, there was

no light in the said area and adjacent to the asphalted road

on either side of the road, there is 5 ft kaccha road. The

driver of the lorry had parked the said lorry on the center of

the road and if the same had been parked on the kaccha

road, accident could have been avoided. Likewise, the driver

of lorry after having parked the said vehicle on the center of

the road ought to have switched on the parking lights to

avoid the accident in question. Driver of the said lorry had

not taken any care and caution to ensure that the vehicles

coming from the hind side would notice about said lorry

having been parked on the middle of the road either by

putting up a barricade by using stones as is done in such
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                               12</span>




circumstances by the drivers to avoid accident. This would

only indicate that driver of the lorry has also contributed to

the alleged accident by parking his vehicle on the middle of

the road.   The driver of tempo trax while proceeding from

East to West also should have visualized about the vehicles

having been parked by the side of road and he is expected to

be vigilant, careful and cautious to avoid any such possibility

and it is expected of a prudent driver to anticipate such

incidents. On account of the speed in which he was

proceeding, obviously, he could not avoid the accident

particularly when the lorry had been parked on the middle of

the road.   As such, he has rammed his tempo trax to the

hind side of the lorry resulting in all the inmates of tempo

trax namely the passengers sustaining grievous injuries and

also resulting in death of two persons.     The Investigating

Authorities having been taken investigation based on the

complaint has proceeded to register the complaint against

drivers of both the vehicles. On conclusion of investigation,

a charge-sheet has also been filed against drivers of both the

vehicles. Despite such evidence being available on record,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                               13</span>




Tribunal has held that there are no independent witnesses to

prove the nature of accident. On the other hand, inmates of

the tempo trax who came to be examined as PWs-2 to PWs-

13 have in their cross-examination stated that lorry was

parked without indicators, without keeping stones or wooden

pieces and it was parked on the middle of the road.        The

suggestion made to these witnesses in the cross-examination

that the accident was on account of the driver of the tempo

trax having not avoided the oncoming vehicle has been

denied by them. In view of the fact that eye witnesses to the

accident who are none other than the inmates of the tempo

trax having categorically stated that on account of lorry

having been parked in the middle of the road, accident in

question had occurred and also in view of the fact that the

jurisdictional police having filed charge-sheet against drivers

of both the vehicles, negligence attributable to the drivers of

both the vehicles is to be apportioned in the ratio of 50:50

and not 80:20 between tempo trax driver and lorry driver as

opined by the Tribunal.

</p><p id="p_10">      7.      At this juncture the learned counsel for the

appellant/insurer of the tempo trax brought to my notice

that in the judgment passed by this Court in MFA

No.21243/2012 to 21252/2012, arising out of the same

accident, therein this Court has already held that the drivers

of both the vehicles have contributed to the alleged accident

in the ratio of 50:50. By going through the said judgment

and award, it is clear that this Court has apportioned the

liability on both the insurers in the ratio of 50:50 . In that

light, the contention taken up by the learned counsel for the

appellant/insurer of tempo trax appears to be having force in

law and the same is liable to be accepted. In that light, the

apportionment is fixed on both the vehicles on the ratio of

50:50 each.
</p>
<p id="p_11">
</p><p id="p_12">      8.      It is the further contention of the learned

counsel for the appellant/insurer of the tempo trax that his

liability is only to the extent of 11 persons in the tempo trax

as the said policy is an Act policy and extra premium has

been collected to cover the risk of 11 persons to the extent of

Rs.1,00,000/- per passenger. It is well settled principles of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                  15</span>




law laid down by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of

<a href="/doc/1633949/" id="a_1">National Insurance Co. Ltd v. Anjana Shyam and others</a>,

reported in (2007) 7 Supreme Court Cases 445 in para No.

22 and 24, which is observed as under;
</p>
<p id="p_13">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">     22. Then arises the question, how to determine the
     compensation      payable    or how        to    quantify     the
     compensation      since     there    is     no        means    of
     ascertaining who out of the overloaded passengers
     constitute the passengers covered by the insurance
     policy as permitted to be carried by the permit itself.
     As this Court has indicated, the purpose of the Act is
     to bring benefit to the third parties who are either
     injured or dead in an accident. It serves a social
     purpose. Keeping that in mind, we think that the
     practical and proper course would be to hold that the
     insurance company, in such a case, would be bound
     to cover the higher of the various awards and will be
     compelled to deposit the higher of the amounts of
     compensation awarded to the extent of the number
     of passengers covered by the insurance policy.</blockquote><p id="p_14">


</p><p id="p_15">     23. Illustratively, we may put it like this. In the case
     on   hand,   42    passengers       were        the    permitted
     passengers and they are the ones who have been
     insured by the insurance company. 90 persons have
     either died or got injured in the accident. Awards
     have been passed for varied sums. The Tribunal
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                          16</span>




should take into account the higher of the 42 awards
made, add them up and direct the insurance
company to deposit that lump sum. Thus, the
liability of the insurance company would be to pay
the compensation awarded to 42 out of the 90
passengers. It is to ensure that the maximum benefit
is derived by the insurance taken for the passengers
of the vehicle, that we hold that the 42 awards to be
satisfied by the insurance company would be the 42
awards in the descending order starting from the
highest of the awards. In other words, the higher of
the 42 awards will be taken into account and it
would be the sum total of those higher 42 awards
that would be the amount that the insurance
company would be liable to deposit. It will be for the
Tribunal thereafter to direct distribution of the
money so deposited by the insurance company
proportionately to all the claimants, here all the 90,
and leave all the claimants to recover the balance
from the owner of the vehicle. In such cases, it will
be necessary for the Tribunal, even at the initial
stage, to make appropriate orders to ensure that the
amount could be recovered from the owner by
ordering attachment or by passing other restrictive
orders against the owner so as to ensure the
satisfaction in full of the awards that may be passed
ultimately.
</p>
<p id="p_16">
</p><p id="p_17">24. In these cases, we find that this Court has not
issued notices to the claimants. We are therefore not
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                  17</span>




     in a position to vary the decision of the High Court as
     regards the claimants. But, we have clarified the law
     on the question and we grant the insurance company
     a decree to recover the excess amount that it has
     deposited, from the owner, who has been issued
     notice    and   who   has   contested    these   appeals.
     Obviously, the principle indicated by us here will
     have to be applied by the Tribunal in the case from
     which the appeal against the interim award has been
     filed by the insurance company.

<a href="/doc/1950052/" id="a_2">Divisional     Manager,     National       Insurance       Company

Limited, Hubli v. Smt. Laxmawwa and others</a>, reported in

2009 (1) Kar. L. J. 625 (DB) has observed as under;

     Motor accident - Injury - Compensation - Permit liability -
     Liability of insurer when owner committed breach of
     contract - Injured claim compensation - Tribunal allowed
     claim petition in part - Insurer appealed - Argued that
     vehicle involved was a Maxi Cab the capacity of which was
     12 + 1 and policy of insurance was issued covering risk of
     only 12 passengers plus driver - Also alleged that vehicle
     was overloaded with 35 passengers - Hence owner
     committed breach of contract and as such insurer not

      also claim from owner as the Insurance Company not
      satisfying the awards of more than twelve persons where
      risk covered by policy - Tribunal is right in decreeing part.</blockquote><p id="p_19">


</p><p id="p_20">      10.    It is a well settled preposition of law that if the

insurance     policy    covers     only     permitted      number     of

passengers, in such a case, insurer's liability held limited by

the insurance taken out for the number of permitted

passengers. It does not extend to the amounts decreed in

respect of other passengers but harmonious construction of

the provision and law laid down by the Apex Court. Therein

the Hon'ble Apex Court has observed that the proper course

for quantification of the compensation payable by the

insurer, in a case, where the insured passengers and other

passengers could not be identified, insurance company is

bound to cover and accordingly deposit higher of the

amounts of the compensation awarded and the remaining

portion of the amount also has to be paid by the insurer.

Then the lowest of the amount has to be recovered from the

owner of the insured vehicle and that is the settled principle

of law. Accordingly the insurer is hereby directed to follow
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                               19</span>




the ratio laid down in the cases quoted supra and deposit

the amount accordingly in terms of the policy condition.

passed by the Tribunal in MVC No.588/2010 therein, the

claimant has suffered injury to left upper lip and he has lost

three upper teeth and injury to his chest and he was also

inpatient for two days, it is the contention of the learned

counsel for the appellant that the claimant has lost three

upper teeth.   The Tribunal has not considered the loss of

marriage prospects as he was not married and the Tribunal

has also not taken the income, which was prevailing during

the said period. In order to substantiate the said fact that he

has suffered the injuries, he has produced the wound

certificate as per Ex.P145 and disability certificate as per

Ex.P149.

<p id="p_22">
</p><p id="p_23">      12.   It is the contention of the petitioner that as on

the date of accident, he was agriculturist and LIC agent. But

in order to substantiate the said fact, he has not produced

any documents. But the Tribunal       by taking the notional

income at Rs.3,500/- and by relying upon the evidence of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                               20</span>




PW17 the Doctor, has awarded the compensation as

mentioned below:
</p>
<pre id="pre_2"> 1    Pain and suffering                                  7,000/-
 2    Medicine and hospital charges                       5,400/-
 3    Nourishment charges                                   500/-
 4    Attendant and conveyance charges                    1,500/-
 5    Loss of income during t5reatment                    3,500/-

 6    Loss   of    amenities   and   future               2,000/-
      unhappiness
                                  Total Rs.              19,900/-

</pre><p id="p_24">      13.     Though under the normal circumstances, the

compensation awarded by the Tribunal appears to be

justifiable, but at the time of taking the notional income the

Tribunal ought to have kept into view the year of accident

and   wages    prevailing   during   that   particular   period.

Admittedly, the accident is of the year 2009 and during that

particular period the notional income at Rs.5,000/- is the

yardstick, which even used to be adopted in the settlement

of cases before Lok Adalath. If that were to be adopted and

the injuries if they are considered with reference to the

avocation and there is no disability, as such, the Tribunal

has rightly held that the said loss of teeth and other injuries

is not going to come in the way of loss of future earning. But
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">                                21</span>




the Tribunal has awarded the compensation on the other

heads is on the lower side.         In that light, the appellant-

claimant is entitled to some compensation.        In the light of

the injuries suffered and loss of teeth is going to affect the

future marriage prospects, in that light, the appellant-

claimant is entitled to an amount of Rs.30,000/- towards

pain and suffering, an amount of Rs.5,400/- towards

medical expenses, an amount of Rs. 6,000/- towards

attendant charges, conveyance, diet, nourishment and other

incidental charges.     Loss of income during laid off period

Rs.10,000/- loss of amenities and discomfort Rs.30,000 and

loss   of    marriage   prospectus    Rs.50,000/-.   In   all   the

appellant-claimant is entitled to a total compensation of

Rs.1,31,400/- after deducting the compensation awarded by

the Tribunal to the extent of Rs.19,900/- the appellant-

claimant is entitled to an additional compensation of

Rs.1,11,500/- with interest @ 6%.

</p><p id="p_26">       14.    In so far as, the judgment and award in MVC

No.589/2010 is concerned, therein, the appellant-claimant

has suffered fracture of right hip joint, fracture of both nasal

bones, fracture of left orbit, fracture of maxillary bone,

fracture of zygomatic arch, injury to right eyebrow, upper lip

and other injuries. In order to substantiate the said fact, he

has also produced the wound certificate as per Ex.P173. He

has also produced the disability certificate and has got

examined the Doctor as PW14. he has deposed that as per

Ex.P183, the claimant has suffered a disability to the extent

of 20%, but he is not a treated Doctor. In that light, if the

income is taken at Rs.5,000/- and if the disability is taken at

5%, then under such circumstances, it is going to meet the

ends of justice. But, as could be seen from the judgment and

award p[assed by the Tribunal, the compensation under the

head of pain and suffering, loss of amenities and discomfort,

loss of income during laid up period are all on the higher

side.   In that light, if an amount of Rs.50,000/- awarded

globally by keeping in view the injuries and other things,

then it is going to meet the ends of justice.    In that light,

globally an amount of Rs.50,000/- has been awarded,        the

remaining compensation which has been awarded by the

Tribunal is kept intact. Globally an amount of Rs.50,000/-
