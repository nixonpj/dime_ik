    was 36 years of age and was working as Up-Vayas and also doing





    the business of Mushroom growing and Karyana Shop and was

    earning Rs.22,000/- per month.

<p id="p_10">    3.          Respondents No. 5 and 6 and appellant contested the

    conditions of the Insurance Policy and the <a href="/doc/785258/" id="a_2">Motor Vehicles Act</a> and




    the compensation claimed was highly excessive. The learned

    Tribunal below, after framing issues in the matter and recording





    evidence of the parties, allowed the claim petition and has





    awarded a sum of Rs.15,82,000/- alongwith interest at the rate of

    7.5% per annum from the date of the petition in their favour and

<p id="p_13">                I have heard learned counsel for the parties and have





    gone through the records of the case.
</p>
<p id="p_14">    5.          Evidently, there is nothing on record to prove that the





    income of the deceased was Rs.10,000/- per month as has been

    computed by the learned Tribunal below. Therefore, in such

    circumstances, the income of the deceased can at best be taken to

    be that of a daily wager/agriculturist labourer, which was revised to

    Rs.180/- per day w.e.f. 01.05.2015 or Rs.5400/- per month.

                Now, as regards the award of compensation, there can

    be no dispute that the compensation awarded by the learned




    Tribunal is now required to be determined in accordance with the

    decision of a Constitutional Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in





    National Insurance Co. Ltd. versus Pranay Sethi and others





    2017 ACJ 2700.
</p>
<p id="p_16">    7.          Why this case came to be referred to the Constitutional

    Bench, the answer is not difficult to find and the same is set out in

    para-1 of the judgment itself which reads thus:

<p id="p_17">    8.          The conflict between the judgments as extracted





    above was resolved by concluding that the decision in Rajesh

    versus Rajbir Singh, 2013 ACJ 1403 (SC) was not a binding





    precedent as it had not taken note of the decision in Reshma

    Kumari versus Madan Mohan, 2013 ACJ 1253(SC). The Hon'ble

    Supreme Court after considering the entire conspectus of law


    arrived at the following conclusions:-
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_3">                "i) The two-Judge Bench in Santosh Devi, 2012 ACJ 1428 (SC),
                should have been well advised to refer the matter to a larger


                Bench as it was taking a different view than what has been
                stated in Sarla Verma, 2009 ACJ 1298 (SC), a judgment by a
                coordinate Bench. It is because a coordinate Bench of the
                same strength cannot take a contrary view than what has been




                held by another coordinate Bench.

                decision in Reshma Kumari,2013 ACJ 1253 (SC), which was
                delivered at earlier point of time, the decision in Rajesh is not a

                age of 40 years, should be made. The addition should be 30%,
                if the age of the deceased was between 40 and 50 years. In
                case the deceased was between the age of 50 and 60 years,

<blockquote id="blockquote_12">        "14. Though in some cases the deduction to be made towards
        personal and living expenses is calculated on the basis of units
        indicated in Trilok Chandra's case, 1996 ACJ 831 (SC), the

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_13">        general practice is to apply standardized deductions. Having





        considered several subsequent decisions of this court, we are
        of the view that where the deceased was married, the
        deduction towards personal and living expenses of the





        deceased, should be one-third (1/3rd) where the number of
        dependent family members is 2 to 3, one-fourth (1/4th) where
        the number of dependant family members is 4 to 6, and one-
        fifth (1/5th) where the number of dependant family members





        exceed six.
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_14">        15. Where the deceased was a bachelor and the claimants are

        the parents, the deduction follows a different principle. In
        regard to bachelors, normally, 50% is deducted as personal

        and living expenses, because it is assumed that a bachelor
        would tend to spend more on himself. Even otherwise, there is
        also the possibility of his getting married in a short time, in


        which event the contribution to the parent/s and siblings is
        likely to be cut drastically. Further, subject to evidence to the
        contrary, the father is likely to have his own income and will




        not be considered as a dependant and the mother alone will be
        considered as a dependent. In the absence of evidence to the





        contrary, brothers and sisters will not be considered as
        dependents, because they will either be independent and





        earning, or married, or be dependant on the father. Thus even
        if the deceased is survived by parents and siblings, only the
        mother would be considered to be a dependant, and 50%
        would be treated as the personal and living expenses of the
        bachelor and 50% as the contribution to the family. However,
        where family of the bachelor is large and dependant on the
        income of the deceased, as in a case where he has a widowed
        mother and large number of younger non-earning sisters or
        brothers, his personal and living expenses may be restricted to

</p><p id="p_22">     11.          Evidently, the judgment in Pranay Sethi's case




                                                                   .
</p>
<p id="p_23">     (supra) has brought about radical and fundamental changes with

     regard to award of compensation. For this purpose, this Court





     would deal with the case by drawing a comparative table of the

     amount actually awarded by the learned Tribunal along with





     modified award.
</p>
<p id="p_24">     12.          Bearing in mind the aforesaid exposition of law and the

     law laid down in Pranay Sethi's case (supra), it would be


     noticed that the deceased at best can be taken to be a daily

     wager/agriculturist labourer and, therefore, only an increase of

     40% towards notional income can be made in his favour. Since, the



     petitioner was married, 1/4th deduction has to be made towards

     personal expenses. The deceased was about 36 years of age,




     therefore, the multiplier of 15 as applied by the learned Tribunal





     below appears to be perfectly in order. In addition thereto, the

     conventional charges of Rs.70,000/-, as awarded by the learned





     Tribunal below are in tune with the law laid down in Pranay

     Sethi's case (supra).

<p id="p_25">     13.          In view of the aforesaid discussion, the compensation

     that would eventually work out is as under:-

     Company has failed to deposit the amount within the period


     granted to it and, therefore, liable to pay interest at the rate of 9%

     per annum from the date of award in terms thereof.
</p>
<p id="p_36">     15.          To be fair to the learned Counsel for the Insurance



     Company, even this finding of the learned Tribunal whereby the




     interest initially at the rate of 7.5% per annum has been awarded,

     in case, the same is paid within two months and thereafter at the





     rate of 9% per annum, has been questioned by the Insurance





     Company. However, taking into account the peculiar facts and

     circumstances of the case, more particularly, the fact that the

     compensation stands drastically reduced, I see no reason to

     interfere with such findings of the learned Tribunal.
