<p id="p_1">     The petitioner has filed this petition under <a href="/doc/136948773/" id="a_1">Section 166</a> of

MV Act for claiming compensation for the injuries sustained in a

MV Accident.
</p>
<p id="p_2">     2. The brief facts of the petitioner's case are as follows:

     On 12.02.2014 at about 9.50 p.m., the petitioner proceeding

along with Eshwar on motor cycle bearing reg. No. KA-43-H-273

as a pillion rider. The said Eshwar riding the motor cycle on

service road, near Kannamangala gate, Devanahalli. At that time a

Tata Indica car bearing reg. No. KA-03-D-9012 came from

opposite direction with high speed in a rash and negligent manner

dashed to the motor cycle. As such, both fell down and sustained

injuries. The petitioner was taken to Shushrusha Nursing Home,

Yelahanka, wherein he took treatment as inpatient from 12.2.2014

to 14.2.2014. He spent more than Rs.1,00,000/- for treatment

and other expenses.    The petitioner also spent Rs.10,000/- for

repair of the TVS motor cycle.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_1"> SCCH-17                         3                    MVC 1463-2014</span><p id="p_3">


</p><p id="p_4">     The petitioner contend that he was aged 41 years and

working as a car driver under different employers and earning

Rs.20,000/- p.m. Because of the accidental injuries he was unable

to earn the same.    The accident caused by the negligence of

driver of car which is owned by respondent No.1 and insured with

respondent No.2. Hence, both are liable to pay compensation to

the petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_5">     3.    On the contrary respondent No.2 filed written

statement by denying the contention of petitioner. Apart from

the denial this respondent contends that their insured vehicle not

at all involved in the accident. They came to know about the

accident only after receipt of summons from this court. Police

and owner were not submitted necessary documents to them.

</p><p id="p_6">     Further this respondent contends that the alleged accident

caused by the negligence of rider of motor cycle.      They also

contend that the petitioner was riding motor cycle, hence, it is

his negligence to cause the accident. As per the sketch rider of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2"> SCCH-17                             4                       MVC 1463-2014</span>


the moped taking a deviation from BB Main Road to service road

to the extreme right side and dashed to the car.                  Further

contend that the alleged accident has taken place on 12.2.2014,

but the complaint lodged on 19.2.2014. There is a delay of 7 days

in filing the complaint. Since there is no negligence on the part of

driver of the car they are not liable to pay any compensation to

the petitioner. Further they contend that they have insured the

car, hence if any liability on their part, it is subject to validity of

documents and DL of the driver in force. Hence, prayed to reject

the claim petition filed against them.

documents the petitioner in order to establish his case apart

from his evidence got marked several documents. On perusal of

the said documents Ex.P.1 is the FIR, Ex.P.2- complaint, Ex.P.3-

</p>
<p id="p_15">
</p><p id="p_16">     From these documents it shows that there is an accident in

which the petitioner sustained injuries and has taken treatment.

As per Ex.P.2- complaint Eshwar the rider of motor cycle filed

complaint on 19.2.2014 in which he has stated that on 12.2.2014
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5"> SCCH-17                          7                   MVC 1463-2014</span>


at about 9.50 p.m. he was proceeding on TVS motor cycle of

Ravindra, at that time a car came from opposite direction dashed

to their TVS motor cycle, as such the petitioner sustained

injuries. He also sustained injuries which are simple. With the

help of public and Hoysala police they have been shifted to

Shushrusha Hospital. Since owner or the driver of the car not

turned out, he filed complaint on 19.2.2014.      Ex.P.3- copy of

intimation given by the hospital authority to the police, on

13.2.2014.   Ex.P.4 charge sheet and Ex.P.9 discharge summary

shows that the petitioner sustained injuries in a road traffic

accident at about 9.50 p.m. on 12.2.2014. Prescriptions and case

sheets show that the petitioner sustained injuries.     From the

documents and evidence of the petitioner it shows that he

sustained injuries in a motor vehicle accident.


</p><p id="p_17">     On the contrary, respondent contend that their vehicle not

at all involved in the accident. Moreover, they also contend that
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6"> SCCH-17                          8                    MVC 1463-2014</span>


the petitioner might have sustained injuries in some other

incident and filed a false complaint against their insured vehicle.

They also took contention that in the hospital records the vehicle

number is not mentioned. Moreover, there is a delay of 7 days in

lodging the complaint etc., IN order to establish their contention

respondent No.2 not produced any iota of evidence. Even from

the cross-examination of P.w.1 they were not elicited anything to

disbelieve the version of petitioner. Moreover, as per law, merely

there is a delay in filing the complaint, will not discard the

contention petitioner.     Moreover, the petitioner produced

hospital records, which shows that he sustained injuries in the

accident. It is the duty of the respondent to establish that how

the petitioner sustained injuries. But in order to establish the

same they have not produced any evidence, Under such

circumstances, the contention of respondent not holds good.

Accordingly, from the evidence and documents it shows that the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7"> SCCH-17                          9                      MVC 1463-2014</span>


petitioner made that he sustained injuries in the motor vehicle

accident. Accordingly, I answer issue no.1 in the affirmative.


</p><p id="p_18">     9. ISSUE NO.2:
</p>
<p id="p_19">
     The petitioner produced wound certificate, discharge

summary, medical bills and examined the doctor. On that basis he

is entitled for compensation on the following heads:


</p><pre id="pre_2">     a.    PAIN AND AGONY:-              As per Ex.P.8 - wound

certificate petitioner sustained two injuries.    One is abrasion

over both knees which are simple in nature.        For that he is

</pre><p id="p_20">entitled for compensation of Rs.4,000/-. Injury No.2 is fracture

to lower end of left radius, which is grievous in nature. For that

he is entitled for compensation of Rs.20,000/-.          Totally the

petitioner is   entitled   for   compensation of       Rs.24,000/-.

Accordingly, same is awarded.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_8"> SCCH-17                         10                     MVC 1463-2014</span><p id="p_21">


</p><p id="p_22">     b.    MEDICAL     EXPENSES:- The petitioner produced

medical bills   as per Ex.P.11 for Rs.15,560/-      Looking to the

injuries sustained and treatment taken it shows that he might

have spent the same. Hence, he is entitled for the said medical

expenses of Rs.15,560/-. Accordingly, same is awarded.


</p><p id="p_23">     c.    LOSS OF INCOME;           The petitioner contend that he

was a driver and earning Rs.20,000/- p.m.          Because of the

accidental injuries it is not possible for him to drive the vehicle

hence, he was permanently disabled.         The petitioner though

contends that he sustained loss of income, but he has not

produced any document to show that what is the period for which

he was idle. As per the discharge summary, he took treatment as

inpatient for 3 days. He sustained fracture injury to the left

hand, naturally it may take atleast 2 months to recover from the

said injuries. Hence, I am of the opinion that he is entitled for

the loss of income for 2 months. The petitioner contend that he
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9"> SCCH-17                         11                    MVC 1463-2014</span>


was earning Rs.20,000/-p.m, but he has not produced any material

to show the same. Even he has not produced DL to establish that

he was a driver.     Under such circumstances, his income is

considered on notional basis for Rs.6,000/-p.m.      Hence, he is

entitled for Rs.6,000 x 2 months= Rs.12,000/-. Accordingly,

same is awarded.
</p>
<p id="p_24">
</p><p id="p_25">     d.    DISABILTY:- The petitioner contend that because of

the accidental injuries he was subjected to permanent disability

and not able to drive the vehicle, as such he sustained loss of

income. But neither produced DL nor any evidence to show that

he was earning Rs.20,000/- p.m. As already discussed above, his

income is considered for Rs.6,000/-p.m. The petitioner in order

to support his disability examined the doctor as P.w.3 who

deposed that he examined the petitioner only for assessing the

disability and not treated. He opined that the petitioner is having
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10"> SCCH-17                         12                    MVC 1463-2014</span>


a disability to an extent of 19% to the left upper limb and for the

whole body assessed 7%.
</p>
<p id="p_26">
</p><p id="p_27">     In the cross-examination respondent not elicited anything

to disbelieve the version of doctor. So, from the evidence and

documents it show that when the petitioner sustained fracture

injury, naturally he might be having certain disability. Normally

when he sustained fracture injury to the left hand it may have

the disability. Moreover fracture is         united and treated

conservatively. Considering that aspect, I am of the opinion that

atleast 5% disability is to be considered to the petitioner. The

age of the petitioner is 41 years, the appropriate multiplier

applicable is 14.     Hence, the petitioner is entitled for

compensation of Rs. 6,000 x 12 x 14 x 5/100= Rs.50,400/-.

Accordingly, same is awarded.
</p>
<p id="p_28">
</p><p id="p_29">     e.    ATTENDANT CHARGES: As the petitioner was

treated as inpatient for about 3 days as he sustained fracture
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11"> SCCH-17                        13                        MVC 1463-2014</span>


injury. Hence, looking to the injuries sustained and treatment

taken, he could not attend to his work for a period of 1 month.

Hence, considering this aspect he is entitled for compensation of

Rs.3,000/-x1month = Rs.3,000/- under the head attendant

charges. Accordingly, same is awarded.
</p>
<p id="p_30">
</p><p id="p_31">     f.    FOOD     AND   NOURISHMENT;            Further    as   the

petitioner was treated as inpatient for about 3 days as he

sustained fracture injury to the left hand. Hence, looking to the

injuries sustained and treatment taken, he is entitled for

compensation   of   Rs.5,000/-      under   the   head     food   and

nourishment. Accordingly, same is awarded.


</p><p id="p_32">     Thus, the petitioner is entitled for compensation under the

following heads:
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_12"> SCCH-17                          14                 MVC 1463-2014</span><p id="p_33">


</p><pre id="pre_3">     a) Towards pain and agony             Rs.    24,000/-

     b) Towards medical expenses           Rs.    15,560/-

     c) Towards loss of income             Rs.    12,000/-

     d) Towards disability                 Rs.   50,400/-

     e) Towards attendant                  Rs.     3,000/-

     f) Towards food and nourishment       Rs.     5,000/-

                             Total         Rs. 1,09,960/-



</pre><p id="p_34">     10.   LIABILITY; The petitioner contend that the accident

caused by the negligence of driver of tata Indica car. Both the

respondents being owner and insurer are liable to pay

compensation. The respondent No.2 contend that the accident

caused by the negligence of rider of moped hence, they are not

liable to pay compensation.      But the respondent in order to

establish their contention, not produced any evidence either oral

or documentary. Whereas the petitioner apart from his evidence

produced the documents. Hence, considering all these aspects, I

am of the opinion that respondent No.1 &amp; 2 are liable to pay
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13"> SCCH-17                           15                    MVC 1463-2014</span>


compensation to the petitioner.        Since, vehicle is insured with

respondent No.2 and the policy is in force, driver is also having
