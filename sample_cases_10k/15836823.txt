            Advocate General, Punjab, it irrefutably ensues from the testimony of

            PW-1 the complainant, who also happens to be the father of the victim

            Raunak Rawat that the accused were known to him even prior to the

            occurrence as they used to reside in the same Mohalla i.e. Sunder

            that accused Jag Narain and Triveni were on visiting terms at his house

            and which fact has not been controverted in the cross-examination of

            this witness by any means. Further in his cross-examination, the

            witness elaborates that all the accused except Ashok Kumar were on

            visiting terms with him and that there was no enmity between them and

            were even aware of his profession and as to his earnings between

            has categorically stated that these calls were being made by accused

            Triveni whom he had identified in the Court and had stated that it was

            from his PCO at phone No.24841453 that calls were made to phone

            No.249699 and these calls were made from 04.12.2005 onwards and

            further more PW-9 Sukhjinder Singh has proved the fact that from his

            PCO Nos.5562163 and 5562075 on 06.12.2005 at about 11.30 A.M.

            Nand Lal accused whom he had identified, had made telephonic call on

            No.9417478444, which is admittedly owned by the complainant and

            further more another PCO owner PW-13 Raghbir Singh has established

            that it was from his phone PCO No.5560697 on 06.12.2005 that a call

            was made and though he has been declared hostile but the call details

            proved on the record bear out and support this fact. Further PW-15

            Charanjit Singh another PCO owner has detailed that it was from his

            phone No.5563096 on evening of 06.12.2005, accused Triveni, Jag

            Narian, Nand Lal had rang up on mobile No.9417478444 and

            demanded money and has proved document Exhibit PG in this regard.

            Further more, the most important testimony is of the child who was

            after being satisfied with the ability of the child to give evidence and

            recorded his deposition and he in no certain terms stated that accused

            Jag Narian Triveni came to him and promised to take him for merry go

            his father did not give money, he will be killed and has also identified

            accused Ashok Kumar and claimed that he was also given beatings by

            the accused and it was his locket PI carrying impression 'R' which was

            got recovered on the disclosure statement of accused Jag Narain and

            being discovery on the basis of information provided by the accused, in

            police custody is certainly legitimate piece of evidence in terms of

            <a href="/doc/1312051/" id="a_15">Section 27</a> of the Evidence Act and thus cogently establishes beyond

            any doubt this story. PW-16 in his cross-examination as has been

            pointed out by learned State counsel has stated that accused Jag Narian

            used to visit his house as he was father of his friend and it was this

            accused, who has taken him from the park on his cycle though it was

            sought to be highlighted by the appellants' counsel that the witness

            states that he was taken to Bus Stand Jalandhar and there was rush and

            the child did not raise any hue and cry certainly does not impress this

            Court, as firstly the accused is known to the child and obviously the

            child must not have suspected what was in store for him and it could be

            that the child had been traumatized, which could have led to his silence

            and has given the history how he was initially taken to Amritsar and

            thereafter to Jalandhar by the accused, which is corroborated from the

            telephonic calls of the PCO at Amritsar. This witness has nailed all the

            accused to be perpetrators of this crime though PW-16 Swaran Singh

            before whom the accused had made extra judicial confession has

            sought to wriggle out of it and has been declared hostile and, however,

            only convincing but is above impeachment and clearly establishes that

            it was from the custody of all the accused, this minor child was

            recovered and that after the kidnapping of the child by these accused,

            he was kept in detention and during which period, demand of ransom

            was raised from the father of the child and it was on account of the

            conspiracy hatched by each of the accused for which as per the settled

            position of law direct evidence is rarely forthcoming and it is from the

            circumstances, the Court could adduce that the accused have put

            together their plans and in the process had carried on each act in

            furtherance of this conspiracy, until finally all the accused were nabbed

            while keeping the child in their custody, are matters which cannot

            escape judicial scrutiny of the painstaking and sincere investigations

            undertaken by the police and thus the prosecution has completely

            succeeded in establishing its case against each of the accused. The

            learned trial Court has given a well reasoned order which is duly

            supported by the evidence on record and does not call for any

            interference. Finding no merits in both the appeals, we dismiss the
