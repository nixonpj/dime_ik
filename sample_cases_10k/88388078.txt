06-11-2019.
</p>

<p id="p_2">Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner as well as the learned Addl. P.P., Assam, appearing for the
State respondent.
</p>
<p id="p_3">Raising the grievance that the learned Court of Addl. Chief Judicial Magistrate, Kamrup (M) at

Guwahati has issued the NBWA since 13.10.2015 onwards in C.R. Case No.117 C/2015, despite the fact
that no any process has been served upon him, the present petitioner u/s.482 of the <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_1">CrPC</a> has been
preferred for quashing the impugned orders dated 13.10.2015 onwards, whereby the trial Court has
issued the NBWA against him.
</p>
<p id="p_4">The learned counsel for the petitioner has drawn the attention of the Court towards the order passed
by the Court (which is annexed) and has contended that the petitioner was never served any process
of the Court and he is not a defaulter in the said case. It has been submitted that the petitioner will
face the trial regularly and for having no knowledge of the case, he could not appear before the
learned trial Court. He is however apprehensive of arrest in view of issuance of the NBWA.
</p>
<p id="p_5">On due consideration of the submission and the matters on record, the petition stands disposed of at
the motion stage itself with direction to the petitioner to appear before the trial Court on or before
03.12.2019, with proper bail application, assigning reasons for his absence with a prayer for bail and
the learned trial Court will consider and dispose of the same in accordance with law.
</p>
<p id="p_6">Till then, the execution of the standing NBWA, issued against the present petitioner is hereby stayed.
</p>



<p id="p_7">                                                                                               JUDGE
