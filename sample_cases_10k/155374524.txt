                       JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">     Aggrieved by the impugned order dated 28.03.2017

passed by the learned Single Judge in W.P.No.393 of 2016,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                 3</span>



by which the petition was disposed off, the writ petitioner

is in appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">2.    The petitioner filed writ petition under Articles 226

and 227 of the constitution of India praying to set aside

the order passed by the Karnataka State Transport

Appellate Tribunal (for short 'the KSTAT') in R.P.No.621 of

2013 dated 09.10.2015 and to remand the matter to

KSTAT for reconsideration. It is stated that the petitioner

made an application to the first respondent on 22.01.2007

for grant of fresh inter-State stage carriage permit for the

route Gowribidanur to Pavagada and back.        Joint Route

Survey was conducted and report was submitted by the

RTO, Chikkaballapur on 19.05.2007. It is stated that the

Assistant       Executive    Engineer,   PWD   Sub-division,

Pavagada,        certified    the    road   worthiness     of

Macharajanapalli to a distance of 3 kilometers.          It is

further stated that there is no overlapping over the Andhra

Pradesh scheme.         The first respondent considered the

application of the petitioner in its meeting held on
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                    4</span>



05.01.2013 and rejected the application of the petitioner

stating that there is no formation of road for a distance of

3    kilometers     from    AP-Karnataka     State        border     to

Macharajanapalli and to an extent of 0.2 kilometers

overlaps on Andhra Pradesh State Scheme. Aggrieved by

the same the petitioner filed appeal before the KSTAT in

appeal    No.621     of    2013,    contending     that    the     first

respondent without examining the Joint Route Survey

report and letter of the Assistant Executive Engineer, PWD

Sub-division, Pavagada, has rejected the application. The

Tribunal on the ground that if there is no fit route available

for movement of bus and if there is overlapping with any

notified or scheme route the rejection of application is

proper.   Aggrieved by the same the petitioner filed the

instant writ petition.
</p>
<p id="p_4">
</p><p id="p_5">3.     The learned Single Judge disposed of the writ

petition with liberty to the petitioner to file a fresh

application,   if   there    is    any   changed    circumstances
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                              5</span>



subsequent to joint route survey dated 19.05.2007.

Aggrieved by the same the petitioner is in appeal.


</p><p id="p_6">4.    Heard the learned counsel for the appellant and

learned counsels for the respondents. Perused the appeal

papers.
</p>
<p id="p_7">
</p><p id="p_8">5.    The learned counsel for the appellant would submit

that the learned Single Judge committed an error in

disposing off the writ petition.   It is contended that the

learned Single Judge failed to appreciate the road worthy

report of Assistant Executive Engineer, PWD Sub-division,

Pavagada and further failed to properly look into the

Andhra Pradesh Scheme.       It is the submission of the

learned counsel for the appellant that learned Single Judge

ought to have looked into the report of the Assistant

Executive Engineer, PWD Sub-division, Pavagada with

regard to road worthiness.    Thus, prays for allowing the

writ appeal.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                               6</span><p id="p_9">



</p><p id="p_10">6.    Per contra, learned counsels for the respondents

would support the order of the learned Single Judge and

points out that the petitioner is at liberty to make a fresh

application, if there is any changed circumstances, which

learned Single Judge has observed.
</p>
<p id="p_11">
</p><p id="p_12">7.    The petitioner made an application dated 22.01.2007

to the first respondent for grant of fresh inter-State stage

carriage permit for the route Gowribidanur to Pavagada

and back. The 1st respondent to consider the application

of the petitioner directed the RTO, Chikkaballapur to

submit joint survey of the route in question and to submit

his report. The RTO, Chikkaballapur, conducted joint route

survey and submitted his report on 19.05.2007. Based on

the joint survey report, the first respondent considered the

application of the petitioner and rejected the same. It is to

be seen that the joint route survey report submitted had

indicated that there is no motorable road from AP-

Karnataka State border to Macharajanapalli for about 3

kilometers and there is small overlapping with Andhra
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                 7</span>



Pradesh scheme. The Assistant Executive Engineer, PWD

Sub-division, Pavagada, in his letter dated 18.08.2007

submitted    road    worthy   certificate.      When     the   road

worthiness is not found to be good in the joint route

survey report, it is not appropriate to look into the letter

issued by the Assistant Executive Engineer, PWD Sub-

division, Pavagada with regard to road worthiness.             The

first   respondent-Karnataka        State    Transport   Authority

considering factual position and based on the route survey

report submitted by the RTO, Chikkaballapur, has rightly

rejected the application of the petitioner for grant of fresh

inter-State stage carriage permit.           The learned Single

Judge has observed that the Tribunal on analyzing the

material on record has rightly rejected the appeal filed by

the petitioner.     The petitioner has produced Annexure-B

dated 18.08.2007, the letter issued by the Assistant

Executive Engineer, PWD Sub-division, Pavagada.                 On

going through the same, it would not indicate as to who

sought information regarding road worthiness and for what
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                        8</span>



purpose    the    same      is        addressed     to   the   Transport

Commissioner,      Bengaluru.           In   the    absence     of    any

particulars, the said letter dated 18.08.2007 would be of

no assistance to the petitioner. The learned Single Judge

has   rightly    disposed        of    the   writ   petition   with   an

observation that if there is any changed circumstances

subsequent to joint route survey dated 19.05.2007, it is

open to the petitioner to approach the Authorities by filing

fresh application. We see no perversity or erroneousness

in the order passed by the learned Single Judge. No

ground is made out to interfere with the order passed by

the learned Single Judge. Accordingly, the writ appeal is

dismissed.
