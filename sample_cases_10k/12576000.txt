           started   rendering   services   to   the   defendant   company   to   generate 

           healthy business bonds between the parties. The plaintiff agreed to pay

           bill/ invoice raised by the plaintiff against the defendants in due course 

           of   business   for   the   services   rendered   by   the   plaintiff.   Despite   the

</p><p id="p_16">           9.                      The plaintiff by way of its evidence has proved the  original 

           Airway Bills and has also proved the statement of account which shows 

           the outstanding amount of Rs. 1,03,794/­ against the defendants. The 

           letter   Ex.   PW1/19   proves   that   the   defendants   have   admitted   their 

           liability to pay an amount of Rs. 1,03,740/­ to the plaintiff company and 

           has even paid an amount of Rs. 25,935/­ to the plaintiff in discharge of

           gone unchallenged and un­rebutted and the same is substantiated by 

           the   documents   placed   and   proved   on   record.  There   is   no   reason   to 

           disbelieve the evidence led by the plaintiff and an adverse inference can 

           be drawn against the defendants. The suit of the plaintiff is within the 

           limitation period and thus, on the basis of bills, statement of account 

           Ex.   PW1/14   &amp;   the   letter   Ex.   PW1/19,   the   plaintiff   is   entitled   for   the 

           recovery of remaining principal amount along with the interest.
