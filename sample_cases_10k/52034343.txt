</pre><p id="p_1">      1.                 The   facts   in   brief   of   the   present   case   as   per 

             prosecution version are that on 29.6.2007, the complainant i.e. 

333/2007­ Adarsh Nagar                                                              page1/
              HC Savender Singh was on patrolling duty alongwith Ct. Ashok 

             Kumar in the area.   It is alleged that at about 7.30 PM when 

             they reached at Sushila Road, Adarsh Nagar a secret informer 

             informed   that   a   person   is   standing   with   intention   to  commit 

             some crime at 80foota Road, Adarsh Nagar with illegal knife 

             and   said   person   could   be   apprehended   if   raid   is   conducted 

             immediately.  It is further alleged that complainant requested 4­

             5 passersby to join the raiding party but none agreed and left 

             expressing   their   inability   and   then   a   raiding   party   was 

             constituted by.  It is further alleged that thereafter they reached 

             the spot and apprehended the accused at the instance of secret 

             informer   and   on   conducting   formal   search   of   accused   one 

             buttondar   knife   was   recovered   from   right   side   pocket   of   his 

             pant.   It is further alleged that the knife was measured and its 

             sketch was prepared and pulanda was prepared after sealing it 

             with seal of SS and took the same into possession.   ON the 

             basis   of   the   said   allegations   case   was   got   registered   against 

             accused and investigation was carried out.

             framed   against   accused   to   which   he   pleaded   not   guilty   and

             wherein accused denied the evidence that has come on record 

             against him. However, accused choose not to lead evidence in 

             his defence.

             Ex. PW1/A.
</p>
<p id="p_9">      9.                 PW2 HC Jai Bhagwan is the second IO.  He deposed 

             regarding receipt of copy of FIR;  reaching the spot alongwith 

             PW4;  preparing site plan and arrest of accused etc.

</p><p id="p_10">      10.                PW3 HC Savender is the complainant/ first IO. He 

             deposed  regarding patrolling duty alongwith PW4; receipt of 

             secret   information;     apprehension   of   accused;   recovery   of 

             buttondar knife from the possession of accused;   getting case 

             registered through PW4;  arrival of second IO at the spot etc.

</p><p id="p_11">      11.                PW4 is HC Ashok Kumar.  The testimony of PW4 is 

             similar to that of PW3 as he was alongwith the IO at the time of 

             apprehension of accused and recovery of knife from possession 

             of accused.
</p>
<p id="p_12">      12.                Accused   in   his   statement   recorded   u/s.   281/   313 

             cr.p.c. denied the evidence that has come on record against him. 

             Accused choose not to lead evidence in his defence.

</p><p id="p_13">      13.                In   the   present   case,   prosecution  has   produced   and 

333/2007­ Adarsh Nagar                                                              page4/
              examined four witnesses.   The testimony of PW1 is of formal 

             nature being the duty officer.  The testimony of PW2, PW3 and 

             PW4 is material one. 
</p>
<p id="p_14">      14.                 As per prosecution story, the complainant i.e. PW3 

             was   on   patrolling   duty   alongwith   PW4   when   accused   was 

             apprehended at the instance of secret informer and a knife was 

             allegedly recovered from the possession of accused. 

</p><p id="p_15">      15.                 Perusal of testimony of PW3 and PW4 shows that 

             the sketch of knife is Ex. PW3/A and the seizure memo is Ex. 

             PW3/B.  PW3 and PW4 have stated in their testimony recorded 

             in court that the aforesaid two documents were prepared by IO 

             prior to the registration of the present case. However, perusal of 

             abovesaid documents i.e. Ex. PW3/A and Ex. PW3/B clearly 

             shows that the FIR Number and other particulars of the present 

             case are mentioned on the said documents.  No explanation has 

             come from the prosecution as to how the FIR Number surfaced 

             on   those   documents   which   were   prepared   prior   to   the 

             registration   of   the   case.     This   fact   casts   a   doubt   upon   the 

             testimony of PW3 and PW4 because if the said documents were 

333/2007­ Adarsh Nagar                                                                   page5/
              prepared prior to the registration of the present case, then how 

             the FIR Number as well as other particulars of the present case 

             surfaced   on   the  said  documents.  At  this  stage,  reference  can 

             also be made of a case titled as <a href="/doc/382540/" id="a_5">Pawan Kumar vs. Delhi Admn</a>.  

             1987 CC Cases­585 Delhi wherein Hon'ble High Court of Delhi 

             had held that the mention of FIR Number on recovery memo 

             etc. which were prepared prior to lodging the FIR creates doubt 

             and benefit should go to the accused. 
</p>
<p id="p_16">      16.                 As   per   prosecution   story,   the   knife   was   recovered 

             from   the   possession   of   accused   from   public   place.     It   is 

             pertinent to mention that the place from where the accused was 

             allegedly apprehended is a busy place and lot of shops/ houses 

             are located in the vicinity. PW3 and PW4 have deposed in their 

             examination in chief that 4­5 passersby to join the investigation 

             but none agreed.  However, inspite of it IO had failed to join any 

             public witness in the investigation of present case.   No efforts 

             were made by the IO to call witnesses from the nearby shops/ 

             houses.   At  this stage, reference can also be made to a case 

             titled   as  <a href="/doc/924354/" id="a_6">Nanak   Chand   vs.   State   of   Delhi</a>   reported   as   1992  

333/2007­ Adarsh Nagar                                                                page6/
              Cr.L.J­ 55  wherein it was held that the recovery was from a 

             street with houses on both sides and shops nearby.  And, yet no 

             witness from the public has been produced.   Not that in every 

             case   the   police   officials   are   to   be   treated   as   unworthy   of 

             reliance   but   their   failure   to   join   witnesses   from   the   public 

             especially   when   they   are   available   at   their   elbow,   may   cast 

             doubt.   
</p>
<p id="p_17">      17.                 It is also pertinent to mention that as per prosecution 

             version the seal after use was handed over by PW3 to PW4. 

             Both PW3 and PW4 are police officials and were posted in the 

             same police station on the relevant date and time.  Seal was not 

             handed over to any independent witness.  In such a situation the 

             possibility of tampering with the case property cannot be ruled 

             out. 
</p>
<p id="p_18">      18.                 It is also pertinent to mention that as per prosecution 

             version PW3 alongwith PW4 were on patrolling duty in the area 

             but   the   prosecution   has   failed   to   produce   documentary 

             evidence/DD in this regard.  This fact also creates a doubt in the 

             prosecution version.

</p><p id="p_20">       19.                Thus,   in   view   of   the   facts   and   circumstances   and 

             discussion made hereinabove, I am of the considered view that 

             prosecution has failed to prove its case against accused beyond
