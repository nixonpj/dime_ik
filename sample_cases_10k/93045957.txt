      IN THE HIGH COURT OF JUDICATURE AT BOMBAY

                           BENCH AT AURANGABAD

PER COURT :
</p>
<p id="p_2">
1]       A very short point arises for consideration in the writ petition.



2]       We have heard learned counsel for the parties.



3]       A proclamation was issued on 25.03.2008 inviting applications to fill

up one vacant post of Police Patil in village Kedarkheda, Tq. Bhokardan,

                                                                       WP 1148/2010

</p>
<p id="p_4">Dist. Jalna.          Three applicants were empaneled. The petitioner, the

respondent No. 3 and one Mr. Lachuriya. Respondent No. 3 obtained 58

marks, the petitioner and Mr. Lachuriya obtained 50 marks.                               But

Mr. Lachuriya got knocked out of the race because he had not cleared the

secondary examination. Residence in the village was an essential condition

of eligibility.
</p>
<p id="p_5">

4]       Thus, only petitioner and respondent no. 3 remained in the race.



5]       So acute is the race for jobs in India that petitioner went upon

hunting the personal information regarding respondent No. 3. Petitioner

found that name of respondent No. 3 was entered in the voters' list

published on 10.06.2007 recording him to be a resident of village Walsa-

Khalsa. Armed with the said document and alleging the same to be the

proof of respondent No. 3's residence, Original Application No. 616/2008

was filed by the petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_6">

6]       The response was that respondent No. 3 was residing in village

Kedarkheda and in support thereof, respondent No. 3 produced voters' list




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">     ::: Uploaded on - 25/09/2019                  ::: Downloaded on - 26/09/2019 02:24:18 :::</span>

</p><p id="p_7">                                         -   3 -
</p>
<p id="p_8">showing his name entered in the voters' list recording his residence as

village Kedarkheda as well.         Respondent No. 3 also filed documents

showing ownership of immovable property in village Kedarkheda.

Authenticity of the said document was not challenged by the petitioner.



7]       The Tribunal has reasoned that merely on fact that respondent No.

3's name was entered in the voters' list in two villages was not sufficient to

draw an inference that respondent No. 3 was a resident of village Walsa-

Khalsa. The Tribunal held that therefrom it could not even be inferred

that he was a resident of village Kedarkheda. But broke the deadlock with

respect to respondent No. 3 proving that he owned agricultural land and

residential house in village Kedarkheda.



8]       The issue in the writ petition is whether the Tribunal drew right

inference and reasoned logically with reference to the documentary

material before it.

<p id="p_9">

9]       We hold that the Tribunal reasoned logically. If a person's name is

recorded at two places in a voters' list with difference residences, the two

instant case, the proof has been seen with reference to the title document of

the immovable property.

<p id="p_12">

9]        We agree with the decision of the Tribunal.               The petition is

dismissed.
