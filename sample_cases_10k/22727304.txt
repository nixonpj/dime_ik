<p id="p_1">1.            The appellant-revenue has preferred the present appeal under

<a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_1">Section 260A</a> of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (in short, "the Act") against the

order dated 15.9.2006 passed by the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal Delhi

Bench      'C',   New     Delhi   (in   short,    "the   Tribunal")   in   IT(SS)

A.No.193/DEL/2001 for the block assessment period 1988-89 to 1997-98.

On October 11, 2007, the appeal was admitted to consider following

substantial questions of law:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">              "i) Whether under the given facts and circumstances, the
              learned members of the ITAT have erred in law in deleting the
              addition of ` 45,70,000/- made by the A.O. on account of peak
              of deposits in the bank account?

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">             ii) Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case,

             <a href="/doc/72121/" id="a_2">Section 2(22)(e)</a> of the Income Tax Act, 1961, and also in
             deleting the addition of ` 45,70,000/- without appreciating the

             evidence that the amount in question was advanced by it to the
             lender Shri Jagdish Lal against purchase of wheat?"
</blockquote>

<p id="p_2">2.           A few facts relevant for the decision of the controversy

involved as available on the record may be noticed. The respondent-assessee

company is engaged in the manufacture of wheat products like suji, maida,

flour and bran etc. A new factory was also started at Ahmedabad. During the

course of search proceedings in the factory premises of the assessee at Hisar

and registered office of the assessee at Hisar, several valuable articles were

found. The assessee was asked to explain the source of the acquisition of the

same alongwith the necessary evidence. Assessment was completed under

<a href="/doc/1418518/" id="a_3">sections 158BC</a>/<a href="/doc/1187642/" id="a_4">144</a> of the Act on 12.1.2000 at an income of

` 7,89,55,400/-. The Assessing Officer after investigation vide order dated

12.1.2000 made addition to the income of the assessee at ` 2,00,000/-on this

account as the company had not explained the source of investment in these

articles. Aggrieved by the order, the assessee filed appeal before the

Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) [CIT(A)]. Vide order dated

2.3.2001, the CIT(A) deleted the addition holding that these household

goods belonged to the directors and not the assessee company. The

department filed appeal before the Tribunal against the order dated 2.3.2001

passed by the CIT(A). Vide order dated 15.9.2006, the Tribunal deleted the

addition with the observation that there being no mistake in the order of the

CIT(A) and dismissed the revenue's appeal on this point. Hence the instant

appeal by the appellant-revenue.
</p>
<p id="p_3">3.           We have heard learned counsel for the appellant-revenue.

</p><p id="p_4">4.           A perusal of the assessment order passed by the Assessing

Officer shows that vide questionnaire dated 5.1.1999, the assessee was

intimated that blank cheque book of the proprietary concern of M/s Jagdish

Lal Karan Singh, Prop. Jagdish Lal was found from the factory premises of

the assessee company at Hisar. The directors of the assessee company had

raised loans from Shri Jagdish Lal. On enquiry from Shri Jagdish Lal, it was

found that he was not a man of means. He was residing in a rented house.

His income was below taxable limit. His statement was recorded under

<a href="/doc/727816/" id="a_5">section 131</a> of the Act. He deposed that he was not assessed to income tax.

He further stated that current account No.6337 in Punjab National Bank was

opened by him on behalf of Shri P.R.Gupta and he had not deposited any

money of his own in this account. When he was asked to give the source of

various advances given by him through cheques, he replied that he suffered

heavy losses and had not given any loan or advances to any person. After

considering the entire evidence on record, it has been categorically recorded

by the Assessing officer that the assessee company had not filed any

evidence that the amounts in questions were advanced for purchase of

wheat. Further, no evidence had been filed that the wheat was not available

and the amounts in question were taken as loans by the directors. No

evidence was led as to how the loans taken by the directors from the

accounts of M/s Jagdish Lal Karan Singh were utilized. Further Shri Jagdish

Lal, proprietor of M/s Jagdish Lal was not produced by the assessee. Thus,

the amount was treated as undisclosed income of the assessee company for

             9.3. I have considered the facts of the case and contention of the

             purchase of wheat. Further, no evidence has been filed that the
             wheat was not available and the amounts in question were taken

             the loans taken by the directors from the accounts of M/s
             Jagdish Lal Karan Singh were utilized. In these circumstances,
             the contention of the assessee company cannot be accepted. The

             been produced. In these circumstances, adverse view is to be
             taken. As already stated enquiries made by the ADIT has
             revealed that Shri Jagdish Lal is not a man of means. He is
             running a very small business in a rented shop. Thus peak of
             deposits in this account which has been appropriated by the
             directors of the assessee company has to be treated as concealed
             income of the assessee company. The peak of deposits in this
             account works out to ` 455,70 lacs. The peak deposit of
             ` 45,70,000/- is treated as undisclosed income of the assessee
             company of the block period falling in the block assessment.
             Action has already been taken by ITO, Ward 4 Hisar in the case
             of M/s Jagdish Lal Karan Singh Prop. Shri Jagdish Lal of Ratia.

order dated 2.3.2001, the CIT(A) deleted the addition without giving any

reason as would be evident from the following observations recorded by the

CIT(A) which read thus:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_9">             "9. Regarding addition of ` 45.70 lacs made on account of

             amount returned to the directors. It is in the nature of direct

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12"> ITA No.343 of 2007                                                            7</span>


               of advances is not proved. The assessee company has given
               amount to the bank account from its disclosed account and
               therefore, the source is proved and no case of addition is made
               out by the department. The CIT(A) has given a finding that the
               cheques had been issued to M/s Jagdish Lal Karan Singh by the
               assessee company and the amount was returned to the directors.
               It is in the nature of direct amount deposited in the accounts of
               the directors, which can be taken as deemed dividend in their
               hands under <a href="/doc/72121/" id="a_8">section 2(22)(e)</a> of the Act. There being no mistake
               in the order of the CIT(A) on this issue, the same is confirmed
               and the ground of appeal No.3 of the revenue is dismissed."
</blockquote><p id="p_7">7.             On a perusal of the findings recorded by the authorities, we find

that sufficient reasons have been given by the Assessing Officer for the

addition to the income of the assessee. The finding has been recorded after

considering the evidence and the material on record. The CIT(A) has

reversed the said finding without giving any cogent and convincing reasons.

The Tribunal has upheld the said finding as it is.
</p>
<p id="p_8">8.             In view of the above, it would be appropriate that the orders

dated 2.3.2001 and 15.9.2006 passed by the CIT(A) and the Tribunal

respectively are set aside and the matter is remanded to the CIT(A) for

considering it afresh after hearing learned counsel for the parties in

accordance with law. Ordered accordingly. Consequently, the appeal stands

disposed of.</p><pre id="pre_3">
