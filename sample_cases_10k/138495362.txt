</p><p id="p_3">                                  The prayer of petitioner for anticipatory bail was
                 earlier rejected by this court vide order dated 28.10.2016 passed in
                 Cr. Misc. No. 39698 of 2016.
</p><p id="p_4">                                  The learned counsel for the petitioner submits that
                 petitioner again filed this petition for grant of anticipatory bail on
                 the ground that during the course of trial of Sessions Trial No. 39
                 of 2017 one prosecution witness was examined but he did not
                 support the prosecution case. It is further submitted that husband
                 of the deceased filed Matrimonial case No. 272 of 2013 for
                 restitution of conjugal rights and the learned Principal Judge,
                 Family Court, Muzaffarpur decreed the suit. The wife/ deceased
                 went to the house of her in-laws but she committed suicide by
                 consuming poison. It is further submitted that one Dr. Raja Imam

                     Kazmi treated the deceased and found that the deceased had taken
                     poison eight months ago. The deceased had tendency of
                     committing suicide. The petitioner is mother-in-law of the
                     deceased but from perusal of the records, it appears that the
                     deceased was married to Md. Nazir in the year 2010 but
                     immediately after marriage her husband, father-in-law, and
                     mother-in-law, the petitioner, started subjecting the deceased to
                     different sorts of torture. The deceased filed complaint case in
                     Civil Court, Vaishali. The accused persons compromised the
                     criminal case and took the deceased to their house but only ten
                     days thereafter the deceased was killed and her dead body was
                     disposed of. The prayer of petitioner for anticipatory bail was
                     rejected on 28.10.2016 but even then the petitioner has not
                     surrendered in the court for more than one year and filed this
                     petition for grant of anticipatory bail.
</p><p id="p_5">                                        I do not find any new ground to reconsider the
                     prayer of petitioner for anticipatory bail and the same is once
                     again rejected.
