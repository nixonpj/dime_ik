</pre>
<p id="p_1">I.A. No. 12845/2019 (Exemption)
       Exemption allowed subject to all just exceptions.
       Application stands disposed of.
</p>
<p id="p_2">ARB.P. 592/2019

</p><p id="p_3">1.     This is a petition under <a href="/doc/596725/" id="a_1">Section 11</a> of the Arbitration &amp; <a href="/doc/1306164/" id="a_2">Conciliation
       Act</a>, 1996 ('Act') for appointment of a second Arbitrator to adjudicate
       the disputes between the parties.
</p>
<p id="p_4">2.     The Arbitration Clause between the parties reads as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">                  "29.0 Arbitration: (in Contract No.PM/EC/002)

                  29.1 In case of any dispute or differences arising between
                  the parties in respect of any matter of the contract, the
                  matter shall be settled mutually. If theÂ· settlement is not
                  reached, the matter will be referred to Arbitration. The
                  Arbitrator will be appointed one each by the parties

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">ARB.P. 592/2019                                                          Page 1 of 3</span>
                   concerned and these arbitrators shall appoint an umpire.
                  The decision of the arbitrators and/ or umpire shall be
                  final and binding on the parties. Further, the arbitration
                  proceedings shall be as per the <a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_3">Arbitration Act</a> 1940 and
                  its amendments made from time to time.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">                  29.3 The venue of the Arbitration proceedings shall be
                  New Delhi''

</blockquote><p id="p_5">3.     In accordance with the said Arbitration Clause, the petitioner and the
       respondent had nominated their Arbitrator. The two Arbitrators could
       not reach a consensus on the appointment of the Presiding Arbitrator
       and had approached this Court.
</p><p id="p_6">4.     Vide order dated 21.01.1999 this Court had appointed a third
       Arbitrator.       After the said nomination, however, the Arbitrator
       nominated by the respondent, resigned as an Arbitrator.
</p><p id="p_7">5.     Since the respondent had failed to nominate its Arbitrator, the
       petitioner approached this Court to appoint an Arbitrator on behalf of
       the respondent, by filing a petition under <a href="/doc/596725/" id="a_4">Section 11</a> of the Act.
</p><p id="p_8">6.     On 09.10.2007, this Court had appointed Mr. Justice J.K. Mehra, a
       former Judge of this Court as the second Arbitrator on behalf of the
       respondent.        Due to the sudden death of the Arbitrator of the
       petitioner, Mr. Justice S.S. Chaddha (Retd.), another former Judge of
       this Court was appointed as a co-Arbitrator.               Thereafter, the
       proceedings continued and the matter was to be taken up for final
       arguments.
</p><p id="p_9">7.     In the proceedings held on 16.05.2019, the matter was adjourned to
       02.08.2019 for hearing. Vide email dated 30th June 2019, family of
       Mr. Justice J.K. Mehra (Retd.) informed about his sudden demise.

<p id="p_10">        Learned Counsel for the petitioner contends that ever since the
       respondent has not nominated its Arbitrator and hence the present
       petition has been filed.
</p><p id="p_11">8.     Mr. Naveen Sharma, Advocate enters appearance on behalf of the
       respondent.
</p><p id="p_12">9.     The parties have consented to the appointment of Mr. Justice K.K.
</p><p id="p_13">       Lahoti, Former Judge of the Madhya Pradesh High Court to be
       appointed as an Arbitrator for and on behalf of the respondent.
</p><p id="p_14">10.    With the consent of the parties, I hereby appoint Hon'ble Mr. Justice
       K.K. Lahoti, Former Judge of the Madhya Pradesh High Court as a
       co-Arbitrator to adjudicate the disputes between the parties. The
       learned Arbitrator will give a disclosure under <a href="/doc/1265271/" id="a_5">Section 12</a> of the Act
       before proceeding with the matter.
</p><p id="p_15">11.    Needless to say that the proceedings will resume from the stage, they
       are pending.
</p><p id="p_16">12.    The petition is disposed of in the aforesaid terms.
