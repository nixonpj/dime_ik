Mr.Dinesh Yadav, Addl.Adv.General for appellant-State.
Mr.Ankush Sharma on behalf of
Mr.J.M.Saxena, for respondent No.1.
*****
</pre><p id="p_1">	We have heard counsel for the parties on the application u/S.5 of the Limitation Act.
</p><p id="p_2">	We are satisfied that the delay has been satisfactorily explained.
</p><p id="p_3">	Accordingly, the application u/S.5 of the Limitation Act stands allowed and the delay is accordingly condoned.
</p><p id="p_4">	We have noticed from the record that respondent-employee joined service on 21.04.1971 as Lower Division Clerk and retired from service and certain financial benefits, which were granted to him by the ld.Tribunal are subject matter of challenge in writ proceedings.
</p><p id="p_5">	At one stage, we considered it appropriate that if the parties give their consent, the matter may be disposed of finally by this court itself on merits.
</p><p id="p_6">	Counsel for respondent submits that he has instructions only in respect of the order which is under challenge and he has shown his reluctance in giving consent for disposal of dispute finally from this court.
</p><p id="p_7">	We have heard the parties on the limited issue, arises in the instant intra-court appeal.
</p><p id="p_8">	The writ petition came to be filed by the State of Rajasthan against the order of ld.Tribunal dt.12.10.2006, arises out of the Appeal No.2675/1999 &amp; because of non-compliance of per-emptory order the writ petition was dismissed for non-prosecution against which an application for restoration was filed giving justification but that was not considered to be appropriate and restoration application was also dismissed by the ld.Single Judge of this court.
</p><p id="p_9">	The appellant has placed on record reasonable justification for which per-emptory order of this court could not be complied with and in these facts &amp; circumstances, the order of ld.Single Judge dismissing the writ petition for non-prosecution and the order dismissing the restoration applications are not sustainable and the same are accordingly set aside and the matter is remitted back to the ld.Single Judge to hear the parties afresh.
</p><p id="p_10">	Consequently, the instant intra-court appeal succeeds and the orders of ld.Single Judge dt.10.05.2007, 20.05.2009 &amp; 06.01.2012 are set aside and the writ petition is restored to its original number and be listed before the ld.Single Judge. Let the parties may appear in the proceedings before the ld.Single Judge.
