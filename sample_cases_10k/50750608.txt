          (Narendra Singh Vs. State of M.P.)

15.02.2017
     Shri R.K.Sharma, counsel for the applicant.
     Mohd. Irshad, Panel Lawyer for the respondent</pre>
<p id="p_1">No.1/State.
</p><p id="p_2">     None for the respondent No.2 though served.
     This petition under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_1">Section 482</a> of Cr.P.C. has been
filed for quashing the FIR registered by Police Station
Chinor,   District   Gwalior   in   Crime   No.27/2012     under
<a href="/doc/1667388/" id="a_2">Sections 419</a>, <a href="/doc/1436241/" id="a_3">420</a>, <a href="/doc/1985627/" id="a_4">467</a>, <a href="/doc/556166/" id="a_5">468</a>, <a href="/doc/1466184/" id="a_6">471</a>, <a href="/doc/1897847/" id="a_7">120B</a> and <a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_8">34</a> of IPC.
</p><p id="p_3">     Before considering the facts of the case, it would be
essential to take note of certain developments which had
taken place during the pendency of this petition. By reply
dated 04.11.2016, it was mentioned by the respondent
No.1/State that as there was an interim order passed by
this Court on 01.08.2012 directing that no coercive steps,
like arrest, shall be taken against the applicant therefore,
the charge-sheet has not been filed against the applicant,
although, the charge-sheet has been filed against the
remaining accused persons. Another reply was filed on
28.11.2016, in which it was mentioned that the applicant is
absconding and, therefore, the proceedings under <a href="/doc/1598801/" id="a_9">Section
82</a> of Cr.P.C. have been initiated and the JMFC has issued
arrest warrant against the applicant and the applicant is
still not traceable. In view of this reply filed by the State,
this Court by order dated 16.12.2016 directed the applicant
to appear before the Investigating Officer on 21.12.2016
and on all dates fixed thereafter, before the Investigating
Officer and shall cooperate with him in the investigation.
The applicant has filed certain documents thereafter, to
                                                   M.Cr.C. No.5819/2012
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                     2</span>

show that in compliance of the order dated 16.12.2016
passed   by     this   Court   he        has   appeared   before    the
Investigating     Officer      and       is    cooperating    in    the
investigation. The State counsel has not denied this fact
that the applicant has appeared before Investigating Officer
and is cooperating with the investigation.
</p><p id="p_4">     Under these circumstances, this Court is of the
considered opinion that since, the applicant is appearing
before the Investigating Officer therefore, now at this
stage, it cannot be said that he is absconding.
</p><p id="p_5">     Accordingly, the petition is heard on merits.
     The facts necessary for the disposal of the present
application in short are that the complainant Chhotelal
lodged a report in Police Station Chinor, District Gwalior,
alleging that he is the owner of certain land situated in
Village Bhori and co-accused Ramvilas Goswami prepared a
forged power of attorney in his name allegedly executed by
Chhotelal in his favor and, thereafter, on the basis of the
said forged power of attorney the co-accused executed the
sale-deed in favor of son of Ramvilas Goswami by affixing
the photographs of the complainant. On the basis of
written report of the complainant Chhotelal, the police
registered the FIR in Crime No.27/2012 for offence
punishable under <a href="/doc/1667388/" id="a_10">Sections 419</a>, <a href="/doc/1436241/" id="a_11">420</a>, <a href="/doc/1985627/" id="a_12">467</a>, <a href="/doc/556166/" id="a_13">468</a>, <a href="/doc/1466184/" id="a_14">471</a>, <a href="/doc/1897847/" id="a_15">120B</a>
and <a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_16">34</a> of IPC. It was the contention of the complainant
that on 08.07.2011, the co-accused Ramvilas Goswami got
a forged power of attorney in his favor allegedly executed
by the complainant. It was alleged that the co-accused
Vijay Singh had impersonated as complainant. Hari Om
Sharma and Rampuri had signed the forged power of
                                          M.Cr.C. No.5819/2012
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                              3</span>

attorney as witnesses. On the basis of this power of
attorney, on 23.11.2011 by affixing the photographs of the
complainant, the co-accused Ramvilas Goswami executed
the sale-deed in favor of Vijay Singh and his son Rampuri.
Hari Om Sharma and Rajendra Sharma had signed the
sale-deed as witnesses. It was alleged in the written report
that the applicant had drafted the forged power of attorney
as well as the sale-deed therefore, he had also helped the
co-accused persons in playing fraud.
</p><p id="p_6">      It is contended by the counsel for the applicant that
the applicant is an Advocate by profession and is practicing
in Dabra District, Gwalior. It is his professional duty to
draft the documents as required by his clients. It is further
submitted that unless and until there is some element of
conspiracy between the applicant and the co-accused
persons, then merely in discharge of his professional duty,
if the applicant had drafted certain documents then, that
by itself would not be sufficient to hold that the applicant
has   also   committed   an   offence   as   alleged   by   the
complainant. It is further submitted that the applicant in
the capacity of an Advocate earns his livelihood by drafting
the documents and by representing the clients before the
Courts, and also by arguing on their behalf. Therefore, it
cannot be said that by drafting this power of attorney or
sale-deed which according to the complainant is a forged
document the applicant in any manner, has committed any
offence.
</p><p id="p_7">      Per contra, the counsel for the applicant submitted
that although there is no other evidence on record to show
that the applicant except by drafting the power of attorney
                                                    M.Cr.C. No.5819/2012
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                  4</span>

and the sale-deed has done anything else but, it is a
matter of evidence that whether the applicant was a part of
the conspiracy or not. Accordingly, it was submitted that
the FIR at this stage, may not be quashed.
</p><p id="p_8">     Heard the learned counsel for the parties.
     Undisputedly,    the    applicant        is    an   advocate     by
profession and he is practicing as a lawyer in District Court
Dabra, District Gwalior. An Advocate earns his livelihood by
drafting documents, by representing their clients before the
Court and, therefore, it is their professional duty to draft
documents on the instructions of the clients or to represent
them in the Court of law. Thus, merely because a
document has been drafted by an advocate, that by itself
would not be sufficient to prima facie hold that if, such
document is subsequently found to be a forged document,
then the advocate was also a part of the conspiracy. In
such a situation, there should be something more to show
that the advocate knew this fact that the person who has
given instructions infact is impersonating himself as other
person.
</p><p id="p_9">     During the investigation the police had recorded the
statement of one S.B.Singh Sub-Registrar, Dabra. He in his
statement has stated that on 08.07.2011 a document was
produced by so called Chhotelal@Chota for execution of
power of attorney and the said person had projected
himself   as   Chhotelal    and       after   comparing      with    the
photographs affixed on the said power of attorney and in
the presence of the witnesses Hari Om Sharma and
Rampuri who had produced their ration card by way of
their identity proof, the power of attorney was registered.
</p><p id="p_10">                                         M.Cr.C. No.5819/2012
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                             5</span>

It was further stated by him that in fact Ram Vilas
Goswami has prepared a forged power of attorney. Thus,
from the statement of this witness, it is clear that the
applicant had not appeared before the Sub-Registrar,
Dabra, District Gwalior for the purposes of execution of the
said power of attorney.
</p><p id="p_11">     Ramlal Ahirwar, Sub-Registrar, has stated that on the
basis of the power of attorney executed on 08.07.2011, he
had registered the sale-deed in favor of Rampuri and Vijay
Singh in the presence of two persons namely Hari Om
Sharma and Rajendra. The holder of power of attorney had
stated that he knows all the persons who are present
before the Sub-Registrar and the identity proof and the
affidavits were also given by them. This witness has also
not stated that at the time of execution of the sale-deed,
the applicant was present before him.
</p><p id="p_12">     On going through the power of attorney which was
executed on 08.07.2011, it is seen that at the bottom of
the said document, it is mentioned that "drafted by
N.S.Baghel, Advocate, District-Dabra." Except this no other
action was taken by the present applicant. Similarly, on
going through the sale-deed dated 23.12.2011 it is found
that at the bottom of the sale-deed it is mentioned that
"drafted by me N.S.Baghel, Advocate, District-Dabra." In
this document also nothing else was done by the present
applicant. In both the documents neither he identified the
executant of the sale-deed nor witnesses. Under these
circumstances, this Court is of the view that merely, by
drafting the power of attorney dated 08.07.2011 and sale-
deed dated 23.12.2011, it cannot be said that the applicant
                                        M.Cr.C. No.5819/2012
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                            6</span>

<p id="p_14">     The Supreme Court in the case of Amit Kapoor Vs.
Ramesh Chander       reported in (2012) 9 SCC 460 has
held as under :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_8">     "27. Having discussed the scope of jurisdiction
     under these two provisions i.e. Section 397
     and Section 482 of the Code and the fine line
     of jurisdictional distinction, now it will be
     appropriate for us to enlist the principles with
     reference to which the courts should exercise
     such jurisdiction. However, it is not only
                                    M.Cr.C. No.5819/2012
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                        8</span>

difficult but is inherently impossible to state
with precision such principles. At best and
upon objective analysis of various judgments
of this Court, we are able to cull out some of
the principles to be considered for proper
exercise of jurisdiction, particularly, with
regard to quashing of charge either in exercise
of jurisdiction under Section 397 or Section
482 of the Code or together, as the case may
be:
</blockquote>
<p id="p_15">27.1. Though there are no limits of the powers
of the Court under <a href="/doc/903398/" id="a_25">Section 482</a> of the Code
but the more the power, the more due care
and caution is to be exercised in invoking
these powers. The power of quashing criminal
proceedings, particularly, the charge framed in
terms of <a href="/doc/1969991/" id="a_26">Section 228</a> of the Code should be
exercised    very     sparingly     and    with
circumspection and that too in the rarest of
rare cases.
</p>
<p id="p_16">27.2. The Court should apply the test as to
whether the uncontroverted allegations as
made from the record of the case and the
documents submitted therewith prima facie
establish the offence or not. If the allegations
are so patently absurd and inherently
improbable that no prudent person can ever
reach such a conclusion and where the basic
ingredients of a criminal offence are not
satisfied then the Court may interfere.
</p>
<p id="p_17">27.3. The High Court should not unduly
interfere. No meticulous examination of the
evidence is needed for considering whether
the case would end in conviction or not at the
stage of framing of charge or quashing of
charge.
</p>
<p id="p_18">27.4. Where the exercise of such power is
absolutely   essential   to   prevent    patent
miscarriage of justice and for correcting some
grave error that might be committed by the
subordinate courts even in such cases, the
                                    M.Cr.C. No.5819/2012
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                        9</span>

High Court should be loath to interfere, at the
threshold, to throttle the prosecution in
exercise of its inherent powers.
</p>
<p id="p_19">27.5. Where there is an express legal bar
enacted in any of the provisions<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_27"> of the Code</a> or
any specific law in force to the very initiation
or institution and continuance of such criminal
proceedings, such a bar is intended to provide
specific protection to an accused.
</p>
<p id="p_20">27.6. The Court has a duty to balance the
freedom of a person and the right of the
complainant or prosecution to investigate and
prosecute the offender.
</p>
<p id="p_21">27.7. The process of the court cannot be
permitted to be used for an oblique or
ultimate/ulterior purpose.
</p>
<p id="p_22">27.8. Where the allegations made and as they
appeared from the record and documents
annexed therewith to predominantly give rise
and constitute a "civil wrong" with no "element
of criminality" and does not satisfy the basic
ingredients of a criminal offence, the court
may be justified in quashing the charge. Even
in such cases, the court would not embark
upon the critical analysis of the evidence.
</p>
<p id="p_23">27.9. Another very significant caution that the
courts have to observe is that it cannot
examine the facts, evidence and materials on
record to determine whether there is sufficient
material on the basis of which the case would
end in a conviction; the court is concerned
primarily with the allegations taken as a whole
whether they will constitute an offence and, if
so, is it an abuse of the process of court
leading to injustice.
</p>
<p id="p_24">27.10. It is neither necessary nor is the court
called upon to hold a full-fledged enquiry or to
appreciate    evidence     collected  by     the
investigating agencies to find out whether it is

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                        10</span>

a case of acquittal or conviction.
</p>
<p id="p_25">27.11. Where allegations give rise to a civil
claim and also amount to an offence, merely
because a civil claim is maintainable, does not
mean that a criminal complaint cannot be
maintained.
</p>
<p id="p_26">27.12. In exercise of its jurisdiction under
<a href="/doc/1969991/" id="a_28">Section 228</a> and/or under <a href="/doc/903398/" id="a_29">Section 482</a>, the
Court cannot take into consideration external
materials given by an accused for reaching the
conclusion that no offence was disclosed or
that there was possibility of his acquittal. The
Court has to consider the record and
documents     annexed     therewith    by    the
prosecution.
</p>
<p id="p_27">27.13. Quashing of a charge is an exception to
the rule of continuous prosecution. Where the
offence is even broadly satisfied, the Court
should be more inclined to permit continuation
of prosecution rather than its quashing at that
initial stage. The Court is not expected to
marshal the records with a view to decide
admissibility and reliability of the documents
or records but is an opinion formed prima
facie.
</p>
<p id="p_28">27.14. Where the charge-sheet, report under
<a href="/doc/1187622/" id="a_30">Section 173(2)</a> of the Code, suffers from
fundamental legal defects, the Court may be
well within its jurisdiction to frame a charge.
</p>
<p id="p_29">27.15. Coupled with any or all of the above,
where the Court finds that it would amount to
abuse of process<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_31"> of the Code</a> or that the
interest of justice favours, otherwise it may
quash the charge. The power is to be
exercised ex debito justitiae i.e. to do real and
substantial justice for administration of which
alone, the courts exist.
</p>
<p id="p_30">27.16. These are the principles which
individually and preferably cumulatively (one
                                                   M.Cr.C. No.5819/2012
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                      11</span>

           or more) be taken into consideration as
           precepts to exercise of extraordinary and wide
           plenitude and jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/903398/" id="a_32">Section 482</a> of
           the Code by the High Court. Where the factual
           foundation for an offence has been laid down,
           the courts should be reluctant and should not
           hasten to quash the proceedings even on the
           premise that one or two ingredients have not
           been stated or do not appear to be satisfied if
           there is substantial compliance with the
           requirements of the offence."
</p><p id="p_31">           Thus, if the allegations as contained in the FIR are
      considered in the light of the judgment passed by the
      Supreme Court it would be clear that if the entire
      allegations are accepted in toto, even then no offence is
      made out against the applicant.
</p><p id="p_32">           Accordingly, the FIR in Crime No.27/2012 and the
      investigation against the applicant are hereby quashed. The
      application   under   <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_33">Section    482</a>   of   Cr.P.C.   therefore,
      succeeds and allowed.
