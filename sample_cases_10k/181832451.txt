2016          W.P. 8772 (W) of 2016


                  Sachin Patidar
                         -Vs-
          Sales Tax Officer, Durgapur Range &amp; Ors.

               Mr. Rituraj Chakraborty
                            ... for the Petitioner.
            Mr. Abhrotosh Majumder,
            Mr. Prithu Dudholria,
            Mr. Soumitra Mukherjee
                            ...for the Respondents.</pre>


<p id="p_1">           The petition is entertained for the limited purpose as indicated since the West

       Bengal Tax Tribunal is not functioning at the moment. The State has consented

       to the matter being taken up in this jurisdiction.
</p>
<p id="p_2">           The challenge herein is to an order passed by the Sales Tax Officer

       consequent upon the seizure of the goods under Section 76 of the West Bengal

       Value Added Tax Act, 2003.              By the order impugned, the petitioner has been

       required to pay a penalty of 25% of the value of the goods and furnish a cash

       security representing about 5% of the value of the goods in addition to payment

       of the entry tax.
</p>
<p id="p_3">           The State says that since the relevant provisions pertaining to entry tax have

       been struck down by this court, no claim is being made on account of entry tax,

       but the amounts on account of penalty and security have been arrived at in

       terms of Section 77 of the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_4">           Since it appears to be the fairly accepted position that in matters of the

       present kind, the Tribunal would require 10% of the value of the goods to be

       deposited as condition precedent for the release of the goods and in some cases
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                                  2</span>

waive the statutory cash security, the petitioner is directed to deposit half of the

amount demanded by way of penalty as condition precedent to obtaining release

of the goods without being required to furnish the statutory cash security. The

goods should be released within 24 hours of the deposit of the amount in terms

of this order, subject to the result of the matter before the Tribunal.

    The petitioner will be obliged to pay the entire amount claimed in terms of the

impugned order of May 7, 2016 unless the petitioner files an appropriate

application before the Tribunal within a period of four weeks from date.

    WP 8772(W) of 2016 is disposed of without any order as to costs.

    Certified website copies of the order, if applied for, be urgently made available

to the parties, subject to compliance with all requisite formalities.
