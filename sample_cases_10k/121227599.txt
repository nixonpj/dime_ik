     was found in possession of 84 pouches of illicit liquor without any 

    permit or license. 
</p>
<p id="p_6">    After the usual investigation, the charge sheet for the offence U/Sec 

    61/1/14 Punjab Excise Act was prepared against the accused.

        

</p><p id="p_7">2. The aforesaid  charge sheet was filed  before the court  on 23.11.01, 

    whereupon   the   cognizance   of   the   offence   was   taken   against   the 

    accused.

    to substantiate the accusation.

    therefore, PE was closed and matter was fixed for SA on 11.09.2012.




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">FIR No 578/01                       St Vs Geeta                          Page 3 of 5</span>
</p><p id="p_19">  9.  The Statement Of Accused was recorded U/Sec 281 r/w 313 Cr. P.C 

     on   08.11.2012   and   all   the   incriminating   circumstances   came   in 

     evidence were put to the accused to which the accused replied was he 

     was falsely implicated and he does not want to lead defense evidence.

</p><p id="p_20">                            The trial of the case hence concluded



      Now   let   us   examine   the   prosecution   evidence   brought   on   record 

      against the accused.
</p>
<p id="p_21">              As per prosecution story, the complainant HC Sainsar Pal and 

      Ct Devender Singh were on patrolling duty when they receive secret 

      information   and   on   receiving   secret   information   accused   was 

      apprehended   and   illicit   liquor   was  allegedly   recovered   from   the 

      possession of accused.
</p>
<p id="p_22">

</p><p id="p_23">           In the present case, prosecution has produced and examined 3 

      witnesses. The  testimony of all the witnesses are of formal nature.



      PW1 took the sample to excise office.
</p>
<p id="p_24">      PW2 was the MHC(M) who received the the case property and sent 

      the sample for examination to CFSL.
</p>
<p id="p_25">      PW3 was the DO, who registered the FIR of the case



      So,   it   can   be   observed   from   the   testimonies   of   the   above   for   3 


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">FIR No 578/01                          St Vs Geeta                           Page 4 of 5</span>
      Prosecution   witnesses   that   they   are   formal   witnesses   and   doesn't 

     deposed anything about alleged recovery of illicit liquor from the 

     accused.
</p>
<p id="p_26">

     Prosecution   failed   to   examine   the   recovery   witnesses   I:e 

     complainant HC Sainsar Pal and   Ct Devender Singh,   so failed to 

     bring   anything   on   record   to   connect   accused   with   the   alleged 

     recovery of illicit liquor.
</p>
<p id="p_27">

     Thus, in view of the facts and circumstances and discussion made 

     herein above, I am of the considered view that prosecution has failed 

     to prove its case against accused beyond reasonable doubt.  Hence, 

     accused is hereby acquitted in the present case.
