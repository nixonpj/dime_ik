        HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE ARUN BHANSALI
                       Order
20/08/2018

     Heard learned counsel for the parties on application filed by

the appellants under <a href="/doc/100581/" id="a_1">Section 5</a> of the Limitation Act.

     It is, inter alia, indicated in the application that the

appellants being rustic villagers and having a little knowledge

about the legal proceedings and on account of shock, which they

suffered on account of death of only bread earner in the family,

they could not file the appeal in time. Further submissions

regarding belatedly meeting the lawyer and being advised for

filing the appeal have also been made.
                         (2 of 3)                     [CMA-2335/2015]



     The record of the Tribunal was summoned, which indicates

that the compensation, as awarded, has been received by the

appellants on 6.1.2014, however, the present appeal has been

filed on 18.11.2015, regarding which, apparently there is no

reason indicated in the appeal.

     Learned counsel for the appellants submitted that the

appellants would confine the appeal on the limited aspect based

on the constitution Bench judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court in

the case of <a href="/doc/139996215/" id="a_2">National Insurance Company Ltd. v. Pranay Sethi &amp;

Ors</a>.: AIR 2017 SC 5157, as the multiplier adopted by the Tribunal

is based on the age of the parents of the deceased, whereas, the

Tribunal should have based the same on the age of the deceased.

Submission was made that as the appellants have raised issue

based on the constitution Bench judgment of Hon'ble Supreme

Court, in the interest of Justice and circumstances of case the

matter be dealt with.

     No reply to the application seeking condonation of delay has

been filed. However, the application was opposed.

     In the peculiar circumstances of the case, wherein, though

the submissions made in the application are apparently laconic, in

view of the submission being limited in the appeal, the delay in

filing the appeal is condoned.

     With the consent of the parties, the appeal itself is taken up

for disposal.

     As already noticed hereinbefore, the only issue pressed in

the appeal pertains to the application of multiplier by the Tribunal

which has taken the same based on the age of the parents at 11,

whereas, as the deceased was aged 32 years on the date of

accident i.e. 12.8.2012 as is reflected from Ex.31, which is copy of
                                                           (3 of 3)                        [CMA-2335/2015]



                                   his driving licence, wherein date of birth indicated is 27.7.1980,

                                   the multiplier in terms of judgment in the case of <a href="/doc/837924/" id="a_3">Sarla Verma &amp;

                                   Ors. v. Delhi Transport Corporation &amp; Anr</a>. (2009) 6 SCC 121 has

                                   to be applied at 16.

                                        In view thereof, the multiplier adopted by the Tribunal

                                   deserves to be modified and instead of multiplier of 11, a

                                   multiplier of 16 deserves to be adopted. The Tribunal has taken

                                   the annual loss of income after deducting 50% towards personal

                                   expenses at Rs.24,300/-, the same, therefore, based on the

                                   multiplier of 16 would be enhanced by Rs.1,21,500/-.

                                        Learned counsel for the Insurance Company submitted that

                                   as the appeal is delayed, the claimants are not entitled to interest,

                                   to which submission, counsel for the appellant has no objection.

                                        As already noticed hereinbefore, as there is little justification

                                   for the delay in filing the appeal, the claimants would not be

                                   entitled to interest on the said enhanced amount.

                                        In view of the above discussion, the appeal is partly allowed.

                                   The award impugned dated 31.8.2013 passed by the Tribunal is

                                   modified to the extent that the claimants would be entitled to a

                                   further lump sum of Rs.1,21,500/-. The amount be paid by the

                                   respondent No.3 - Insurance Company within a period of four

                                   weeks from the date of this judgment in the saving bank account

                                   of the claimants in terms of the award.

                                        No order as to costs.



                                                                                  (ARUN BHANSALI),J.
