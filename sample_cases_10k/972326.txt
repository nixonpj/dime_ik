:JUDGMENT
</pre>

<p id="p_1">(Judgment of the Court was delivered by M.CHOCKALINGAM,J)

		The sole accused in a case of murder, being found guilty under
<a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_2">Section 302</a> IPC and awarded with life imprisonment by the learned I-Additional
Sessions Judge, Tirunelveli, in S.C.No.350/1996 has brought-forth this appeal
before this Court challenging the said judgment.
</p>
<p id="p_2">		2.The short facts necessary, sans unnecessary facts, for the
disposal of the appeal can be stated thus:
</p>
<p id="p_3">		(a)P.W.1 Baliah is the brother-in-law of the deceased Karadimuthiah
and P.W.2 is his brother.  They belong to Thenpothai Village, within the
respondent police jurisdiction.  The accused Krishnan is also belonged to the
same village and they all known to each other already.
</p>
<p id="p_4">		(b)On 05.06.1994 at about 5.45 p.m., P.Ws.1, 2 along with the
deceased, went to the beedi shop owned by the brother of the deceased, where
they sat and were chatting.  At that time, the accused came over there and asked
for a beedi from the deceased.  The deceased answered that he had no beedi to
offer and if the accused wants he would purchase and give, for which the accused
saying "keeping beedies with you, you are refusing to give a beedi" fisted on
the stomach of the deceased.  The deceased fell on the ground upwards and
immediately the accused kicked him on his testicles.  P.Ws.1 and 2 went nearby
and found Karadimuthiah dead.  When they informed about the same to the brother
of the accused, both the accused and his brother ran away from there.  P.Ws.1
and 2 went to their residence and informed about the occurrence to their
relatives.  Thereafter, at about 6.45 p.m. they went to Shencottah Police
Station and narrated the occurrence to P.W.8 Sub-Inspector of Police, who was
present at that time and P.W.8 reduced the same into writing and Ex.P-1 is the
complaint given by P.W.1

</p><p id="p_5">		(c)On the strength of Ex.P-1 complaint, P.W.8 Sub-Inspector of
Police registered a case in Crime No.298/1994 under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_3">Section 302</a> IPC and prepared
Ex.P-8 First Information Report and despatched the same to the Court through
P.W.6 Constable.  He also gave information about the case to the Inspector of
Police, Courtralam over phone.
</p>
<p id="p_6">		(d)P.W.9 is the Inspector of Police, Courtralam Police Station.  On
receipt of copy of Ex.P-8 First Information Report, he took up the
investigation, proceeded to the occurrence place, made an observation and
prepared Ex.P-2 observation mahazar in the presence of P.W.3 and another.  He
also prepared EX.P-9 rough sketch.   Following the same, he conducted inquest
over the dead body of Karadimuthiah in the presence of panchayatdars and
witnesses and  prepared  Ex.P-10 Inquest Report.  During inquest, P.W.9 examined
witnesses and recorded their statements.  Following the same, P.W.9 sent the
dead body to the Government Hospital for postmortem,  through P.W.7 Grade-I
Constable, with Ex.P-3 requisition.
</p>
<p id="p_7">		(e)On receipt of Ex.P-3 requisition, P.W.4 Doctor, attached to
Government Hospital, Shencottah, subjected the dead body to postmortem at 12.30
p.m. on 06.06.1994. After postmortem, P.W.4 gave Ex.P-5 certificate, wherein she
has opined that the deceased would appear to have died of   neurogenic shock, 16
to 18 hours prior to autopsy.  After postmortem, P.W.7, who accompanied the dead
body for postmortem,  recovered M.Os.1 and 2,  personal wearing apparels of the
deceased, from the dead body and handed over the same to the Inspector of Police
P.W.9.
</p>
<p id="p_8">		(f)Pending investigation, P.W.9 Investigator arrested the accused
at 1.00 p.m. on 07.06.1994 and sent him to judicial custody.   He gave Ex.P-6
requisition to the court to subject the visera for chemical examination. The
visera was sent to forensic department for examination under court's letter
Ex.P-7 and Ex.P-4 visera report was received.
</p>
<p id="p_9">		(g)As P.W.9 Inspector of Police was transferred, his successor
P.W.10 took up the further investigation in the case.  He perused the case file
and the investigation done by P.W.9.  He examined some witnesses and recorded
their statements.  On completion of the investigation, P.W.10 Investigator filed
final report against  accused before on 19.10.1994.
</p>
<p id="p_10">		3.After following all the formalities, the  case was committed to
the Court of Session.  The trial court framed necessary charge against the
accused and conducted trial.  In order to prove the charges levelled against the
accused/appellant, the prosecution marched 10 witnesses and relied on 10
Exhibits as well as 2 material objects.  On completion of the evidence on the
side of the prosecution, the accused/appellant was questioned under <a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_4">Section 313</a>
of the Criminal Procedure Code procedurally.  The accused denied the evidence of
prosecution witnesses as false.  Neither oral evidence nor documentary evidence
was produced on the side of the defence.   After the evidence was over, the
trial court heard the arguments on either side and also paid its attention on
the materials submitted and after doing so, it found  the accused guilty under
<a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_5">section 302</a> IPC and awarded the life imprisonment.  Hence this appeal at the
instance of the appellant.
</p>
<p id="p_11">	  4.Learned counsel appearing for the appellant, while advancing his
arguments, would submit that in the instant case the motive projected by the
prosecution is so flimsy and the prosecution has not proved even that motive.
Learned counsel added further that the prosecution mainly relied on the evidence
of P.Ws.1 and 2, who are stated to be the eye-witnesses to the occurrence, but
they are interested witnesses, P.W.1 being the brother-in-law of the deceased
while P.W.2 is the brother of the deceased and thus they have come forward to
give false evidence against the accused and therefore their evidence cannot be
accepted.  He would add further, even according to the prosecution, about
11 independent witnesses were present at the time of occurrence and their
statement under <a href="/doc/447673/" id="a_6">Section 161</a> Cr.P.C. were also recorded, but no one of them was
examined before the Court of law.  It is the further submission of the learned
counsel that in the earliest document, namely inquest report   prepared by
P.W.9,  the presence of P.W.2 was not referred to and that would cast a doubt
whether P.W.2 was present at the time of occurrence. He would add further, there
is lot of discrepancies in the evidence of P.Ws.1 and 2.  According to P.W.9
Investigator, he started the investigation at 8.45 p.m., but according to P.W.1
it was at about 9.30 a.m.  Apart from this, in the instant case, the accused
goes over to the shop where P.Ws.1 and 2 and the deceased were sitting and
chatting and asked for a beedi from the deceased and for which the deceased
answered that he did not have beedi and not satisfied with the reply, the
accused attacked the deceased and caused his instantaneous death  but, according
to P.W.1 when the accused came over there and made a demand for a beedi to the
deceased, the deceased told him that he did not have it and if the accused wants
he would buy and give and this would indicate that P.W.1 could not have been in
the scene of occurrence and the occurrence could not have taken place as
projected by the prosecution.  He would add that the medical evidence also is
not supportive of the prosecution case.  It is his submission that inspite of
all the above aspects, the lower court has not considered those aspects but
wrongly come to the conclusion that the appellant was guilty of the offence
charged and recorded a finding so and awarded  life imprisonment, which requires
interference by this court and the appellant is entitled for an acquittal in the
hands of this Court.
</p>
<p id="p_12">	  5.The Court heard the learned Additional Public Prosecutor on the above
contentions.
</p>
<p id="p_13">	  6.The Court paid its anxious consideration on the submissions made on
either side and also made a thorough scrutiny of the materials available.
</p>
<p id="p_14">	 7.It is not the fact in controversy that Karadimuthiah, brother of P.W.2
and brother-in-law of P.W.1, was done to death in an occurrence that took place
at the time and place as put-forth by the prosecution.  Following the inquest
made on the dead body by P.W.9 Inspector of Police, the dead body was subjected
to postmortem by P.W.4 Doctor, who, after autopsy, has given Ex.P-5 postmortem
certificate in which She has opined that the deceased died out of neurogenic
shock.  Thus it is clear that Karadimuthiah, brother of P.W.2 and brother-in-law
of P.W.1, died out of homicidal violence.  It has to be pointed out that the
accused/appellant never questioned this fact either before the trial court or
before this Court and it has got to be recorded so.
</p>	
<p id="p_15">	   8.In order to substantiate its case that at the time of occurrence this
appellant fisted the deceased on his stomach and when he fell down upwards the
appellant kicked him on his testicles and as a direct consequence the deceased
died on the spot, the prosecution examined P.Ws.1 and 2 as eye-witnesses to the
occurrence.  It is true that P.Ws.1 and 2 are close relatives of the deceased.
But, merely on that score, their evidence cannot be discarded.  If the test of
careful scrutiny is applied, their evidence stood the test.  They have given in
their evidence a graphical analysis of the incident and there is no discrepancy
in their evidence to doubt it and their evidence inspires the confidence of the
Court.  Apart from this, the contention of the appellant that no independent
witness and in particular the owner of the shop in front of which the occurrence
is stated to have taken place, was not examined  cannot be a reason to
disbelieve the evidence of eye-witnesses, who have clearly spoken about the
occurrence.  Apart from that, in the instant case, the other discrepancies
noticed are minor most and they, at no stretch of imagination, would shake the
vigour or the truth of the prosecution case.
</p>
<p id="p_16">	  9.It is true that the name of P.W.2 does not find place in the inquest
report.  As per the settled proposition of law, non-mentioning of the name of
eye-witnesses in  inquest reports cannot be a reason to disbelieve their
evidence.  In the instant case, the medical opinion canvassed through P.W.4
Doctor, who conducted autopsy on the dead body of the deceased and Ex.P-5
certificate given by her are also clearly pointing to the ocular testimony
brought forth by the prosecution through the mouths of P.Ws.1 and 2. The ocular
testimony remain corroborated by the medical evidence and thus in the instant
case the contentions put-forth by the learned counsel for the appellant do not
merit acceptance.
</p>
<p id="p_17">	  10.In the instant case, the court is able to notice, for the flimsy
reason for not giving a beedi, that  too when a demand was made by the accused
to the deceased for a beedi and  the deceased replied that if the accused wants
he would purchase  from the shop and give him one, the accused has indulged in
such a merciless act of fisting on the stomach of the deceased and after he fell
down upwards, kicking on his testicles and causing his instantaneous death.  In
the circumstances of the case, the act of the accused in committing the crime
would clearly indicate that he got the intention and the knowledge that if done
so that would certainly cause injuries and such injuries in the ordinary course
of nature would cause death, which would attract the penal provision of murder.
The lower court is perfectly  correct in recording a finding that the appellant
is guilty of the offence of murder and awarding life imprisonment on him.  This
Court is unable to find any reason at all to interfere with the said finding of
the lower court.
</p>
<p id="p_18">	  11.The appeal fails and the same is dismissed.  The conviction and
sentence imposed on the appellant by the trial court is confirmed.  It is stated
that the appellant is on bail.  The bail bonds executed by him shall stand
cancelled.  The learned Sessions Judge is directed to take steps to secure the
presence of the appellant/accused and commit him to prison to undergo the
remaining period of sentence imposed on him.
