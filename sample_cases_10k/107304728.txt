Present:- Mr. Jaspal Singh Maanipur, Advocate for the petitioner.

                      ******

<p id="p_1">TEJINDER SINGH DHINDSA, J.(ORAL)

          Petitioner seeks appointment on compassionate basis.

          It is pleaded that father of the petitioner who was working as

Lineman on regular basis under the Punjab State Power Corporation

Limited, died in harness on 17.12.1991. At such point of time, petitioner

was only one year and six months old approximately. Mother of the

petitioner in the year 1991 made a request to the respondent authorities to

consider the claim of the present petitioner for appointment as and when he

attains the age of majority. Mother of the petitioner is also stated to have

died on 14.10.2008.
</p>
<p id="p_2">          Counsel submits that instructions dated 06.07.2010 (Annexure P-

</p><p id="p_3">5) had been issued governing the aspect of compassionate appointment.

</p><p id="p_4">          Petitioner having attained the age of majority in the year 2008

has been pursuing his claim to be appointed on compassionate basis under

the instructions dated 06.07.2010 (Anenxure P-5). It is argued that the

claim of the petitioner is under process and has not been finalized till date.




</p><p id="p_5">                               1 of 2

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2"> CWP No.37881 of 2018                         2</span>

In support of such contention, counsel would refer to memo carrying

endorsement dated 10.03.2017 (Annexure P-10) issued from the office of

the Additional Superintending Engineer, PSPCL, Distribution Circle,

Samrala and addressed to the Sub Divisional Officer, City Samrala, and

with a copy to the present petitioner calling upon for certain shortcomings

to be removed to process the application for appointment on

compassionate ground.          It is submitted that inspite of the requisite

documents in the nature of dependency certificate/income certificate etc.

having been furnished, no final decision has been taken till date.

</p><p id="p_6">              It is prayed that even a legal notice dated 08.08.2018 (Annexure

P-14) has been served and which also has not evoked any response.

</p><p id="p_7">          In view of the above and without even ascertaining the

correctness of the averments made in the petition, I deem it appropriate to

dispose of the writ petition with a direction to respondent No.2 to consider

the claim of the petitioner for grant of compassionate appointment, strictly

in accordance with law, against the backdrop of the legal notice dated

08.08.2018 (Anenxure P-14) and to take a final decision thereupon

expeditiously and in any case within a period of 3 months from the date of

receipt of certified copy of this order and to communicate the same to the

petitioner.
