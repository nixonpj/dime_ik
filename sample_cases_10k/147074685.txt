   defendant was involved or aware about this transaction.   Even the 

  witnesses of the impugned sale deed were husband and son of the 

  defendant.   The conduct of the defendant raises suspicion   in the 

  mind of this Court "why this transaction was not discussed at the 

  threshold by the defendant with her brother with whom the plaintiff 

  was living".  It is also a fact which has come on the record that the 

  defendant and her husband has given different addresses in the sale 

  deed Ex. DW1/2 despite the fact that they are living together.  The 

  defendant   has   given   the   address   of   163,   SFS   Flats,   Sector­11,

  evidence on the record regarding the legal needs and requirements

  sell and transfer the suit property to the defendant.   It is also an 

  admitted fact that the possession of the suit property is also with the 

  plaintiff, her son and family of her son.  It is also an admitted fact 

  that such a huge amount of Rs. 10,70,000/­ was allegedly paid in

  nobody was present there at that time from her son's side except the

  execute such a deed in such a fashion and manner that nobody will 

  accompany   her,   indicates   to   the   un­natural   behaviour   in   the 

  transaction?     These   circumstances   indicates   that   undue   influence 

  was brought upon the plaintiff to enter into a contract to dispose of 

  the suit property which was such as to preclude exercise of free and 

  deliberate judgment by the plaintiff.   It is the case of the plaintiff 

  that the defendant convinced the plaintiff for standing guarantee for 

  her and the plaintiff was under the impression that she is giving 

  guarantee for the defendant as requested by the defendant i.e. her

  and   conduct   that   the   defendant   was   having   due   and   active 

  confidence of the plaintiff for whom the plaintiff could sign any 

  document. The other important factor of the whole transaction is 

  payment   of   consideration   amount   of   Rs.   10,70,000/­   which   was 

  stated to have been paid in two installments of Rs. 4,00,000/­ and 

  Rs.   6,70,000/­     Such   a   huge   amount   was   allegedly   paid   to   the 

  plaintiff   but   the   same   was   paid,   if   believed,   secretively   by   the 

  defendant and her son to the plaintiff then too in cash which is not 

  permissible under the law.  It has also come on the record that the 

  defendant was not having the money to pay at the time of purchase 

  of the suit property and there is, except her son, no independent 

  witness who witnessed the payment of the consideration amount. 

  The   defendant   is   silent   about   mode   of   payment   in   her   written 

  statement whether it was by cheque or by cash.  The defendant has 

  neither disclosed the names of the persons in her WS from whom

  species   of   constructive   flow.     Undue   influence   is   used   in 

  contradiction   to   proper   influence   which   may   be   secured   through 

  affection bestowed or from kindness indulged.  
</p>
<p id="p_54">       In   the   English   decisions   the   expression   "undue   influence"   is 

  often   used   as   a   generic   term   to   cover   cases   of   absence   of   free 

  consent. "Undue influence" and "pressure" or "coercion" have been 

  expressed indifferently to express the same idea. The principal of 

  undue influence has been applied to every case where influence is 

  acquired and abused where confidence is reposed and betrayed. 

</p><p id="p_55">       The expression "undue influences" is one of ambiguous import. 

   It   is   not   confined   to   those   cases   in   which   by   virtue   of   some 

   dominant position, the influence is exerted to secure a benefit to the 

   person exerting it but extends also to cases in which a person of 

   imperfect judgment is placed or places himself under the direction 

   of one possessing not only greater experience but also such force as 

   that   which   is   inherent   in   relations   between   persons   in   unequal

       relationship,   custody   or   due   to   other   circumstances   and   by 

       exercising that influence, he took unfair advantage at his cost. 

       In deciding the question of undue influence as in most other 

       matters, an overall picture of the case will have to be taken into 

       consideration.
</p>
<p id="p_57">              Undue influence usually arises in contracts made between 

       relatives or persons in a fiduciary position but even as between 

       strangers   between   whom   there   exists   no   fiduciary   relation 

       certain   forms   of   coercion,   oppression   or   compulsion   may 

       amount to undue influence invalidating a contract.

        fair and free from undue influence.
</p>
<p id="p_59">           The   mere   existence   of   the   fiduciary   relation   raises   the 

       presumption of undue influence and the Court will hold that 

       transaction   to   be   bad   unless   the   presumption   of   undue 

       influence is rebutted by cogent evidence adduced by the donee.

  prove   that   the   plaintiff   had   knowledge   that   she,   in   fact,   was 

  executing a sale deed as regards the suit property.   The defendant 

  has also failed to prove that a sum of Rs. 10,70,000/­ was paid to the 

  plaintiff as a consideration as stated by the defendant in the WS. 

  The   evidence   on   this   aspect   has   not   been   substantiated   by   any 

  independent and cogent evidence rather it is contradictory in view 

  of cross examinations of DW1 &amp; DW2.  The defendant has also not 

  examined the persons from whom her husband took the loan of Rs. 

  10,00,00/­ to prove the factum of taking of loan from them.  Proving 

  the payment of consideration is very vital aspect in this case, merely 

  oral statement by the witnesses of the defendant that they paid sale 

  consideration   amount   to   the   mother   of   the   defendant   i.e.   the

  of   payment   of   Rs.   10,70,000/­   to   the   plaintiff.     This   is   more   so 

  because both the persons from whom the loan of Rs. 10,00,000/­ 

  was taken by the defendant, have not been examined in the Court.

  onus   of   proof   with   respect   to   existence   and   payment   of   sale 

  consideration amount.   Rather a suggestion has been given in the 

  cross examination of PW1 that she received the sale consideration 

  on 16.02.2009 and 17.02.2009, which suggestion is contrary to the 

  defence and evidence of the defendant and which suggestion itself 

  demolishes   the   case   of   the   defendant   regarding   payment   to   the 

  plaintiff.   The defendant in her affidavit Ex. DW1/A simply stated 

  about payment of Rs. 10,70,000/­ without any details though in the 

  cross examination, she stated that the amount of sale consideration 

  was given to her by her husband which was Rs. 10,70,000/­ and it 

  was given to her by her husband on 29.01.2009.  She further stated 

  that   this   amount   was   taken   by   her   in   a   bag   and   her   son   had 

  accompanied her at that time.  On the other hand,  DW2 stated in his 

  affidavit that his father arranged the said amount of Rs. 10,70,000/­ 

  and his mother paid Rs. 4,00,000/­ on 29.01.2009 to her maternal

   make the payment of Rs. 4,00,000/­ on 29.01.2009.   DW2 further 

  stated   that   his   father   further  arranged   payment  of   Rs.   6,70,000/­ 

  which was paid to his maternal grand mother on 16.02.2009 at the 

  time   of   execution   of   sale   deed.     DW2   further   stated   that   he 

  accompanied his mother to make the payment of Rs. 6,70,000/­ on 

  16.02.2009   to   the  plaintiff.    These  contradictions  are  material   in 

  nature and casts doubt on the payment of Rs. 10,70,000/­.

</p><p id="p_62">42.    I have no hesitation to hold, therefore, that the defendant has 

  miserably   failed   to   prove   that,   in   fact,   she   had   monies   of   Rs. 

  10,70,000/­ with her out of which her husband taken a loan of Rs. 

  10,00,000/­ from Sh. Vinod Singhala and Sh. Gaurav Singhala and 

  that   such   money   was, in fact, paid over by the defendant  to the

<p id="p_63">43.    In view of above circumstances as the defendant has failed to 

  prove   the existence and passing of the sale consideration for the 

  execution of sale deed Ex. DW1/2, I so hold that the sale deed Ex. 

  DW1/2 was not understood by the plaintiff as having a document of 

  sale in respect to her suit property to the defendant.   This Court 

  really fails to understand that how can the plaintiff who was not 

  having any other roof on her head, could have sold her property and

   delivered  the  possession of the same depriving her own son and 

  herself also from such a shelter by way of a sale to the defendant. 

  This Court can say by the very strong reason as discussed herein 

  above and hold that the plaintiff did not execute the sale deed Ex. 

  DW1/2 in such a mental and physical condition so as to understand 

  the   nature   of   the   transaction   encompassed     in   the   sale   deed   Ex. 

  DW1/2.  There is no documentary evidence on the record rather the 

  whole conduct and event points out niddle of suspicion towards the 

  defendant.
</p>
<p id="p_64">44.   There is no specific suggestion in the cross examination of PW1 

  or PW2 that the plaintiff, in fact, was in such a sound state of mind 

  so as to understand the nature of the sale deed Ex. DW1/2.

</p>
<p id="p_66">46.    In the facts of the present case in my opinion, absence of cross 

  examination is an important factor to hold that the mother was not 

  in the sound mental state for knowing the nature of the sale deed.  I 

  cumulatively   take   all   the   aforesaid   factors   with   the   fact   that   the 

  defendant has failed to prove that she paid the alleged consideration

   of   Rs.   10,70,000/­   to  the  plaintiff  and  accordingly,  hold  that  the 

  plaintiff did not execute the sale deed Ex. DW1/2 in such a mental 

  state that she had understood the nature of the same.  Even, in fact, 

  it is assumed that the plaintiff was in such a mental state of mind to 

  ordinarily   understand   the   other   documents   at   least   so   far   as   the 

  document   Ex.   DW1/2   is   concerned,   the   facts   and   circumstances 

  were so created that qua the document Ex. DW1/2, the plaintiff did 

  not   understand   that   the   document   was,   in   fact,   a   sale   deed 

  transferring the suit property to the defendant.  This become all the 

  more so because admittedly the transaction is  not based on natural 

  love and affection.  There is  no reason why a mother who is staying 

  with her son will preclude him or oust him from her property and 

  why the son was ousted by the plaintiff is not established.

  to tear evidential value of the statement of PW1 &amp; PW2.  Naturally

  The defendant has failed to prove the factum of taking loan of Rs. 

  10,00,000/­ as well as payment of Rs. 10,70,000/­ to the plaintiff as 

  discussed   herein   above.     The   Judgments   as   relied   upon   by   the 

  defendants i.e.  Ishwar Dass Jain (dead) through <a href="/doc/1794547/" id="a_2">LRs vs. Sohan  

  Lal</a> (dead) by LRs. (2000) 1 SCC 434 and <a href="/doc/1543769/" id="a_3">Roop Kumar vs. Mohan  

  Thedani</a>, AIR 2003 SC 2418, are of no help to the defendant in 

  view of the aforesaid facts.  The mere registration of the sale deed is 

  not  a  conclusive  proof  of  a valid sale between the parties.   The 

  essential element for the valid contract is free consent of the parties 

  entering into a contract and payment of consideration as in view of 

  the facts of the present case, which is not there in this case.

  a party in a suit, normally the burden is on him to prove such fraud, 

  undue influence or misrepresentation.   But, when a person is in a 

  fiduciary relationship with another and the later is in a position of 

  active   confidence,   the   burden   of   proving   the   absence   of   fraud, 

  misrepresentation   or   undue   influences   is   upon   the   person   in   the

    dominating position; he/she had to prove that there was fair play in 

   the transaction and that the apparent is the real; in other words, that 

   the transaction is genuine and bonafide.
</p>
<p id="p_69">             Free consent is deemed essential for every agreement.

             A   contract   induced   by   coercion,   undue   influence,   fraud, 

misrepresentation lacks this element.  If the consent is entirely absent, 

as in some cases of mistake, the agreement is void.   If there is an 

apparent   -   though   not   free   -   consent,   as   in   coercion   and   undue 

influence a voidable contract results.
</p>
<p id="p_70">             The contracts which are voidable for undue influence falls 

into two classes :­

</p><p id="p_71">(i) those in which there is no special relationship between the parties; 

i.e.   transactions   between   the   equals   (ii)   those   in   which   a   special 

relationship exists;  i.e. transactions between unequals.

</p><p id="p_72">             In   transaction  falling   in   the   first   class,     undue   influence 

must be proved as a fact.  In the second class, it is presumed to exist. 

In transactions between equals, it must be affirmatively proved that 

one   party,   in   fact,   exerted   influence   over   the   other   and   thereby 

procured a contract which otherwise would not have been made.   In 

transactions between unequals  undue influence is presumed, because 



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_35">CS Nos. 311/9/11 &amp; 310/9/11                                                        Page 36 of 50</span>
 confidence reposed in one party either endows him with exceptional 

authority   over   the   other   or   imposed   upon   him   the   duty   to   give 

disinterested   advice.     The   possibility   that   may   put   his   interest 

uppermost is so obvious that he comes under a duty to prove that he 

has not taken any undue advantage of his position and abuse it.  The 

burden of proof is different in the two classes of cases.  It is difficult to 

make a exhaustive list of persons against whom the presumption is 

raised.  The most familiar types of relationship are those of solicitors 

and   clients,   trustee   and  beneficiary, guardian  and  ward,  parent  and 

child, teacher and pupil, doctor and patient etc.  

             While   it   is   true   that   "undue   influence",   'fraud', 

"misrepresentation"   are   cognate   vices   and   may,   in   part,   overlap   in 

some cases, they are in law distinct categories.   If it is having been 

found that a donor in the case of gift was not upto an ordinary standard 

of intelligence and was under the influence of the defendants and the 

transaction   was  hopelessly  improvident.   In  such  a case,  the  Court 

shall be constrained to set aside the gift.  In a case, a  youngman who 

has   just   attained   his   majority   and   whose   mind   was   clouded   and 

affected by hemp smoking, sold his property for grossly inadequate 

consideration to his guru.  The Hon'ble Allahabad High Court set aside

 the sale on the ground of undue influence.  As such, a transaction may 

be set aside, as discussed herein above, on account of undue influence. 

</p><p id="p_73">           According to the description of undue influence in Sec. 16 

of <a href="/doc/171398/" id="a_4">Indian Contract Act</a>, there are three ingredients:

</p><p id="p_74">(i) that the relationship subsisting between the parties should be such 

that one of the parties is in a position to dominate the Will of the other; 

</p><p id="p_75">(ii)  that the dominant party obtains an unfair advantage over the other; 

and (iii) that the dominant party has obtained that unfair advantage 

while using dominant position.
</p>
<p id="p_76">           Thus it can be seen that contracts which may be rescinded 

for undue influence fall into two distinct classes :

</p><p id="p_77">   (i) these where there is no special relationship between the parties;

</p><p id="p_78">   (ii)  these  where   a  special  relationship, such as  parent  and  child 

      exists.
</p>
<p id="p_79">           In the first class, undue influence must be proved as a fact, 

in the second class, it is presumed to exist.
</p>
<p id="p_80">           The Court trying the case of undue influence must consider 

two ends to start with :
</p>
<p id="p_81">(i) are the relations between the donor and the donee were such that 

the donee is in a position to dominating the Will of donor;  (ii) has the 



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_37">CS Nos. 311/9/11 &amp; 310/9/11                                                   Page 38 of 50</span>
 donee used that position to obtain an unfair advantage over the donors. 

</p><p id="p_82">            Upon   the   determination   of   these   issues,   a   third   point 

emerges which is that of onus probandi.  If the transaction appears to 

be unconscionable, then the burden of proving that contract was not 

induced by undue influence is to lie upon the person who was in a 

position   to   dominate  the Will  of the  other.    Even in  this case, the 

defendants was in a position to dominate the Will of the plaintiff and 

that   the   defendant   exercise   her   influence   and   obtained   an   unfair 

advantage for herself, such a transaction was itself unconscionable in 

as much as the mother deprived her dependent son of her entire share 

in the property besides this, the plaintiff herself has not kept any house 

for her living or for maintenance.  The burden to prove thus lie upon 

the defendant is to establish that undue influence was not exercised 

and this they failed to establish.   The plaintiff is an illiterate widow 

aged about 72 years physically infirmed who was living with her son 

and family of her son and was not having any other property for her 

disposal or to live in.   The defendant was her nearest relative with 

whom she could confine and discuss everything in such an age, being 

a daughter of the plaintiff, even can discuss daily bickering   in the 

family of the son, his wife etc.   The defendant was obviously in a 



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_38">CS Nos. 311/9/11 &amp; 310/9/11                                                     Page 39 of 50</span>
 position   to   dominate   her   will,   the   transaction   in   question   was 

unconscionable   on   the   face   of   it.     Under   the   impugned   deed,   the 

plaintiff was deprived of all her transferable property during her life 

time.   More so, there appears to be no apparent reason to impel the 

plaintiff to deprive her son and the family, the right to inherit the suit 

property after her death.   In such a situation, the burden lies on the 

defendant to rebut the presumption and to establish by cogent evidence 

that   the   confidence   was   not   abused   and   the   transaction   was   not 

induced   by   undue  influence and the impugned   deed was executed 

under   circumstances   which   enabled   the   plaintiff   to   exercise   her 

independent Will.   However, the defendant has failed to establish by 

cogent   evidence   that   the   confidence   was   not   abused   and   the 

transaction   was   not   induced   by   undue   influence   and   the   impugned 

deed was executed under circumstances which enabled the plaintiff to 

exercise an independent Will.  In view of the conduct of the defendant 

and the way alleged transaction was done, it is abundantly clear that 

the impugned sale deed was obtained by exercise of undue influence 

and the transaction is of an unconscionable nature.  The defendant was 

in a position to dominate over the Will of the plaintiff. Moreover, there 

appears to be no apparent reason to impel the plaintiff to deprive her 



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_39">CS Nos. 311/9/11 &amp; 310/9/11                                                      Page 40 of 50</span>
 son with whom she is living to deprive him from inheritate the suit 

property after her death.   The reason given in the sale deed that she 

wants to dispose of the property for legal requirements does not appeal 

to the mind of this Court nor such cause/reason has been proved by the 

defendant.  There is also contradiction in the impugned deed that the 

possession has been given though no such possession was given to the 

defendant. In such a situation, the burden lie on the defendant to rebut 

the   presumption   and   to   establish   by   cogent   evidence   that   the 

transaction   was   not   induced   by     undue   influence,   fraud   or 

misrepresentation   and   the   impugned   deed   was   executed   under 

circumstances which enabled the plaintiff to exercise her independent 

free will or intent.  
</p>
<p id="p_83">49.    In this case, the defendant had made material misrepresentation 

  to   the   plaintiff   regarding   giving   of   guarantee   and   such 

  representation   has   been   made   with   the   intention   that   it   be   acted 

  upon by the plaintiff to be defrauded.  The plaintiff acted in reliance 

  upon such a representation and the plaintiff thereby suffers injuries 

  and entered into transaction and executed the impugned deed.  The 

  intention of the defendant is to deceive and/or induce the plaintiff to 

  enter   into   sale   contract.     The   plaintiff   has   been   induced   by   the 



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_40">CS Nos. 311/9/11 &amp; 310/9/11                                                       Page 41 of 50</span>
   defendant to enter into the contract  in question as discussed herein 

  above.   The plaintiff had no means of discovering the truth taking 

  into consideration the educational background, age and relationship 

  with ordinary diligence.  It can be inferred from the circumstances 

  by this Court, a fraudulent and dishonest plan by exercising undue 

  influence,   induced   by  the  defendant   to  get   the  alleged  sale  deed 

  executed by the plaintiff and there is positive material to this effect 

  on the record of this Court.  The assertion  of a false fact knowingly 

  by   the   defendant   without   belief   in   its   truth   with   a   deliberate 

  intention to deceive the plaintiff was originated by the defendant.

</p><p id="p_84">50.    Undue influence of the defendant on the plaintiff is also writ 

  large   and   apparent   from   the   facts   on   the   record.     Whatsoever 

  transpired   regarding the transaction in dispute was only discussed 

  by the plaintiff with the defendant and not even with her son and 

  daughter in law and their family members or any other relative even 

  of the defendant, the plaintiff went to the O/o Sub­Registrar alone in 

  such   an   old   age  without  disclosing this fact  to any other person 

  except the defendant either regarding the transaction or going to the 

  O/o Sub­Registrar before execution the impugned sale deed.   The 

  influence   exerted   by   the   defendant   and/or   the   influence   of   the 



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_41">CS Nos. 311/9/11 &amp; 310/9/11                                                      Page 42 of 50</span>
   defendant upon the plaintiff in such circumstances cannot be denied 

  and this Court is fully convinced that the plaintiff was in the undue 

  influence of the defendant.   Hence, it can be said that taking into 

  consideration   all   the   factors,   as   discussed   herein   above,   that   the 

  plaintiff was under undue influence of the defendant.

</p><p id="p_85">51.    I am satisfied that the sale deed is a result of influence expressly 

  used   by   the   defendant,   for   the   purpose,   in   view   of   the   relations 

  between the plaintiff.  The defendant at/or shortly and earlier also, 

  before   execution   of   the   sale   deed,   had   such   an   undue   influence 

  which   may   raise   presumption   that   the   defendant   had   undue 

  influence over the plaintiff and in such a case, I have no hesitation 

  to set aside the sale deed, since it was not, in fact, spontaneous  act 

  of   the  plaintiff   acting  under  circumstances   which  enabled  her  to 

  exercise   an   independent   Will   which   may   justify   this   Court   in 

  holding that the sale was the result of free exercise of the plaintiff's 

  Will.  In view of the undue influence, fraud and misrepresentation, 

  the defendant has got executed the alleged sale deed in favour of the 

  defendant and obtained unfair advantage.
</p>
<p id="p_86">52.    This Court is conscious of the fact that mere influence pressed 

  by   pursuation,   appeals   to   affections   or   ties   of   kindred   or   to 



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_42">CS Nos. 311/9/11 &amp; 310/9/11                                                        Page 43 of 50</span>
   sentiment of gratitude etc. is not illegal.   It is illegal only when it 

  destroys the free will of the testator.   In this case, it is seen and 

  observed as discussed herein above that the undue influence, fraud 

  and misrepresentation had destroyed the free will of the plaintiff 

  who under that executed the impugned sale deed.
</p>
<p id="p_87">53.    When we cumulatively take all the aforesaid factors, taken with 

  the fact that the defendant has quite clearly failed to prove that she 

  paid the alleged consideration of Rs. 10,70,000/­, in the facts of the 

  present case, it ought to be held and I so hold that the mother did not 

  execute the sale deed Ex. DW1/2 in such mental state that she had 

  understood the nature of the same.  In fact, even assuming that she 

  was in such a mental stage to ordinarily understand other set of facts 

  and documents, at least so far as the document Ex. DW1/2, facts and 

  circumstances were so created that qua this document Ex. DW1/2, 

  the mother did not understand that the document was, in fact, a sale 

  deed transferring the entire suit property to the defendant.   It is a 

  fact that this transaction is not based on natural love and affection. 

  Why would the plaintiff oust her only son, has not been established. 

  I, therefore, hold that the plaintiff was either not in such a mental 

  and physical state so that she could understand the document Ex. 



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_43">CS Nos. 311/9/11 &amp; 310/9/11                                                 Page 44 of 50</span>
   DW1/2 or even if she was otherwise in a reasonable mental and 

  physical condition to otherwise know the normal state of affairs qua 

  the document Ex. DW1/2, she did not understand that she was, in 

  fact, executing the sale deed of the suit property in favour of the 

  defendant.   I accordingly hold that the sale deed dated 16.02.2009 

  Ex. DW1/2 executed by the plaintiff in favour of the defendant, was 

  obtained by the defendant by playing fraud and obtained signatures 

  of the plaintiff on the printed papers, blank papers and stamp papers 

  without disclosing the actual contents of the sale deed.  I also hold 

  that the defendant had not paid any sale consideration to the plaintiff 

  for executing the sale deed dated 16.02.2009.   I also hold that the 

  plaintiff  is entitled to a decree for declaration of declaring the sale 

  deed null and void.  Accordingly, issue nos. 1, 2 &amp; 3 are decided in
