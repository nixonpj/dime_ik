                             .... For the Intervenor



                    When    the   matter   is   called   on,   Mr.   Gautam

               Chakraborty, learned advocate ably instructed by Mr.

               Rajkishore Das, learned advocate seeks leave to intervene

               on behalf of what he says is a Club being a Society

               registered under the provisions of the West Bengal

               Societies Registration Act, 1961. He submits that the

               machinery of this Court has been used in effect to

               encroach on the land of the said Club and measure the

               property in possession of his club even though the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                      2</span>




allegations made in paragraph 2 of the writ petition, in

respect of which the order of measurement and inspection

had been passed, relate to quite different lands.



</p><p id="p_4">      On the other hand, the appearing parties are at one

that the work of inspection as directed by me by several

earlier orders has already been done.



</p><p id="p_5">      Mr. Suman Sankar Chatterjee, learned advocate who

was appointed as Special Officer has filed a sealed report.

He says that the report contains enclosures being the

reports/ communication of the Amin and Block Land and

Land Reforms Officer. According to Mr. Chatterjee, learned

special officer, it was physically impossible to complete the

entire work of inspection because there is a water body on

the western side of the land and there is no passage to

circumambulate the said water body. As such he submits

that the Amin has complied with the said order to the

extent that it was possible for him to do.



</p><p id="p_6">      In this respect it should be noted that the Block
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                     3</span>




Land and Land Reforms Officer, ATM at Kasba and some

unspecified others preferred an appeal before the Hon'ble

Division Bench which was registered as MAT 144 of 2018

after leave was granted on their prayer to appeal by special

leave in the High Court by allowing CAN 972 of 2018. In

the order dated February 6, 2018 passed on the said

application costs were imposed on the advocate on record

of the writ petitioner for having added an officer of the

Indian   Administrative   Service   eo   nomine   instead   of

complying with my order dated November 17, 2017.

Naturally the Hon'ble Appellate Court took a dim view of

the matter and the said learned advocate who is a junior

member of the Bar was put to costs in terms of order dated

February 6, 2018. So far as the merits of my order are

concerned, it appears that the Block Land and Land

Reforms Officer and the Amin preferred the appeal against

order dated January 29, 2018 being aggrieved by the

direction to be present before the Court as directed by me

because they had refused to comply with my order on the

plea that they had no jurisdiction to comply with an Order

of Court since the land fell within the jurisdiction of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                     4</span>




Kolkata Municipal Corporation.       The Hon'ble Division

Bench was pleased to dispose of the appeal in effect

excusing their personal presence since they had already

complied with my order dated November 17, 2017 to the

extent that it was possible for them to do so, as recorded

above.
</p>
<p id="p_7">     I have recorded the above only to explain why no

further proceedings have been taken by me for ensuring

their personal appearance.       The order having been

complied with to the extent possible in the circumstances

aforesaid, their presence would, at any event, have been

unnecessary.
</p>
<p id="p_8">

</p><p id="p_9">      I have not opened the report of the learned special

officer because Mr. Gautam Chakraborty, learned advocate

for the interveners has made a prayer for intervention on

behalf of the Club as stated above on the specific plea that

the lands measured by the Amin are not the lands of the

writ petitioner as described in paragraph 2 of the writ

petition as directed by me.      He has therefore alleged

continued non-compliance by the Amin and the Block Land
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                      5</span>




and Land Reforms Officer, with the orders of this court as

passed from time to time.          He has also produced

documents in support of his contentions which are prima

facie reliable. However, there is no application on record

before me. I, therefore, consider it fit and proper to direct

that the matter be adjourned for the time being. Mr.

Chakraborty's client is given liberty to make an appropriate

application if so advised.
</p>
<p id="p_10">

</p><p id="p_11">      Let the matter come up ten days hence.
</p>
<p id="p_12">      Let the report be kept on record and no copy of the

said report be circulated for the time being. I record that

the report has not been unsealed. In the meantime, in the

interest of justice so that neither the Club nor the writ

petitioner nor any one else has a chance to disturb the

status quo in respect of the property in question keeping in

mind that on an earlier occasion submissions were made

that because of the local people and the club even

inspection was not being allowed to be made and on a

prima facie finding that Mr. Chakraborty's clients are in

possession of at least part of the lands of which
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                      6</span>




measurement was made, status quo as recorded above

shall not be disturbed for eleven days. This is only an ad

interim order which will not be extended, without further

hearing the writ petitioner.
