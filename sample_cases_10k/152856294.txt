                      Jabalpur, Dated : 17-09-2019

                      Mr. Anurag Shivhare, learned counsel for the appellant.

                      Mr. Vivek Ranjan Pandey, learned counsel for the State.

                      Mr. Rupesh Singh Thakur, learned counsel for the respondent No.2.</pre>

<p id="p_1">                      This is the second time criminal appeal under Section 14-A of the SC/ST
                      (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 has been preferred for grant of bail to the
                      appellant herein, in connection with Crime No.194/2017 for offences
                      punishable under <a href="/doc/1599401/" id="a_1">Sections 341</a>, <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_2">302</a>/<a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_3">34</a> of the Indian Penal Code and also
                      under <a href="/doc/1507082/" id="a_4">Section 3(2)</a>(v-a) of the Scheduled Castes and <a href="/doc/25085007/" id="a_5">Scheduled Tribes
                      (Prevention of Atrocities) Act</a>,1989 registered at Police Station-Tejgarh,
                      District-Damoh (M.P.). The first appeal of the appellant having been
                      dismissed as withdrawn vide order dated 28.03.2018 passed in Criminal
                      Appeal No.2156/2018 with liberty to file afresh after the statement of the
                      eyewitness are recorded before the learned trial Court.
</p>
<p id="p_2">                      The appellant is in judicial custody since 21.09.2017 and he      t
                      statements of eyewitness have been recorded. P.W-1 is the daughter
                      of the deceased, who has stated in her examination-in-chief that the
                      appellant alongwith co-accused Bhola had come there in a vehicle
                      and stabbed her father on the thigh and then went away. The similar
                      statement has been given by another eyewitness who is P.W-2, who
                      was also stated like this. Both these witnesses have not stated that
                      the appellant or another co-accused used any kind of caste based
                      words or disclosed by their actions that they were causingthe
                      injuries to the deceased on account of his caste. Prima facie,
                      appreciation of the injuries reflect that it is more a case under
                      <a href="/doc/1540253/" id="a_6">Section 326</a> of the Indian Penal Code rather than <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_7">Section 302</a> of the
                      Indian Penal Code as the injury has been caused on non-vital part of
                      the body.
</p>
<p id="p_3">                      Under the circumstances, looking at the period of incarceration
                      already undergone by the appellant herein and the statements of the
                      eyewitnesses recorded before the learned trial Court, I am inclined to
                      allow the appeal of appellant and direct that the appellant herein be
                      enlarged on bail upon his furnishing a personal bond in the sum of
                      Rs.50,000/- (Rupees Fifty Thousand Only) with one solvent surety in
                      the like amount to the satisfaction of the trial Court.
</p>
<p id="p_4">                      The appeal is finally disposed of.</p><pre id="pre_2">

                      C.C. as per rules
