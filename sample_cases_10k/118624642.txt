                                        Criminal Appeal (DB) No. 460 of 2018

                  ======================================================

                          HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE ARVIND SRIVASTAVA
                                        ORAL ORDER</pre>

<p id="p_1">                  (Per: HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE RAKESH KUMAR)

</p><p id="p_2">4.   06-07-2018                 Heard Sri Udit Narayan Singh, learned counsel

                   assisted by Sri Gajendra Kumar Singh, learned counsel for the

                   appellant and Sri Dilip Kumar Sinha, learned Addl. Public

                   Prosecutor.
</p>
<p id="p_3">                                The present appeal was admitted on 15-05-2018 and

                   lower court record was called for. While summoning lower

                   court record, a coordinate Bench of this Court asked the learned

                   State counsel to file written objection regarding prayer for

                   suspension of sentence and granting bail.
</p>
<p id="p_4">                                Sri Dilip Kumar Sinha, learned Addl. Public

                   Prosecutor submits that despite his best effort, he has not been

                   able to get instruction for filing written objection, however; on
 Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.460 of 2018(4) dt.06-07-2018
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                            2/3</span>




         the basis of material available on record, he tried to persuade the

         Court that it is not a case for passing order of suspension of

         sentence and granting bail. He submits that during investigation,

         it had come that looted articles were found in the possession of

         the appellant. Meaning thereby that looted articles were

         recovered from the possession of the appellant.

</p><p id="p_5">                      However, Sri Udit Narayan Singh, learned counsel for

         the appellant submits that recovery story was noticed during

         investigation, however; during trial, the prosecution miserably

         failed to produce so called looted articles and this was the

         reason that this appellant was acquitted from the charge under

         <a href="/doc/844968/" id="a_1">Section 412</a> of the Indian Penal Code. He further submits that

         during evidence, none of the witness has come forward to claim

         regarding identification of this appellant. Meaning thereby that

         in absence of any evidence of identification, the appellant has

         been held guilty and convicted for commission of offence under

         <a href="/doc/1119707/" id="a_2">Sections 395</a>, <a href="/doc/958439/" id="a_3">396</a> &amp; <a href="/doc/1865117/" id="a_4">397</a> of the Indian Penal Code.

</p><p id="p_6">                      Besides hearing learned counsel for the parties, we

         have also cursorily referred to the evidence on record and after

         going through the same, it is evident that none of the witness

         has identified the appellant and fact remains that he was

         acquitted from the charge under Section 412 of the Indian Penal
            Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.460 of 2018(4) dt.06-07-2018
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                                       3/3</span>




                    Code. Accordingly, we are of the opinion that it is a fit case for

                    suspending order of sentence and granting bail to the appellant

                    during pendency of the appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_7">                                 Accordingly, during pendency of the appeal, the order

                    of sentence dated 27-03-2018 in respect of appellant namely

                    Moharram Nut shall remain suspended and appellant is directed

                    to be released on bail on furnishing bail-bond of Rs. 10,000/-

                    (ten thousand) with two sureties of the like amount each to the

                    satisfaction of learned Trial Court i.e. learned Addl. Sessions
