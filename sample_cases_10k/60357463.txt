<p id="p_1">                    (PER : HONOURABLE MR.JUSTICE AKIL KURESHI)


</p><p id="p_2">           1. The petitioner has challenged the decision of Patan
                Municipality in awarding the contract to respondent No.6 in
                terms of resolution dated 27.04.2016.
</p>

<p id="p_3">           2.   Brief facts are that, the Patan Municipality had invited tenders
                for providing, supplying, lowering, laying, joining etc. for
                pipeline work and supplying and fixing pumping machinery for
                underground sump at housing scheme site in Patan city. Under
                notice dated 26.02.2016, estimated value of tender was Rs.
                25.87 lacs. The petitioner as well as respondent No.6 were both
                interested in such work and, therefore, applied in response to
                the tender notice. The final bid of respondent No.6 was the

HC-NIC                                 Page 1 of 3      Created On Sat May 07 07:19:18 IST 2016
                  C/SCA/7771/2016                                             ORDER



              lowest. According to the petitioner, however, respondent No.6
              was not qualified at all since he did not produce two
              photographs of the past completed work. This condition was
              imposed under para 5.3 (d) of the tender notice. Counsel for the
              petitioner submitted that the proprietor of respondent No.6 firm
              is a nephew of the President of Nagar Palika and solely with a
              view to favouring him, the decision has been taken though the
              agency is not qualified.
</p>

<p id="p_4">         3. Counsel for the petitioner placed reliance on the decision of
              Supreme Court in case of <a href="/doc/542379/" id="a_1">Sorath Builders vs. Shreejikrupa
              Buildcon Ltd</a>. reported in (2009) 11 SCC 9 to contend that the
              tender conditions must be strictly adhered to.
</p>

<p id="p_5">         4.   It is not the case of the petitioner that respondent No.6 was
              otherwise not qualified as per the rest of the tender terms. In
              short, his case is that, respondent No.6 did not produce the
              photographs of the past completed works. This condition must
              be viewed in the background of the nature of work involved.
              We may recall, the work is for laying down underground
              pipelines and supplying pumping machinery for underground
              sump. Essentially, therefore, the similar work performed by the
              interested agency would be in the nature of laying underground
              pipelines and other related activities. One fails to appreciate
              how there can be photographs of such completed work. If one
              peruses the photographs produced by the petitioner in order to
              fulfill this condition, it shows the dugout ground with pipelines

                 laying outside. By strict interpretation of the condition even the
                 petitioner would not be qualified since these photographs do not
                 show the completed work. Even otherwise mere photographs
                 would not establish the work experience qualification of an
                 agency. Primarily, we wonder why such a condition was
                 contained in the tender notice in the first place. It appears to
                 have been lifted bodily from some other past tender. Be that as
                 it may, considering the nature of work involved, this condition
                 must be seen as a non-essential condition. In any case, it would
                 not be safe to judge the experience of an agency from amongst
                 the photographs.

                 Petition is, therefore, dismissed.
