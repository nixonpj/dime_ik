<pre id="pre_1">          *IN THE HIGH COURT OF DELHI AT NEW DELHI

%                                     Date of decision: 5th December, 2014

+                         WP(C) No.150/2002

       NEW GREEN FIELD PUBLIC SCHOOL          ..... Petitioner
                   Through: Mr. Ashish Garg &amp; Mr. Sanjay Gupta,
                            Advs.

                                    Versus

    THE CONTROLLING AUTHORITY &amp; ORS. ..... Respondents</pre>
<p id="p_1">                  Through: None.
</p><p id="p_2">CORAM:-
</p><p id="p_3">HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE RAJIV SAHAI ENDLAW

</p><p id="p_4">1.     The petition impugns the order dated 18th July, 2001, of the

Controlling Authority under the <a href="/doc/553799/" id="a_1">Payment of Gratuity Act</a>, 1972 <a href="/doc/553799/" id="a_2">(Gratuity

Act</a>) in proceeding No.G 2/1/2000/Sough Region/5675 initiated by the

respondent No.3 Mrs. P. Satyavani, rejecting the preliminary objection

raised by the petitioner of the said respondent No.3 employed as a Trained

Graduate Teacher (TGT) with the petitioner School being not an employee

within the meaning of <a href="/doc/33143/" id="a_3">Section 2(e)</a> of the Gratuity Act and resultantly,

holding the proceeding initiated by the respondent No.3 Mrs. P. Satyavani to

be maintainable and listing it for evidence.
</p>
<p id="p_5">


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">WP(C) No.150/2002                                               Page 1 of 9</span>
</p><p id="p_6"> 2.     The petitioner preferred an appeal to the Appellate Authority under

the <a href="/doc/553799/" id="a_4">Gratuity Act</a> against the aforesaid order. The Appellate Authority vide

order dated 1st October, 2001 held the appeal to be not maintainable since

the final order had not been passed till then. The petition impugns the said

order of the Appellate Authority as well.
</p>
<p id="p_7">
</p><p id="p_8">3.     It is inter alia the contention in the petition that the respondent No.3

Mrs. P. Satyavani admittedly employed as a TGT with the petitioner School

was not entitled to gratuity as she was not covered under the <a href="/doc/553799/" id="a_5">Gratuity Act</a>, as

she was not an employee within the meaning of <a href="/doc/33143/" id="a_6">Section 2(e)</a> of the said Act.


</p><p id="p_9">4.     Notice of the petition was issued and vide ad-interim order dated 9th

January, 2002 further proceedings before the Controlling Authority under

the <a href="/doc/553799/" id="a_7">Gratuity Act</a>, stayed. Counter affidavit was filed by the respondent

No.3 Mrs. P. Satyavani and to which a rejoinder was filed by the petitioner.

On 14th August, 2003 Rule was issued in the petition and the earlier ad-

interim order made absolute till the decision of the petition.


</p><p id="p_10">5.     The respondent No.3 Mrs. P. Satyavani in or about the year 2004 filed

an application for early hearing stating that she was suffering from cancer



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">WP(C) No.150/2002                                                 Page 2 of 9</span>
 and in dire need of funds for her treatment. However, the said application

was dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_11">
</p><p id="p_12">6.     The respondent No.3 Mrs. P. Satyavani in 2006 filed yet another

application for early hearing on the same grounds.         Though the said

application was vide order dated 16th April, 2007 allowed but thereafter from

time to time when the petition was listed for hearing viz. on 16th July, 2007,

3rd January, 2008, 14th February, 2008, 10th April, 2008, 15th January, 2009,

5th July, 2012, 10th October, 2012, 11th December 2013, 13th December,

2013, 15th January, 2014, 20th January, 2014 and 23rd January, 2014, none

appeared for the contesting respondent No.3 Mrs. P. Satyavani. Today also

none has appeared for the respondent No.3 Mrs. P. Satyavani. I fear she

may have succumbed to her illness.
</p>
<p id="p_13">
</p><p id="p_14">7.     Mr. Ashish Garg, Advocate for the petitioner has been heard. He has

pegged his case on Ahmedabad Pvt. Primary Teachers' Association Vs.

Administrative Officer (2004) 1 SCC 755 and has invited attention to

paragraph 21 of the said judgment where it was held that on a plain

construction of the definition of an „employee‟ in <a href="/doc/33143/" id="a_8">Section 2(e)</a> of the

Gratuity Act, "teachers" who are mainly employed for imparting education


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">WP(C) No.150/2002                                                 Page 3 of 9</span>
 are not intended to be covered for extending gratuity benefits under the

<a href="/doc/553799/" id="a_9">Gratuity Act</a>. Mr. Ashish Garg, Advocate upon being asked, has also drawn

attention to the letter dated 31st March, 1991 of the petitioner School, of

appointment of the respondent No.3 Mrs. P. Satyavani. The same inter alia

provides that she was to be covered by the terms and conditions of service

and the scale of pay, allowance, medical facilities and other benefits in

accordance with the provisions of the Delhi School Education Act, 1973 and

the Rules framed thereunder.
</p>
<p id="p_15">
</p><p id="p_16">8.     I have drawn the attention of Mr. Ashish Garg, Advocate to Section

10 of the Delhi School Education Act which provides that the scale of pay

and allowances, medical facilities, pension, gratuity, provident fund and

other prescribed benefits of the employees of a recognized private school

shall not be less than those of the employees of the corresponding status in

schools run by the appropriate authority. It has been enquired from the

counsel for the petitioner whether the employees of the schools of the

appropriate authority i.e. Delhi Administration or MCD are entitled to

gratuity.

</p><p id="p_18">9.     Mr. Ashish Garg, Advocate seeks adjournment to verify and revert.

</p><p id="p_19"> 10.    However need is not felt to adjourn this matter which has already

remained pending for the last nearly 12 years, as in my opinion, the matter is

no longer res integra. <a href="/doc/553799/" id="a_10">Gratuity Act</a> applies to every factory, mine, oilfield,

plantation, port and railway company and to every shop or establishment in

which ten or more persons are employed or to such other establishments in

which ten or more employees are employed, as the Central Government may

by notification specify in that behalf. A Division Bench of this Court (of

which the undersigned was a member) in judgment dated 2nd December,

2011 in W.P.(C) No.6168/2010 titled Independent Schools' Federation of

India (Regd.) Vs. Union of India dealt with the said issue and

clearly covers the subject matter. It is not in dispute that the respondent

No.3 Mrs. P. Satyavani had ceased to be an employee of the petitioner

school on 10th November, 1997.         The amendment of the definition of

"employee" in <a href="/doc/33143/" id="a_19">Section 2(e)</a> of the Gratuity Act is with effect from prior

thereto i.e. 3rd April, 1997. The petitioner is thus clearly liable for payment

crystallized on 31st December, 2009, notwithstanding the same, this petition

remained pending for nearly four years thereafter. Not only so, owing to the

interim order in this petition, the proceedings before the Controlling

Authority under the <a href="/doc/553799/" id="a_20">Gratuity Act</a> also remain stayed. It has come on record

as aforesaid that the respondent No.3 Mrs. P. Satyavani at least since 2004

was suffering from cancer. We do not even know whether she is alive. The

counsel for the petitioner also has no instructions in this regard.

proceedings on the respondent No.3 Mrs. P. Satyavani and in case she is no

more, on her legal heirs, decide the matter expeditiously.
