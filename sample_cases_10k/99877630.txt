“25.    To sum up we are in
agreement with the decisions in
AIR 1964 All 199 and AIR 1965
Mad 98, to the extent to which
they lay down the principle that
when there is a sale to the Food
Inspector under the Act of an
article of food, which is found
to be adulterated, the accused
will be guilty of an offence
punishable under S.16(1)(a)(i)
read with <a href="/doc/198814423/" id="a_3">Section 7</a> of the Act.
We   further    agree  that  the
article of food which has been
purchased by the Food Inspector
need not have been taken out
from a larger quantity intended
for sale.     We are also of the
opinion that the person from
whom the article of food has
been   purchased   by  the  Food
Inspector need not be a dealer
as such in that article. We are
not inclined to agree with the
decisions laying the contrary
propositions.

<p id="p_5">26.     Coming to the case on
had, on the findings of the two
Courts the sugar in question has
been found to be adulterated.
The    purchase    by  the   Food
Inspector from the accused of
sugar for purposes of analysis
is a sale under <a href="/doc/27875011/" id="a_4">Section 2(13)</a> of
the Act.    <a href="/doc/198814423/" id="a_5">Section 7</a> prohibits a
person from selling adulterated
article of food.       Similarly,
under <a href="/doc/52407393/" id="a_6">Section 16(1)(a)(i)</a> any
person   who    sells adulterated
food commits an offence and is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                         4</span>


punishable therein.         The sugar
which is the commodity before us
is food under <a href="/doc/27875011/" id="a_7">Section 2(5)</a> of
the   Act.       We    have    already
pointed out that sugar by itself
is an article used as food or at
any rate it is an article which
ordinarily enters        into or is
used   in    the    composition     or
preparation of human food.          In
this case the sale was for
analysis and the article was an
article of food and in view of
the concurrent findings of both
the    Courts      that      it    was
adulterated,      the     respondents
have contravened <a href="/doc/198814423/" id="a_8">Sections 7</a> and
<a href="/doc/52407393/" id="a_9">16(1)(a)(i)</a> of the Act.          Hence
it   must    be    held    that    the
respondents      are      technically
guilty of the offence with which
they were charged and they have
been wrongly acquitted by the
High Court and the District
Magistrate.     But in view of the
fact that the appellant has
argued the appeal only as a test
case and does not challenge the
acquittal of the respondents, we
merely set aside the order and
judgment of the High Court. But
we may make it clear that apart
from   holding     the    respondents
technically guilty, we are not
setting    aside    the    order    of
acquittal     passed      in     their
favour.”

cooking/preparation               of   vegetables/food             in

rendered       by    the    High       Court    seems        to    be
