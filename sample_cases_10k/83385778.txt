</pre>

<p id="p_1">     The first petitioner is the Union of employees of the

Indian Naval Canteen Service and petitioners 2 to 4 are

employees of the Naval Canteen working at Cochin. They

inter alia seek for a direction that they are entitled to

receive their salary and other pecuniary benefits in

accordance with the recommendation of the 6th Central Pay

Commission Report (for short 'CPC Report') and further

seeks a direction to the respondents to revise the pay

structure and pay scales of Indian Naval Canteen Services

(for short 'INCS') Employees in tune with Part A of Section (1)

of the First Schedule to the Central Civil Services (Revised

pay) Rules 2008 with effect from 01/01/2006, and further to

restore the incentives for small family which was granted to

the employees of INCS from 1984 to 2010, continuously.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">W.P.C.No.32100/11            2</span>




</p><p id="p_2">      2.    The facts involved in the above case would

disclose that INCS is an establishment, which caters to the

requirements of Indian Navy and they are bound by

regulations known as Indian Naval Canteen Service

Regulations 1976 (for short 'INCS Regulation') which is

produced as Ext.P4.      According to the petitioners, the

employees of INCS is part and parcel of Indian Navy and

they were given revision of scale of pay and other

perquisites on the basis of 3rd, 4thand 5th CPC     Report.

However, when the 6th CPC Report was published, they were

not treated on par with Central Government employees and

they were not given the benefits of the 6th CPC Report. The

petitioners submit that the 1976 INCS Regulation was

amended by the Indian Naval Canteen Control Board (for

short 'INCCB') in 2008 after the implementation of the 6th

CPC Report.      According to the petitioners, the intention

behind the amendment was to extract maximum output

from the civilian employees of INCS and to deny the service

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">W.P.C.No.32100/11              3</span>




benefits granted to the employees by treating them on par

with Central Government employees. According to them, by

deletion of Clause 5 of the 1976 INCS Regulations, the

protection     given to   the   civilian employees    of   the

organisation     by treating   them    as  naval  force   was

conspicuously avoided. It is, therefore, their contention that

it was only by virtue of the amendment that they are not

treated on par with Central Government employees.

</p><p id="p_3">      3.    The petitioners contend that when they are

included within the definition of Naval Force and are working

under Naval Establishment in INCS and by virtue of the

amendment made to the INCS Regulations, INCCB had

implemented a pay scale of its own which has no connection

whatsoever with the pay scale of Central Government

employees. Hence it is contended that this action of INCCB

is arbitrary, illegal and violative of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_1">Article 14</a> of the

Constitution of India. It is also contended that INCS is an

authority constituted and established by the Government of

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">W.P.C.No.32100/11              4</span>




India and the Bombay High Court has admitted that INCS is

a naval establishment by the Government of India and it is

coming under the direct control of Indian Navy and hence

amenable to the jurisdiction of this Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_2">Article 226</a>

of the Constitution of India. It is also contended that INCS is

to be treated as an instrumentality of the State coming

under <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_3">Article 12</a> of the Constitution of India.

</p><p id="p_4">      4.    Another argument raised is that all along the

employees of the INCS were granted all the service benefits

of Central Government employees when it was revised or

modified from time to time and thus they have acquired a

legitimate right and legitimate expectation to continue to

receive the same salary and other benefits as that of Central

Government employees. Petitioners also rely upon Ext.P15,

a clarification issued by the Ministry of Finance stating that

the 6th CPC recommendation can be extended to the

employees of Autonomous organisation, quasi Governmental

Organisation etc. whose pattern of emoluments, structure

etc. are identical to those of Central Government employees.

Therefore, it is the contention of the petitioners that if the

autonomous bodies are in a position to bear the additional

expenditure on account of upgradation of pay scales,

nothing prevents the INCCB to provide the very same perks

to the INCS employees as well.
</p>
<p id="p_5">      5.    Counter affidavit is filed by the 5th respondent

inter alia contending that the writ petition            is not

maintainable as INCS is not a State or other authority within

the meaning of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_4">Article 12</a> of the Constitution of India and as

long as the respondent authorities are not carrying out any

public function, the petitioners are not entitled to invoke the

jurisdiction of this Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_5">Article 226</a> of the Constitution

of India. Further the respondent narrates the constitution

and formation of INCS. It is stated that INCS, was established

in 1947 by the Government of India as a business concern

vide Navy Instruction 60/47 so as to supply house-hold items

to ships and establishments, defence personnel and their

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">W.P.C.No.32100/11             6</span>




families including ex-servicemen and civilians paid from

Defence Estimates. The Government of India is not having

any responsibility for its business as there is no statutory

obligation on the part of Government of India to provide

canteen facilities to its employees. All the three Defence

Forces of the Nation have Non-Public Fund Organisations for

general welfare of the troops which are managed internally

by the respective service. INCS is one among such Non-

Public Fund Organisation under the control of Indian Navy.

The five INCS canteens in the Navy, including the one at

Kochi are registered as Unit Run Canteens (URCs) with CSD

in line with over 3900 canteens of the Defence Services.

URCs, including the INCS are purely private ventures of the

Services and their employees are not Government Servants

as these employees are neither paid from Defence Estimates

nor from the consolidated fund of India but from its profit,

which is a non-public fund in nature called Indian Navy

Amenities Funds. The Government has no liability in its

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">W.P.C.No.32100/11             7</span>




financial loss as a business concern. Profits generated from

Unit Run Canteens, including INCS are not credited to

consolidated fund of India but distributed to Non-Public Fund

which is used for the welfare of the troops.      Reliance is

placed to the judgment in Civil Appeal No.3495 of 2005

which is produced as Exhibit R5(c). Further INCS is directly

controlled      by Naval   Headquarters,    now   Integrated

headquarters of Ministry of Defence (Navy) and the policy

regarding day-to-day functioning of INCS is framed and

promulgated by the INCCB.      Therefore according to them

INCCB is having absolute powers with regard to the

administration and control of INCS. It is in order to

administer the functioning of INCS, that INCS Constitution,

was published on 3rd March 1976, and the regulations have

been modified by the Board from time to time depending on

the need of the organisation. The regulation of the business

including the recruitment, promotion and terms and

conditions of the employees of INCS are regulated by INCS

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">W.P.C.No.32100/11              8</span>




Regulations, which has since been superseded by INCS

Regulation, 2008 produced as Exhibit R5(h). The terms and

conditions for the service in INCS have been promulgated in

the INCS Regulation and the         petitioners have given

necessary undertaking to the effect that they have read and

understood those service conditions. The employees of INCS

are being paid from the profits of the business made by the

Organisation and there is no provision for payment on par

with the Government Servants or adopting the pay structure

as recommended by the 6th Central Pay Commission. The 6th

Central Pay Commission Report has no reference to the INCS

staff as they are not Government Servants.       Since the

service conditions of INCS employees are governed by the

regulations framed by the INCCB and the employees are not

governed by the Fundamental Rules, they are not entitled to

the status of Government Servants. The pay and allowances

of the staffs of INCS have been revised with retrospective

effect from 01/01/2006 vide Ext.P20 order dated 12/12/2008.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">W.P.C.No.32100/11               9</span>




As per Exhibit P20 order, the arrears of pay and allowances

were worked out to Rs.2.73 crores and the monthly

expenditure to Rs.14 lakhs.          Therefore there was a

reasonable revision in the pay scales of the petitioners.

</p><p id="p_6">      6.    It is further contended that with reference to the

earlier pay revisions for the INCS staff, the same was

considered       by    INCCB    and    had    approved     the

recommendations made by the said Board. It never adopted

the identical pay scales as that of the Government service.

Only fixation of pay has been adopted from CCS (Revised

Pay) Rules. It is also contended that since most of the posts

in INCS are not in the Central Government cadres, it cannot

be said that the scales were identical.         Further, it is

contended that pay revision of every 10 years have been

implemented by INCCB and it is not based on the

recommendations        of   the  pay    commission    or  the

Government. As per INCS Regulations, pay revisions are to

be    made       whenever   Pay   Commission     Reports  are

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">W.P.C.No.32100/11             10</span>




implemented by the Government. Therefore, it is open for

the INCCB to decide upon the pay revision of INCS staff.

There is no question of adoption of the Pay Commission

reports. INCCB was following the procedure contained in

Swamy's hand book fixing the pay scale of the concerned

employees and further it is contended that the amendment

to the Regulations is not having any relation with the 6th CPC

report or pay revision for INCS staff. The different classes of

employees can also be distinguished by pay scales as has

been done in the past and it is contended that it is not

mandatory to accept the concept of grade pay and pay

backs in the case of INCS staff as they were not controlled

by the Central Government. Further, it is contended that

INCS is not a naval establishment under the control of the

Government of India whereas it is a business concern

establishment by the Indian Navy Amenities Fund.

<a href="/doc/705724/" id="a_6">M.M.R.Khan and Others v. Union of India and Others</a>

[AIR 1990 SC 937] and [1990 Suppl. SCC 191]. That was a

case in which a three Judge Bench of the Supreme Court

considered the question as to whether statutory canteens,

non-statutory recognised canteens and non-statutory un-

recognised canteens of Railway establishment were under

the direct control of railway administration and whether

employees of such establishments could be treated as

Railway employees.     The Supreme Court held that the

employees of statutory canteens as well as non-statutory

recognised canteens have to be treated as employees of

railway establishment whereas employees of non-statutory

non-recognised canteens cannot be treated as employees of

railway administration. While considering the said issue, the

Supreme Court had occasion to evaluate the manner in

which the employees of such canteens were employed, their

terms and conditions of service as well as the extent of

control the railway establishment had on such employees

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">W.P.C.No.32100/11              12</span>




and it is held as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">      "25. Since in terms of the Rules made by the

      State Governments under Section 46 of the Act, it

      is obligatory on the railway administration to

      provide a canteen, and the canteens in question

      have been established pursuant to the said

      provision there is no difficulty in holding that the

      canteens are incidental to or connected with the

      manufacturing process or the subject of the

      manufacturing process. The provision of the

      canteen is deemed by the statute as a necessary

      concomitant    of   the   manufacturing     activity.

      Paragraph 2829 of the Railway Establishment

      Manual recognises the obligation on the railway

      Administration created by the Act and as pointed

      out earlier paragraph 2834 makes provision for

      meeting the cost of the canteens. Paragraph 2832

      acknowledges      that   although     the    railway

      administration may employ anyone such as a staff

      committee or a co-operative society for the

      management      of   the    canteens,    the   legal

      responsibility for the proper management rests

      not with such agency but solely with the railway

      administration. If the management of the canteen

      is handed over to a consumer cooperative society

      the bye-laws of such society have to be amended

      suitably to provide for an overall control by the

      railway administration."</blockquote><p id="p_8">

</p><p id="p_9">      8.    Further,    with   reference     to    non-statutory

recognised canteens also, it was held that taking into

consideration the control of the railway administration of

such employees, they were also to be treated as employees

of railway establishment and it is held as under:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">      "36. These arguments can be dealt with together.

      In the first instance, there is hardly any difference

      between the statutory canteens and non-statutory

      recognised canteens. The statutory canteens are

      established wherever the railway establishments

      employ more than 250 persons as is mandatory

      under the provisions of Section 46 of the Act while

      non-statutory    canteens    are   required   to  be

      established under paragraph 2831 of the Railway

      Establishment Manual where the strength of the

      staff is 100 or more. In terms of the said

      paragraph, the non-statutory canteens to be

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">W.P.C.No.32100/11              14</span>




      recognised have to be approved of by the Railway

      Board in advance. Every railway administration

      seeking to set up such canteens is required to

      approach the Railway Board for their prior

      approval/recognition       indicating     financial

      implications involved duly vetted by the Financial

      Advisor and Chief Accounts Officer of the railway

      concerned. It is only when the the approval is

      accorded by the Railway Board that the canteen is

      treated as a recognised non-statutory canteen. By

      the sanction, the details in regard to the number

      of staff to be employed in the canteen, recurring

      and non-recurring expenditure etc. are regulated.

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">      The    only  material   difference   between   the

      statutory canteen and non-statutory recognised

      canteen is that while one is obligatory under the

      said Act the other is not. However, there is no

      difference in the management of the two types of

      canteens as is evident from the provisions of

      paragraphs 2832 and 2833 which respectively

      provide for their management. Regarding the

      incidence of cost to be borne by the railways

      again, as far as the Manual is concerned, the only

      additional obligation cast on the administration, in

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">W.P.C.No.32100/11                15</span>




      the case of the statutory canteens is that in

      addition to the facilities given to the non-statutory

      canteens, the administration has also to meet the

      statutory obligations in respect of the expenditure

      for providing and maintaining canteens arising

      from     the said   Act    and   the  rules   framed

      thereunder. A perusal of the relevant provisions

      shows that the said Act and the rules made

      thereunder do not make demands on the

      administration for more expenditure than what is

      provided for in the Railway Manual for the non-

      statutory canteens. We have already referred to

      the service conditions applicable to the employees

      of the statutory and non-statutory canteens.

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">      Besides,    while discussing     the  case   of   the

      employees in statutory canteens we have pointed

      out the relevant provisions of the Administrative

      Instructions   on    Departmental      Canteens    in

      Government Offices and Government Industrial

      Establishments. These Instructions are applicable

      to both statutory and non-statutory recognised

      canteens. The Instructions do not make any

      difference between the two so far as their

      applicability   is   concerned.     In  fact    these

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">W.P.C.No.32100/11               16</span>




      Instructions require that the canteens run by

      engaging solely part time daily wage workers may

      be converted to departmental canteens (para

      1.3). Hence we do not see why any distinction be

      made between the employees of the two types of

      canteens so far as their service conditions are

      concerned.    For   this   very  reason,  the  two

      notifications of December 11, 1979 and December

      23, 1980 (supra) should also be equally applicable

      to the employees of these canteens. If this is so,

      then these employees would also be entitled to be

      treated as railway servants. A classification made

      between the employees of the two types of

      canteens would be unreasonable and will have no

      rational    nexus   with    the  purpose   of  the

      classification. Surely it cannot be argued that the

      employees who otherwise do the same work and

      work under the same conditions and under a

      similar management have to be treated differently

      merely because the canteen happens to be run at

      an establishment which employs 250 or less than

      250 members of the staff. The smaller strength of

      the staff may justify a smaller number of the

      canteen workers to serve them. But that does not

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">W.P.C.No.32100/11              17</span>




      make any difference to the working conditions of

      such workers."</blockquote><p id="p_10">

</p><p id="p_11">      9.    On the basis of the aforesaid law laid down by the

Supreme Court, it was argued that the employees of INCS

also stands in the same footing.
</p>
<p id="p_12">      10. The learned counsel for the petitioner relied upon

the following facts in order to substantiate his arguments.

</p><p id="p_13">      a)    During 1947, a proposal was submitted to

Government of India to set up INCS on an experimental basis

and it was based on Navy instruction No.60/1947 that INCS

has been formed. Ext.P1 is a portion of the said instruction

constituting a Central Board of Control consisting of various

officers of Navy.
</p>
<p id="p_14">      b)    In 1975, the Government of India in consultation

with Navy issued Navy instruction No.14/1975 approving

INCS on a permanent basis.
</p>
<p id="p_15">      c)    The Assistant Chief of Personnel (P &amp; C), Navy

issued order No.12/91 regulating the administration and

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">W.P.C.No.32100/11              18</span>




general control of INCS. Ext.P3 is the said document which

inter alia indicates that INCS is directly controlled by Navy

Head Quarters and the policy regarding day to day

functioning of INCS is framed and promulgated by the INCCB

on behalf of Navy Head Quarters.
</p>
<p id="p_16">      d)    In 1976, INCS Regulations were framed. Ext.P4 is

the extract of the said regulation. Ext.P4 regulations were

amended with effect from 11/04/1988 and the amended

Regulation is Ext.P4(a).
</p>
<p id="p_17">      e)    <a href="/doc/1780287/" id="a_7">Section 3(12A)</a> of the Navy Act 1957 defines Naval

Establishment as meaning, an establishment belonging to or

under the control of Indian Navy whether within or without

India.
</p>
<p id="p_18">      f)    Chapter 28 of INCS Regulations especially sub

Clause (2) of Clause 2802 indicates that "the canteen shall

operate as a business concern only, subject to such

instructions as may be issued by the Chief of Naval Staff

from time to time."
</p>
<p id="p_19"><span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">W.P.C.No.32100/11             19</span>




</p><p id="p_20">      11. Therefore the argument is that INCS is a naval

establishment.     The main argument is based on INCS

Regulations which inter alia indicates that INCS is being

administered by a Board constituted by Navy Headquarters

consisting of high ranking officers. The INCS is bound to

submit periodical reports to the Board and the profit of INCS

is to be utilised in accordance with guidelines issued by the

Chief of Naval Staff. The stores in the INCS is supplied by

Canteen Stores Department (for short 'CSD') and INCS is

constituted for the purpose of catering the needs of serving,

retired defence personnel and their family members. The

central Government is exercising deep and pervasive control

over INCS.
</p>
<p id="p_21">      12. Reference is made to judgment of the Bombay

High Court in Writ Petition No.2221/03 and produced as

Ext.P5 wherein according to the petitioner the Bombay High

Court has held that naval canteen service is established and

functioning under the control of the Central Government.

</p><p id="p_22">      13. Petitioner relies upon Ext.P6, a representation

submitted by the General Manager, INCS to the Chief

Minister of Goa requesting for exemption from payment of

sales tax indicating that INCS is a wing of Defence Ministry

and controlled by the Union of India.
</p>
<p id="p_23">      14. The order passed by the Administrative Tribunal,

Goa in Sales Tax 2nd Appeal No.02/94 is also produced to

prove the said facts.

<p id="p_24">      15. In regard to the claim made by the employees of

INCS it is contended that when the regulation of business of

the Board which includes recruitment and promotion and

terms and conditions of employees are regulated by the

INCS regulations they form part of Naval Force as defined

under <a href="/doc/1393512/" id="a_8">Section 3(10)</a> of the Navy Act 1957. In so far as INCS

had been constituted and formed to promote the comfort

and well being of the officers and soldiers of armed forces

they have to be considered as part of the Naval Force.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">W.P.C.No.32100/11              21</span>




</p><p id="p_25">      16. Reference is made to clause 2801 of Chapter 28 of

the Regulations which inter alia provides that the canteen

shall be established in each of the Indian naval ships for the

use of its personnel. The canteens were established not only

in ships but also in different commands of Navy. INCS is

formed as a naval establishment with head office at Mumbai

with five branches. As per the regulations, the funds of INCS

shall be "non-public funds". Petitioner further refers to Navy

order No.(special) 5/77 issued by the Indian Naval

Headquarters, conveying that canteen stores department

and INCS are not treated as non-public fund organisation by

the Navy itself.
</p>
<p id="p_26">      17. Further   reference    is made    to   Navy    Order

No.90/2002 in supersession of Ext.P3 which deals with the

activities of INCS and it is stated at clause No.16 that INCS

have to purchase all their required items from Canteen

Stores Department (for short 'CSD') and those things which

are not available with CSD can be obtained from other

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">W.P.C.No.32100/11               22</span>




sources. It is also contended that since the regulations have

been framed by virtue of the powers conferred under

<a href="/doc/1520952/" id="a_9">Section 184</a> of the Navy Act, the INCS is a statutory canteen

under the Indian Navy.
</p>
<p id="p_27">      18. Having regard to these factual situations, the

mooting question is whether the employees of INCS are

entitled to claim their revision in salary and other benefits

on par with Central Government employees or other naval

staff as the case may be. Before proceeding further, I shall

consider the defence taken by the 5th respondent, especially

regarding the scope of interference that is possible in the

matter. It is not in dispute that as per Chapter XXVIII of the

INCS    Regulations     provides  for the  establishment    of

canteens. Clause 2802 (1) clearly provides that Government

of India does not accept responsibility for the business

conducted by canteens and the Captain shall ensure that the

same is understood by all with whom the canteen conducts

business.     It is further provided under sub Clause (2) of

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">W.P.C.No.32100/11             23</span>




Regulation 2802 that the canteen shall operate as a

business concern only subject to such instructions as may be

issued by the Chief of the Naval staff from time to time.

Regulation 2804 deals with INCS run canteens. It is inter

alia provided that INCS is established under the orders of

Chief of Naval Staff and the funds of INCS shall be non-public

funds.
</p>
<p id="p_28">      19. Regulation 2811 specifically deals with non-public

funds and the manner of utilisation, accounting, audit etc.

</p><p id="p_29">      20. Therefore, even admitting the fact that the Board

constituting officers of the Navy has administrative control

over the Unit Run Canteens or INCS as the case may be, the

fact remains that these are operated out of non-public fund.

</p><p id="p_30">      21. At this juncture, it will be useful to refer to the

judgment of the Supreme Court in Union of India v.

Chotelay [1999(1) SCC 554].         The question that was

considered in that case was whether dhobies engaged for

the purpose of washing clothes of the cadets were entitled

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">W.P.C.No.32100/11              24</span>




for regularisation in defence service. The Supreme Court

observed that the terms of appointment indicates that the

Commandant of the Army had control over such Dhobies,

but nonetheless such control cannot impress the post of

dhobies with the character of a civil post. After referring to

paragraph 801 of the Defence Service Regulations, the

Supreme court found that since the payment is not made to

the dhobies out of the public funds but from regimental

fund, merely for the reason that the Commanding Officer

exercised some control cannot be a reason to conclude that

the posts are civil posts and payment to the holders of such

posts is made out of the consolidated fund of India or of any

public fund under the control of the Ministry of Finance.

Paragraphs 5 and 6 are relevant which reads as under:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_5">            "5. Para 820 provides for administration of

      such Regimental Fund and para 820(a) clearly

      indicates that all funds other than public funds as

      defined in para 801 maintained by a unit, which

      are financed either wholly or partly from public

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">W.P.C.No.32100/11              25</span>




      money. The Regulation further provides that the

      Commanding Officer acts as a trustee in relation

      to the "Regimental Fund" and is responsible that

      the Funds are properly applied with special

      reference to the object of the Fund and for the

      benefit of the personnel or unit as a whole.

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_6">      6. In view of the characters of the Regimental

      Fund as discussed above, we have no hesitation to

      come to the conclusion that the said Fund cannot

      be held to be a public fund by any stretch of

      imagination and the dhobis paid out of such Fund

      cannot be held to be holders of civil posts within

      the Ministry of Defence so as to confer jurisdiction

      of the Central Administrative Tribunal to issue

      directions relating to their service conditions. It is

      of course true that the Commanding Officer

      exercises some control over such dhobis but on

      that score alone it cannot be concluded that the

      posts are civil posts and that payments to the

      holders of such posts is made from out of the

      Consolidated Fund of India or of any public fund

      under the control of the Ministry of Defence."</blockquote><p id="p_31">

Unit Run Canteens of Army, Navy and Air Force were

Government servants and whether Central Administrative

Tribunal has jurisdiction over them under the <a href="/doc/195735/" id="a_10">Administrative

Tribunals Act</a> 1985 held that though the funding of Unit Run

Canteens is not made out of the consolidated fund of India

but it is made by the Canteen Stores Department and the

said department in its turn is formed as part of Ministry of

Defence, applying the principles laid down in <a href="/doc/1070998/" id="a_11">Parimal

Chandra Raha v. L.I.C</a> [1995 Suppl 2 SCC 611] held that

the employees working in the Unit Run Canteens are

Government Servants and therefore Central Administrative

Tribunal has jurisdiction to entertain the applications of such

employees under the provisions of the <a href="/doc/195735/" id="a_12">Administrative

Tribunal Act</a>. Further it is held that though they are treated

as Government servants by itself would not entitle them to

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">W.P.C.No.32100/11            27</span>




get all the service benefits as is available to Government

servants or even their counter parts serving in the CSD

canteens which would depend upon the nature of duty

discharged by them as well as on the rules and regulations

and administrative instructions issued by the employer.

</p><p id="p_33">      23. The judgment in Aslam's case was partly

overruled by a three Judge Bench of the Supreme Court in

R.R.Pillai v. Southern Air Commandant, Indian Air

Force [2009(13)SCC 311].       It is held that Aslam's case

proceeded on an incorrect factual premises after noticing

that URCs are not funded from consolidated fund of India. It

is also observed that the factual consideration in Aslam's

case regarding supply was also not correct in view of the

fact that URCs purchase articles from CSD depots and it is

not an automatic supply, and relation between URCs and

CSDs is that of buyer and seller and not of principal and

agent. It is also held that URCs are purely private ventures

and their employees are at no stretch of imagination

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">W.P.C.No.32100/11            28</span>




employees of the Government or CSD. It is also observed

that there was no statutory obligation on the part of the

Central Government to provide canteen services to its

employees. The profit generated from URCs are not credited

to the consolidated fund but are distributed to the non-public

funds which are used by the units for the welfare of the

troops.
</p>
<p id="p_34">      24. Having regard to the law laid down by the

Supreme Court in Pillai's case (supra) the question to be

considered can be narrowed upon. The learned counsel for

the petitioner relies upon the judgment in M.M.R.Khan's

case.    Having regard to the fact that INCS is admittedly

conducted out of non-public funds and not from the

consolidated fund of India, whether such a consideration has

been made in M.M.R.Khan's case has to be considered first.

In M.M.R.Khan's case the railway establishment was under

statutory obligation to conduct canteens and they had

established statutory canteens as well as non-statutory

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_28">W.P.C.No.32100/11              29</span>




canteens. As far as statutory canteens are concerned, the

occupier of a factory was liable under the <a href="/doc/1955064/" id="a_13">Factories Act</a> to

provide a canteen or canteens to its workers and the entire

expenditure is to be met by the employer.           The Railway

Establishment Manual also provides the statutory obligation

on the railway administration to set up canteens. Apart from

the control, the entire expenses were being met by railways.

But, in that case, the employees so engaged were not

treated as the employees of the railway administration. The

Supreme Court held that since in terms of the rules made by

the State Governments under <a href="/doc/759329/" id="a_14">Section 46</a> of the Factories Act

it is obligatory on the railway administration to provide a

canteen, and the canteens have been established pursuant

to the said provision, there is no difficulty in holding that the

canteens      are incidental   to  or    connected     with   the

manufacturing process or the subject of the manufacturing

process.     In regard to non-statutory recognised canteens

Supreme Court came to the conclusion that by virtue of

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_29">W.P.C.No.32100/11              30</span>




various Railway Board orders the employees of non-

statutory canteens were directed to be treated on par with

the employees of statutory canteens.         It is held by the

Supreme court that there is hardly any difference between

statutory canteen and non-statutory recognised canteens. It

is held that the only material difference between statutory

canteen and non-statutory recognised canteens is that while

one is the statutory obligation under the <a href="/doc/1955064/" id="a_15">Factories Act</a>, the

other is not so. It is also held that there is no difference in

the management of the two types of canteens as evident

from the various regulations. In regard to the incidence of

cost to be borne by the Railways, the only additional

obligation cast on the administration in the case of statutory

canteens is that in addition to the facilities given to the non-

statutory canteens, the administration has also to meet the

statutory obligations in respect of the expenditure for

providing and maintaining canteens arising from the

<a href="/doc/1955064/" id="a_16">Factories Act</a> and Rules framed thereunder. It is also found

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_30">W.P.C.No.32100/11              31</span>




on a perusal of the relevant provisions shows that the

<a href="/doc/1955064/" id="a_17">Factories Act</a> and the Rules framed thereunder do not make

any demand on the administration for more expenditure

than what is provided for in the Railway Manual for non-

statutory canteens.
</p>
<p id="p_35">      25. In that view of the matter, the Supreme Court

found that the cost implication as far as the railway

administration is concerned in respect of statutory canteen

and non-statutory recognised canteens is the same or

almost similar. Therefore, it is not possible to treat INCS and

the statutory and non-statutory recognised canteens of

railway establishment as similar organisations.       The very

fact that INCS is not being run out of the consolidated fund

of India by itself differentiates it with the factual

consideration in M.M.R.Khan's case and for that reason

itself M.M.R.Khan's case will have no application to the

factual situation of the present case.
</p>
<p id="p_36"><span class="hidden_text" id="span_31">W.P.C.No.32100/11               32</span>




</p><p id="p_37">      26. On a perusal of the terms of appointment of the

employees of INCS it is not in dispute that their

appointments are made on the basis of INCS Regulations

which are not statutory regulations. Those Regulations have

been framed only for the purpose of streamlining canteen

services and providing various facilities to the employees

concerned.       Ext.R5(g) indicates that INCS is established

under the orders of the Government of India. The object of

the organisation is to carry on business of purchasing and

providing foodstuff, provisions of all kinds etc. in order to

promote the comfort and well being of the officers and

Sailors of the Navy and to sell the same to the members of

the Naval Forces. In the Regulations Chapter IV deals with

finance and stores. Regulation 401 indicates that the funds

of the organisation shall be divided into three main heads as

determined by the Board namely Indian Naval Canteen

Service Trading Fund, Indian Naval Canteen Reserve Fund

and Building Maintenance Fund. Regulation 407 indicates

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_32">W.P.C.No.32100/11            33</span>




that INCS will purchase from CSD (India) all articles included

in the price list and will resort to the open market for

obtaining such articles which cannot be supplied by CSD.

Chapter V deals with recruitment and promotion and

Chapter VI deals with the terms and conditions of INCS

employees. Regulations 601 indicates that all employees

will be governed by the terms and conditions of service

contained in the Rules subject to alterations by the Board.

In regard to pay and allowances, it is indicated that the

same will be laid down by the Board from time to time.

Provisions are made for annual increment, leave, commuted

leave and other benefits. Chapter VII deals with the conduct

and discipline. The appointing authority in respect of the

various posts are specifically described. The Board is the

appointing authority as far as the post of General Manager,

Deputy General Manager and Group I posts are concerned.

General Manager is the appointing authority in respect of

Group II, III and IV.     The appointing authority is the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_33">W.P.C.No.32100/11              34</span>




disciplinary authority as well.
</p>
<p id="p_38">      27. Having regard to the Regulations, it is clear that

the formation of INCS is based on Government orders and is

not statutory in nature. Therefore, they cannot claim any

benefit by contending that it is a statutory organisation. It is

apparently an autonomous organisation formed at the

instance of the Government of India for the purpose of sale

of commodities to the Naval staff.            Their terms of

employment are covered by the Regulations. They do not

carry out any work with reference to or in connection with

Navy and their expenditure is not met out of the

consolidated fund of India.      Therefore, by no stretch of

imagination can such employees of INCS claim parity with

that of Central Government employees.
</p>
<p id="p_39">      28. True that employees of INCS are also entitled for

various benefits as provided in the Regulations or as decided

by the Board from time to time. True that their scale of pay

and other benefits are also increased from time to time

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_34">W.P.C.No.32100/11             35</span>




based on the prevailing rates as and when Pay Commission

Reports are being submitted. But the same is purely within

the discretion of the Board. If the Board decides to accept

the parameters laid down for payment of salary and other

perks on par with Central Government employees that does

not mean that the employees of INCS will have a legal right

to demand the same at all times. In that view of the matter,

I am of the view that the control exercised by members of

INCCB on the employees and staff of INCS by itself will not

give them a legal right to demand the salary and other perks

on the basis of the 6th Pay Commission Report as there is no

legal obligation on the part of INCCB to rely upon the said

recommendation of 6th CPC Report and extend the said

benefits to the members of the petitioners organisation.

</p><p id="p_40">      29. That apart, having come to a conclusion that the

appointment of the officers of the petitioner organisation is

made by a Board constituted by way of Regulations which

has no force of law but based on executive orders, I do not

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_35">W.P.C.No.32100/11                36</span>




think that the petitioners can claim any benefits against the

5th respondent by invoking the jurisdiction of this Court

under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_18">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India.         INCCB is

neither a State or other authority coming under <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_19">Article 12</a> of

the Constitution of India and it does not carry on any public

function in order to be amenable to the jurisdiction of this

Court.
</p>
<p id="p_41">      In the result, this writ petition is dismissed.
