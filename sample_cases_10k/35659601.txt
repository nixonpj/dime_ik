</pre><p id="p_1">i)Brief statement and reasons for the decision of the Case:-

</p><p id="p_2">           Complainant Shashi Aggarwal lodged her complaint with the

police of P.S. Roop Nagar on 17.09.2005. She alleged that on that day she

had left her house for her workplace i.e. ESI Dispensary, situated at Shakti

Nagar. She stated that at about 1.25 pm, when she reached near Ravindra

Public School, two persons came there on a two wheeler scooter and

snatched the gold chain which she was wearing in her neck.

</p><p id="p_3">2.         On her complaint, a case was registered. After registration of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                        2</span>

case, it was investigated. On conclusion of investigations, charge sheet was

submitted in the court for trial of accused Chand Miyan on the allegations that

it was accused Chand Miyan, who had snatched the chain belonging to the

complainant. It was further alleged that gold chain of the complainant was

recovered from the possession of accused.
</p>
<p id="p_4">3.          Copies of the challan were supplied to the accused. Finding a

prima facie case against him and considering the fact that accused had

refused to participate in the judicial TIP, a charge for the offence u/s 356/379

r/w <a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_3">section 34</a> IPC was framed to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed

trial.
</p>
<p id="p_5">4.          Prosecution was called upon to substantiate its case by

examining its witnesses. To do so, prosecution examined complainant, who

appeared in the witness box as PW1.           She during the course of her

examination, narrated the manner in which the incident had taken place. She

further stated that at the time of incident, she could not see the faces of the

persons, who committed the offence. She stated that she cannot say with

certainty as to whether, the accused facing trial was the one, who committed

the offence. She further deposed that the chain, recovered in this case by

the police, did not belong to her. She further stated that she had participated

in the judicial TIP of the case property wherein also she stated that the chain

recovered in this case is not hers.
</p>
<p id="p_6">5.          Considering the fact that complainant, who is the only witness to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                      3</span>

the incident, failed to support the case of the prosecution, prosecution

evidence was closed, as it would have been a futile exercise to examine

remaining witnesses.
</p>
<p id="p_7">6.         As complainant failed to hold the accused facing trial responsible

for the offence, therefore, statement of accused u/s 313 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_4">Cr.PC</a> was

dispensed with.
</p>
<p id="p_8">7.         I have heard the arguments advanced and have perused and

considered the prosecution evidence on record.

</p><p id="p_9">8.         Considering the fact that accused has not been identified by the

complainant during the course of trial and also the fact that complainant has

categorically stated that the chain, recovered during the course of

investigations, does not belong to her, I am of the considered opinion that

prosecution has failed to establish its case against accused Chand Miyan

beyond reasonable doubt.
</p>
<p id="p_10">9.         Accused Chand Miyan is acquitted of the charge and is set at

liberty. His bail bond is cancelled. Surety is discharged. File be consigned

to Record Room.
</p>
<p id="p_11">ANNOUNCED IN OPEN COURT.
</p><p id="p_12">DATED: 06.02.07
