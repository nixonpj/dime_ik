23-06-2017

Shri M.K. Mishra, counsel for the petitioner.
Shri D.K. Paroha, Panel Lawyer for the respondent-State.</pre>
<p id="p_1">Heard on this first application for bail under <a href="/doc/1290514/" id="a_1">Section 439</a>
of the Cr.P.C. filed on behalf of the petitioner
Shivmangal Singh in crime no.30/2016 registered by
P.S. Prakash Bamhori, District- Chhatarpur for the
offence punishable under <a href="/doc/661069/" id="a_2">Sections 341</a>, <a href="/doc/770961/" id="a_3">323</a>, <a href="/doc/267625/" id="a_4">324</a>, <a href="/doc/1086076/" id="a_5">294</a>,
<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_6">506</a> and <a href="/doc/1983271/" id="a_7">302</a> read with <a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_8">section 34</a> of the IPC.
As per the prosecution case, at about 7-8 p.m. on
19.10.2016, deceased Vikram Singh was going on the
tractor of Rajkaran Rajput to Baniyani. There were other
persons sitting in the tractor. When they reached Balaji
Mandir on the embankment of Munna Singh's field,
petitioner Shivmangal Singh and co-accused persons,
Shivkumar Singh @ Sikku, Shailendra Singh and Jalam
Singh came armed with sticks. They stopped the tractor
and abused the occupants. They challenged them and
declared that they would not allow the tractor to pass by
that route. During aforesaid incident, petitioner
Shivmangal Singh hit the deceased on head from behind
with a stick. As a result, the deceased Vikram Singh fell
down. Co-accused Shivkumar Singh @ Sikku struck 2-3
blows with a stick upon the head of victim Vikram Singh.
As a result, Vikram Singh became unconscious. Co-
accused persons Shailendra Singh and Jalam Singh hit
 the bonnet of the tractor with sticks. Thereafter, Vikram
Singh's companions took him first to Barigarh for
treatment and from there to Chhatarpur and thereafter,
he was referred to Gwalior. On his way back from
Gwalior, the deceased expired on 03.11.2016.
Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the
incident is said to have taken place on 19.10.2016. The
first information report was lodged by the father of the
deceased, Pyarelal Rajput on 28.10.2016, wherein the
name of the petitioner is not mentioned. The reason that
has been advanced for delay is that the father of the
deceased was busy in raising money for the treatment of
his son and he had accompanied the deceased up to
Gwalior for treatment. As per the post-mortem report,
victim is said to have died as a result of coma induced by
head injury. Medical papers reveal that in the District
Hospital, Chhatarpur, history of fall was given. In
Shubham Hospital, Gwalior again it was stated that the
deceased had fallen from stairs. In none of the hospitals,
it was disclosed that this is a medico-legal case involving
an offence, otherwise doctors attending upon the victim
would have informed the police on their own. There is no
mention of dimension and nature of injuries sustained by
the deceased on the head in any of the medical papers.
There is nothing in the medical papers to suggest that
the deceased had suffered injuries, which could have
been caused by sticks. In this backdrop, a long delay in
lodging the first information report becomes significant.
 The statements of the prosecution witnesses have been
recorded on 04.11.2016, after the death of the deceased.
The petitioner has been falsely implicated in the case. He
has been in custody since 11.11.2016; therefore, it has
been prayed that the petitioner be released on bail.
Learned Panel Lawyer for the respondent-State on the
other hand has opposed the application mainly on the
ground that there are several eye witnesses, who have
categorically stated that they have seen the petitioner
deliver 3-4 blows to the victim's head by stick after he
had fallen from the tractor; therefore, it has been prayed
that the application for bail be dismissed.
Keeping in view the facts and circumstances of the case
in their entirety particularly the facts as pointed out by
the learned counsel for the petitioner, in spite of the
statements of numerous eye witnesses, in the opinion of
this Court, petitioner deserves to be released on bail.
Consequently, this first application for bail under <a href="/doc/1290514/" id="a_9">Section
439</a> of the Cr.P.C. filed on behalf of the petitioner
Shivmangal Singh is allowed.
</p><p id="p_2">It is directed that the petitioner shall be released on bail
on furnishing a personal bond in the sum of Rs.60,000/-
with a solvent surety in the same amount to the
satisfaction of the trial Court for his appearance before
that Court on all dates fixed in the case and for
complying with the conditions enumerated under <a href="/doc/848468/" id="a_10">Section
437</a> (3) of the <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_11">Cr.P.C</a>.
</p><p id="p_3">Certified copy as per rules.
