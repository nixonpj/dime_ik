JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">1.      Briefly stated, the relevant facts of this case are that Sh. Bhagwat
     Prasad Bansal is proprietor of the complainant firm, who has filed this
     complaint. Complainant is dealing in the business of selling and buying
     fabrics and accused had been buying the same from the complainant for
     making readymade garments and for supplying the same to its various
     customers in country as well as in abroad. Accused no. 2 on behalf of
     accused no. 1, approached the complainant and purchased fabric for a sum


CC no.4853/07                                                             Page  1/7
      of Rs.72,684/- against Bill no. 1035 dated 20/12/2002. Accused no. 2 on
     behalf of accused no. 1, issued a cheque bearing no. 850427 dated
     28/12/2002 for a sum of Rs.72,684/-, drawn on Corporation Bank, Dilshad
     Garden, Delhi, against payment of aforesaid bill and assured the
     complainant that the said cheque would be honored on its presentation.
     Complainant presented aforesaid cheque for encashment in his bank
     account no. 1825 in Oriental Bank of Commerce, Gandhi Nagar, Delhi but
     the said cheque was dishonored with remarks 'Funds Insufficient' vide bank
     memo dated 13/05/2003. Complainant approached the accused and asked
     for the cheque amount and accused asked him to present the cheque again
     giving assurance for its encashment. Complainant again presented the
     cheque which was again received unpaid with same reasons vide memo
     dated 27/05/2003. Complainant again approached the accused but accused
     avoided the complainant on one pretext or the other. Complainant served
     accused with a legal demand notice dated 09/06/2003 under Registered AD
     of post and accused sent a reply dated 27/06/2003 making false contentions.
     Accused failed to pay the cheque amount within stipulated time period.
     Hence, the present complaint.
</p><p id="p_2">2.       Accused was summoned and was explained notice of accusation on
     04/06/2005 to which he pleaded not guilty.
</p><p id="p_3">3.       Complainant examined one witnesses in support of its case i.e. Sh.
</p><p id="p_4">     Bhagwat Prasad Bansal, the proprietor of       complainant firm    as CW-1.
     Thereafter, accused no. 2 was examined under <a href="/doc/224316/" id="a_2">Section 281</a> Cr.P.C. on
     13/02/2008. Accused examined one witness in support of its defence i.e Sh.
     Pawan Jain, authorised signatory of accused no. 1 as DW-1.
</p><p id="p_5">4.       Both parties filed their written arguments and made their rival arguments.
</p><p id="p_6">5.       Accused relied upon case law cited as '<a href="/doc/363129/" id="a_3">M/s. Kumar Exports vs. M/s</a>.
</p><p id="p_7">     Sharma Carpets 2009 (1) JCC (NI) 34'.
</p><p id="p_8">6.       I have given due consideration to the rival contentions and perused the
     record of this case as well as case law.
</p><p id="p_9">7.       Defence taken by the accused in this case is that he had no liability



CC no.4853/07                                                            Page  2/7
      towards the complainant as proprietor of M/s. Ritika Jain Enterprises. The
     fabrics were purchased for M/s. Urvi Creations Pvt. Ltd. and cheque in
     question from the account of M/s. Ritika Jain Enterprises i.e. accused no. 1
     was given as security      only. The cheque from this account was given
     because at the relevant time, cheque book of M/s. Urvi Creations was not
     available. His further defence is that payment was made to the complainant
     in respect of purchase made by M/s. Urvi Creations through a Pay Order. It
     was argued on behalf of accused that complainant has failed to establish the
     liability of the accused. My attention was taken to Ex.CW1/D1 to state that
     complainant has manipulated the bills according to his comforts. Carbon
     copy of this bill bears acknowledgment of receiving Pay Order for
     Rs.72,684/-, which is not a normal scenario because such acknowledgment
     cannot come on the carbon copy of the bill. It was further argued that
     Ex.CW1/1, which has been made basis of liability of the accused is also a
     manipulated bill and no such fabric was supplied to the accused. My
     attention was also taken to the cross examination of CW-1 in this respect.
</p><p id="p_10">8.       On the other hand, it was argued on behalf of complainant that accused
     has admitted his signatures on the cheque which was given by him and has
     also admitted that he had not given any notice to the complainant nor has
     filed any suit or complaint against the complainant.
</p><p id="p_11">9.       In P. Venugopal. Vs. Madan P. Sarathi 2009 (1) Civil Court Cases 054
     (SC) in paragraph 16 of the judgment, Hon'ble Supreme Court has observed
     as under:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">                "Indisputedly, in view of the decisions of this Court in
            Krishna Janardhan Bhat (supras), the initial burden was on
            the complainant. The presumption raised in favour of the
            holder of the cheque must be kept confined to the matters
            covered thereby. The presumption raised does not extend to
            the extent that the cheque was issued for the discharge of
            any debt or liability which is required to be proved by the
            complainant. In a case of this nature, however, it is
            essentially a question of fact."
</blockquote><p id="p_12">10.      I would also like to refer the judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court in M/s.
</p><p id="p_13">     Kumar Exports Vs. M/s. Sharma Carpets-2009(1) R.CR.(Crl) 478. In this


CC no.4853/07                                                            Page  3/7
   case, Hon'ble Supreme Court has explained in detail the scope of <a href="/doc/517539/" id="a_4">Section
  118</a> and <a href="/doc/268919/" id="a_5">Section 139</a> N.I. Act. The relevant observations made therein are
  as follows:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">               "The use of the phrase "until the contrary is proved" in
          <a href="/doc/517539/" id="a_6">Section 118</a> of the Act and use of the words "unless the
          contrary is proved" in <a href="/doc/268919/" id="a_7">Section 139</a> of the Act read with
          definitions of "may presume" and "shall presume" as given in
          <a href="/doc/750738/" id="a_8">Section 4</a> of the Evidence Act, makes it at once clear that
          presumptions to be raised under both the provisions are
          rebuttable. When a presumption is rebuttable, it only points
          out that the party on whom lies the duty of going forward with
          evidence, on the fact presumed and when that party has
          produced evidence fairly and reasonably tending to show that
          the real fact is not as presumed, the purpose of the
          presumption is over. The accused in a trial under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_9">Section
          138</a> of the Act has two options. He can either show that
          consideration and debt did not exist or that under the
          particular circumstances of the case the non-existence of
          consideration and debt is so probable that a prudent man
          ought to suppose that no consideration and debt existed. To
          rebut the statutory presumptions an accused is not expected
          to prove his defence beyond reasonable doubt as is expected
          of the complainant in a criminal trial. The accused may
          adduce direct evidence to prove that the note in question was
          not supported by consideration and that there was no debt or
          liability to be discharged by him. However, the court need not
          insist in every case that the accused should disprove the non-</blockquote>
<p id="p_14">          existence of consideration and debt by leading direct
          evidence because the existence of negative evidence is
          neither possible nor contemplated. At the same time, it is
          clear that bare denial of the passing of the consideration and
          existence of debt, apparently would not serve the purpose of
          the accused. Something which is probable has to be brought
          on record for getting the burden of proof shifted to the
          complainant. To disprove the presumptions, the accused
          should bring on record such facts and circumstances, upon
          consideration of which, the court may either believe that the
          consideration and debt did not exist or their non-existence
          was so probable that a prudent man would under the
          circumstances of the case, act upon the plea that they did
          not exist. Apart from adducing direct evidence to prove that
          the note in question was not supported by consideration or
          that he had not incurred any debt or liability, the accused may
          also rely upon circumstantial evidence and if the
          circumstances so relied upon are compelling, the burden may


CC no.4853/07                                                          Page  4/7
            likewise shift again on to the complainant. The accused may
           also rely upon presumptions of fact, for instance, those
           mentioned in <a href="/doc/731516/" id="a_10">Section 114</a> of the Evidence Act to rebut the
           presumptions arising under <a href="/doc/517539/" id="a_11">Sections 118</a> and <a href="/doc/268919/" id="a_12">139</a> of the Act.
           The accused has also an option to prove the non-existence
           of consideration and debt or liability either by letting in
           evidence or in some clear and exceptional cases, from the
           case set out by the complainant, that is, the averments in the
           complaint, the case set out in the statutory notice and
           evidence adduced by the complainant during the trial. Once
           such rebuttal evidence is adduced and accepted by the court,
           having regard to all the circumstances of the case and the
           preponderance of probabilities, the evidential burden shifts
           back to the complainant and, thereafter, the presumptions
           under <a href="/doc/517539/" id="a_13">Sections 118</a> and <a href="/doc/268919/" id="a_14">139</a> of the Act will not again come to
           the complainant's rescue."
</p><p id="p_15">11.   When, CW-1 was confronted with Ex.CW1/D1, he did not dispute that
  such bill was raised by him. In his cross examination, he also admitted that
  the original copy of this bill was given to Sh. Shanker, who allegedly used to
  receive the goods on behalf of accused, on 11/12/2002. He further admitted
  that he was not in possession of original copy of this bill on 10/01/2003,
  when he received the Pay Order for Rs.72,684/-. He was given suggestion
  that the amount of Rs.425/- at point A in this bill was fabricated so as to bring
  the amount of Draft in parity with the bill. He admitted that he had not shown
  the transaction of the bill in Ex.CW1/D1 in his Income Tax return. While, on
  the other hand, he has shown credit and debit in his Income Tax return from
  all the sources. He admitted that the fabric measuring 2474.9 meters was
  returned to him by accused vide Mark A. He deposed that this material was
  returned by M/s. Urvi Creations and material against the returned materials
  was again delivered to the accused but no bill was raised in respect of
  same. Thereafter, he again deposed that he had challan of returning the
  fabrics to the accused. However, he did not produce such challan before the
  court.
</p><p id="p_16">12.   It is not in dispute that the same complainant had transaction with same
  accused in the name of different proprietorship firm. The possibility of
  handing over the cheque in question as security for transaction made on



CC no.4853/07                                                            Page  5/7
   behalf of M/s. Urvi Creations cannot be ruled out. Complainant was under
  duty to establish the liability of accused beyond all reasonable doubts. The
  acknowledgment of Pay Order on carbon copy of a bill lying with the
  complainant is an abnormal scenario. The acknowledgment is given to the
  other party, who delivers such Pay Order. Therefore, such acknowledgment
  in the carbon copy of the complainant could not have been recorded.
  Complainant has kept mum that under what circumstances, a Pay Order of
  same amount was received by him through an acknowledgment on the
  carbon copy of the bill maintained by him. The scenario raises doubt over
  modus operandi of the complainant. The cheque on its bare perusal shows
  that it was filled in with a different ink and was signed with a different ink.
  Complainant has argued that bill Ex.CW1/D1 dated 11/12/2002 was a
  separate bill in respect of separate transaction with M/s. Urvi Creations and
  the bill Ex.CW1/1 dated 20/12/2002 is a separate bill in respect of
  transaction with accused no. 1 firm. Ex.CW1/1 and Ex.CW1/D1 are alleged
  to be acknowledged by one Sh. Shanker, who was allegedly working for the
  accused. Accused gave suggestion that Sh. Shanker was son of one Sh.
  Rajinder, who was proprietor of M/s. Krishna Fab. CW1 deposed that he is
  proprietor of M/s. Krishna Fab since 1998. He is also proprietor of M/s. M. K.
  Enterprises i.e. complainant herein.     He deposed that he had supplied
  goods to the accused on 15/04/2002 vide bill no. 1171 for Rs.83,728/- and
  alleged that cheque dated 09/04/2003 for that amount was also dishonored.
  He again deposed that he supplied material to the accused vide another bill
  no. 1172 dated 02/05/2002 for Rs.59,922/- and a cheque dated 08/04/2003
  was given to him in respect of this bill. He further admitted that bill payment
  was to be made within 30 days from supply. He deposed that he was filing
  Income Tax return      in respect of M/s. Krishna Fab, in which he has
  mentioned the aforesaid transaction. He undertook to produce the same on
  next date, but did not produce the same before the court. It is improbable
  that a person shall keep on delivering material to the buyer despite the fact
  that the cheques given by such buyer are being bounced again and again. It



CC no.4853/07                                                          Page  6/7
   is also doubtful scenario where cheque is being accepted and presented
  after huge gap of time. At one time, such cheque was allegedly accepted
  after one year. On another occasion, cheque was accepted after around
  eleven months. All these delivers were made in April and May of 2002, when
  as per allegation of the complainant, accused was already under liability to
  make payment of other purchases made by him. The cheque in question is
  dated 28/12/2002, but was presented in May 2003. This is not a normal
  scenario of any business transaction.
</p><p id="p_17">13.   Therefore, I find that complainant has failed to establish a clear cut
  picture of liability of the accused by establishing the fact that there were
  actually two separate transactions for a consideration amount of Rs.72,684/-,
