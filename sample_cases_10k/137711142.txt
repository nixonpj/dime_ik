AND 227 OF THE CONSTITUTION OF INDIA PRAYING THAT IN
THE PUBLIC INTEREST OF THE PETITIONERS, DIRECT
RESPONDENT NOS.1 TO 3 HEREIN TO RELEASE/PAY TO
THE PETITIONERS IMMEDIATELY THE PRICE TOWARDS THE

       THIS WRIT PETITION COMING ON FOR DICTATING
ORDERS THIS DAY, CHIEF JUSTICE MADE THE FOLLOWING:
                                      10



                                  ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">          The submissions of the learned counsel appearing for the

petitioners were heard on the earlier date.
</p>
<p id="p_2">          2.     The petitioners in this petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1">Article 226</a> of the

Constitution of India are farmers. According to their contention,

they supplied paddy bags to the fourth respondent.               On 11th

February 2014, an order was passed under Section 14 of the

Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and

<a href="/doc/198257891/" id="a_2">Enforcement of Security Interest Act</a>, 2002 (for short 'the

<a href="/doc/52229129/" id="a_3">SARFAESI Act</a>') directing possession to be taken of the secured

assets of the fourth respondent.          The third respondent -Bank

seized the industry of the fourth respondent and took physical

possession of the industry as well as the paddy bags. The prayer

in this petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_4">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India is that

the first to third respondents should be directed to release/pay to

the petitioners the price of the paddy bags. The second prayer is

to direct the respondents to follow the guidelines and directions

issued in a decision of the Allahabad High Court in the case of

<a href="/doc/141446058/" id="a_5">RASHTRIYA KISAN MAZDOOR SANGATHAN (REGD.) THRU

CONVENOR vs STATE OF U.P. AND</a> 2 OTHERS1. It is pointed

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">1</span>
    PIL No. 29523 of 2014
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                  11</span>



out that the decision of the Allahabad High Court has been

confirmed by the Apex Court by the order dated 13th October

2014.
</p>
<p id="p_3">        3.   There are objections filed by the third respondent -

Bank. The first contention therein is that an alternative remedy is

available.   It is stated that the fourth respondent was enjoying

credit facilities from the third respondent -Bank. It is contended

that the rice/paddy supplied by the petitioners was pledged with

the third respondent -Bank. A reference is made to the

proceedings filed before the Debt Recovery Tribunal. An order

was passed under <a href="/doc/57488768/" id="a_6">Section 14</a> of the SARFAESI Act for taking

possession of the mortgaged factory, land and building and other

assets of the fourth respondent. It is pointed out that the assets

were disposed of in public auction and the sale proceeds have

been credited to the loan account of the fourth respondent. It is

pointed out that the petitioners have no claim on the secured

assets in the form of stock of rice pledged to the Bank in 2009. It

is further pointed out that the petitioners cannot claim the price of

rice which was sold by them in December 2013 and December

2014 to the fourth respondent.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                   12</span><p id="p_4">



</p><p id="p_5">      4.     The submission of the learned counsel appearing for

the petitioners is based on the aforesaid decision of the Allahabad

High Court. He has taken us through the relevant part of the

findings recorded by the Allahabad High Court which are

confirmed by the Apex Court by summarily dismissing the Special

Leave Petition. In this petition, a contention is raised that the total

value of paddy stored by the petitioners and other farmers with the

fourth respondent is worth about Rs.4,40,00,000/-. He invited our

attention to the observations made by the Allahabad High Court

which are on page 113 of the said judgment.
</p>
<p id="p_6">
</p><p id="p_7">      5.     We have considered the submissions.               In the

objections filed by the third respondent, reliance was placed on

the order passed by the Competent Authority under <a href="/doc/57488768/" id="a_7">Section 14</a> of

the SARFAESI Act. It records that the possession of the

mortgaged factory, land and building along with other secured

assets was taken by the said bank. In fact, the inventory report

annexed as Annexure-C to the writ petition is relied upon. The

inventory is of 20th November 2015. It is further stated in the

objections that the secured assets were disposed of by a public

auction on 29th November 2017.         In fact, the third respondent

relied upon the stock of Sona Brown Rice pledged and deposit of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                 13</span>



warehouse receipts issued between 24th November 2008 and 6th

December 2008. The pledged rice was disposed of by the third

respondent and the sale proceeds have been credited to the loan

account of the fourth respondent.
</p>
<p id="p_8">
</p><p id="p_9">      6.    Thus, the position which emerges is that the power

was exercised under <a href="/doc/57488768/" id="a_8">Section 14</a> by the Magistrate for taking over

possession of the secured assets. The paddy which was seized

has been disposed of by the third respondent and the amount is

credited to the overdue account of the fourth respondent.


</p><p id="p_10">      7.    We fail to understand as to how the Bank is expected

to pay the price of paddy supplied by the petitioners to the fourth

respondent. The action under <a href="/doc/152603276/" id="a_9">Section 13</a> and the direction of the

Magistrate under <a href="/doc/57488768/" id="a_10">Section 14</a> of the SARFAESI Act have not been

questioned by the petitioners. The remedy of the petitioners and

similarly placed persons is against the fourth respondent for

recovery of the price of paddy and by no stretch of imagination,

any direction can be issued against the Bank.


</p><p id="p_11">      8.    Relying upon the decision of the Allahabad High

Court, the learned counsel appearing for the petitioners submits
