                                         For Respondents       : Mr.S.Sureshkumar, GA


                                                      ORDER
</pre>

<p id="p_1">                            The petitioner herein was charged for gross neglect of duty in having

                      transferred the case registered in Coimbatore City B-1 Bazaar Police Station

                      in Cr.No.727/98 to the Inspector of Police, Podanur Police Station after

                      commencing investigation on 28.05.1988 after a delay of 7 months, after

                      completion of investigation in the above cases. On failure to handover the

                      properties in time, the Enquiry Officer had found the charges, owing to

                      which the petitioner was imposed with a punishment of stoppage of

                      increment for a period of one year without cumulative effect.




</p><p id="p_2">                            2. The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the

                      authorities have failed to proceed against the actual Investigation Officers

                      and that the petitioner herein had taken up the investigation only after the

                      predecessors had registered the case. According to the learned counsel, the

                      delay in transferring the investigation and handing over the material

                      evidences, cannot be imputed on the petitioner herein and as such, the

                      proceeding itself is vitiated. The learned counsel would also submit that in

                      view of this, the petitioner's promotion to the post of Additional

                     Superintendent of Police, has been deprived of and therefore, the

                     punishment is liable to be set aside.
</p>
<p id="p_3">


</p><p id="p_4">                               3. The learned Government Advocate, by placing reliance on the

                     averments made in the Counter affidavit stated that there was a gross

                     neglect of duty on the part of the petitioner in transferring the case to the

                     Coimbatore City Police Station, after a delay of 7 months from the

                     completion of investigation and also the failure to handover the properties

                     in time, has facilitated the accused to get an order of acquittal. According

                     to the learned Government Advocate, in view of the lapses on the part of

                     the petitioner, and by taking into account the minor punishment imposed,

                     no interference is required to the impugned order.




</p><p id="p_5">                               4. I have given careful consideration to the submissions made by the

                     respective counsels.
</p>
<p id="p_6">


</p><p id="p_7">                               5. It is seen that the petitioner herein had taken up the investigation

                     of the case in Cr.No.727/88 on 27.05.1998. As per the findings of the Enquiry

                     Officer, he had conducted investigation on various dates from 27.05.1998 till

                     29.09.1998 and has also recovered various properties based on the

                     confession statement of the accused. After coming to the conclusion about

http://www.judis.nic.inthe   point of jurisdiction, he had chosen to transfer the CD file to Podanur
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                                        4</span>

                  Police Station, which came to be received by the then Inspector of Police,

                  Podanur Police Station on 25.04.1989. After subsequent investigation, the

                  charge sheet came to be filed only on 22.05.1992. The Trial Court, while

                  acquitting the accused, had observed that there was a neglect of duty on

                  the part of the petitioner herein in transferring the case, after

                  commencement of investigation, with a delay of nearly 7 months. The Trial

                  Court had also observed that the failure to handover the properties seized

                  by the petitioner herein in a proper manner, would go to the benefit of the

                  accused and thereby, had acquitted the petitioner herein. It cannot be

                  stated that the petitioner's predecessors alone are responsible for the delay.

                  From the findings of the Enquiry Officer, it is seen that the investigation was

                  taken up by the petitioner herein on 27.05.1988 and had the investigation

                  been transferred immediately, the decision of the Trial Court may have

                  been otherwise.

<p id="p_8">


</p><p id="p_9">                           6. Nevertheless, the petitioner herein was dealt with charges under

                  Rule 17(a) of the Tamilnadu Civil Services (Discipline &amp; Appeal) Rules and

                  has been imposed with a minor punishment. Since the findings of the

                  Enquiry Officer reveals that there was a neglect of duty and also taking into

                  account that the punishment can be termed as proportionate to the

                  charges, I did not find any reason to interfere with the punishment
