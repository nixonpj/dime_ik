                  ORAL ORDER</pre>

<p id="p_1">11   11-11-2014                 Heard the counsel for the parties.

</p><p id="p_2">                                The petitioners, who are father and son respectively

                  as amongst themselves, have challenged the order dated

                  10.06.2008 passed by the learned Judicial Magistrate 1st Class,

                  Biharsharif at Nalanda in connection with Complaint Case No.

                  1261(C)/2008, whereby cognizance has been taken under <a href="/doc/1317063/" id="a_1">Sections

                  465</a>, <a href="/doc/1466184/" id="a_2">471</a>, <a href="/doc/756306/" id="a_3">474</a> and <a href="/doc/555306/" id="a_4">504</a> of the Indian Penal Code.

</p><p id="p_3">                                The dispute is with respect to Plot Nos. 1206 &amp; 1204,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1"> Patna High Court Cr.Misc. No.39432 of 2011 (11) dt.11-11-2014</span>

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                           2/5</span>




             measuring an area of 2 decimals and 5.1/2 decimals of land in

             Nalanda district. The opposite party no. 2 claims to have

             purchased the said property from one Amresh Kumar Hansh, but

             the petitioners are alleged to have been creating hindrance in the

             peaceful enjoyment of the said property. The further allegation in

             the complaint is that by using a forged document, namely, the

             compromise decree in a title suit, namely, Title Suit No. 193/59,

             the petitioners have been creating disturbance in the peaceful

             enjoyment of the said property which was rightfully vended to the

             complainant.
</p>
<p id="p_4">                              Learned counsel for the petitioners draws the

             attention of this Court to Annexure-2, an order passed by this

             Court way back in the year 2010 in Cr. Misc. No. 20628 of 2008.

             The complainant-opposite party no. 2 had earlier also preferred a

             complaint vide Complaint Case No. 950(C) of 2004 for offences

             under <a href="/doc/752609/" id="a_5">Sections 385</a> and <a href="/doc/1101188/" id="a_6">379</a> of the Indian Penal Code. In the

             aforesaid complaint also, the complainant had raised doubt about

             the genuineness of the compromise decree in Title Suit No.

             193/59.
</p>
<p id="p_5">                              A Bench of this Court called for the original decree

             and, after perusing the same, found that there was no discrepancy

             with regard to the originality of the decree and, by no stretch of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3"> Patna High Court Cr.Misc. No.39432 of 2011 (11) dt.11-11-2014</span>

             imagination, could it be said to be a false document. The same

             order (Annexure-2) reveals the fact that Plot Nos. 1204 &amp; 1206

             were acquired by the Railways in LA Case No. 20 of 1960-61,

             which stood in the name of Guru Adhin Prasad Verma, father of

             the petitioner no. 1. The petitioners, on having come to know

             about such acquisition by the Railways, left pursuing the matter

             under 145 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_7">Cr.P.C</a>. proceedings. The cognizance taking order,

             which was passed in Complaint Case No. 950(C)/2004 referred to

             above, was, therefore, quashed vide order dated 22.03.2010

             (Annexure-2).
</p>
<p id="p_6">                              The dispute in the present complaint also appears to

             be the same. The entire allegation is based on the presupposition

             that the compromise decree is a fake one and that the petitioners

             have taken advantage of it in order to defeat the claim of the

             complainant, who is stated to have purchased the aforesaid

             property.
</p>
<p id="p_7">                              The petitioners further state that times without

             number, they have been harassed by the complainant-opposite

             party no. 2 for the purposes of putting some kind of pressure on

             them so as to accept the demands of the complainant.

</p><p id="p_8">                              Learned counsel appearing for the complainant-

             opposite party no.2, however, has expressed concern over the way
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5"> Patna High Court Cr.Misc. No.39432 of 2011 (11) dt.11-11-2014</span>

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                           4/5</span>




             in which his rightful claim upon the property has been sought to

             be reversed by the clever strategy of the petitioners. However, no

             proof of such act on the part of the petitioners could be

             demonstrated by the counsel for the complainant-opposite party 2.

             In the last, the learned counsel appearing for the opposite party no.

             2 stated that in the interest of justice, the petitioners be directed to

             appear in the title suit, which has been preferred by him and which

             has been numbered as Title Suit No. 149 of 2009, in which the

             petitioners have been impleaded as defendants no. 4 &amp; 5.

</p><p id="p_9">                              It is needless to state that if the petitioners, who are

             impleaded as the defendants and not appearing in the title suit and,

             in their absence, if the complainant-opposite party no. 2 makes out

             a case, an ex parte decree could be passed by the court below. No

             such order can be passed in this proceeding directing the

             petitioners to appear in the title suit preferred by the complainant-

             opposite party no. 2.
</p>
<p id="p_10">                              In any view of the matter, the present case appears to

             be a reiteration of the earlier claim/allegation by the complainant-

             opposite party no. 2 with respect to the plots of land in question

             which, according to him, is a purchased property whereas the

             petitioners have lost their interest in such land as the property stands

             acquired by the Railways.

</p><p id="p_12">                                        Considering the above mentioned facts, the order

                       taking cognizance dated 10.06.2008 passed in Complaint Case No.

                       1261(c)/2008 is held to be not fit to be sustainable in the eyes of

                       law. The same is quashed.
