(BY SRI.CHAITANYAKUMAR C.M., ADVOCATE)

     THIS CRIMINAL PETITION IS FILED UNDER SECTION 482
OF CR.P.C. PRAYING TO QUASH THE PROCEEDINGS IN
P.C.No.59/2012 (C.C.No.250/2012) PENDING ON THE FILE OF
THE LEARNED CIVIL JUDGE (JR. DN.) &amp; JMFC AT SHORAPUR,
IN THE INTEREST OF JUSTICE AND EQUITY.

     THIS PETITION IS COMING ON FOR HEARING, THIS DAY,
THE COURT MADE THE FOLLOWING :

                            ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">      This petition is filed under the provisions of <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_1">Section

482</a>    of   Cr.P.C.,   to    quash    the   proceedings     in

C.C.No.250/2012 (PC No.59/2012) on the file of the Civil

Judge (Jr.Dn) &amp; JMFC, Shorapur.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">2.     Petitioners are the accused in the above private

complaint filed by the respondents.
</p>
<p id="p_4">
</p><p id="p_5">      In the complaint filed by the respondent it is alleged

that he is the owner of the land bearing Sy.No.53/A

measuring 1 acre 36 guntas of Malahalli village.


</p><p id="p_6">3.    The petitioners conspired and fabricated documents

right from the initial stage of issue of 4(1) notification and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                3</span>




6(1) notification.   After passing of the award by the

petitioner No.1, and after preparing of cheques, the Village

Accountant has to identify the complainant's signature in

payment register maintained in the office of petitioner No.1.

Instead the Village Accountant accused No.5-K.R.Hibbare

has identified the beneficiaries and has signed as witness.

The complainant thereafter produced some documents and

requested the trial Court to issue summons to the

petitioners and other accused and to take cognizance for the

offence punishable under <a href="/doc/677888/" id="a_2">Sections 191</a>, <a href="/doc/1905297/" id="a_3">192</a>, <a href="/doc/814524/" id="a_4">196</a>, <a href="/doc/943588/" id="a_5">200</a>, <a href="/doc/1306824/" id="a_6">415</a>,

</p>
<p id="p_7">
</p><p id="p_8">4.   Learned Civil Judge (Jr.Dn) &amp; JMFC, Shorapur, after

recording the sworn statement of the complainant has taken

cognizance of the case and issued process to the petitioners

and other accused.     The petitioners therefore filed this

petition to quash the proceedings order dated 17.07.2012

passed by the learned Civil Judge &amp; JMFC, Shorapur.


</p><p id="p_9">5.   Learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that the

respondent-complainant    is   questioning   legality   of   the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                               4</span>




acquisition   proceedings,    even     after   receiving        the

compensation awarded by the Land Acquisition Officer. The

complainant and other beneficiaries filed false complaint

against the petitioners alleging that they have committed

fraud and fabricated documents.      It is further submitted

that the first petitioner was retired Asst. Commissioner. He

worked as Special Land Acquisition Officer till 16.04.2008

and he was relieved and cheques were prepared on

16.04.2008    subsequently   cheques    were   issued      to   all

beneficiaries as per revenue records by the successor of first

petitioner. The petitioners 2 to 4 who are accused Nos.2 to

4 are working as Executive Engineers respectively. Out of

them accused No.2 worked as Executive Engineer from

10.07.2006 to 31.12.2008 and submitted land acquisition

proceedings to SLAO.         Petitioner No.3-James Vincent

worked as Assistant Executive Engineer and sent proposal

for land acquisition as Executive Engineer. He also worked

from 01.10.2003 to 01.03.2008 at Shorapur. Accused No.4

worked from 11.02.2004 to 31.07.2011. They have no role in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                5</span>




payment of compensation. They have discharged their duty

as per instructions of the superior officers.


</p><p id="p_10">6.    It is further submitted that based on the identification

of the beneficiaries by the Village Accountant, the proposals

have been submitted to the Chief Accountant Officer, KBJNL

at Bagalkot, and after verification of the same, the cheques

have been sent to the Land Acquisition Officer and the Land

Acquisition Officer in turn disbursed the cheques to the

beneficiaries.
</p>
<p id="p_11">
</p><p id="p_12">7.    Learned counsel for the petitioners further submitted

that there is no allegation against the petitioners and that

the beneficiaries have not received the         compensation

amount. In fact even after receiving the compensation from

the Government they are enjoying the property, as the land

was not utilized for the purpose for which it was acquired.

Therefore the respondent-complainant cannot question the

acquisition proceedings even if the land is not utilized for

the purpose for which it was acquired.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                 6</span><p id="p_13">




</p><p id="p_14">8.    Learned   counsel   for       the   respondent-complainant

submitted that though the land was acquired for formation

of CD drain, the same was not utilized for the said purpose.

Still the complainant is cultivating the land.       He has not

submitted any application before the LAO or Civil Court

seeking enhancement of compensation, as the matter was

settled on the basis of one time settlement.


</p><p id="p_15">9.    Learned counsel for the respondent further submitted

that some of the beneficiaries were wrongly identified by

accused No.5, as if the beneficiaries are the same persons

entitled for compensation as per the award.


</p><p id="p_16">10.   It is therefore clear from the averments of the

complaint and sworn statement of the complainant that at

the time of disbursement of amount by way of cheques,

accused Nos.5 and 7 alleged to have played mischief and

without the knowledge of the beneficiaries, though cheques

were credited to some banks they were drawn and amounts

were withdrawn by the persons other than the beneficiaries

with the collusion of Branch Manager of Bank without
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                7</span>




proper   identification.    Recently   the   complainant    had

submitted an application under <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_13">RTI Act</a> to furnish the name

of the Bank to which Bank the cheques of the beneficiaries

were credited, but the Department has not furnished the

details of the name of the Bank to which the cheques of the

beneficiaries were deposited or credited, so as to know the

actual fraud and the persons responsible for not paying the

compensation to the actual beneficiaries. Thus according to

the respondent-complainant, at the time of disbursement of

the payment of compensation, the Officers conspired and

not   paid   compensation    amount     to   the   beneficiaries.

Admittedly there was no dispute with regard to acquisition

of the property and the preparation of the list of the

beneficiaries. It is alleged that officials committed fraud only

at the time of disbursement of the cheques to the

beneficiaries for which the first petitioner-accused No.1 is in

no way responsible, since he was promoted as Asst.

Commissioner and relieved from duty on 16.04.2008 and

thereafter cheques have been prepared on 16.04.2008

onwards. The petitioners 2 to 4 have no way concerned to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                               8</span>




payment of compensation to the beneficiaries.        Accused

No.3-James Vincent retired by 01.03.2008, i.e., even before

preparation of the cheques. Accused Nos.2 and 4 prepared

proceedings till the notification was issued under 6(1) of the

<a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_14">Land Acquisition Act</a>. Final notification was issued in this

case on 12.07.2007. After that they have nothing to do with

the further Land Acquisition Proceedings and disbursement

of the compensation to the beneficiaries. As there is specific

allegation only against accused Nos.5 and 7 and Bank

Officers in disbursement of the compensation to the

fictitious petitioners other than the beneficiaries and as

petitioners   are   in   no   way    concerned     with   the

disbursement of the compensation to the beneficiaries.

The allegations made against these petitioners are vague

and do not prima facie constitute any offence or make out

any case against the petitioners. The proceedings against

the petitioners may amount to the abuse or the process of

the Court and no useful purpose would be served by

continuing the proceedings.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                 9</span><p id="p_17">




</p><p id="p_18">11.   In view of the above facts and circumstances the

proceedings initiated against the petitioners are liable to

be quashed under the provisions of <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_15">Section 482</a> of Cr.P.C.

Accordingly the petition filed by the petitioners are allowed,

all   further   proceedings   against   these    petitioners    in

C.C.No.250/12 (PC No.59/12) are hereby quashed.                The

trial Court shall proceed against other accused for the

offence alleged against them.
