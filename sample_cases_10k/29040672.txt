                           L.P.A. No. 251 of 2014

The State of Jharkhand &amp; Ors.   ...            ...            Appellants
                           Versus
Kaushalya Devi                         ...   ...          Respondent

08/Dated 11 July, 2017
</p><p id="p_6">1.     Counsel appearing for the appellants has argued out the case at length.
</p><p id="p_7">2.     Nobody appears on behalf of the respondent.
</p><p id="p_8">3.     Counsel appearing for the appellants submitted that this matter is with
respect to compassionate appointment and as the husband of the respondent
(original petitioner) was not regularised in the services and he never worked as
a regular employee in the jail, his widow (respondent herein) cannot get
compassionate appointment. It is further submitted by the counsel appearing
for the appellants that the husband of the respondent, an adhoc employee
since 1985, was working as a warden in the jail.
</p><p id="p_9">4.     We, therefore, direct the appellants State to file an affidavit of the
Inspector General (Prison) before this Court by the next date of hearing
pointing out as to how many adhoc/daily wagers are working in the jails across
the State of Jharkhand. A Jail-wise data in this respect will be furnished
forthwith along with the name of such employees and nature of work done by
them. This data is essential taking into consideration the very fact that almost
no administrative control can be exercised upon such adhoc employees and
even their dismissal from service is also of no consequence.
</p><p id="p_10">5.     A jail-wise data will also be furnished with respect to the sanctioned
strength of employees in all the jails of this State, i.e. the total vacancy and the
posts already filled up.
</p><p id="p_11">6.     We would also like to know whether appointment of adhoc employees or
daily wagers are made in a routine manner in the jails keeping the vacancies
as they are, as appointment of adhoc employees has direct effect on the
security inside the jail and in a number of occasions, jail inmates were found in
possession of incriminating articles on raids conducted by the high ranking
officers of the concerned department.

<p id="p_12">       7.    As nobody appears on behalf of the respondent and as the aforesaid
       facts are to be brought on record, this matter is adjourned to be listed on 28th
       August, 2017.
