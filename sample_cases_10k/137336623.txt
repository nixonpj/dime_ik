<p id="p_1">1.            By   this   order   I   shall   dispose   off   the   appeal   filed   by   the 

   appellant challenging the judgment dt. 17.01.13 and order on sentence dt. 

   22.01.13,   whereby   appellant   was   convicted   for   having   committed   an 

   offence u/s. 138 <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_1">NI Act</a>.

Crl. (A) No. 35/13                     Page 1 of 11     Surinder Grover Vs. Jeevan Gupta
   are that the complainant had given Rs. 4,40,000/­ to the accused as loan, 

  in acknowledgment of which accused issued three cheques for the return 

  of the loan amount in three installments.     Two cheques of Rs.20,000/­ 

  each   were   dishonoured   on   grounds   of   Funds   Insufficient,   regarding 

  which   legal   notice   was   given   by   registered   AD   and  UPC.     The   legal 

  notice   was   not   replied   and   so   the   complaint   was   filed.     A   separate 

  complaint for dishonour of the cheque of Rs 4,00,000/ was filed. After 

  the   trial,   Ld.   Trial   Court   concluded   that   appellant   had   committed   an 

  offence punishable u/s. 138 <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_2">NI Act</a> and convicted and sentenced him for 

  the same, which judgment and order has been challenged by him inter­

  alia on following grounds:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">              ●   Ld. Trial Court did not consider that the complaint was silent 

                  on   the   liability   part   and   no   contractual   liability   has   been 

                  proved.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">              ●   The cheque was issued as a security and not for any liability.

              ●   The   legal   notice   does   not   bear   any   date   and   therefore,   is 

                  defective.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">              ●   The appellant had admitted the liability of Rs.2,31,400/­ and 

                  sum   amount   of   kachhi   committee,   no   amount   of   Rs.

                  4,40,000/­, however, was due.</blockquote><p id="p_3">

</p><p id="p_4">              ●   The loan was taken by brother of the appellant Sanjay Arora

                     from   the   complainant,   however,   to   create   pressure   the 

                    respondent filled the name of appellant, in the cheques.  

                ●   Some   loan   transactions   between   one   Sanjay   Arora   and 

                    complainant have been proved to show that the respondent is 

                    in the business of money lending, which is illegal in absence 

                    of a valid licence.  The transaction as such was hit by <a href="/doc/1625889/" id="a_3">section 

                    23</a> of Indian Contract Act.
</p>
<p id="p_5">                ●   The respondent has not been able to account for the money, 

                    from which he gave loan to the appellant.
</p>
<p id="p_6">3.              Argument heard.  Record perused.
</p>
<p id="p_7">4.              It  was  argued  by  Ld. Counsel  for the appellant  that  there is 

     nothing  stated   in  the complaint  or in the evidence of the complainant 

     regarding the transaction for which the cheque was issued.   The fact of 

     the matter is that the complainant mentioned that the cheque was issued 

     for   valuable   consideration   and   thereafter   in   the   cross­examination   the 

     complainant explained that he had given a loan of Rs.4,40,000/­ to the 

     accused.   It was for the return of this money that the appellant issued 

     three cheques, one of which is the subject matter of present appeal.  



</p><p id="p_8">5.              Ld.   Counsel   for   the   respondent   has   relied   upon   several 

     judgments wherein  Hon'ble Supreme Court and High courts have held 


Crl. (A) No. 35/13                      Page 3 of 11     Surinder Grover Vs. Jeevan Gupta
      that the issuance of cheque on which the drawer admits his signatures, 

     presupposes   the   existence   of  a   legal   liability   for   which   the   cheque   is 

     presumed to have been issued, unless rebutted by the drawer in trial. The 

     judgments   relied   upon   by   the   Counsel   are  (2010)   11   SCC   441, 

     Rangappa Vs. Sri Mohan; AIR 2004 SC 408, Goa Plast (Pvt. ) Ltd. 

     Vs. Chico Ursula D' Souza; AIR 2007 Madras 284 V. Thankgaraj Vs.

     plaintiff   did   not   adduce   sufficient   evidence   to   prove   passing   of 

     consideration   did   not   in   any   way   relieve   defendants   from   burden   of

     blank   and   was   filled   in   by   the   complainant,   the  Hon'ble   Kerala   High 


Crl. (A) No. 35/13                        Page 4 of 11      Surinder Grover Vs. Jeevan Gupta
      Court held  in  2007 (1) CCC 220 (Kerala), Moideen Vs. Johny that if 

     the drawer hands over the cheque in blank to a person, he authorises that 

     person to fill in the same with necessary entries regarding the liability. 

     Similar was the finding of the Hon'ble Kerala High court in 2004 (1) JCC 

     (NI) 14, Lilly Kutti Vs. Lawrance. 
</p>
<p id="p_12">

</p><p id="p_13">7.               It was argued that the cheque was given as a security cheque 

     and not to fulfill any liability.  The Hon'ble Kernataka High court in 2007 

     (2) DCR 37, Umaswamy Vs. K.N. Ramanath, held that a cheque issued 

     as a security does not exonerate penal liability u/s. 138 of <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_5">NI Act</a>.  



</p><p id="p_14">8.               The   Counsel   for   the   accused   relied   upon   the   judgment   of 

     Hon'ble   Madras   High   Court   in  2001   DCR   648   titled   Angu 

     Parameshwari Textiles Vs. Sri Rajam and Co., wherein the Hon'ble 

     High Court said that the cheque amount was more than the due amount 

     on the date of the presentment and therefore, the case U/s. 138 <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_6">NI Act</a> 

     was   not   maintainable.     In   the   said   case   the   accused   had   proved   the 

     payments   made   by   him,   thus   reducing   the   payable   amount   from   the 

     cheque amount to the balance amount.  The appellant has not been able to 

     prove that he paid anything to the complainant.  He has relied upon the 



Crl. (A) No. 35/13                       Page 5 of 11     Surinder Grover Vs. Jeevan Gupta
      judgment   of   Hon'ble   Supreme    Court  in  Jolly   George  Varghese  and 

     Anr. Vs. The Bank of Cochin AIR 1980 SC 470,  which do not have 

     factual applicability.
</p>
<p id="p_15">

</p><p id="p_16">9.              The accused  in support  of his plea that  the complainant  is a 

     professional   money   lender   got   filed   affidavits   of   two   persons   namely 

     Sanjay Arora and Sumit Puri.  Sumit Puri never came to the court for his 

     cross­examination   and   therefore,   his   affidavit   is   of   no   help   to   the 

     appellant.     Sanjay   Arora   appeared   before   the   court.   There   was   a 

     confusion regarding the identity of this witness as he filed the affidavit in 

     the name of Sanjay Arora, signed the same as Sanjeev Arora, deposed as 

     Sanjeev Arora @ Sanjay Arora and produced two documents in which his 

     names were written as Sanjeev Arora and Sanjay Arora.  The witness in 

     his affidavit had stated that he had taken a loan from the respondent.  The 

     respondent, however, did not return him the cheque, which he had  given 

     him as a security.  He says that the accused had also taken the loan from 

     the respondent on similar basis, which he had to repay @  Rs.100/­ per 

     day till 100 days.  In support of his affidavit, he produced two documents 

     with some entries of payments allegedly made by him to the respondent 

     to return the loan amount.  In his cross­examination he admitted that the 

     accused did not take the loan in his presence and he did not return the 

Crl. (A) No. 35/13                      Page 6 of 11     Surinder Grover Vs. Jeevan Gupta
   loan to the respondent in his presence.  He says that he took the loan from 

  the   complainant   twice   and   the   cards   Ex.CW1/DX1   and   DX2   were 

  prepared for the said loan.  He said that once he had failed to repay the 

  loan amount and he had received a notice but at that time his father paid 

  the money to the complainant and compromised the matter.   He stated 

  that the complainant never filed any case against him.  



</p><p id="p_17">                The   Hon'ble   Karnataka   High   Court   in  Satyanarayan   vs 

  Sandeep Enterprises, (2004) 7 Karn LJ 541 held:
</p>
<p id="p_18">   "It is true that the complainant has made above admission (of not having 

  a   licence   to   run   money   lending  business),   but   there   is  nothing  in   his 

  evidence to show that in the course of his business as a money lender, he 

  has   lent/advanced   the   amount   to   the   petitioner/accused.   That   apart, 

  though examined himself as D.W.1,   petitioner/ accused has not stated 

  that   the   cheques   in   question   were   in   relation   to   any   money   lending 

  business   i.e.   the   cheque   issued   was   in   the   course   of   money­lending 

  business of respondent/accused...."
</p>
<p id="p_19">

  The judgment has direct applicability to the facts of the present case. The 

  appellant/accused said in his evidence (as DW2) that he took money from 

  the complainant but does not say that the accused was a money­lender or 

Crl. (A) No. 35/13                     Page 7 of 11     Surinder Grover Vs. Jeevan Gupta
   the lending of money to him on various dates was in the course of the 

  money  lending  business.  Further, he himself  says  in his  evidence  that 

  apart from the loan taken by him, he also owed money to the respondent 

  on   account   of   committee.   The   appellant   having   entered   into   several 

  transaction   with   respondent   and   having   not   maintained   any   pukka   or 

  kachcha record of the same, is not believable and also does not help him 

  in challenging the case of the respondent. The witness of the accused in 

  fact has said that he had once defaulted in paying the money due to the 

  complainant but the complainant did not file any case against him, once 

  his father paid the money to him. His testimony does not suggest that the 

  complainant can be considered an unfair businessman.



</p><p id="p_20">              The   evidence   of   this   witness,   if   believed   to   be   correct,   the 

  complainant   issues   cards   whenever   he  gives   loan  to   anybody   and   the 

  repayments are entered therein.   The appellant is claiming that he had 

  repaid   Rs.75,600/­   to   the   complainant   by   way   of   installments   of   Rs.

  2,200/­ per day but has not produced any document as has been produced 

  by   his   own   witness   DW­1.     He   admits   that   he   took   loan   from   the 

  complainant and if he is to be believed, he took Rs.2,12,500/­.  Again he 

  does not have any document to prove his oral averment, though his own 

  witness has produced documents to show that loan was taken and cards 


Crl. (A) No. 35/13                     Page 8 of 11      Surinder Grover Vs. Jeevan Gupta
   were   made.     Therefore,   his   plea   that   he   repaid   Rs.75,600/­   stands 

  falsified.  He admits that apart from Rs. 2,12,500/­ taken by him from the 

  complainant,   he   had   also   to   pay   Rs.61,500/­   to   the   complainant   with 

  reference   to   a   committee   being  run  by  the  complainant.    Now  this  is 

  admitted case of the appellant/accused that he used to take loan from the 

  complainant and he admits some liability on that account..  This is also 

  admitted that the cheques were issued in discharge of a liability.   The 

  accused did not maintain any record of the payments made by him to the 

  complainant and of the loan taken by him  from the complainant.

</p><p id="p_21">              In view of above, there is no reason why his oral statements 

  should be accepted as against the oral statement of the complainant, who 

  is  categorically  saying  that  accused  took  a loan of  Rs.4,40,000/­  from 

  him.     This   is   also   admitted   case   of   the   parties   that   the   appellant  had 

  offered a settlement @ Rs. 3,00,000/­in one installment.   If he did not 

  owe the complainant Rs.3,00,000/­ why he agreed to pay the same, has 

  not been clarified by him.  
</p>
<p id="p_22">

</p><p id="p_23">10.           Admitted case of the accused is that he owed some money to 

  the complainant.   He has not produced any document to show that he

  therefore, has failed to rebut the presumption that the complainant was

</p><p id="p_25">11.           It  was   argued   that  the  legal  notice  was  not  served  upon  the 

  accused.   The legal notice was sent by Registered post as well as UPC. 

  The registered letter was received back with report that the recipient was 

  out of station for some time.  The notice, however, was also sent by way 

  of UPC, which was not received back and therefore, it is to be presumed 

  that   same   was   served   upon   the   accused   as   the   appellant   has   not 

  challenged the address mentioned on the notice.  On this issue I shall rely 

  upon   judgment   of   Hon'ble   Supreme   Court   in  V.   Raja   Kumari   Vs. 

  P.Subharama Naidu &amp; Anr. 2004 (3) JCC NI 226, wherein the Hon'ble 

  Supreme Court has held that "....... the principle incorporated in <a href="/doc/1428703/" id="a_7">Section 

  27</a> of the General Clauses Act can profitably be imported in a case where 

  the sender has dispatched the notice by post with correct address written 

  on it.  Then it can be deemed to have been served on the sendee unless he 

  proves that it is not really served and that he was not responsible for such 

  non service.  Any other interpretation can lead to a very tenuous position 

  as the drawer of the cheque who is liable to pay the amount would resort 

  to   the   strategy   of   subterfuge   by   successfully   avoiding   the   notice." 

  Further,   the   Hon'ble   Supreme   Court   in  C.C.Alvi   Haji   Vs.   Palapetty 

  Muhammed's    matter, as relied on by the Trial Court has clearly laid 

Crl. (A) No. 35/13                  Page 10 of 11    Surinder Grover Vs. Jeevan Gupta
   down that where the notice is sent by post and the accused claims that he 

  did   not   receive   it   the   date   on   which   the   summons   are   served   can   be 

  considered as the date of service of notice and if he offers the payment 

  within 15 days thereafter, the complaint can be rejected.  Regarding the 

  non   mentioning   of   the   date   on   legal   notice,   the   notice   contains   the 

  particulars   of   the   cheque  and  is  supported  with  the  postal  receipts  by 

  which it was sent, it is therefore, immaterial as to on which date it was 

  typed.  The date of postal circulation is relevant and not the date of notice 

  for the purpose of computation of limitation.
