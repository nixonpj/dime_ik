     IN THE COURT OF SH. DHARMESH SHARMA : ADDITIONAL

Sh. Gopal Singh, Advocate for Respondent.
</p>
<p id="p_3">O R D E R:-
</p>

<p id="p_4">          This order shall decide a revision petition preferred by the
petitioners/revisionists against an order dated 11.10.2007 whereby
Sh. B.R. Bansal Ld. Metropolitan Magistrate, Delhi framed the charge
against the accused persons u/s 323/379/34 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_1">IPC</a> in complaint case
no. 5137/06 title Satya Prakash vs. Rajender and another.
</p><p id="p_5">          This is an unfortunate case where father has filed a
complaint against his son and daughter in law, petitioner/ revisionist
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                    2</span>

before this Court, on the allegation that he is the owner of premises
bearing no. B-79, Karampura, New Delhi and his son and his wife are
unauthorizedly occupying the rear portion of the said premises; that
complainant and his wife have been assaulted several times by the
accused son and daughter in law so much so that they were even
deprived of the facility of use of toilet and the bathroom in their own
house; that the complainant has been constantly abused and insulted
by the accused persons and threatened with dire consequences on
many occasions. It is also the case of the complainant that accused
snatched away jewelery worth Rs. 10 lakhs besides cash of
Rs.55,000/- from him.
</p><p id="p_6">          Suffice to state that after considering the pre-summoning
evidence of the complainant, Ld. Metropolitan Magistrate was pleased
to take cognizance u/s 451/323/506/34 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_2">IPC</a> against the accused
persons vide order dated 23.04.2003 post summoning after recording
the evidence of the complainant, charge has been ordered to be
framed against the accused persons/petitioners u/s 323/379/34 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_3">IPC</a>.
</p><p id="p_7">          Sh. S.C. Sharma Ld. Counsel for the petitioners/revisionists
has urged that evidence of the complainant post summoning is
contradictory to his complaint Ex CW-1/4 in as much as he has stated
in his evidence that accused persons have committed theft of jewelery
items amounting of Rs.50,000/- and an electricity motor. He has also
urged that the allegation and evidence of the complainant regarding
beating at the hand of the accused son and daughter in law are bald
allegations without giving specific date or instances. It is thus urged
that the charge framed against the accused persons by the Ld.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                    3</span>

<p id="p_8">Metropolitan Magistrate cannot be sustained in law.
</p><p id="p_9">          I have heard the Ld. Counsel for the parties and I have also
perused the relevant record of the case including the trial court
record.
</p><p id="p_10">          I am afraid I do not find any merits in the submissions made
by the Ld. Counsel for the petitioner/revisionists. At this stage of the
case, on a bare perusal of the evidence of the complainant, there
appears a prima facie case to proceed against the accused son and
daughter in law u/s 323/379/34 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_4">IPC</a>. At this stage of case, the Court
cannot go into the probative value of the evidence or the
consistencies or inconsistencies in the evidence of CW-1.        There
appears to be no illegality, impropriety or perversity committed by the
Ld. Metropolitan Magistrate while passing impugned order dated
11.07.2007 and the impugned order is passed on fair appreciation of
facts and proposition of law.
</p><p id="p_11">          Needless to state that post charge, the accused persons
shall be having another opportunity to challenge the case of the
complainant and bring out weaknesses in his case, if any, and there is
no prejudice caused to them.
</p><p id="p_12">          In the said view of the matter the revision petition is
dismissed. Trial court record be sent back along with a copy of this
order. File be consigned to Record Room.

TODAY: ON 12.08.2009.                    ASJ-II, NORTH DISTRICT,
