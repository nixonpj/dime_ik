                                   AT JAMMU

CRMC No. 68/2013 &amp; IA Nos.01/2018 &amp; 83/2013
                                                        Date of order:28.09.2018

Rachpal Singh                          Vs.            State of J&amp;K and another
Coram:

       Hon'ble Mr. Justice Sanjay Kumar Gupta, Judge

Appearing counsel:
For Petitioner(s)  :       Mr. Rahul Pant, Advocate
For respondent (s) :       Mr. C. M. Koul, Sr. AAG

i)    Whether to be reported in
      Digest/Journal                   :      Yes/No.
ii)   Whether approved for reporting
      in Press/Media                   :      Yes/No.

1.    Through the instant writ petition filed under <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_1">Section 561-A</a> of the Code
      of Criminal Procedure (hereinafter for short, <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_2">Cr.P.C</a>), the petitioner seeks
      following relief:-
             "Quash the FIR No.30 of 2012 dated 27th March,
             2012 registered with Police Station,    Gangyal,
             Jammu for commission of offence under Section 188
             RPC and Section 13/14/16/21 J&amp;K Brick Kiln
             (Regulations) Act, 2010 and consequential
             investigation conducted so far."

2.    The petitioner claims to be the proprietor of Shiva Brick Kiln which is
      engaged in the manufacture of the bricks at Village Sikanderpur, Tehsil
      and District Jammu. It is stated that petitioner has been issued licence by
      the Licensing Authority for running the aforesaid Brick Kiln and the said
      license has been renewed upto 31.03.2013.
3.    Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that on 27 th March, 2012
      about 7.00 a.m., petitioner came to know that the bricks which were


CRMC No.68/2013                                                        Page 1 of 9
       being carried away by the purchasers after the purchase from the
      premises of the Brick Kiln, have been seized by Police at Police Station,
      Gangyal, Jammu. It is stated that on the same day i.e., 27th March, 2012
      an FIR No.30 of 2112 for commission of offence under Section 188 RPC
      and Section 13/14/16/21 of the J&amp;K Brick Kiln (Regulations), Act 2010,
      came to be registered by the Incharge Police Station, Gangyal. It is stated
      that entire facts of the aforesaid FIR were manipulated for ulterior
      motives, as it is impossible to have communication generated from the
      office of the Deputy Commissioner, Jammu more particularly, when the
      office time in the month of March is 10.00 a.m to 4.00 p.m. It is further
      stated that even before the commencement of the investigation and after
      the registration of FIR, the vehicle had been seized. It is further stated
      that inasmuch as the FIR is registered on 27th March, 2012, the bricks are
      seized on the same day in the morning and in the FIR the communication
      which forms the basis of the FIR shows that the Deputy Commissioner
      has alleged that the office has received report from the Legal Metrology
      Department about the examination of the Bricks.
4.    Learned counsel for the petitioner states that an application was filed
      before the Magistrate seeking status report in the FIR. It is stated that
      perusal of the status report submitted before the Magistrate would reveal
      that it is admitted by the Investigation Officer that after the registration
      of the FIR when investigation was entrusted to him, he seized the bricks
      and thereafter he seized 10 bricks each from the said vehicles for the
      purpose of their examination. It is stated that when the seizure of the
      bricks was made after the registration of the FIR, then it is not
      understandable as to how the District Magistrate in his communication
      has reported to the Police about his having already received the report
      from the Legal Metrology Department. Further, the report submitted
      before the Magistrate shows that the Investigating Officer has himself
      admitted that the case is non-cognizable in nature, but even then

CRMC No.68/2013                                                       Page 2 of 9
       investigation in FIR has not been closed so far. It is stated that even if the
      allegations leveled in the FIR are taken on their face value and accepted
      in their entirety, even then they do not constitute any cognizable offence
      justifying the registration of FIR and investigation by the Police Officer.
      It is further stated that there is legal bar in the J&amp;K Brick Kiln
      (Regulations) Act, 2010 to take cognizance of the offence under the said
      Act and offences under the said Act are non-cognizable. Therefore,
      respondent No. 2 has no jurisdiction to register the FIR and start the
      investigation as he is not the licensing authority. It is stated that
      admittedly Deputy Commissioner is the licensing authority and the
      cognizance of the offence under this Act can only be taken by the Court
      on a complaint made by the Deputy Commissioner.
5.    It is submitted that consignment of the bricks which has been purchased
      by the purchaser was given to him along with the bill and the said bill has
      been seized by the Investigating Officer and one copy of the bill was
      with the purchaser also, therefore, it is not understandable as to how the
      petitioner is being saddled with the liability under Section 16 of the J&amp;K
      Brick Kiln (Regulations) Act, 2010 when the purchaser was carrying the
      bricks along with the bills.
6.    Learned counsel for the petitioner further states that under Section 22 of
      the J&amp;K Brick Kiln (Regulations) Act 2010, the offence is non-
      cognizable as such, no FIR can be registered by the Police under <a href="/doc/1316937/" id="a_3">Section
      22</a>.
7.    It is further stated that malafide of the respondent No. 2 can be judged
      from the fact that on one communication of the Deputy Commissioner,
      Jammu, vehicles are seized and the respondent No. 2 himself comments
      that the offence is non-cognizable. In the said communication of the
      Deputy Commissioner, the Naka was laid, vehicles seized, drivers
      arrested. Consequently, the aforesaid communication is found to have
      been made the basis of registration of the FIR and seizure of the said

CRMC No.68/2013                                                         Page 3 of 9
       bricks for the purposes. It is stated that it is not understandable as to how
      the respondent No.2 has given his observations that the offence is not
      cognizable. This act of the respondents shows the malafide exercise of
      power for ulterior motives to harass the brick kiln owners.
8.    It is stated that offence under Section 188 RPC has been unfortunately
      saddled by the respondent No. 2 illegally as he has not even bothered to
      see the contents of Section 188 RPC.
9.    Learned counsel for the petitioner states that provisions of Section 188
      RPC have been invoked to deliberately register the FIR and to harass the
      petitioner.
10.   I have considered the rival contentions. I have also gone through the
      relevant law in this regard.
11.   From the perusal of FIR No.30/2012, it reveals that petitioner has been
      booked u/s sections 13/14/16/21 of the J&amp;K Brick Kiln (Regulations),
      Act 2010 and under Section 188 RPC.
12.   <a href="/doc/1326525/" id="a_4">Section 13</a> of The Jammu &amp; Kashmir Brick Kiln (Regulations), Act
      2010, deals with Fixation of Price of bricks by the Government for the
      whole State or for different areas thereof and different prices may be
      fixed for different kinds of bricks having regard to the weight, size and
      compressive strength of bricks. <a href="/doc/1326525/" id="a_5">Section 14</a> of the Act, specifies Quality
      of Bricks manufactured by the licenced kiln owner which shall conform
      to the standards set for such product by the Indian Bureau of Standards.
      <a href="/doc/1326525/" id="a_6">Section 16</a> deals with Sale Bill that every consignment of bricks whether
      carried by vehicles, carts or any other mode, shall invariably be
      accompanied by a valid sale bill as prescribed under law in force. <a href="/doc/1326525/" id="a_7">Section
      21</a> defines Penalties; that if any person contravenes or abets
      contravention of any of the provisions of this Act or the rules made
      thereunder, he shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which
      may extend to two years or with the fine which may extend to fifty
      thousand or with both.

CRMC No.68/2013                                                        Page 4 of 9
 13.   Section 22 of J&amp;K Brick Kiln (Regulations), Act 2010 reads as under:-
             "22. Cognizance of Offence.-
             No court shall take cognizance of any offence
             punishable under the Act except on the report in
             writing of the facts constituting such offence made by
             the licensing authority or any person duly authorized
             by the Government in this regard."

14.   From bare perusal of this section, it is clear that cognizance of offences
      under sections 13/14/16/21 of the J&amp;K Brick Kiln (Regulations), Act
      2010 can be taken by the Court on the report filed by the licensing
      authority or any other person duly authorized by the government in this
      behalf. But in present case, it is not so as no such report has been filed by
      licensing authority or any other person duly authorized by the
      government.
15.   Section 188 RPC reads as under:-
                  188. Disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant.--
                  Whoever, knowing that, by an order promulgated by a public servant
                  lawfully empowered to promulgate such order, he is directed to abstain
                  from a certain act, or to take certain order with certain property in his
                  possession or under his management, disobeys such direction;
                  shall if such disobedience causes or tends to cause obstruction,
                  annoyance or injury, or risk of obstruction, annoyance or injury, to any
                  person lawfully employed, be punished with imprisonment which may
                  extend to one year and shall also be liable to fine;
                  and if such disobedience causes or tends to cause danger to human life,
                  health or safety, or causes or tends to cause a riot or affray, shall be
                  punished with imprisonment which shall not be less than three months
                  but may extend to two years and shall also be liable to fine.
                  Explanation.--It is not necessary that the offender should intend to
                  produce harm, or contemplate his disobedience as likely to produce
                  harm. It is sufficient that he knows of the order which he disobeys, and
                  that his disobedience produces, or is likely to produce, harm.
                  Illustration An order is promulgated by a public servant lawfully



CRMC No.68/2013                                                               Page 5 of 9
                    empowered to promulgate such order, directing that a religious
                   procession shall not pass down a certain street. A knowingly disobeys
                   the order, and thereby causes danger of riot. A has committed the
                   offence defined in this section."
16.   Section 188 RPC thus has following essentials:-
             1.    That there must be an order promulgated by the public
                   servant;
             2.    That the public servant must have been fully empowered to
                   promulgate such order;
             3.    That the person having knowledge of such order and
                   directed by such order;

                   (a)      to abstain from certain act; or
                   (b)      to take certain order with certain property in his
                   possession or under his management, has disobeyed such
                   direction.

             4.    That such disobedience causes or intends to cause;

             (i)   Obstruction, annoyance or injury or risk of it, to any person
                   lawfully employed; or
             (ii) Danger to human life, health or safety
             (iii) A riot or affray.


17.   In present case, no such promulgation issued by the public servant has
      been place on record. Further, <a href="/doc/621703/" id="a_8">section 195</a> of Cr.P.C. reads as under:-
             "195. (1) No Court shall take cognizance-

             (a)     Prosecution for contempt of lawful authority of public
             servants.- Of any offence punishable under Sections 172 to 188 of the
             Ranbir Penal Code, except on a complaint in writing of public servant
             concerned, or of some other public servant to whom he is subordinate
             .
</pre><p id="p_1">             (b)     -----------------------
</p><p id="p_2">             This provision prescribes as an exception to general rule continued in
             <a href="/doc/686759/" id="a_9">section 190</a> Cr.p.c that any person can set criminal law in motion by
             making complaint; because it prohibits the court from taking
             cognizance of certain offences ( 172-188 RPC ) or otherwise even
             entertaining the complaint by court ,unless it is moved by specific
             authority. This bar is applicable to both cognizable and non-
             cognizable offences."

             1775, this Court held that the provisions of this Section cannot be evaded

             sections of <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_13">IPC</a>, though in truth and substance, the offence falls in a
             category mentioned in <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_14">Section 195Cr</a>.PC. Thus, cognizance of such an
             offence cannot be taken by mis-describing it or by putting a wrong label

             such general powers of the magistrate, and the general right of a person
             to move the court with a complaint to that extent curtailed. It is a well-
             recognised canon of interpretation that provision curbing the general
             jurisdiction of the court must normally receive strict interpretation
             unless the statute or the context requires otherwise." (Emphasis

             considered the nature of the provisions of <a href="/doc/621703/" id="a_21">Section 195</a> Cr.PC. In the said
             case, cognizance had been taken on the police report by the Magistrate
             and the appellant therein had been tried and convicted, though the
             concerned public servant, the Tahsildar had not filed any complaint. This
             Court held as under:

<blockquote id="blockquote_7">             "The cognizance of the case was therefore wrongly assumed by the court
             without the complaint in writing of the public servant, namely, the
             Tahsildar in this case. The trial was thus without jurisdiction ab initio
             and the conviction cannot be maintained. The appeal is, therefore,
             allowed and the conviction of the appellant and the sentence passed on
             him are set aside." (Emphasis added)
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_8">             25. Thus, in view of the above, the law can be summarized to the effect
             that there must be a complaint by the pubic servant whose lawful order
             has not been complied with. The complaint must be in writing. The
             provisions of <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_22">Section 195Cr</a>.PC are mandatory. Non-compliance of it
             would vitiate the prosecution and all other consequential orders. The

              Court cannot assume the cognizance of the case without suchcomplaint.
             In the absence of such a complaint, the trial and conviction will be void

<blockquote id="blockquote_9">             26. Learned counsel for the appellants have submitted that no charge
             could have been framed under <a href="/doc/1432790/" id="a_23">Section 188</a> IPC in the absence of a
             written complaint by the officer authorised for that purpose, the
             conviction under <a href="/doc/1432790/" id="a_24">Section 188</a> IPC is not sustainable. More so, it falsifies
             the very genesis of the case of the prosecution as the prohibitory orders
             had not been violated, no subsequent incident could occur. Thus, entire
             prosecution case falls.

<blockquote id="blockquote_10">             27. Undoubtedly, the law does not permit taking cognizance of any
             offence under <a href="/doc/1432790/" id="a_25">Section 188</a> IPC, unless there is a complaint in writing by
             the competent Public Servant. In the instant case, no such complaint had
             ever been filed. In such an eventuality and taking into account the settled
             legal principles in this regard, we are of the view that it was not
             permissible for the trial Court to frame a charge under <a href="/doc/1432790/" id="a_26">Section 188</a> IPC.
             However, we do not agree with the further submission that absence of a
             complaint under <a href="/doc/621703/" id="a_27">Section 195</a> Cr.PC falsifies the genesis of the
             prosecution's case and is fatal to the entire prosecution case. There is
             ample evidence on record to show that there was a prohibitory order;
             which had been issued by the competent officer one day before; it had
             been given due publicity and had been brought to the notice of the public
             at large; it has been violated as there is no denial even by the accused
             persons that there was no `Rasta Roko Andolan'. Unfortunately, the
             agitation which initially started peacefully turned ugly and violent when
             the public transport vehicles were subjected to attack and damage. In
             such an eventuality, we hold that in case the charges under <a href="/doc/1432790/" id="a_28">Section
             188</a> IPC are quashed, it would by no means have any bearing on the case
             of the prosecution, so far as the charges for other offences are
             concerned."

<p id="p_4">19.   In view of above law, it is quite clear that Court cannot take cognizance
