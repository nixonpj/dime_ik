           HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE ARUN BHANSALI
                           Judgment
24/10/2017

     These appeals by owner and driver of the vehicle are

directed against the judgment and awards dated 12.01.2000
                                 (2 of 7)


passed by the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Bikaner ('the

Tribunal'),   whereby   the   Tribunal       has   awarded       a    sum    of

Rs.59,500/-    to   claimants-Smt.         Ishar   Kanwar    &amp;       Anr.   and

Rs.46,000/- to Om Prakash and has exonerated the Insurance

Company from payment of compensation.
</p>
<p id="p_18">      Applications for compensation were filed by the legal

representatives of the Kishore Singh @ Kesu Singh i.e. Smt. Ishar

Kanwar and Lal Singh and injured Om Prakash, inter alia, with the

averments that on 25.03.1997, one Kesu Singh and Om Prakash

were travelling in Truck No.RJ-23-G-0476, which turned turtle on

account of rash and negligent driving by its driver, resulting in,

grievous injuries to Kesu Singh and Om Prakash, to which, Kesu

Singh succumbed. It was claimed that Kesu Singh was aged 60

years, was involved in agriculture and livestock operations and

earned Rs.3,000/- per month. Based on that, a compensation to

the tune of Rs.7,70,000/- was claimed; Om Prakash claimed

compensation to the tune of Rs.2,31,000/- towards the permanent

disablement suffered by him.
</p>
<p id="p_19">      Reply to the applications was filed by the owner, inter alia,

indicating that liability, if any, was of the Insurance Company.

</p><p id="p_20">      The Insurance Company filed its reply and disputed its

liability. It was indicated that the vehicle involved was a 'goods

vehicle' and violating the conditions of policy, the same was being

used for carrying passengers for hire and reward, for which, the

Insurance Company cannot be held liable. It was further indicated

that the policy issued was 'act only policy' and, therefore, on that

count, the Insurance Company cannot be held liable for making
                                 (3 of 7)


payment to gratuitous passengers.
</p>
<p id="p_21">     The Tribunal framed five issues. On behalf of the claimants,

three witnesses were examined and on behalf of non-claimants,

also three witnesses were examined.
</p>
<p id="p_22">     After hearing the parties, the Tribunal came to the conclusion

that the accident occurred on account of rash and negligent

driving by driver of the Truck Mahesh Kumar. While deciding the

issue pertaining to the liability of the Insurance Company, the

Tribunal came to the conclusion that the plea raised by the

claimants that the Truck in question was hired by Kesu Singh and

Om Prakash for the purpose of transportation of goods, was not

proved and, consequently, for the claimants travelling in the

vehicle   as   gratuitous   passenger,     exonerated   the   Insurance

Company on account of violation of policy conditions and after

assessing the compensation, awarded compensation amongst the

claimants as indicated hereinbfore.
</p>
<p id="p_23">     It is submitted by learned counsel for the appellants that the

Tribunal committed error in exonerating the Insurance Company.

It was submitted that it was proved on record that the claimant

Om Prakash was carrying his goods in the vehicle and was

travelling with his goods in the Truck and that the deceased Kesu

Singh was travelling in the Truck for getting delivery of Buffalo and

as both the persons were covered as owners of the goods, in view

of the provisions of <a href="/doc/87183818/" id="a_1">Section 147(b)(i)</a> of the Motor Vehicles Act,

1988 ('the Act'), the Insurance Company is liable for making

payment of amount of compensation. Further submissions were

made that a bare look at the Insurance Policy (Ex.-8) reveals that
                                (4 of 7)


the Insurance Company had charged premium of Rs.50/- for Non-

Fare Paying Passengers ('NFPP') and, therefore, even if the finding

as recorded by the Tribunal that Kesu Singh and Om Prakash were

NFPP, in view of the premium charged by the Insurance Company,

it was liable for making payment of amount of compensation and,

therefore, the award impugned deserves to be modified and the

Insurance Company be held liable.
</p>
<p id="p_24">       Learned counsel appearing for the respondent-Insurance

Company submitted that from the material available on record as

well as finding recorded by the Tribunal, it is apparent that the

plea raised in this regard is merely an after though, inasmuch as,

no such plea regarding Om Prakash travelling with his goods and

Kesu Singh travelling in the Truck for getting delivery of Buffalo

was taken and it was only in the reply filed by the owner that such

plea   was   taken,   which   cannot      be   countenanced.   Further

submissions were made that the charge of premium for NFPP

cannot saddle the Insurance Company with liability for the

gratuitous passengers tranvelling in the transport vehicle and,

therefore, finding recorded by the Tribunal in this regard does not

call for any interference.
</p>
<p id="p_25">       It was further submitted that even if it is held that on

account of charging premium for NFPP, the Insurance Company is

liable, the Insurance Company can be held liable for only one

passenger and not in both the cases.
</p>
<p id="p_26">       Reliance was placed on judgment of Gauhati High Court in

<a href="/doc/674267/" id="a_2">The New India Assurance Co. Ltd. v. B. Lalrosanga &amp; Anr</a>.: MAC

Appeal No.38/2010, decided on 25.03.2011.
</p><p id="p_27">                                   (5 of 7)


     I have considered the submissions made by learned counsel

for the parties and have perused the material available on record.

</p><p id="p_28">     The Tribunal after thoroughly scrutinizing the evidence

available on record as well as pleadings of the parties, came to the

conclusion that the deceased Kesu Singh as well as Om Prakash

were travelling in the vehicle as NFPP / gratuitous passengers and

the plea raised regarding carrying the goods in the vehicle or

travelling in the vehicle for getting delivery of Buffalo was merely

an after thought and was not proved.
</p>
<p id="p_29">     Learned counsel for the appellants could not point out any

perversity in the said finding and, therefore, the finding in this

regard does not call for any interference.

</p><p id="p_30">     A bare look at the policy produced as Ex.-8 indicates that the

Insurance Company charged premium of Rs.50/- for NFPP. This

Court in Future General India Ins. <a href="/doc/158559853/" id="a_3">Co. Ltd. v. Bhagwan Singh @

Bhanwar Singh &amp; Ors</a>.: S.B. Civil Misc. Appeal No.1155/2013,

decided on 01.10.2013, while dealing with the aspect of charging

premium for NFPP, while disagreeing with the view in the case of

B. Lalrosanga (supra) cited by learned counsel for the respondent-

Insurance Company, laid down as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">         "There is no dispute that the appellant-Insurance
         Company had recovered premium of Rs. 150/- for
         covering risk of two non-fare paying passengers. It is
         sought to be disputed by the appellant-Insurance
         Company that the said premium did not relate to the
         nature of passengers in whose status, the injured and
         deceased were travelling in the truck and therefore,
         the appellant-Insurance Company is not liable.
            A bare look at the IMT-37 quoted above would reveal
         that the said Indian Motor Tariff 37 provided that
         Company will Indemnify the insured against his legal
         liability in respect of death of or bodily injury to any
         employee, who is not a workman not being carried for
         hire or reward, any other person not being carried for
         hire or reward provided the person is charterer or
                                   (6 of 7)

         representative of the charterer of the truck and any
         other person directly connected with the journey in one
         form or other being carried in or upon or entering or
         mounting or alighting from any Motor Vehicle. The
         provision contained in (ii)(b) of the said IMT No.37 is
         quite sweeping in nature and takes into its sweep any
         other person directly connected with the journey or
         being carried in, entering, mounting, alighting from the
         motor vehicle and the same cannot be restricted in any
         manner.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">            Further Section 147(b)(i) of the Act mandates
         covering liability of death of or bodily injury to any
         person, including owner of the goods or his authorised
         representative carried in the vehicle w.e.f. 14.11.1994.
         Therefore, the premium under IMT-37, which indicates
         covering risk of charterer or representative of the
         charterer of the truck under clause (ii)(a) is wholly
         unnecessary and redundant. As such, the only
         interpretation which can be put to the later half of the
         above condition i.e. (ii)(b) would be that the appellant-
         Insurance Company undertook liability of the present
         nature. There cannot be any doubt that the deceased
         and the injured were passengers in the vehicle and
         were permitted to board the vehicle by the driver, who
         was incharge of the vehicle. There presence was not
         unauthorised and they were connected with the
         journey atleast upto the place of accident.
            The very fact that the appellant-Insurance Company
         decides to charge additional premium for non-fare
         paying passengers, they cannot get out of their liability
         with respect to such non-fare paying passengers taking
         resort to the restriction regarding carriage of persons
         in goods vehicle.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">           Learned counsel for the appellant tried to bring in
         several examples for indicating the persons, who would
         be covered by said clause (ii)(b) above, but all such
         examples already stand covered by the earlier part of
         the IMT-37 and the injured and deceased are very well
         covered under the said provision."</blockquote><p id="p_31">


</p><p id="p_32">     In view of the judgment of this Court in Bhagwan Singh

(supra), the finding of the Tribunal in ignorance of the fact that

premium of Rs.50/- was charged for NFPP, cannot be sustained

and the same is, therefore, reversed.
</p>
<p id="p_33">     There is substance in the submission made by learned

counsel for the respondent-Insurance Company that the Insurance

Company had charged premium for only one passenger and,

therefore, it cannot be saddled with liability of the two passengers.

Hon'ble Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/1633949/" id="a_4">National Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Anjana</a>
                                     (7 of 7)


Shyam &amp; Ors.: (2007) 7 SCC 445, laid down that in such a

situation the Insurance Company would be required to make

payment     to   the    claimant,   who        has     been    awarded     higher

compensation and as in the present case claimant-Ishar Kanwar

has been awarded higher compensation, the finding in her case

only shall stand set aside and the finding in this regard in the case

of Om Prakash would stand upheld.
</p>
<p id="p_34">      In view of the above discussion, SBCMA No.229/2000 filed

by   the   appellants    is   allowed.     The       finding   of   the   Tribunal

exonerating the Insurance Company is set aside and it is held that

the Insurance Company would be jointly and severally liable for

making payment of amount of compensation to the claimants.

</p><p id="p_35">      If any amount has been paid/deposited by the appellants to

the claimants in terms of the award and/or proviso to <a href="/doc/93665491/" id="a_5">Section

173(1)</a> of the Act, the said amount would be paid to the appellant

and if any amount is still due to the claimants, the said amount

would be paid to the claimants by the respondent-Insurance

Company within a period of six weeks from the date of this

judgment.
</p>
<p id="p_36">      SBCMA No.230/2000 shall stand dismissed.
