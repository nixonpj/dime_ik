               The   facts   of   the   present   suit   are   within   a   narrow

compass.  The defendants, in the Written Statement, have not denied

that  they  had  purchased the entire second floor with 100%  roof /

Delhi vide registered sale deed dated 18.07.2002.  The plaintiff has

alleged that after the execution of the aforesaid sale deed, one more

agreement   dated   18.07.2002   was   also   executed   in   between   the

plaintiff   and   the   defendants   whereby   Rs.   30,000/­   of   the   plaintiff

were retained by the defendants towards the payment of house tax,

electricity dues etc.  It has been further submitted by the plaintiff that

the   original   of   the   aforesaid   agreement   has   been   lost   and   he   has

given intimation of the same to SHO P.S. Vikas Puri and the copy of

of the house tax and further failed to return the aforesaid money to

the plaintiff and hence the present suit for recovery of Rs. 30,000/­

              Whereas on the other hand, by way of the written final

arguments filed on record, Ld. counsel for the defendants has argued

that according to the sale deed, it is the plaintiff, who is responsible

for   making   the   balance   payment   towards  house   tax.     It   has  been

further   submitted   that   plaintiff   has   examined   Sh.   H.K.   Lal,   UDC

from House Tax Department as PW 2 and he has clearly stated that

the plaintiff has not made the payment of house tax. The plaintiff has

failed to place on record even a single receipt towards the payment

of house tax.  It has been further argued that the plaintiff has failed

to perform his part of contract.   It has been further argued that the

sale deed has been admitted by the plaintiff and if the contents of the

sale deed are carefully gone through, it becomes clear that the entire

consideration was Rs. 7 lacs and the complete amount was paid and

as such, the question of retaining of Rs. 30,000/­ does not arise at all.

It has been further stated that there is no mention in the sale deed of

any kind of retention by the defendants of an amount of Rs. 30,000/­.

It  has  also  been  argued that  the document  Ex. PW 1/2 cannot  be

exhibited   and   cannot   be   looked   into   evidence   as   it   is   merely   a

photocopy and the execution of the original was not proved by any

kind   of   evidence.     It   has   been   further   argued   that   there   are   self

contradictory statements of the plaintiff itself.   It has been argued

that at one point of time, PW 1 has stated that copy of the agreement

Ex.   PW   1/2   was   handed   over  to   the   defendants   outside   the   Sub­

Registrar's   office   whereas   at   another   point   of   time   in   the  cross­

examination,  PW 1 has stated that the photocopy of Ex. PW 1/2 was

given to the defendants on 18.07.02.  It has been further argued that

PW 1 has stated at one point of time that he had kept the original of

the said agreement whereas at another point of time, PW 1 has stated

that it was lost on the same day when it was got registered and at

another point of time he has stated that on the date of filing the suit

the original of  Ex. PW 1/2 was not missing and it was with him.  It

has   been   further   argued   that   the   complaint   of   missing   of   the

document is completely false and the permission of the court to file

the secondary evidence has not been sought for by the plaintiff.  Ld.

counsel for the defendants has further argued that PW 1 is not sure

as to whether the payment was retained or the payment was made, as

such he could not prove the payment of Rs. 30,000/­ made to the

defendants.  It has been argued further that the document filed by the

plaintiff   has   not   been   proved,   therefore,   the   suit   of   the   plaintiff

deserves dismissal.

<p id="p_83">               In the light of the aforesaid evidence led by the parties

and in the light of the arguments advanced by both the Ld. Counsels

for the parties, this court has to see as to whether the plaintiff has

been able to prove the existence of agreement dated 18.07.02 or not,

or as to whether the plaintiff has been able to prove that Rs. 30,000/­

were  paid  by  the  plaintiff  to  the  defendants  or  Rs. 30,000/­  were

the sale deed Ex. PW 1/1 but he has lost the aforesaid document and

he has lodged a complaint with SHO P.S. Vikas Puri, which has been

proved on record as Ex. PW 1/3.  The plaintiff has examined PW 4,

who has proved on record the  Ex. PW 1/3, the complaint lodged by

the plaintiff with respect to the lost of document  Ex. PW 1/2.  The

plaintiff has examined PW 3, who was the witness to the execution

of the agreement dated 18.07.02   Ex. PW 1/2 and this witness has

clearly   stated   in   his   examination­in­chief   that     Ex.   PW   1/2   was

affidavit   and   on   23.04.07   he   tendered   his   evidence   by   way   of

through the part cross­examination, it is crystal clear that document

Ex. PW 1/2 was executed.  DW 1 has admitted that agreement was

written   on   18.07.02   between   him   and   the   plaintiff   regarding   Rs.

30,000/­.     DW   1   has   further   admitted   that   the   contents   of   this

document are of the agreement written between him and the plaintiff.

By way of volunteer, DW 1 has stated that the said agreement is the

photocopy of the original which was torn on the same day.   DW 1

has admitted that he had signed the original agreement of  Ex. PW

1/2 and at point  B, there are his signatures on the photocopy.  After

part cross­examination,  DW 1 failed to produce himself and further

cross­examination of DW 1 could not be conducted.

original   of   document     Ex.   PW   1/2   was   executed   in   between   the

</pre><p id="p_92">parties to the suit.   It has to be seen that in the Written Statement

filed on record, the defendants have clearly denied the execution of

any such agreement dated 18.07.02, but subsequently DW 1 in his

examination­in­chief, tendered by way of affidavit, has stated that

the said document was written but the same was never acted upon.

In the cross­examination, as well, DW 1 has admitted the execution

of the document  Ex. PW 1/2.  In the reply sent by the defendants Ex.

PW   1/5,   to   the   notice   of   the   plaintiff,     also   the   defendants   have

admitted the execution of the document  Ex. PW 1/2.  As such, I find

myself unable to agree with the submissions of the Ld. counsel for

the defendants that the plaintiff has failed to prove the execution of

the   document     Ex.   PW   1/2.     It   is   true   that   there   are   certain

contradictions   in   the   testimony   of   PW   1   regarding   missing   of

document  Ex. PW 1/2.  It is also true that the testimony of PW 1 is

</pre><p id="p_93">examination of DW 1, the inevitable conclusion is that the plaintiff

has been able to prove the execution of the document  Ex. PW 1/2.

It  is  also  true that  permission  to lead secondary evidence has  not

been sought for by the plaintiff but DW 1 has admitted the execution

of the document  Ex. PW 1/2  in the part cross­examination.  DW 1

has even admitted his signatures on the photocopy of the aforesaid

document, which has been proved on record as   Ex. PW 1/2.   As

such, I am of the opinion that the execution of  Ex. PW 1/2 has been

duly proved on record by the plaintiff.

<p id="p_94">             Now let us come to the controversy as advanced by Ld.

counsel for the defendants that in para nos. 3 and 6 of sale deed, it

has been clearly mentioned that entire consideration was Rs. 7 lacs

and the same was paid to the plaintiff by way of cheque and by way

               It is true that PW 1 has clearly admitted in the  cross­

examination that the entire consideration for sale of the property in

question was Rs. 7 lacs and the same was received by the plaintiff by

way of cheque and by way of draft.  It is also true that the plaintiff

has asserted that Rs. 30,000/­ were retained by the defendants.   Be

that as it may.  PW 3 has clearly stated that in the cross­examination

that Rs.30,000/­ were paid by the plaintiff to the defendants.  I am of

the opinion that going by the terminology, the retention or payment

does   not   matter.     The   plaintiff   has   proved   the   existence   of   Ex.

PW 1/2 and the plaintiff has shifted the burden upon the defendant,

now, to prove on record that the aforesaid document was torn on the

same   date   and   the   same  was  never  acted  upon,  because  once  the

defendants   have   admitted   the   execution   of   Ex.   PW   1/2,     the

defendants have taken a stand that the same was torn and was never

acted upon.  The question is, as to whether the defendants have been

able to prove on record that the document Ex. PW 1/2 was torn on

is   in   the   negative.     DW   1   after   part  cross­examination  failed   to

appear in the witness box and failed to get himself cross­examined.

In the light of the authority  AIR 1999 Supreme Court 1441 titled


Vidhyadhar   vs.   Mankikrao   and   another    inference   has   to   be

drawn against the defendants.

<p id="p_101">               I am of the opinion that the defendants have miserably

failed   to   prove   by   way   of   any   cogent   evidence   that   the   said

agreement Ex. PW 1/2 was never acted upon and the same was torn

off on the same date i.e. 18.07.2002.

<p id="p_102">               Now, let us come to the submissions of the Ld. counsel

who was responsible for payment of house tax till 18.07.02.   It is

true that according to terms of the sale deed Ex. PW 1/1, the plaintiff

is responsible for payment of house tax due up to 18.07.02.  It is also

true that PW 2 has clearly stated that the plaintiff has failed to pay

the aforesaid dues of house tax to the House Tax Department.  But

the defendants are at liberty to take any action available to them as

per law, according to the terms of the sale deed.  If the terms of the

agreement  Ex. PW 1/2 are carefully  gone through, it  is  clear that

Rs.30,000/­ were given by the plaintiff to the defendants or payment

of Rs. 30,000/­ was retained by the defendants against the dues of

house tax, electricity and water charges.   It is clearly mentioned in

the document Ex. PW 1/2 that if the dues are more than this amount

(Rs.30,000/­) then the first party (the plaintiff herein) will pay the

excess amount of the dues to deposit in the concerned departments

and in case the above mentioned dues are less than the same amount,

then the second party (the defendants herein) will return the balance

amount to the first party( the plaintiff herein).  

</p><p id="p_105">              From the testimony of PW 2, it is clear that neither the

                                                                                Contd...

Rs. 30,000/­ were retained or Rs. 30,000/­ were given by the plaintiff

to the defendants.

<p id="p_108">               As such, I am of the opinion that since the defendants

have failed to pay the dues of house tax in accordance with the terms

aforesaid amount to the plaintiff.

has   been   decreed   for     Rs.   30,000/­   which   were   retained   by   the

defendants and according to the terms of sale deed Ex. PW 1/1, it is

the plaintiff who is responsible to pay the dues of house tax  etc to

the concerned authorities till the date of execution of the sale deed

Ex.   PW   1/1   and   as   such,   I   am   of   the   opinion   that   prayer   for

mandatory injunction cannot be allowed in favour of the plaintiff.
