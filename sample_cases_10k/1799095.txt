<p id="p_1">       The challenge in this writ petition is against Ext.P7 and the

petitioner is also seeking a declaration that the petitioner is liable

to pay road tax concerning vehicle KL 9 A 3906 only at rates that

are applicable to non transport vehicles with effect from

10/12/2005. A direction to the respondents to issue a certificate

of fitness to the aforesaid vehicle is also sought for.

</p><p id="p_2">      2.    Petitioner submits that the vehicle in question was a

contract carriage and Ext.P3 is the permit. The certificate of

fitness expired on 9/12/2005 and thereafter the vehicle was not

being operated due to various reasons including mechanical

trouble. Petitioner wanted to make the vehicle roadworthy and

to use the same, he wanted to obtain a fresh certificate of

fitness. According to him, since 10/12/2005 as the vehicle was

not operational, his liability is only to pay road tax at rate

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                 :2 :</span>



applicable to non transport vehicles and therefore Ext.P4

representation was submitted to the 2nd respondent praying for

issuance of certificate of fitness and permitting him to pay tax at

non transport vehicle rates. It is stated that this request of the

petitioner was arbitrarily rejected by the 2nd respondent by

Ext.P7.   Challenging Ext.P7 and seeking the reliefs mentioned

above, this writ petition has been filed.
</p>
<p id="p_3">      3.   In the counter affidavit filed by the 2nd respondent, the

main contention that is raised is that the petitioner had not filed

G form for the period from 10/12/2005, when the vehicle in

question was stated to be not in use.         It is stated that the

requirement of G form is essential for any exemption from tax

and respondents place reliance on the Full Bench decision of this

court reported in       Regional Transport Officer V. Abdu

Rahiman (2007(1) KLT 613).
</p>
<p id="p_4">      4.   A reading    of Ext.P7 shows that the absence of G

forms is the reason for declining the relief prayed for by the

petitioner. It is also true that in the Full Bench judgment relied

WPC 36058/07

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                :3 :</span>



on by the respondents, it has been held that for any exemption

from the levy of Motor Vehicle Tax, G form is a condition

precedent. Section 5 of the Kerala Motor Vehicle Taxation Act,

1976 provides for exemption from tax.        In this case, what is

claimed by the petitioner is not exemption from tax, but the

claim is concerning the rate of tax that is applicable. As already

noticed, the contention of the petitioner is that since the validity

of the certificate of fitness expired on 9/12/2005 and as the

vehicle was also not operational, the liability of the petitioner is

only for tax at non transport vehicle rates.

</p><p id="p_5">      5.   Apart from that, petitioner rightly relies on Ext.P6 and

contends that in several similar cases, the benefit claimed by the

petitioner has been granted by the respondents. Ext.P6 is an

order that is passed by the Transport Commissioner, the relevant

portion of which reads as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">      The permit of the vehicle expired on 23/1/2000.
      Therefore the Registered owner is not liable to pay tax at
      contract carriage rate from 01/02/2000 to 31/12/2000.</blockquote><p id="p_6">
</p><p id="p_7">      Hence the revision petition is allowed upto an extent that
      Registered Owner will pay tax at contract carriage rate
      from 1/7/99 to 31/1/2000 and tax at Non Transport

WPC 36058/07

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                 :4 :</span>



     Vehicle rate from1/2/2000 to 31/12/2000. The Revision
     Petition is disposed of accordingly.
</p>
<p id="p_8">Thus, a reading of Ext.P6 shows that the petitioner is justified in

contending that benefit similar to what is claimed by him has

been granted in Ext.P6. However, I notice that Ext.P6 has not

been referred to or relied on by the 2nd respondent while

rendering Ext.P7.
</p>
<p id="p_9">     For these reasons, I set aside Ext.P7 and direct the 2nd

respondent to reconsider the matter in the light of the

observations made herein above. Orders in this respect, shall be

passed as expeditiously as possible, at any rate within six weeks

of production of a copy of this judgment.
