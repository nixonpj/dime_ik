                               JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">   The petitioners claim to be Head Load and General

   Workers affiliated to Kerala Head Load and General

   Workers Union. They also claim that they are working in

   the areas of the KINFRA Industrial Park, Kakkancherry.

   Complaining that in a scheme covered area they were

   denied work, they submitted to the 5th respondent a

   series of representations, the last of them being the

   Ext.P7.
</p>
<p id="p_2">2. The petitioners' counsel submits that besides submitting

   the Exts.P5 to P7 representations, the petitioners have

   also submitted statutory applications. Now, he wants the

   Assistant Labour Officer, the 5th respondent, to consider

   the petitioners' representations.

</p><p id="p_3">3. The learned Standing Counsel for the 6th respondent

W.P.(C). No. 7001 of 2018 (A)



      Board submits that the Assistant Labour Officer may, as

      well, put the Board on notice before considering the

      petitioners' representations.
</p>
<p id="p_4">4. The learned Government Pleader, on her part, submits

      that the Assistant Labour Officer will consider the

      petitioners' claim on merits.
</p>
<p id="p_5">5. Under these circumstances, without adverting to the

      merits of the matter, I dispose of the writ petition,

      holding that the Assistant Labour Officer will consider

      the petitioners' representations, subject to their

      maintainability, and pass orders, after putting the Board

      on notice, expeditiously, in two months.
