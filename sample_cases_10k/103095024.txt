CM-1796-LPA-2018

             Instant application has been filed under <a href="/doc/100581/" id="a_1">Section 5</a> of the

Limitation Act seeking condonation of delay of 526 days that has occurred

in filing the accompanying appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_2">             The    basis     for    seeking       condonation    is   that      the

applicant/appellant was not aware of the law of limitation.

</p><p id="p_3">             No ground for condonation is made out.
</p>
<p id="p_4">             Application is dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_5">Main Case

</p><p id="p_6">1.           The instant Letters Patent Appeal has been filed under clause X

of the Letter Patent against judgement dated 22.10.2016 passed by the

learned Single Judge and whereby CWP-22378-2012 filed by the appellant

herein was dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_7">2.           Appellant had assailed before the Writ Court the order dated

13.12.2010    passed    by    the    Industrial    Tribunal-cum-Labour        Court,

Chandigarh whereby an industrial dispute having been raised by the



                                       1 of 3

</p>
<p id="p_8">appellant consequent to his dismissal from service, the reference has been

answered against him.
</p>
<p id="p_9">3.          Briefly, it may be noticed that appellant joined service with the

Industrial and Tourism Development Corporation on 25.6.1991 on the post

of Room Attendant in Hotel Shivalik View. He was imposed the major

penalty of dismissal from service on the charge that on the intervening night

of 19/20.5.2001 two lady guests had checked into Room No.406 of the hotel

and the appellant had harassed the lady guests.

</p><p id="p_10">4.          Appellant having raised a dispute, the same was referred to the

Industrial Tribunal-cum-Labour Court, Chandigarh. The reference was

answered against him on 13.12.2010 and the same was challenged by way

of filing a writ petition. Learned Single Judge has dismissed the petition

vide impugned judgement dated 22.10.2016.
</p>
<p id="p_11">5.          The sole contention raised by the learned counsel representing

the appellant is that during the course of inquiry proceedings the

complainants had not been examined and as such the findings of the

disciplinary authority recorded against the delinquent could not sustain.

</p><p id="p_12">6.          Having heard counsel for the appellant at length, we are of the

considered view that there is no merit in the instant appeal and the same

deserves to be dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_13">7.          Learned Single Judge while dismissing the petition and

upholding the order dated 13.12.2010 passed by the Industrial Tribunal-

cum-Labour Court Chandigarh has taken note of the fact that regular

departmental proceedings were initiated against the appellant after

formulating specific articles of charge as regards the appellant having




                                     2 of 3
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                  ::: Downloaded on - 20-05-2018 09:21:54 :::</span>
 LPA-658-2018 (O&amp;M)                                   -3-
</p>
<p id="p_14">misbehaved with two lady guests who had checked into the hotel. Non-

examination of the complainants was observed to be of no consequence as

the complainants were ladies and were not residents of Chandigarh and even

otherwise it would have been embarrassing for them to have come forth and

deposed.
</p>
<p id="p_15">8.           Learned counsel for the appellant is not in a position to rebut

the observation recorded by the learned Single Judge to the effect that

during the course of inquiry the delinquent (appellant herein) in response to

a particular question had admitted that the lady guests having come out of

the room and having pointed towards the appellant calling him the culprit,

he had then proceeded to hide himself in Room No.412.

</p><p id="p_16">9.           We find that the charge against the appellant herein involves
moral turpitude and has been duly proved during the course of regular
departmental proceedings. The appellant has not been able to demonstrate
any patent infirmity during the course of proceedings which led to the
culmination of the imposition of major penalty of dismissal and accordingly
the reference was declined by the Labour Court.
</p><p id="p_17">10.          Learned Single Judge has minutely examined the inquiry
proceedings conducted against the appellant and has recorded a finding that
there was sufficient evidence brought on record to prove the charges
leveled.
</p><p id="p_18">11.          No interference in the matter is warranted.
</p><p id="p_19">             Appeal is dismissed on merits as well as on the ground of
delay.</p><pre id="pre_2">
