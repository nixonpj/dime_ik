  IN THE HIGH COURT OF KARNATAKA AT BANGALORE

        DATED THIS THE 19TH DAY OF JUNE 2014

                        BEFORE

           THE HON'BLE MR.JUSTICE N.ANANDA

                M.F.A.No.1033/2012 (MV)
BETWEEN:

   (BY SRI B.B.BAJENTRI, ADV. FOR R1; SRI P.B.RAJU,
   ADVOCATE FOR R2)

     THIS APPEAL IS FILED UNDER SECTION 173(1) OF MV
ACT AGAINST THE JUDGMENT AND AWARD DATED 30.08.2011
PASSED IN MVC NO.184/2011 ON THE FILE OF PRESIDING
OFFICER, FAST TRACK COURT AT HUNSUR, PARTLY ALLOWING
THE CLAIM PETITION FOR COMPENSATION AND SEEKING
ENHANCEMENT OF COMPENSATION.

      THIS APPEAL COMING ON FOR FINAL HEARING THIS
DAY, THE COURT DELIVERED THE FOLLOWING:
                                2



                         JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">      The claimant has filed this appeal for enhancement of

compensation.
</p>
<p id="p_2">2.    I have heard the learned counsel for parties.

</p><p id="p_3">3.    The finding of Tribunal that driver of insured vehicle

did not possess valid and effective driving licence. Therefore,

insured (I-respondent) is liable to pay compensation has

attained finality. Since the said finding has not been

challenged either by claimant or by I-respondent, therefore

the only question that would arise for determination in this

appeal is:-
</p>
<p id="p_4">              "Whether    claimant   is   entitled    for
      enhancement of compensation?"
</p>
<p id="p_5">4.    As per wound certificate issued by Cauvery Hospital at

Mysore, claimant had suffered following injuries:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">      1. Swelling of right thigh and limb externally
         rotated with painful movements. X-ray of
         right thigh shows fracture of shaft of femur
         bone.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">      2. Lacerated wound over right knee measuring
         7 cms x 2 cms x 1 cm.
</blockquote><span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                  3</span>


<blockquote id="blockquote_3">        3. Lacerated wound over right leg measuring
           3 cms x 1 cm x 0.5 cm.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">        4. Sutured wound over        left   side   forehead
           measuring 3 cms.</blockquote><p id="p_6">

</p><p id="p_7">        The claimant was operated for reduction of fracture of
right femur.
</p><p id="p_8">        The claimant had spent a sum of Rs.58,000/- towards

"medical expenses". The claimant was aged about 55 years

at the time of accident. He was an agriculturist. The

claimant suffers from permanent physical disability of right

lower limb.
</p>
<p id="p_9">5.      The    Tribunal   has    awarded      compensation    of

Rs.98,000/- under the following heads:-

I. Pain and suffering, loss of
     amenities and future unhappiness:        Rs.40,000/-
II. Medical expenses including
     Nourishment, Attendant and
     Conveyance charges etc.           :      Rs.58,000/-

</p><p id="p_10">               Total                   :      Rs.98,000/-
</p>
<p id="p_11">6.      The compensation awarded by Tribunal clearly reflects

non-application of mind by Tribunal. The Tribunal has

ignored the principle of law that compensation should be
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                 4</span>


separately assessed and awarded under recognised heads.

Therefore, compensation awarded by Tribunal has to be re-

assessed.
</p>
<p id="p_12">7.      The claimant had suffered fracture of right femur. He

was aged about 55 years at the time of accident. Therefore, I

award     compensation   of   Rs.30,000/-       towards       "pain   &amp;

suffering. The claimant had spent a sum of Rs.58,000/-

towards      "medical    expenses".       Therefore,      I     award

compensation of Rs.58,000/- towards "medical expenses".

The claimant suffers from permanent physical disability of

right lower limb consequent to residual effects of fracture of

right   femur.   The    claimant    was    an    agriculturist        by

occupation. Having regard to nature of injuries and residual

effects of injuries, I determine permanent physical disability

vis-Ã -vis loss of earning capacity at 10% and determine

income of claimant at Rs.5,000/- per month or Rs.60,000/-

per annum. Thus, claimant is entitled to compensation of

Rs.66,000/- (Rs.5,000/- x 12 x 11 x 10%) towards "loss of

earning capacity &amp; loss of future earnings". The claimant is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                     5</span>


entitled to compensation of Rs.24,000/- towards "loss of

earnings    during      laid   up       period",    compensation    of

Rs.30,000/- towards "loss of amenities &amp; enjoyment of life",

compensation      of    Rs.20,000/-       towards    "future   medical

expenses"   and        compensation       of   Rs.10,000/-     towards

"conveyance and attendant charges". Thus, claimant is

entitled to total compensation of Rs.2,38,000/-.

</p><p id="p_13">8.    In the result, I pass the following:-

</p><p id="p_14">                               ORDER

      The appeal is accepted in part. The impugned award is

modified. Compensation of Rs.98,000/- awarded by Tribunal

is enhanced to Rs.2,38,000/-. The finding of Tribunal that

compensation is payable by the owner of insured vehicle (I-

respondent before Tribunal) is confirmed. The impugned

award as it relates to rate of interest, period of accrual of

interest and ratio of payment and investment is confirmed.
