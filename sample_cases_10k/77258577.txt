*      IN THE HIGH COURT OF DELHI AT NEW DELHI
+      W.P.(C) 1373/2017
                                      Date of Decision : 17th February, 2017

       AMIT KUMAR                                            ..... Petitioner
                            Through      Mr. Asish Nischal and Mr. Arun

       SANJIV KHANNA, J. (ORAL):
</p>
<p id="p_3">             The petitioner-Amit Kumar by this writ petition impugns the
       order dated 19.01.2017 whereby OA No. 1963/2015 filed by him has
       been dismissed by the Principal Bench of Central Administrative
       Tribunal, New Delhi.
</p><p id="p_4">       2.    The petitioner by the aforesaid OA had prayed for
       compassionate appointment, his father having expired on 13.12.2005.
       Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the father of the
       petitioner was to superannuate on 31.08.2021 and the petitioner, at the
       time of the death of his father, was about 17 years of age.
</p><p id="p_5">       3.    The Screening Committee did not recommend the case of the



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">       WP(C) No.1373/2017                                            Page 1 of 3</span>
 petitioner for compassionate appointment in 2008, 2009 and 2010.
In 2010 the case was also directed to be finally closed. Notings on
record show that the petitioner's claim was re-considered in 2014 in
light of the circular dated 16.08.2013 and rejected by the Screening
Committee.
</p><p id="p_6">4.    The petitioner approached the Tribunal vide the aforesaid OA
only in 2015, nearly 10 years after the death of his father.
</p><p id="p_7">5.    Given the aforesaid delay and repeated rejections in 2008, 2009
and 2010, we do not think it would be appropriate and proper to
interfere with the impugned order. Compassionate appointment is
restricted to 5% of the total vacancies. In view of the said rule
position, the compassionate appointment is to be offered to most
deserving and compelling cases, keeping in view the respective
financial condition and family circumstances. A Screening Committee
undertakes the said evaluation. In the present case, the petitioner is
unable to establish and show that the Screening Committee had
wrongly rejected his case and gave undue benefit to the third persons
in 2008, 2009 and 2010.
</p><p id="p_8">6.    Learned counsel for the petitioner, has drawn our attention to
page 188 of the writ paper book and submitted that the Screening
Committee in 2014 had wrongly recorded that the petitioner has a
mother and one sister aged 22 years. He submits that the petitioner in
fact has two sisters. Page 188 of the paper book relates to the rejection
for compassionate appointment in 2014. This order also records that
the case of the petitioner was considered in 2008, 2009 and 2010,
when the claim was finally closed.
</p>

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">WP(C) No.1373/2017                                             Page 2 of 3</span>
<p id="p_9"> 7.    We have also considered the application filed by the petitioner
seeking compassionate appointment. The details of the sisters,
whether they are studying or in service are not specifically mentioned
in the application. We would not adjudicate this writ petition on the
basis of challenge to the observations and findings recorded by the
Screening Committee in 2014, nine years after the father had expired.
The objective and purpose behind compassionate appointment is to
tide over immediate financial distress and shock, on account of
sudden death. Lapse of several years necessarily weakens such claim.
</p><p id="p_10">8.    In view of the aforesaid, the writ petition has no merit and is
accordingly dismissed.    There would be no order as to costs.
