behalf of respondent No.2-first informant. Ms.Rana, learned
counsel shall file her Vakalatnama on behalf of respondent No.2-
First Informant during the course of the day.
</p><p id="p_3">3.    Considering the issue involved in the application and with
consent of learned counsel appearing for the parties, this
application is taken up for final disposal forthwith.
</p>
<p id="p_4">4.    By way of this application under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_1">Section 482</a> of the Code of
Criminal Procedure, 1973 (hereinafter referred to as "the Code"),
the applicant has prayed for quashing and setting aside FIR
bearing C.R.No.I-26 of 2014 registered with Sinor Police Station,
Dist: Vadodara, for the offences punishable under <a href="/doc/1868826/" id="a_2">Sections 498(A)</a>
and <a href="/doc/92983/" id="a_3">306</a> of the Indian Penal Code.
</p>
<p id="p_5">5.    Learned counsel for the applicant has submitted that the
applicant and respondent No.2-first informant have settled the
dispute and therefore, any further continuance of the proceedings
pursuant to the impugned FIR would create hardship to the parties
and on the contrary, would be detrimental to the relations between
the applicant and respondent No.2. It was further submitted that in
view of the fact that the dispute is resolved, the trial would be futile
and any further continuance of the proceedings would amount to
abuse of process of law. Therefore, this Court may exercise its
inherent powers conferred under <a href="/doc/903398/" id="a_4">Section 482</a> of the Code and
allow the present application as prayed for.
</p>
<p id="p_6">6.    Learned Additional Public Prosecutor for respondent No.1-
State, has candidly submitted that in view of the fact that the
parties have amicably resolved the dispute which was more of a
personal nature, this Court may pass appropriate orders.

</p><p id="p_8">7.   Learned counsel for respondent No.2-first informant has
tendered an affidavit dated 17.07.2014 filed by respondent No.2,
who is personally present in the Court and is identified by learned
counsel for respondent No.2. Upon further enquiry, Mr.Chhatrasinh
Himmatsinh Rana- first informant has categorically stated before
this Court that he has settled the dispute with the applicant and
now no dispute remains. Therefore, present application deserves
to be allowed as prayed for.
</p>
<p id="p_9">8.   Learned counsel for respondent No.2 has produced a
photocopy of the PAN card in order to establish the identity of
respondent No.2. It may also further be noted that the parties have
also placed on record a copy of MOU dated 12.07.2014, which is
also taken on record. It is further provided that the parties shall
adhere to the terms of the MOU, which is executed between the
parties and produced before the Court. Learned counsel for the
applicant assures this Court the welfare of the child which is
reflected in the MOU shall be adhered to by the applicant.
</p>
<p id="p_10">9.   Having heard the learned counsel appearing for the
respective parties, considering the facts and circumstances arising
out of the present application as well as taking into consideration
the decisions rendered in the cases of Gian Singh Vs. State of
Punjab &amp; Anr., reported in (2012) 10 SCC 303, Narinder Singh
and Ors. Vs. State of Punjab &amp; Anr., reported in 2014(6) SCC 466,

           R/SCR.A/2920/2014                            JUDGMENT



Territory, reported in AIR 2013 SC 518, it appears that further
continuation of criminal proceedings in relation to the impugned
FIR against the applicant would be unnecessary harassment to the
applicant. It appears that the trial would be futile and further
continuance of the proceedings pursuant to the impugned FIR
would amount to abuse of process of law and Court and hence, to
secure the ends of justice, the impugned FIR is required to be
quashed and set aside in exercise of powers conferred under
<a href="/doc/903398/" id="a_5">Section 482</a> of the Code.
</p>
<p id="p_11">10.      Resultantly, present application is allowed. Impugned FIR
bearing C.R.No.I-26 of 2014 registered with Sinor Police Station,
Dist: Vadodara, filed against the present applicant is hereby
quashed and set aside. Consequently, any other proceedings, if
any, arising out of the aforesaid FIR, are also quashed and set
aside. It is however, clarified that this judgment would apply only to
the present applicant. Accordingly, Rule is made absolute. Direct
Service is permitted.
