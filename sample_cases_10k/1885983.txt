                    ================
                W.P.(C) NO. 17414 OF 2009 (V)
                =====================

             Dated this the 6th day of July, 2009

                         J U D G M E N T
</pre>

<p id="p_1">      Petitioners are partnership firms, which have established

two ice plants in the small scale sector and were availing of power

supply with consumer Nos.13952 and 9956 respectively.

</p><p id="p_2">      2.    The 4th respondent inspected the premises of the

petitioners on 4/4/2000 and Exts.P1 and P2 are the mahazars

prepared. A reading of these mahazars show that in so far as the

first petitioner   is  concerned,   the   lead   wire  was    found

disconnected. In so far as the second petitioner is concerned, the

4th respondent found a gap in the corner glass of the energy

metre. On this basis, theft of energy was alleged and supply to

their premises was disconnected.
</p>
<p id="p_3">      3.    By Exts.P3 and P4, petitioners filed appeals before the

3rd respondent and meanwhile, they also filed OP 11597/2000 for

restoration of power supply. Accordingly, orders were passed

directed restoration of supply on payment of Rs.50,000/- each.

Subsequently, they were issued Exts.P5 and P6 demand notices

demanding Rs.5,90,412/- and Rs.4,74,731/- respectively.        They

say that again appeals were filed to the 3rd respondent, copies of

which are Exts.P7 and P8. While so, against both the petitioners,

criminal cases were lodged and Exts.P9 and P10 are the FIRs

lodged against both of them.           It would appear that on

investigation, police filed refer reports, copies of which are

Exts.P11 and P12.
</p>
<p id="p_4">      4.   At that stage, by Ext.P17, OP No.11597/2000, which

was earlier filed by the petitioners, was disposed of directing

disposal of Exts.P3 and P4 appeals taking into account the refer

reports referred to above also. It is stated that at about that

stage, protest complaints were filed by the 4th respondent, copies

of which are Exts.P18 and P19 and cognizance was taken and

were numbered by the Criminal Court as CC 513/03 and 514/03.

Trial was held and by Ext.P20, the first petitioner was acquitted in

CC 513/03 and by Ext.P21, the second petitioner was convicted in

CC 514/03. It is stated that the second petitioner has filed an

appeal as Criminal Appeal No.909/08, which is pending

consideration of the District Court, Ernakulam.

</p><p id="p_5">      5.   Meanwhile, the 3rd respondent issued Exts.P22 and P23

invoices, scheduling hearing of Exts.P3 and P4 appeals, and on its

WPC 17414/09
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                  :3 :</span>



receipt, petitioners have filed Exts.P24 and P25 written

statements as well. They were accordingly heard and finally the

appeals were rejected by Exts.P30 and P31. Following the above

orders, revised bills were also issued as per Exts.P32 and P33. It

is in these circumstances, the writ petition is filed.

</p><p id="p_6">       6.   The main contention raised      by the counsel for the

petitioners is that the first petitioner was acquitted by Ext.P20

judgment of the criminal court in CC 513/03. A reading of Ext.P20

judgment rendered by the Criminal Court show that it has been

held that on going through the evidence, two probabilities are

possible as regards the manipulation in Y and B phases of the

metre. The Magistrate Court accordingly held that it could either

be caused due to the omission of the Board officials at the time of

electric connection or it was caused by the accused in connivance

and consent with the officials of the Board. Proceeding further, it

was held that when two probabilities are possible, then the

probability in favour of the accused should be appreciated. It is

on that basis, the first petitioner was acquitted.

</p><p id="p_7">       7.   Having considered the submissions made, in my view,

even if the petitioners are taken to have been acquitted as

WPC 17414/09
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                 :4 :</span>



contended in this writ petition, that by itself will not exonerate the

petitioners from the liability to pay the dues, which are found to

be payable by the Board as per Exts.P32 and P33.                 Even

otherwise, the judgment shows that the court was extending

benefit of doubt and the acquittal cannot be said to be on merits

and free from all blames. If that be so, the judgment of the court

by itself will not come to the rescue of the petitioners to avoid the

liability.
</p>
<p id="p_8">       8.   Be that as it may, it is seen that Exts.P3 and P4

appeals were filed by the petitioners as early as on 5/4/2000.

There was no order passed by any court or other superior

authority restraining the respondents from passing orders on the

appeals. Therefore, the delay in the disposal of the appeals is

attributable only to the respondents and the petitioners cannot be

penalised for that delay in as much as Exts.P30 and P31 orders

rejecting the appeals were rendered only on 6/6/2009.

</p><p id="p_9">       9.   A reading of Exts.P32 and P33, the revised invoices

and the calculation statements attached to the said invoices show

that surcharge has been levied on the petitioners for the period

from April 2000 to June, 2009. This in my view, is totally

WPC 17414/09
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                 :5 :</span>



unjustified and that the petitioners could not have been penalised

for the delay which was caused only for reasons attributable to

the officers of the Board. To the extent surcharge which has been

levied for the period when the appeal was kept pending by the

officers of the Board, Exts.P32 and P33 needs to be revised.

</p><p id="p_10">      Accordingly, the writ petition will stand disposed of quashing

the surcharge levied on the petitioners for the period April 2000

to June 2009 and directing that it will be open to the respondents

to issue revised invoices to the petitioners demanding payment.
