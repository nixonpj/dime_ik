    Sampatlal Budhmal Soni (original accused no.4) challenged the order

    which was decided by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Gondia by
                         
    judgment and order dated 26th September 2003 whereby                    the appeal

    198/1993        regarding final disposal of the property ( 2 gold ingots) of

    1999 passed in Criminal Case No.198/1993.                 Reference was made to the

    Disclosure    Statement       made   by    accused     Ramesh            on     14.5.1993




                                                                                  
    regarding     selling   of     golden and silver ornaments to accused no.4




                                                          
    Sampatlal,         as also statement (Exh.65) and subsequent                      recovery

    consequent to disclosure statement under Panchnama (Exh.66)                              and

    furthermore disclosure        statement by accused Hitendra                 on 23rd May




                                                         
    19943 as per Exh.69              and consequent       recovery under Panchnama

    (Exh.70).     This appears      in the evidence of PSI Selokar as also in the




                                             
    evidence of Investigating Officer.
</p>
<p id="p_6">    5.
                            
                 It appears that the Appellate Court was pleased to set aside

    the order regarding      disposal of the property mainly on the ground that
                           
    the complainant was not examined in the case to identify the property

    as his own and that trial Court should have recorded finding that the
      

    property seized from the appellant (Sampatlal Budhmal Soni) is stolen
   



    property and that it has been property owned by the complainant.
</p>
<p id="p_7">    6.           It appears that the Appellate Court failed to take note of

    Disclosure statement         pursuant to which the property was recovered and





    handed over to the complainant on Supratnama pending disposal of the

    criminal trial.     The Disclosure        statement       which is      confessional in





    nature, though inadmissible evidence in criminal                       trial, would be

    admissible in inquiry         to determine    as     to     who would be the best

    entitled to possession of the seized property.              The proceedings in this




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                                          ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 13:57:43 :::</span>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                            4</span>


    regard ought to be considered as        quasi civil in nature for disposal of

    the property    finally under <a href="/doc/1289794/" id="a_3">section 452</a> of the Cr.P.C.              The     rule of




                                                                            
    burden of proof as in criminal trial shall not apply as to           final disposal




                                                    
    of the seized property as it relates to immediate right to possession.                It

    is true that such order would not be conclusive as to the right or title

    to the ownership        of property disposed of under <a href="/doc/1289794/" id="a_4">section 452</a> Cr.P.C. as




                                                   
    it is always subject to decision of the competent Civil Court.            Therefore,

    the order which was passed by the learned Magistrate at the conclusion




                                         
    of the trial directing the seized property to be retained by the complainant
                           
    particularly when it was in possession of the complainant on the basis of

    supratnama executed by him pending the trial ought not to have been set
                          
    aside for the aforesaid reason. The appropriate remedy for the accused

    who wanted to challenge the final order regarding disposal of property
      

    u/s 452 of the <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_5">Cr.P.C</a>. could have been to claim by way of independent
   



    civil suit claiming   right, title or ownership of the property. Considering

    that the learned      Magistrate   was legal, proper and correct to pass an

    order u/s. 452        <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_6">Cr.P.C</a>. regarding final disposal of the property at





    conclusion of trial    it ought not to have been interfered with by learned

    Addl. Sessions Judge, Gondia, in appeal.
</p>




<p id="p_8">    7.         For the     aforesaid reasons, I think that no exceptional case

    was made out before the Appellate Court below pointing out any manifest

    and patent error      of law resulting into flagrant miscarriage of justice.
</p>

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                         5</span>


<p id="p_9">    In my view, therefore, the order which was passed by the trial Court must

    be restored as it appears prima facie legal, proper and correct.            Hence I
