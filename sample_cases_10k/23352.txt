      IN THE HIGH COURT FOR THE STATES OF PUNJAB AND
                  HARYANA AT CHANDIGARH

                                       CWP No.15827 of 1990
                                       Date of decision: February 27, 2009.

Association of Registered Medical Practitioners &amp; Ors.
                                                          ...Petitioner(s)

            v.
State of Haryana &amp; Ors.

                                                          ...Respondent(s)

CORAM:HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE SURYA KANT

1. Whether Reporters of local papers may be allowed to see the judgment ?
2. Whether to be referred to the Reporters or not ?
3. Whether the judgment should be reported in the Digest?

Present:     None for the parties.
                                     ORDER
</pre><p id="p_1">Surya Kant, J. - (Oral):
</p>
<p id="p_2">             The petitioners seek quashing of State of Haryana's decision in

not permitting them to practise in Ayurvedic and Unani System of

Medicines and also seek a direction to the respondents not to interfere with

their profession of medical practitioner in Ayurvedic and Unani System of

Medicines.
</p>
<p id="p_3">             Briefly stated, the facts are the petitioners claim to have passed

the degree of Ayurveda Rattan from Hindi Sahitya Sammelan Paryag,

Allahabad. Based on that, they got themselves registered with the State

Ayurvedic and Unani Chikitsa Council, Bihar and are claiming to have been

practising in the State of Haryana from last over 20 years. Their grievance

is that the State of Haryana has now refused to recognize the professional

degree obtained by them from Hindi Sahitya Sammelan, Prayag as well as

their registration by the State Ayurveduc and Unani Chikitsa Council, Bihar.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1"> CWP No.15827 of 1990                                    -: 2 :-</span>


</p><p id="p_4">            The respondents have filed their counter affidavit taking a

categoric plea that the Hindi Sahitya Sammelan Parishad, from where the

petitioners are reported to have obtained their degree of Ayurved Rattan, is

not recognized by the Govt. of India and that only those practitioners of

Indian Medicine are entitled to practise in Ayurvedic and Unani Medicine in

the State of Haryana who are either registered under the Punjab Ayurvedic

and Unani Practitioners Act, 1963, as applicable to the State of Haryana, or

the <a href="/doc/1423048/" id="a_1">Indian Medicine Central Council Act</a>, 1970. Since the petitioners are

not registered practitioners under the above stated State and/or the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_2">Central

Act</a>s, they are not entitled to practise as the professional medical

practitioners in the State of Haryana.
</p>
<p id="p_5">            On December 13, 1990, notice of motion was issued on the

premise that though the identical writ petition, i.e., CWP No.3670 of 1985

had already been dismissed by a learned Single Judge on 14.2.1986, the

Letters Patent Appeal against the said judgment was admitted and pending.

</p><p id="p_6">            The Office has reported that LPA No.261 of 1986 against the

above mentioned judgment of the learned Single Judge has also been

dismissed by a Division Bench of this Court by an elaborate judgment dated

December 09, 1993.
</p>
<p id="p_7">            Having gone through the Division Bench judgment dated

December 9, 1993 in LPA No.261 of 1986 (Mohmad Azam &amp; Ors. v.

State of Haryana &amp; Ors.), I do not find any merit in this writ petition

which is accordingly dismissed for the reasons assigned in Mohmad Azam's

case (supra).</p><pre id="pre_2">
