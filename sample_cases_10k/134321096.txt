       BRIEF FACTS OF THE COMPLAINT ARE AS FOLLOWED:­
</p><p id="p_2">   1. The   complainant   has   stated   it   is   a   nationalized   bank 
      incorporated   under   the   Banking   Companies   (Acquisition   of 
      Transfer   and   <a href="/doc/984780/" id="a_4">Undertaking)   Act</a>,   1970.   It   is   stated   that   M/s 
      Mahinder Enterprises, a proprietorship concern of Sh. Kartar 
      Singh has availed credit facility   from the complainant bank 
      wherein   Sh.   Anoop   Singh,   stood   as   a   guarantor   of   the   said 
      firm. It  is further stated  that  M/s Mahinder  Enterprise after 
      availing   the   credit   facility   did   not   maintain   the   financial 
      discipline   and   became   defaulter.   Thereafter,   complainant 
      bank filed the Civil Suit for recovery of bank dues against the 
      borrower as well as the guarantor. The said suit was decreed 
      by the Debt Recovery Tribunal (herein after referred as "DRT") 
      on   21.05.1999   vide   which   both   the   borrower   as   well   as   the 
      guarantor   were   made   liable   to   pay   a   sum   of   Rs.   38   lacs   by 
      20.01.2001 in quarterly installments and interest @ 14.1% p.a 
      w.e.f 20.01.2000.
</p><p id="p_3">   2. It is further stated that the accused in order to discharge of his 
      liability issued a cheque  bearing no. 461918 dated 28.03.2004 
      for Rs. 20 lacs drawn on State Bank of India.  It is further stated 
      that when the said cheque was presented for encashment, it 
      got dishnoured and was returned unpaid with remarks "refer 
      to drawer" vide return memo dated 26.05.2004.
</p><p id="p_4">   3. Thereafter,   complainant   had   issued   legal   demand   notice 
      dated   02.06.2004,   with   request   to   the   accused   to   pay   the 
      amount of Rs. 20 lacs. However, despite service of legal notice, 
      accused   failed   to   pay   the   said   amount.   Hence   a   complaint 
      under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_5">Section 138</a> Negotiable Act (herein after referred as "<a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_6">N.I 
      Act</a>") was filed before this court on 17.07.2004.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">CC No. 717/12                                                              Page No. 2</span>
<p id="p_5">    4. After   filing   the   complaint,   the   complainant   lead   Pre­
      summoning Evidence and the accused was summoned vide 
      order   dated   17.07.2004.   After   appearance   of   the   accused   , 
      notice under <a href="/doc/429078/" id="a_7">Section 251</a> Cr.P.C was framed on 06.06.2009, in 
      which  the accused pleaded  not  guilty  and  claimed trial.    In 
      post   summoning   evidence,   accused   examined   its   AR 
      Sh. G.Mishra as CW1, who tendered his affidavit of evidence as 
      Ex. CW1/Y and  relied upon the following documents:­ 
</p><p id="p_6">      a) Complaint as Ex. PW1/1. 
</p><p id="p_7">       b) Order dated 21.05.1999 passed by DRT as Ex. PW1/2
</p><p id="p_8">      c) Order dated 23.09.2003 passed by DRT as Ex. PW1/3. 
</p><p id="p_9">          d)  Cheque 461918 dated 28.03.2004 for Rs. 20 lacs drawn on 
           State Bank  of India as Ex. PW1/4.
</p><p id="p_10">      e) Return memo dated 26.05.2004 as Ex. PW1/5. 
</p><p id="p_11">      f) copy of legal notice dated  02.06.2004 as Ex. PW1/6. 
</p><p id="p_12">      g) Postal receipts,   AD card   and UPC as Ex. PW1/7 ,   PW1/8  
      and PW1/9 respectively.   
</p>

<p id="p_13">   5. The said witness was cross examined by the accused  and C.E 
      was closed on 02.11.2011.   Thereafter, statement of accused 
      under <a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_8">Section 313</a> Cr.P.C was recorded on 16.05.2012 and all 
      the   incriminating   evidence   was   put   to   him.     Accused   had 
      stated that he wants to lead D.E. Accused examined Sh. A.M 
      Sridhar, Chief Manager of UCO Bank as DW1 who brought the 
      summoned   record   which   was   exhibited   as   Ex.   DW1/1 
      (running into 55 pages). Thereafter, accused examined himself 
      as DW2 and he exhibited the documents which were already 
      exhibited by DW1. The said witness was not cross examined 
      by   the   complainant,   despite   opportunity.   Thereafter,   the 

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">CC No. 717/12                                                       Page No. 3</span>
       opportunity   of   the   complainant   to   cross   examine   DW2   was 
      closed and   D.E was closed   on 08.04.2013. Then the matter 
      was listed for final arguments.
</p><p id="p_14">   6. Final   Arguments   were   advanced   only   by   accused. 
      Complainant  failed   to  advance   arguments,  despite   repeated 
      opportunity. 
</p><p id="p_15">   7. In this case,  the complainant has stated that the accused was 
      the guarantor of the loan taken by his father Sh. Kartar Singh 
      and compromise was arrived between the parties before the 
      Ld.   DRT   on   21.05.1999   .   In   view   of   the   compromise   the 
      accused issued cheque which when presented for encashment 
      got   dishonoured.   Then   the   legal   notice   was   issued   but   the 
      accused failed to make payment to the complainant. Hence all 
      the   necessary   ingredients   of   <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_9">Section   138</a>   NI.   Act   have   been 
      proved and the accused is liable to be convicted under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_10">Section 
      138</a> of the N.I Act.
</p><p id="p_16">   8. On the other hand, Ld. Counsel for the accused has denied the 
      contentions   of   the   Ld.   Counsel   for   the   complainant.   It   is 
      submitted on behalf of the Ld. Counsel for the accused that 
      the   complainant   has   failed   to   prove   his   case   and   the 
      complaint   is   liable   to   be   dismissed.   He   has   raised   the 
      following objections:­
</p><p id="p_17">      a)   There   is   no   legal   liability   of   the   accused   as   regular  
      payment has been made by the accused. 
</p><p id="p_18">      b)The cheque in question was issued as a security cheque. 
</p><p id="p_19">      c) Thirdly, no legal notice was received by the accused.
</p>



       

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">CC No. 717/12                                                           Page No. 4</span>
<p id="p_20">    9. Now, coming to the first contention of the accused. Accused 
      has stated that the he has made regular payment against the 
      cheque in question and hence the present complaint is not 
      maintainable.   Perusal   of   the   file   reveals   that   the   cheque   in 
      question is dated 28.03.2004 and the same was dishonoured 
      on 26/05/2004. Thereafter, complaint was filed on 17.07.2004. 
      The cheque is of Rs. 20 lacs while the accused had made the 
      payment of Rs. 4 lacs on 04.09.2004 . In that case, only part 
      payment was made that to after filing of the complaint and it 
      will   not   absolve   the   accused   of   his   liability.   Hence   the 
      contention   of   the   accused   that   regular   payment   has   been 
      made   by   him   so   the   complaint   is   not   maintainable   is   not 
      tenable.
</p><p id="p_21">   10.Now,   coming   to   the   second   contention   of   the   accused. 
      Accused has stated that cheque was given as a security cheque 
      as   such   it   was   not   to   be   presented   for   encashment   by   the 
      complainant which is clear form  the  letter  dated  09.09.2003 
      written to the complainant. Perusal of the letter   reveals that 
      the   accused   had   undertaken   to   make   regular   payment   by 
      March,   2004   to   the   complainant   but   statement   of   account 
      reveals  that from  21.06.2002  to 04.09.2004, no  payment  was 
      made   by   the   accused   to   the   complainant   in   that   case   the 
      accused has itself breached the undertaking given in the letter 
      dated 09.09.2003. 
</p><p id="p_22">   11.Before   proceedings   further   it   would   be   useful   to   have     the 
      judgment   of   Hon'ble   High   Court   reported   as   "COLLAGE 
      CULTURE   Vs.   APPAREL   EXPORT   PROMOTION   COUNCIL" 
      reported   in   Crl.   M.C   3011/2004,   wherein   the   Hon'ble   Delhi 
      High court has given the meaning of the security cheque and 

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">CC No. 717/12                                                            Page No. 5</span>
       post dated cheque. The court has observed as follows:­ 
      "20.   A   post   dated   cheque   may   be   issued   under   2 
      circumstances. Under circumstances one, it may be issued for  
      a   debt   in   presenti   but   payable   in   future.   Under   second 
      circumstances it may be issued for a debt which may become  
      payable in future upon the occurence of contingent event. 
</p><p id="p_23">      21.  The  differnce  in  the  two  kinds of post   -  dated cheques 
      would  be  that   the  cheque     issued  under  first  circumstance  
      would be for a debt due, only payment being postponed. The  
      latter cheque would be by way of a security. 
</p><p id="p_24">      22. The word "due' means 'outstanding' at the relevant date'.  
      The debt has to be in existence as a crystallized demand akin  
      to a liquidated damages and not a demand which may or  
      may   not   come   into   existence;   coming   into   existence   being

      the complaint under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_13">Section 138</a> N.I Act is maintainable. In

       view of   the order of DRT dated 21.05.1999, in that case   the

<p id="p_27">   13.As far as the two judgments  i.e "Goa Handicrafts , Rural and 
      Small Scale Industries Development Corporation Ltd Vs. M/s 
      Samundra   Ropes   Pvt.   Ltd   and   others"   reported   in   2005  
      CRI.L.J   4072   (Bombay   High   Court)   and       "M.S   Narayan  
      Menon @ Mani Vs. State of Kerala &amp; Anr. Reported in 2006 III  
      AD (Cri) (S.C)   (Supreme Court)"   relied by the accused they 
      are not applicable in the present case. In that case, accused 
      was   having   running   account   and     its   liability   had   not 
      crystallized when the cheque were issued. On the other hand, 
      in   the   present   case,   at   the   time   of   issuance   of   cheque,   the 
      liability of the accused has crystallized inn view of order of Ld. 
      DRT dated 21.05.1999. Hence, the contention of the accused 
      that the cheque in question was issued as security cheque is 
      not tenable. 
</p><p id="p_28">   14.Now coming to the third contention of the accused that no 
      legal notice was issued to him. The complainant has filed on 
      record Ad card Ex. PW1/8 and UPC Ex. PW1/9. The AD card 
      bears signatures of the receiver and the address mentioned on 
      both AD card and UPC are the correct address of the accused, 
      as stated by him  in the court. In that case, as the letter have 
      been addressed to the correct address, it has to be presumed 
      that   the   same   has   been   received   by   the   accused.   However, 
      even if for the sake of arguments, it is admitted that the legal 
      notice was not delivered to the accused, the accused cannot

       take benefit of the non­delivery of legal notice in view of the 
      judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court reported as "  <a href="/doc/272690/" id="a_14">C.C Alavi 
      Haji V. Palapetty Muhammed Jain</a>. J (2007) 6 SCC, wherein  it 
      was observed as follows:­
      "It is thus, trite to say that where the payee dispatches the 
      notice by registered post with correct address of the drawer of  
      the cheque the principle incorporated in Section 27 of the GC 
      Act   would   be   attracted:   the   requirement   of   clause   (b)   of  
      proviso to <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_15">Section 138</a> of the Act stands complied with and  
      cause of action to file a complaint arises on the expiry of the  
      period   prescribed   in   Clause   (   C)   of   the   said   proviso   for  
      payment by the drawer to show that he had no knowledge 
      that the notice was brought to his address."
</p><p id="p_29">   15.It is further observed that "It is also to be borne in mind that  
      the requirement of giving of notice is a clear departure from  
      the   rule   of   criminal   law,   where   there   is   no   stipulation   of  
      giving of a notice before filing a complaint. Any drawer  who  
      claims that the did not receive the notice sent by post, can,  
      within 15 days of the receipt of the complaint under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_16">section  
      138</a> of  the  Act,  make  payment  within  15 days of receipt  of  
      summons   (by   receiving   a   copy   of   complaint   with   the  
      summons)   and   ,   therefore,   the   complaint   is   liable   to   be  
      rejected.  A  person  who  does  not  pay   within   15   days  of  the  
      receipt of the summons from the court along with the copy of  
      the complaint under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_17">Section 138</a> of the Act, cannot obviously  
      content that there was no proper service of notice as required 
      under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_18">Section 138</a>, by ignoring statutory presumption to the  
      contrary under Section 27 of the GC Act and Section 114 of

</p><p id="p_30">   16.Perusal of the above stated judgment reveals in cases where 
      the   only   defence   raised   by   the   accused   is   that   he   was   not 
      served with the legal notice, in that case, it is essential for the 
      accused to make the payment within 15 days after the receipt 
      of summons. In this case also, the defence which is available 
      with   the   accused   is   that   he   was   not   served   with   the   legal 
      notice.   In   that   case,   in   view   of   the   judgment   of   Hon'ble 
      Supreme   Court   reported   as    C.C   Alavi   Haji   Vs.   Palapetty  
      Muhammed   (SUPRA)                accused   should   have   made   the 
      payment within 15 days of the receipt of the summons but it 
      has failed to do so. There is no other defence available with the 
      accused.   Hence,   this   contention   of   the   accused   is   also   not 
      tenable.
</p><p id="p_31">   17.In the present case, the complainant   has been able to prove 
      that the cheque was issued by the accused and the same has 
      been dishonored and thereafter legal notice has been issued 
      and   no   payment   has   been   made   by   the   accused   to   the 
      complainant.
