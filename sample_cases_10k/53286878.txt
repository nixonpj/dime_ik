<p id="p_4">K. Kannan, J (oral).
</p>
<p id="p_5">                 1.    The    appeal    is   for    enhancement           of

compensation for injury suffered in a motor accident that had resulted

in fracture of nasal bone and fractures in both the legs. The Tribunal

while assessing the compensation provided for medical expenses for

the bills covered and made provision for future expenses at `15,000/-

provided for `5,000/- for attendant charges,transportation charges at

`10,000/- and assessed `20,000/- for pain and suffering and

considered the fact that the disability was 40% and awarded

`30,000/- for disability caused. It assessed total compensation of

`1,02,000/-.
</p>
<p id="p_6">                 2.    The counsel argues that since the fracture
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1"> FAO No. 570 of 1993                               2</span>

was in both legs, future operation was also contemplated.               The

provision for future medical expenses must have been `50,000/- and

for considering the fact of pain and suffering that both the legs were

fractured, she could not have walked and compensation for pain and

suffering must have been high. Loss due to disability must also be

taken as `80,000/-. The provision for non-pecuniary heads like pain

and suffering     or loss of amenities are in some way judicial

approximation. Schedule-II to <a href="/doc/785258/" id="a_1">Motor Vehicles Act</a> is an indication for

assessment. The amendment in law was made in the year 1994.

The compensation assessed towards pain and suffering must be

taken as fairly substantial since the statute provided for only modest

sum of `2500/- for pain and suffering for permanent disability. I am

prepared to however, consider the argument that both legs were

fractured and she would have been immobilized and she could have

suffered enormous pain. The provision for medical expenses in future

cannot be more than what she had already incurred on past

expenses,    for rehabilitation treatment it cannot cause more than

what costed initially. The loss of amenities also would be modestly

increased and I will tabulate all the heads of claim as under:-
