  IN THE HIGH COURT OF KERALA AT ERNAKULAM

WP(C).No. 30515 of 2009(H)


1. ABDUL RAUF, S/O.ABDUL SALAM,
                      ...  Petitioner

                        Vs



1. DISTRICT COLLECTOR, CALICUT.
                       ...       Respondent

2. SUB INSPECTOR OF POLICE,

                For Petitioner  :SRI.P.M.HABEEB

                For Respondent  : No Appearance

The Hon'ble MR. Justice P.N.RAVINDRAN

 Dated :17/11/2009

 O R D E R
                       P.N.RAVINDRAN, J.
                    ---------------------------
                   W.P.(C) No. 30515 OF 2009
                     --------------------------
         Dated this the 17th day of November, 2009

                         J U D G M E N T
</pre>
<p id="p_1">      The petitioner is the registered owner of a tipper lorry

bearing registration No. KL 07 AC 1038. The said vehicle was

seized by the Sub Inspector of Police on 31.5.2009 on the

allegation that it was used to transport river sand without a valid

pass. The District Collector, Calicut, thereafter issued notice to

the petitioner and after hearing him passed an order dated

28.7.2009 ordering confiscation of the vehicle.         The District

Collector however permitted the petitioner to avoid confiscation

by depositing the sum of Rs.1,25,000/- in the river management

fund. Ext.P3 is under challenge in this writ petition.

</p><p id="p_2">      2. The petitioner has no case that the sand transported in

his vehicle was covered by a valid pass. In fact Ext.P3 discloses

that at the time of hearing he had conceded that sand was

transported without a valid pass.      In such circumstances, the

District Collector was right in ordering confiscation of the vehicle.

</p><p id="p_3">      3.   The learned counsel appearing for the petitioner

submits that the value fixed for the petitioner's vehicle is

exorbitant. Ext.P1 discloses that the vehicle was registered on

W.P.(C) No. 30515/09
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                  2</span>

22.11.2000 and that it is a nine year old vehicle. The petitioner

has not however produced any material to show the invoice value

of the vehicle.     He has also not produced any evidence to show

the amount of loan availed by him from the financier. The best

evidence to show the value of the vehicle is the invoice or the

amount of loan taken by the petitioner to purchase the vehicle.

In the absence of any such material, it cannot be said that the

value fixed by the District Collector in Ext.P3 is on the higher

side. I therefore find no merit to interfere with the value fixed in

Ext.P3.       The learned counsel appearing for the petitioner

submitted that the petitioner is depending for his livelihood on

the outcome derived from hiring out the vehicle. He submits that

the petitioner may be permitted to pay the sum of Rs.1,25,000/-

in monthly installments.
</p>
<p id="p_4">      3.    The learned Government Pleader opposes the said

request.     In my opinion, the District Collector or the other

respondents can have no grievance if payment of the sum of

Rs.1,25,000/- is assured.       I accordingly dispose of this writ

petition with the following directions:
</p>
<p id="p_5">      (i) The District Collector, Calicut, shall release the vehicle

W.P.(C) No. 30515/09
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                 3</span>

described in Ext.P3 order to the petitioner in the event of the

petitioner depositing the sum of Rs.50,000/- and furnishing bank

guarantee for the balance sum of Rs.75,000/-. The balance sum

of Rs.75,000/- shall be paid in three equal monthly installments

commencing from 15th December, 2009.
</p>
<p id="p_6">      (ii) If the petitioner does not pay the balance amount as

directed above, on expiry of the time fixed for payment of the

third installment namely 15.3.2010, it will be open to the District

Collector to invoke the bank guarantee and to realise the

proceeds and appropriate it towards the unpaid portion of the

sum of Rs.75,000/-.
</p>
<p id="p_7">      (iii) If the petitioner remits the installments in time, the

bank guarantee shall be returned to the petitioner on 15.3.2010

itself or immediately thereafter. The balance amount if any shall

in that event be refunded to the petitioner.
</p>
