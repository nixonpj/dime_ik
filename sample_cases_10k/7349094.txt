i) Brief statement of the reasons for the decision :



1.</pre><p id="p_1">    Vide this judgment, the Court shall decide the complaint case under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_1">Section 138</a>

Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (herein after referred to as <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_2">NI Act</a>) filed by the

complainant Carzonrent India (Pvt) Ltd. through its AR against the accused Sri Bhagan.



</p><p id="p_2">2.    Briefly stated, the averments of the complaint are that the accused approached

the complainant and showed his willingness to join the EASY CAB project launched by

the complainant. It has been alleged that a cab bearing registration no.DL-1RX-6088

was entrusted by the complainant to the accused upon certain terms and conditions for

the purpose of plying the same on hire basis. Allegedly, the accused was bound to pay

a consideration amount of Rs.750/- per day to the complainant in this regard. The

accused allegedly issued two cheques bearing no. 137845 dt.06.06.2007 for an amount

of Rs.13,000/- and no. 137846 dt.11.06.2007 for an amount of Rs.2000/- respectively,

both drawn on Punjab National Bank, in favour of the complainant company towards

discharge of his liability aforesaid.   However, the said cheques were returned

dishonored on being presented for encashment by the complainant due to the reason

"Funds Insufficient" vide return memo dt. 09.06.2007 and 14.06.2007, received by the

complainant on 12.06.2007 and 15.06.2007. The complainant thereafter got issued a

legal demand notice dt. 22.06.2007 through registered AD and UPC upon the accused.


</p><p id="p_3">CC No.3146/1/09                                                          Page no. 2 of 10
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                               3</span>

Despite the expiry of the stipulated period in this regard, the accused failed to make the

payment of the cheque amount in question and hence, the present complaint case was

filed on 08.08.2007 for the offence u/s 138 <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_3">Negotiable Instruments Act</a>.



</p><p id="p_4">3.    The accused was summoned by Ld. Predecessor, vide order dated 14.08.2007

and notice of the accusation for the offence punishable u/s 138 <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_4">N.I. Act</a> was put to the

accused vide order dated 09.05.2013, to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed trial.



</p><p id="p_5">4.    In order to prove the allegations levelled by him against the accused, the

complainant examined its AR as CW1. He tendered his evidence by way of affidavit

Ex.CW1/A, wherein he stated the contents of his complaint on oath before the Court and

relied upon the documents Ex.C-1 to Ex.C-11.
</p>
<p id="p_6">

</p><p id="p_7">5.    The CE was thereafter closed vide order dt.25.01.2014 and the statement of

accused was recorded u/s 313 read with <a href="/doc/224316/" id="a_5">section 281</a> CrPC, vide order dt.17.04.2014,

wherein the entire incriminating evidence was put to the accused and the latter wished

to lead DE.    The accused failed to examine any defence witness hence DE was

thereafter closed vide order dt.21.05.2014.

</p><p id="p_12">7.    Following Points arise for determination by this court :

</p><p id="p_13">            (1)   Whether the complainant has proved on record the essential

ingredients of offence under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_6">Section 138</a> of Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 against

the accused.
</p>
<p id="p_14">            (2)   Final order.
</p>
<p id="p_15">

</p><p id="p_16">8.          Point No. (1) - To decide this point, lets analyze the main ingredients

of Provision 138 of <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_7">Negotiable Instrument Act</a>, 1881 and the evidence on record

regarding these ingredients : -
</p>
<p id="p_17">            (a)   Whether the cheque was drawn/issued by the accused person to

the complainant on an account maintained by him with the bank for discharge, in

whole or in part, of any debt or other liability?
</p>
<p id="p_18">            (b)   Whether the cheque was presented to the bank within a period

of six months or within the period of its validity?
</p>
<p id="p_19">            (c)   Whether the cheque so presented for encashment was

dishonored?
</p>
<p id="p_20">            (d)   Whether the payee/complainant of the cheque issued a Legal

Demand Notice within 30 days from the receipt of information from the bank

regarding dishonourment of the cheque?
</p>
<p id="p_21">            (e)   Whether drawer of the cheque failed to make the payment within

15 days of receipt of afore-said Legal Demand Notice?
</p>
<p id="p_22">CC No.3146/1/09                                                       Page no. 4 of 10
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                             5</span>



</p><p id="p_23">9.    It is pertinent to mention here that the complainant has to prove all the abovesaid

ingredients simultaneously on record to bring home the conviction of the accused.



</p><p id="p_24">10.   In this case, the complainant has brought on record the certificate of incorporation

as Ex.CW1/1, Extract of Board Resolution as Ex.CW1/2 and Power of Attorney in favour

of the AR as Ex.CW1/3. The cheques in question bearing no.137845, dt.06.06.2007 and

bearing no.137846 dt. 11.06.2007 both drawn on Punjab National Bank Trinagar Branch,

Delhi, issued by the accused in the favour of the complainant have been brought on

record as Ex.CW1/4 and          Ex.CW1/5.       It has been further contended that on

presentation, the said cheques were returned dishonored vide cheque returning memo

brought on record as Ex.CW1/6, Ex.CW1/7, Ex.CW1/8 and Ex.CW1/9 due to reason of

"Funds Insufficient". The complainant has further deposed in his affidavit that upon the

receipt of information regarding the dishonored cheque in question, he sent a legal

demand notice to the accused brought on record as Ex.C-10, vide Postal Receipt

Ex.C-11, thereby demanding payment of cheque amount in question within 15 days of

receipt of notice. It has been further deposed in his affidavit by the complainant that the

accused has not made the payment qua cheque in question till date, despite service of

legal demand notice as abovesaid.

<p id="p_25">

</p><p id="p_26">11.         As per the oral submissions, notice under <a href="/doc/429078/" id="a_8">Section 251</a> Cr. P.C., statement

CC No.3146/1/09                                                             Page no. 5 of 10

of accused under <a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_9">Section 313</a> Cr. P.C. r/w <a href="/doc/224316/" id="a_10">Section 281</a> Cr. P.C. and evidence brought on

record, the accused has raised two major defences in this case : -

</p><p id="p_27">                   1.) that he had no legal liability towards the complainant and the

cheques in question were given as security.
</p>
<p id="p_28">                   2.) and that he did not receive any legal demand notice.
</p>
<p id="p_29">

</p><p id="p_30">12.   In the present case, the complainant has contended that the accused had issued

the impugned cheques towards discharge of his part liability to the complainant on

account of agreement between the parties for plying the taxi on hire basis. On the other

hand, the accused has contended that the cheque in question were issued as security

only and there was no liability as alleged by the complainant. Herein, it is to be noted

that the complainant has neither brought on record the alleged agreement between the

parties stipulating payment of the said hire charges and the rate thereof, nor the

complainant has brought on record any statement of account showing the exact and

specific liability, if any, of the accused. The complainant witness has specifically admitted

about the failure to bring such documents on record and has even admitted during his

cross-examination that the cheques in question were given blank by the accused to the

complainant and were given as security. The CW1 has also admitted that the security

amount in cash for an amount on Rs.11,000/- was also received by the complainant and

the same has not been returned by the complainant to the accused as it has been

adjusted towards the outstanding amount. However, in absence of any statement of

CC No.3146/1/09                                                               Page no. 6 of 10
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                              7</span>

account showing such adjustment as aforesaid, the contention of the complainant

regarding liability of the accused for the cheques amount in question can not be

accepted on its face value alone.
</p>
<p id="p_31">

</p><p id="p_32">13.    In such cases, the position of the Law has very much been settled by the Hon'ble

Supreme Court in its decision titled as "Rangappa Vs. Sri Mohan", 2010 11 SCC 441.

In    the said judgment, the full bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that

"Inference of preponderance of probabilities can be drawn not only from the materials

brought on record by the parties but also by reference to the circumstances upon which

he relies". The Hon'ble Supreme Court has reiterated the position of the Law laid down

in "Hiten P. Dalal V s. Bratindranath Banerjee ",(2001)6 SCC16, wherein it has been

held that "the obligation of the prosecution may be discharged with the help of

presumptions of law or fact unless the accused adduces evidence showing the

reasonable probability of the non-existence of the presumed fact". Finally, the Hon'ble

Supreme Court has also held and reiterated its earlier decision in "Bharat Barrel &amp;

Drum Manufacturing Company V s. Amin Chand Pyarelal", (1993)3 SCC35, wherein

it has been held that the "the bare denial of the passing of the consideration apparently

does not appear to be any defence. Something which is probable has to be brought on

record for getting the benefit of shifting the onus of proving to the plaintiff. To disprove

the presumption, the defendant has to bring on record such facts and circumstances

upon consideration of which the Court may either believe that the consideration did not

CC No.3146/1/09                                                              Page no. 7 of 10
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                              8</span>

exist or its non-existence was so probable that a prudent man would, under the

circumstances of the case, act upon the plea that it did not exist"



</p><p id="p_33">14.   Therefore, in absence of any evidence to establish the liability of the accused for

the cheque amount in question, the Court has no hesitation in hereby arriving at the

finding that the complainant case has failed to stand upon its own legs. There are

credible and reasonable doubts in the version of the complainant and hence, the

defence of the accused regarding absence of liability is hereby accepted.



</p><p id="p_34">15.   Now, coming to the second defence of the accused as to the non receiving of the

legal notice Ex.CW1/10 by him, it is to be noted that the legal demand notice Ex.CW1/10

has been sent by the complainant vide registered postal receipt Ex.CW1/11, to the

accused on the same address which has been admitted to be his correct address by the

accused in his statement u/s 313 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_11">CrPC</a>. Hence, the same is thus a valid legal demand

notice sent by the complainant to the accused and the position of the Law has been

specifically enunciated by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in "C. C. Alavi Hazi Vs.

Palapetty Mohd. &amp; Anr." reported in (2007) 6 Supreme Court Cases 555. In the said

case, the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India has held that : -
</p>
<p id="p_35">             "Any drawer who claims that he did not received the notice sent by post,

can, within 15 days of receipt of summons from the court in respect of complaint

Under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_12">Section 138</a> of the Act, make the payment of the cheque amount and

CC No.3146/1/09                                                             Page no. 8 of 10
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                             9</span>

submit to the court that he had made the payment within 15 days of the receipt of

summons (by receiving a copy of complaint with the summons) and, therefore,

the complainant is liable to be rejected. A person who does not pay within 15

days of receipt of summons from the court along-with the copy of complaint

Under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_13">Section 138</a> of the Act, can not obviously contend that there was no proper

service of notice as required Under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_14">Section 138</a>, by ignoring statutory presumption to

the contrary Under Section 27 of G. C. Act and 114 of the <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_15">Evidence Act</a>."



</p><p id="p_36">16.   In view of the aforesaid discussion, the Court has no hesitation in hereby arriving

at the finding that the accused has failed to rebutt the presumption as envisaged u/s 118

read with <a href="/doc/268919/" id="a_16">section 139</a> NI Act and the defence of the accused is highly superfluous,

improbable and concocted one. Thus, the said defence of the accused stands rejected

accordingly.
</p>
<p id="p_37">

</p><p id="p_38">(ii) Final order :­



</p><p id="p_39">17.   In view of the aforesaid discussion, the Court has no hesitation in arriving at the
