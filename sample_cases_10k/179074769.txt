                  R/CR.MA/11804/2017                                                   ORDER




</pre><p id="p_6">         5.           This Court has heard the learned Advocates appearing
         for the respective parties and perused the investigation papers and
         have also taken into consideration the facts of the case. The only
         slander evidence against the applicant is that he was present in the
         field with the liquor worth Rs.61,200/- and upon noticing the police
         party raiding the said open filed; ran away.                        The Investigating
         Officer has given the complaint wherein the statement is made that
         the accused had run away; then he himself investigated the case.
         Thus,   in   absence         of   independent        evidence         establishing         the
         conscious possession of the liquor with the applicant, the bail to the
         applicant is required to be granted at this stage. Thus, considering
         the nature of allegations, role attributed to the applicant-accused
         and without discussing the evidence in detail, at this stage, this
         Court is inclined to grant anticipatory bail to the applicant.
</p>

<p id="p_7">         6.           Learned Advocate for the applicant on instructions
         states that the applicant is ready and willing to abide by all the
         conditions, including impositions of conditions with regard to the
         powers of Investigating Agency to file an application before the
         competent court for his remand.                   He would further submit that
         upon filing of such application by the Investigating Agency, the
         right of applicant accused to oppose such application on merits
         may be kept open.
</p>

<p id="p_8">         7.           In the result, this application is allowed. It is directed
         that in the event of arrest of the applicant herein in connection
         with FIR registered at C.R. No.I-82 of 2017 at Bahucharaji
         Police Station, Mehsana, the applicant shall be released on bail
         on his furnishing a personal bond of Rs.10,000/- (Rupees ten

                     the Trial Court within a week; and

</p><p id="p_15">                     (g) it would be open to the Investigating Officer to file
                     an application for remand if he considers it proper and
                     just and the learned Magistrate would decide the same
                     on merits;
</p>

<p id="p_16">         9.          Despite         this   order,        it   would       be     open       for     the
         Investigating Agency to apply to the competent Magistrate, for
         Police remand of the applicant. The applicant shall remain present
         before the learned Magistrate on the first date of hearing of such
         application and on all subsequent occasions, as may be directed by
         the learned Magistrate. This would be sufficient to treat the
         accused in the judicial custody for the purpose of entertaining
         application of the prosecution for police remand. This is, however,
         without prejudice to the right of the accused to seek stay against
         an order of remand, if, ultimately, granted, and the power of the
         learned Magistrate to consider such a request in accordance with
         law. It is clarified that the applicant, even if, remanded to the
         Police custody, upon completion of such period of Police remand,
