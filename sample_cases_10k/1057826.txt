ACT:
Thika  tenant-Decree for ejectment-Execution  application-If
lies  in  civil	 Court-Welfaye	 legislation-Interpretation-
Calcutta Thika Tenancy Act, 1949 (W.B. 11 Of 1949), s. 5(1).



HEADNOTE:
Respondent  obtained  a	 decree for  ejectment	against	 the
appellant,  a  thika tenant, and filed	an  application	 for
execution  of the decree before the civil Court.   Appellant
resisted  the application on the ground that in view  Of  s.
5(1)  Of  the Calcutta Thika Tenancy Act,  1949,  the  civil
Court  had  no jurisdiction to	entertain  the	application.
Section	 5(1)  provides that a landlord wishing to  eject  a
thika tenant on the grounds specified in s. 3 shall apply to
the Controller in that behalf.
Held that S. 5(1) did not apply to a case where the landlord
had  already  obtained a decree for  ejectment	against	 his
thika	tenant	 and  consequently  the	 civil	 Court	 had
jurisdiction to entertain the execution application.
The  operative	provisions  of	welfare	 legislation  should
receive a beneficent construction from the Courts.  But	 the
words  used in a statute must be interpreted in their  plain
grammatical  meaning  and  it is only when  such  words	 are
capable	 of two constructions that the question of  adopting
the construction which is more consistent with the policy of
the Act arises.
Heydon's Case, (1584) 3 Co. Rep. 8, referred to.

</p><p id="p_4">1957 September 10.  The following Judgment of the Court	 was
delivered by
GAJENDRAGADKAR	J.-This	 is an appeal by  special  leave  in
execution   proceedings	 and  the  short  point	 which	 the
appellant  has raised before us is that, under s. 5  (1)  of
the  Calcutta  Thika Tenancy Act, 1949 (West  Bengal  II  of
1949)  as amended by the Calcutta Thika Tenancy	 (Amendment)
Act,  1953 (West Bengal VI of 1953),  execution	 proceedings
taken  out by the decrees against him could  be	 entertained
only  by the controller and not by the civil  courts.	This
point  arises in this way.  The appellant is a thika  tenant
in  respect of a portion of the premises No. 28, R.  G.	 Kar
Road  in  Calcutta.   In Suit No. 46 of 1948  a	 decree	 for
ejectment  was	passed	against him and	 in  favour  of	 the
respondent on March 16, 1949.  This decree was challenged by
the  appellant by preferring an appeal before  the  District
Court and a second appeal before the High Court at Calcutta;
but  both those appeals failed and the decree for  ejectment
passed	by  the trial court was	 confirmed.   Then  followed
several	 proceedings between the parties and the  course  of
litigation  between  them turned out to	 be  protracted	 and
tortuous.  Ultimately on May 22, 1953, the respondent  filed
an execution case before the First Additional Court, Sealdah
(Title Execution Case No. 34 of 1953).	By this	 application
the  respondent claimed that the possession of the  property
covered by the decree should be delivered to him.  Thereupon
the  appellant filed a Miscellaneous Judicial Case under  s.
47  of	the  Code of Civil Procedure in	 the  court  raising
several	 objections  to	 the  decree	holder's  claim	  for
execution (Miscellaneous
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">362</span>
Judicial  Case No. 96 of 1953).	 This case was dismissed  by
the  executing court on February 2, 1954.   A  miscellaneous
appeal	preferred  by  the  appellant  before  the   learned
District   Judge,  24-Parganas,	 as  well  as	the   second
miscellaneous appeal preferred by him before the High  Court
at  Calcutta  were likewise dismissed.	The  appellant	then
applied	 for  leave to prefer an appeal	 under	the  Letters
Patent.	  This	application  was  rejected  by	Mr.  Justice
Renupada Mukherjee who had heard the second appeal.  On	 May
10,  1955, the appellant filed a petition for special  leave
to appeal to this Court and special leave was granted to him
on  May	 18,  1955.  The courts below  have  held  that	 the
decree-holder's	 application  for execution  of	 the  decree
passed in his favour can and ought to be entertained by	 the
civil  courts  and  an order has  been	passed	against	 the
appellant  that	 he should vacate the premises	in  question
before	the  end of Jaistha 1362 B.S. (1  5th  June,  1955),
failing which execution will proceed according to law.	 The
appellant's contention is that the view taken by the  courts
below about the competence of the civil courts to  entertain
the  decree-holder's  execution application  proceeds  on  a
misconstruction	 of s. 5 (1) of the Calcutta  Thika  Tenancy
Act.   That  is how the only question which arises  for	 our
decision  is  about the construction of	 the  said  relevant
section.
</p><p id="p_5">Before	dealing	 with  this point, it  would  be  useful  to
consider  briefly the history of legislation passed  by	 the
West  Bengal  Legislature  with	 the  object  of   affording
protection to the thika tenants.  Until 1948 the rights	 and
liabilities  of the landlords and their thika  tenants	were
governed by the provisions of the <a href="/doc/515323/" id="a_1">Transfer of Property	Act</a>.
On October 26, 1948, the Calcutta Thika Tenancy Ordinance XI
of  1948, was promulgated because it was thought  expedient,
pending the enactment of appropriate legislation to  provide
for  the temporary stay of the execution of certain  decrees
and  orders  of	 ejectment of  thika  tenants  in  Calcutta.
<a href="/doc/1637824/" id="a_2">Section	 2</a>  of	the  Ordinance	defined	 the  thika  tenant.
<a href="/doc/858315/" id="a_3">Section 3</a> provided that no decree or order for the ejectment
of  a thika tenant shall be executed during the	 continuance
in operation of the Ordinance, From the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">363</span>
operation  of this section were excluded decrees  or  orders
for ejectment passed against, thika tenants on the ground of
non-payment  of rent unless the tenants deposited  in  court
the  amount  of	 the  decree or order  as  required  by	 the
proviso.  The object of the Ordinance clearly appears to  be
to  give protection to the thika tenants in Calcutta and  to
afford them interim' relief by staying execution of  certain
decrees and orders as mentioned in<a href="/doc/858315/" id="a_4"> s. 3</a> until an appropriate
Act was passed by the Legislature in that behalf.
Then followed Act II of 1949 on February 28, 1949.   <a href="/doc/1637824/" id="a_5">Section
2</a>, sub-s. (5) of this Act defines a thika tenant.  <a href="/doc/858315/" id="a_6">Section 3</a>
lays  down  the	 grounds  on which a  thika  tenant  may  be
ejected.   The	effect of this section is that	it  is	only
where  one or more of the six grounds recognized by<a href="/doc/858315/" id="a_7"> s. 3</a>  is
proved	against a thika tenant that a decree  for  ejectment
against	 him can be passed.  In other words,  grounds  other
than those mentioned in<a href="/doc/858315/" id="a_8"> s. 3</a> on which a landlord would	have
been entitled to eject his thika tenant under the provisions
of  the <a href="/doc/515323/" id="a_9">Transfer of Property Act</a> became inapplicable to	 the
case of the thika tenants by virtue of<a href="/doc/1345438/" id="a_10"> s. 3</a>. <a href="/doc/1272508/" id="a_11">Section 5</a>, sub-
s. (1) reads thus:
</p><p id="p_6">"S.  5. (1) Notwithstanding anything contained in any  other
law for the time being in force, a landlord wishing to eject
a  thika tenant on one or more of the grounds  specified  in
<a href="/doc/1345438/" id="a_12">section	 3</a>  shall  apply in the	 prescribed  manner  to	 the
Controller  for an order in that behalf and, on	 receipt  of
such  application,  the Controller shall, after	 giving	 the
thika tenant a notice to show cause within thirty days	from
the date of service of the notice why the application  shall
not be allowed and after making an inquiry in the prescribed
manner	either	allow  the application or  reject  it  after
recording  the	reasons for making such order,	and,  if  he
allows	the application, shall make an order  directing	 the
thika  tenant  to  vacate the holding and,  subject  to	 the
provisions of <a href="/doc/576368/" id="a_13">section 10</a>, to put the landlord in  possession
thereof."
</p><p id="p_7">This  section  requires the landlord wishing  to  eject	 his
thika tenant on one or more of the grounds specified in<a href="/doc/1345438/" id="a_14"> s.   3</a>
to apply in the prescribed manner to the Controller
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">47</span>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">364</span>
for an order in that behalf.  This section further  provides
for  the  procedure  to be followed  by	 the  Controller  in
dealing	 with  such an application.  Two other	sections  of
this Act need to be considered.	 <a href="/doc/1898852/" id="a_15">Section 28</a> deals with cases
where  decrees or orders for the recovery of  possession  of
any holding from a thika tenant have been passed before	 the
date of the commencement of the Act and it lays down that if
</p><p id="p_8">-possession  has not been obtained by the  decree-holder  in
execution  of such decrees or orders the court may  consider
whether	 the  decree or order in question is or	 is  not  in
conformity with any of the provisions of the Act other	than
subs.  (1)  of<a href="/doc/1272508/" id="a_16"> s. 5</a> or<a href="/doc/1629541/" id="a_17"> s. 27</a>.  On  considering	this  matter
jurisdiction  is given to the court to rescind or  vary	 the
decree or the order for the purpose of giving effect to	 the
relevant  provisions  of  this Act.  A decree  or  order  so
varied	has then to be sent to the Controller for  execution
as if it were an order made under and in accordance with the
provisions  of the Act.	 Having thus dealt with decrees	 and
orders	for ejectment passed against thika tenants prior  to
the  commencement of this Act,<a href="/doc/1600183/" id="a_18"> s. 29</a> proceeds to  deal	with
pending, proceedings for ejectment between the landlords and
the thika tenants.  This section lays down that all  pending
proceedings  of this character shall be transferred  to	 the
Controller who shall thereupon deal with them in  accordance
with  the provisions of this Act as if this Act had been  in
operation  on  the date of the institution of  the  suit  or
proceeding.   The  proviso  to	this  section  exempts	 the
application  of	<a href="/doc/875838/" id="a_19"> s. 4</a> of this Act to  such  proceedings	 for
obvious reasons.
</p><p id="p_9">It  appears  that  the definition of  the  expression  thika
tenant " contained in the Act gave rise to some difficulties
and  it was discovered that some of the tenants in  Calcutta
who  were  in substance thika tenants failed to	 obtain	 the
protection  of the Act owing to some words used in the	said
definition.   In  order to afford protection  to  the  whole
class  of thika tenants in Calcutta, West  Bengal  Ordinance
No.  XV	 of  1952  was	promulgated  on	 October  21,  1952.
Accordingly,<a href="/doc/1920937/" id="a_20"> s. 2</a> of this Ordinance amended<a href="/doc/1920937/" id="a_21"> s. 2</a>, sub-s. (5)
of  the Calcutta Thika Tenancy Act II of 1949.	This is	 one
important
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">365</span>
change	introduced by this Ordinance.  The  other  important
change	introduced by this Ordinance is to be found in<a href="/doc/858315/" id="a_22"> s.  5</a>
of the Ordinance.  <a href="/doc/858315/" id="a_23">Section 5</a>, sub-s. (1) lays down that	 all
cases  pending before a court or Controller on the  date  of
the commencement of this Ordinance shall be governed by	 the
provisions of Act II of 1949, as amended by this  Ordinance.
Sub-section (2) of<a href="/doc/858315/" id="a_24"> s. 5</a> then deals with cases where  decrees
or orders have been passed for the recovery of possession at
any  time between the commencement of the said Act and	this
Ordinance.   In	 the present appeal, we are dealing  with  a
decree falling under<a href="/doc/858315/" id="a_25"> s. 5</a>, sub-s. (2) of this Ordinance.  In
respect of such decrees this sub-section lays down that	 the
judgment-debtor	 could	apply  within three  months  of	 the
commencement of the Ordinance to the court or the Controller
as  the case may be and invite his decision on the  question
of  his status as thika tenant; according to the  provisions
of  this subsection, the status of the judgment-debtor as  a
thika  tenant  would then have to be  determined  under	 the
amended definition of the expression "thika tenant".  If the
finding	 on  the  question of status is	 in  favour  of	 the
judgment-debtor	 then the decree or order would have  to  be
set aside and execution proceedings annulled, and the matter
sent  back  to	the  court or  Controller  for	disposal  in
accordance  with  law.	Subsection (3) of<a href="/doc/858315/" id="a_26"> s. 5</a>	enables	 the
court  or  the Controller to stay proceedings,	if  any,  in
execution pending the disposal of an application made  under
sub-s. (2).  In other words, the effect of sub-s. (2) of <a href="/doc/858315/" id="a_27"> s.
5</a>  clearly appears to be that, in regard to  decrees  passed
during the period mentioned by this subsection, a  judgment-
debt-or	 was given a right to challenge the validity of	 the
said  decree  or  order on the ground that he  was  a  thika
tenant	under the amended definition of the said  expression
and  this right could be exercised by making an	 appropriate
application  within the prescribed period of  three  months.
If no such application is made by the judgment-debtor within
the  prescribed	 period,  then	the  decree  or	 order	 for
ejectment  passed  against him would be executed  under	 the
ordinary law.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">366</span>
<p id="p_10">This  Ordinance was followed by the Calcutta  Thika  Tenancy
(Amendment)  Act, 1953 (West Bengal VI of 1953).   <a href="/doc/858315/" id="a_28">This	 Act</a>
came  into force immediately on the Calcutta  Thika  Tenancy
(Amendment) Ordinance, 1952 (West Bengal Ordinance No. XV of
1952), ceasing to operate.  Under the proviso to<a href="/doc/1383252/" id="a_29"> s. 1</a>,	sub-
s.  (2)	 of this Act, the provisions of the  Calcutta  Thika
Tenancy	 Act II of 1949, as amended by this Act, shall	also
apply  and be deemed to always apply to all  suits,  appeals
and  proceedings  pending  before any court  or	 before	 the
Controller or before a person deciding an appeal under<a href="/doc/858315/" id="a_30"> s. 27</a>
of  this  Act on the date of the commencement  of  the	said
Ordinance  of  1952.  It must, however, be added  that	this
proviso	 was subject to the provisions of<a href="/doc/858315/" id="a_31"> s. 9</a> of this	Act.
We  will  presently  refer to<a href="/doc/858315/" id="a_32"> s. 9</a>. <a href="/doc/1637824/" id="a_33">Section 2</a>  of  this	 Act
adopted the amendment of the definition of the expression, "
thika tenancy" introduced by the amending Ordinance of 1952.
<a href="/doc/858315/" id="a_34">Section 4</a> of this amending Act has amended a. 5, sub-s.	 (1)
of  the original Act by deleting the words "but	 subject  to
the provisions of<a href="/doc/858315/" id="a_35"> s. 28</a>" which occurred in the said section.
By s.8 of this Act,<a href="/doc/858315/" id="a_36"> ss. 28</a> and <a href="/doc/858315/" id="a_37">29</a> in the original Act II  of
1949 have been omitted and by a. 9 it is laid down that	 any
proceedings  commenced	under  sub-s. (2) of <a href="/doc/858315/" id="a_38"> s.  5</a>  of	 the
amending  Ordinance  of 1952 shall, on	the  said  Ordinance
ceasing	 to operate be continued as if sub-ss. (2), (3)	 and
(4)  of	 that section and the explanations to  that  section
were  in  force.   It  would thus  appear  that	 though	 the
Ordinance  ceased to be operative the remedy provided by <a href="/doc/858315/" id="a_39"> s.
5</a>, sub-s. (2) of the Ordinance to judgment-debtors continued
to be available to them and the applications made by them to
seek.  the protection of the said provision bad to be  dealt
with as if the material provisions of the Ordinance were  in
operation.  It is true that<a href="/doc/858315/" id="a_40"> s. 9</a> of the amending Act has not
been  incorporated in the original Act II of 1949 but it  is
conceded  that the omission to include this section  in	 the
original Act does not make any difference.
Mr. N. C. Chatterjee, for the appellant, has contended	that
the object in enacting the relevant
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">367</span>
Thika  Tenancy Acts and Ordinances is absolutely clear.	  It
is a piece of welfare legislation and as such its  operative
provisions  should receive a beneficient  construction	from
the  courts.   If  the	scheme of the  Act  and	 the  object
underlying  it	is to afford full protection  to  the  thika
tenants, says Mr. Chatterjee, courts should be slow to reach
the conclusion that any class of thika tenants are  excluded
from the benefit of the said Act.  In	 support   of	 his
argument   Mr.	 Chatterjee  hasnaturally  relied   on	 the
observations  made  by Barons of the Exchequer	in  Heydon's
case  (1).Indeed these observations have been so  frequently
cited  with approval by courts administering  provisions  of
welfare enactments that they have now attained the status of
a  classic  on	the subject and	 their	validity  cannot  be
challenged.  However, in applying these observations to	 the
provisions  of any statute, it must always be borne in	mind
that the first and primary rule of construction is that	 the
intention of the Legislature must be found in the words used
by the Legislature itself.  If the words used are capable of
one  construction  only	 then it would not be  open  to	 the
courts	to adopt any other hypothetical construction on	 the
ground	 that	such  hypothetical  construction   is	more
consistent  with the alleged object and policy of  the	Act.
The  words  used in the material provisions of	the  statute
must  be interpreted in their plain grammatical meaning	 and
it is only when such words are capable of two  constructions
that  the question of giving effect to the policy or  object
of the Act can legitimately arise.  When the material  words
are capable of two constructions, one of which is likely  to
defeat	or  impair the policy of the Act  whilst  the  other
construction is likely to assist the achievement of the said
policy,	 then  the courts would prefer to adopt	 the  latter
construction.	It  is only in such cases  that	 it  becomes
relevant to consider the mischief and defect which the,	 Act
purports  to  remedy  and correct.   Indeed  Mr.  Chatterjee
himself	 fairly conceded that be would not be  justified  in
asking the court to put an undue strain on the words used in
the section in order
(1)  (1584) 3 Co. Rep. 8.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">368</span>
<p id="p_11">that  a construction favourable to the thika tenants  should
be deduced.  It is in the light of this legal position	that
we must now consider<a href="/doc/858315/" id="a_41"> s. 5</a>, sub-s. (1) of <a href="/doc/688958/" id="a_42">West Bengal Act</a>  II
of 1949, amended by <a href="/doc/688958/" id="a_43">West Bengal Act</a> VI of 1953.
Under  the provisions of<a href="/doc/858315/" id="a_44"> ss. 5</a> and <a href="/doc/858315/" id="a_45">28</a> of the  original	<a href="/doc/688958/" id="a_46">West
Bengal	Act</a>  II	 of  1949, the position	 was  clear.   If  a
landlord  wished to eject his tenant he could have  obtained
an  order for ejectment only if his claim was  justified  on
one  or more of the grounds recognized by<a href="/doc/1944156/" id="a_47"> s. 3</a> of  the	Act.
If,  after the commencement of the Act, the landlord  wanted
to enforce his claim for ejectment, he had to apply for	 the
said  relief  before  the  Controller  under <a href="/doc/216843/" id="a_48"> s.  5</a>  in	 the
prescribed manner.  The application of<a href="/doc/216843/" id="a_49"> s. 5</a>, sub-s. (1) was,
however,  subject  to the provisions of<a href="/doc/688958/" id="a_50"> s. 28</a>.	As  we	have
already	 pointed  out,<a href="/doc/688958/" id="a_51"> s. 28</a> dealt with	 decrees  or  orders
already	  passed  whereas <a href="/doc/688958/" id="a_52"> s.  29</a>  dealt  with	 suits	 and
proceedings  pending  at the commencement of the  Act.	 The
appellant's  contention is that the effect of<a href="/doc/216843/" id="a_53"> ss. 5</a>, <a href="/doc/688958/" id="a_54">28</a>	 and
<a href="/doc/688958/" id="a_55">29</a>  was to submit the claims of landlords for  ejectment  of
the  thika  tenants  to	 a scrutiny  in	 the  light  of	 the
provisions  of<a href="/doc/1944156/" id="a_56"> s. 3</a> and other relevant sections of the	Act.
Whether the claim had merged in a decree or was pending in a
proceeding  at the time when the Act came into force  or  it
was  made after the commencement of the Act, in	 every	case
the  test  laid	 down by<a href="/doc/1944156/" id="a_57"> s. 3</a> had to  be  applied;  and	 the
argument  is  that/  this position is  not  altered  by	 the
amendments  made  by Act VI of 1953.  In our  opinion,	this
argument  cannot be accepted.  <a href="/doc/1944156/" id="a_58">Section 3</a> clearly  refers  to
the claim for ejectment made by the landlord in a proceeding
instituted  by him.  It is difficult to understand how<a href="/doc/1944156/" id="a_59"> s.  3</a>
could  be  invoked  against a landlord who  has	 obtained  a
decree for ejectment of his thika tenant.  It is quite plain
that when a decree-holder seeks to obtain possession of	 his
property  in  execution	 of a decree he cannot	be  said  to
obtain such possession on any of the grounds mentioned in s.
</p><p id="p_12">3.  All that he does is to rely upon the decree passed by  a
court  of  competent  jurisdiction and to  insist  upon	 its
execution.  Similarly the proceedings contemplated by<a href="/doc/216843/" id="a_60"> s.  5</a>,
sub-s. (1), cannot in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">369</span>
our  opinion,  be said to include execution  proceedings  of
this type.  <a href="/doc/216843/" id="a_61">Section 5</a>, sub-s. (1) deals with cases where the
landlord  initiates  original proceedings for  ejecting	 his
thika tenant.  This sub-section refers to a landlord wishing
to  eject  a  thika tenant on one or  more  of	the  grounds
specified   in	s.  3.	Now  this  description	 is   wholly
inapplicable to a landlord who holds' a decree for ejectment
in his favour.	That is why we feel no hesitation in  coming
to  the conclusion that landlords who have obtained  decrees
of ejectment against their thika tenants cannot be  required
to  apply  under the provisions of<a href="/doc/216843/" id="a_62"> s. 5</a>, sub-s. (1)  of	 the
Act.   That  is	 one  aspect  of  the  matter.	 The   other
provisions  of the said sub-section also point to  the	same
conclusion.  When an application for ejectment is made under
s.  5,	sub-s. (1), notice is ordered to be  issued  to	 the
thika  tenant and enquiry follows in the light of  the	pro-
visions	 of<a href="/doc/1944156/" id="a_63"> s. 3</a>. It is only if the Controller is  satisfied
that one or more of the grounds recognized by<a href="/doc/1944156/" id="a_64"> s. 3</a> is proved
by the landlord that an order for ejectment would be  passed
by  him and this order would be followed by a  direction  in
consequence of which the landlord would be put in possession
of the premises.  <a href="/doc/216843/" id="a_65">Section 5</a>, sub-s. (1) thus provides for  a
self  contained procedure for dealing with applications	 for
ejectment made by a landlord against his thika tenant before
the Controller.
</p><p id="p_13">Mr.  Chatterjee, however, suggests that the deletion of	 the
words  "  subject  to  the  provisions	of <a href="/doc/688958/" id="a_66"> s.	28</a>  "  which
originally  occurred in<a href="/doc/216843/" id="a_67"> s. 5</a> indicates that  the  Controller
has  been given jurisdiction not only to entertain  original
applications for ejectment made by the landlords but also to
deal  with decrees already passed in their favour.   Whether
or not the use of the deleted words in the original<a href="/doc/216843/" id="a_68"> s. 5</a> (1)
served	any  useful  purpose  and  what	 exactly  was  their
denotation  are	 matters  on  which  it	 is  unnecessary  to
pronounce a judgment in the present case.  It is clear	that
since <a href="/doc/688958/" id="a_69"> s. 28</a> along with<a href="/doc/688958/" id="a_70"> s. 29</a> has been deleted from the	 Act
by the subsequent amending Act VI of 1953, any reference  to
s. 28 in<a href="/doc/216843/" id="a_71"> s. 5</a> (1) would have been entirely out of  place.But
the deletion of the material words does not enlarge the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">370</span>
jurisdiction  of the Controller to reopen  disputes  between
the  landlords	and their thika tenants when in	 respect  of
such disputes decrees have already been passed by courts  of
competent  jurisdiction	 in favour of  landlords.   All	 the
relevant  provisions  of <a href="/doc/216843/" id="a_72"> s. 5</a>, sub-s.	(1)  are  absolutely
inapplicable  to cases of such decrees and so we are  unable
to  accept  the argument that even where a decree  has	been
passed	in favour of the landlord a claim for the  execution
of the decree would have to be entertained and considered by
the Controller under<a href="/doc/216843/" id="a_73"> s. 5</a>, sub-s. (1).
</p><p id="p_14">Then it is urged that it would be unreasonable to hold	that
a  certain  class  of  thika  tenants  was  precluded	from
obtaining the benefit of the Act merely because decrees	 for
ejectment were passed before the Act came into force; and it
is  emphasised	that  the  scheme of  the  original  Act  as
evidenced  by <a href="/doc/216843/" id="a_74"> ss.  5</a>,	<a href="/doc/688958/" id="a_75">28</a> and	<a href="/doc/688958/" id="a_76">29</a>  clearly  was  to  afford
protection  to	all  thika tenants even	 where	decrees	 for
ejectment had been passed against them.	 It must be conceded
that  under  the  original  Act,<a href="/doc/688958/" id="a_77"> s.  28</a>	 purported  to	give
protection to judgmentdebtors' and required that the decrees
passed	against	 thika	tenants should be  examined  by	 the
courts	that  passed  the  decrees  in	the  light  of	 the
provisions  of	the Thika Tenancy Act.	But,  later  on,  it
appears to have been thought prudent to limit the protection
to such judgment-debtors in the manner contemplated by<a href="/doc/216843/" id="a_78"> s. 5</a>,
sub-s.	(2)  of	 the  amending	Ordinance  of  1952.	Such
judgment-debtors  were allowed liberty to apply for  setting
aside  the decrees passed against them within  three  months
after  the  commencement  of the  said	Ordinance  and	such
applications were required to be dealt with according to law
even after the Ordinance ceased to be operative.  As we have
already pointed out, the decree with which we are  concerned
in  the	 present  appeal falls within  the  purview  of	 the
provision  of <a href="/doc/216843/" id="a_79"> s. 5</a>, sub-s. (2) of the	Ordinance.   If	 the
judgment.  debtor  did	not  avail  himself  of	 the   right
conferred  on him by this provision, he cannot now  seek  to
rectify	 the omission by relying on the provisions of<a href="/doc/216843/" id="a_80"> s.  5</a>,
sub-s. (1) as amended.	It may be unfortunate that owing  to
the steps that he was taking in several
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">371</span>
proceedings adopted by him in the present litigation he	 was
probably  not advised to make a proper application under <a href="/doc/216843/" id="a_81"> s.
5</a>,  sub-s.  (2)	 of  the Ordinance; but	 that  is  the	only
protection  that he and judgment-debtors of his	 class	were
entitled  to after the amending Ordinance of 1952 came	into
force.	 It would, therefore, not be reasonable to  complain
that no protection whatever has been given to this class  of
thika tenants.	It may be that the extent of the  protection
now  afforded  to  this	 class may not	be  as	wide  as  it
originally  was	 under	s.  28 of Act II  of  1949  but	 the
deletion  of <a href="/doc/688958/" id="a_82"> s. 28</a> clearly indicates that  the	 Legislature
wanted	to revise its policy in this matter.  The  position,
therefore,  is	that  the conclusion which  follows  from  a
reasonable construction of<a href="/doc/216843/" id="a_83"> s. 5</a>, sub-s. (1) is	corroborated
by  the deletion of<a href="/doc/688958/" id="a_84"> s. 28</a> from the Act and by the  provision
of<a href="/doc/216843/" id="a_85"> s.	  5</a>,  sub-s. (2) of the amending Ordinance  of	1952
and<a href="/doc/9537/" id="a_86"> s.	  9</a>   of   the	amending  Act  VI   of	 1953.	  We
must,accordingly,  hold	 that the Calcutta  High  Court	 was
right  in  rejecting  the appellant's  argument	 that  civil
courts	had  no	 jurisdiction  to  entertain  the  execution
petition filed by the respondent against the appellant.	  In
the  result,  the appeal fails and must	 be  dismissed	with
costs.
