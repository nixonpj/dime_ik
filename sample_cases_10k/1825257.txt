 Southern Agrifurane Industries Ltd.

</pre>

<p id="p_1">V.S.  SIRPURKAR, J.  
</p>
<p id="p_2">                This judgment shall dispose of four writ petitions,  they
being W.P.   Nos.12463 of 1998, 12464 of 1998, 12465 of 1998 and 12466 of 
1998.  All the writ petitions more or the  less  pertained  to  a  common  
controversy involved.
</p>
<p id="p_3">                2.  Four  original  petitions viz., O.P.  Nos.1326 &amp; 1327
of 1997, 172 7 of 1997, 3999 of 1997 and 868 of 1998 came to be  disposed
of by  the  Tamil  Nadu Taxation Special Tribunal by a common order.  The
present writ petitions pertained to that common order.    These  original       
petitions  pertained to the various orders passed under the provisions of
Tamil Nadu General Sales Tax  Act  (in  short  the  Act)  as  also  the
Government Orders passed.    W.P.   No.12463 of 1998 is against the order
passed in O.P.  No.868 of 1998 challenging the communications dated  11-1 
1-1996 and 13-2-1997.    W.P.    No.12464  of  1998 pertains to the order
passed in O.P.  No.1327 of 1997 which was against the  proceedings  dated
27-3-1997 rejecting the request of the petitioner for waiver of interest.
W.P.  No.12465  of  1998 pertains to the order passed in O.P.  No.1727 of      
1997 wherein a declaration was claimed  that  G.O.    Ms.    No.18  dated
18-1-1995 and G.O.  Ms.  No.31 dated 3-2-1995 were bad in law and as such        
ineffective.  Lastly, W.P.  No.12466 of 1998 pertains to O.P.  No.3999 of

1997  and  seeks  to  quash  the  order dated 31-7-19 98 in that original
petition and further seeks the  relief  of  confirmation  of  G.O.    Ms.
No.417 dated 7-10-1997. 
</p>
<p id="p_4">                3.   Following  facts  which  emerged  during  the debate
before us would be essential to comprehend the  controversy  involved  in
these matters.
</p>
<p id="p_5">                3.1.  The   petitioner,   M/s.      Southern   Agrifurane
Industries Limited ( hereinafter referred to as the petitioner company)
is a registered company under the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_2">Companies Act</a>, 1957.  It became a  sick
industrial  undertaking  due  to heavy losses in terms of Sec.3(o) of the
Sick  Industrial  Companies  (Special  Provision)  Act,  1985  (in  short
SICA).
</p><p id="p_6">                3.2.  The petitioner company was referred to the Board of
Industrial and  Financial  Reconstruction (briefly BIFR).  A case (Case
No.110 of 1998) was, therefore, registered before the BIFR.    Number  of
meetings and hearings were held whereafter a scheme came to be formulated  
on 28-7-1993.  The following parties were heard, they being:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">                (a) M/s.  Southern Agrifurance Ltd.  (Petitioner)
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">                (b) Bank of Madura
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">                (c) Syndicate Bank 
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">                (d) Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI)
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">                (e) Industrial Finance Corporation of India (IFCI
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_6">                (f) Tamilnadu Industrial Investment
Corporation Limited (TIIC)

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_7">                (g) Southern Petrochemical Industries
                Corporation Limited (SPIC)

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_8">                (h) State Industrial Promotion Corporation
of Tamilnadu Limited (S<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_3">IPC</a>OT) 
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_9">                (i) South India Sugars Limited
                3.3.    In   a   scheme   that  was  formulated  for  the              
rehabilitation of the sick industrial undertakings  and  to  inject  life
into  them,  a  number  of  measures  were  were  ordered  wherein it was       
estimated that the  petitioner-company  would  require  a  total  sum  of
Rs.1491 lakhs which were to be provided as under:
</blockquote><p id="p_7">Interest free unsecured loans Rs.  568.00

Promoters Rights Issue of
Equity Capital Rs.  300.00

Deferment of Sales Tax by the
Government of Tamil Nadu Rs.  623.00 
</p><p id="p_8">                                        ----------
</p><p id="p_9">                                                Rs.1491.00 

                3.4.   As  regards  the  last item, that is deferment of
sales-tax by the Government of Tamil Nadu, which was solely depended upon  
the decision taken by  the  Government  of  Tamil  Nadu,  2nd  respondent
herein, it was mentioned in the scheme:
</p><p id="p_10">To  grant  interest-free  deferment  of  sales-tax payable to Tamil Nadu
Government on sales of Furfural and IMFS during the 6 months period  from
January 1993 to June 1993 (Rs.623 lakhs approx.).  The deferred amount of
sales-tax as above shall be repayable during the 3 years period from July
1, 1994 to June 30, 1997.
</p><p id="p_11">Thus,  the  sales-tax  liability  of  the  petitioner  company  was to be
deferred for the aforementioned period of  six  months  and  instead  the       
petitioner company could repay the deferred sales-tax within three years
period as  indicated.    Of  course,  in  the same scheme, it was clearly
mentioned  at  para  3(E)(v)  that  the  Central  Government,  the  State
Government   and  the  banks/institutions  shall  reserve  the  right  of
recompense for the sacrifices undertaken by them under the scheme as also 
the  right  to  accelerate  the  repayment  schedule,  if  the  cash-flow
projections and  other  conditions of the company so warrant.  It is also
mentioned therein that such rights would  be  exercised  with  the  prior
approval of  BIFR.   There is nothing on record that the State Government
was directly heard but there is enough evidence on  record  that  it  had
agreed for the deferral mentioned above.
</p>
<p id="p_12">                3.5.    However,   even   before   this  order  could  be
implemented, the period of deferral between 1-1-1993  and  30-6-1993  had
already expired and it is the claim of the petitioner company that it had
already paid  the taxes for that period.  It seems that thereafter it was
felt that the scope of the capital expenditure had widened on account  of
the  additional outlay of Rs.468 lakhs which had arisen on account of the
necessity  to  comply  with  the  excise  regulations  for  handling  and
distillation  of  molasses/spirit  in the petitioner-companys distillery
and IMFS Division and  bonded  warehouse  for  IMFS  and  improvement  of
furfural quality  for  export  purpose.    There  was a liability of past
excise duty on account of sale of Furfural of Rs.155 lakhs pertaining  to
the  period  from  September,  1991  to December, 1992 had to be met and,
therefore, the petitioner company had proposed that in order to meet  the
additional  capital  expenditure  the  Government  of Tamilnadu may grant
deferment of interest-free  sales-tax  of  Furfural/IMFS  payable  during
twelve  months  period  (as  against  six  months  agreed to by the State      
Government and has held in the scheme) from October, 1993  to  September, 
1994 i.e.    between  1-10-1993  and 30-9-1994 and the deferred sales-tax
should be repayable not within three  years  as  agreed  to  earlier  but     
during the  period  from  October 1, 1995 to September 30, 2000 i.e.  for
five years.  A communication to that effect seems to have  been  sent  by
the  IDBI which was to act as the operating agency as per the orders of
the BIFR to the Principal Secretary to the Government vide  letter  dated
19-8-1993.   Unfortunately,  the  letter containing the proposal from the
petitioner-company is not available and it was reported before us that it
was   not   traceable   either   in   the   Government   files   or   the
petitioner-companys records.
</p>
<p id="p_13">                3.6.  It seems that in pursuance of this letter, a letter
came to be sent by  the  Special  Secretary  to  the  Government  to  the
Registrar of  BIFR on 23-9-1993.  In this letter, a reference was made to
the earlier order passed by the BIFR as also to the fact of deferment  of
sales-tax  amounting to Rs.623 lakhs approximately for six months between
January, 1993 to June, 1993.  A reference was then made in paragraph 2 to
a request made by the company for sanctioning of  deferral  of  sales-tax
for  one  year  from  1-10-1993  to  30-9-11994  and for repayment of the
deferral sales-tax in five years after a moratorium period of  one  year.
A  reference  was  also made to the aforementioned letter dated 19-8-1993
sent by the operating agency,  viz.    IDBI.    It  was  then  stated  in
paragraph  3 that the Government had considered the above request made by 
the petitioner company and had  proposed  to  sanction  the  deferral  of
sales-tax  for  one  year  from  1-10-1993 to 30-9-1994 and to permit the
repayment thereof in five years period after a moratorium period  of  one
year.   Unfortunately  even  this  letter  is not available either in the
court records or in the records of the petitioner  company.    A  further
request was made that the proposal of the company should be placed before 
the BIFR  for  its  consideration and conveying its approval earlier.  It
was obvious that the petitioner company having already paid its  dues  of
sales-tax  between  1-1-1993  and 30-6-1993 and being dissatisfied by the
ceiling fixed by the BIFR to the extent of Rs.623  lakhs  had  wanted  to
take  the  advantage of extended period of one year instead of six months
as also had sought the extension to five years from three  years  of  the
repayment schedule. 
</p>
<p id="p_14">                3.7.  It seems that in pursuance  of  this  letter,  BIFR
amended the scheme on 8-12-1993.  The amendment is as follows:   
</p><p id="p_15">        On  page  4  at  para  B(i)  of the above mentioned sanctioned
scheme, Sales tax deferment during the six months  period  from  January
1993  to June, 1993 (Rs.623 lakhs approximately) has been mentioned to be 
repayable during the three years period from July 1, 1994 to June  30,  1
</p><p id="p_16">997.   It  is  now  amended as deferment for one year from 1-10-1993 to 3
0-9-1994 to be repayable during the period from 1-10-1993 to 30-9-200 0.
Unfortunately for us the amended minutes of the meeting dated 8-12-19  93
are not made available by the petitioner company or the State Government.
</p>
<p id="p_17">                3.8.   After  this  amendment  dated 8-12-1993, the State
Government proceeded  to  pass  a  Government  Order  (G.O.Ms.No.5  dated         
7-1-1994).  We  shall advert to this Government Order later on.  However,
at this juncture, it may only be  stated  that  after  referring  to  the
aforementioned  letter  of  IDBI and after taking the resume of the facts
till then and also noting the changes in the cost of rehabilitation/means
of financing and other changes due to elapse of  time  between  operating
agencys  report  and  the  actual sanction granted by the BIFR dated 8-1      
2-1993 as aforementioned of extending the deferment as well as  repayment 
of  taxes and after noting the fact that the company had already paid the
sales-tax for the earlier period  from  1-1-1993  to  30-6-1993,  it  was
directed  that  the  petitioner  company  should be granted the sales-tax
deferral for a period of one year from 1-10-1993  to  30-9-1994  and  the
repayment  of  this  deferred  tax  should be over a period of five years
starting from 1-10-1995 to 30-9-2000.    Paragraph  5  (which  should  be
ordinarily para 4) is extremely important and it reads as under:
The Commercial Taxes and Religious Endowments Department is requested to    
issue necessary notification with reference to para 3 above.  ( It should
be  para 4 of the letter as that paragraph has been wrongly numbered as
para 4)

In pursuance of this, even a notification seems to  have  been  published
vide G.O.   Ms.    No.62  dated  4-3-1994  in  the official gazette under
Sec.17A of the Tamil Nadu General Sales Tax Act. 
</p>
<p id="p_18">                3.9.  The BIFR then held fresh meeting on  18-8-1994  and
again heard all the eight parties mentioned earlier.  The minutes of that
meeting have  been  placed before the Court by the State Government.  The
minutes suggest that in the earlier framed scheme dated  28-7-1993  under
Sec.18(4) of  SICA was referred.  It was then stated that on that date of
hearing, i.e.  on 18-8-1994 the implementation of  the  said  scheme  was 
reviewed.   The  minutes  further mentioned that a case was put up by the
representative of the monitoring agency that after the  sanction  of  the
scheme  the  company  had  to incur additional capital expenditure of 468     
lakhs and paid the statutory dues of Rs.155 lakhs on account  of  central
excise duty  for the year 1991-92.  The additional capital expenditure of
Rs.468 lakhs which was not known earlier at the time of sanction  of  the
scheme had to be incurred mainly to comply with the requirements of State
Excise  Regulations  for handling and distillation of molasses/spirit and
storage of IMFS, etc.  It was also represented by the said representative
that some tasks like setting up of effluent  treatment  plant  (ETP)  and
erection of FBC boilers were progressing as per schedule while a new tank
had already been completed and the ETP was expected to be commissioned by    
September, 1994.    The  said  representative then pleaded that the total    
cost of rehabilitation would  now  be  about  Rs.2114  lakhs  as  against
Rs.1491 lakhs under the scheme sanctioned on 28-7-1993.  When a query was          
put  to the representative of the company it seems to have been submitted
by him that  the  additional  expenditure  of  Rs.623  lakhs  (difference
between Rs.211 4 lakhs and Rs.1491 laks)- explanatory bracket added by us 
  would  be met out of the deferment of sales-tax agreed to by the State
Government.  The representative of the company had also  added  that  the       
State  of  Tamil  Nadu  had already sanctioned deferment of the sales-tax
vide G.O.  Ms.  No.5 dated 7-1-1994.  The Board  then  ultimately  passed       
the following order:
</p><p id="p_19">After  hearing  the  parties,  the Bench sanctioned the enhanced cost of
rehabilitation of Rs.2114 lakhs.  The additional  cost  of  Rs.623  lakhs
would  be  financed  out  of  sales-tax  deferral  of  Rs.623  lakhs  and
additional promoters contribution of Rs.10 lakhs.   The  Bench  rejected
the contentions of the company seeking deletion of the clauses pertaining
to  the  right  of  recompense  of the banks and the institutions as this


right could be exercised only with the
approval of the BIFR and directed S<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_4">IPC</a>OT to reconcile the accounts within
a period of two months.
</p>
<p id="p_20">                3.10.  It seems that thereafter the Government  came  out 
with G.O.  Ms.    No.18  dated  18-1-1995.    A reference was made to the
earlier passed G.O.  Ms.5 as also to  the  letter  sent  by  the  Special
Commissioner  and  Commissioner  of  Commercial  Taxes  Department  dated                 
20-4-1994 wherein  the  Commissioner  had  requested  the  Government  to 
restrict  the  salestax  deferral  granted  to the petitioner to the book
value of fixed assets of the company.  A reference was also further  made
to a  letter  dated 7-7-1994 being a Government D.O.  letter addressed to
the Special Commissioner and Commissioner of Commercial  Taxes  that  the       
aggregated deferral amount was not likely to exceed the amount of Rs.1246
lakhs which  was  the  expected  cash  inflow as per the BIFR package.  A 
reference was also made to the letter written from the petitioner company
dated 4-8-1994 where a request was made to the Government to  permit  the
petitioner  to  avail  the  deferral  of  sales-tax for one year from 1-1
0-1993 to 30-9-1994 as approved by  the  BIFR  and  the  Government.    A 
further  reference  was  made  to the sanctioned scheme and the amendment   
made thereto vide order dated 8-12-1993.  A statement  then  came  to  be
made: 
</p>
<p id="p_21">The  total  amount  of  deferral envisaged in the BIFR scheme dated 28-7
</p><p id="p_22">-1993 for a period of six months was Rs.623 lakhs.    Consequent  on  the
extension  of  deferral  to  one  year  the  total  anticipated amount of
deferral works out to Rs.1246 lakhs.  Accordingly, the Government  direct
that   total   amount  of  sales-tax  deferral  granted  to  M/s.Southern        
Agrifurance Industries Limited be fixed at Rs.1246 lakhs.    This  amount
should be repaid over a period of 5 years after a moratorium of one year,
i.e.   from  1-10-1995  to 30-9-2000 as already ordered in the Government
order first read above.
</p>
<p id="p_23">                3.11.  It seems that in this letter dated  4-8-1994,  the
petitioner  company  had  made  a request in terms of the order passed by
BIFR.  The said letter has  been  placed  on  record  by  the  petitioner
company.   From  that  letter  it  seems  that the petitioner company had    
received  a  notice  dated  29-7-1994  from  Deputy  Commercial  Officer,
Villupuram  asking  the  petitioner company to pay a sum of Rs.374 lakhs.
In the notice it was found that the deferral of sales-tax on the sale  of
IMFS  and  Furfural  had  thus been restricted to Rs.12.16 lakhs only and
since the company had already availed the deferral of salestax of Rs.1590
lakhs upto June, 1994, the  excess  amount  of  Rs.374  lakhs  should  be
refunded to  the  Department immediately.  The petitioner company in this
letter then pleaded that as per the revised order dated  8-12-1993  while
revising the period for deferral from six months to one year the BIFR had
not fixed  any  monetary  ceiling  on  the deferral of sales-tax.  It was
further pleaded that even in the order dated  23-9-1993,  the  petitioner
company  was  allowed  to  have the deferral for a period of one year and   
that the funds made available by the deferral were fully utilised for the
revival of the company as approved by the Bench.  A request was then made 
that since it was the policy of the Government of Tamil Nadu to  come  to
the  rescue  of  the  sick industries and to revive them, it was with the
support of the Government that the petitioner company was  surging  ahead
with  its  scheme  of  revival  as approved by the BIFR and that fruitful
results were just started on this exercise.  It was also pointed out that
on the present level of production  the  petitioner  company  was  paying
about Rs.50  crores by way of taxes.  In that view, it was requested that
the Special Commissioner and  Commissioner  of  Commercial  Taxes  should         
permit  the petitioner company to avail the deferral of sales tax for one
full year, with effect from 1 -10-1993 to 30-10-1994 as approved  by  the
BIFR and  the  Government of Tamil Nadu.  The latent request was that the
deferral amount should not be restricted to Rs.1216 lakhs as  was  stated
in the notice received by it.
</p>

<p id="p_24">                3.12.    Perhaps   realising  that  there  was  no  clear
reference to the ceiling limit of deferred sales-tax in G.O.  Ms.    No.5
or as the  case  may  be  G.O.  Ms.  No.62 and the petitioner company was 
taking undue advantage of the  same  even  contrary  to  the  scheme  the
aforementioned G.O.   Ms.    No.18 came to be issued clearly ordering the
ceiling at Rs.1246 lakhs (and not Rs.1216 lakhs as appeared in the notice
of the company).  In pursuance of  this  Government  Order  a  subsequent 
notification came  to be published vide G.O.Ms.  No.31 on 3-2-1995 in the
official gazette under the provisions of  Sec.17(A)  of  the  Tamil  Nadu
General Sales Tax  Act.   These last two Government Orders, i.e.  G.O.Ms.        
Nos.18 and 31 are the principal objects of attack in these petitions.
</p>
<p id="p_25">                4.  Before we advert to the  contentions  raised  by  the
learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner,  few  facts  because of which the
matters came before the sales-tax authorities are also necessary.
</p>
<p id="p_26">                5.  It seems that after sending the aforementioned letter
dated 4-8 -1994, the petitioner company thought that the G.O.Ms.    No.18
dated 18 -1-1995 had restricted their liability to Rs.1246 lakhs and even
G.O.Ms.No.31  which  was  the  statutory  notification  had confirmed the
action taken in G.O.Ms.  No.18.  It seems  that  the  petitioner  company       
kept quiet.   The liability of the petitioner company for the taxes which
was to the tune of Rs.374 lakhs, as showed in the Government letter dated
29-7-1994, had thereafter swollen for which  the  notices  were  sent  on
31-7-1996, 21-8-1996  and  10-9-1996.    It seems, the petitioner company
ignored those notices.  Therefore, a notice dated 11-11-1996 came  to  be
issued clearly making a reference to the earlier said notices and further
making  a  demand  of  the excess tax to the tune of Rs.5,51,91,688 along
with the interest under Sec.24(3)of the Tamil Nadu General Sales Tax  Act
to the  tune  of  Rs.4,36,48,594,  totalling to Rs.9,88,40,282/-.  It was
clearly suggested in the notice that if the above arrears  is  not  paid,
coercive  steps  will  be  taken as provided under the Tamil Nadu General
Sales Tax Act.  There is no  clear  history  available  as  to  what  the
petitioner company had done  as  regards G.O.  Ms.  No.18.  It only seems       
from the papers that the  petitioner  company  wrote  two  letters  dated
21-2-1995  and  another  letter  dated 27-3-1995 pleading their old case.      
The third letter appears to have been sent only in July 18, 1996 and  all
the  while  it  seems that the Government was only sending notices or had 
kept quiet.
</p>
<p id="p_27">                6.  A letter seems to have been sent  on  3-10-1996  with
regard  to  the letter of the petitioner company dated 31-7-1996 pointing
out  that  the  arrears  had  mounted  to  the   staggering   amount   of
Rs.9,76,99,654/-.   It  seems  that  it is only in respect of this letter
that ultimately a  notice  threatening  to  take  coercive  action  dated
11-11-1996 came  to  be  issued.  This time probably the Government meant        
business and started taking coercive action by  writing  to  the  various
banks.  It seems that in response to the earlier notice dated 11-11-1996,
the  petitioner  company  requested  by  letter  dated  15-11-1996 to the        
Principal Secretary, Industries Department firstly to waive the  interest
amount of Rs.4.37 crores on the ground that the deferral of sales-tax was
interest-free one and the entire sales-tax amount was used only to revive
the sick  unit.   It is secondly claimed that the two instalments awarded
to it for making the balance amount of taxes of Rs.5.52  crores.    These
requests  seem  to  have been considered by the Government in its G.O.Ms.
No.539 dated 31-12-1996 wherein  the  Government  refused  to  grant  the      
waiver  of  interest  and merely granted two instalments  first being in
December 1996 and the second being 15th March, 1997, meaning thereby that   
the earlier amount of about  Rs.9,88,40,282/-  was  to  be  paid  in  two
instalments.   There  were  also  five conditions one of which was that a
default of any  condition  would  result  in  the  entire  balance  being
recovered in  one lumpsum.  It appears that even here the company did not
pay anything in December, 1996 but paid the first instalment on 10-1-1997
of approximately Rs.4.94 crores.  It then paid the  remaining  instalment
of  approximately  Rs.5.89 lakhs on 14-3-1997 but, before that it wrote a
letter on 18-1-1997 wherein it was suggested that without prolonging  the
matter,  the petitioner company was going to settle the amount of Rs.5.52
crores immediately rather than making the payments  in  two  instalments.
The amount  was  requested  to be accepted.  It was pointed out that they     
already paid the amount of Rs.4,94,20,141 before this date.  They claimed
that the balance of Rs.57 ,71,547 would be settled on the  acceptance  of
the Government.   The request of waiver of interest of Rs.4.37 crores was    
again reiterated.  It seems that on the even date, i.e.   18-1-1997,  the
petitioner  company  wrote  to  the Government that they had effected the
payment of Rs.4,94,20,141/- towards the first  instalment  in  compliance
with the conditions  of  the  G.O.Ms.  No.539 dated 31-12-1996.  Thus, on        
18-1-1997 whereas by one stance the petitioner company was complying with  
the order dated 31-12-1996 and had paid the first instalment out  of  the
two instalments granted, it still wrote another letter in which it showed
its  readiness  to  pay  the  balance  of the deferred taxes amounting to
approximately Rs.5.52 crores in lumpsum and it has also made an offer  to
pay the  remaining  amount  of  Rs.57,71,547/-.    These two letters were       
clearly inconsistent with each other but that aspect would be  considered
later on.
</p>
<p id="p_28">                7.   On  11-3-1997,  the petitioner company wrote another
letter pointing out that it had agreed  to  pay  Rs.5.52  crores  in  two
instalments  and again requested to waive the interest of Rs.4.37 crores.
A reference to G.O.  Ms.539 was again made and the  earlier  inconsistent
offer made on 18-1-1997 of paying the entire amount of Rs.5.52 crores was
repeated.    On  14-3-1997,  however,  the  company  paid  the  remaining
instalment of Rs.5,89,000/-  approximately  which  was  nothing  but  the
second  instalment  from  out of the total amount of Rs.9,88,40,282/- but
not before the writing of the letter dated 11-3-1997.  Strangely  enough,
the  Government,  by  its letter dated 17-3-1997, directed the company to
pay Rs.57,71,547/-.  In fact, this amount was  not  at  all  due  as  the
petitioner  company  had  already  paid  the  two  instalments as per the
directions of the Government in G.O.Ms.  No.539 which was perhaps ignored 
or was made to be ignored because of the  contradictory  two  letters  on
18-1-1997.    Using  this  very  stance  of  the  Government  asking  the       
petitioner company to deposit Rs.57,71,547/-.    The  petitioner  company
immediately  changed  its  stand  and  then  treated  the  amount paid on
14-3-1997 as the tax for February which had not fallen due or  which  was
not demanded in the earlier demand at all.
</p>
<p id="p_29">        8.   The  petitioner company merely tried to show that the second
payment was not in pursuance of the order made in G.O.Ms.No.539 dated  31  
</p><p id="p_30">-12-1996  but was because of the Governments order directing the company 
to pay Rs.57,71,547/-.  It tried to show as if the Government had  agreed
merely  to  accept the deferred tax amount of Rs.5.52 crores out of which
it had already  paid  Rs.4,94,20,141/-  since  the  Government  later  on
directed  the  company  to  pay  Rs.57,71,  547/- which was the remaining
amount out of Rs.5.52 crores which was the tax  amount.    In  this,  the     
petitioner company seems to have ingenuously skirted the issue of payment
of interest  under  Sec.24(3)  which  in  fact  it had already paid.  The
petitioner company, it seems, took the stance that the amount  which  was
paid  on 14-3-1997 was for the month of February which amount was neither
demanded by the earlier notice nor was even  contemplated  earlier.    Be
that as it may, the petitioner company is now pursuing the same stand and
thereby  wants  to  avoid  the  payment  of interest which had fallen due             
because of the earlier default on its part to pay Rs.5.52 crores  by  way
of tax.
</p>
<p id="p_31">                9.   Finding that the Government was not relenting to its
request the petitioner company promptly  filed  four  original  petitions
before the Special Tribunal, the details of which have already been given
in the earlier part of the order.  The Special Appellate Tribunal did not
accept  the  case  pleaded  by  the  petitioner and it seems all the four
petitions more particularly in respect of G.O.Ms.   No.18  and  31  which
according  to  the petitioner company could not have been issued as under
those Government Orders the Government had  put  a  ceiling  to  the  tax       
deferral of  one  year  which ceiling was not there earlier.  The Special
Tribunal took the view that in fact the Government had not gone  back  on
its  promise  nor  had  it in fact put a ceiling as the Government had in
fact agreed to give the benefit of the tax deferral only to the  tune  of
Rs.623 lakhs.    The  Tribunal took the view that in spite of this if the
Government then granted the tax deferral of Rs.1246 lakhs it could not be
said that the Government had gone back on their promise or had  no  power
to do so.    We  have  to now see whether the said G.O.Ms.  Nos.18 and 31 
were within the powers of the Government or they are vitiated because  of
the illegality attached to it.
</p>
<p id="p_32">                10.   Learned counsel for the petitioner Shriprakash came
out with the following submissions:
</p><p id="p_33">                10.1.  Learned counsel firstly submits that the basis for
G.O.  Ms.  No.5 and the resultant G.O.Ms.No.62 which  is  a  notification
issued  under  Sec.17(A)  of  the Tamil Nadu General Sales Tax Act is the
order of BIFR dated 8-12-1993 by which the BIFR amended the scheme.    We  
have  already  in  the  earlier  part  of  this  order quoted that order.
According to the learned  counsel  though  in  the  earlier  order  dated
28-7-199  3,  the  BIFR had fixed the ceiling of the deferral of taxes at
Rs.623 lakhs, no such ceiling was to be found in the aforementioned order
dated 8-12-1993.  According to him, G.O.Ms.  Nos.5 and 62, which emanated  
from this BIFRs order, also did not fix any ceiling and, therefore,  the
Government could  not  subsequently pass G.O.Ms.  No.18 and the resultant 
G.O.Ms.No.31 to provide the ceiling to the tax deferral of Rs.1246 lakhs.
According to the learned counsel, the order dated 8-12-1993 by  the  BIFR
was  binding on the Government particularly under Sec.19(3) and Sec.32 of
SICA.  The learned counsel further pointed out that the Government at  no
point of time moved under Sec.18(5) of SICA for correction or explanation
of  the  order  dated  8-12-1993  and,  therefore, the subsequent G.O.Ms. 
No.18 and 31 being contrary to the BIFR scheme have to  be  held  illegal
and vitiated on that ground.
</p><p id="p_34">                10.2.  The argument is clearly erroenous both on facts as
well as  on  law.    Firstly,  it  has to be borne in mind that after the
passing the first scheme and restricting the tax deferral at Rs.623 lakhs
since the order itself came to be  passed  on  28-7-1993  and  since  the
concerned  period  of  1-1-1993 to 30-6-1993 had already elapsed by then,
there was no necessity felt on the part of the Government to take out any
Government Order or to issue a notification under Sec.17(A) of the  TNGST
Act.   The  petitioner company also did not insist on the same because it
had already paid off that tax by then as it was required to pay the taxes
monthly.  It is at that stage that it was realised that apart  from  this
Rs.623 lakhs, which was the part of the package scheme for revival of the
petitioner company,  there  was  an  additional expenditure involved.  It
will be seen that the additional liability was  to  the  tune  of  Rs.623
lakhs.   Again  as  the  petitioner  company had to spend Rs.468 lakhs on
account of the  necessity  to  comply  with  the  excise  regulation  for
handling  and distillation of molasses/spirit in the petitioner-companys
distillery  and  IMFS  division  and  bonded  warehouses  for  IMFS   and
improvement of  furfural  quality  for  export  purposes.    Besides this
liability, there was the further liability of Rs.155 lakhs pertaining  to
the  period from September, 1991 to December, 1992 on account of the past
excise duty.  It is obvious that the petitioner  company  had  approached  
IDBI  which  was  the  operating agency and it was only on account of the
petitioner-companys approach and pointing out  that  its  liability  had
increased  that IDBI had written to the Principal Secretary by its letter
dated 19-8-1993.  Now IDBI could never have come to know about the  extra
liabilities unless the petitioner-company had represented the same to it.
</p>
<p id="p_35">                10.3.   We  perused  the original files of the Government
wherein, there is a letter dated 6-9-1993 written by IDBI  to  the  BIFR,
the  copy  of  which  has  been  given  to the Principal Secretary of the
Government.  In the supplementary report, which accompanies that  letter,
there is a clear reference as under:
</p><p id="p_36">Subsequent to the operation of O.A.  Report, circulation of draft scheme
by  BIFR,  certain  facts  had  come  to  the companys notice which were 
conveyed to BIFR/O.A.  vide letters dated 9th July, 1993 and 21st August,
1993.
</p><p id="p_37">From  this  it  is  clear  that  the  petitioner-company  had  made   the
representations  only  about  the  aforementioned additional liability of
Rs.62 3 lakhs.  It is strange that these letters should not be found with
the petitioner-company though we had specifically desired  to  seek  them
during the  debate.    A  clear  reference  is  to  be  found in the said
supplementary report under paragraph 2.2 that the company itself had made
a grievance on its noticing the additional liability.
</p>
<p id="p_38">                10.4.  Be that as it may, in  that  view,  the  IDBI  had
recommended  for  the  additional  finances  being  made available to the
petitionercompany to the tune of Rs.623  lakhs  (Rs.468  lakhs  +  Rs.155         
lakhs).  IDBI also agreed that the petitioner-companys proposal that the
additional  Rs.623  lakhs  should  be  raised again by increasing the tax
deferral from six months to one year and it  is  for  that  purpose  that
ultimately  BIFR  was approached and the BIFR seems to have accepted this 
proposal of the IDBI which was consented to by the State Government also.
We have already pointed out these facts in the earlier part of this order
which surfaced during the debate and from the records made  available  to
us from  parties  from  time  to time.  Therefore, it was clear that BIFR      
ultimately passed an order on 18-8-1994 i.e.  much before the passing  of
the   G.O.Ms.No.18  or  G.O.Ms.No.31  in  which  these  facts  have  been       
specifically referred to.  It then enhanced the earlier total package  of
Rs.1419 lakhs  to  Rs.2114  lakhs,  i.e.  exactly granting the additional
cost of Rs.623 lakhs.   It  also  then  considered  the  request  by  the
petitioner-company to increase the period of one year.  All this is to be
found in  the minutes dated 18-8-1994.  There can be no doubt, therefore,
that firstly the order dated 8-12-1993 was undoubtedly  amended  and  the        
scheme  itself was amended for which the BIFR had all the necessary power        
and sanction under the provision of SICA.  Therefore, the  argument  that
the  order  dated  8-12-1993 passed by the BIFR which was the basic order
remained intact and was not challenged is in itself incorrect  on  facts.
Secondly,  even  in that order there is nothing to find that the BIFR had   
the intention to give the tax deferral of one year without  any  ceiling.
In  fact,  at  that  stage what was granted to the petitioner-company was
only tax deferral for one year.  However, the other part of  the  earlier
order pertaining to the ceiling of Rs.623 lakhs was left untouched.  That
will  be  clear  from  the  express language of the order dated 8-12-1993
wherein the amendment is only pertaining to the period of  deferment  and
the period  of  repayment.    The  third  part  of the order has not been
amended.  Therefore, even there the  argument  is  incorrect.    Whatever 
doubts  left  were  then  clarified  in  the  order dated 18-8-1994 where
undoubtedly the petitioner-company was granted additional tax deferral of
Rs.623 lakhs.  We are not prepared to accept the  Tribunals  logic  that
the tax  deferral  was  limited  to  only Rs.623 lakhs.  When we read the 
record of the proceedings held on 18-8-1994, there is no doubt left  that
besides  Rs.623  lakhs  of  deferral  which was granted to the petitioner            
company, additional Rs.623 lakhs  were  granted  which  was  required  on        
account of  the  liabilities which we have already explained.  If on this
background the argument of the learned counsel is to be tested  then  the
scheme would be binding on all the concerned parties under the provisions
of  Sec.19(3)  read  with  Sec.32  of  the  SICA but we do not want to be
understood as having accepted the argument  of  the  learned  counsel  on
Sec.19(3)  and  Sec.32 of SICA for the simple reason that on facts itself
the learned counsel is not correct.  It is, therefore, not necessary  for
us to consider that argument.
</p>
<p id="p_39">                10.5.   The  position  which is obtained is that the BIFR
itself had provided Rs.1246  lakhs  in  place  of  Rs.623  lakhs  by  its
subsequent order  and  by amending the scheme.  Once this position on the       
facts is accepted the subsequent argument that G.O.Ms.Nos.18 and 31  were  
contrary or  inconsistent  with  the  scheme has also to fail.  There was 
absolutely nothing inconsistent with those Government Orders.   They  are
perfectly in keeping with the scheme under which Rs.623 lakhs of deferral
was  additionally ordered and the time for the deferral was also extended
from six months to one year as also the period of repayment was  extended 
from 3  years to 5 years with one year moratorium.  There can be no doubt
that the petitioner-company never had any ceiling-less tax  deferral  for
one  year  in  its  mind  because,  its  representation  to  IDBI and the
subsequent representation to BIFR on 18-8-1994 are absolutely clear  that
it had only the additional burden of Rs.623 lakhs in its mind.
</p>
<p id="p_40">                10.6.  Though  much  was argued on the basis of G.O.  Ms.
No.5 dated 7 -1-1994 and it was tried  to  be  suggested  that  the  said
Government  Order  provided  for  no  ceiling on the tax deferral for one
year.  The language itself suggests that the said  Government  Order  did
not grant ceiling-less tax deferral.  When we consider the whole language
of G.O.Ms.    No.5 in paragraph 2 thereof there is a clear reference made
to the communication of the  IDBI  and  the  mention  of  the  additional
capital expenditure required by the petitioner company as per its opinion
as  also the requirement of the extended time of one year of deferral and
five years time for repayment of the deferred tax.    There  is  a  clear
reference  to the additional costs of rehabilitation, scheme of financing
and the action taken by the BIFR.  All this can be seen reflected in  the
Minutes and the order dated 18-8-1994 passed by the BIFR. 
</p>
<p id="p_41">                10.7.  We  have  carefully gone through the G.O.Ms.  No.5       
and the resultant notification under G.O.Ms.  No.31.    In  our  opinion,
G.O.Ms.No.5 and G.O.Ms.No.31, if read jointly, which we must do, no doubt 
is  left that there was no intention to grant a complete tax deferral for
one year that too, without any ceiling.  What was agreed to  and  ordered
accordingly  was certainly not a ceiling-less deferral for one full year.
It may be seen that since IDBI had already made  specific  representation
undoubtedly  on  the  basis  of  the  representation  made  to  it by the       
petitioner-company the mention of the amount of Rs.1246 lakhs was omitted
erroneously  and  without  realising  the  serious  implication  thereof.
Therefore,  it  was  certain  that the petitioner-company also knew as to
what was to be given to it under the package of the scheme  and  that  it
was only  Rs.1246  lakhs  of  tax  deferral.    It is unthinkable that an
unlimited tax deferral would be given particularly where the  liabilities
of  the  petitioner-company  and  its  viability  were being meticulously
tested by the BIFR, the Government and the IDBI.  Therefore, it  did  not
lie in  the  mouth  of the petitioner-company to say by G.O.Ms.  No.5 and
the resultant  G.O.Ms.No.62  unlimited  tax  deferral  of  one  year  was
ordered.  If seeing from this angle, it will be clear that the subsequent
G.O.Ms.Nos.18 and 31 were nothing but clarifying orders perhaps because 
in  the  earlier  Government  Orders  exact  sum of Rs.1240 lakhs was not
mentioned.  Once this factual backdrop is clear, the  argument  that  the
Government  was  cutting  down the unlimited tax deferral earlier granted   
and that too by retrospective effect must fall down.  What was being done
by the Government was only  clarifying  the  earlier  Government  Order
wherein   the   ceiling   limit  of  Rs.1246  lakhs  was  omitted  either      
inadvertently or carelessly.  However, the Government had full  power  to
clarify  the  state  of  affairs which was obtained by drafting some what
slacked drafting of G.O.Ms.Nos.5 and 62.
</p>
<p id="p_42">                11.  On the impermissibility of issuing a  notification
of  retrospective  nature,  the  learned counsel relied on the celebrated
decision of the Supreme Court reported in  AIR  1953  SC  95  (<a href="/doc/925294/" id="a_5">Strawboard 
Manufacturing Co.   vs.    Gutta Mill Workers Union</a>) where Sec.14 of the
U.P.  General Clauses Act fell for consideration.   The  learned  counsel
pointed out  that  the  said  decision  was  consistently  followed.  The
Supreme Court  held  that  in  the  absence  of  any  distinct  provision
providing  the  power  of amendment and modification, the State could not
issue a notification having retrospective effect.  The Supreme Court held
that the amending order operates only prospectively, that  is  only  from
the date of the order and it could not validate the award which have been
made after the expiry of the time specified in the original order.
</p>
<p id="p_43">                11.1.   The  learned  counsel pointed out that a Division
Bench of the Karnataka High  court  has  taken  a  similar  view  in  the
decision reported  in  42  STC  356  (<a href="/doc/1936330/" id="a_6">Ananda  Soap  Factory  v.  State of
Karnataka</a>).  A view was expressed by the Division Bench that there  being
no provision in the Act conferring power on the State Government to issue
a  notification  with retrospective effect, withdrawing a benefit already
given would not be permissible by issuing a fresh notification.
</p><p id="p_44">                11.2.  The learned counsel also referred to the  decision
reported in  112  STC  161  (<a href="/doc/77708/" id="a_7">State  of  Tamil  Nadu  v.  Kannapiran Steel
Re-rolling Mills</a>).  A Division Bench  of  this  Court  was  dealing  with
Sec.8(5)  of  the  <a href="/doc/1645178/" id="a_8">Central Sales Tax Act</a> under which a notification dated
13th March, 1982 was issued granting exemptions in  respect  of  the  tax
payable  with  regard to the end products coming under Item 4 of Schedule       
II to the  Tamil  Nadu  General  Sales  Tax  Act  manufactured  by  steel       
re-rolling  mills  in  Tamil  Nadu  subject  to  the  condition  that the
raw-materials had suffered tax under the Tamil  Nadu  General  Sales  Tax 
Act, which  was  to  come into force from 1st April, 1982.  Subsequently,     
the Government of Tamil  Nadu  issued  another  notification  dated  25th      
April,  1986  cancelling the notification granting exemption and the said
cancellation was effected with effect from 17-3-1986.  The  question  was
whether  such  a  cancellation with retrospective effect was possible and    
permissible.  Following the decision in Ananda Soap Factory, cited  supra
and  relying  on  the  other  decisions  reported  in  AIR 1970 SC 1950 (
<a href="/doc/372795/" id="a_9">Cannanore Spinning and Weaving Mills Ltd.  v.  Collector of  Customs  and
Central Excise</a>); AIR   1966   Ker.    5  (<a href="/doc/1214358/" id="a_10">Income-tax  Officer  v.    M.C.
Ponnoose</a>); AIR 1963 SC 274 (<a href="/doc/1987359/" id="a_11">Indramani Pyarelal Gupta v.  W.R.  Natu</a>); AIR        
1960 Mys.326 (<a href="/doc/872990/" id="a_12">India Sugars and Refineries Ltd.  v.  State of Mysore</a>); AIR
1953 SC 95 (<a href="/doc/925294/" id="a_13">Strawboard Manufacturing Co.  Ltd.  v.  Gutta  Mill  Workers 
Union</a>),  the  Division  Bench  held  that  in the absence of any specific
provision permitting to do so such  a  retrospective  withdrawal  of  the
benefit or the exemption as the case may be was not possible.
</p>
<p id="p_45">                11.3.  In this behalf, it was further pointed out relying
on another  decision reported in 113 STC 26 (<a href="/doc/886356/" id="a_14">Honest Corporation v.  State
of Tamil Nadu</a>) that a Division Bench  of  this  Court  had  held  that  a
modification  to  any notification under Sec.17 of the Tamil Nadu General
Sales Tax Act can be made only prospectively and not retrospectively.
</p>
<p id="p_46">                11.4.  Speaking about the decision in Honest  Corporation
case,  cited supra, it must be said that there the Bench was specifically
of the opinion that though subsection (1) of Sec.17 permitted  the  State
Government  to  make  exemption  prospectively  or  retrospectively,  the     
language of subsection (3) thereof was very clear which  did  not  permit
the   Government   to   cancel   or   vary  or  modify  any  notification
retrospectively.  It was on  that  basis  alone  that  the  decision  was
rendered.   The  learned  counsel points out that under subsection (3) of
Sec.17, there was at  least  a  power  of  cancellation  or  varying  the
notification  and in case of Sec.17(A) which has fallen for consideration
in this case there is no power like Sec.17(3) and, therefore, that  could
be  all  the  more reason to hold that there was no such power to cancel,
vary  or  modify  the  earlier  issued  notification   much   less   with
retrospective effect.
</p>
<p id="p_47">                11.5.   We  must point out at the out set that Sec.17 and
Sec.17(A) of the Tamil Nadu General Sales Tax Act operate  in  completely
different spheres.    Therefore,  while  Sec.17  considers  the  power of        
exemption of payment of tax or reduction in their rates, Sec.17(A) speaks
only about the deferral of the payment of taxes without  wiping  out  the
tax liability.   Sec.17(A) has limited operation as it is only in case of
new industrial unit, sick unit or sick  textile  mills.    It  cannot  be
forgotten  that  there  is a specific power given under subsection (1) of
conferring  tax  deferral   to   such   units   prospectively   or   even
retrospectively.   The  aforementioned  decisions  turns  solely  on  the
express language of Sec.17(3) which conspicuously  did  not  provide  any
power  to  the Government to cancel or vary the notification issued under
subsection (1) with retrospective effect.  The reason is not far to  see.
Sec.17  of  the  Tamil  Nadu  General  Sales  Tax  Act  speaks of a total
exemption or reduction in rates of the taxes.   Once  such  exemption  or 
reduction  in  the  rates  was  already  enjoyed  by  the  tax-payer, the
Government could not have retraced its steps back and insisted  upon  the
payment of the exemption or reduced taxes.  In case of Sec.17, there will
be  no  question  of  going to the Tamil Nadu General Clauses Act because
obviously there is a specific provision in shape of  Sec.17(3)  regarding
the Governments  power to cancel, vary or modify any notification.  Once     
there is such a provision available, there would be no question  to  fall
back upon  the  <a href="/doc/905940/" id="a_15">General  Clauses  Act</a>.    But  that  is not the case with     
Sec.17(A).  Sec.17(A) deals merely with the deferral.  It does not in any
manner wipe out or reduce the tax liability.   The  only  result  of  the
deferral  would be that the tax-payer would be spared of the liability to
pay the interest for which under  the  scheme  of  the  Act  there  is  a
different provision  in  shape of Sec.24.  Therefore, the decision, which
deals essentially with Sec.17 and an entirely different  kind  of  power,
could not  be  made applicable to the facts of the present case.  In case
of Sec.17(3) there is a specific indication that  power  under  Sec.17(3)
shall  not  be  used  retrospectively,  whereas there is no such specific
section in case of Sec.17(A) and the advantage of  Sec.15  of  the  Tamil
Nadu  General  Clauses  Act would always be available to the notification
issued under Sec.17(A).  Therefore, the decision is of no consequence  in      
so far as the present controversy is concerned.
</p>
<p id="p_48">                12.   The  question  then remains about the retrospective
effect of the notification and the withdrawal  of  the  alleged  benefits
granted under  G.O.Ms.Nos.5  and  62  with  retrospective effect.  In our
opinion, considering the language of G.O.Ms.No.5, it cannot be said  that
a  ceiling-less  tax  deferral  was  granted under that Government Order. 
Therefore, this would be a case where a certain  advantage  for  tax  was
conferred on  the  tax-payer and is being then withdrawn.  The tax-payer,
in this case the petitioner company, knew well what  it  had  sought  and
what  was  intended  to give to it and what it actually got by way of tax
deferral.  Under this factual background  if  ultimately  by  issuing  G.
O.Ms.Nos.18  and  31 certain clarifications alone were made, it cannot be
said that the earlier notification  was  being  varied  or  cancelled  or
modified.  It   was   merely   being   explained.    What  was  given  by
notifications vide G.O.Ms.Nos.5 and 62  was  in  no  manner  lessened  by
G.O.Ms.   Nos.18  and  31 and that is how the parties understood the same       
though, of course, the petitioner company changed its stand to  take  the
advantage of the omission of the figure in G.O.Ms.No.5 or G.O.Ms.  No.62.
A  complete  tax deferral for one year was never a stand or even a demand
of the petitioner company.  It cannot,  therefore,  be  allowed  to  take       
advantage  of  some  omission  and  to  inflate  its  advantage which was
meticulously calculated to help it to revive.  Therefore, the decision of
the Division Bench in  Kannabiran  Steel  Re-rolling  Mills  case,  cited
supra, cannot  help  the  petitioner.    Once  this  view is taken of the
matter, it is not necessary for us to consider  the  argument  that  even
with  the aid of Sec.15 of the Tamil Nadu General Clauses Act, it was not
possible  for  the  State  Government  to  vary,  amend  or  cancel   the
notification issued by it with retrospective effect.  Once the subsequent
notification  is held not to be having the retrospective effect the whole
edifice of the argument has to necessary fall.  The factual aspect of the
development that took place make it abundantly clear that right from  the
beginning, that  is  at the stage of G.O.Ms.  Nos.5 and 62 what was given
was only the tax deferral of 1246 lakhs.
</p><p id="p_49">                13.  It is at this place that  we  must  comment  on  the 
bona fide  aspect  of the petitioner company.  We must say from all the
facts  which  have  been  culled   out   in   the   judgment   that   the
petitioner-company  completely  lacks  in bona fide at least in so far as
these  writ   petitions   are   concerned   or   in   so   far   as   the
petitioner-companys  prayer  regarding  G.O.Ms.Nos.18  and 31 concerned.  
Even  at  the  cost  of  repetition,  we  may  repeat  that  it  was  the
petitioner-company  who  itself made overtures to the IDBI after it found   
that the first scheme issued by the BIFR was of no consequence on account 
of the elapse of time.  The petitioner-company who had already  paid  the
taxes which were deferred for the period from 1-1-1993 to 30-6-1993.  The
petitioner-company  then  in no uncertain terms approadhed the IDBI which
was the operating agency appointed by  the  BIFr  and  highlighted  its
additional  liabilities  of  Rs.468 lakhs plus Rs.155 lakhs on account of
the explanation of the petitioner-companys activities and the arrears of
excise duty respectively.  Their representative also went to the BIFR for
the change in the language because the petitioner company had  then  felt
that the  six  months  deferral  would  not  be  enough.   The six months
deferral was also estimated at Rs.623 lakhs only which would  be  on  the
basis of the information supplied by the petitioner company alone.  Again
on  account  of  the  additional outlay of Rs.623 lakhs, to which we have
made a reference earlier, the petitioner-company sought for one  year  s
time  instead  of  six months as it though that one years period of time
would be enough during which its tax liabilities could grow  to  Rs.1246 
lakhs.   What  we  are at pains to see is that when the first order dated
8-12-1993   came   before   the   BIFR,   though   at   that   time   the
petitioner-company  had  committed  itself  in  terms  of  its additional     
demands of Rs.623 lakhs only and though the  BIFR  chose  to  change  the
order  and  that too at the instance of the petitioner-company alone, the
petitioner-company took an  attitude  of  a  chameleon  by  changing  its
colour,  taking the advantage of the BIFR not mentioning the exact amount
of the total deferral which  it  had  done  in  the  earlier  order,  the
petitioner company tried to grab more and more advantage in a most unfair
manner.   We  have  referred to the whole correspondence in great details     
only to show that right from the beginning it was petitioners  companys
own  demand  of  Rs.1246 lakhs and it could not be imagined that the BIFR       
would grant them a tax-deferral of one years time  without  providing  a
ceiling therefor.    On  this  backdrop  the  petitioner company had been
acting in an unfair manner.  At least  we  could  say  that  there  is  a
complete  lack of bona fides in the stand taken by the petitioner-company
that the BIFR order and  the  subsequent  Government  Order,  G.O.Ms.No.5  
followed by G.O.Ms.No.62 had provided a ceiling-less tax deferral for one
full year.
</p>
<p id="p_50">                14.  Things   did   not   stop  here.    Even  after  the
petitioner-company was threatened with the coercive action because of its
non-payment of the taxes and after the State Government realised that the
petitioner-company had taken advantage of more than Rs.1246 lakhs and had 
not paid  the  taxes  therefor,  the  petitioner-company  started  taking
calculated  steps  in  order  to  avoid  the ire of the Government or its
coercive action the petitioner-company had  clearly  agreed  to  pay  the
whole arrears in two instalments without, of course committing as to what
the quantum  of each instalment would be.  The first instalment of Rs.4,9
4,20,141/- was made by the petitioner-company on  10-1-1997.    This  was
also a  belated  payment.    The  petitioner-company then had to make the
payments of the remaining instalment of  Rs.5.89  lakhs  on  14-3-199  7.
Before  that, the petitioner-company wrote a completely misleading letter
that it wanted to wipe out the main liability of the  loan  amounting  to
Rs.5.52  lakhs  and  for  that purpose offered to pay approximately Rs.57      
lakhs to complete the main tax liability.    In  fact,  this  letter  was
completely   misleading   because  the  petitioner  company  had  already
committed and accepted the offer by the petitioner  company  to  pay  the
whole arrears, that is the tax arrears and the interest accrued thereupon
in  two  instalments and it also paid the first instalment and had bought
time thereby.  It was really strange that this design on the part of  the
petitioner-company  should not have been realised by the State Government
which merely directed the petitioner-company later on to pay Rs.57 lakhs.
However, fortunately before us the petitioner-company  had  already  paid
the  second  instalment  obviously  to avoid the penal or coercive action
against it by the State Government.  After having made the payment of the
second instalment on 14-3-1997, the petitioner-company again changed  its
stand  and  says that the second instalment should be towards the arrears
of tax for the month of February.  All this suggests a clear-cut attitude
on the part of the petitioner-company to avoid the taxes.
</p>

<p id="p_51">                15.  It was tried to be argued before us that  since  the
Government  had accepted and directed the petitioner-company to pay Rs.57 
lakhs in effect, the Government  had  agreed  as  if  to  write  off  the
interest amounting to  more than Rs.4 crores.  We do not agree.  In fact,
even the Government had directed the petitioner-company later on  to  pay
Rs.57  lakhs  of  rupees in terms of its offer earlier made on 11-3-1997.
It cannot be forgotten that on 14-3-1997 it had made the payment of  next
instalment  and thereby its past liability of the taxes and the interest
was wiped off.  It was too much on the  part  of  the  petitioner-company
then  to  turn back and say that the second payment on 14-3-19 97 was not
towards the second instalment but towards the tax liability for the month
of February which liability was never in question.  All this takes us  to
hold  that  in  this  case  the petitioner-company does not have any bona
fides.  The petitions must fail even on that count.
</p>
<p id="p_52">                16.   The  learned  counsel   lastly   argue   that   the
legislative  intention  of  the  taxing statute is irrelevant and what is
relevant is the language thereof.   According  to  the  learned  counsel,
therefore,  the formal notification under Sec.17(A) vide G.O.Ms.No.62 did
not provide any limit and, therefore, it must be presumed  that  by  that
notification,  a ceiling-less tax deferral for the full year was granted.
The learned counsel, therefore, argues that the  subsequent  notification
under Sec.17-A  vide G.O.Ms.No.62 was clearly impermissible.  The learned
counsel argues this on the basis of  the  theory  that  even  if  it  was
understood by the petitioner company that the tax deferral was limited to
Rs.1246  lakhs  and even if it was intended by the said notification that   
intention will be of no consequence and the language of the notifications
should alone be relevant.  The  learned  counsel  also  argues  that  the
subsequent  notification  cannot be viewed as clarification as there does
not appear anything in G.O.Ms.No.18 suggesting  any  such  clarification.     
On  the  other hand, the learned counsel points out that the rationale of   
G.O.Ms.No.18 is that since Rs.623 lakhs tax deferral was provided for six
months, the tax deferral for one year would be  exactly  the  double  the
amount, i.e.  Rs.1246 lakhs.
</p>
<p id="p_53">                17.  We do not agree.  There is a clear-cut reference  to
the  proceedings  of  BIFR  and  the  amount of Rs.1246 lakhs having been
worked out.  There is also a reference made in G.O.Ms.No.18 to  a  letter
written by the petitioner company requesting the Government to permit the
petitioner  company for availing the deferral of sales-tax from 1-10-1993
to 30-9-1994 as approved by the BIFR.  The  words  as  approved  by  the
BIFR would signify that the petitioner company itself had sought the tax
deferral benefit  of Rs.1246 lakhs only.  In the letter dated 4-8-1993 by
the petitioner company also  there  is  a  reference  to  the  words  as
approved by  the  BIFR  in  the penultimate portion.  Therefore, all the
Government Orders would have to be read in the light  of  the  words  as
approved by  the  BIFR.  Since the notifications under Sec.17 (A) of the
Tamil Nadu General Sales Tax Act like G.O.Ms.Nos.31 and 62 have  emanated         
only out  of the aforementioned Government Orders, i.e.  G.O.Ms.Nos.5 and  
18, they cannot be read de hors  the  instruments  which  have  conceived 
them.  Paragraph  3  of  the  Government  Order, G.O.Ms.  No.18, is clear
enough for that proposition.  Therefore, the criticism that the  language
of  the aforementioned Government Order suggests a ceiling-less sales-tax
deferral for one  full  year  and,  therefore,  the  intendment  of  such
Government Order  should  be ignored cannot be accepted.  In our opinion,
since  G.O.Ms.No.62  and  G.O.Ms.No.31  have  to  be  read   along   with     
G.O.Ms.Nos.5 and 18 respectively, such contention has to be rejected.
</p>
<p id="p_54">                18.   For  all  these reasons, the writ petitions have no
merits and they are, accordingly, dismissed but without any orders as  to
the costs.  W.M.P.  Nos.18935 to 18938 of 1998 are closed.
