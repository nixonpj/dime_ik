THIS BAIL APPLICATION HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON 27.02.2019,
THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING:
 BA:954/2019                          2




                                 ORDER
</pre>

<p id="p_1">      This application is filed under Section 439 of the Cr.P.C.


</p><p id="p_2">      2.      The applicant herein is the accused in S.C.No.747 of 2018

on the file of the Court for Atrocities against Women and Children

(Additional Sessions Court-I), Kasaragod.
</p>
<p id="p_3">
</p><p id="p_4">      3.      The victim is a minor child aged 5 years. She was staying

along with her family in the same building as the applicant. According

to the prosecution, on 31.8.2018 and on various days thereafter, the

child was subjected to perverted sexual abuse by the applicant herein.

When she felt pain in her private parts, she complained to her mother.

She was taken to the Doctor and the medical examination report

probabilized the case of the child. Her statement was recorded by the

learned Magistrate wherein she reiterated the allegations. The

applicant was arrested in connection with the aforesaid Crime on

11.9.2018 and he remains in custody.         His earlier application was

dismissed by this Court by order dated 22.1.2019.


</p><p id="p_5">      5.      The learned counsel appearing for the applicant submitted

that while dismissing the earlier application, this Court had directed
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1"> BA:954/2019                           3</span>



the applicant to move the court below if the trial is unduly delayed.

He would submit that he sought for bail before the court below, but

the same was dismissed. According to the learned counsel, the long

period in custody of the applicant is a sufficient enough reason to

release him on bail as a person on bail has a better chance to defend

his case than a person in custody. He would assert that the applicant

is innocent.
</p>
<p id="p_6">
</p><p id="p_7">         6.    The learned Public Prosecutor has strenuously opposed the

prayer.       It is submitted that a minor child was subjected to gross

sexual abuse and the allegations are grave.             If the applicant is

released, he would definitely tamper with the evidence and terrorize

the child and her family members.          It is submitted that pursuant to

the directions issued by this court, the case has been scheduled for

trial.
</p>
<p id="p_8">
</p><p id="p_9">         7.    I have considered the submissions advanced and have

perused the materials that are made available.         There cannot be any

doubt that the allegations are extremely grave. The victim is a minor

child aged 5 years. Prima facie, there are materials which show that

the involvement of the applicant.         All these aspects were considered

by this Court while dismissing the earlier application. There has been
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2"> BA:954/2019                            4</span>



no substantial change in circumstances.             It is by now settled that

being under custody for an extended period is not a ground for release

on bail, particularly in cases which involve grave offences (see <a href="/doc/818011/" id="a_1">Rajesh

Ranjan Yadav @ Pappu Yadav v. CBI</a> through its Director

[(2007) 1 SCC 70] and <a href="/doc/114457030/" id="a_2">Ash Mohammad v. Shiv Raj Singh @ Lalla

Babu and another</a> [(2012) 9 SCC 446].
</p>
<p id="p_10">
</p><p id="p_11">         I direct the learned Special Judge to expedite the proceedings

and take the matter to its logical conclusion at the earliest.
