<p id="p_1">              (PER : HONOURABLE MR.JUSTICE G.B.SHAH)


</p><p id="p_2">1.    Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with                    the judgment and
award dated 27-8-2007 passed by the Motor Accident Claims
Tribunal(Aux.), F.T.C.No.2, Mehsana, (hereinafter referred to as
'the learned Tribunal' for short) in Motor Accident Claim Petition
No.643 of 2004 by which the learned Tribunal has partly allowed
the   said   claim       petition    and    has      awarded a      total     sum of
Rs.8,66,000/- towards compensation for the death of deceased-
Niyazkhan Pathan, the appellants herein-original claimants have
preferred    present       First    Appeal      to   enhance      the   amount     of
compensation awarded by the learned Tribunal.
</p>

<p id="p_3">2.    Facts leading to filing of present First Appeal in short are
that in a vehicular accident which took place on 26-1-2004,
deceased-Niyazkhan           Pathan     was       riding   his    scooter     bearing
registration No.GJ-6-N-4973 for going towards Nimeta along with
his wife. When they reached near Ajwa Cross Roads, the deceased
halted his scooter for crossing the road towards Nimeta, at that
time, a truck bearing registration No.KA-01-D-2359 which was
coming from Mumbai driven by its driver-original opponent No.1
dashed with his scooter causing the deceased and his wife to fall
off from the scooter and sustaining serious injuries to the deceased
and thereafter he succumbed to the injuries on the next day while
taking the treatment in the hospital.                   Therefore, the original
claimants, his widow, minor children and mother, filed the claim

         C/FA/2793/2008                              JUDGMENT




petition before the learned Tribunal claiming Rs.25,00,000/-
towards compensation for the death of the deceased.
</p>

<p id="p_4">2.1      It was the case on behalf of the original claimants that at
the time of accident, the deceased was aged 52 years and was
serving with      the Gujarat State Forest Development Corporation
as    Manager earning a monthly salary of Rs.15,060/- and his
revised pay was Rs.19,000/-. It was also the case on behalf of the
claimants that had the deceased survived till his retirement, he
would have       drawn a gross salary of Rs.40,000/- per month in
addition to other benefits such as provident fund of Rs.1,85,166/-,
gratuity of Rs.3,50,000/- and leave encashment. Therefore, the
original claimants claimed a total sum of Rs.25,00,000/- towards
compensation        under different heads towards the death of the
deceased.
</p>

<p id="p_5">2.2      The claim petition was opposed by the Insurance Company
of the truck involved in the accident by filing written statement at
Exh.12 denying the averments and allegation made in the claim
petition. It was alternatively contended that had the deceased been
driving his scooter in a proper manner, the accident could have
been averted. It was also contended that the accident had occurred
due to contributory negligence wherein the deceased was a larger
contributory to the same.
</p>

<p id="p_6">2.3      The learned Tribunal framed the issues at Exh.18.
</p>

<p id="p_7">2.4      On appreciation of oral as well as documentary evidences,
the learned Tribunal has held that the driver of truck-original
opponent No.1 was contributory negligent to the extent of 90% and
the deceased was contributory negligent to the extent of 10%.</p><pre id="pre_2">

           C/FA/2793/2008                                   JUDGMENT




2.5       To prove the income of the deceased, the claimants have
</pre><p id="p_8">examined one Shri Anand Dashrathlal Joshi, who is an employee of
Gujarat State Forest Development Corporation Ltd., at Exh.35. The
claimants have also produced service record as well as details of
salary and other benefits. On appreciation of oral as well as
documentary evidence on record, the learned Tribunal has
considered net salary of the deceased at the time of accident at
Rs.16,218/- per month. Considering the statement of salary of the
deceased produced at Exh.40, the learned Tribunal has held that if
the deceased would have survived, he would have served till his
retirement and would have drawn a net salary of Rs.26,307/- per
month at the time of retirement and taking the mean salary, the
learned Tribunal has considered average salary of Rs.21,262/- per
month     and     considering   the      deduction   towards   income   tax,
prospective monthly salary income of the deceased was considered
by the learned Tribunal at Rs.19,000/-. After deducting one-third
towards     personal expenses of the deceased, dependency benefit
was assessed at Rs.12,670/- per month i.e. Rs.1,52,040/- per
annum. Thereafter applying the multiplier of 6, the learned
Tribunal has awarded Rs.9,12,240/- towards loss of dependency.
Thereafter, the learned Tribunal has awarded a further sum of
Rs.15,000/- towards medical expenses, Rs.10,000/- towards loss to
estate, Rs.20,000/- towards loss of consortium and Rs.5,000/-
towards funeral expenses. After deducting 10% towards the
contributory       negligence   of     the deceased,   by the    impugned
judgment and award,         the learned Tribunal has awarded a total
sum of Rs.8,66,016/- (rounded off to Rs.8,66,000/-) to the original
claimants with interest @ 7.5% p.a. from the date of application
till realization.</p><pre id="pre_3">

<p id="p_10">3.          Mr.Hakim, learned advocate appearing on behalf of the
appellants-original claimants, has vehemently submitted that in the
facts and circumstances of the case, the learned Tribunal has
materially erred in holding the original opponent No.1-driver of the
truck contributory negligent to the extent of 90% and the
deceased-scooterist contributory negligent to the extent of 10%. It
is submitted that considering the violent impact of the accident,
the deceased was thrown off from the scooter and suffered
grievous head injury and therefore, the learned Tribunal ought to
have held that the original opponent No.1-driver of truck was
solely negligent for causing the accident.
</p>

<p id="p_11">3.1          Mr.Hakim, learned advocate appearing on behalf of the
appellants-original claimants, has further submitted that the
learned Tribunal has materially erred in considering income of the
deceased at the time of accident at Rs.19,000/- per month. It is
further submitted that while awarding future economic loss, the
learned Tribunal has not considered the fact that if the deceased
had survived, he would have continued in service till his retirement
and therefore, salary income of the deceased ought to have been
considered atleast at Rs.21,436/- per month.
</p>

<p id="p_12">3.2          It is further submitted that that considering the fact
that the deceased at the time of accident was aged 52 years, the

<p id="p_13">3.3          It is further submitted by Mr.Hakim, learned advocate
appearing on behalf of the appellants-original claimants, that the
learned Tribunal has materially erred in awarding Rs.20,000/-
towards loss of consortium and Rs.10,000/- towards loss to estate.
It is submitted that the learned Tribunal ought to have awarded at
least Rs.1,00,000/- towards loss of consortium, loss of love and
affection and loss to estate in view of the decision of this Court
rendered in First Appeal No.3894 of 2006.
</p>

<p id="p_14">3.4          It is further submitted that     the learned Tribunal has
materially erred in awarding interest @ 7.5% per annum. It is
submitted that considering the rate of interest prevailing at the
relevant time and considering the facts and circumstances of the
case, the learned Tribunal ought to have awarded interest @ 9%
per annum. No other submissions have been made. Making             the
above submissions,       it is requested to allow the First Appeal
preferred by the original claimants and enhance the amount of
compensation awarded by the learned Tribunal.
</p>

<p id="p_15">4.           Mr.Vibhuti Nanavati, learned advocate, appearing on
behalf of the original opponent No.3-insurance company has
vehemently submitted that the learned Tribunal has materially
erred in holding original opponent No.1-driver of the truck
contributory negligent to the extent of 90% and the deceased-
scooterist contributory negligent only to the extent of 10%.

Tribunal has materially erred in considering the dependency at
Rs.19,000/- per month in awarding future economic loss especially
when salary of the deceased at the time of accident was
Rs.15,060/- per month only.
</p>

<p id="p_17">4.2          Mr.Nanavati learned advocate appearing on behalf of
the insurance company, has fairly conceded that as per the
decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court                       in the case of Sarla
Verma (supra), as the deceased was aged 52 years at the
time of accident, multiplier of 11 ought to have been awarded
instead of 6 as applied by the learned Tribunal .

passed by the learned Tribunal and have re-appreciated the entire
evidences on record.

<p id="p_20">7.         From the impugned judgment and award passed by the
learned Tribunal, it appears that                    the learned Tribunal has
awarded    a     total    sum   of    Rs.8,66,016/-         (Rs.9,62,240/-   minus
Rs.96,224/- being 10% contributory negligence of the deceased)
under different heads to the original claimants for the death of the
deceased with            interest @ 7.5% p.a. from the date of the

7.1          While awarding future economic loss, the learned
Tribunal has considered the income of the deceased at the time
accident at Rs.19,000/- p.m. Considering the oral evidence of Shri
Anand Dashrathlal Joshi, who is an employee of Gujarat State
Forest Development Corporation Ltd. and who has been examined
at Exh.35 and documentary evidence, more particularly, the salary
certificate produced at Exh.40, the learned Tribunal ought to have
considered income of the deceased at Rs.18,822/- per month
[Rs.18,931/- + Rs.1971/-(PF contribution) = Rs.20,902/- p.m. -
Rs.2080/-(income tax and professional tax)]. As per the decision of
the Hon'ble Supreme Court                in the case of Sarla Verma
(supra), considering the dependents of the deceased,             one-
fourth i.e. Rs.4,705/- p.m. ought to have been deducted towards
personal expenses of the deceased. As the deceased was aged 52
years at the time of accident, as per the decision of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in the case of Sarla Verma(supra), a multiplier
of 11 was required to be applied instead of 6 as awarded by the
learned Tribunal. Thus, loss of dependency would come to
Rs.18,63,444/- per annum instead of Rs.9,12,240/- as awarded by
the learned Tribunal.

<p id="p_22">7.2          Now so far as the amounts awarded under the
conventional heads i.e. loss of consortium, loss to estate and loss of
love and affection and funeral expenses are concerned, it appears
that   the learned Tribunal has awarded a sum of Rs.20,000/-
towards loss of consortium, Rs.10,000/- towards loss to estate and
Rs.5,000/- towards funeral expenses. As per the decisions of the

Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Sarla Verma (supra) as
well as the decision of the Division Bench of this Court in First
Appeal 3894 of 2006 rendered on 14-10-2014, the claimants shall
be entitled to Rs.1,10,000/- in all towards the loss of consortium,
loss to estate, loss of love and affection and funeral expenses.

<p id="p_23">8.           Thus, the original claimants shall be entitled to a total
compensation of Rs.19,73,444/-. Deducting 10% towards the
contributory negligence of the deceased-scooterist, the amount
comes to Rs.17,76,100/- which the claimants shall be entitled to
recover from the insurance company with             interest @ 9% per
annum from the date of application till realization.

<p id="p_24">9.           In view of the above and for the reasons stated above,
present First Appeal succeeds. The impugned judgment and award
passed by the learned Tribunal is hereby modified to the aforesaid
extent and it is held that the appellants shall be entitled to a total
compensation of Rs.17,76,100/-. The learned Tribunal has awarded
a total sum of Rs.8,66,000/-. Thus, the claimants shall be entitled to
additional/enhanced compensation of Rs.9,10,100/-. It is reported
that the claimants have paid the court fees in the present appeal
on Rs.6,00,000/- only. However, when it is held that the claimants
shall   be    entitled   to   additional/enhanced    compensation    of
Rs.9,10,100/-, to deny any amount above Rs.6,00,000/- would cause
injustice to the claimants. It cannot be disputed that the claimants
are entitled to just compensation. Under the circumstances, on
payment of additional court fees on the additional amount of
Rs.3,10,100/- with the Registry of this Court within a period of ten
days from today, the claimants shall be entitled to additional
compensation as determined hereinabove i.e. Rs.9,10,100/- from
the original opponents with interest @ 9% p.a. thereon from the
