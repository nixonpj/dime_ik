                              W. P. (L) No. 1406 of 2010
        Employers in relation to the Management of Kusunda Area No. VI of M/S Bharat
        Coking Coal Limited, Dhanbad, through Anoop Kumar Sengupta, Chief General
        Manager, Kusunda Area No. VI of M/S B.C.C.L, Dhanbad           ..... Petitioner

                                     PRESENT
                  HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE NARENDRA NATH TIWARI
                                         -----
        For the Petitioner         - Mr. A.K.Mehta
        For the Respondents         - Mr. Ashutosh Anand
                                         -----

By Court:      In this writ petition, the petitioner has challenged the award dated 29.10.2008</pre>

<p id="p_1">        (Annexure-3) rendered by learned Central Government Industrial Tribunal No. I,

        Dhanbad in Reference Case No. 128/1999, whereby learned Tribunal has answered

        the said reference in favour of the respondent No.2-concened workman.

</p><p id="p_2">        2.     The short fact of the case is that Jagat Bahadur was a permanent employee of

        M/S B.C.C.L posted as Night Guard at Godhar Colliery. In 1991, he was declared

        medically unfit and was stopped from duty w.e.f 17.9.1991. According to the

        provisions contained in Clause 9.4.0 of National Coal Wage Agreement - V (NCWA-

        V), which provides for compassionate appointment to a dependant of such employee,

        Chandrakala Devi (respondent No.2), the only living wife of Jagat Bahadur, applied for

        her compassionate appointment in place of Jagat Bahadur on 26.9.1991. The

        Management kept the said application pending for several years. Chandrakala Devi,

        thereafter, raised a dispute which was ultimately referred to learned Tribunal and has

        been answered by the impugned award.
</p>
<p id="p_3">        3.     It is relevant to mention here that Jagat Bahadur appeared before the

        Management and requested for giving employment to Chandrakala Devi stating that

        she is her only alive wife. The said fact has also been admitted by the Management in

        its written statement filed before learned Tribunal.
</p>
<p id="p_4">        4.     The Management contested the said reference on the ground that the name of

        Chandrakala Devi is not mentioned in the list of the dependants in the service

        excerpts of Jagat Bahadur, which was prepared in the year 1987. She is a stranger

        and is not entitled to get employment under the provision of Clause 9.4.0 of NCWA-V.

</p><p id="p_5">        5.     Both the parties adduced evidences in the said reference case.
</p><p id="p_6"> 6.    After thorough discussion and consideration of the facts, evidences and

materials on record, learned Tribunal held that the action of the Management in not

providing employment to the only alive second wife Chandrakala Devi in place of

Jagat Bahadur, Ex-Night Guard of Godhar Colliery under Clause 9.4.0 of NCWA-V, is

not justified and she is entitled for employment under the Management.

</p><p id="p_7">7.    Mr. A. K. Mehta, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner-

Management, submitted that though the said award is challenged in this writ petition,

the Management, subsequently, took decision to implement the said award. However,

when Chandrakala Devi was sent to the Medical Board for that purpose on

15.12.2009, she was found aged about 47 years and six months. Learned counsel

further submitted that in view of the said medical report, she is overaged for that

purpose and is not entitled to get employment. She may be given monetary

compensation.
</p>
<p id="p_8">8.    Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent No.2 - concerned

workman, replying to the said contentions of learned counsel for the petitioner,

submitted that valuable right of the concerned workman to get compassionate

appointment, cannot be taken away due to negligence and laches on the part of the

Management.     Admittedly,   when   the   concerned    workman    had   applied   for

compassionate appointment on 26.9.1991, she was aged below 30 years and was

eligible for getting employment. Her application was kept pending for several years by

the Management. Thereafter, the concerned workman raised a dispute and ultimately

the said dispute was decided in Reference Case No. 128/1999 by learned Central

Government Industrial Tribunal No.1, Dhanbad holding that the concerned workman is

entitled to get employment and that the action of the Management in not providing

employment, is wholly unjustified.
</p>
<p id="p_9">9.    Learned counsel submitted that in a number of judicial pronouncements, it has

been clearly held that the compassionate appointment cannot be denied on the

ground of being over age on the date of consideration, whereas the concerned

workman was well within the prescribed age on the date of making the application and

is entitled to get employment. Learned counsel referred to and relied on the decisions

of this Court in Pradeep Kumar Vs. Mineral Area Development Authority,
 Dhanbad &amp; Ors. [2005(3) JLJR 275] and Sri Kheman Mahato Vs. M/S B.C.C.L,

Dhanbad &amp; Ors. [2007(2) JLJR 344].
</p>
<p id="p_10">10.    Learned counsel further submitted that when the Management decided to

implement the award, the Medical Board had no jurisdiction to put any objection on the

ground of being over aged. Such objection is redundant in view of the terms of the

award and the decision of the Management. Since the concerned workman is entitled

to get compassionate appointment, there is no question of giving any monetary

compensation. Once the Management has taken decision to implement the award,

they cannot back out from the said decision on frivolous grounds.

</p><p id="p_11">11.    I have heard learned counsel for the parties and considered the facts and

materials on record.
</p>
<p id="p_12">12.    On perusal of the impugned award, I find that it is a thoroughly discussed and

well reasoned award. Learned Tribunal has answered the reference in favour of the

concerned workman (Chandrakala Devi) and has held that the action of the

Management in not providing employment to Chandrakala Devi in place of Jagat

Bahadur, Ex-Night Guard, is unjustified.
</p>
<p id="p_13">13.    Since the Management has already taken decision to implement the impugned

award, it is futile to go into the merit of the objections raised against the impugned

award in this writ petition.
</p>
<p id="p_14">14.    Once the decision has already been taken by the Management to implement

the impugned award, there is no question of deviation therefrom on an observation of

the Medical Board, which is constituted only for medical examination. The

recommendation of the Medical Board has nothing to do with the decision of the

Management. Particularly, in the matter of implementation of an award the same

cannot be taken as an impediment, as has been said by the Management.

</p><p id="p_15">15.    Even otherwise, the relief which has been granted in the impugned award

cannot be denied by the Management on the ground of being over-aged on the date of

medical examination. The date of medical examination has no relevance in the

context. The limitation is for the purpose of making claim i.e. for filing an application

and not for medical examination.
</p><p id="p_16"> 16.    In the case of Pradeep Kumar, supra, it has been clearly held that the relevant

date for consideration of age factor is the date of application, not the date of

consideration of the application.
</p>
<p id="p_17">17.    In view of the above discussions, this writ petition is disposed of holding that

once the Management having decided to implement the impugned award, the plea

taken by the Management, showing inability i.e. the medical report showing the

concerned workman as over-aged on the date of the medical examination, is

absolutely irrelevant and contrary to the above settled principle of law.

</p><p id="p_18">18.    The Management once having already taken decision to implement the

impugned award, shall proceed further with his decision, ignoring the contrary

recommendation of the Medical Board on the point of age of the concerned workman.

</p><p id="p_19">19.    Since the matter is pretty old, the Management shall pass appropriate order for

implementing the impugned award within two months from the date of receipt /

production of a copy of this judgment.
</p>
<p id="p_20">

</p><p id="p_21">                                                 (NARENDRA NATH TIWARI, J)
