:ORDER  
</pre>

<p id="p_1">        This Criminal Original petition is filed to call for records pertaining
to the proceedings in charge sheet in PRC.No.43 of 2017 on the file of the
learned Judicial Magistrate, Melur and to quash the same as illegal.
</p>
<p id="p_2">        2. Heard the learned counsel appearing for the petitioners and the
learned Government Advocate(Criminal side) appearing for the first respondent
and the learned counsel appearing for the second respondent.
</p>
<p id="p_3">        3. On the basis of complaint given by the second respondent, against
the petitioners, a case was registered in Crime No.74 of 2017 on the file of
the first respondent for the offences under <a href="/doc/1258372/" id="a_2">Sections
147</a>,<a href="/doc/763672/" id="a_3">148</a>,<a href="/doc/1198799/" id="a_4">294(b)</a>,<a href="/doc/175699/" id="a_5">336</a>,<a href="/doc/513074/" id="a_6">109</a>,<a href="/doc/222396/" id="a_7">427</a>, <a href="/doc/180217/" id="a_8">506(ii)</a> of IPC r/w. 3(2) (Va) SC/ST POA Act 2015.
After the registration of First Information Report, the first respondent has
proceeded to file final report, by arraying the petitioners herein as accused
in PRC.No.43 of 2017  on the file of the learned Judicial Magistrate, Melur.
</p>
<p id="p_4">        4. It appears that at the advise of the elders and friends, the
petitioners and second respondent have amicably settled their dispute out of
Court and also the Joint Compromise Memo, dated 21.08.2017, signed by the  
parties in the presence of their respective counsels is produced before this
Court.  As per the Joint Compromise Memo, the defacto complainant, namely, 
second respondent has agreed to withdraw the criminal complaint and he has
also given his consent to quash the entire proceedings culminating in
PRC.No.43 of 2017 in favour of the petitioners.
</p>
<p id="p_5">        5. The parties appeared before this Court and expressed in unequivocal
terms that they have signed in the Joint Compromise Memo on their own will
and volition.  The identities of the parties (except 12th petitioner) are
verified with reference to the authenticated documents produced by the
parties before this Court.  The identities of the parties are also confirmed
by the learned Government Advocate (Criminal side) through the first
respondent police. With regard to the identity of the 12th petitioner his
name is shown as Thavam, S/o. Ramar, in the cause title, but, the identity
produced by the 12th petitioner reveals that his real name is Ravikumar.
Since the identity of the 12th petitioner verified and confirmed by the
counsel for the accused, the same is accepted.
</p>
<p id="p_6">        6. Having regard to the agreement made between the parties, this Court
is of the view that no useful purpose will be served by keeping this matter
pending. As per the Compromise Memo signed by the parties, the defacto 
complainant, namely, the second respondent has agreed to quash the 
proceedings against the petitioners. Hence the criminal proceedings
culminating in PRC.No.43 of 2017 on the file of the learned Judicial
Magistrate, Melur, is quashed in toto and the Joint Compromise Memo signed by 
the parties shall form part of the order.       
</p>        
<p id="p_7">        7. Accordingly, the Criminal Original petition is allowed.
Consequently, connected Miscellaneous petitions are closed.
