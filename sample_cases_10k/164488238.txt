</p><p id="p_2">1.           Date of accident in this case is 4.12.2005. Injured at the time of the
accident was going on his motorcycle bearing no. DL-7SX-5310. At about 1.30 pm
when he reached near Bihari Colony his motorcycle was hit by TSR No.
DL-1RH-1642 driven allegedly in a rash and negligent manner by driver Hem Pal R1.
As a result of this impact petitioner received injury on ankle and other part of the


Suit No. 736/08                                                                     1/5
 body. He was brought to SDN Hospital, Shahdara, Delhi. His MLC was prepared
vide No. 5958058 showing swelling in ankle and abrasions.
</p>

<p id="p_3">2.           One FIR No. 279/337 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_1">IPC</a> was registered vide FIR No. 522/05 at PS
Krishna Nagar on the statement of injured.
</p>

<p id="p_4">3.           This claim petition has been brought by the petitioner against driver,
owner of the offending TSR and also against the insurance company.            All the
respondents have filed their written statement. Insurance company is not disputing
the correctness of the insurance policy. The stand of the insurance company is that
there was a time gap in renewal of the driving license. Ex.R3W1/A is the driving
license of R1 which was issued on 29.4.2002 and was valid upto 28.4.2005 and was
renewed on 23.9.2006 and was valid upto 22.9.2009.            The date of accident
according to insurance company in the present case is 4.12.2005 and according to
him there was no driving license on the date of the accident with the driver of the
offending TSR. On this basis the counsel submits that insurance company be given
recovery rights.
</p>

<p id="p_5">4.           Based on the pleadings following issues have been framed vide order
dated 8.12.2007 to the following effect.
</p><p id="p_6">                                      ISSUES
</p><p id="p_7">1.           Whether the petitioner proves that he suffered injuries in the road
             accident dated 4.12.05, involving vehicle no. DL-1RH-1642, within the
             jurisdiction of PS Krishna Nagar, driven by its driver in a rash
             negligent manner?
</p><p id="p_8">2.           Whether the petitioner is entitled for any compensation, if so to what
             amount and from whom?
</p><p id="p_9">3.           Relief.
</p>

<p id="p_10">5.           Petitioner has been examined as PW1. He has filed his affidavit which is
Ex.PW1/A. Insurance company has examined three witnesses. Two officials of the

Suit No. 736/08                                                                   2/5
 insurance company have proved the copy of the insurance policy and also notice
dated 3.8.2010 sent by the company through registered AD upon the widow of the
owner under Order 12 Rule 8 CPC. A witness has been summoned by the insurance
company from the office of RTO Surajmal Vihar, Delhi and has been examined as
R3W1 in supports of its defence that driver was not having any driving license on
the date of the accident in question.
</p>

<p id="p_11">ISSUE NO.1
</p><p id="p_12">6.           The injured has attributed the entire rash and negligent driving to the
driver of the TSR at the time of the accident.             He has also been relying upon
criminal case record certify copy of which has been placed on record. The FIR in
this case has been registered on the statement of the injured. This accordingly
supports the case of the injured. Then at the same time MLC also supports the case
of the injured.    It shows that injured was brought to the hospital on 4.12.2005.
Certified copy of the charge sheet against the driver of the offending TSR alongwith

complete set of documents has also been placed on record. In Basant Kaur &amp; Ors. V. 
</p>
<p id="p_13">Chattar Pal Singh &amp; Ors. 2003 ACJ 369 M.P. (DB) it was held that registration of a criminal
case against the driver of the offending vehicle is enough to record the finding that the driver
of offending vehicle is responsible for causing the accident.
</p>

<p id="p_14">7.           Since there is no evidence on behalf of the driver and owner of the offending
TSR, therefore, it has to be presumed that petitioner has been able to bring on record the
sufficient evidence in order to show rash and negligent driving of TSR which has caused the
accident of the petitioner in this case. Issue no.1 is disposed of accordingly.
</p>

<p id="p_15">ISSUE NO.2
</p><p id="p_16">8.           Medical record of the injured has been proved as Ex.PW1/3 which shows
swelling on the right ankle. Since it is a case of simple injury which also founds support form
the charge sheet which has been filed u/S 279/337 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_2">IPC</a>. MLC of the injured placed on record
does not show any grievous injury on his person. Injured is allowed a sum of Rs. 10,000/-
</p>

<p id="p_17">Suit No. 736/08                                                                              3/5
 in all against general damages towards full and final compensation in the present case.
The same would meet the ends of justice. There is no medical bills submitted on record.
</p>

<p id="p_18">LIABILITY
</p><p id="p_19">9.           The counsel for the insurance company claims recovery rights in the present
case against owner of the offending TSR for the reason that there was no valid driving license
with the driver of the TSR on the date of the accident. He was also deriving support from the
statement of R3W1 summoned form the office of RTO Suraj Mal Vihar, Delhi who has
produced the record to show that license was originally issued to the driver for the period from
29.4.2002 to 28.4.2005 vide document Ex. R3W1/A and was renewed for the period from
23.9.2006 to 26.9.2006.
</p>

<p id="p_20">10.          It has been submitted by the counsel for the Insurance Company that the widow
of the owner of the offending TSR was served with a notice u/O 12 rule 8 CPC copy of which
has been proved as Ex.R3W3/1 and since neither driver nor owner of TSR has responded to
the notice or otherwise has produced a valid driving license of driver R1 on the date of the
accident, therefore, the Insurance Company be given recovery rights in the present case. This
contention is only to be rejected.      Admittedly the offending TSR was insured with
Insurance Company. The prime responsibility of the payment in the present case is of
Insurance Company unless and until Insurance Company shows that there is a breach
of the terms and conditions of the policy by the insured.
</p>

<p id="p_21">11.          The serving of the notice upon the widow under Order 12 Rule 8 CPC which is
Ex.R3W3/1 would be of no help to support the defence put forward by the Insurance
Company in the present case. First of all this notice was also required to be served upon the
driver of the offending vehicle which has not been done in the present case.          Secondly
nowhere this notice shows even the person upon whom the same has been served was even
called upon to submit any driving license of the driver.
</p>

<p id="p_22">12.          Driver R1 of the offending TSR in the present case admittedly was having a
valid driving license as originally issued to him. Nothing has been brought on record that


Suit No. 736/08                                                                              4/5
 driver has been disqualified from holding a valid driving license. Insured is only required to
show that he has allowed the driver to drive the vehicle involved in the accident confirming the
genuineness of the driving license with the driver. It cannot be supposed that owner would
also keep remember the date of expiry or renewal of the license on each and every occasion.
</p>

<p id="p_23">13.            The Insurance Company has not been able to prove any violation of the terms
and conditions of the policy. No evidence has been led by the Insurance Company that
owner had allowed the driver R1 to driver the offending TSR despite of his awareness of his
not having a valid license at the time of accident.
</p>

<p id="p_24">14.            The responsibility in the present case continues with the insurance company.
Insurance company cannot be given any recovery rights as prayed.
</p>

<p id="p_25">15.            An award of the sum of Rs. 10,000/- is passed in favour of the petitioner and
against all the respondents alongwith interest @ 7.5% from the date of filing of the petition till
realization of the amount minus the interest excepted if any.
</p>

<p id="p_26">16.            The Insurance Company is hereby directed to deposit the award amount with
up to date interest in UCO Bank, Branch Karkardooma in the name of the petitioner within
30 days from the date of this award under intimation to the petitioner and to this Court and
Bank would keep this amount in an account in the name of Judge MACT East and would
await for the further directions as to the disbursement     of the same till the compliance
is reported.
</p>

<p id="p_27">17.            An attested copy of this award alongwith two photographs of the petitioner be
also sent to the Bank to facilitate compliance. Put up for compliance on 8.12.2010.</p><pre id="pre_2">
