</p>
<p id="p_6">
              The Court : The petitioner is in possession of four railway properties.

According to the petitioner, the rents or occupation charges in respect of the properties

have been paid till date without any default. The petitioner complains of the railways'

attempt to increase the rents or occupation charges with retrospective effect and without

prior notice to the petitioner.   The petitioner says that in view of a Division Bench

judgment, the law as recognised in this Court does not permit such course of action.

</p><p id="p_7">              The railways claim that the Division Bench judgment would not be

applicable to these cases since the agreements contain a clause which permits

retrospective enhancement of the rent or occupation charges. Such interpretation of the

relevant clause is seriously disputed by the petitioner.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                              2</span>


</p><p id="p_8">             The railways have a claim of slightly over Rs.1.52 crore on account of

outstanding rent pursuant to the enhancement thereof in respect of the four properties.

In addition, the railways claim that a further amount of Rs.15,66,899/- is due on

account of additional security. It would be in the fitness of things, considering the

disputes that have arisen and the implication of the relevant clause, that the petitioner

be put on terms for the petitioner's continuation in occupation of the properties in

question.
</p>
<p id="p_9">             The parties have also agreed that since the primary dispute is the same, a

combined reference of the disputes be made to the Divisional Railway Manager, Eastern

Railway, Sealdah, Ms. Jaya Verma Sinha.
</p>
<p id="p_10">             The railways have indicated that they would cooperate in the reference

being concluded as expeditiously as possible and, preferably, within three months from

date. The Arbitrator will make every endeavour to conclude the reference within such

time, notwithstanding her promotion or transfer or retirement.

</p><p id="p_11">             The railways have said that they will file their composite statement of claim

within four weeks from date. The petitioner has agreed to file the counter-statement

within three weeks thereafter.
</p>
<p id="p_12">             AP No.1428 of 2015, AP No.1429 of 2015, AP No.1430 of 2015 and AP No.

1431 of 2015 are disposed of by directing that the petitioner's possession in respect of

the four properties will not be disturbed by the railways unconditionally for a period of a

fortnight from date and, thereafter, subject to a sum of Rs.77 lakh being put in on

account of the claim. The deposit of such amount and the receipt thereof will be without

prejudice to the rights and contentions of the parties in the arbitral reference.

</p><p id="p_13">             It is also made clear that the petitioner will be liable to pay the rents or

occupation charges in respect of all the properties at the enhanced rates with effect from
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                               3</span>


August, 2015, again without prejudice to the rights and contentions of the parties in

such regard.
</p>
<p id="p_14">               There will be no order as to costs.
</p>
<p id="p_15">               Urgent certified website copies of this order, if applied for, be supplied to

the parties subject to compliance with all requisite formalities.
