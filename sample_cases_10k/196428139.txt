     THIS WRIT PETITION IS FILED UNDER <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1">ARTICLE 226</a>

     THIS PETITION COMING ON FOR PRELIMINARY
HEARING, THIS DAY, NAGARATHNA J., MADE THE
FOLLOWING:
                            -: 3 :-


                       ORDER
</pre><p id="p_1">NAGARATHNA J.,
    Sri R.G.Kolle, learned AGA accepts notice on behalf

of Respondent Nos.1 and 3. Sri Gururaj Joshi, learned

Advocate accepts notice for Respondent No.2 and Sri

N.Krishnananda Gupta, learned Advocate accepts notice

for Respondent Nos.4 and 5.
</p>

<p id="p_2">      2.   In this writ petition, the petitioner has assailed

the closure notice dated 27/08/2012, issued by respondent

No.2 [Annexure "A"].       A direction is also sought to

respondent No.3 to consider the application vide Annexure

"C" dated 19/10/2012 and to permit the petitioner to

operate its stone crushing unit pending consideration of its

application.
</p>

<p id="p_3">      3. We have heard the learned counsel on both sides.
</p>
<p id="p_4">They state in unison that this writ petition could be

disposed of in terms of the orders dated 21/11/2012

passed     in   W.P.No.41069/2012     and   W.P.Nos.41515-
</p>
<p id="p_5">528/2012.       The submission of the learned counsel is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                          -: 4 :-</span>


placed on record.   The order dated 21/11/2012 reads as

under:-
</p>
<p id="p_6">           "In   the   present   case,    by    Gazette
     Notification dated 14.8.2012 safer zones in
     Haveri had been duly notified to the public.
     Section 3 (3) of the Karnataka Regulation of
     Stones Crushers Act, 2011 (for short 'the Act')
     permits a period of three months to existing
     Stone Crusher Units to trans locate themselves
     to safer zones.   In this regard an application
     has to be filed with the Licensing Authority
     within a reasonable time.       Unfortunately, the
     Act does not prescribe this period.         In the
     present case, the Petitioner applied to the
     Licensing Authority on 24.9.2012.         It is not
     disputed that consequent upon the Petitioner's
     application, the Licensing Authority till date has
     neither granted or refused the license under
     the provisions of the said Act.     Since Section
     3(4) of the Act prescribes an outer limit of six
     months for shifting from the date of grant, it
     could be inferred that the Application has to be
     made within three months of the requisite
     Gazetting of the safer zones.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                       -: 5 :-</span>


<p id="p_7">2.     In these circumstances, the Petition is
allowed by directing the Respondents to permit
the operation of the Petitioner at the present
site up to 23.12.2012 or till such time the
application is considered and disposed of, by
the Licensing Authority.
</p>

<p id="p_8">3.     Learned counsel for the Karnataka State
Pollution Control Board (for short 'the Board')
submits that the Petitioner did not apply for
the consent of the Board on the expiry of the
previous consent on 30.06.2012.           In normal
circumstances, the contention would be well
founded since no one is permitted to operate
without a current permission or consent.
</p>

<p id="p_9">4.     In the circumstances of the present case
however,    a   piquant    situation   has   arisen,
inasmuch as the Pollution Control Board cannot
grant permission to the Petitioner to operate in
its   present site,   since   it   must   statutorily
relocate to a safer zone as identified by the
State.   Needless to add that if and when the
petitioner is granted a license to relocate a
safer zone, conditions under Section 6 (9) of
the Act will have to be complied with as also
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                              -: 6 :-</span>


       the permission would have to be obtained from
       the Board.
</p>

<p id="p_10">       5.    With these observations, the Petition is
       allowed and Annexure-H dated 5.9.2012 is
       quashed."
</p>

<p id="p_11">       4. In the circumstances, the respondent - authorities

are    directed   to   consider   the   petitioner's   application

Annexure "C" dated 19/10/2012 in accordance with law, as

the safer zone for Bangalore Urban District is notified on

30/08/2012.       The petitioner is permitted to continue the

stone crushing unit in the present location till the disposal

of    his application. Accordingly, the impugned closure

notice dated 27/08/2012 (Annexure "A") is quashed. Writ

petition is allowed in the aforesaid terms.
