ORAL ORDER</pre>
 


 


 


<p id="p_1">1.	Heard
Mr. Harmish K. Shah, learned advocate for the petitioner and Mr. Y.V.
Vaghela, learned Central Government Standing Counsel for the
respondent.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_2">2.	By
way of this petition, the petitioner has prayed for restoration of
its name to the register of Companies maintained in the office of the
Registrar of Companies, Gujarat State, as provided under <a href="/doc/1155573/" id="a_1">Section
560(6)</a> of the Companies Act, 1956.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_3">3.	It
appears from the record of the petition that the Company  
 Shantidoot Cement and Chemicals Pvt. Ltd.  (hereinafter referred
to as  the Company ) came to be incorporated on 8.9.1995 under
the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_2">Companies Act</a>, 1956 and was given a certificate of incorporation
by the Registrar of Companies, Ahmedabad. It transpires from the
record that the Company had applied for prospecting licence/mining
lease for village Bhojebedi as well as village Laloi on 4.7.1995 and
9.10.1995 respectively. It further appears from the record that the
Company was formed to set up a cement plant of capacity of 600 tpd..
It also appears that the State Government granted PL to the Company
at Bhojabedi but rejected the PL application of the Company at
Village Laloi. It transpires from the record that the Company has
filed a Revision Application which was allowed and the case was
remanded back to the State Government to decide PL application of the
Company. However, the State Government has not taken any decision and
the said matter is still pending. It appears from the record of the
petition that the cost of project was proposed to be financed by the
promoters and their relatives. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_4">4.	It
is the case of the petitioner that the Registrar of Companies,
Gujarat State, Ahmedabad, without following due procedure as provided
under <a href="/doc/1733325/" id="a_3">Section 560</a> of the Companies Act, 1956, deleted and struck off
the name of the Company from the register of the Companies on
11.9.2007. It is averred in the petition that the Registrar of
Companies had not issued any notice to the Company and straightway
published a notification in the official gazette. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_5">5.	It
is declared before this Court that the Company has no Secured,
Unsecured or Statutory Creditors as on date. It is contended that if
the restoration of the Company to the register of Companies is
granted as prayed for, no person or body would suffer any prejudice. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_6">6.	Mr.
</p><p id="p_7">Harmish K. Shah, learned advocate for the petitioner has reiterated
the aforesaid facts, which are noted on the basis of the averments
made in the petition. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_8">7.	In
response to the notice issued by this Court, the respondent -
Registrar of Companies has filed affidavit on 27.2.2013 and stand of
the respondent is that the notice has been issued as provided under
<a href="/doc/1733325/" id="a_4">Section 560</a> of the Companies Act, 1956 and therefore, it is not true
that the order for striking off the name of the petitioner Company
from the register came to be passed without any notice. It is
contended that since 1995, the statutory returns including balance
sheet and other returns have not been filed before the respondent. It
is further contended that the respondent issued final notice as
provided under <a href="/doc/1942181/" id="a_5">Section 560(5)</a> of the Companies Act, 1956 and the same
was also published in the Official Gazette. The respondent, after
examining the petition filed by the petitioner Company, has expressed
in Paragraph No.10 of the affidavit, which reads as under.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_9"> 10.	The
respondent has however, no objection if this Hon'ble High Court
passes an appropriate order for restoring the name of the Company
under <a href="/doc/1155573/" id="a_6">Section 560(6)</a> of the Act subject to: 
</p>

</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_11">(b)
The publication of notice in two leading Newspapers circulating in
the District and Official Gazette of Government of India, in regard
to the restoration of the name of the Company on the Register
maintained in the office of the Respondent as per the draft approved
by the Respondent, at the cost of the petitioner.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_12">(c)
Such other order as may be deemed fit and proper by this Hon'ble
Court under the circumstances of the case. 
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_13">8.	Mr.
</p><p id="p_14">Y.V. Vaghela, learned Central Government Standing Counsel appearing
for the respondent has submitted that if the petitioner Company
undertakes and agrees to fulfill the conditions which are mentioned
in Paragraph No.10 of the affidavit, as quoted hereinabove, the
respondent has no objection, if the petition is allowed and the name
of the petitioner Company is ordered to be registered in the register
of Companies maintained in the office of the Registrar of Companies.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_15">9.	Mr.
</p><p id="p_16">Harmish K. Shah, learned advocate for the petitioner states that the
