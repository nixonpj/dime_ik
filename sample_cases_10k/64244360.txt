CORAM: HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE VIKASH JAIN
ORAL JUDGMENT
Date: 23-07-2018

                     Heard learned counsel for the petitioners and learned

   counsel for the respondents.
</p>
<p id="p_11">                     2.    The present writ petition has been filed for

   quashing of the part of the order dated 20.10.2011 (Annexure-5)

   passed by the Appellate Authority cum Electrical Inspector, Patna in

   Appeal No. 23/2010 whereby and whereunder he has set aside the
 Patna High Court CWJC No.6055 of 2013 dt.23-07-2018                               2




        charge of meter tampering.
</p>
<p id="p_12">                            3. Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that in

        C.W.J.C. No. 506 of 2012 preferred by the respondent no. 1, this Court

        by its order dated 02.02.2012 (Annexure-A) had set aside the part of

        the impugned appellate order dated 20.10.2011 passed in Appeal No.

        23/2010 (Annexure-5) with a direction to the Appellate Authority to

        examine the documents of the respondent no. 1 and pass appropriate

        order.    It is submitted that the matter is still pending before the

        Appellate Authority. It is pointed out that in the part of the order of the

        Appellate Authority under challenge in the present writ petition, the

        Appellate Authority has written a finding that since the seal on the

        meter was not kept intact, it was not possible to carry out further

        testing of the meter itself. It is submitted that such finding of fact is

        ex facie contrary to the materials on record and as such this part of the

        impugned order is also liable to be set aside for fresh decision. It is

        stated that the meter in question had been removed under sealed and

        is lying in police custody in connection with the FIR in Budha Colony

        P.S. Case No. 138/2010 (Annexure-2). It is therefore submitted that

        contrary to the finding of the Appellate Authority, it is very much

        possible to have the meter re-tested.
</p>
<p id="p_13">                            4. Learned counsel for the respondent no. 1 appears

        and has been heard. He is unable to controvert the contention of the
 Patna High Court CWJC No.6055 of 2013 dt.23-07-2018                                3




        petitioner that the meter had in fact been removed under sealed and is

        kept in police custody. He has further no objection if the said meter is

        sent for re-testing before an appropriate laboratory.

</p><p id="p_14">                            5. Having heard the parties, this Court prima facie

        finds materials on record to show that the meter had been removed

        from the petitioner's premises under sealed. This is evident from the

        inspection/seizure report dated 11.08.2010 itself (Annexure-1), VIII

        discloses that the meter was seized in course of inspection/search, as

        well as the written report in the aforesaid Budha Colony P.S. Case

        No. 138/2010 which clearly states that the meter was removed,

        wrapped in marked cloth, stitched and paper sealed before seizure.

</p><p id="p_15">                            6. In the above view of the matter, the finding of the

        Appellate Authority that the meter was not kept properly sealed and is

        not amenable to further testing is hereby quashed. The petitioner shall

        be at liberty to approach the police authorities for taking delivery of

        the subject meter for the purpose of re-testing after following due

        procedure and formalities. The respondent no. 1 shall also be at liberty

        to request the petitioner within a week from the date of

        receipt/production of a copy of this judgment for testing of the meter

        at any reputed Lab of its choice.
</p>
<p id="p_16">                            7. The result of such testing shall be placed before the

        Appellate Authority to be taken into consideration before final disposal
          Patna High Court CWJC No.6055 of 2013 dt.23-07-2018                               4




                 of the Appeal pursuant to the order of this Court in C.W.J.C. No. 506 of

                 2012.
</p>
<p id="p_17">                                     8. The writ petition stands allowed.
