 of defendant no.3 and member of vehicle Depot Karamchari Union and had represented
the said union as President for several years but later on no election was conducted after
the year 2007 and the defendant no.1 declared itself as office bearer of executive
committee of the union and deleted the name of plaintiff from member list and therefore
their claim be declared as void and the defendant no.1 be directed to enroll the plaintiff
and conduct the election with appointment of election commissioner by the defendant
no.2 and 3.
</p>

<p id="p_2">2.           The suit was contested by defendant no1 and 3 by filing WS but defendant no.2
did not contest the case.
</p>

<p id="p_3">3.           Ld. predecessor having framed framed five issues allowed the plaintiff to lead
evidence wherein the plaintiff examined himself as PW1 whereafter defendants were
allowed to lead evidence in which Rajender Singh was examined as DW-1 but since he
could not him produce himself for further cross-examination, his evidence was closed.
One other witness i.e. Captain Sukhbir Bawja was examined as DW-3 but witness
Jagmal was not produced for evidence despite filing of affidavit. In sum and substance,
it can be said that only one witness was examined from the defendant's side.
</p>

<p id="p_4">4.           Subsequently the plaintiff himself started absconding showing a clear indication
of no interest. However, since in the present matter defendant evidence was closed by
Ld. predecessor and arguments were also heard by Ld. predecessor on behalf of
defendant, the case could not have been dismissed in default. I therefore heard the
counsel for appearing defendant no.3 who through an application U/S 151 CPC brought
on record the document of the employer of plaintiff i.e. defendant no.3 and disclosed that
the plaintiff has retired from the services and submitted that the suit has become
infructous.
</p>

<p id="p_5">5.           I have considered the submissions and gone through the record. There is no
reason to disbelieve the application of defendant no.3 about retirement of plaintiff from
its service more so when the plaintiff has himself stopped appearing in the present case.
In such circumstances the prayers having become infructous due to the retirement of
plaintiff from the service which consequently dis entitles him from availing membership
of Karamchari Union, I am of the view that the discussion on the proposed issues will
