<p id="p_4">      These three appeals have been preferred by the appellants Gopali, Brij

Kishor alias Bijju and Khusi Ram against the judgement and order passed by

Additional Session Judge, Court No. 6, Sitapur dated 06.02.2010 whereby

convicting and sentencing them with respect to the offence said to have been

committed by them under <a href="/doc/764237/" id="a_1">Sections 394</a>, <a href="/doc/455468/" id="a_2">307</a>, <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_3">302</a> &amp; <a href="/doc/812083/" id="a_4">411</a> IPC P.S. Khairabad,

district Sitapur Session Trial Nos. 1208 of 2004, 1210 of 2004 and 1211 of

2004. Appellant Khusi Ram has been convicted and sentenced also under

<a href="/doc/1961417/" id="a_5">Section 25</a> (1-B) Arms Act, in Session Trial No. 1209 of 2004 P.S. Khairabad,

district Sitapur. The appellants have been sentenced for maximum term of life

imprisonment with fine stipulation.
</p>
<p id="p_5">      It is a case of the prosecution that the accused persons-appellants were

not known to the complainant. They were seen in the Torch light and Truck

light while they were fleeing away after looting the Truck from the seen of

occurrence. No identification proceedings were conducted for identifying the

accused persons. Only they were identified in the court.

</p><p id="p_6">      It has been argued by the learned counsel for the appellants that it is a

case where the conviction is based upon no evidence for the reasons :

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">      (A) The accused persons were not named in the FIR nor they were got

           identified after their arrest, by the witnesses.

      (B) There is no evidence of prosecution witnesses to the effect that the

          appellants had committed the aforesaid crime.

      (C) There is no recovery from the appellants so as to rope them in the

          aforesaid crime.</blockquote><p id="p_7">

</p><p id="p_8">      It has further been argued that the appellants were on bail during the

course of trial and they did not misuse the liberty of bail granted to them.

</p><p id="p_9">      Taking into consideration over all aspect of the matter and in view of

the submissions made by the learned counsel for the appellants and also

considering that appeal will take considerable long time in reaching its

justifiable conclusion, without going further into merit of the case, we find it

Khusi Ram convicts of aforesaid sessions trial numbers, be released on bail

on their furnishing a personal bond and two sureties (each of them), in the

</p><p id="p_11">       Realization of half of the fine is stayed and remaining half of the fine

shall be deposited by the appellants within one month from the date of their
