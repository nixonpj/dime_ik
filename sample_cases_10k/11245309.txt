who requested the plaintiff for accommodation of a room in the

contravention to his earlier statement. Witness also denied the

suggestion that he paid rent to the plaintiff. It is further denied that the

plaintiff has sent a Legal Notice to him. It is further denied that any

complaint is made by the plaintiff against him. He also denied the

suggestion that he was not residing in the premises in dispute or that he

is in occupation of the property in dispute illegally. He further denied that

he was in occupation of the premises as a licensee.



7.2         Defendant admitted in his cross-examination that he has

never sent a legal notice to the plaintiff regarding issue of rent receipt.

his evidence by way of affidavit Ex. DW-2. During the course of cross-

upon the plaintiff. However, it is contended on behalf of the ld

10.1 The onus to prove the issue was cast upon the plaintiff. It is

the case of the plaintiff that she had allowed the defendant to use

the suit premises as a licensee for three months on the request of

the defendant Sh. Bhup Singh, who is a pujari in a near by temple

for three months in January 2001. Defendant failed to vacate the

premises after three months and resorted to one after another

pretext to avoid the vacation of the suit premises.



10.2        PW 7 Smt. Ramewshwari Devi served a legal notice dt.

06.05.2002 through registered AD / UPC and the defendant was

asked to vacate the premises and also terminating the license of

06.05.2002. He also proved Ex. PW 1/8 and Ex. PW 1/9 the

registered postal and UPC receipt of the notice. Moreover, it is a

matter of record that the above stated legal notice was replied vide

a notice dt. 20.05.2002 through the advocate of defendant and the

defendant assert himself as a tenant in respect of the suit premises

in the reply to the notice.

10.3        In support of his case plaintiff examine HC Sh.

Narender No. 134 PHQ, Delhi as PW 4. He was brought into the

police authorities which is exhibited as PW 4/1. The witness was

never cross examined by the defendant despite opportunity.

 10.4       Similarly, PW - 5 Sh. Ranbir Singh, Mauza clerk,

Record Room ( Civil ), Tis Hazari Courts, Delhi was produced to

prove record of an earlier case fixed by defendant against plaintiff.

Copies of the same were duly exhibited as Ex. PW 5/A and Ex.

PW 5/B, where the court made an observation of the non payment

of any rent by the defendant even in the court also and the above

stated case was eventually dismissed by the court.



10.5       Whereas the defendant completely failed to rebut any

of the above said testimony the witnesses. Sh. Bhup Singh

produced by defendant is not trustworthy witness. It is the own

admission of the defendant that he do not know Sh. Bhup Singh

and on the other hand, Sh. Bhup Singh come to depose on the

behest of defendant. It has been claim that Sh. Bhup Singh and

plaintiff have colluded in order to oust defendant. However, the fact

that defendant produced him as his witness, suggest otherwise

and a presumption can be drawn that on the advice of Sh. Bhup

license basis to the defendant



10.6        Not a single document has been bring forth by the

defendant to prove the existence of his tenancy. No witness has

been brought who saw him paying the rent to defendant no. 7 nor

any any rent receipt or deed is on record to prove the averment.

And it is apparent that the averment made by the defendant is a

bald averment and has been made to take advantage of the <a href="/doc/679372/" id="a_5">Delhi

Rent Control Act</a>.

10.7        All this facts lead to one conclusion that defendant was

never a tenant in respect of the suit premises but initially inducted

as a licensee in the same and after the termination of the licensee

by the plaintiff vide the legal notice Ex. PW 1/7, he was nothing but

an illegal occupant on the property of the plaintiff.

           etc. from January 2001 to June 2002?OPP

11.1       To prove the question of damage / mesne profit the

plaintiff examined PW 2 Sh. Nemi Chand who claimed to live as a

tenant in the suit premises for 4 to 5 years and admitted to have

paid rent @ 1500/- per month excluding water and electricity

charges @ 800/- per month. However, during cross examination, it

was revealed that plaintiff is his mother in law, but no other

suggestion to test the veracity of the statement was given to the

witness he also produced the certificate of her daughter to

established that he used to reside in the said suit premises but

never the less no other document was bring forth, by the witness.

Court in case titled as " Hardev Singh Sidhu Vs. Harjasjit Singh

CS-524/10
SMT. RAMESHWARI DEVI VS SH. BHARAT LAL SHARMA             Page No. 24/28
             Under the provision of East Punjab Union Rent

Restriction Act, 1949, Secton 30 (2) (i) the rent of the premises

was contended to be Rs. 1400/- per month, whereas, contention of

the tenant was that rent of Rs. 600/- per month. The finding on

record established that the earlier tenant was paying Rs. 1300/-

per month. It clearly shows that there is no occasion to let the

property of the petition to rs. 600/-. The concurrent of the fact must

be approved. The contention of the tenant not believable since

there was no occasion for landlord to let the premises at a lower

rate of rent.
</p>
<p id="p_36">

11.2        However there is nothing on record to disbelief the

testimony of the PW 2 only because he is related to the plaintiff.

From the deliberation in the previous issue and the judicial

precedent cited, it is apparent that there is no occasion for the

plaintiff to let out the suit property at the rate of Rs. 300/- as

claimed by the defendant when the same was earlier let out at the

rate of rs. 1500/- per month excluding water and electricity charge.

CS-524/10
SMT. RAMESHWARI DEVI VS SH. BHARAT LAL SHARMA                Page No. 25/28
 It further substantiate the claim of the plaintiff that she has given

the premises to the defendant on the basis of license for a period

of three months. It is also established law of land that the license

exit at the pleasure of licensee and once it is revoked the licensee

is left with no rights to hold the premises. It is established that

defendant is an illegal occupant in the suit premises is liable to

pay the mesne profit and user charges towards the suit premises

and amenities enjoyed therein. Plaintiff can be given some benefit

of the judicial precedent in the present facts and circumstances of

the case.

<p id="p_37">

11.3        Keeping in view the principal of equity and law I am of

the view that plaintiff is entitled for the damages / mesne profit not

only for the preiod of one month but for the entire period during

which the defendant remained in possession of the suit premises

without paying damages and mesne profit. The vicinity and the

locality of the suit premises as per the contention of the plaintiff, he

would have fetched Rs. 3000/- - Rs. 3,500/- easily as rent now a
