       LABOUR COURT NO. IX, KARKARDOOMA COURTS, DELHI.


ID NO.  51/11

Unique Case ID No. 02402COO11572011

BETWEEN THE WORKMAN

Sh. Om Prakash S/o Sh. Jitan Dass as represented by All India General Mazdoor 
Trade Union, 170, Bal Mukund Khand, Giri Nagar, Kalkaji, New Delhi­19.
AND THE MANAGEMENT OF
M/s Jay Dee Exports, A­35, G.T. Karnal Road, Industrial Area, Delhi­33.

               Date of Institution               : 04.01.2011
               Date on which award reserved      : 03.02.2012

                                     A W A R D

1       Vide this award, I shall disposed off the reference as referred by Dy. Labour 

Commissioner, Distt. North­West,  Govt. of the National Capital Territory of 

Delhi arising   between the parties named above to this labour court vide 

notification   No.   F.   24/ID/(257)/10/NWD/Lab./360/10/2851­55   dated 

30.11.2010</pre><p id="p_1"> with the following  terms of reference:­

        "Whether services of Sh. Om Prakash s/o Sh. Jitan Dass have been 

terminated illegally and/or unjustifiably by the management  and if yes, to 

what relief is he entitled and what directions are necessary in this respect?"

2       The claimant has filed his statement of claim stating therein that he was 

working  with  the  management since April 2008  as a tailor  and his  last drawn 

wages were Rs. 4377/­ per month and he had never given any chance of complaint 

to the management. The management has not been provided legal facilities like 

leave book, over time, transport allowance, wages enhancement and bonus etc. and 

ID NO. 51/11                                                                       1/5
 when the workman demanded for such legal facilities from the management, the 

management   got   annoyed   and   ultimately     the   management   has   terminated   the 

services of the workman w.e.f. 28.03.2010 in violation of section 25F of Industrial 

Dispute Act, 1947 without any reason and without providing his earned wages. 

The workman thereafter sent a demand notice dated 23.04.2010 but despite having 

received the said demand notice, the management neither replied nor complied 

with the same and then the workman filed a written complaint before the Regional 

Assistant Labour Commissioner, Delhi Government, where the management was 

served   but   the   management   did   not   reinstate   the   workman   and   ultimately   the 

reference was made by the Delhi Government before this court and as such the 

workman has filed the present statement of claim before this court and has prayed 

that the management be directed to reimburse all the dues amount of his salary, 

bonus and other allowances alongwith back wages and the management be also 

directed to reinstate the workman with full back wages.
</p>
<p id="p_2">3       Management has filed the written statement taking preliminary objections 

that the workman has not come to the court with clean hands and has suppressed 

the material facts from the court and the workman has never been on the rolls of 

the management and there is no employer­employee relationship in between them 

and as such the workman has no locus standi to file the present claim. On merits, 

facts are denied that the workman had ever worked with the management and it is 

reiterated that the workman has never been in the employment of the management 

and as such it is prayed that the claim of the workman be dismissed. 

4       After   completion   of   pleadings,   following   issues   were   framed   on 

21.11.2011:
</p>
<p id="p_3">1       Whether   the   claimant   had   been   working   with   the   management 

regularly since April 2008 at the post of 'Tailor' drawing wages @ Rs.4377/­ 

per month?
</p>
<pre id="pre_2">ID NO. 51/11                                                                                 2/5
 2       Whether there was employer and employee relationship in between the 

parties herein?

3       Whether the services of the workman have been terminated illegally 

and/or unjustifiably by the management?

4       Relief.

5       After framing up of the issues, parties were given opportunity to lead their 

</pre><p id="p_4">respective evidence to support their contentions/pleas. Accordingly, workman has 

examined himself as WW1, on which date the management did not appear and has 

not   cross   examined   the   workman.   Opportunity   thereafter   was   granted   to   the 

workman to lead its evidence but nobody appeared from the management side on 

13.12.2011 and 20.12.2011 and ultimately the evidence of the management was 

closed   vide   order   dated   16.01.12   and   thereafter   the   matter   was   fixed   for   final 

arguments.
</p>
<pre id="pre_3">6       I have heard the arguments and perused the record.

7       My issuewise finding is as follows:

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">ISSUE NO. 1</span>

8       The onus of this issue was upon the workman and he had to prove that he 

</pre><p id="p_5">had been working with the management regularly since April 2008 at the post of 

'Tailor' drawing wages @ Rs.4377/­ per month.
</p>
<p id="p_6">        To prove this fact the workman has filed his evidence by way of affidavit 

thereby   deposing   in   terms   of   the   claim   that   he   had   been   working   with   the 

management as a tailor and his last drawn wages was Rs. 4377/­ per month. There 

is   no   cross   examination   on   this   point   by   the   management.   Although   the 

management has taken the objection in the written statement that the workman has 

never worked with the management but thereafter the management has not turned 

up.   Evidence   of   the   workman   has   remained   unrebutted.   Although   there   is   no 


ID NO. 51/11                                                                                       3/5
 documentary   evidence   on   record   but   oral   evidence   of   the   workman   has   gone 

unrebutted and unchallenged and as such issue is decided accordingly in favour of 

the workman and against the management by holding that the workman had been 

working with the management regularly since April 2008 at the post of 'Tailor' 

drawing wages @ Rs.4377/­ per month.
</p>
<p id="p_7"><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">ISSUE NO. 2</span>

9       The onus of this issue was upon both the parties and they had to prove that 

whether there was employer and employee relationship in between the parties. The 

workman   was   initially   supposed   to   prove   that   he   was   working   with   the 

management   and   the   management   was   under   the   obligation   to   prove   that   the 

workman had not been working with the management and he was never on the 

rolls of the management. The workman initially has led his evidence and while 

disposing off the issue no. 1 it has been held by the court that the workman has 

been able to prove that he was employed with the management. After discharging 

this onus by the workman, the onus had shifted upon the management and now the 

management was supposed to prove the facts as stated by the management in the 

written   statement.   The   management   neither   cross   examined   the   workman   nor 

examined any witness in its support. Mere denial of a fact by the management and 

then not proving it by leading positive evidence does not suffice the purpose of 

taking the defence by the management. Since there is no evidence on the party of 

the management and there is no rebuttal of the cross examination of the workman 

by the management, the court is of the considered opinion that the management 

has failed to prove the facts as stated by it in the written statement. Accordingly, it 

is hold that there was employer­employee relationship in between the parties.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">ISSUE NO. 3</span>

10      The onus of this issue was upon the workman and he had to prove that his 

services have been terminated illegally and/or unjustifiably by the management.

</p><p id="p_8">ID NO. 51/11                                                                               4/5
           The workman has deposed clearly in his evidence that he sent a demand 

notice to the management initially which even intervened and the Labour Inspector 

had visited the office of the management but management did not reinstate the 

workman. The workman thereafter had issued a notice earlier on 28.03.2010 and 

ultimately he has filed the present claim in terms of the reference of the Delhi 

Government. The reference dated 23.04.2010 through  Regional Assistant Labour 

Commissioner,   Delhi   Government   is   Ex.WW1/1,   statement   of   claim   before 

Labour Commissioner is Ex.WW1/2, postal receipt is Ex.WW1/3, demand notice 

dated 23.04.2010 is Ex.WW1/4 and have been proved by the workman   in support 

of his version. Therefore, the evidence of the workman has remained unrebutted 

and unchallenged and there is no reason to disbelieve the evidence of the workman 

and therefore, issue is decided in favour of the workman by hold that his services 

have been terminated illegally and/or unjustifiably by the management.

RELIEF:
</p>
<p id="p_9">11      Keeping in view issuewise findings, the reference is answered to the effect 

that the management has terminated the services of the workman Sh. Om Prakash 

illegally and unjustifiably and as such the workman is entitled to full back wages 

with   the   orders   of   reinstatement.   The   management   accordingly   be   directed   to 

reinstate the workman and pay all the legal dues to the workman.

12      A   copy   of   this   Award   be   sent   to   the   Deputy   Labour   Commissioner, 

Government of NCT of Delhi of Disst/Area concerned for publication as per rules 

and judicial file be consigned to Record Room as per rules.
