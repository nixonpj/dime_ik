</p><p id="p_12">      9. POINT NO.1 :-          It is the specific case of the

prosecution that the accused have assaulted complainant and

tried to    committed robbery. As per the canon of criminal

jurisprudence of our nation, prosecution       has to bring home

alleged guilt of accused with production of cogent and

satisfactory evidence. Case of all the accused is a total denial of

the version of prosecution.
</p>
<p id="p_13">      10. PW. 1 the complainant has deposed that on 17.1.2018

when he was moving on the road near Nayandally Metro Station

Bridge 2 persons came from his behind and assaulted on his head

and as a result the mobile fell on the ground and when he bend to

take mobile they assaulted with knife on his left forearm and

tried to rob the mobile, but     at that time the traffic signal

changed and hence they fled away from the spot and hence he

intimated to his friend Harish and took treatment. He further

deposed that he cannot saw them as they assaulted from behind

and he has not given any statement to the police by identifying

the knife. He has not identified the accused before the court.

accused and the knife in the PS and gave statement as per Ex.P.

has put his signature to spot mahazar Ex.P.3 at P. S and no one

put their signature to Ex.P.3. He turned hostile to the case of

the prosecution. In the cross-examination by the PP he denied

that one Surya also put his signature to Ex.P.3 and he is deposing

falsely to help the accused.
</p>
<p id="p_16">      12. PW. 3 the PSI has deposed that on 22.1.2018 at about

8.35 pm when he was on patrolling duty received information

that about 5-6 persons are making preparation to commit dacoity

near Nayandahally junction and as such he rushed to spot and

secured CW. 4 and 5 and staff CW. 6 to 11 and caught hold them

and seized wooden club, machu, 2 knives, rod and chilli powder

pocket and Honda Dio No. KA-02-JG 2935 and Bajaj Pulsar No.

KA-01-EF-9212 and drawn the mahazar-Ex.P.5 and brought the

accused to the PS and produced before CW. 15 and gave repot.

He   identified the MO.1 to 6       and the accused before the

accused. In the cross-examination by the defense he admitted

that the alleged spot is a busiest spot and he denied that he is

deposing falsely and he created the case file for the purpose of

this case.
</p>
<p id="p_17">      13. PW. 4 the CMO of Victoria Hospital deposed that      on

17.1.2018 at about 10.00 pm he treated one Rajanna who came
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                6                SC No.1381/2018</span>


with the history of assault at Outer ring road, near Kalyani

Motors, Nayandahalli   and he found     that he sustained stab

wound 3X3 cm on left side stomach, 5X3 cm cut wound on left

fore arm and he send him to Operation theater. He further

deposed that he issued wound certificate-Ex.P.5 and he deposed

that the above said injuries may cause with the knife-MO.1. This

witness has not been cross examined by the defense.

</p><p id="p_18">      14. PW. 5    the PI has deposed that on 22.1.2018      he

received the accused, seized articles, complaint from PW. 3 and

registered the case in Cr. No. 37/2018 for the offence p/u/s.

399 and 402 of <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_10">IPC</a> and sent the FIR and inquired the accused

and subjected the seized articles to PF 7/18. In their statement

the accused have stated that they committed offence in Cr. No.

23/18. He further deposed that on 25.1.2018 he received case

file from CW. 12 and    secured the complainant and shown the

accused to the complainant and the complainant identified him

and hence he took body warrant and on 23.2.2018 received the

wound certified from Victoria Hospital and after completion of

investigation filed the charge sheet against the accused. He

identified the accused. He further deposed that CW. 12 has

received the complaint from the complainant of this case and

sent the FIR and then recorded the statement of the

complainant. In the cross-examination by the defense he denied

the suggestion that that PW. 3 has not produced any accused or

articles before him and he has not received any wound
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                 7                 SC No.1381/2018</span>


certificate and he registered false case against the accused. He

further denied that he is deposing falsely against the accused.

</p><p id="p_19">      15. On perusal of the above evidence, it transpires that

the prosecution has failed to secure CW. 3 to 5 the spot/seizure

panchaas as they left the address. The examination of CW. 6 to

12 are given up. The prosecution has examined only the

complainant and his friend, the CMO and 2 Police Officers. PW.

3 and 5 have deposed regarding the caught hold of the accused

and registration of case in another crime for the offence p/u/s

399and 402 of <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_11">IPC</a>. PW. 4 the CMO has deposed regarding the

injuries sustained by the complainant in the incident. As per the

version of the complainant the accused assaulted him with knife

while trying to snatch the mobile. The said knife is recovered.

But the complainant has not identified the accused and the knife

before the court. He turned hostile to the case of the

prosecution. Here no independent witnesses are examined to

prove the alleged recovery of knife. So it can be said that the

prosecution failed to bring home the alleged guilt of the accused

by producing cogent and satisfactory evidence. In the absence

of cogent and convincing evidence from the prosecution side,

the accused cannot be convicted.      Thus it can be said that

absolutely there is no evidence to prove the alleged incident and

the recoveries. Thus it can be said that prosecution utterly

failed to prove the charges leveled against the accused. The

basic principles of criminal justice system are that, accused
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                 8                 SC No.1381/2018</span>


should be treated innocent until the guilt is proved beyond all

reasonable doubts and benefit of       doubts, if any, should be

extended to the accused.    In the light of these principles, this

Court safely hold that, the prosecution has failed to   establish

the charges leveled      against the accused No.1 and 2 and

reasonable doubts are araised about the allegation made against

the accused. Hence, benefit of doubt is extended to the

accused No.1 and 2 as they deserve for it. Therefore, available

materials are not cogent and satisfactory to hold accused No.1

and 2    guilty for the offences punishable U/Sec.398<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_12"> of Indian

Penal Code</a>.    Thus the prosecution failed to prove point no.1

beyond all reasonable doubts as required under law. Hence point

no.1 is answered in the negative.
</p>
<p id="p_20">        16. POINT NO.2:- In the light of findings on above point

accused are to be acquitted for the offences U/Sec.398<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_13"> of

Indian Penal Code</a>. Accordingly, this court proceeds to pass the
