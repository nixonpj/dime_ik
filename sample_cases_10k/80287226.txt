<p id="p_1">                     BRIEF FACTS AND REASONS FOR DECISION



</p><p id="p_2">1.         Vide this judgment, I shall dispose off, the above captioned case FIR No. 

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">State Vs. Satendra @ Baba, FIR No. 340/10, PS Gokalpuri                                                        Page 1 of 5</span>

    340/2010. A charge U/s 25/54/59 of <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_3">Arms Act</a> was framed against accused 

    namely Satendra @ Baba on 21.02.11, with the allegations that on 28.11.2010, 

    at about 07.00 PM, at Gokal Puri Pulia, Delhi, within the jurisdiction of P.S. 

    Gokalpuri, accused was found in possession of one Country made Pistol with 

    five   live   cartridges   without   any   licence   or   permit,   in   contravention   of 

    notification issued by Delhi Administration. The accused pleaded not guilty 

    and claimed trial.
</p>
<p id="p_3">

</p><p id="p_4">2.         The prosecution has examined seven witnesses to bring home the guilt 

    against the accused. Thereafter, PE was closed.  Statement of accused recorded 

    U/s. 313 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_4">Cr.P.C</a>. The accused did not examine any witness in support of his 

    defence.
</p>
<p id="p_5">

</p><p id="p_6">3.         Final arguments have been heard from both the side. Record has been 

    carefully perused. The prosecution has examined DO/HC Ram Singh as PW­1, 

    Ct. Parmod Kumar examined as PW­2,  HC Naresh Kumar examined as PW­3, 

    Ct. Lalit Kumar examined as PW­4, Ct. Vipul Kumar examined as PW­5, First 

    IO/ASI Krishan Kumar examined as PW­6 and Second IO/SI Deepak Kumar 

    examined as PW­7.  
</p>
<p id="p_7">4.         As per the prosecution case, on the relevant date i.e. 28.11.2010, PW­2 

    ( Parmod Kumar) PW­4 (Ct. Lalit kumar) and PW­6 (ASI Krishan Kumar) 

    were on patrolling duty in the area of Gokalpuri. At about 06.30 PM, when 

    they   reached   at   Sanjay   Colony,   a   secret   informer   informed   them   that   one 

    notorious criminal of the area roaming around at the Pulia and he may have an 

    illegal weapon and the said police officials immediately rushed to Ganda Nala, 

    Gokal Puri. Thereafter, PW­6 without waisting time prepared the raiding party 

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">State Vs. Satendra @ Baba, FIR No. 340/10, PS Gokalpuri                                                        Page 2 of 5</span>
                                                           ­:3:­

    consisting   himself,   other   two  police   officials   and   secret   informer  and   they 

    reached the Pulia and saw one person who started running after seeing them. 

    Thereafter,   they   chased   him   and   apprehended.   On   his   formal   search,   one 

    Country made pistol (katta) with four live cartridges, were recovered from the 

    left side pocket of his pant and on pushing barrel catch, barrel opens and one 

    more live cartridge was also found inside the barrel. PW­6 (Krishan Kumar) 

    wrapped  the  said  CMP  and  cartridges   in   a white   cloth   and  converted  into 

    pulanda and the said pulanda was sealed with the seal of KK. Thereafter, PW­6 

    prepared   tehrir   and   the   same   is   handed   over   to   Ct.   Lalit   (PW­4)   for   the 

    registration of FIR.   After registration of the FIR, PW­4 reached at the spot 

    alongwith PW­7 (SI Deepak Kumar) and copy of FIR &amp; original rukka/tehrir. 

    PW­6 (ASI Krishan Kumar) handed over the accused as well as case property 

    to PW­7 (SI Deepak Kumar).      
</p>
<p id="p_8">

</p><p id="p_9">5.         It is pertinent to mention here that as per the statement of PW­2, PW­4 as 

    well  as   PW­6,  no  independent   witness   from   the  public  were  joined   in   the 

    investigation.  Moreover, PW­6, who had conducted the search of the accused, 

    had   not   offered   his   personal   search   to   the   accused   before   conducting   the 

    search.   No   reason   whatsoever   has   been   put   forth   for   the   non­joining   of 

    independent witnesses. 
</p>
<p id="p_10">

</p><p id="p_11">6.         The explanation given by the prosecution in this regard is that the public 

    persons had refused to join the investigation.   It is argued on behalf of the 

    prosecution that PW­6 is very relevant witness being the recovery witness and 

    their testimony should not be ignored.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">State Vs. Satendra @ Baba, FIR No. 340/10, PS Gokalpuri                                                        Page 3 of 5</span>
</p><p id="p_13">                                                           ­:4:­

</p><p id="p_14">7.         The Sec. 100 of <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_5">Cr.P.C</a>.   mandates that while conducting search under 

    chapter   VII,   two   or   more   independent   and   respectable   inhabitants   of   the 

    locality (in which the place to be search is situated or of any other locality, if 

    no such inhabitants of the said locality is available or is willing to be a witness 

    to   the   search),   shall   be   called   upon   to   attend   and   witnesses   the   search. 

    Furthermore, the officers conducting search may issue an order in writing in 

    this regard.
</p>
<p id="p_15">           It is a settled proposition of law that Sub­<a href="/doc/1555874/" id="a_6">section 4</a> to Sec. 100 of <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_7">Cr.P.C</a>. 

    is   a   directory   provision   however,   the   explanation   of   non­joining   of 

    independent witness should also be plausible.  In nearly each and every case, a 

    general explanation  is  given that no public witness volunteered to join the 

    search/investigation   and   it   appears   that   even   the   "directory"   provision   has 

    been made nugatory. Such a vital provision cannot be made a dead letter in the 

    statute book as it is intended to curb any false recovery.



</p><p id="p_16">8.         The   explanation   put   forth   by   the   prosecution   for   non­joining   of 

    independent witness appears to be implausible for the reasons that there was 

    sufficient time with PW­2, PW­4 &amp; PW­6 to at least note down the names of 

    the persons who had refused to join the investigation.  No notice whatsoever, 

    was given to the persons refusing to join the investigation.  No reason for not 

    doing so, whatsoever has been put forth. This  creates a doubt on the very 

    recovery   of   a   country   made   loaded   pistol   alongwith   cartridges   from   the 

    possession of the accused.
</p>
<p id="p_17">

</p><p id="p_18">9.         It is also worth mentioning that as per the case of the prosecution  PW­2, 

    PW­4 and PW­6 were on patrolling duty at the time of incident. However, no

    DD entry in support of this fact has been placed on record. This further raises 

    doubts about the prosecution story.
</p>
<p id="p_19">

</p><p id="p_20">10.        In view of the foregoing reasons, I hold that the prosecution has failed to 

    prove the charge against the accused, beyond reasonable doubt. The benefit of 

    any lacunae, left in the investigation, has to be given to the accused.  For the 

    foregoing   reasons,   accused   is   entitled   to   acquittal.   Accused   is   therefore 

    acquitted.
