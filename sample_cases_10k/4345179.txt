                 the averments made in supplementary affidavit filed today

                 relevant portion whereof reads as follows:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">                               "1. That the petitioner is Resident of Village- Raghauli,
                               P.S. Bisfi, District, Madhubani and the present case has
                               been instituted in Bochhaha P.S. in the District of
                               Muzaffarpur, which is a far distance of about 50-60 KM
                               from the village of the petitioner.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">                               2.     That it is relevant to state here that the First
                               Information Report has lodged on 19.4.2008 against four
                               unknown persons, who have ridded on two motor cycle
                               and since the date of First Information Report to 2nd week
                               of February 2015 neither Bochhaha Police station nor
                               Bisphi ever came at the residential house of the petitoiner
                               in search of the petitioner. For the 1st time in the 3rd week
                               of February 2015, Bisphi Police came at the house of
                               petitioner in his absence in search of the petitioner. The
                               petitioner after coming to know about the same enquired
                               into the matter. He came to know in connection with the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1"> Patna High Court Cr.Misc. No.18640 of 2015 (2) dt.15-06-2015                          2</span>




                            present case, police came in search of the petitioner.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">                            3.   That thereafter the petitioner approached with the
                            advocate at Muzaffarpur and obtained the certified copy
                            of First Information Report and filed anticipatory bail
                            before the Ld. Sessions Judge, Muzaffarpur on 23.02.15,
                            who vide his order dated 27.02.15 passed in ABP no-
                            357/2015 "Sushil Thakur Vs. The State of Bihar" was
                            pleased to reject the prayer of the petitioner."</blockquote><p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">                            Having regard to the nature of allegation against the

             petitioner for offence under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_1">Section 302</a>/<a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_2">34</a> of the Indian Penal

             Code and <a href="/doc/244673/" id="a_3">Section 27</a> of the Arms Act, this Court, keeping in view

             that the First Information Report was lodged against the unknown

             persons and that the involvement of the petitioner has surfaced on

             the confessional statement of the co-accused and also other co-

             accused, namely, Akhilesh Kumar and Arun Kumar Singh having

             similar allegations have been granted bail by this Court on

             10.2.2008 and 6.1.2011 respectively vide Annexure 4 &amp; 4/1 to the

             supplementary affidavit, is inclined to grant privilege of

             anticipatory bail to the petitioner only if it is found that the

             petitioner was never sought to be arrested by the police in the

             interregnum period of seven years prior to 3rd week of February,

             2015..
</p>
<p id="p_4">                           In that view of the matter, this Court would direct the

             petitioner to surrender before the court below within a period of

             four weeks from today, whereafter, the court below shall look into
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2"> Patna High Court Cr.Misc. No.18640 of 2015 (2) dt.15-06-2015                         3</span>




             the case diary as also the relevant records of the court to find out

             as to whether the petitioner was evading his arrest and as to

             whether the version of the petitioner in the supplementary affidavit

             filed today that the police despite obtaining requisition from the

             court on 26.9.2008 had made effort to arrest the petitioner only in

             the third week of February, 2015 is correct?
</p>
<p id="p_5">                           If the court below on making such enquiry from the

             records would find that there is no documentary proof of

             absconding of petitioner and evading his arrest, it would release

             the petitioner, namely, Sushil Thakur @ Sushil Kumar Thakur

             shall be released on bail on furnishing bail bond of Rs. 10,000/-

             (ten thousand) with two sureties of the like amount each to the

             satisfaction of Judicial Magistrate, 1st, Muzaffarpur in connection

             with Bochaha P.S. Case No. 53 of 2008, subject to the conditions

             as laid down under <a href="/doc/1692057/" id="a_4">Section 438(2)</a> of the Cr.P.C. as also subject to

             following conditions:-
</p>
<p id="p_6">
</p><p id="p_7">             (i)      That both the bailors will be a close relative of the

             petitioner, who will undertake an affidavit giving genealogy as to

             how they are related with the petitioner. The bailors will also

             undertake to inform the court if there is any change in the address

             of the petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_8">             (ii)     That the affidavit shall clearly state that the petitioner is not
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">           Patna High Court Cr.Misc. No.18640 of 2015 (2) dt.15-06-2015                      4</span>




                       an accused in any other case and if he is, he shall not be released

                       on bail.
</p>
<p id="p_9">                       (iii)    That the bailors shall also state on affidavit that they will

                       inform the court concerned, if the petitioner is implicated in any

                       other case of similar nature after his release in the present case and

                       thereafter the court below will be at liberty to initiate the

                       proceeding for cancellation of bail on the ground of misuse.

</p><p id="p_10">                       (iv)     That the petitioner will be well represented on each and

                       every date in course of trial and if he fails to do so on two

                       consecutive dates, his bail will be liable to be cancelled on this

                       ground alone.
</p>
<p id="p_11">                                      It is, however, once again reiterated that if there is

                       documentary evidence to establish that the petitioner was actually

                       absconding or evading his arrest for a period of seven years, he

                       shall be taken into custody, whereafter, he will be at liberty to

                       make a prayer for his regular bail.
