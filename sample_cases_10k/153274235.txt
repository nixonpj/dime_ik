JUDGMENT:
</pre>


<p id="p_1">1.      This is a simple suit for recovery of Rs. 73,000/­ alongwith interest. 

The important facts of the case, as averred in the plaint, are that the 

plaintiff is a partnership firm duly registered under <a href="/doc/107341/" id="a_1">Partnership Act</a> and 

Swami Kapoor is one of its registered partner and he is entitled to sign, 

verify and pursue the suit.  It is further mentioned that the defendant had 

been purchasing the goods from the plaintiff from time to time and had 

been making part payments on different dates.  Further, it is mentioned 

that   these   purchases   and   payments   were   regularly   entered   in   the 

plaintiff's account books.  Further, it is stated that after adjusting the part 

payment made by the defendant, Rs. 58,701.89/­, remained outstanding 

and   the   defendant   is   liable   to   pay   it   apart   from   interest   @   12   %   per 

annum.  It is also submitted that in this regard a notice dated 04.01.2001 

was   served   on   defendant   and   after   that   defendant   paid   a   sum   of 

Rs. 4,000/­ on 27.08.2001 leaving a balance of Rs. 54,701.89/­.  It is also 

mentioned   that   the   defendant   is   also   liable   to   pay   interest   of 

Rs.   18,298.11/­   and   in   total   a   sum   of   Rs.   73,000/­   is   due   against   the 

defendant.    In  view  of  this,  it is prayed  that a   decree   of Rs. 73,000/­ 

alongwith future interest and costs be passed in favour of plaintiff and 

against the defendant.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                             3</span>

</p><p id="p_3">2.      Summons was duly served upon the defendant.   The defendant 

contested   the   suit   by   filing   written   statement   whereby   preliminary 

objections were taken to the effect that the suit is not maintainable in the 

present form as it has been filed by company/firm against a company/firm 

without disclosing details of their proprietor/partner/director/manager.   It 

is   also   mentioned   that   the   suit   is   barred   by   limitation   as   the   last 

transaction between the parties was conducted in 1998 and the suit has 

been filed in the year 2002.  On merits, it is replied that the entry of cash 

payment   allegedly   received   by   plaintiff   on   27.08.2001   is   a   mere 

manipulation   as   the   defendant   had   always   paid   the   amount   through 

cheques.     It   is   also   denied   that   the   plaintiff   served   a   notice   dated 

04.01.2001.     Further,   it   is   mentioned   that   nothing   is   due   towards   the 

defendant.  In view of above, it is prayed that the suit of the plaintiff be 

dismissed with costs.
</p>
<p id="p_4">

</p><p id="p_5">3.      The plaintiff filed replication to the written statement wherein he 

denied the contentions raised by the defendant and reasserted the facts 

mentioned in the plaint.

<p id="p_6">

</p><p id="p_7">4.      On the basis of the pleading of the parties, following issues were 

framed by Ld. Predecessor of this court vide order dated 17.08.2005:

     ii. Whether the suit is barred by limitation of time? OPD

     iii. Whether   the   plaintiff   is   entitled   for   a   decree   of   recovery   of

witness   box   as   PW1   and   reiterated   the   facts   given   in   the   plaint   and 

further proved the following documents:­

</p><p id="p_17">6.       In his evidence, the defendant also produced one witness, namely, 

Sh. Suresh Khokha, proprietor of the defendant firm.   He appeared as

given below.
</p>
<p id="p_20">

Issue no. 1 :­ 

        Whether the suit is not maintainable in its present form?



</p><p id="p_21">8.      Burden   of   proof  of   this   issue   was   on   the   defendant.     It   was 

mentioned in the written statement that the suit is not maintainable in the 

present form as the details of the proprietor/partner/director/manager of 

plaintiff and defendant firm have not been disclosed.   But, it is evident 

that the defendant has disclosed in his evidence that he is the proprietor 

of   the   defendant   firm,   whereas,   the   plaintiff   has   proved   Form   "A"   Ex. 

PW1/1 related to registration of plaintiff partnership firm which reflects 

the names of all the partners. Moreover, the non­disclosing of name of 

partner is mere an irregularity and is not fatal for the maintainability of the 

suit of the plaintiff. Hence, this issue is decided in favour of the plaintiff 

and against the defendant.

Issue no. 2 :­

</pre><p id="p_23">         Whether the suit is barred by limitation of time?



</p><p id="p_24">9.      Burden of proof of this issue was also placed on the defendant. 

The defendant has claimed that the last transaction between the parties 

was   conducted   in   1998   whereas   the   suit   was   filed   in   2002.   It   is 

emphasized that he always made payments against the goods delivered 

by the plaintiff by way of cheques and this is clear from the Statement of 

Account of defendant (Annexure 'A') filed by the plaintiff.  Moreover, the 

plaintiff has also admitted that all but last payment dated 27.08.2001 have 

been made by defendant only by cheques. Ld. Counsel for defendant 

argued   that   entry   dated   27.08.2001,   qua   receiving   of   cash   amount   of 

Rs. 4,000/­, in the Statement of Accounts is mere manipulation to bring 

the suit within limitation period. I find force in this submission since the 

plaintiff has not produced any material to show as to who had paid the 

cash amount, where it was paid and who received it. Further, it is difficult 

to accept how the defendant opted to pay such meager amount after a 

gap   of   about   3   years.   It   is   not   disputed   that   before   the   alleged   cash 

payment   of   Rs.   4,000/­,   last   transaction   between   the   parties   was 

conducted on  21.12.1998,  whereas, the  present suit has been  filed  on 

15.07.2002, i.e., after 3 years and 7 months approximately. In this regard, 

Page 6 of 10                                                             Suit no. 708/06/02
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                               7</span>

the   plaintiff   has   mentioned   that   he   had   sent   a   legal   notice   dated 

04.01.2001 Ex. PW1/21 to the defendant for demanding outstanding dues 

and after receiving of this notice, the defendant paid a sum of Rs. 4,000/­ 

in cash and therefore, the period of limitation would start from 27.08.2001 

when the last payment was made by the defendant and therefore, the 

suit is within the limitation period.
</p>
<p id="p_25">

</p><p id="p_26">10.       It is observed that the plaintiff has placed on record the receipt 

Ex.   PW1/20   issued   by   the   plaintiff   firm   mentioning   that   they   have 

received a sum of Rs. 4,000/­ in cash from defendant on 27.08.2001.  It is 

pleaded by defendant that this receipt does not bear his signatures  and 

this   fact   has   been   admitted   by   plaintiff   in   his   cross­examination.   It   is 

argued by Ld. Counsel for the plaintiff that since the defendant made part 

payment   on   account   on   27.08.2001,   the   period   of   limitation   would   be 

freshly computed from that date. However, I do not see any legal basis in 

this plea of the plaintiff side.    As per <a href="/doc/1375684/" id="a_3">Section 19</a> of the Limitation Act,  

1963, if the payment on account of a debt is made before the expiration  

of the prescribed period of limitation by the person liable to pay the debt  

or by his agent duly authorized in his behalf, a fresh period of limitation  

shall be computed from the time when the payment was made, however,  

an acknowledgment of the payment should appear in the handwriting of,  

Page 7 of 10                                                            Suit no. 708/06/02
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                              8</span>

or in a writing signed by, the person making the payment.  In the case in 

hand,   it   is   undisputed   that   the   said   payment   receipt   is   neither   in 

handwriting   of   the   defendant   nor   has   been   signed   by   him.   In   such 

circumstances, even if part payment made by defendant on 27.08.2001 is 

considered to be proved on record, the said payment would not give any 

fresh period of limitation to the plaintiff and the limitation for filing the suit 

would   be   computed   from   last   admitted   transaction,   i.e.,   21.12.1998. 

Since, the suit has been filed 3 years and 7 months approximately after 

that,   there   remains   no   doubt   that   present   suit   is   barred   by   limitation. 

Accordingly, this issue is decided in favour of the defendant and against 

the plaintiff.  
</p>
<p id="p_27">

Issue no. 3 :­

        Whether  the   plaintiff   is  entitled   for   a   decree   of  recovery  of   Rs.  

73,000/­ as prayed? 
</p>
<p id="p_28">

</p><p id="p_29">11.     Burden of proof of this issue  is upon the  plaintiff.   Plaintiff has 

claimed   that   after   adjusting   part   payment   made   by   the   defendant, 

balance   of   Rs.   58,701.89/­   alongwith   interest   of   Rs.   18,298.11/­   is 

outstanding against the defendant.   In support of his case, the plaintiff 

has placed on record the bills Ex. PW1/3 to PW1/19.   It is important to 

Page 8 of 10                                                           Suit no. 708/06/02
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                             9</span>

note down that all the bills except bills Ex. PW1/3, PW1/4 and PW1/8 are 

not   raised   in   the   name   of   defendant.   The   plaintiff   has   not   given 

explanation in this regard.  However, the defendant has made it clear in 

his cross­examination that all the bills except bills Ex. PW1/3, PW1/4 &amp; 

PW1/8 were raised in the name of Amarnath Chiranji Lal &amp; Co. and not in 

the name of defendant firm and he was also one of the partners of the 

firm Amarnath Chiranji Lal &amp; Co.   The plaintiff side has not brought on 

record   any   evidence   to   rebut   the   facts   disclosed   by   defendant   in   his 

cross­examination that these bills have been raised in regard to some 

other firm and has not furnished any explanation as to how he can claim 

the bill amount from defendant in regard to bills Ex. PW1/5 to PW1/7 and 

Ex. PW1/9 to PW1/19, which have not been raised in the name of the 

defendant firm. Thus, it appears that the plaintiff has merged the claims 

in respect of two different firms without any basis.  Moreover, the plaintiff 

has failed  to prove  on   record  any  Statement of  Account showing  that 

defendant is liable to pay the alleged amount of Rs. 73,000/­ alongwith 

interest.  In short, it is concluded that plaintiff has failed to prove that an 

amount   of   Rs.   73,000/­   was   outstanding   against   the   defendant. 

Accordingly, this issue is decided against the plaintiff and in favour of the 

defendant.
