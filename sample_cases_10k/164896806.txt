                          W.P. No. 4242/2018
              (MATA PRASAD KHANDELWAL Vs STATE OF M.P AND ORS.)


Gwalior Bench:
Dated:13/03/2018
        Shri U.K. Bohre, learned counsel for the petitioner.
        Shri Vivek Jain, learned Public Prosecutor for the
respondent/State on advance notice.</pre>
<p id="p_1">        With consent, heard finally.
</p><p id="p_2">        The   present      petition    under     <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1">Article    226</a>         of    the
Constitution of India has been preferred by the petitioner
against the order dated 05/02/2018 (Annexure P/1) passed
by the District Education Officer, District-Bhind/ respondent
No.4,     whereby,      petitioner's     representation           has        been
considered and decided.
</p><p id="p_3">        The grievance as echoed in the writ petition by the
learned counsel for petitioner is that appeal preferred by the
petitioner has been considered and decided in a slip shod
manner and did not consider the appeal in true spirit. It is
further submitted that out of 20 options given by the
petitioner, some options given on option No. 2(Government
Middle School, Bilav, Block Bhind, Distt. Bhind), option No. 3
(Government Middle School, Para, Block Ater, Distt. Bhind)
and option No.5 (Government Middle School, Ethar, Block
Ater, Distt. Bhind), but those options have not been
considered, wherein, post of Headmaster is still lying vacant
in those schools as referred above and the petitioner could
have been accommodated or transferred at those schools list
preference also.
</p><p id="p_4">        Learned counsel for the respondents/ State opposed
the prayer but could not support the impugned order in view
of fact situation addressed by the petitioner and fairly
submits that the matter shall be decided afresh as per the
policy.
</p><p id="p_5">                             THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH
                                             W.P. No. 4242/2018
                                 (MATA PRASAD KHANDELWAL Vs STATE OF M.P AND ORS.)


                            In the earlier round of litigation (W.P. No.5936/2017)
                  vide order dated 08/09/2017, this Court directed the
                  respondents to consider the case of the petitioner as per the
                  policy and preferences given by the petitioner.
</p><p id="p_6">                            Considering the fact situation of the case as well as
                  submissions advanced by both the parties, it appears that
                  the appeal needs to be heard and decided by respondents
                  No.3 and 4 afresh while considering the submissions of the
                  petitioner/objectively. Therefore, while setting aside the
                  impugned order dated 05/02/2018 (Annexure P/1), the
                  matter is remanded back to respondents No.3 and 4 to
                  consider the case of the petitioner in the light of the earlier
                  directions given by this Court as well as the grounds raised
                  in the appeal and thereafter pass a reasoned order under
                  due intimation to the petitioner as expeditiously as possible.
</p><p id="p_7">                            The petition stands disposed of with the aforesaid
                  directions.
</p><p id="p_8">                            For clarity purpose, it is made clear that till the appeal
                  is decided, petitioner shall be allowed to continue at his
                  present place of posting.
</p><p id="p_9">                                                                    (Anand Pathak)
