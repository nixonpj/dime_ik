Writ Petition filed under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India
for issuance of a Writ of Mandamus directing the first and second respondents to
grant patta in respect of the land in occupation by twenty members of the
Association in survey No.B/5 situated in Pandian Street, Paramakudi Town,
Ramanathapuram District applying the G.O. Permanent No.166, Revenue Department
dated 27.03.2000 within the time frame fixed by this Hon'ble Court and not to
disturb their possession in any way till pattas are granted.

!For Petitioner     	... Mr.S.Viswalingam
^For Respondents	... Mr.So.Paramasivam
			    Government Advocate
			   *****

:ORDER
</pre>	
<p id="p_1">	The writ petition has been filed by the association named as Residents
Welfare Association which is a registered association.  The petition has been
filed on the ground that the member of the association have encroached into the
river poramboke in survey No.B/5 situated in Pandian Street, Paramakudi Town,
Ramanathapuram District and such an action has to be regularized by issuance of
Patta.
</p>
<p id="p_2">	2. The only contention raised by the association is that they are well
wishers of the entire body of members and that encroachment which has been made
has got to be regularized as per the G.O. Permanent No.166, Revenue Department
dated 27.03.2000.  It is also contended that the members of the association have
been in possession and enjoyment of the property for a quite long time and
therefore they will come under the parameters as found in  G.O. Permanent
No.166, Revenue Department dated 27.03.2000.  The name list of 20 members of the
association have been given in the writ petition.  The petitioner association
would also contend that they are eligible under the  G.O. Permanent No.166,
Revenue Department dated 27.03.2000.
</p>
<p id="p_3">	3. The Government has filed a detailed counter.  The learned Government
Advocate specifically argued and contended that the writ petition itself is not
maintainable, as the writ petition filed by the association seeking for issuance
of patta for individuals which according to him will vary according to their
requirements and according to their eligibility.  Apart from this, even the
application of the said G.O would be made to anyone only if the lands are not
required by the Government for their usage.  Only then such an application would
be considered as per G.O. Permanent No.166, Revenue Department, dated 27.03.2000
and above all these things, the Executive Engineer, Public Works Department has
filed a detailed counter.  In the counter, he has categorically stated that as
the lands are classified as river poramboke and required for the Government
usage, the lands could not be regularized and have to be made free from
encroachments and that being so as per the classification of the lands which is
a river poramboke no encroachments would bee allowed and hence the writ petition
is legally not sustainable and maintainable.
</p>
<p id="p_4">	4. Heard both parties.  At the outset, the writ petition filed by the
association consisting of 20 members who have encroached into the river
poramboke and seeking for patta as per G.O. Permanent No.166, Revenue Department
dated 27.03.2000, the association cannot plead for the grant of issuance of
patta in respect of various individuals as their eligibility criteria for every
individual and the allotment may differ totally and whereas the G.O. Permanent
No.166, Revenue Department dated 27.03.2000 would be applied only after taking
into consideration of every individual aspect.  Therefore this writ petition
filed by the association seeking for implementation of G.O. Permanent No.166,
Revenue Department dated 27.03.2000 is legally not sustainable or maintainable.
</p>
<p id="p_5">	5. Even otherwise, taking into consideration the merits of the case also
on a reading of the G.O. Permanent No.166, Revenue Department dated 27.03.2000
would only indicate that a committee was constituted to go into the question of
regularization of the poramboke land by a committee provided only if such land
is not required for the purpose which is meant for.  But in this case the
Executive Engineer, Public Works Department who is the competent authority who
maintains the water body level and irrigation has categorically stated that this
is a rive poramboke and the said lands are required for the Government usage and
hence the lands could not be regularized and it has to be removed from the
encroachments.  That being so, the association cannot plead for implementation
of G.O. Permanent No.166, Revenue Department dated 27.03.2000 or seeking the
committee to go into the question whether they are eligible as stated supra
since the association cannot bring the cause for the individuals even if any
individual is entitled, it will be only for the particular individual to seek
the remedy in accordance with law.  This Writ petition at this point of time is
legally not sustainable or maintainable and also even on merits the association
has not made out any case as the Government has specifically stated that they
need the property and encroachment has to be removed.
</p>
<p id="p_6">	6. It is seen from the prayer in the main writ petition that the lands are
situated in survey No.B/5 in Pandian Street, Paramakudi Town, Ramanathapuram
District.  But as pointed out by the Government Advocate, the address given by
the members of the association are located in different places and different
areas and therefore the association cannot plead for the regularization of
encroachment in particular place and include the members residing in another
place.  In any view of the matter, in as much as the area is stated to be a
river poramboke there is no justification for the claim made by the association.
</p>
<p id="p_7">	7. In this connection, I am guided by the two Division Bench judgments of
this Hon'ble Court.  The first judgment reported in 2005 (4) CTC 1 (L.Krishnan
Vs. State of Tamil Nadu, represented by its Secretary, Department of Revenue
(Land Development), Fort St.George, Chennai - 600 009 and others), in which the
Hon'ble then Chief Justice Markandey Katju (as he then was) and Justice
F.M.Ibrahim Kalifulla have categorically held that when the land in question has
been classified as 'Odai Poromboke' in the revenue records then there should be
specific steps taken to make an overall study of all such encroachments in
respect of lands which have been classified as lands meant for the purpose of
storage of water(i.e., ponds, tanks, lakes, etc.) and such a step required to be
taken by the State in order to improve the water storage facility prevailing in
the State since in many parts of Tamil Nadu people are suffering from an acute
shortage of water.
</p><p id="p_8">	8. The Division Bench further held that it is imperative that such natural
resources providing for water storage facilities are maintained by the State
Government by taking all possible steps both by taking preventive measures as
well as by removal of unlawful encroachments.  Finally after relying upon the
various judgments of the Hon'ble Supreme Court, the Division Bench has held as
follows:
</p>
<p id="p_9">"Therefore, we direct the respondents 1 to 5 to take necessary legal steps to
remove the alleged encroachments made by the respondents 6 to 12 as well as the
petitioner over Odai Poramboke in Iyan Punji Survey nO.100/1 at No.247, Tatchur
Village, Kallakurichi Taluk, Villupuram District measuring 5 acres and 70 cents.
Inasmuch as this writ petition has come before us by way of a public interest
litigation, we take this opportunity to direct the State Government to identify
all such natural water resources in different parts of the State and wherever
illegal encroachments are found, initiate appropriate steps in accordance with
the relevant provisions of law for restoring such natural water storage
resources which have been classified as such in the revenue records to its
original position so that the suffering of the people of the State due to water
shortage is ameliorated."
</p>
<p id="p_10">	9. The latest judgment is reported in 2008 1 MLJ 417 (Anti Corruption
Movement, rep. by its General Secretary, Saligramam, Chennai Vs. Government of
Tamil Nadu, rep. by  Secretary, Public Works Department, Chennai and others), in
which the Hon'ble then Chief Justice Ajit Prakash Shah(as he then was) and
Justice P.Jothimani have held as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_11">Having considered the difficulties expressed by the learned Government Pleader
in carrying out the process of removal of encroachments, we pass the following
order:
</p><p id="p_12">(i) The Secretaries, Public Works Department, in consultation with the
respective District Collectors, are directed to decide the programme of evicting
the encroachments in the water bodies falling in Categories 'A' and 'B' referred
to above, by the end of November 2007 and complete the process of removal of
such encroachments by the end of May 2008.
</p>
<p id="p_13">(ii) The State Government is at liberty to consider, in appropriate cases, grant
of alternative sites for re-location of the encroachets, as per their policy
decision.  All the authorities concerned like the local authorities as well as
the police officials, will extend their full cooperation to the the Public Works
Development/District Collectors for effectively implementing the policy decision
of the Government of removal of encroachments from water bodies.
</p>
<p id="p_14">(iii) No Civil Court shall entertain any suit or proceeding in connection with
the removal of the encroachments in the water bodies and every person, who has
put up any construction in such water bodies and who is aggrieved by the action
taken by the authorities of removal of such encroachment from the water bodies,
is at liberty to move this Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_2">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India
and all such applications shall be placed before the First Bench of this Court.
</p>
<p id="p_15">(iv) The State Government is directed to identify and take stern action against
the land grabbers who have sold the lands in the water bodies to innocent
purchasers, which would act as a deterrant.  the survey numbers of the lands in
various water bodies in question are directed to be notified and the
Registration Department concerned is directed not to register any transaction in
respect of such lands falling under the water bodies.
</p><p id="p_16">(v) In respect of the Porur tank, the respondents have already removed all the
encroachments and the said water body is free of any encroachment.  In case any
encroachment is made on the water body in future, it will be open for the
authorities to remove such encroachment even without, issuing any notice to such
encroachers.
</p>
<p id="p_17">(vi) It is also made clear that even after the encroachments from the water
bodies are removed as per the policy decision of the State Government, the
respective District Collectors shall keep a close watch over such water bodies
and in case of any fresh encroachment thereon, the District Collectors are at
liberty to remove the same with the help of police, wherever necessary, without
any notice, to such encroachers.
</p>
<p id="p_18">	10. The endeavor of the Division Benches judgments is categorically to say
that the District Collector will take necessary steps for removal of the
encroachments in respect of tanks, ponds, Odai and continued to be maintained as
the same.  Even if any subsequent encroachments are made, the District
Collectors are at liberty to take necessary steps to remove all such
encroachments.
</p>
<p id="p_19">	11. When that being the case, all the decision reported by this Hon'ble
Court are to be respectfully carried out by the authorities. The arguments of
the petitioner association claiming that the encroachments is river poramboke
has to be regularized is legally not sustainable.  Therefore following the
Division Bench Judgments of this Hon'ble Court, the Association is not entitled
to the relief in the writ petition.
</p>
<p id="p_20">	12. In any view of the matter, as stated supra, since the Government is
requiring the land, the question of implementation of G.O. Permanent No.166,
Revenue Department dated 27.03.2000 will not arise.  In so far as the petitioner
association is concerned if at all the individuals are entitled, they have to
prove the same before the authority concerned in accordance with law and this
petition filed by the association calling upon them to implement G.O. Permanent
No.166, Revenue Department dated 27.03.2000 is legally not sustainable.  Hence
the petition is dismissed.  No costs.  Consequently the connected miscellaneous
petitions are also closed
