<p id="p_1">                                This petition has been filed under <a href="/doc/1783708/" id="a_1">Section 438</a> of Code of

                    Criminal Procedure for grant of anticipatory bail to the petitioners in

                    FIR No. 11 dated 18.09.2013 for offences under <a href="/doc/538436/" id="a_2">Sections 498-A</a> and

                    <a href="/doc/1897847/" id="a_3">120-B</a> of Indian Penal Code (IPC).
</p>
<p id="p_2">                                Petitioners are the parents of husband of the complainant.

                    Learned counsel for the petitioners vehemently contended that the

                    petitioners are not at all at fault and they have been simply roped in

                    the case to harass them.
</p>
<p id="p_3">                                After hearing learned counsel for the petitioners and

                    perusal of the record, the petitioners do not deserve the relief of

                    anticipatory bail. The instant is a classic case in which life of a newly

                    married girl has been ruined just for greed.
</p>
<p id="p_4">                                The marriage of the complainant was solemnized with

                    Ranjit Singh son of petitioners on 28.11.2011 and it is stated that

                    sufficient dowry was given as per status of the parents of complainant.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                     CRM-M-33125 of 2013                                               -2-</span>

                    Even a Bullet Motorcycle was given. Husband of the complainant, who

                    came from Italy went back just 11 days after the marriage. Soon after

                    the marriage petitioners started remarking that dowry worth their status

                    has not been given and they were rather receiving proposals from

                    many rich families. In-laws of the complainant have been demanding a

                    Car or cash amount of ` 5 lacs, which the parents of the complainant

                    were unable to fulfill. The complainant was earlier turned out by the

                    petitioners from matrimonial home but with the intervention of family

                    members of the complainant and the Panchayat members she was

                    rehabilitated. She was again turned out of the matrimonial home in

                    November, 2012 and entire dowry articles were retained. They also

                    kept her certificates and documents.        The complainant filed a

                    complaint before Police in February, 2012 and during the enquiry her

                    in-laws entered into compromise and took her to the matrimonial

                    home.      Ultimately she was turned out of matrimonial home on

                    10.07.2013 after giving her beatings. Report was made to the Police

                    on 24.07.2013 and after enquiry FIR was registered on 18.09.2013.

</p><p id="p_5">                                 In view of the aforesaid facts and circumstance of the

                    case, I do not find any merit in the application for grant of pre-arrest

                    bail and the same is dismissed. The observations made in this order

                    would be without prejudice to the merits of the case or for decision on

                    application for grant of regular bail.
