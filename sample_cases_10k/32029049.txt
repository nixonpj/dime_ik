JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">       This   appeal   is   directed   against   the   judgment   dated

19/2/2007  by which  the  appellant/convict  was convicted  by

learned   Metropolitan   Magistrate,   New   Delhi   under   sections
                                     ­: 2 :­

279/337/304­A   <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_1">IPC</a>   and   was   sentenced   vide   order   dated

24/2/2007 to undergo simple imprisonment for a term of two

months   and   also   to   pay   fine   of   Rs  300/   ­­   for   the   offence

punishable   under   <a href="/doc/1270101/" id="a_2">section   279</a>   IPC,   to   undergo   simple

imprisonment for two months and also to pay a fine in the

the appellant was directed to undergo simple imprisonment

</p>
<p id="p_2">PROSECUTION CASE:
</p>
<p id="p_3">                     In short, the prosecution case before learned trial

court was that on 12/12/1993 at about 3.15 p.m. at Bijwasan

Road near MCD Primary School, village Chhawla, Delhi the

accused was driving truck No.DIG­6502 in a manner so rash

or negligent as to endanger human life and personal safety of

others or to be likely to cause hurt or injury to other persons
                                    ­: 3 :­

and while driving so the  said vehicle he struck against the

motorcycle and caused simple injuries on the person of one

Satpal  the  pillion rider and  caused  death of one  Ajit Singh

who was riding the motorcycle.  
</p>
<p id="p_4">CHARGE AND PLEA  OF THE ACCUSED:
</p>
<p id="p_5">            The Notice under <a href="/doc/429078/" id="a_10">section 251</a> CrPC for the offences

under <a href="/doc/1270101/" id="a_11">section 279</a>/<a href="/doc/1402213/" id="a_12">337</a>/<a href="/doc/409589/" id="a_13">304</a>­A <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_14">IPC</a> was given to the accused

to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed trial.

EVIDENCE:
</p>
<p id="p_6">              In support of its case the prosecution has examined

nine   witnesses   in   all   namely   PW1   Dr.   Archana   ,   PW2   HC

Umed Singh, PW3 Satpal, PW4 Dr. B. Swain, PW5 Naresh,

PW6 Ram Lal, PW7 SI Bhim Singh, PW8 SI Ram Dev and

PW9 HC Kurban Ali.
</p>
<p id="p_7">ARGUMENTS:
</p>
<p id="p_8">        It   is   argued   on   behalf   of   the   appellant   that   the

judgment of trial court is based on conjectures and surmises.

The written arguments filed on behalf of the appellant before

learned trial court were not considered in the judgment so it

is   liable   to   be   set   aside.     It   is   argued   that   the   only

eyewitness/injured in this case PW3 Satpal has stated in the

cross­examination that the motorcycle was being driven at a
                                    ­: 4 :­

speed of 50 or 60 km per hour so the accident has occurred

due   to   rash   driving   of   the   motorcyclist   and   not   of   the

appellant truck driver.  It is argued that PW3 Satpal has not

signed any memo like personal search memo, seizure memo

of   motorcycle,   seizure   memo   the   truck,   seizure   memo   of

driving  license,  and  site  plan  prepared  by the  investigating

officer at the spot which shows that he was not present at the

spot at the time of accident.  It is also argued that PW 3 could

not   give   the   number   of   the   motorcycle   even   in   the   cross­

examination   of   the   learned   Additional   Public   Prosecutor

recorded before learned trial court.   The next argument on

behalf  of the  appellant  is that  the  owner  of  the  truck PW5

Naresh   has   admitted   in   the   cross­examination   that   he   has

two drivers on the truck and has only one truck.  This witness

did   not   support   the   prosecution   story   as   he   has   failed   to

produce any record  showing that the appellant  was driving

the vehicle on the date of the alleged accident.  Therefore, it

is   very   much   doubtful   that   appellant   was   driving   the

vehicle/truck at the time of alleged accident.  It is also argued

that the test identification parade of the accused was not got

conducted which shows that the appellant has not seen the

accident and he has been falsely implicated in this case. It is
                                     ­: 5 :­

argued   that   in   a   statement   under   <a href="/doc/447673/" id="a_15">section   161</a>   CrPC   PW3

Satpal has stated that accident occurred at 3.15 p.m. while in

the statement before court he had given the time 2.30 or 2.45

p.m..  There is no corroboration of the statement of PW3 by

any independent witness.  Therefore, the appellant/convict is

entitled to acquittal.
</p>
<p id="p_9">

</p><p id="p_10">        The arguments of learned Additional Public Prosecutor

are that the appellant was arrested at the spot and the fact

that   he   was   driving   the   vehicle   in   question   in   a   rash   and

negligent manner is proved by the statement of PW3 and the

owner   of   the   truck   in   question   has   also   proved   that   the

appellant   was   driving   the   truck   in   question   of   the   date   of

accident.     The   prosecution,   therefore,   has   proved   its   case

against the appellant/convict beyond reasonable doubt so the

appeal is liable to be dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_11">FINDINGS:
</p>
<p id="p_12">        It   is   true   that   in   the   cross­examination   PW5   Shri

Naresh the owner of the truck in question has stated that he

had   only   one   truck   and   two   drivers   but   in   the   cross­

examination he has denied the suggestion that the accused

was   not   the   driver   on   truck   No.     DIG­6502.     In   the
                                    ­: 6 :­

Examination­in­chief this witness has stated that on the day

of   accident,   the   truck   was   being   driven   by   the   accused

Subash   then   present   in   the   court   on   that   day.     PW3   the

injured and eyewitness Shri Satpal has identified the accused

as the person who was driving the truck in question at the

time of accident.  PW8 SI Ram Dev Singh has stated that he

found the truck and motorcycle in accident condition and the

driver   of   the   truck   Subash   son   of   Ramprasad   was   also

present   at   the   spot.     Therefore,   the   statements   of   the

witnesses conclusively prove that the appellant was driving

the truck in question at the time of accident and was arrested

at the spot by the investigating officer.   If the appellant was

arrested at the spot, the fact that test identification parade of

the   appellant   was   not   conducted   loses   significance.

Therefore, the accused does not derive any benefit out of the

fact   that   no   test   identification   proceedings   of   the   accused

were conducted on the request of the investigating officer.



</p><p id="p_13">        The   fact   that   the   motorcycle   in   question   was   being

driven at the speed of 50 or 60 km per hour by the deceased

in   itself   does   not   show   that   the   accident   occurred   due   to

mistake or rash  diving of the victim deceased.  The manner
                                      ­: 7 :­

in   which   the   accused   was   driving   the   truck   in   question   is

reflected from the statement of the injured PW3 Shri Satpal

who has stated that the truck came from the front side and

the driver suddenly turned the truck on the left side without

giving any signal due to which the motorcycle hit the truck

and   they   both   felt   the   on   the   road.     Further,   in   the   cross­

examination this witness PW3 has denied the suggestion that

the accident occurred as the motorcycle was being driven at

high   speed   and   they   lost   the   control   and   fell   down.     The

testimony   of   the   injured   PW3   cannot   be   doubted   not   only

because he being injured is the eyewitness of the accident in

question but also that he has given the exact reason which

led to the accident in question.  The mere fact that no public

witnesses had come forward to support his evidence and his

testimony   remained   uncorroborated   by   any   independent

witness   does   not   discredit   his   testimony   as   no   particular

number   of   witnesses   is   required   to   prove   a   fact   as   per

<a href="/doc/838383/" id="a_16">section   134</a>   of   the   Indian   Evidence   Act.     Further   a   short

difference  in the  time of accident  given in statement  under

<a href="/doc/447673/" id="a_17">section   161</a>   CrPC   of   the   PW3   and     statement   before   the

learned trial court is not material nor the fact that this witness

did   not   sign   memos   prepared   by   IO   in   the   facts   and
                                      ­: 8 :­

circumstances of the case.
</p>
<p id="p_14">

</p><p id="p_15">        The   death   of   the   motorcycle   rider   Ajit   Singh   in   the

accident in question is proved by PW3 the injured Satpal and

by the investigating officer of the case and also by PW4 Dr B.

Swain who conducted post­mortem on the dead body of Ajit

Singh.  The simple injuries on the person of the injured PW3

Shri   Satpal   are   proved   by   PW6   the   record   clerk   who   has

brought   the   MLC   registered   and   has   proved   the   MLC   Ex

PW6/B  pertaining  to PW3 Shri  Satpal.    Therefore,  besides

proving   rashness   and   negligence   on   the   part   of   the   truck

driver/appellant at the time of the accident the simple injuries

on  the  person  of PW3  Shri Satpal and  death  of the  victim

Shri Ajit Singh are also proved by the prosecution attracting

the   provisions   of   <a href="/doc/1270101/" id="a_18">section   279</a>/<a href="/doc/1402213/" id="a_19">337</a>/<a href="/doc/1371604/" id="a_20">304A</a>   IPC   against   the

appellant/convict.
</p>
<p id="p_16">

</p><p id="p_17">          The   Metropolitan   Magistrate   in   his   judgment   under

<a href="/doc/1684469/" id="a_21">section 355</a> CrPC is only required to give brief statement of

the   reasons   for   the   decision   and   not   all   the   details   of   the

arguments and the facts and the evidence on record.   The

fact   that   the   learned   Metropolitan   Magistrate   has   briefly
                                    ­: 9 :­

referred to the statement of witnesses and his statement of

reasons   is   sufficient   compliance   of   provisional   <a href="/doc/1684469/" id="a_22">section   355</a>

CrPC and he has considered the facts and law properly to

arrive at the correct conclusion with regard to the offences

under <a href="/doc/1402213/" id="a_23">section 337</a> and <a href="/doc/409589/" id="a_24">304</a> IPC under which the appellant is

convicted   by   him.     It   cannot   be   said   that   he   has   not

considered   the   written   arguments   filed   on   behalf   of   the

appellant.   Even otherwise, these argument are specifically

dealt with in this appeal which is only extension of the case

against the accused before learned Metropolitan Magistrate.

</p><p id="p_18">        One   technical   question   that   arises   is   whether

conviction and sentence both under <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_25">section 279</a> and <a href="/doc/409589/" id="a_26">section

304</a> A IPC is permissible under the law as the latter section

caused as a result of the negligent act, he will be guilty of

the offence under s 304A, <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_28">IPC</a>, because an offence under th

<a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_29">section 279</a> is a minor offence which is included in <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_30">Section

304A</a>, <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_31">IPC</a>. (See Esco Mathew v State of Kerala 1967 Ker

LJ   227).   An   accused,   convicted   under   s   304A,   <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_32">IPC</a>,

therefore,   cannot   be   convicted   under     <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_33">section   279</a>   as   the

latter is a minor offence. (Shiva Ram v State 1965 All 196,
                                 ­: 10 :­

(1965) 1 Cr LJ 524; Ranjit Singh v State of Haryana 1988

Chand Cr Cases 516 (P&amp;H)) <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_34">IPC</a>. Our Delhi High Court has

also taken a similar view and it was held that there was no

need to impose any separate sentence for minor sentence

under   <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_35">sections   279</a>   because   the   offence   under   <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_36">sections

304A</a> and <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_37">338</a>, <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_38">IPC</a>, are similar offence in aggravated forms.

Thus   the   sentence   imposed   under   <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_39">section   279</a>   was   set

aside   (See   Abdul   Hameed   v   State  (1990)   41   DLT   306,

307;  Hamid   Khan   v   State  1996   (1)   Crimes   465   (Del).

Therefore,   where   a   person   is   convicted   and   sentenced

under <a href="/doc/1371604/" id="a_40">section 304A</a> IPC a separate conviction under <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_41">Section

279</a>, for the minor offence which is included in the offence

under   s   304­A,   is   not   justified.   (See,  Shiv   Ram   versus

State AIR 1965 All 196). In the light of these authorities the

conviction   and   the   sentence   imposed   upon   the

appellant/convict/accused  by the  learned  trial court for the

offence under <a href="/doc/1270101/" id="a_42">Section 279</a> IPC are liable to be set aside.

</p><p id="p_19">       As   regards   the   sentence   awarded   by   learned   trial

court for the offence under <a href="/doc/1402213/" id="a_43">section 337</a> IPC the same looks to

be proper.  However, the sentence of imprisonment awarded

under  <a href="/doc/409589/" id="a_44">section  304</a>  A IPC of one  year simple  imprisonment

looks to be on higher side keeping in view the fact that the
                                   ­: 11 :­

accident  in  question  occurred  about  15  years  ago  and  the

appellant/convict   has   faced   the   agony   of   trial   and

proceedings in the  appeal for such a long  period  and also

keeping in view the fact that the motorcycle was also on a

high­speed   of   50/60   km   per   hour   as   stated   by   PW3   the

injured   Shri Satpal  in  his  cross­examination.    Therefore,   in

my   view   the   sentence   of   imprisonment   imposed   under

<a href="/doc/1371604/" id="a_45">section 304A</a> IPC needs to be modified from one year simple

imprisonment to six months simple imprisonment.  However,

the sentence of fine imposed under <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_46">section 304</a>­A <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_47">IPC</a> needs

to be maintained.

<p id="p_20">RESULT OF APPEAL:
</p>
<p id="p_21">               In view of the above discussion the conviction and

sentence   passed   by   learned   trial   court   against   the

appellant/convict for the offence under <a href="/doc/1270101/" id="a_48">section 279</a> IPC are

set   aside.     The   conviction   of   the   appellant/convict   for   the

offence under <a href="/doc/1402213/" id="a_49">section 337</a> IPC is maintained.  The conviction

of   the   appellant/convict   under   <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_50">section   304</a>­A   <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_51">IPC</a>   and   also

sentence of fine of rupees 500/ ­­ imposed by learned trial

court   are   maintained   but   the   sentence   of   imprisonment

awarded under <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_52">section 304</a>­A <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_53">IPC</a> is modified from one year

simple   imprisonment   to   six   months   simple   imprisonment.
</p><p id="p_22">                                  ­: 12 :­

Both the substantive sentences under <a href="/doc/1402213/" id="a_54">sections 337</a>/<a href="/doc/1371604/" id="a_55">304A</a> IPC

shall run concurrently. Fine deposited by the appellant under

<a href="/doc/1270101/" id="a_56">section 279</a> IPC be refunded to the appellant by the learned

trial court. The period of detention already undergone by the

appellant during the investigation and trial of this case shall

set off in term of imprisonment imposed against the appellant

under <a href="/doc/914361/" id="a_57">section 428</a> CrPC.     The bail bonds furnished in the

appeal   are   cancelled.     The   trial   court   record   be   returned

along with the copy of this judgment. The judgment be sent

to   the   server   (www.delhidistrictcourts.nic.in).       The   appeal

filed be consigned to the record room.
