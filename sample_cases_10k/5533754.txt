 prosecution case was shrouded with suspicion and hence, the accused 

was entitled to be acquitted in this case.

record.

</p><p id="p_40">17.            The prosecution has examined the complainant (PW­2) 

and   Sh.   Sajeev   Sikka   (PW­1)   in   support   of   its   case.   They   are   the 

material   witnesses.   They   have   no   animosity   against   accused.   The 

PW­1 and PW 2 are the trustworthy witnesses. The defence has failed 

to elicit any material contradictions in their depositions. The defence 

has neither suggested nor demonstrated any plausible reason for the 

PWs deposing against the accused. The minor contradictions, even if 

any, appearing in the testimonies of PWs due to lapse of considerable 

period of time, cannot be held fatal for the prosecution's case which 

otherwise stands good on its own legs.

<p id="p_41">
</p><p id="p_42">18.            In view of clear and cogent evidence of the complainant, 

the  defence  cannot  derive benefit  by contending that site plan was 

prepared in police station or that the complainant had denied that site 

plan was prepared by IO at his instance. Since, no suggestion was ever 

put   to   the  police  witnesses  that  no site  plan was ever  prepared  by 

them. Though accused had cited the previous animosity between him 

and complainant, but he had miserably failed to prove the same. He 

had failed to explain as to why PW 1 Sh. Sanjeev Sikka owner of the 

house   would   have   also   deposed   against   him   and   that   too   at   the 

instance of his security guard as alleged.

complainant   Bhanu   Bahadur,   it   is   therefore,   proved   beyond   any 

reasonable   doubt   that  accused   Mohd.  Islam   had  committed  lurking 

house trespass by entering into the house of the Sanjeev Sikka which 

was used as a human dwelling with intention to commit theft.
