           Station Shimlapuri, Ludhiana City on the statement of Vikramjit

           Singh i.e. the present petitioner, as regards the unnatural death of

           his sister, namely, Jaspal Kaur. Complainant had stated that the

           marriage of his sister Jaspal Kaur had been solemnized about four

           years prior to recording of the statement with Dilraj Singh son of

           Swaran Singh.       At the time of marriage, dowry articles as per

           status, in the nature of motorcycle etc., had been given.          It is

           further alleged that soon after marriage, parents of the husband

           had started harassing Jaspal Kaur for bringing less dowry and

           even the husband used to beat her. Acceding to the demand of

           dowry, a double-bed and `10,000/- in cash were given to Jaspal

           Kaur by mother of complainant, namely, Ravinder Kaur. Further

           allegations are that in the month of April 2012, Jaspal Kaur had

           been given beatings by her husband Dilraj Singh as also his

           parents i.e. Swaran Singh and Prabhjot Kaur and thereafter she

           was turned out of the matrimonial home.         Further allegation is

           that upon death of the father of the complainant, the land was to

           be transferred in equal shares amongst the heirs and about two

           killas of land was coming to the share of deceased Jaspal Kaur.

           Dilraj Singh at such point had been harassing his wife Jaspal Kaur

           to get due share in land so that the same could be sold for the

           purchase of the plot. This was also stated to be a primary reason

           for deceased Jaspal Kaur to be beaten up by her husband Dilraj

           Singh and also his parents. Complainant Vikramjit Singh further

           stated that his 'Bharjai' (wife of brother), namely, Baljit Kaur and a

           resident of Calcutta had also gone to meet deceased Jaspal Kaur

           and at that time also, the deceased had disclosed that she was

           returning back to her paternal home as the dispute had taken

           place between the husband and wife on account of demand of a

           Car. On the date of recording of the statement, a phone call from

           Prabhjot Kaur i.e. mother-in-law of the deceased was stated to

           have been received at about 2.30 p.m. that Jaspal Kaur had

           suffered a heart attack and had expired.

           Code of Criminal Procedure seeking to summon the in-laws,

           namely, Swaran Singh and Prabhjot Kaur as additional accused

           has merely noticed that during the course of investigation

           conducted by police authorities, Swaran Singh and Prabhjot Kaur

           had been found innocent and             kept in column No.2 of the final

           registered as also the statement of Vikramjit Singh recorded by

           the Court as PW1 and placed on record as Annexure P5. In the

           Procedure as also in his testimony before the Court, complainant

           <a href="/doc/435819/" id="a_6">Section 319</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure had come up for

           consideration. <a href="/doc/1860679/" id="a_7">In Municipal Corporation of Delhi v. Ram Kishan

                                                      73 the Court had

           struck a note of caution by saying that the power to be exercised

           under <a href="/doc/435819/" id="a_8">Section 319</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure is an extra-

           ordinary power which is conferred on the Court and should be

           <a href="/doc/435819/" id="a_10">Section 319</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure is that the Court

           must have reasonable satisfaction from the evidence already

           that some other person, who is not arraigned as an accused in
