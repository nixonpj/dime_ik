    THIS WRIT APPEAL HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON
31-10-2016, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY DELIVERED THE FOLLOWING:



                     ANTONY DOMINIC
                                &amp;

                   W. A. No.2135 of 2016

          Dated this the 31st day of October, 2016

                          JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">Antony Dominic, J.
</p>
<p id="p_2">      1. aThe petitioner in W.P.(C) No.38041 of 2015 is the

appellant. In the writ petition filed by her, she sought to

quash Exts.P15 and P16, to the extent of withholding the

salaries. The writ petition, in question, was disposed of by

the learned single Judge, directing the DPI to consider rival

claims raised by the appellant and the fifth respondent in

the light of Ext.R5(a). It is this judgment which is under

challenge.
</p>
<p id="p_3">      2. We heard the learned senior counsel appearing for

the   appellant   and    the   learned    Government     Pleader

appearing for the official respondents.

</p><p id="p_4">      3. The contention now raised before us is that having

upheld the validity of Exts.P8 and P9, the learned single

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">W. A. No.2135 of 2016         -2-</span>



Judge should not have directed reconsideration of the claim

raised by the fifth respondent in the light of Ext.R5(a).

However, we are unable to agree with the counsel. A

reading of the judgment under appeal and the pleadings in

the writ petition show that the fifth respondent's claim on

the basis of Ext.R5(a) was never considered by anyone of

the authorities. It was on account of that fact that the

learned single Judge after upholding Exts.P8 and P9 directed

consideration of the rival claims taking due note of Ext.R5

</p><p id="p_5">(a), the Government Order which directs regularisation of

the teachers working as leave substitutes against the first

arising vacancy. According to us, such a direction cannot be

said to be in conflict with any other finding contained in the

judgment.
</p>
<p id="p_6">         4. The other apprehension expressed by the learned

senior counsel for the appellant was that the findings in the

judgment indicate that the learned single Judge has

concluded that the fifth respondent is entitled to the benefit

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">W. A. No.2135 of 2016            -3-</span>



of Ext.R5(a). According to us, a reading of the judgment

itself would belie this contention and that the whole issue is

now open before the D.P.I.
</p>
<p id="p_7">       In such circumstances, confirming the judgment under

appeal, this appeal is dismissed.
