BY THE COURT: </pre>
		
<p id="p_1">		Since this bunch of writ petitions involve similar controversy thus all the writ petitions are  heard together and decided by this common order. 
</p>
<p id="p_2">		These writ petitions pertain to selection to the posts of Driver, Conductor and other posts pursuant to the advertisement issued in the year 2010. In fact, two advertisements were issued by the respondents, however, final advertisement was issued on 24.9.2010 in view of amendment in the Regulations. During the  course of selection and subsequent thereto, many litigations came before this court and were decided. 
</p>
<p id="p_3"> 		It would be necessary to give brief history of previous litigations. 
</p>
<p id="p_4">		First bunch of writ petitions was decided by this court led by Narpat Dan Versus RSRTC &amp; anr, SB Civil Writ Petition No. 2183/2011, decided on 31.5.2011 at Principal Seat, Jodhpur, reported as 2011 (3) WLC (Rajasthan) page 677. Therein, it was held that reserve category candidates obtained higher marks than the general/ open category candidates in written examination cannot be held ineligible  for trade test thus respondents were directed to re-notify cut off marks of the  written examination.  The aforesaid litigation came when cut off marks of general/ open  category was provided as 65 marks, whereas, for OBC category it was 77 marks. After the judgment in the case aforesaid, respondents re-notified cut off marks of the written examination. For general/open category, it was 75 marks, whereas, for OBC category candidates it was  71 marks. 
</p>
<p id="p_5">		The second litigation came in regard to the qualification of Driver and Conductor. A conductor was asked to possess Conductor's licence as well as driving licence without amendment in the Regulations as per <a href="/doc/951936/" id="a_1">Section 45</a> of the State Road Transport Corporation Act. Second bunch of writ petitions was decided by this court led by Nirmal Kumar Jain &amp; ors versus RSRTC &amp; ors, SB Civil Writ Petition No.14710/2010 vide order dated 2.9.2011. It was held that without amendment in the Regulations as per <a href="/doc/951936/" id="a_2">section 45</a> of the Road Transport Corporation Act, it cannot be given effect to so as to impose requirement of driving licence for the post of Conductor. 
</p>
<p id="p_6">		The third litigation was decided by this court in the bunch of writ petitions led by Prem Prakash Sharma versus RSRTC &amp; anr, SB Civil Writ Petition No. 13855/2011, on 9.11.2011, wherein, disposal of the writ petitions was on agreed terms thus directions given therein remain for petitioners only and for earlier litigants specified therein. 
</p>
<p id="p_7">		So far as present writ petitions are concerned, they involve certain questions concerned to the aforesaid selection itself. Since many fold grievances have been raised thus they are decided as follows - 
</p>
<p id="p_8">Issue No.1  
	Learned counsel for petitioners allege that the candidates failed to secure required cut off marks in the written examination have been given appointment leaving those who are better placed. It is also submitted that there are candidates who have not  secured  final cut off marks, yet given appointment. 
</p>
<p id="p_9">		Learned counsel for respondents submit that for general category, initially, cut off marks in written examination were 65, later on, it was changed to 75 however  pursuant to the directions of this court in the case of Prem Prakash Sharma (supra)  those  candidates were adjudged suitably for trade test  if secured earlier cut off marks but subject to the condition that they had earlier approached this court. This is in view of the fact that they were not party in the case of Narpat Dan (supra)  thus judgment in that case should not have adversely affected them. 
</p>
<p id="p_10">		I find that while making selection, respondents determined cut off marks on two occasions. Initially, on completion of written examination so as to make candidates eligible for trade test. The cut off marks was changed in view of the judgment in the case of   Narpat Dan (supra). The revision of cut off marks was made from lower to higher only for general/ open  category candidates otherwise it was lowered down for reserve category candidates. However, it was without hearing them either in the case of Narpat Dan (supra) or by the respondents thus a direction was given by this court in the case of Prem Prakash Sharma (supra) to consider petitioners therein for appointment but it was only for general/ open  category candidates who had secured higher marks than initial cut off marks. Hence, if any candidate failed to secure cut off marks either prescribed initially or later on yet allowed in the trade test and selected leaving the petitioners then action of the respondents is  discriminatory and illegal.  
</p>
<p id="p_11">		It is also seen by this court that even the candidates secured less marks than the final cut off marks, have also been selected and appointed. The aforesaid is also illegal as respondents cannot ignore candidates having higher marks. 
</p>
<p id="p_12">		It is seen that earlier cut off marks for general category candidates was 65, whereas, for OBC it was 77. Aforesaid cut off marks were changed, making it 75 marks for general category and 71 for OBC category to become eligible for trade test. As per the judgment in the case of Prem Prakash Shama (supra), general category candidates, who approached this court in the aforesaid set of petitions on or  prior to  9.11.2011 would be entitled to the benefit of earlier cut off marks thus, if any other candidate was  permitted to appear in the trade test followed by selection and appointment without obtaining required cut off marks in the written examination then it is due to default of the respondents. The respondents are accordingly directed to reconsider the matter so that  no candidate is continued if obtained less marks than final cut off marks or the cut off marks of the written examination. If respondents intend to continue them,  then petitioners who have secured better marks would also  be eligible for appointment. The direction aforesaid would be applied after taking precaution of those candidates belonging to open/ general category and were part of the litigation in the case of Prem Prakash Sharma (supra) or in the earlier litigation thus covered by the  direction No.4 in the case of Prem Prakash Sharma (supra) because their required cut off marks for written examination  would be 65 but not for others. The aforesaid arrangement was allowed in view of the consent of the Corporation in the case of Prem Prakash Sharma (supra),  however, if general category candidates had not approached this court before 9.11.2011 then they would not be entitled to such benefit because consent of the Corporation cannot be applied in rem, rather, their candidature would be considered as per the revised cut off marks. Accordingly, first issue is allowed in favour of the petitioners. Respondents would be free to discontinue the candidates if appointed ignoring  cut off marks in the written examination or final cut off marks. The discontinuance would  however be after giving an opportunity of hearing to them. In case they are continued despite their low marks than cut off marks then those petitioners, who have obtained higher marks, would be entitled to appointment. 
</p>
<p id="p_13">Issue No.2 - 
</p><p id="p_14">	Second issue raised by the petitioners is arising out of the judgment in the case of Prem Prakash Sharma (supra). In the aforesaid judgment, it was agreed that those petitioners, who were not in possession of driving licence and applied for the post of Conductor, would be given proportionate marks in the trade test on the formula given in the said judgment. 
</p>
<p id="p_15">		It is contended that the formula so evolved by this court in the case of Prem Prakash Sharma (surpa) should have been applied irrespective of the fact as to whether candidate approached this court on or before 9.11.2011. This is more so when many candidates, who had not even  earlier challenged the  condition to possess driving licence for the post of Conductor yet  given benefit of revised marks in the trade test based on the formula evolved by this court. 
</p>
<p id="p_16">		Learned counsel for respondents submit that revised marks in the trade test have been allowed only in favour of those who approached this court on or before 9.11.2011 thus covered by the judgment in the case of Prem Prakash Sharma (supra). In fact, judgment in the case of Prem Prakash Sharma (supra) was on agreed terms thus is not applicable in rem. Those, who failed to approach this court in time, were not given benefit of said judgment as finality to the selection was given immediately after judgment in the aforesaid case,  accordingly, appointments were made. If any candidate has been given benefit of revised marks in the trade test though did not approach this court on or before 9.11.2011, corrective action would be taken by the Corporation in those cases. 
</p>
<p id="p_17">		I have considered the submissions of learned counsel for parties and find that judgment in the case of Prem Prakash Sharma (supra) was more or less on agreed terms. As per the judgment in the case of Prem Prakash Sharma (supra), revised marks in the trade test was to be applied. The issue aforesaid was considered in the light of the condition to possess driving licence for the post of Conductor and it was only for those who were not in possession of driving licence. The challenge to the condition was thus not made by those who were  having driving licence while applying for the post of Conductor. To clarify the aforesaid, the revised criteria for trade test was applicable only on those who approached this court on or before 9.11.2011 i.e. the date of judgment in the case of Prem Prakash Sharma (supra) or in the earlier judgment in the case of Nirmal Kumar Jain (supra). The judgment aforesaid is not applicable to those who were in possession of driving licence so as Conductor's licence while applying for the post of Conductor and failed to challenge it before appointment. If the Corporation has revised the marks of trade test even for those candidates who were in possession of  driving licence and not earlier challenged the condition to possess driving licence while applying for the post of Conductor, are not to be governed by the directions in the case of Prem Prakash Sharma (supra). It is for the reason that immediately after the judgment in the case of Prem Prakash Sharma (supra), appointments were given thus whoever failed to approach this court before appointment cannot be governed by the earlier judgment due to delay and consent of the Corporation is limited to those earlier petitions. Accordingly, if the Corporation has revised the marks of the trade test for those who are in  possession of driving licence while applying for the post of Conductor or for those  who had not  approached this court on or before 9.11.2011 and denied  benefit of revised marks to the petitioners then their action becomes discriminatory in nature. Accordingly, they are directed either to withdraw benefit of revised marks in the trade test for those who were not before the court on or before 9.11.2011 and otherwise the condition was not challenged as candidates were in possession of driving licence. If the appointments are cancelled in those cases, it should be by applying principles of natural justice. In case, respondent Corporation takes  a decision to continue them, then all the petitioners  would be eligible for revised cut off marks in the trade test, who  applied for the post of Conductor and if find more marks than  of candidates appointed, would also be eligible for appointment. The limited application of earlier judgment with cut off date in the case of Prem Prakash Sharma  (supra) can be in view of judgment of the Apex Court in the case of Kailash Chand Sharma versus State of Rajasthan &amp; ors, reported as (2002) 6 SCC 562. Therein also, petitions  filed after the  earlier and main judgment were not entertained. 
</p>
<p id="p_18">Issue No.3 - 
</p><p id="p_19">	The third issue pertains to certain questions having wrong answers and even recommended by the committee to delete them. 
</p>
<p id="p_20">		Learned counsel for petitioners submit that PHS Consultants Pvt Ltd, the company conducted the examination, admitted that three questions were having problem as one question was having all options wrong, whereas, in other two questions, wrong answers were accepted as right answers.  The respondent Corporation deleted only one question, accordingly, bonus mark was given for one question, however, as per report of the committee, two questions  were having wrong answers yet no action was taken to award marks to the candidates opted for correct answers. 
</p>
<p id="p_21">		Learned counsel for respondent Corporation submit that so far as one question is concerned, it has already been deleted and bonus mark has been awarded. So far as other two questions are concerned, agency informed about it on 16.1.2012 though  prior to it, appointments were given thus selection process had already been completed. The issue regarding two incorrect answers was never raised by the petitioners. 
</p>
<p id="p_22">		I have considered submissions of learned counsel for parties. I find that in few petitions, issue has been raised for denial of marks to the petitioners though they had given correct answers. It was precisely for the reason that answer key of the two questions were set with the wrong answer. The consultant had realised the mistake. In view of the aforesaid, petitioners who had given correct answer of the question, could not secure marks, whereas, the candidate, who had given incorrect answer, could get marks on account of faulty answer key for two questions. The respondent Corporation should have rectified the list, however, I find that now not only select list has been finalised but appointments have also been given to the candidates. If a direction is given to amend the entire select list, then it will unsettle the entire selection and appointment, that too, without hearing the candidates, who have already been appointed. Thus, to balance the equities, it is directed to the respondent Corporation to re-assess the marks of those petitioners who have raised the aforesaid issue and if they had given correct answers as per the report of the consultant, then may be awarded marks as a consequence thereof. If, after carrying out the direction aforesaid, marks of such petitioners comes equivalent or more than the cut off then their cases for appointment may be considered  if they are otherwise found eligible and meritorious, then be given appointment without disturbing the appointments of other candidates. 
</p>
<p id="p_23">		The direction aforesaid would apply only in those cases where the issue for wrong answer has been raised and not to other petitioners where this issue has not been raised. The directions aforesaid has also been given in the peculiar circumstances with limited application so that settled things may not be unsettled unnecessarily and to avoid multiplication of litigation. 
</p>
<p id="p_24">Issue No.4 - 
</p><p id="p_25">	The fourth issue pertains to medical fitness of the candidates. It is mainly in regard to the condition of colour blindness for the post of Conductor. 
</p>
<p id="p_26">		It is stated by learned counsel for petitioners that colour blindness may be material for the post of Driver but not for the post of Conductor, however,  respondents adjudged many candidates to be unsuitable finding them to be suffering from colour blindness ignoring that aforesaid is not required for the post of Conductor. 
</p>
<p id="p_27">		Learned counsel for respondent Corporation, on the other hand, submit that as and when a candidate made a request, medical examination was got conducted from SMS Hospital, Jaipur. The court earlier directed to conduct medical examination  for the post of Driver thus it has nothing to do with the post of Conductor but medical fitness for the post of Conductor is also required and one is having colour blindness then he is not  suitable for the post. 
</p>
<p id="p_28">		I have considered submissions of learned counsel and find that who is medically suitable for the post of Conductor and Driver is to be determined by the respondent Corporation. If a decision is taken to hold a candidate to be medically unfit  for the post of Conductor, if he is  having colour blindness then no interference is required to be made, however, if colour blindness is not coming in the way of the post of Conductor then respondent Corporation is directed  to reconsider the matter to enable a candidate to get appointment to the post of Conductor subject to his merit, if he is declared  medically unfit on account of colour blindness while seeking selection on the post of Conductor. Accordingly issue aforesaid is left for the Corporation to determine by a speaking order as to whether colour blindness would be an impediment to get appointment on the post of Conductor. In case it is held that colour blindness would not be a bar to seek appointment on the post of Conductor then petitioners should not be debarred from  appointment to the post of Conductor  on the ground of colour blindness subject to their merit. In case decision is taken otherwise, then petitioners would not be entitled to appointment on the aforesaid ground. 
</p>
<p id="p_29">Issue No.5 - 
</p><p id="p_30">	The fifth issue is in regard to revision of marks in trade test on the formula given by this court in the case of Prem Prakash Sharma (supra). The issue aforesaid is nothing but repetition of the issue already determined at issue No.2 thus needs no elaboration and direction. 
</p>
<p id="p_31">Issue No.6 -
</p><p id="p_32">	It is stated  that  condition to obtain minimum passing marks in the trade test was not accepted by this court in the case of Prem Prakash Sharma (supra) thus appointment should have been given irrespective of marks in  trade test. 
</p>
<p id="p_33">		Learned counsel for respondents submit that condition to possess minimum passing marks has not been waived in all cases but was  re-calculated for the petitioners who approached this court earlier  to challenge  the condition to possess driving licence. In fact, the issue aforesaid was decided after holding that driving licence is not required  by the candidate applied for the post of Conductor. However, requirement of passing marks in trade test was not done away in general and  earlier judgment is not applicable in rem as the judgment dated 9.11.2011 was rendered on agreed terms. If issues are kept open then process of  appointments cannot be  completed  at any point of time without limiting  cut off date to approach this court. The view is supported by the judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Kailash Chand Sharma etc versus State of Rajasthan &amp; ors, reported as (2002 ) 6 SCC 562. 
</p>
<p id="p_34">		I have considered the submissions and find that the issue for  possession of minimum marks in the trade test was challenged. The challenge was by those who could not obtain minimum required marks in the trade test in absence of knowledge of driving  and driving licence thus  minimum marks could not be obtained by them  because they were trade tested for driving thus unable to secure marks. The Corporation accordingly agreed to ignore passing marks in the trade test so that appointment may be made timely. This court accordingly issued directions as agreed by the Corporation, however, direction in the case of Prem Prakash Sharma (supra) was applicable to the petitioners approached therein or on earlier occasion in the case of Nirmal Kumar Jain (supra). It is mainly for the reason that those who did not approach this court in time cannot be given benefit by keeping selection   open indefinitely. Accordingly, judgment dated 9.11.2011 is on the agreed terms of the Corporation thus cannot be treated to be a judgment in rem but was applicable to the petitioners therein. If fact, if number of petitioners would have been more even at the initial time, the Corporation was at liberty to make contest, however, taking note of the size of the petitioners on earlier occasion and urgency of recruitment, if Corporation has agreed for certain terms, then it cannot be considered to be a direction in rem but is limited to the petitioners there in the earlier litigation. Accordingly, issue No.6 is decided against the petitioners and in favour of respondent Corporation.
</p>
<p id="p_35">Issue No.7 -
</p><p id="p_36">		Issue aforesaid pertains to  the act of discrimination in regard to the candidates having spectacles correction. The issue aforesaid has not been pressed by the petitioners, accordingly, dismissed. 
</p>
<p id="p_37">Issue No.8 - 
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">		It is urged that candidates from waiting list were given appointment subsequent to the judgment in the case of Prem Prakash Sharma (supra) by  issuing of lists on three occasions though such candidates should not have been given appointment as the reserve list can be used only when a candidate has failed to join the post, however, respondent Corporation made appointment of the candidates from reserve list. 
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">		Learned counsel for respondent Corporation submit that few candidates were appointed from the reserve list. It was only those who secured equal marks to the cut off. It was due to non-joining of the candidates from the main list. 
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">		I have considered the submissions and find that the reserve/ waiting list can be operated only when a candidate failed to join the post, however, in the present matter, it is not indicated as to who was the candidate(s)  failed to join the post though averment in the reply exist to the aforesaid effect but it is quite vague. If candidate(s) from waiting/ reserve list has been appointed, it is required to be reviewed by the respondent Corporation as definite directions for their discontinuance is not given in absence of an opportunity of hearing to them  and as they are not party to the litigation. In any case, respondent Corporation would review the issue aforesaid. If the candidates  appointed from the waiting list or had not earlier approached this court yet given benefit of revised marks in the trade test or ignored the required passing marks in the trade test then their order of appointment needs to be reviewed. However, if a decision is taken to discontinue them, it would be after an opportunity of hearing.  If any candidate is  appointed though secured less than the cut off marks then there would be no justification to continue him but, again, it would be done after affording them an opportunity of hearing. Aforesaid issue is decided accordingly. 
</blockquote>
<p id="p_38">Issue No.9 - 
</p><p id="p_39">	It is alleged that certain petitioners were there in the litigation in the case of Nirmal Kumar Jain (supra) and in connected petitions yet not given benefit of the directions issued in the case of Prem Prakash Sharma (supra) to the extent it was made applicable. This is in regard to the condition to possess driving licence while applying for the post of Conductor. 
</p>
<p id="p_40">		Learned counsel for respondents submit that those governed by the judgment in the case of Prem Prakash Sharma (supra) and were petitioners therein or in the case of Nirmal Kumar Jain (supra) have been extended benefit, if they were not in possession of driving licence while applying for the post of Conductor. It was applied only for those who had challenged the aforesaid condition. 
</p>
<p id="p_41">		I have considered the submissions. The judgment in the case of Prem Prakash Sharma (supra) is very clear, wherein, while issuing directions in regard to the condition to possess driving licence and revised criteria for trade test, it was applied  to the petitioners therein and  who were there in the earlier litigation in the case of Nirmal Kumar Jain (supra). Respondents have accepted the aforesaid thus, if any of the petitioners who was there in the earlier litigation in the case of Nirmal Kumar Jain or Prem Prakash Sharma (supra) then they would be entitled to the benefit of revised criteria as laid down in the case of Prem Prakash Sharma (supra). The issue is accordingly decided in favour of the petitioners. If any of the candidates secured required cut off marks then he would be entitled for appointment. 
</p>
<p id="p_42">Issues No.10 to 16 - 
</p><p id="p_43">	The issues No.10 to 16 are either stand decided while deciding the earlier issues  or are not pressed thus need no elaboration and decision as agreed by both the parties. 
</p>
<p id="p_44">		With the aforesaid, all the issues raised by the petitioners in reference to the earlier recruitment to the post of Conductor, Driver etc, the writ petitions and review petitions  are disposed of with the directions to the respondents for compliance within  a period of two months from the date of receipt of copy of this order. 
</p>
<p id="p_45">NEW RECRUITMENT

		It is a case where after the earlier recruitment pursuant to the advertisement in the year 2010, respondents issued another advertisement in the year 2012 for filling the posts of Driver, Conductor etc. Certain issues have been raised in reference to the new recruitment thus are decided by this common judgment itself. 
</p>
<p id="p_46">1.		The new recruitment provides award of bonus marks based on experience. Challenge to the aforesaid has been made by the candidates who have either been denied benefit of experience or challenged the condition  showing it to be discriminatory in nature. 
</p>
<p id="p_47">		Learned counsel for respondents state that benefit of bonus marks towards experience would not be awarded as  policy decision has been taken to withdraw it.
</p>
<p id="p_48">		In view of submission of learned counsel for the respondents, challenge to the award of bonus marks no more survives as it has been withdrawn. 
</p>
<p id="p_49">2.		Second issue pertains to driving licence by those who have applied for the post of Conductor. 
</p>
<p id="p_50">		Learned counsel for petitioners submit that amendment in the Regulations  has not been made thus condition to possess driving licence cannot be imposed. 
</p>
<p id="p_51">		Learned counsel for respondents, on the other hand, submit that condition to possess driving licence would not be imposed in the new recruitment but if Regulations are amended then those appointed on the post of Conductor will give an undertaking to possess driving licence within a period of two years from the date of notification of amended Regulations. By the aforesaid, they would be kept at par with  earlier appointees. 
</p>
<p id="p_52">		I have considered the submission and find that respondents themselves have done away with the condition to possess driving licence by those applied for the post of Conductor thus, presently, aforesaid condition would not be imposed. The respondent Corporation would however be at liberty to impose such a condition if, finally, Regulations are amended. If any undertaking is required as was then in the previous litigation in the case of Prem Prakash Sharma (supra) then Corporation  would be at liberty to impose such a condition but merely that certain candidates are not in possession of driving licence at present, would not be debarred to apply and compete in the selection for the post of Conductor. 
</p>
<p id="p_53">3. 		The third issue pertains to the qualification. It is submitted that under the Act, required qualification is only VIIIth pass. Respondent Corporation put a condition to possess Secondary Certificate ignoring the aforesaid. I find that the condition to possess required qualification should be as per the Regulations. If Regulations provide Secondary to be minimum qualification, then the aforesaid condition would be adhered to. This is more so when it has not been challenged. If Regulations itself provide qualification of VIIIth  then the Corporation will not debar the candidate(s) in absence of the qualification of Secondary, if he is otherwise in possession the qualification of Class VIIIth pass and other condition of eligibility.  
</p>
<p id="p_54">		With the aforesaid, all the writ petitions pertaining to new recruitment so as the stay applications  are disposed of. 
</p>
<p id="p_55">		In view of the directions and observations made above, review petitions preferred by the respondent Corporation and private petitioners also stand disposed of.
