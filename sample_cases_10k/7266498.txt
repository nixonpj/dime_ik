CORAM:
HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE SURESH KAIT

SURESH KAIT, J.
</pre>
<p id="p_1">1.     By way of the present petitions filed under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_1">Section 482</a> Cr.P.C.
petitioners seek directions thereby quashing of criminal complaint filed by


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">Crl. M.C. Nos.3003/2002 &amp; 5093/2003                              Page 1 of 29</span>
 respondent Enforcement Directorate against the petitioners. The petitioners
also seek directions to quash the order dated 30.05.2002, whereby they
have been summoned.
</p>
<p id="p_2">2.       Since both the petitions have arisen from the impugned order dated
30.05.2002 and issues are same, therefore, these petitions are being
decided by this common judgment.
</p>
<p id="p_3">3.       Crl. M.C. 3003/2002 has been preferred by a Company, i.e., M/s.
National Fertilizers, a Public Sector Undertaking of the Government of
India (hereinafter referred to as the petitioner company), whereas Crl. M.C.
5093/2003 has been preferred by employees of above named Company.
</p>
<p id="p_4">4.       It is important to note that vide orders dated 03.10.2002 and
16.12.2003 proceedings against the petitioners have been stayed by this
Court.
</p>
<p id="p_5">5.       The facts of the cases in brief are that petitioners company deals in
fertilizers, heavy chemicals and their by-products including manufacturing
and distribution and in case of necessity arises for the country, the
Company was authorized to import such items from any country outside
India.
</p>
<p id="p_6">6.       Mr. Dinesh Mathur, ld. Sr. Counsel appearing on behalf of the
petitioners company and Mr. Rajeev Khosla, ld. Counsel appearing for the
petitioners employees submitted that the complaint in question was filed
during the sunset period, i.e., in the year 2002 alleging therein that in the
year 1995, the petitioners employees along with other co-accused persons



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">Crl. M.C. Nos.3003/2002 &amp; 5093/2003                              Page 2 of 29</span>
 while working in State Bank of India ('SBI') violated the provisions of
<a href="/doc/27905/" id="a_2">Foreign Exchange Regulation Act</a>, 1973 (hereinafter referred to as
'FERA') as the petitioners company while acting as a canalizing agency
for import of fertilizers entered into a contract with one Turkish Company
namely M/s. Karsan Ltd. for supply of 200000 Metric Tons of Urea and
made full advance payment to them to the tune of US$ 38 million without
either obtaining any prior permission of the Reserve Bank of India ('RBI')
or any guarantee from an International Bank of repute situated outside
India to safeguard their money. The said Company was obliged to comply
with these requirements for any payments exceeding US$ 5000. Similar
allegations are against the SBI. Accordingly, the petitioners company as
well as SBI Officers allegedly were made liable under Section 56 of FERA
and its employees become vicariously liable for the alleged acts of the said
Company under <a href="/doc/1523435/" id="a_3">Section 56</a> read with Section 68 of FERA. The petitioners
were also sought to be made liable under <a href="/doc/1639853/" id="a_4">Sections 6</a> (4) &amp; (5), 8 (1),(3) &amp;
(4), 9(1)(f)(i) and (3), 49, 64(2) and 73 (3) read with Section 68 of FERA.
</p>
<p id="p_7">7.     Ld. Sr. Counsel further submitted that the complaint is contrary to
the investigation and chargesheet filed by the CBI in case bearing No.RC-
3A/96-ACU-1. The CBI, in fact, found that the petitioners company was
the victim of the conspiracy of the accused therein punishable under
<a href="/doc/1897847/" id="a_5">sections 120B</a>/<a href="/doc/386021/" id="a_6">201</a>/<a href="/doc/1326844/" id="a_7">409</a> and <a href="/doc/1436241/" id="a_8">420</a> of IPC and <a href="/doc/1484602/" id="a_9">Section 13</a> (2) read with
<a href="/doc/1484602/" id="a_10">Section 13</a> (1) (c) and (d) of <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_11">Prevention of Corruption Act</a>. Some of the
petitioners employees therein were placed in column no. 2 of the
chargesheet filed by CBI in above-mentioned FIR and have been cited as
witnesses while remaining petitioners employees found no mention at all



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">Crl. M.C. Nos.3003/2002 &amp; 5093/2003                             Page 3 of 29</span>
 in the chargesheet.     Thus, the present case is completely opposed to the
findings reached by the CBI. It cannot, therefore, be comprehended, how
when one investigation agency had already investigated the facts and
circumstances which amounts to the allegations in the instant case, that too
in the year 1996 itself. Hence, the institution of the complaint in question
is nothing but an attempt to abuse the process of law and appears to be
based on frivolous charges and is an afterthought complaint.
</p>
<p id="p_8">8.     Ld. Sr. Counsel further submitted that the petitioners employees
have been arrayed as witnesses in CBI case mentioned above.        Some of
them have already been testified while others are now reluctant to do so,
although their testimonies in that matter are of critical importance as they
feared that the same would most certainly be used in some manner against
them in the impugned case. Thus, CBI case shall be prejudiced and its
progress may be hampered and hence, the prosecution of the petitioners
employees would not be in the interest of justice.
</p>
<p id="p_9">9.     Ld. Sr. Counsel further submitted that the effect of instance of
prosecution would also prejudicially exposed the petitioners employees to
testimonial compulsions which is prohibited by virtue of <a href="/doc/366712/" id="a_12">Article 20 (3)</a> of
the Constitution of India, 1950, which gives protection against self-
incrimination, as upheld by the Supreme Court in the case of M.P. Sharma
Vs. Satish Chandra, [1954] 1 SCR 1077.
</p>
<p id="p_10">10.    Further submitted that ld. Trial Court was mislead by the respondent
as they suppressed the material fact that the petitioners company had
initiated Arbitration proceedings for recovery of cheated/defrauded money



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">Crl. M.C. Nos.3003/2002 &amp; 5093/2003                            Page 4 of 29</span>
 from M/s. Karsan and its Banks. The petitioners company has kept the
Reserve Bank apprised of its steps to recover its amount of money from the
aforesaid Company and its Banks. The proceedings contemplated in the
instant case would also possibly have adverse consequences on the
execution proceedings initiated by the petitioners company in different
countries for bringing back the amounts paid in respect to contracts for the
import of urea, and in fact negates the efforts of the petitioners Company
and its Officers in recovering the money siphoned out by the actual
culprits, i.e., the accused in the CBI case.
</p>
<p id="p_11">11.    Ld. Sr. Counsel further submitted that as regards the petitioner
company, a bare reading of the allegations shows that the Provisions of
Section 56 of FERA along with alleged offences/violations are not even
protected as none of the violations are alleged out against the petitioners
company.       Perusal of aforesaid Section shows that it is the duty of
authorized agent that before engaging/undertaking in any transaction
involving in foreign exchange, it has to take care of the directions and
instructions issued by the RBI from time to time and in necessary cases it
has to obtain previous permission of the Reserve Bank of India. Thus, in
all the cases, it is the liability, responsibility and duty of the authorized
dealer that he should be satisfied as to the genuineness of the dealings in
foreign exchange and if not so satisfied, report to the RBI for its necessary
directions. The authorized dealer in the instant case was the SBI and the
petitioners company and its employees had neither any role to play nor any
duty to perform in the light of the provisions of the aforesaid Sections.
Furthermore, there is no question of attaching vicarious liability on the



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">Crl. M.C. Nos.3003/2002 &amp; 5093/2003                             Page 5 of 29</span>
 petitioners for the actions of any entity of the Government including SBI.
</p>
<p id="p_12">12.    Further there are no specific allegations in the complaint against the
petitioners employees, except vague and general allegations that the
petitioners were liable and responsible for the work of the petitioners
company. Thus, the complainant failed to demonstrate the existence of
nexus between the petitioners employees and commission of alleged
offence under <a href="/doc/1523435/" id="a_13">Section 56</a> read with Section 68 of FERA.
</p>
<p id="p_13">13.    Ld. Sr. Counsel further submitted that the respondent Enforcement
Directorate has filed the present complaint after a long delay of 7 years and
that too in a matter which has already been investigated thoroughly by
another Central Investigating Agency and after investigation chargesheet
has been filed and the case is pending for trial.
</p>
<p id="p_14">14.    It is pertinent to mention here that in affidavit dated 20.02.2010 filed
by Sh. K.C. Abraham, officer of respondent / Department in Crl. M.C.
5093/03, there is one letter dated 12.06.1996 of Reserve Bank of India
requesting the respondent / Department to coordinate with CBI in respect
of the investigation in the afore-noted matter. The said fact has been
concealed by the respondent in the complaint in question. Moreover, in
Snap Inspection Report of RBI annexed with the said affidavit it is
mentioned that Assistant General Manager / In-charge of concerned
Branch with Manager (IP) are squarely responsible for the remittance.
Therefore, on concealment of facts itself, the complaint and impugned
order deserve to be quashed. To strengthen his arguments ld. Counsel
have relied upon a case of MCD Vs. State of Delhi and Anr. 2005 SCC



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">Crl. M.C. Nos.3003/2002 &amp; 5093/2003                               Page 6 of 29</span>
 (Cri.) 1322, wherein it is held as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">           "21. This apart, the respondent did not also disclose the fact
           in the criminal revision filed before the High Court that he
           has also been convicted in another Criminal Case No. 202
           of 1997 by the Court of Metropolitan Magistrate, Patiala
           House, New Delhi. Thus, the contesting respondent has
           come to the High Court with unclean hands and withholds a
           vital document in order to gain advantage on the other side.
           In our opinion, he would be guilty of playing fraud on the
           Court as well as on the opposite party. A person whose
           case is based on falsehood can be summarily thrown out at
           any stage of the litigation. We have no hesitation to say that
           a person whose case is based on falsehood has no right to
           approach the court and he can be summarily thrown out at
           any stage of the litigation. In the instant case, non-
           production of the order and even non-mentioning of the
           conviction and sentence in Criminal Case No. 202 of 1997
           tantamounts to playing fraud on the Court. A litigant who
           approaches the Court is bound to produce all documents
           which are relevant to the litigation. If he withholds a vital
           document in order to gain advantage on the other side then
           he would be guilty of playing fraud on the Court as well as
           on the opposite party. The second respondent, in our
           opinion, was not justified in suppressing the material fact
           that he was convicted by the Magistrate on an earlier
           occasion. Since the second respondent deliberately
           suppressed the crucial and important fact, we disapprove
           strongly and particularly, the conduct of the second
           respondent and by reason of such conduct, the second
           respondent disentitled himself from getting any relief or
           assistance from this Court. We, however, part with this
           case with a heavy heart expressing our strong disapproval
           of the conduct and behavior but direct that the second
           respondent to pay a sum of Rs.10,000 by way of cost to the
           appellant herein."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_15">15.    Ld. Counsel further submitted that petitioner nos. 4 &amp; 5 in Crl. M.C.
</p>

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">Crl. M.C. Nos.3003/2002 &amp; 5093/2003                              Page 7 of 29</span>
<p id="p_16"> 5093/2003 have died; and petitioner nos. 1, 3, 6 &amp; 7 have retired in the
year February, 2009, 2002, April, 2011 and March, 2010 respectively.
However, their retirement benefits, i.e., gratuity, encashment of earned
leave etc. have been withheld by the Company due to the pendency of the
complaint before the Trial Court. Rest of the petitioners, i.e., petitioner
nos. 2, 8 and 9 are serving and now they are at the fag end of their service.
They have been denied of their promotions due to the pendency of the
complaint whereas their juniors have been promoted.           As such, the
petitioners are facing day-to-day humiliation due to their non-promotion
and being made accountable to their junior officers.
</p>
<p id="p_17">16.    To strengthen his arguments, ld. Senior Counsel for the petitioner
has relied upon a case of G. Sagar Suri Vs. State of Uttar Pradesh &amp; Ors.,
2000 (2) SCC 636, wherein it is held as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">          "7. It was submitted by Mr. Lalit, learned Counsel for the
          second respondent, that the appellants have already filed an
          application in the Court of Additional Judicial Magistrate

<p id="p_18">17.    On the other hand, Mr. Rajesh Manchanda, ld. Counsel appearing on
behalf of the respondent submitted that the petitioners have violated the
Procedures and Rules while signing the contract and accepting the terms of
payment and delivery of the Urea and by paying the entire amount of US$
3.80 Lakh and US$ 37.62 million respectively in advance through SBI,
New Delhi, to Pamuk Bank Ankara, Turkey and Pictet Bank, Geneva,
without prior approval bereft bank guarantee and insurance policy. The
aforesaid remittance was made by the authorized dealer, i.e, SBI, who
failed to comply with the conditions of RBI as prescribed in Paragraph 7A
(1) (d) of the Exchange Control Manual, 1993.           According to said
provisions, if any amount of advance remittance exceeds US$ 5000, a
guarantee from the International Bank of repute situated outside India
should be obtained.       Thus, the petitioners have violated the aforesaid
provisions as the specific import to India should be made within 3 months
from the date of remittance. Moreover, the importer ought to have given
an undertaking to furnish documentary evidence of import within 15 days
from the close of relevant period. The contract in question was signed in
violation of the aforesaid provisions. In addition, special permission was
also required from RBI before acquisition of payment of aforesaid foreign
exchange of US$ 3.80 Lakh and US$ 37.62 million without the same being
backed by the requisite International Bank of repute guarantee.          The
petitioners company did not obtain any permission from RBI and even the
SBI did not obtain any permission.          In this manner, the aforesaid
remittance was issued in violation of relevant provisions of FERA.

offence in collusion with other co-accused persons in a very calculative
manner which has caused loss of foreign exchange amounting to US$ 38
million to the Country. The aforesaid amount was remitted in advance in
violation of the procedure, provisions and rules by the accused persons as
the alleged Urea was not received against the said amount. Thus, the Trial
Court has legally and justifiably passed the order dated 30.05.2002 and
summoned the accused persons on the basis of violations made by them.
The investigation conducted by CBI is independent for the offences other

creates no bar to prosecute them by filing complaint under Section 56 of
FERA. No adverse inference can be drawn against the respondent for
prosecuting the petitioners and other co-accused persons, who have
committed offence in the present case.      As per law, the Company is a
juristic person and can act upon for officers responsible and liable for the
work and as such the company as well as its officers are liable to be

observed as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_8">          "4. Assailing, therefore, the statements made by each of the
          appellant under Section 67, it was vehemently contended by
          Mr. R.K.Jain, Senior Advocate that the statements on basis
          whereof the appellants have been found guilty are not
          voluntary and thus their conviction cannot be sustained. The
          statements of the appellants have been recorded by officers
          of Department of Revenue Intelligence who are not police
          officers within the meaning of <a href="/doc/494844/" id="a_30">Section 25</a> of the Evidence
          Act, 1872. The confessional statements recorded by such
          officers are admissible in evidence. Learned counsel though
          not questioning the admissibility of the said statements
          contends that the same were obtained by torture and
          harassment and are involuntary and, therefore, the
          conviction of the appellants cannot be sustained. The delay
          in recording of the statements of the appellants is put forth
          as one of the reasons to support the contention that the
          statements were involuntary. Learned counsel submits that
          after apprehending truck and the car on the road at about
          noon time on 15th May, 1993, the seizure of the narcotics
          had taken place between 6 to 9 p.m. at the Customs House

          noted that accused Nos.2, 3 and 6 were apprehended on the

          to reiterate that when an order, not interlocutory in

          after perusing the record and hearing the parties he comes
          to the conclusion, for reasons to be recorded, that there is
          not sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused The
          object of the provision which requires the Sessions Judge to

          the correctness of the reasons for which the Sessions Judge
          has held that there is or is not sufficient ground for
          proceeding against the accused. The High Court therefore is
          entitled to go into the reasons given by the Sessions Judge in

<blockquote id="blockquote_14">          In the exercise of this wholesome power, the High Court is

              justice has got to be administered according to laws made
              by the legislature. The compelling necessity for making these

 these petitioners were involved remotely in the said offence being in-
charge or responsible for the affairs of the Company and in that capacity
conspired or abetted the offence. The allegations made by the respondent
are vague and general and do not bring the petitioners under the ambit of
Section 68 of FERA, which is evident from the contents of the complaint

company, shall be deemed to be guilty of the contravention and shall be

respondent, however, without ascertaining the facts about the same,
without any documentary or other proof stated in the complaint that
accused nos. 1 to 21 be prosecuted and punished under the law being
officials of the Company and authorized agent, i.e., SBI for the offence
committed by authorized agent as they were in-charge and responsible for
the conduct of business of the petitioners company and SBI at that time.

<p id="p_35">34.    On perusal of the aforesaid provisions, it is established that
respondent failed to consider the important aspects of Section 68 of FERA
while naming the petitioners as accused without considering three
important ingredients as prescribed under Section 68 of FERA. Further
failed to bring or produce any document on record to show that all the
petitioners were in-charge and responsible for day-to-day affairs of the
Company at the time when offence was committed. Also failed to consider
the fact that the petitioners company who was made accused no. 1 in the
complaint is a Company registered under the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_38">Companies Act</a>, 1956, and is
governed by Memorandum and Articles of Association of the Company,
which are statutory and public documents and the powers and duties of
officials flow from the Articles of Association.             The respondent
deliberately did not file the said documents as the same would have


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">Crl. M.C. Nos.3003/2002 &amp; 5093/2003                               Page 19 of 29</span>
 absolved all the petitioners from the offences covered under Section 68 of
FERA. The respondent also failed to produce any document on record
showing delegated powers to any of the petitioners as in-charge and
responsible for the day-to-day affairs of the Company. Had the respondent
placed the Memorandum and Articles of Association of the Company
before the Court of ACMM, New Delhi, then the proceedings as provided
under Articles 79 and 82 of the Memorandum and Article of Association
of the Company would have pinpointed as to who were the officers in-
charge and responsible for the day-to-day affairs of the company at the
time of commission of the said offence. These facts along with documents
filed and investigation made would have made it clear that only the
Managing Director and Executive Director, namely, C.K. Ramakrishnan
and D.S. Kanwar respectively, were in-charge and responsible for the
affairs of the Company. This may be corroborated from their statements
made under Sections 39 and 40 of FERA, which are admissible in law and
the same also gets corroboration from the contents of the complaint as well
as from the investigation conducted by CBI in case No. RC-3A/96-ACU-1,
which after thorough investigation made said C.K. Ramakrishnan and D.S.
Kanwar as the accused and absolved the petitioners from any
connivance/conspiracy or abetment, however, made them as State
witnesses.
</p>
<p id="p_36">35.    The provisions of Articles 79 and 82 of the Memorandum and
Article of Association of Petitioners Company will make it explicitly clear
that only the Managing Director or the Executive Director/Functional
Directors are responsible for the conduct and management of business of



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">Crl. M.C. Nos.3003/2002 &amp; 5093/2003                           Page 20 of 29</span>

</blockquote><p id="p_37">36.      It is evident from the above that the said powers under <a href="/doc/1119830/" id="a_42">Article 79</a>
were vested only with above two persons and were not delegated to anyone
under <a href="/doc/1682669/" id="a_43">Article 82</a> as no documents in this respect has been filed in the
Court.     Moreover, the respondent has admitted in Para XIV of the
complaint that accused nos. 2 and 3 were the CMD and AD (M). The said
fact has been confirmed by CBI in the chargesheet filed by it in case RC-
3A/96-ACU-1. As per the chargesheet, the investigation has revealed that
C.K. Ramakrishnan was functioning as Managing Director and D.S.
Kanwar was functioning as Executive Director (Marketing, Personnel and
Administration) in the petitioners company during the period 1995-1996.
</p>
<p id="p_38">37.      It is not in dispute that Petitioners Company is the complainant in
the aforesaid case, whereas petitioners employees were witnesses therein.
</p>
<p id="p_39">38.      The CBI after its depth investigation, filed the chargesheet against
the aforesaid officers that they are responsible for contravention of rules
and procedure, conspiracy and misappropriation of their funds as they were
having domain over the funds of the petitioners company. Therefore, by
no stretch of imagination, it can be construed that the petitioners
committed any act making them liable under Section 68 of FERA.
</p>
<p id="p_40">39.      As per the investigation of CBI, the contract was recommended by
D.S. Kanwar on 31.10.1995 and approved by C.K. Ramakrishnan on
01.11.1995 and in terms of approved proposed contract, D.S. Kanwar gave
instructions to remit 1% of the contract value in 'Insurance Cover' which


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">Crl. M.C. Nos.3003/2002 &amp; 5093/2003                             Page 22 of 29</span>
 would show that it was only these persons who were at the helm of affairs
of the petitioners company. This fact is further proved from the contents of
Para X of the complaint that D.S. Kanwar sent a letter in the shape of
directions on 13.11.1995 to SBI for releasing 99% of the contract value to
M/s. Karsan by 14.11.1995 "positively" while the letter of petitioners
company dated 10.11.1995 signed by Deepak Lal, accused no.4 in the
complaint (since died) seeking the permission of RBI as required under the
law, to remit the contract value was still under consideration. The said fact
establishes that D.S. Kanwar, who had domain over the fund of the
company, was interested to get the remittance made under all
circumstances even without following due process as required by law.
Accordingly, the officials of SBI, the authorized agent for dealing of
remittance of foreign exchange, followed the directions of D.S. Kanwar
and effected the remittance on 14.11.1995.
</p>
<p id="p_41">40.    It is pertinent to mention here that as per the CBI, no role has been
assigned to any of the petitioners. However, by the depth investigation it is
established that the offence was committed by aforesaid two officers of the
petitioners company in connivance with other co-accused. Even otherwise,
the petitioners could not play any role in remittance and functioning of
approval of foreign exchange which was done by authorized agent, i.e.,
SBI, as appointed by the RBI. However, in case of any conspiracy in
remittance of amount, the offence may be looked into under the provisions
of Section 68 of FERA only in respect of those persons who were in-
charge and running the affairs of the Company at that time and had
colluded with certain officials of the authorized banks which were



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">Crl. M.C. Nos.3003/2002 &amp; 5093/2003                             Page 23 of 29</span>
 responsible for remittance of the foreign exchange.
</p>
<p id="p_42">41.    As per the complaint, the respondent had failed to show any
abetment on the part of the petitioners who were neither Managing
Directors, Directors, Executive Directors nor having any power or domain
over the funds nor instructed the SBI to remit the foreign exchange.
</p>
<p id="p_43">42.    On the other hand, one of the subordinate officers, namely, Deepak
Lal (since died) having equivalent position with petitioner nos. 1, 6 and 7
and was also made one of the accused by respondents, though requested
the SBI to seek permission from RBI vide his letter dated 10.11.1995 for
remittance of funds as per law, but the said request was deliberately
ignored by SBI under the directions of D.S. Kanwar, AD (Marketing), who
vide his subsequent letter dated 13.11.1995 directed the SBI to remit the
amount positively by 14.11.1995.
</p>
<p id="p_44">43.    From the facts recorded above, it is clear that petitioners are not
covered under Sub-section (ii) of Section 49 of FERA for abetting or not
complying with all or any such conditions.
</p>
<p id="p_45">44.    It is important to note that summoning order dated 30.05.2002 was
issued just two days prior to the repealing of the FERA Act as on that day
hundreds of such complaints were filed and process was to be issued in all
those complaints before 01.06.2002 when new Act in the shape of <a href="/doc/27905/" id="a_44">Foreign
Exchange Amendment Act</a>, 1999 (FEMA) was to come into force in place
of FERA, 1973. The said summoning order itself shows that the Trial
Court has not considered the aspect of criminal liability of the petitioners
under Section 68 of FERA having position of subordinate officers other


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">Crl. M.C. Nos.3003/2002 &amp; 5093/2003                            Page 24 of 29</span>
 than Managing Directors, Directors and Executive Directors as per the
provisions of Section 68 of FERA.
</p>
<p id="p_46">45.    Ld. ACMM failed to consider that vicarious liability is an exception
to the normal rule of criminal jurisprudence and no person can be held
criminally liable for the actions of another.
</p>
<p id="p_47">46.    The Supreme Court in the case of Monaben Ketanbhai Shah &amp;
Anr. Vs. State of Gujarat and Ors. (2004) 7 SCC 15 observed as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_28">          "7............The primary responsibility is on the
          complainant to make necessary averments in the
          complaint so as to make the accused vicariously
          liable. For fastening the criminal liability, there is no
          presumption that every partner knows about the
          transaction. The obligation of the appellants to prove
          that at the time the offence was committed they were
          not in charge of and were not responsible to the firm
          for the conduct of the business of the firm, would arise
          only when first the complainant makes necessary
          averments in the complaint and establishes that fact.
          The present case is of total absence of requisite
          averments in the complaint."

<p id="p_48">47.    Further in the case of <a href="/doc/1957018/" id="a_45">K.K. Ahuja Vs. V.K. Vora and Anr</a>. (2009) 10

          statement, may be sufficient for the purpose of issuing
          summons to him. But if the accused is not one of the
          persons who falls under the category of 'persons who

</blockquote>
<p id="p_49">48.    It is pertinent to mention here that in Para 4 (xiv) of the complaint, it
is stated that while effecting the advance remittance, the SBI failed to
comply with the conditions prescribed by RBI as laid down in Para 7A
(10)(d) of the Exchange Control Manual, 1993, wherein if any amount of
advance remittance exceeds US$ 5000, a guarantee from the International
Bank of repute situated outside India should be obtained. Further stated,
special permission was required to be obtained from RBI before
acquisition and payment of the above said foreign exchange. Therefore,
major role has been attributed to SBI and the only role attributed to the

 petitioners employees is under the provisions of FERA for which all the
documents and investigations lead to the conclusion pointing out the role
of C.K. Ramakrishnan and D.S. Kanwar who acted upon without having
any resolution, passed by the Board of Directors of petitioner company, in
their favour.
</p>
<p id="p_50">49.    It is not out of place to mention here that RBI in its letter dated
12.06.1996 requested the respondent on the lines that "since the matter is
already under investigation of CBI, we request you to kindly coordinate
with them." Further, vide its letter dated 13.06.1996, RBI handed over the
Snap Inspection Report dated 27.05.1996 and also other relevant papers to
CBI in this regard. The Snap Inspection Report held the SBI responsible
for remittance. However, it is nowhere mentioned therein that any of the
petitioners had played any role in the remittance.
</p>
<p id="p_51">50.    As per Section 2(b) of FERA, SBI is the 'authorized' dealer to deal
in all foreign currencies as provided under <a href="/doc/1639853/" id="a_51">Section 6</a> (2) (ii) of FERA. As
provided under <a href="/doc/1639853/" id="a_52">Section 6</a> (4) of FERA, the SBI in all its dealings in foreign
exchange and in the exercise and discharge of powers and of the functions
delegated to it under Section 74 of FERA complied with such general or
special directions or instructions as the RBI made from time to time.
Moreover, without the permission of the Reserve Bank, an authorized
dealer shall not engage in any transaction involving any foreign exchange
which is not in conformity with the terms of the authorization under this
Section.
</p>
<p id="p_52">51.    It is important to note that the respondent had admitted in Para 4 of



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">Crl. M.C. Nos.3003/2002 &amp; 5093/2003                            Page 27 of 29</span>
 the complaint that instructions were given by PMO to accused C.K.
Ramakrishnan, Managing Director of the petitioners company by calling
him in the PMO to help accused Sanjeeva Rao, the relative of the then
Prime Minister. The said averments of the complaint shows that the said
contract was being dealt with at the highest level, i.e., at the level of the
then Prime Minister as his relative Sanjeeva Rao kept on meeting accused
C.K. Ramakrishnan between April to October, 1995 due to same, a
contract was signed in July, 1995, which was not acted upon in its place.
Therefore, another contract was signed on 09.11.1995. This fact has been
corroborated with the statements of C.K. Ramakrishnan and D.S. Kanwar
recorded under Section 40 of FERA.
</p>
<p id="p_53">52.    In view of the facts recorded above, it is apparently clear that the
respondents deliberately and willfully ignored the investigation conducted
by CBI whereby, chargesheet at Para 2 confirmed that C.K. Ramakrishnan
and D.S. Kanwar who were functioning as Managing Director and
Executive Director respectively in the petitioners company were
responsible having domain over the funds of the company during the year
1995-96 and they dishonestly in connivance with officials of M/s. Karsan
Limited, a Turkish Company and other accused persons, directed the bank
officers to remit US$ 38 million to the account of M/s. Karsan Limited.
Moreover, the facts of the investigation have been concealed by the
respondent before the Trial Court and since the sunset period was expired,
therefore, hurriedly without going through the material on record, the Trial
Court had issued the summons against the petitioners.
</p>
<p id="p_54">53.    It is further important to note that vide order dated 03.10.2002 and
