                          JUDGMENT
</pre><p id="p_1">     This is a suit for ejectment, arrears of rent and for
damages.
</p>
<p id="p_2">     2.    Suit schedule property is shop No.1 of property
No.2095,   5th   Main,   9th   Cross,   2nd   Stage,   Vijayanagar,
Bengaluru-560040, measuring 10x15 feet, bounded by:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">                  East- road
                  West- shop No.3 and house
                  North- house property
                  South- shop No.2

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">     3.    The summary of the plaint averments is that, the
plaintiffs are the absolute owners of property bearing No.
2095, 5th Main, 9th Cross, 2nd Stage, Vijayanagar, Bengaluru,
consisting of residential portion and three shops. That
plaintiffs let out the schedule shop on rental basis to the
defendant under rental agreement dated 10.01.2015 for a
period of 11 months on rent of Rs.13,000/- per month and
Rs.1,25,000/- as security deposit. During subsistence of the
said lease period the defendant approached and expressed his
intention to do tyre business and requested for some more
accommodation.      Accordingly by providing the vacant space
available there a new rent agreement was entered into on
29.09.2015 on a condition that the defendant has to pay rent
of Rs.22,000/- per month as the dimension of the shop was
increased. Even the said agreement was also for a period of
11 months.       After entering into new lease agreement the
defendant paid rent for the month of October-2015 only and
                                       3                 O.S.5059/2017
thereafter he committed default and did not pay the rent.
</blockquote><p id="p_3">Instead he sent a legal notice on 18.12.2015 making false
allegations against the plaintiffs.       It was suitably replied by
the plaintiffs on 22.01.2016.   Thereafter the defendant filed
O.S No.165/2016 for permanent injunction against these
plaintiffs making baseless allegations against them. Since he
had not paid rent from November-2015 onwards and also as
he unnecessarily dragged the plaintiffs in litigation, the
plaintiffs issued legal notice on 16.02.2017 terminating his
tenancy with effect from 15.03.2017.           The said notice was
sent to the schedule premises and also to his residential
address. Notice sent to the schedule shop was duly served on
him, whereas the notice sent to his residential address was
returned with postal shara as 'no such person available'. It
revealed that intentionally he avoided the termination notice.
Due to non-payment of rent from November-2015 to August-
2016 i.e for a period of 10 months he is in arrears of rent of
Rs.2,20,000/-.   Wherefore plaintiffs pray for Judgment and
Decree of ejectment; to direct him to pay arrears of rent from
October-2015 to August-2016 for ten months quantified at
Rs.2,20,000/-; and for damages from September-2016 till
possession is handed over.
</p>
<p id="p_4">      4.   The defendant appeared and filed his written
statement admitting that plaintiffs are the absolute owners of
the property bearing No.2095 of Vijayanagar. He also
admitted that he took the schedule premises on rent of
Rs.13,000/- under agreement dated 10.01.2015 and the said
rent agreement was of English calendar month.               He also
                                    4                O.S.5059/2017
admitted that he has paid Rs.1,25,000/- as security deposit.
However he denied that he was not paying the rent regularly
and has not paid rent from November-2015 onwards. He also
stoutly denied that during the currency of the rental
agreement dated 10.01.2015 he entered into another rentl
agreement on 29.09.2015, agreeing to pay rent of Rs.22,000/-
per month and for the purpose of his tyre business the
dimension of the schedule shop was increased.        In turn he
alleged that during the lease agreement dated 10.01.2015 all
of a sudden the plaintiffs came and demanded to enhance the
rent at Rs.20,000/-, that too even before expiry of the initial
period of 11 months and when it was declined by him, they
tried to dispossess him, however at the intervention of elderly
persons of the locality matter was settled and he agreed to
pay the enhanced rent at 10% per annum on existing rent of
Rs.13,000/- per month, but after expiry of the rental
agreement dated 10.01.2015.      Having not satisfied with the
said assurance of the defendant, on one day at about 7 pm
the plaintiffs came along with their men and forcibly took his
signatures on a stamp paper without disclosing its contents.
Since the defendant was also busy in his business, under
pressure he signed the stamp papers without going through
their contents. But later he came to know that it was a new
rental agreement, whereunder he allegedly agreed to pay the
rent at Rs.22,000/- per month.      As there was no voluntary
act on the part of the defendant and as the said document is
an outcome of force, in order to protect his possession he filed
suit at O.S.165/2016 for permanent injunction. Subsequent
to filing of that suit the plaintiffs have come up with this suit
                                             5                    O.S.5059/2017
making false and frivolous allegations against him. There is
no cause of action for the suit and the alleged one is false and
invented. It is denied that plaintiff issued termination notice
and there is a valid and proper termination of tenancy. Thus
on these grounds and other grounds the defendant prays to
dismiss the suit with cost.
</p>
<p id="p_5">      5.   Based on the said pleadings, I have framed the
following issues.
</p><p id="p_6">                                      ISSUES
</p><p id="p_7">               1)     Whether the plaintiffs prove that the
                      defendant is in arrears of rent from
                      October 2015 to August 2016 at the
                      rate of Rs.22000/- p.m.?
</p>
<p id="p_8">               2)     Whether the plaintiffs prove the valid
                      termination of tenancy?</p><pre id="pre_2">

               3)     Whether the plaintiffs are entitled for
                      the   reliefs    of       eviction   and     for
                      damages?

               4)     What order or decree?




</pre><p id="p_9">      6.   In support of their case plaintiffs examined
plaintiff No.1 as PW.1 and got marked 16 documents. On the
other hand having taken his own time at every stage of the
proceedings,        right   from   the      inception,     the     defendant
examined himself as DW.1 and no document is marked on his
behalf.
</p><p id="p_10">                                   6                  O.S.5059/2017


</p><p id="p_11">     7.    I have heard the arguments of Sri NM Advocate for
the plaintiffs. No argument was addressed by the defendant
nor he tendered his written arguments even after providing
opportunity for the same. Perused the case file.
</p>
<p id="p_12">     8.    My findings on the above issues are as under:
</p><pre id="pre_3">            Issue No.1:         In the affirmative

            Issue No.2:         In the affirmative

            Issue No.3:         In the affirmative

            Issue No.4:         As per final order below,
                                for the following:


                          REASONS

</pre><p id="p_13">     9.    ISSUE No.1 TO 3: Since these issues are some-
what interwoven and there is no considerable controversy
between the parties, in order to avoid possible overlapping of
discussion, I have taken all these issues simultaneously.
</p>
<p id="p_14">     10.   As I pointed out earlier, in para-2 of his written
statement the defendant conceded the contents of para-3 of
the plaint, whereunder the plaintiffs submitted that they are
the absolute owners of property bearing No.2095, 5th Main,
9th Cross, 2nd Stage, Vijayanagar, Bengaluru-560040. Despite
such written admission of the defendant with abundant
caution plaintiffs produced attested copy of sale deed dated
07.09.2004, executed by Smt.Rathna Basavarajendrappa in
their favour, alienating the said property for consideration of
Rs.40,62,000/-at Ex.P.13. In the schedule to that sale deed
                                    7                 O.S.5059/2017
property has been described. Ex.P.14 is the BBMP tax paid
receipt for the year 2017-18. Ex.P.15 and P.16 are the
notarized attested photo copies of BBMP Khata Certificate
and khata extract and they reveal that pursuant to the
Ex.P.13 khata of the property No.2095 has been made in the
names of plaintiffs and they are the owners and khatedars of
the said property.
</p>
<p id="p_15">      11.   In the cross examination of PW.1 the defendant
elicited that the said property consists of a residential portion
and three shops in the ground floor.         From the written
statement it is clear that the defendant is not disputing the
rental agreement dated 10.01.2015, marked as Ex.P.1. He
admits that he took the shop premises from these plaintiffs
on   a   rent   of   Rs.13,000/-   and    security   deposit    of
Rs.1,25,000/- for a period of 11 months. However he denied
the execution of second rental agreement dated 29.09.2015
marked as Ex.P.2. As per the plaintiffs they entered into the
said subsequent rental agreement at the instance of the
defendant when he requested for more accommodation to do
tyre business and they also contended that the subsequent
rental agreement was entered during the currency of the
Ex.P.1 itself. Whereas the defendant submits that one day in
the evening at 7 pm when he was busy in his business
forcibly and illegally his signatures were obtained by the
plaintiffs on stamp papers, without explaining him about the
contents and later he realized that it is rental agreement
containing a    stipulation that    he   has to pay rent        of
                                     8                O.S.5059/2017
Rs.22,000/- per month. Thus he disputes the genuinety of
Ex.P.2 in tooth and nail.
</p>
<p id="p_16">      12.   In this background if one were to look at the cross
examination    of   DW.1,   vis-à-vis   his   pleadings and    his
examination-in-chief one thing is crystal clear that nowhere
he either pleaded or adduced evidence to show as to on which
day the plaintiffs had come along with their men and forcibly
took his signatures on Ex.P.2.      On page No.5 of his cross
exam he could not say on which day his signatures were
forcibly obtained on Ex.P.2 and it was elicited that he has not
filed any complaint for such an alleged illegal act of plaintiffs
nor he issued legal notices to them immediately. This itself
shows that his so called defence of concoction of Ex.P.2 is a
after-thought story. I would substantiate this with his cross
examination recorded in para-3 on 25.09.2018. On that day
admitting his signatures on Ex.P.1 and P.2 and after their
distinct marking as Ex.P.1(a) and Ex.P.2(a), when further
suggestion was put to him that he made these signatures in
presence of the witnesses, he admitted the same. This itself
rules out his contention that his signature on Ex.P.2 was
forcibly obtained and he did not agree for new rent agreement
during the subsistence of Ex.P.1. It may be noted that in that
very para-3 of his cross exam dated 25.09.2018 he conceded
that in front of the shop leased to him some vacant space was
available and he is doing the tyre business there by keeping
them in front of the schedule shop.       It further adds to the
contention of the plaintiffs that for the sake of tyre business
only, during the subsistence of Ex.P.1 the Ex.P.2 was came to
                                      9                 O.S.5059/2017
be entered into and rent was increased from Rs.13,000/- to
Rs.22,000/-.
</p>
<p id="p_17">       13.   Plaintiffs have produced copy of the legal notice
dated 18.12.2015, issued by the defendant, calling upon
them to hand over the Ex.P.2, at Ex.P.12. In that notice also
at para-4 he alleged that the plaintiffs forcibly took his
signature at 7 pm coming along with anti-social elements,
again without disclosing the day on which the said incident
happened. Therefore one cannot believe the Ex.P.12 and its
contents. If this finding is arrived there is no reason to
discard the Ex.P.2, the second rental agreement dated
29.09.2015, under which again parties agreed to let out and
take   the   schedule   shop   for   a   period   of   11   months
commencing from the date of that agreement and it was
agreed that Rs.1,25,000/- paid already shall be continued to
be treated as security deposit and this defendant has to pay
Rs.22,000/- rent per month. So the evidence of PW.1 is
substantially corroborated by the cross examination of DW.1
and the documents produced by the plaintiffs.
</p>
<p id="p_18">       14.   The very fact that this defendant did not reply the
termination notice dated 16.02.2017 marked as Ex.P.7 having
received it at the schedule shop, as evidenced by Ex.P.10,
would further strengthen the plaintiffs' case. Nonetheless in
para-10 of his written statement the defendant half-heartedly
contended that no notice was sent to him by the plaintiffs,
but in the cross examination he admitted his residential
address as shown in Ex.P.1 and P.2 and also as described in
                                    10                O.S.5059/2017
the cause title. This itself shows that he is not a man of truth.
The postal acknowledgement produced at Ex.P.10 affirms that
the termination notice was duly served on him viz at the
schedule shop address. So even if it is not served on his
residential address, it makes no difference. It is also
important to note that prior to issuing of Ex.P.7 the plaintiffs
had issued reply notice on 22.01.2016 as per Ex.P.3, when he
called upon them to hand over the Ex.P.2 through Ex.P.12.
With regard to service of Ex.P.3 there is no specific denial by
him, which in reply to the Ex.P.12. If at all he had not
voluntarily put his signatures to Ex.P.2 and it was got
executed forcibly and against his wish he ought to have sent
a rejoinder notice to Ex.P.3. It may be noted that in Ex.P.3
the plaintiffs have extensively stated regarding the Ex.P.2. So
again and again I hold that Ex.P.2 is a genuine document and
this defendant for the sake of expansion of his business
utilized the adjacent open space of the schedule shop and he
is enjoying that property even now.

<p id="p_19">      15.   If the above conclusion is arrived then what
remains is, the arrears of rent. I think in so far as this aspect
is concerned there is no considerable controversy. In his
written statement at para-3 making a sweeping allegation
that averments made in para-4 to 12 of the plaint are false
and concocted and again in para-5 that he was prompt in
payment of rent, no specific assertion was made him by
stating that he has paid the rent at least at admitted rate
regularly. Added to that in his cross examination on page
No.3 at para-2 he squarely admitted that he has not paid rent
                                   11              O.S.5059/2017
from November-2015.     He conceded that October-2015 was
the last payment that he made. Even he also admitted that
he did not send notice to the plaintiffs to receive the rent
when they refused to accept it. So his contention that they
did not receive rent from him is baseless and unfounded.
Since by October-2015 the Ex.P.2 was already executed he
was liable to pay Rs.22,000/- rent per month. If he has not
paid rent from November-2015, till the termination of tenancy
he was expected to pay the rent at that rate.         In this
background if Ex.P.7 is gone through, at para-5 of that notice
and in the final paragraph expressing their intention to
terminate his tenancy in unequivocal words, the plaintiffs
communicated that they have terminated his tenancy and
directed him to quit, vacate and hand over vacant possession
by 15.03.2017. The said period of more than 15 days from
the date of service of notice being in excess of the period
prescribed in <a href="/doc/80042/" id="a_1">section 106</a> of T.P.Act tenancy was validly
terminated with effect from 15.03.2017. So the defendant is
liable to pay arrears of rent from November-2015 to
15.03.2017 i.e for a period of 16½ months and not for 10
months as calculated by the plaintiffs.   In that case at the
rate of Rs.22,000/- per month the arrears of rent for the said
16½ months would be Rs.3,63,000/-. As the said amount is
not paid by the defendant, he is liable to pay the same within
a stipulated time, failing which he has to pay the same with
interest @ 12% p.a till its complete payment.

<p id="p_20">     16.   The plaintiffs have prayed for damages from
September-2016. However in view of my discussion made in
                                    12               O.S.5059/2017
the foregoing paragraphs it is not from September-2016, but
from 16.03.2017 they are entitled for damages till possession
is restored to them. Instead driving the parties for one more
round of litigation as held in the decision reported at AIR
2013 ANDHRA PRADESH 7 (<a href="/doc/122088987/" id="a_2">Alok Kumar Sharma /vs/
Smt. T.Hemalatha</a>) in this case itself court can quantify the
rate of damages. In that case at Head Note-B Hon'ble High
Court of Andhra Pradesh held that in the original proceedings
itself if there is sufficient material trial court can determine
the mesne profits and while deciding that amount it has to
take into account the existing rent and rising rend in rental
values. Moreover while determining the damages court has to
take into account the legal expenses incurred by the landlord
and also the pain he undergoes to recover his own property
and the trauma he faces.        Apart from that, if the rate of
damages is fixed at the agreed rate of rent, it is nothing but
benefiting the litigant-tenant, who is on the wrong track. So I
feel that fixing of rate of damages at Rs.25,000/- per month
would meet the ends of justice. If this finding is arrived, then
defendant is liable to pay damages at the rate of Rs.25,000/-
per month from 16.03.2017 till possession is restored with a
clause to enhance the same at 10% at the end of every two
years till the possession is restored.   If the said amount of
damages calculated till the end of this month it would come
to Rs.4,87,500/-. So with this I answer these issues in the
affirmative.
