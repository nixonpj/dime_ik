ORAL ORDER</pre> 

 

<p id="p_1">(Per
: HONOURABLE MR.JUSTICE V. M. SAHAI)
 

</p><p id="p_2">1.	We
have heard Mr.Y.F.Mehta, learned counsel for the appellant and
Mr.Paresh Upadhyay, learned counsel for the respondent.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_3">2.	This
Letters Patent Appeal has been filed, challenging the judgment and
order of the learned Single Judge dated 20.7.2010, by which, the writ
petition filed by the respondent has been allowed by the learned
Single Judge.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_4">3.	The
facts of the case in brief are that, the respondent was working as a
Senior Clerk with the appellant. On 1.8.2006, he tendered an
application requesting the appellant for voluntary retirement and his
request was to be made it effective from 3.10.2006.  While
considering and scrutinizing the application for voluntary
retirement, it appears that the appellant detected that incorrect
date of birth of the respondent had been mentioned in is service book
as 16.11.1949 though as per the School Leaving Certificate, mentioned
his date of birth was 18.9.1946.  The appellant issued a notice to
the respondent, to which, he submitted the reply and submitted a copy
of his Passport bearing his date of birth as 16.11.1949.  Thereafter,
the appellant passed an order on 29.6.2007 compulsorily retiring the
respondent.  
</p>
 

 


 

<p id="p_5">4.	The
learned Single Judge has allowed the writ petition of the respondent
on the ground that with regard to correction of his date of birth in
his service book, no departmental proceedings had been contemplated
as per Gujarat Civil Services (Discipline and Appeal) Rules, 1971 by
the appellant against the respondent. Therefore, order of compulsory
retirement, illegal and in violation of principles of natural
justice. 
</p>
 

 


 

<p id="p_6">5.	We
are in complete agreement with the view taken by the learned Single
Judge that if the appellant wanted to change or alter date of birth
recorded in the service book of the respondent, in that case,
departmental proceedings under the aforesaid Rules ought to have been
initiated against the respondent. But the appellant could not
compulsorily retire the retirement without holding any departmental
proceedings, against the respondent when the discrepancy in the date
of birth was detected by the appellant while considering the
application for voluntary retirement, at the fag end of the service.
In this view of the matter, we do not find any merit in this appeal.
This appeal fails and is summarily dismissed.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_7">6.	In
view of the order passed in the main appeal, no orders are required
to be passed on the Civil Application  for stay and it is also
dismissed.</p><pre id="pre_2">
