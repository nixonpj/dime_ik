 ORAL JUDGMENT</pre>
 


 


 


<p id="p_1">		Heard
learned advocate Mr. Saurabh Mehta for the applicants and Ld. APP Mr.
NJ Shah for the respondent no. 1   State. Respondent no. 2 though
served, has not appeared.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_2">2		This petition under
<a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_1">section 482</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure, hereinafter referred
to as  the Cr. P.C.  is filed to quash and set aside the order
dated 26/2/2008 passed in Criminal Inquiry Case No. 45/2008 directing
the Satellite Police Station to investigate the complaint under
<a href="/doc/1291024/" id="a_2">section 156</a>[3] of the Cr. P.C and thereby to quash and set aside M.
Case No. 14/2008 filed at Satellite Police Station in pursuance of
the above referred order dated 26/2/2008. In the result, the prayer
in the petition is to quash and set aside the above complaint filed
by respondent no. 2 before the Court of Judicial Magistrate First
Class, Ahmedabad [Rural] under <a href="/doc/770961/" id="a_3">sections 323</a>, <a href="/doc/1090821/" id="a_4">392</a>, <a href="/doc/1289794/" id="a_5">452</a>, <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_6">504</a>, <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_7">506</a> [2]
and 114<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_8"> of the Indian Penal Code</a> [<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_9">IPC</a>].
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_3">3		Perused
the record. As argued by the learned advocate for the applicants, the
applicants are relatives, family members and friends of in-laws of
the complainant   respondent no. 2. It is not disputed fact that
wife of the brother of the complainant, namely Nandini being daughter
of applicant no. 1 and wife of Sureshbhai Dharamdas Bajaj being
brother of the respondent no. 2, has filed Criminal Case No. 350/2006
against her in-laws including the present respondent no. 2 Pavan
Bajaj under <a href="/doc/1868826/" id="a_10">sections 498</a>[A], 506[2], 294[B] and 114 of the <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_11">IPC</a>
alleging that they all were demanding dowry and harassing with
physical and mental torture to her.  One another complaint was also
filed by said Nandini, daughter of the present applicant no. 1 under
the <a href="/doc/542601/" id="a_12">Domestic Violence Act</a> before the Metropolitan Magistrate s
Court, Ahmedabad, for the mis-deed and crimes committed by the
respondent no. 2 and his family members; on 11/12/2007. Copies of
both such complaints are on record at Annexures B and C respectively,
wherein  there are specific and multiple allegations regarding
misdeeds and crimes committed by the present respondent no. 2 and his
family members being in-laws of Nandini.  The chronology of all these
complaints makes it clear that the first complaint was filed by
Nandini in the year 2006, second complaint in the year 2007 and the
third complaint, which is subject matter of the present petition, is
filed by one of the accused of her complaints on 26/2/2008.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_4">4		From
the record, it transpires that Nandini, daughter of the applicant
nos. 1 and 2, married with brother of the respondent no. 2, namely 
Sureshbhai Bajaj on 28/11/2005 and within a month i.e. on 12/1/2006
Nandini has to file a complaint under <a href="/doc/542601/" id="a_13">sections 498-A</a>, etc. of the <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_14">IPC</a>
and thereafter she was driven out from the house of her in-laws. It
also transpires that the dispute continued upto 26/2/2008 when
complaint under the <a href="/doc/542601/" id="a_15">Domestic Violence Act</a> was filed.  Whereas
in the Criminal Case No. 45/2008 present respondent no. 2 has stated
that in fact they had compromised the dispute by returning all the
valuable things as well as Rs.55,000/- in cash to the lady and
accordingly she has to withdraw all the complaints, but the lady and
her family members being present applicants showed greediness and
claimed Rs.2 lac for divorce and withdrawal of all the cases. It is
further alleged that since the respondent no. 2 and his family
members were not able to fulfill the demands of the lady and her
family members, they i.e. present applicants, had rushed to the house
of the respondent no.  2 on 24/2/2008 and started quarrel demanding
Rs.2 lac for divorce, beaten him and his wife as well as snatched
away golden chain and damaged the household articles. It is further
stated in such complaint that due to such incident, neighbours had
gathered and thereupon the applicants had run away with a threat that
if Rs.2 lac are not paid for divorce within 8 days, then they will
kill entire family of the respondent no. 2.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_5">5		Therefore,
things are clear that there are at-least two complaints by the wife
for demand of dowry and for physical as well as mental torture and
thereafter the present complaint is filed by brother of the husband
of such lady, mainly as a counter blast against all such previous
litigations. If we peruse the complaint,
it becomes clear that the complainant - respondent no. 2 has
concocted story of incident only with a view to file complaint
against present applicants so as to pressurize them to settle the
complaint where the respondent no. 2 is accused. The most surprising
disclosure by the respondent no. 2 in para 5 of the complaint is that
after the incident, he had been to Satellite Police Station to lodge
a complaint, where the officers present at the relevant time had
advised him to file a complaint in the Court and denied or refused to
accept his complaint considering ongoing dispute between the parties.
Therefore, after two days from the date of incident i.e. 26/2/2008 a
complaint was filed before the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Ahmedabad
[Rural] and requested the Court to forward the complaint to the
police station for further investigation. However, the respondent no.
2 could not disclose the name of any outsider, neighbour or third
person as a witness, whereas in addition to himself, other two
witnesses are named as his brother and his own wife.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_6">6		In
his complaint, the respondent no. 2 has disclosed his address as
 Deep Tower, Near Atithi Hotel, Bodakdev, Satellite, Ahmedabad 
and the same address is disclosed by the lady Nandini in her
complaint at Annexure-B. However, the respondent no. 2 has failed to
realize that he could not disclose the full name of applicant no. 2
even in complaint and that address of applicant was disclosed as
 Saijpur Bogha, Ahmedabad . Whereas witness and brother of the
respondent no. 2, who is husband of lady Nandini, namely Suresh
Dharamdas Bajaj is residing at Dwarkesh Tower, behind Nidhi Complex,
Judges Bungalow, Bodakdev, and not with the respondent no. 2 in Deep
Tower, near Atithi Hotel, Bodakdev. Though these places are not at
far distance, the fact remains that only with a view to disclose
their names as witnesses, the respondent no. 2 has in his complaint
stated that at about 7.0 PM on 24/2/2008 his brother Sureshbhai was
also at his house when present applicants intruded his house at the
time of incident. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_7">7		Therefore, the record
shows that practically, this complaint under reference being Criminal
Case No. 45/2008 is filed by the respondent no. 2 is nothing but
counter blast against the complaints filed by the wife of his
brother, namely Nandini against her in-laws, including respondent no.
</p><p id="p_8">2. Even the allegations   in the complaint are of such nature which
confirm that the complaint is filed only with a view to harass the
applicants or to pressurize them to withdraw the complaints filed by
Nandini.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_9">8		Probably
knowing such position, the respondent no. 2 original complainant has
chosen to stay away from this proceedings even after service
of notice, knowing fully well that there is interim order dated
9/5/2008 in favour of the applicants
 


 


 


9		Though it would not
be impossible, it would be difficult to believe that the applicants
who are residing at distant place than the residence of the
respondent no. 2, would rush to the applicants  house only for
giving a threat or for slapping or for fist blows and for demanding
Rs.2 lac. If at all other neighbours have gathered at the relevant
time, as stated in the complaint itself, the respondent no. 2,
complainant could have certainly disclosed them as witnesses in the
complaint itself. In view of the above facts and circumstances and
relying upon the settled legal position that criminal proceedings
could not be entertained only with a view to harass somebody and more
particularly any complaint like present, when it is filed as a
counter blast of the complaints filed by the victim of domestic
violence and claim of dowry, such proceedings cannot be allowed to
continue. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_10">10		Thereby the petition
deserves to be allowed by quashing the complaint and pending
investigation against the present applicants.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_11">11		Though
the discussion, opinion and determination in this judgment is in
favour of the present applicants after narrating the factual
details in foregoing paragraphs, it is necessary to make it clear
that all such observations and discussion is limited only for
deciding propriety and necessity of the  investigation of Criminal
Case No. 45/2008 as filed by the respondent no. 2. Thereby it is made
clear that any such observation or finding shall not come in the way
of the competent authority i.e. investigating agency and Criminal
Courts, where complaints filed by lady Nandini are pending. Thereby
these authorities have to decide the matters pending before them
absolutely without being influenced by the present order in any
manner and strictly in accordance with law.  The details with
reference to the activity by Satellite Police Station so far as it
relates to extending advice to the respondent no. 2 original
complainant to file complaint before the Court is concerned, even if
I do not take serious steps on such count, there is no option but to
observe that all such activities by the investigating agency are not
proper and to that extent the State Authorities are required to take
appropriate steps.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_12">12		In
view of the above facts, circumstances, details and discussion, the
petition deserves to be allowed. Therefore, the petition is allowed.
Thereby the Criminal Case No. 45/2008 filed on  26/2/2008 by  the
respondent no. 2   complainant, which is pending before
the Judicial Magistrate First Class, Ahmedabad [Rural] and
investigation in the form of M. Case No. 14/2008 before Satellite
Police Station initiated from such complaint are hereby quashed and
set aside.  Rule made absolute accordingly.
