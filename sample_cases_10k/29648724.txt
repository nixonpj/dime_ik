It is evident in the complaint, that on 05.09.2018, one

Smt. Shankaremma said to be the second wife of

Basawaraj Hodal had lodged a complaint before the

respondent police alleging that her husband- Basawaraj
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                  3</span>




Hodal was working as Manager of Taluka Agricultural

Produce    Co-operative         Marketing         Societies.   Said

Basawaraj Hodal married three wives, but no issues

from all of his wives.     On 05.09.2018 at about 7.30

a.m., the husband of the complainant Basawaraj Hodal

went to his land in order to hand over the pesticide to

the agricultural labourer for spraying the same to the

toor dall crops.     At about, 10.30 a.m., complainant

received   a   phone     call        from   one     Shivaraj   S/o

Nagendrappa Mali Patil that her husband Basawaraj

Hodal was murdered by unknown person by assaulting

him by means of deadly weapons. Soon after getting the

information about the incident, herself along with other

two wives of the deceased Basawaraj Hodal went to the

place where the dead body of the Basawaraj Hodal was

lying by sustaining injuries on the head, right eye and

other parts of the body. It is further stated that the

accused and another person by name Subhash were

present there.     In pursuance of the act committed by
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                 4</span>




the accused, complainant filed a complaint against the

unknown persons relating to committing murder of her

husband Basawaraj Hodal. Subsequent, to registration

of   the     crime   in     Crime         No.277/2018,      the

petitioner/accused has been apprehended by the police

and remanded to judicial custody on 24.09.2018.

During the custody, accused has given confessional

statement before C.W.6-Manik S/o Subhash.                   The

Investigation Officer has investigated the case and laid

the charge sheet against the accused after conducting

thorough investigation which inclusive of drawing of

spot mahazar and seizure of articles.

<p id="p_5">
</p><p id="p_6">4.   The learned counsel for the accused who has

taken   me    through     the       averments   made   in   the

complaint, filed by the complainant-Smt. Shankaremma

said to be the second wife of the deceased Basawaraj

Hodal. The deceased had three wives, but there are no

issues from all of them. The incident was taken place on
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                               5</span>




05.09.2018 at about 7.30 a.m., the husband of the

complainant had been to the land in order to hand over

pesticide for the purpose of spraying the same to the

tur-dall.       Thereafter,       the   complainant-Smt.

Shankaremma received a phone call from one Shivaraj

who stated her that her husband was murdered by

unknown person. The petitioner/ accused is said to be

the labourer working in the land of the deceased

Basawaraj Hodal and another by name Subhash were

present. Even though they were present, she had given

complaint only against the          unknown said   to be

committed the murder of her husband Basawaraj

Hodal.      Therefore, the crime came to be registered by

the police against the unknown person. Based on the

confessional statement said to have been given by the

accused before the C.W.6-Manik, the petitioner/accused

has been apprehended by the police and thereafter he

had been remanded to judicial custody on 24.09.2018.

But, there is no direct over-tact attributed against this
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                            6</span>




accused for having committed the murder of the

deceased Basawaraj Hodal. The deceased who had made

luring in having some illicit relationship with the

Sangeeta said to be the wife of the accused as the

deceased who called her to the places in the land and in

the terms of talking with her, the same has been

objected by this accused said to be the husband of the

Sangeeta. Therefore, there was some enmity developed

in between the accused and the deceased.       That, on

05.09.2018 in between 8.30 a.m to 9.30 a.m. the

incident was taken place and the same has been

reflected in the supplementary statement given by the

complainant-Smt. Shankremma said to be the second

wife of the deceased Basawaraj Hodal.    The same has

been recorded by the police on 24.09.2018, but incident

had taken place on 05.09.2018.      He further submits

that, there is no direct ovetract attributed against the

accused, who said to have been committed the murder

of the deceased by assaulting by means of club and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                             7</span>




stone. He further submits that P.W.6 Manik said to be

the eyewitness given a statement before the police

wherein he has stated that the accused had given extra

judicial confession before      him saying as he     has

committed the murder of the deceased Basawaraj

Hodal. In the statement, it is revealed that the deceased

said to be lured his wife-Sangeeta.   Therefore, he had

suspected the activities of Basawaraj Hodal and for that

reason only, he has to take a revenge to finish him. As

such, on 05.09.2018 at about 8.00 a.m. the deceased

Basawaraj Hodal had been to the land for the purpose

of handing over pesticide for spraying the same to the

tur-dall crops and he was murdered.         This is the

statement given by C.W.6-Manik, wherein in para No.2

of his statement is relating to the extra judicial

confessional made by the accused before him that they

took arrack bottle and consumed the same at a little

distance of the village Aurad by the side of the road.

That petitioner who has confessed the incident about
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                   8</span>




the murder of Basawaraj Hodal before him (C.W.6) as on

intoxication mood that this accused had given his extra

judicial confession before him. Therefore, his statement

has been recorded by the investigation officer on

09.09.2018.     It is further contended that one C.W.7-

Yeshwant said to have given a statement before the

investigation officer as he being one of the eyewitnesses

to the incident that on 05.09.2018 at about 9.00 a.m.

when he was proceeding from his village and while he

was proceeding, he heard the screaming sound from the

low lying area nearby the land of Basawaraj Hodal the

accused   was    said     to    be    assaulted   the   deceased

Basawaraj Hodal by means of club and stones. But, he

did not specifically stated in his statement said to be

recorded by the Investigation Officer and to what

distance he has seen the incident and how the accused

said to be assaulted the deceased by means of club and

also using sized stone said to be seized by the

investigation   officer        during   the   course     of   the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                   9</span>




investigation.     He   further       submits   that    the   entire

prosecution is relied upon the statement, mainly of one

C.W.6-Manik, before whom accused is said to have

given extra confessional statement about the incident

and also before the C.W.7-Yeshawant said to be the

eyewitness for having seen the incident that this

accused assaulted the deceased by means of club and

also using sized stone. But, there is no direct over-tact

attributed against this accused for having committed

the murder of the deceased and there was no enmity

between      the   deceased   Basawaraj         Hodal    and    the

accused. But, the accused used to work in the land of

the deceased as a labourer. There are no materials

relating to the illicit relationship between the deceased

with Sangeeta, the wife of the accused. But, the entire

case is rest upon the circumstantial evidence and also

suspicion.     Therefore, the learned counsel, who has

emphatically contended that except these materials,

there is no strong material have been secured by the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                  10</span>




Investigation        Officer   during    the   course    of    the

investigation. Mere because laying the charge sheet

against the accused it cannot be said that the accused

has to be declined to granting the bail. The accused who

hails from the respectable family and also having

respect in the eye of the society and moreover the

accused is ready to abide by any terms and conditions

to be imposed by this Court while granting bail to him.

Therefore,     the     learned   counsel     appearing   for   the

petitioner prays for enlarging the petitioner on regular

bail.

<p id="p_7">5.      Per   contra,     learned     High   Court   Government

Pleader appearing for the State who has mainly relied

upon the statement of Manik S/o Subhash before whom

accused said to have given extra judicial statement

relating to the death of Basawaraj Hodal, wherein the

has assaulted with club and also by means of stone and

committed the murder on 05.09.2018 in between 8.30

a.m. to 9.30 a.m. But, Smt. Shankaremma said to be
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                             11</span>




the second wife of the deceased Basawaraj Hodal had

given statement before the police. Based upon her

complaint, a crime came to be registered against the

unknown person. But, the confession statement which

made by petitioner before C.W.6-Manika, the accused

had been apprehended by the police, thereafter he had

been remanded to the judicial custody. The accused

who is none other than the labourer working in the land

of deceased Basawaraj Hodal committed the murder of

the deceased Basawaraj Hodal by assaulting with club

and stone, which objects have been seized by the

investigation   officer   during   the   course   of   the

investigation by conducting seizure mahazar, which

reflects that there are strong prima facie material

against the accused in committing the alleged offence

and moreover the prosecution has mainly relied upon

the statement of C.W.6-Manik and also C.W.7-Yeshwant

said to be the eyewitness to the incident. These are all

the contentions taken by the learned High Court
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                              12</span>




Government Pleader appearing for the State seeking

dismissal of the bail petition filed by the accused, who

does not deserves for the bail.
</p>
<p id="p_8">
</p><p id="p_9">6.    The contention taken by the learned counsel for

the   petitioner as stated        supra and   also   counter

argument made by the learned High Court Government

Pleader for the State are concerned, it is relevant to look

into the complaint as well as statements of C.W.6-

Manik and C.W.7-Yeshwant.          C.W.7-Yeshwant said to

be the eyewitness, but there is no specific overtact

reveals in his statement that the accused is said to be

assaulted the deceased Basawaraj Hodal by means of

club and stone, said to be seized by the investigation

officer during the course of the investigation. The

prosecution case entirely rests upon the circumstantial

evidence. But, Smt. Sangeeta said to be the wife of the

accused to whom the deceased made some luredness

towards her and also the deceased used to call her to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                                 13</span>




the land to talk whenever he want. Therefore, there was

an enmity developed between the accused and the

deceased for having illicit relationship with the Sangeeta

said to be the wife of the accused. But, the post mortem

report reveals that some injuries inflicted over the

person of the deceased. The material objects i.e., stone

as well as club have been seized by the investigation

officer and the same has been subjected to examination

and also issued the opinion report. The investigation

officer after conducting the investigation laid the charge

sheet against the accused by relaying the statement of

the witnesses and so also conducted the seizure

mahazar said to be seized material objects i.e., club and

stones     so also recording the statement of C.W.7-

Yeshwant said to be eyewitness. The prosecution has

mainly relied upon by the statement of these witnesses.

Therefore, it is stated that at the stage, it does not

require for any detailed discussion while considering the

bail   petition   filed   by   the   accused   as   there   are
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                              14</span>




substances in the contention of the counsel seeking

bail. The learned High Court Government Pleader

emphatically submitted that, if the accused supposed to

be released on bail, certainly he would come in the way

of prosecution. This apprehension of the learned High

Court   Government     Pleader could    be   curtailed   by

imposing suitable conditions to safeguard the interest of

the prosecution.   Hence, I am of the opinion that the

petitioner is entitled to be released on bail. Hence, the

following order is passed.
