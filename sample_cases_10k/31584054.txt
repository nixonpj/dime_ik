                               Smt. Lali Devi and Billu alias Lilu had brought a claim

                 petition under <a href="/doc/136948773/" id="a_1">section 166</a> of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 (for short 'the

                 Act') on the death of their son Ram Kishan in a road side accident that

                 took place on 12.02.2010. The said claim petition has been allowed by

                 the Tribunal in a sum of `6,58,000/-. While FAO No.6993 of 2011 has

                 been brought by Reliance General Insurance Company Ltd. , the insurer

                 seeking to shake off its liability in the matter, FAO No.3130 of 2012 has

                 been brought by the claimants for enhancement of compensation.

</p><p id="p_2">                               On 12.02.2010 at about 1.00 AM Ram Kumar, Ram Kishan

                 and others were going to Delhi from Paprana in a truck bearing

                 registration No. HR-55B-9676. The truck was being driven by Ram

                 Kumar as per traffic rules. Ram Kishan was sitting in the cabin of the

                 said truck. At about 2.30 AM when they had crossed village Chillro, a

                 truck bearing registration No. HR-63-A-7468 which was going ahead of

                 their truck was being driven in a rash and negligent manner. That truck

                 suddenly stopped and though Ram Kumar tried his best to avoid the

                 accident but on account of sudden stopping of the offending truck, his

                 truck had hit the backside of the offending truck. Ram Kumar, Ram

                 Kishan and others had suffered injuries on account of which Ram Kumar

                 and Ram Kishan died. Ram Kishan is claimed to have been aged 23

                 years. He was working as a driver on truck No.RJ-32J-0303 and was

                 earning `10,000/- per month.

                               The claim petition      is resisted by the respondents.

                 Respondents No.1 and 2 have denied any accident to have occurred

                 with their truck. The age, occupation and income of the deceased are

                 also denied. The claimants are denied to deserve any amount as

                 compensation.
</p>
<p id="p_4">                               Noticing the statement of Rajesh, PW-6 that Ram Kishan

                 was working as a driver on his truck bearing registration No. RJ-32G-

                 0303 and was being paid a sum of `10,000/- per month as salary, learned

                 Tribunal has taken the income of the deceased Ram Kishan as `6000/-

                 per month. He has taken the dependency of the claimants, the parents of

                 the deceased at 50% of the same and has, thus, calculated the annual

                 dependency of the claimants at `36,000/-. Learned Tribunal has adopted

                 the multiplier of 18 and assessed a sum of `6,48,000/- as the loss suffered

                 by the claimants in the death of Ram Kishan. Adding a sum of `10,000/-

                 towards loss of estate and funeral expenses, a sum of `6,58,000/- is

                 assessed as compensation.

<p id="p_5">                               Learned counsel for the appellant has contended that the

                 offending truck was not being driven in a rash or negligent manner.

                 According to him, the offending truck was going ahead of truck being

                 driven by Ram Kumar and the driver of the vehicle can apply brakes for

                 some reason but he cannot be blamed by the vehicle coming at its back,

                 which is not maintaining safe distance from the offending vehicle and

                 instead of being able to stop the vehicle rams into the back portion of the

                 offending vehicle. According to him, this way it is shown that the entire

                 responsibility for the accident is of Ram Kumar, who was driving truck

                 No.HR-55B-9676.
</p>
<p id="p_6">                               Learned counsel for the appellant has further submitted that

                 the income of the deceased has been taken at a very higher side.

                 According to him, the deceased is not proved to be a truck driver. He

                 has, moreover, submitted that at the most he could be taken as a skilled

                 labourer and his income assessed at `6000/- is on a higher side.

</p><p id="p_7">                               Learned counsel for the claimants , on the other hand, has

                 submitted that the amount taken as income of the deceased is on lower

                 side. According to him, future prospects have not been considered and no

                 addition to the income has been made in the name of future prospects.

</p><p id="p_8">                               Taking the aspect of negligence first, it has to be seen from

                 the statement of Monu alias Mohan Singh examined as PW-3 that he is

                 an eye witness of the occurrence. He has clearly stated that the truck

                 going ahead of their truck bearing registration No. HR-63A-7468 was

                 suddenly stopped and there was no indication or signal available on the

                 truck showing that brakes have been applied to the same. The witness

                 has been cross-examined at length but it was not suggested to him that

                 the brakes lights of the offending truck were working and they glowed

                 when respondent No.1 applied brakes to the vehicle.

</p><p id="p_9">                               It is the case where respondent No.1 has been proceeded on

                 criminal side for causing this accident. Challan has already been filed by

                 Nothing has come on the record to show that respondent No.1 had made

                 any protest against his false implication.

</p><p id="p_10">                               These circumstances show that the accident has been an

                 outcome of rash and negligent driving of truck No. HR-63A-7468 by

                 respondent no.1.

<p id="p_11">                               Coming to the question of income of the deceased, Rajesh

                 claimed the income of the deceased at `10,000/- per month. Learned

                 Tribunal has rightly ignored his statement. It has not come on the record

                 that Ram Kishan was not a driver. His driving licence Ex.PW6/C is on

                 the record, which itself proves that he was a driver. So income of `6000/-

                 for the deceased Ram Kishan is not on higher side.

</p><p id="p_12">                               Coming to the aspect of increase in the income on account of

                 future prospects, I find the decision of Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in

                 <a href="/doc/121036482/" id="a_3">Rajesh and others v. Rajbir Singh and others</a> 2013(3) RCR (Civil)

                 170 to be coming to the help of the claimants. In this decision, it is

                 laid down that addition to the income has to be made in the name of

                 future prospects even in case of victims, who were self employed or

                 were working on fixed wages. Here the deceased was employed with

                 a truck owner and in future his income would also have increased in

                 consideration of which some amount has to be added in the name of

                 future prospects to the actual income of the deceased.

                 the said addition has to be 50% to the income of the deceased.

                 Adding 50% of `6000/- to it, the income of the deceased comes to

                 `9000/-. Dependency of the claimants is ½ of the same and it comes

                 to `4500/- and the annual dependency of the claimants comes to

                 `54,000/-. Multiplying the annual dependency with 18, I find a sum

                 of `9,72,000/- to have been lost by the claimants in the death of Ram

                 Kishan. Adding to it, a sum of `10,000/- in the name of loss of estate

                 and           expenses on last rites, I assess a sum of `9,82,000/- as

                 compensation in favour of the claimants.

</p><p id="p_13">                                   In the result, the appeal bearing FAO No.3130 of 2012

                 succeeds and is allowed enhancing the compensation from `6,58,000/-,

                 to `9,82,000/-which shall be paid to the claimants with interest @ 6%

                 per annum from the date of filing of petition till the date of realization

                 thereof. The amount shall be shared by the two appellants in equal . The

                 responsibility to pay compensation shall be joint and several of the

                 respondents.

<p id="p_14">                                   However, FAO No.6993 of 2011 fails and is dismissed with

                 no order as to costs.
