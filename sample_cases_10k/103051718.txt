                              Judgment

13/02/2019


           The commonality of the issue in these petitions is as to


whether the petitioners, having applied for appointment to the


post of Constable pursuant to the advertisement dated 25.5.2018,
                                   (80 of 84)          [CW-933/2019]


been then admitted thereto and having passed the written


examination requisite under the Rajasthan Police Subordinate


Service Rules, 1989 (hereafter 'the Rules of 1989') when put


through the PET on various dates, also as required under the


Rules of 1989, were offered appropriate and proper track


conditions for running the 5 km race within the time prescribed of


upto 25 minutes.
</p>

<p id="p_1318">          The petitioners participated in the Physical Efficiency


Test (PET) at Kota either on 7 or 8 or 9 or 10 or 11 or 13,


September, 2018 or on 29.8.2018 at Jaipur (morning or later in


the evening). Amongst the petitioners are also those who though


first required to report for the PET at Maharao Ummed Singh


Stadium, Kota on 6.9.2018 were for reason of 'Bharat Band' on


that date then made to participate in the PET on 9.9.2018.
</p>

<p id="p_1319">          The issue for determination in these petitions as


formulated above, has already been addressed by the Single


Bench of the Principal Seat of this Court at Jodhpur in the case of


Revant Ram Meghwal and others vs. State of Rajasthan &amp;


Others    SBCWP No.13731/2018, and other connected matters


decided on 27.11.2018. Therein it was held that the PET held on


8/9/10.9.2018 at Kota as also the one commencing at 4:02 PM at
                                   (81 of 84)           [CW-933/2019]


Jaipur on 29.8.2018 were vitiated for reasons of suitable running


track not being made available for the candidates as the track/s


were   swampy/   muddied    resultant   from   heavy   rains.   Such


candidates were not able to perform upto their potential and


hence entitled to participate in PET to be conducted afresh. The


aforesaid judgment has not yet been modified or set aside in


appeal--stated to be pending--despite over three and a half


months elapsing. This very issue of suitability of the running


track/s for the PETs following success in the written examination


for the post of Constables pursuant to the advertisement dated


25.5.2018 was thereafter considered in D.B.S.A.W. No.1907/2018


titled <a href="/doc/5065382/" id="a_1">Ravi Kumar Khateek vs. The State of Rajasthan &amp;


Others</a>, and other connected matters, decided on 30.1.2019.
</p>

<p id="p_1320">Therein the Hon'ble DB held that "the nuanced distinction drawn


by the learned Single Judge" apparently also in the case of Revant


Ram Meghwal (supra) vis-a-vis the condition of the running track


at Maharao Ummed Singh Stadium at Kota on 8/9/10.9.2018 on


the one hand and at the same venue on 7/11/13.9.2018 was "too


tenuous". And so was the distinction on the unsuitability of


running track at Jaipur on 29.8.2018 in the evening vis-a-vis in


the morning--held the Hon'ble DB. The DB then proceeded to
                                    (82 of 84)          [CW-933/2019]


conclude and hold that the running track at Maharao Ummed


Singh Stadium, Kota on 7/11/13.9.2018 was also unsuitable for


the PETs. It further held that aside of running track at Jaipur on


29.8.2018 being unsuitable for holding of PET at 04:02 PM, it was


also unsuitable for the PET held earlier in the morning. Such


candidates were thus also entitled to a fresh PET.
</p>

<p id="p_1321">           Mr.Vishna Ram, Addl. S.P. (Legal Cell), present in


person for the respondent- Department, as the Advocates are on


strike and do not today represent the State, states that a DB


Special Appeal Writ has been filed against the judgment passed by


the Single Judge in the case of Revant Ram Meghwal (supra) but


no order thereon has yet been passed. He further states, on the


Court's query in that regard, that he has no information with


regard to any SLP/ Review Petition having been filed against the


judgment passed in the case of Ravi Kumar Khateek (supra).
</p>

<p id="p_1322">           Having taking into consideration the facts of the case, I


am of the considered view that this Court has in the circumstance


no option except to allow all these petitions in respect of


candidates for the recruitment of Constables pursuant to the


advertisement dated 25.5.2018 who were successful in the written


examination and but unsuccessfully participated in the PET on
                                    (83 of 84)            [CW-933/2019]


29.8.2018 at Jaipur and on 7/8/9/10/11/13.9.2018 at Kota for the


reason that the running track for the PET on the said dates was


unsuitable and hence vitiated. The petitioners are thus entitled to


be given a chance afresh for participating in the PET. This for the


reasons that this Court is bound by the findings of fact by the SB


of this Court in the case of Revant Ram Meghwal (supra) and the


DB in the case of Ravi Kumar Khateek (supra) where it has been


held that the running tracks for the PET on the dates recorded


above were unsuitable in view of heavy rains for reason of which


the petitioners before this court could not perform upto their


potential and were unfairly disadvantages.
</p>

<p id="p_1323">          Consequently, I would allow these petitions.
</p>

<p id="p_1324">          This judgment however no doubt will be subject to any


variation/ modification/ setting aside of the order passed by Single


Judge in the case of Revant Ram Meghwal (supra) in the appeal


thereagainst and variation/ modification/ setting aside by the Apex


Court in any appeal filed or may be filed against the judgment


dated 30.1.2019 passed in the case of Ravi Kumar Khateek


(supra) or review thereof. Further it is directed that the relief


granted in this judgment will only be available to those petitioners
                                                                       (84 of 84)          [CW-933/2019]


                                   who, on verification, are found to have earlier participated in PST/


                                   PET on the dates earlier notified to them.
</p>

<p id="p_1325">                                              These petitions are accordingly allowed.
