       The High Court Of Madhya Pradesh
                 MCRC-29412-2018
                 (TONI SHAH Vs THE STATE OF MADHYA PRADESH THR)


Gwalior, Dated : 01-10-2018
      Shri D.D.Sharma, learned counsel for the applicants.
      Shri Avneesh Singh, learned Public Prosecutor for the respondent</pre>
<p id="p_1">No.1/State.
</p><p id="p_2">      The present petition under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_1">Section 482</a> of Cr.P.C. has been
preferred by the applicants for quashment of F.I.R. registered against the
applicants before the Police Station Maksoodangarh, District Guna for
alleged offences under <a href="/doc/838469/" id="a_2">Sections 452</a>, <a href="/doc/594493/" id="a_3">294</a>, <a href="/doc/1011035/" id="a_4">323</a>, <a href="/doc/180217/" id="a_5">506</a> &amp; <a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_6">34</a> of IPC.
</p><p id="p_3">        It is narrated in the petition that case of the prosecution is in
respect of an incident occurred on 11.02.2018 whereby accused persons
(present applicants) reached the complainants' house and asked to vacate
the house. Complainant denied them. Thereafter, all accused persons
committed physical and verbal abuse as narrated in the FIR and
mishandled wife of the complainant. According to learned counsel for
the applicants, the complaint is based upon false allegations made by
complainant in pursuance of his intention to exert undue pressure on the
applicants to enter into compromise or withdraw earlier criminal case.
It is further submitted that as per the mandate of the Hon'able Apex Court
in the case of State of Haryana &amp; Ors Vs. Ch.Bhajan Lal, AIR 1992
SC 604, no case is made out prima facie against the applicants, and
therefore, pendency of the proceedings against the applicants is abuse of
process of law. Applicant are innocent and have been falsely implicated
by the complainant.
</p><p id="p_4">       Learned Public Prosecutor for the respondent No.1/State opposed
the prayer made by the applicants on the ground that statements of
witnesses have been taken in which Iqbal Ali, Sarifan Bano, Hamida
Bano and Haider Ali have specifically made statements about the
conduct of the applicants. They mishandled the female members of the
family and physical and verbal abused the complainants. Learned Public
Prosecutor for the respondent No.1/State referred the list of cases
pending against the applicant No.1 Toni Shah and prayed for dismissal of
this petition.
</p><p id="p_5">       It is settled in law that jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_7">Section 482</a> of Cr.P.C. is
to be exercised in exceptional circumstances.
</p><p id="p_6">       Here in the present case, applicants are facing trial in respect of
                                  2                          MCRC-29412-2018
  the allegations referred above. The applicants have committed house-
  trespass and the statements of the witnesses have suggested that the case
  is liable to be tried because they have made specific allegations against
  the applicants. Once the allegations are in specific terms and the
  statements of the witnesses as well as the charge sheet reflect the
  involvement on the basis of statements of the victims, no interference can
  be made at this juncture. This Court can interfere under the extraordinary
  jurisdiction.
</p><p id="p_7">        The petition sans merits and is hereby dismissed.
</p>
