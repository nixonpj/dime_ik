Date of Pronouncement                           :       19/07/2019


Per : Hon'ble the Chief Justice

</p><p id="p_24">1.        This judgment disposes of three connected appeals

which challenge the common judgment and order of a learned

Single Judge whereby, the State of Rajasthan's (hereafter "the

State") review petitions were dismissed and the earlier directions,

made by the Single Judge, left undisturbed.

</p><p id="p_25">2.        Brief facts are that an advertisement dated 31/05/2008

was issued by the State through the District Education Officer,

Bhilwara inviting applications to fill up 1590 posts of Prabodhaks.

It is not in dispute that these selections were conducted over 10

years ago and the appointments were made about a decade ago.

The respondents in these petitions (i.e. original writ petitioners)

approached    this   Court,       by      filing     SBCWP       Nos.5125/2015,

5126/2015 and 5227/2015. Those writ petitions sought a direction

to the State to arrange the select list by including candidates who

had secured 43% marks or more marks in the open category and

then migrate the OBC and the other reserved categories securing

that cut off or above, into the general category and for a further

direction that a fresh list of OBC category candidates be drawn,

having regard to the number of posts reserved.

</p><p id="p_26">3.        The Single Judge noted that the cut off marks for open

category candidates were 53 and that nevertheless on scrutiny,

several candidates were found ineligible. In the first impugned

order (i.e. 17/12/2015 allowing the writ petitions), the Single

Judge held that candidates were invited after despite their

securing marks below the cut off marks i.e. 53%. It was further
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                     (Downloaded on 01/09/2019 at 08:12:17 PM)</span>
                                                                     DBSAW No.68/2019

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                          4</span>


held that the last candidate selected in the open category secured

43% marks. It was in these circumstances that the single judge -

by the first original impugned judgment held that "migration of

OBC   and    other    reserved       categories         candidates      have   been

permitted if they secured 43 or more marks" and a list of OBC

category candidates was drawn thereupon. Based upon these

assumptions, the Single Judge directed as follows:-


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">             "It is not in dispute that the cut off marks for
      open category is now 43 percent and as per the
      settled law, those reserve caste candidates possess
      more marks than the last candidate in the open
      category, needs to be migrated in the open category.
      The list of OBC and SC/ST candidates is to be drawn
      thereupon to the extent of reservation.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">             In the light of the aforesaid, these writ petitions
      are allowed with the direction to the respondents to
      arrange the list in the manner indicated herein above
      and for clarification, it is again directed that after
      drawing the merit list of open category, which
      include every candidate if secured 43 percent or
      more marks, they would draw the merit list of OBC
      and other reserve caste category. The post meant for
      OBC candidate would be filled by drawing the merit
      list to the size of the post reserved for them and if
      the petitioners find place in the merit list to the size
      of the vacancies and otherwise eligible, they would
      be given appointment within a period of one month
      from the date of receipt of copy of this order."
</blockquote>


<p id="p_27">4.          The State approached the Single Judge in review

proceedings, contending that the petitioner (Omprakash, in

SBCWP No.5125/2015 and two others) had approached the

Principal   Seat     at   Jodhpur,       whereby          his     petition   (SBCWP

No.7510/2010) was rejected on 15/01/2014. The main ground on

which the petitioner had approached the court was that the rules

did not postulate minimum marks for selection and, therefore, the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                      (Downloaded on 01/09/2019 at 08:12:17 PM)</span>
                                                                 DBSAW No.68/2019

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                        5</span>


rejection of his candidature was improper. It was further stated

that the petitioners' name found place at Sr.Nos.1427, 1424 and

1418 but ignoring their candidature one Kailash Chand Koli at

Sr.No.1447 was appointed. The appellant refuted this allegation

contending that whereas the petitioners belong to Other Backward

Class (OBC Category) Kailash Chand Koli belonged to the SC

category. On the basis of the submissions and having regard to

the pleadings the court noticed that two petitioners had obtained

only 21 and one had obtained 23 marks, respectively in interview

whereas the last appointment was given to a candidate who

secured 33 marks in the OBC category. Therefore, it was held, as

follows:
</p>
<p id="p_28">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">     "In view of above fact, there is no substance in the
     argument of learned counsel for the petitioners,
     therefore, no direction can be issued to provide
     appointment to the petitioners on the ground that
     minimum 33 marks are not prescribed in the rules. Here
     in this case, the denial of appointment is not on the
     ground that the petitioners did not obtain minimum 33
     marks but denial of appointment is on the ground that
     last appointment has been given to the candidate, who
     secured 33 marks. It is also worthwhile to observe that
     selection process was initiated in the year 2008 which
     has already been completed, therefore, at this stage, no
     case is made to issue any direction to the respondents.
     Hence, this writ petition is dismissed on this ground
     also."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_29">5.         Apart from this contention, it was also submitted that

some of the petitioners had approached this Court earlier through

yet another writ petition i.e. SBCWP No.1945/2013, which was

disposed of on 12/02/2013 giving them liberty to approach the

department   with   a    representation.          That      representation   was

disposed by a speaking order dated 19/11/2013. The petitioners
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                    (Downloaded on 01/09/2019 at 08:12:17 PM)</span>
                                                                DBSAW No.68/2019

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                       6</span>

claiming to be aggrieved preferred contempt proceedings (S.B.

Civil Contempt Petition No.815/2013) and that too was rejected

and the contempt notice was discharged. The learned Advocate

General who appeared for the State cited suppression of material

facts and res judicata as the main ground to urge that the fresh

round of litigation was barred, inasmuch as, the writ petitioners

deliberately kept silent about the earlier proceedings and in view

of this fact their petitions were dismissed. It was argued that the

contention which found favour with the Single Judge that once the

cut off marks decreased from 53% to 43% - OBC category

candidates who secured 43% or more marks had to be "migrated

to the open category" and in such an event, they cannot be

considered against the post reserved for OBC category. It was

argued on behalf of the State that this contention is utterly

untenable. In the writ proceedings the reply clearly stated that

1590 posts advertised out of which, 813 posts were bifurcated for

open category candidates and 333 posts were bifurcated for OBC

category candidates. It was submitted that the last candidate in

the open category was Meena Kumari Vyas who secured 53%

marks. It was urged that after declaration of the merit list, the

State realized that there were several eligible candidates with

requisite teaching experience of 5 years but they were deprived

from inclusion of their names in the select list as they were lower

down in merit. To accommodate them, 33 more marks for

Prabodhak posts were sanctioned for Bhilwara District which

included 19 posts of General Category and 6 posts for OBC

Category. It was stated that these posts were filled by the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                   (Downloaded on 01/09/2019 at 08:12:17 PM)</span>
                                                                   DBSAW No.68/2019

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                                          7</span>

candidates with requisite experience who were working in the

government projects. It was further stated that even after filling

such posts, some candidates were deprived of selection and they

in turn approached the court and were granted relief as a result of

which, the Director had to sanction some more posts to

accommodate them and comply with the court's order. These

candidates, it is submitted were appointed on 06/12/2012 having

regard to the merit list.
</p>
<p id="p_30">6.           The State submits that the argument that the cut off

had slipped below 53 marks is incorrect because the last candidate

selected in open category against 1590 posts in fact secured 53%

marks. As far as those who secured less marks (who were

appointed) is concerned, the posts were created and appointments

made, on account of court's directions.
</p>
<p id="p_31">7.           In support of this contention, the State relied upon an

additional    affidavit   explaining          the    circumstances     in   which

additional number of individuals were appointed by virtue of

pleadings filed in the review proceedings. In this regard, reliance

is placed on a letter dated 28/02/2009 whereby 14 candidates

were given appointment. These candidates were Para Teachers

working in various government projects, who possessed the

prescribed qualifications but could not be accommodated due to

non-availability of posts. These individuals had approached the

court in various writ petitions; consequent upon this, orders dated

08/02/2010 and 27/04/2011 were passed.
</p>
<p id="p_32">8.           It is submitted that the State specifically pleaded in the

review petitions, as follows:-

"8. That as already submitted 43 vacancies other
and above than the vacancies advertised that is 813
in Zila Parishad, Bhilwara have already filled in. Thus
total 856 persons have been appointed in the General
Category in the manner aforesaid. To be specific 20
persons out of the list of 28 candidates already
submitted have been appointed on account of their
merit being above the cutoff marks of 53, in General
Category, 16 candidates (14+2) have been appointed
in accordance with the various orders passed by the
Hon'ble High Court in pursuance to the newly created
post by the Government itself. Similarly 7 have been
appointed on account of Vishnu Kanwar's case. This
takes the figure to 856 (813+20+16+7).
</p>
<p id="p_35">9.   That as already submitted for OBC category as
against the total posts advertised 333, 27 more
appointments have been given i.e. upto 360 and the
last male candidate is Phool Mohammed who has
secured 33 marks. Thus, in total 360 candidates in
OBC category have been appointed other than those
172 OBC category candidates who have been given
appointment on account of their own merit by shifting
them from OBC TO General. Thus, 532 OBC
candidates selected. 172 OBC to General and 360
from OBC to OBC. A list of 360 candidates and 172
candidates are also being submitted herewith and
marked as Annexure-MMA/5 collectively.
</p>
<p id="p_36">10. That certain persons were not covered by
Annexure-MMA/4 nor covered by Annexure-MMA/2-A
had also been selected and appointed who were
having less than 53 marks. A list of all those
candidates selected in General category is being
submitted herewith and marked as Annexure-MAA/6.
Since more persons from the size of the vacancies
have been appointed. An amended merit list was
prepared on 16.05.2011. However, since those
appointed in the year of 2008/09 were sought to be
removed as having secured less than the final merit
of 53 marks. A litigation ensued rejecting into an
order of this Hon'ble Court in pursuance to which
more seats were created and as many as 43 more
persons were accommodated beyond the size of the
vacancy. This extra posts were from the candidates
mentioned in Annexure-MAA/2, Annexure-MAA/2-A
and Annexure-MAA/4 also. However, the matter of
fact remains that upto the size of the vacancies of
813 for General category, the final cutoff was 53
includes 172 candidates who were migrated from OBC
to General category. A copy of the order dated
06.09.2012 is being submitted herewith and marked
as Annexure-MAA/7."

</p><p id="p_39">9.        It is thus argued that the basis of the learned Single

Judge's direction i.e. that the cut off marks (for appointment) was

lowered to below 53% marks (the original cut off marks) for open

category candidates is not correct; that increase in the number of

posts was on account of some individuals being erroneously

declared as ineligible which resulted in court's order and creation

of further posts. The Advocate General argued that seeking to

derive advantage of this, others approached the court contending

that the cut off marks were less than 53% and had become 43%.

</p><p id="p_40">10.       The learned Advocate General relied upon the previous

order made by the Principal Seat at Jodhpur rejecting the present

petitioners' contention on the ground that appointments had been

completed and that the directions could not be issued. It was

stated that without disclosing the filing or outcome of the earlier

proceedings (SBCWP No.7310/2010), the present petitioners could

not have approached the court. The learned Advocate General

further submitted that as against original 1590 posts advertised,

the total number of posts were increased to 1671 (i.e. increase by

81 posts) including the OBC category which was increased to 362.

He urged that there is no question of accommodation for present

petitioners on the ground that cut off marks for OBC category

candidates was 33% and there is no material on record that

anyone possessing with less than 33% marks was appointed or

that any OBC category candidate was allowed to migrate to the

open category.
</p>
<p id="p_41">11.       The learned Advocate General submitted that the

impugned orders would result in grave consequences and involve

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">                                       10</span>

</p><p id="p_42">- after 10 years, a re-working of the entire select list resulting in

migrating 561 candidates (to the open category), and termination

of equal number of open category candidates despite the fact that

the selection was completed and the appointments (made of the

selected candidates) over 8-10 years ago. Relying upon the

judgment in R.K. Sabharwal Vs. State of Punjab - (1995) 2 SCC

745, it was submitted that the concept of migration undoubtedly

applies and has to be given effect to where reserved category

candidates have secured marks commensurate with the open

category meritorious      candidates. However no instruction or

guidelines require the reserve category to be treated as a general

category by re-opening finalized selections after appointments are

made. It was stated that the process cannot be done again and no

candidate who is less merited in the reserved category can assert

as a matter of right after the life of a select list has expired and

even the period of working of the wait list ends.

</p><p id="p_43">12.        Counsel for the writ petitioners Mr. Kumawat urged that

the original appeal against the main impugned order dated

17/12/2015 was withdrawn by the State although with liberty to

seek review. Having not succeeded, and also having lost in the

review proceedings, the State is now precluded from pursuing the

appeal contending that it is aggrieved by the impugned order

passed in the review petition.
</p>
<p id="p_44">13.        Mr. Kumawat also relied upon the State position's and

submitted that there was no dispute that the last open category

candidate selected and appointed did not have 53% marks but

had 43% marks. Counsel emphasized that the State has nowhere

established that the appointments made pursuant to the court's

orders or otherwise were wrong. He further relied upon an order

issued by the State on 16/05/2013, with respect to the correct

state of figures leading to appointments, which are subject-

matters of the present case.
</p>
<p id="p_45">14.       Mr. Kumawat submitted that there is no question of

delay or res judicata because the facts which emerged after due

consideration and which led the writ petitioners to approach this

Court, were not within their knowledge. As a result, the State's

argument that the entire material would require re-visiting, has no

merit.
</p>
<p id="p_46">Analysis and findings

</p><p id="p_47">15.       The preceding factual analysis would reveal that the

State advertised the vacancies as far back as in May, 2008. The

selection process ended sometime in 2009; the selection involved

1590 vacancies. The total vacancies advertised for being filled by

general category candidates, was 813 (this was increased to 856

due to court orders). 333 vacancies were advertised for OBC

candidates; ultimately, 27 additional posts were created and filled

for this category due to courts' directions- the total tally being

</p><p id="p_48">360. Furthermore, the State affirmed that in addition to these

360, 172 OBC candidates were given the benefit of migration (to

open category vacancies) due to their meritorious performance.

Consequently, the select list finally operated by the State

comprised 532 OBC candidates (out of 1671). Concededly, the last

successful candidate - in the open category to be selected and

appointed, had obtained 53% marks. It is not disputed by the writ
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">                   (Downloaded on 01/09/2019 at 08:12:17 PM)</span>
                                                                  DBSAW No.68/2019

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">                                        12</span>

petitioners that the cut off marks for OBC candidates - in the

original process of selection - was 33%. It is also not in dispute

that the three writ petitioners who approached this court in 2015

were OBC candidates; further they do not dispute that they had

considerably lower marks in comparison with the last OBC

candidate's marks- two of them had secured 21% and one of

them had secured 27 marks. Furthermore, the record also reveal

that the total number of candidates appointed was 1671; the

State attributes this number to various orders of court, and does

not admit that the reason was lowering of cut off percentage in

the general category. Rather, its additional affidavit states that as

against a total of 1590 advertised posts, 1671 were finally

appointed.
</p>
<p id="p_49">16.          These facts, in the opinion of the court, clearly reveal

that the process of selection and filling of vacancies had ended- by

the time the writ petitioners approached the court in 2015

complaining that the last cut off marks in the open category

candidates' list had slipped from below the original cut off marks

of 53%. The writ petitioners did not provide any concrete evidence

about how the cut off marks had dropped to 43% and who was

the candidate selected and appointed that had secured 43%.

Crucially, two of the writ petitioners - who approached this court,

in 2015, had filed a writ petition earlier- before the principal seat

at Jodhpur. That petition (SBCWP No.7510/2010) was rejected on

15/01/2014. This fact has been concealed calculatedly from the

court in the present, fresh proceedings.

</p><p id="p_52">17.        An examination of the pleadings in the writ petition -

as well as the State's review petition and its additional affidavit,

discloses that the State had explained all the relevant facts and

denied that the cut off marks had lowered, due to filling up of

vacancies (which was the principal ground for the petitioners in

this round of litigation). It had crucially, revealed that the process

of migration or shifting of candidates from inter alia, the OBC to

general category had resulted in 532 OBC candidates being

appointed- as against the 333 advertised vacancies according to

the original notification (which was increased to 360 due to court

orders). Thus, 172 candidates had been shifted or "migrated" to

the open category. Correspondingly, 172 OBC candidates who

were lower in merit in the original list, were pushed up and

secured appointed. With the appointment of the last of these

candidates,   the   process       ended.        The      rejection   of   SBCWP

No.7510/2010, on 15/01/2014 was precisely on this ground.

Therefore, this court is of opinion that the learned Single Judge

fell into error in directing the State to re-open the process and

work out the merit position of the present writ petitions.

</p><p id="p_53">18.        What the petitioners seek essentially, is the re-opening

of the entire process of selection, on tenuous arguments that a

fresh list of OBC candidates, to draw a new select list, is

necessitated because of lowering of the last cut off marks of open

category candidates. As discussed previously the process of

"migration" or shifting of OBC candidates in the present case,

resulted in the inclusion of additional 172 OBC candidates in the

select list. The actual number of OBC candidates swelled to 532,

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">                                     14</span>

on the last count, as a result of creation and filling of 27 additional

vacancies, and migration of 172 candidates to the general list.

</p><p id="p_54">19.          The writ petition, in the opinion of this court, when filed

in 2015, was entirely misconceived and the learned Single Judge

fell into error in entertaining it. Selections were completed in

2009; appointments were made - and completed - soon after. In

these circumstances, asking the State to revisit the entire process

would result in upsetting a settled issue. The State points out-

quite correctly, that this has major repercussions, inasmuch as a

wholesale review of the select list (nothing short of which can be

sufficient for compliance with the Single Judge's directions) and

pushing down- even termination, of hundreds of candidates, who

were appointed a decade ago and who have in all probability been

confirmed, earned increments and progressed in their careers.

</p><p id="p_55">20.          Even more fundamentally, the concept of migration-

which the petitioners bank upon entirely in these proceedings,

cannot be an endless affair. It is not by itself a source of

recruitment. It is, rather, a method to ensure that a candidate

claiming benefit of reservation, who secures a sufficiently high

place on the merit list, is to be shifted to the open category, so as

to accommodate another candidate of his category, claiming

reservation, who possibly might not have made it to the select list.

However, there is a finiteness to this procedure, as explained by

the Constitution Bench judgment of the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/1368252/" id="a_1">Union

of India (UOI) v. Ramesh Ram &amp; Ors</a> : (2010) 7 SCC 234:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_4">      "46. Reference was also made to <a href="/doc/1871744/" id="a_2">R.K. Sabharwal v. State of
      Punjab</a> (1995) 2 SCC 745, this Court had declared that the
      State shall not count a Reserved Category candidate
      selected in the (Downloaded
                       open category          against the vacancies in the
                                  on 01/09/2019 at 08:12:17 PM)
                                                                  DBSAW No.68/2019

      Reserved Category. However, by this it could not be inferred
      that if the candidate himself wishes to avail a vacancy in the
      Reserved Category, he shall be prohibited from doing so.
      After considering the counsels' submissions and deliberations
      among ourselves, we are of the view that the ratio in that
      case is not applicable for the purpose of the present case.
      That case was primarily concerned with the Punjab Service
      of Engineers in the Irrigation Department of State of Punjab.
      The decision was rendered in the context of the posts
      earmarked for the Scheduled Castes/ Scheduled Tribes and
      Backward Classes on the roster. It was noted that once such
      posts are filled the reservation is complete. Roster cannot
      operate any further and it should be stopped. Any post
      falling vacant in a cadre thereafter, is to be filled from the
      category reserved or general due to retirement or removal of
      a person belonging to the respective category. Unlike the
      examinations conducted by UPSC which includes 21 different
      services this case pertains to a single service and therefore
      the same cannot be compared with the examination
      conducted by UPSC. The examination conducted by UPSC is
      very prestigious and the top-most services of this nation are
      included in this examination. In this respect, it is obvious
      that there is fierce competition amongst the successful
      candidates as well to secure appointments in the most
      preferred services. This judgment is strictly confined to the
      enabling provision of <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_3">Article 16(4)</a> of the Constitution under
      which the State Government has the sole power to decide
      whether there is a requirement for reservations in favour of
      the backward class in the services under the State
      Government..."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_56">21.         The petitioners' contention, in effect, therefore, results

in a demand for review of the select list, entirely based on a fresh

round of "migration" in the select list, which had been finalized

nearly a decade ago. Clearly, that is impermissible. The petitioners

are also guilty of laches; also, those who had approached this

court earlier and did not disclose this aspect clearly in their writ

petitions are also guilty of concealment of material facts. All these

factors disentitled them to relief.
