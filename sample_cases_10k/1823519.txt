HEADNOTE:
The  appellant was a Head Constable attached to	 a  malkhana
where  articles	 seized in connection with  excise  offences
were  kept in deposit.	The appellant was charged  under <a href="/doc/1229833/" id="a_3"> S.
5(1)(c)</a>	 read  with<a href="/doc/1420677/" id="a_4"> s. 5(2)</a>, <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_5">Prevention of  Corruption	Act</a>,
1947,	in   that  he  had   dishonestly   or	fraudulently
misappropriated	 or  otherwise converted to  his  use  these
articles; the charge further stated that a sum of Rs. 9,284-
1-0 was recovered from him which was disproportionate to his
known  sources	of income.  He was acquitted of	 the  charge
under <a href="/doc/1229833/" id="a_6"> s.  5(1)(c)</a> but was convicted under<a href="/doc/1420677/" id="a_7"> s.  5(2)</a>  on	 the
ground that he had failed to account satisfactorily for	 the
possession  of Rs. 9,284-1-0 which was	disproportionate  to
his known sources of income.
Held, that the conviction of the appellant under<a href="/doc/1420677/" id="a_8"> S. 5(2)</a>  of
the  Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947, was  illegal.	 The
only charge against the appellant was of criminal misconduct
under<a href="/doc/1229833/" id="a_9"> S. 5(1)(c)</a> of the Act for dishonestly or	fraudulently
misappropriating  property  entrusted  to him  and  of	this
charge he could have been convicted by invoking the rule  of
presumption under<a href="/doc/733048/" id="a_10"> s. 5(3)</a>.  But since this was not done	 and
he  was acquitted of that charge, he could not be  convicted
of  criminal misconduct referred to in cls. (a), (b) or	 (d)
of <a href="/doc/1229833/" id="a_11"> s. 5(1)</a> for which he had not been charged.	 The  Courts
below had proceeded wrongly on the footing as though  sub-s.
(2)  or sub-s. (3) of<a href="/doc/616856/" id="a_12"> s. 5</a> created an offence;	the  offence
which  was  punishable	under<a href="/doc/616856/" id="a_13"> s. 5</a> (2)	or  which  could  be
founded	 on  the rule of presumption under<a href="/doc/733048/" id="a_14"> S. 5(3)</a>  was	 the
offence	 of criminal misconduct of one or more of the  cate-
gories mentioned in cls. (a) to (d) of sub-s. (1) of S- 5.

1960.	December 7. The Judgment of the Court was  delivered
by
S.K. DAS, J.-This is an appeal by special leave from  the
judgment  and  order  of the High  Court  of  Judicature  at
Allahabad dated March 27, 1958, whereby the said High  Court
maintained the conviction of the appellant under<a href="/doc/1420677/" id="a_15"> s. 5(2)</a>  of
the  Prevention	 of  Corruption Act, 1947 (2  of  1947)	 but
reduced	 the sentence of four years'  rigorous	imprisonment
passed on the appellant by the Special Judge, Kanpur, to two
years' rigorous imprisonment.
</p><p id="p_4">The short facts are these.  The appellant Surajpal Singh was
employed  in  the  Police Department of	 the  Uttar  Pradesh
Government.   He  started his service as a  constable  on  a
salary of Rs. 13 per month from August 1, 1930.	 In 1946 his
pay  was increased to Rs. 46 per month.	 He was appointed  a
Head constable on a salary of Rs. 50 per month in 1947.	  He
officiated as a Sub-Inspector of Police sometime in 1948 and
1949 on a salary of Rs. 150 per month.	On March 1, 1949, he
was  reverted  to his post of Head constable.	Between	 the
dates  February	 27,  1951, and September 9,  1952,  he	 was
posted	as a Head constable attached to the Sadar  Malkhana,
Kanpur.	 The charge against him was that in that capacity he
dishonestly  or	 fraudulently misappropriated  or  otherwise
converted  to his own use many articles,  principally  those
seized in connection with excise offences kept in deposit in
the  said Malkhana.  These articles included opium,  bottles
of liquor etc.	The charge further stated that a sum of	 Rs.
9,284-1-0  was	recovered  on  a  search  of  his  house  on
September   9	and   10,   1952   and	 this	amount	 was
disproportionate  to  the  known sources of  income  of	 the
appellant.  There was an allegation by the prosecution	that
the  acts of dishonest misappropriation etc. were  committed
by the appellant in conspiracy with two other persons called
Bhagawat  Singh	 and Gulab Singh.   Therefore,	the  charges
against the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">973</span>
appellant  were (1) for the offence of conspiracy  under <a href="/doc/1897847/" id="a_16"> s.
120B</a> of the Indian Penal Code; (2) for the offence under <a href="/doc/1229833/" id="a_17"> s.
5(1)(c)</a>	 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947, for	 the
acts  of  dishonest misappropriation or user, read  with <a href="/doc/1420677/" id="a_18"> s.
5(2)</a> of the said Act; and (3) for an offence under<a href="/doc/1317063/" id="a_19"> s. 465</a> of
the Indian Penal Code in respect of a particular entry	said
to  have been forged in the Register of Properties  kept  in
the Sadar Malkhana.
</p><p id="p_5">The  learned Special Judge who tried the appellant  Bhagawat
Singh  and  Gulab Singh recorded an order  of  acquittal  in
respect of the latter two persons.  As to the appellant,  he
was  also  acquitted of all the charges	 except	 the  charge
under<a href="/doc/1420677/" id="a_20"> s. 5(2)</a> of the Prevention of Corruption Act.  On	this
charge	the  learned  Special Judge  recorded  an  order  of
conviction,  but this was based on the sole ground that	 the
appellant  had	failed	to account  satisfactorily  for	 the
possession of Rs. 9,284-1-0 which, according to the  finding
of  the learned Special Judge, was disproportionate  to	 the
known  sources	of income of the appellant.   It  should  be
noted here that the learned Special Judge held the appellant
not guilty of the various acts of dishonest misappropriation
or  user  alleged against him in respect of  the  properties
kept in the Sadar Malkhana.
</p><p id="p_6">In his appeal to the High Court the appellant urged  various
grounds, one of which was that he could not be convicted  on
the  rule of presumption laid down in sub-s. (3) of<a href="/doc/616856/" id="a_21"> s. 5</a>  of
the  Prevention	 of Corruption Act, 1947, when on  the	only
charge	of criminal misconduct alleged under<a href="/doc/1229833/" id="a_22"> s.	 5(1)(c)</a>  of
the  said Act he had been found not guilty.  The High  Court
repelled  this contention and upheld the conviction  of	 the
appellant but reduced the sentence.
</p><p id="p_7">The   principal	 question  before  us  is  whether  in	 the
circumstances of this case, the conviction of the  appellant
on the charge under sub-s. (2) of<a href="/doc/616856/" id="a_23"> s. 5</a> of the Prevention  of
Corruption Act, 1947, by invoking the rule of presumption as
laid down in sub-s. (3) of that section, is correct.
It is convenient to read here<a href="/doc/1000002/" id="a_24"> s. 5</a> of the Prevention
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">123</span>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">974</span>
of <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_25">Corruption Act</a>, 1947, in so far as it is relevant for our
purpose.

accused	 person cannot satisfactorily account, of  pecuniary
resources or property disproportionate to his known  sources
of  income may be proved, and on such proof the court  shall
presume,  unless  the contrary is proved, that	the  accused
person is guilty of criminal misconduct in the discharge  of
his  official duty and his conviction therefor shall not  be
invalid by reason only that it is based solely on such	pre-
sumption."
</p><p id="p_16">Now, learned Counsel for the appellant has put his  argument
on  the	 principal  question in the following  way:  he	 has
submitted  that	 the is not in a position in  an  appeal  by
special leave to go behind the finding of fact arrived at by
the  courts  below.  The appellant, it	appears,  gave	some
explanation with regard to the possession of Rs.  9,284-1-0.
That  explanation was not, however, accepted by	 the  courts
below.	Learned Counsel has submitted that he does not	wish
to  go behind that finding of fact.  He has submitted,	how-
ever,  that  the  scheme  of <a href="/doc/616856/" id="a_27"> s.  5</a>  of	 the  Prevention  of
Corruption Act, 1947 is this: sub-s. (1) defines the offence
of  criminal misconduct in the discharge of his duties by  a
public	servant;  the  offence can be one or  more  of	four
categories  mentioned in cls. (a), (b), (c) and (d):  sub-s.
(2) is the penal section which states the punishment for the
offence	 of criminal misconduct; and sub-s. (3) lays down  a
rule  of presumption and states that no conviction  for	 the
offence	 shall	be invalid by reason only that it  is  based
solely	on  such presumption.  Learned Counsel	has  pointed
out,  rightly  in our opinion, that the charge	against	 the
appellant  in  the present case referred  only	to  criminal
misconduct in the discharge of his duty by a public  servant
of the nature mentioned in cl. (c) of sub-s. (1).  In  other
words,	the  charge against the appellant was  that  he	 had
dishonestly  or	 fraudulently misappropriated  or  otherwise
converted for his own use property entrusted to him etc.  It
was open to the learned Special Judge to have convicted	 the
appellant   of	that  offence  by  invoking  the   rule	  of
presumption  laid down in sub-s. (3).  He did not,  however,
do so.	On the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">976</span>
contrary,  he  acquitted  the  appellant  on  that   charge.
Therefore, learned Counsel has submitted that by calling  in
aid  the  rule of presumption laid down in sub-s.  (3),	 the
appellant  could  not be found guilty of any other  type  of
criminal  misconduct referred to in cls. (a), (b) or (d)  of
sub-s.	(1) in respect of which there was no charge  against
the appellant.
</p><p id="p_17">We  consider that the above argument of learned Counsel	 for
the appellant is correct and must be, accepted.	 This  Court
pointed	 out in <a href="/doc/620182/" id="a_28">C. S. D. Swamy v. The State</a> (1) that  sub-s.
(3)  of<a href="/doc/616856/" id="a_29"> s. 5</a> of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947	does
not  create  a	new offence but only lays  down	 a  rule  of
evidence  which empowers the Court to presume the  guilt  of
the  accused in certain circumstances, contrary to the	well
known principle of Criminal law that the burden of proof  is
always on the prosecution and never shifts on to the accused
person.	 In Swamy's case there were charges for the  offence
of criminal misconduct under two heads, cl. (a) and cl. (d).
The  trial court held the accused person' in that  case	 not
guilty	of  the	 offence under cl. (a)	but  guilty  of	 the
offence	 under cl. (d) by invoking the rule  of	 presumption
laid  down  in sub-s. (3) of<a href="/doc/616856/" id="a_30"> s. 5</a>. The	distinction  between
that  case and the case under our consideration is this:  in
Swamy's case there were two charges either of which could be
founded on the rule of presumption laid down in sub-s.	(3);
but  in	 our  case  there is only  one	charge	of  criminal
misconduct  of	which  the  appellant  has  been  acquitted;
therefore, there is no other charge which can be founded  on
the rule of presumption referred to in sub-s. (3).  This  is
the  difficulty	 with which the respondent is faced  in	 the
present	 case.	 It appears to us that the  learned  Special
Judge and the High Court proceeded wrongly on the footing as
though sub-s. (2) or sub-s. (3) of<a href="/doc/616856/" id="a_31"> s.	5</a> of the Act creates
an offence.  The offence which is  punished under sub-s. (2)
or  can be founded on the rule of presumption laid  down  in
sub-s. (3) must be the offence of criminal misconduct of one
or  more of the categories mentioned in cls. (a) to  (d)  of
sub-s.	(1).  In the case before us the only category  which
was alleged against the appellant was that of category (c),
(1)  [1960] 1 S.C.R. 461.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">977</span>
<p id="p_18">namely, dishonest or fraudulent misappropriation etc.	That
charge having failed, there was no other charge which  could
be  founded on the rule of presumption laid down  in  sub-s.
(3).
</p><p id="p_19">Learned	 Counsel  for  the respondent  State  has  contended
before us that it was open to the appellate Court to  affirm
the conviction of the appellant under sub-s. (2) of<a href="/doc/616856/" id="a_32"> s. 5</a>  by
holding him guilty of the offence of criminal misconduct  of
the category mentioned in cl. (a) or cl. (d) of sub-s.	(1).
We  are	 unable to accept this contention as  correct.	 The
prosecution never alleged that the sum of Rs. 9,284-1-0	 was
the   result  of  the  appellant  habitually  accepting	  or
obtaining  illegal gratification etc.  The prosecution	case
was  that  the sum of Rs. 9,284-1-0 was the  result  of	 the
dishonest  user	 of property which was	entrusted  with	 the
appellant.  It is not open to the appellate Court to  affirm
the  conviction	 of the Appellant on an	 entirely  new	case
never suggested against the appellant at any earlier  stage.
It is unfortunate that in this case the courts below did not
choose to rely on the rule of presumption laid down in	sub-
s. (3) with reference to the charge under cl. (c) of  sub-s.
(1)  of<a href="/doc/616856/" id="a_33"> s. 5</a>. But that misfortune cannot now be repaired  by
evolving  out of a vacuum as it were a new case against	 the
appellant based on cl. (a) or cl. (d) of sub-s. (1) of<a href="/doc/616856/" id="a_34"> s.  5</a>
in support of which no facts were ever alleged or suggested.
For  the reasons given above, we allow this appeal  and	 set
aside  the  conviction	and  sentence  passed  against	 the
appellant.
