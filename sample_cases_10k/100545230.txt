<p id="p_5">    3. Relief


4      The petitioners in support of their case examined one witnesses:-
</p>

<p id="p_6">       PW1 is Smt. Mamta Bhalla, she is petitioner/injured in this case. She tendered
her evidence by way of affidavit as Ex.PW1/1. She relied upon the documents
Ex.PW1/A to Ex.PW1/E. Thereafter PE was closed.
</p>

<p id="p_7">       No witness was examined by the respondents despite opportunities being
granted and counsel for respondent No.3/insurance company stated that he would
rely upon the DAR report, hence RE was closed.
</p>

<p id="p_8">5      I have heard Ld. counsels for the parties besides going through the material
on record carefully.
</p>

<p id="p_9">       ISSUE NO.1:
</p>
<p id="p_10">6      The onus of proving the issue No.1 was on the petitioners. The principles to
be followed in the case of motor accident claims has been laid down by the Hon'ble
High Court of Guwahati in case cited as <a href="/doc/1997644/" id="a_2">Renu Bala Paul and Ors. vs. Bani
Chakraborty and Ors</a>. 1999 ACJ 634 by Hon'ble Guahati High Court that :
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_4">         "In deciding a matter Tribunal should bear in mind the caution
         struck by the Apex Court that a claim before the Motor Accidents
         Claims Tribunal is neither a criminal case nor a civil case. In a
         criminal case in order to have conviction, the matter is to be
         proved beyond reasonable doubt and in a civil case the matter is
         to be decided on the basis of preponderance of evidence, but in a
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                           4</span>
       claim before the Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal, the standard
       proof is much below than what is required in a criminal case as
       well as in a civil case. No doubt before the Tribunal, there must be
       some material on the basis of which the Tribunal can arrive or
       decide    things   necessary     to    be   decided     for   awarding
       compensation. But the Tribunal is not expected to take or to adopt
       the nicety of a civil or of a criminal case. After all, it is a summary
       inquiry and this is a legislation for the welfare of the society.
     In case <a href="/doc/535129/" id="a_3">N.K.V. Bros (P) Ltd. vs. M.Karumai Ammal &amp; Ors</a>.
     (1980) 3 SCC 475 Hon'ble Supreme Court has observed as
     under :-
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">       "In Road accidents are one of the top killers in our country,
       especially when truck and bus drivers operate nocturnally. This
       proverbial recklessness often persuades the courts, as has been
       observed by us earlier in other cases, to draw an initial presumption
       in several cases based on the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur. Accidents
       Tribunals must take special care to see that innocent victims do not
       suffer and drivers and owners do not escape liability merely
       because of some doubt here or some obscurity there. Save in plain
       cases, culpability must be inferred from the circumstances where it
       is fairly reasonable. The court should not succumb to niceties,
       technicalities and mystic maybes. We are emphasizing this aspect
       because we are often distressed by transport operators getting
       away with it thanks to judicial laxity, despite the fact that they do
       not exercise sufficient disciplinary control over the drivers in the
       matter careful driving. The heavy economic impact of culpable
       driving of public transport must bring owner and driver to their
       responsibility to their "neighbour".
</blockquote>

<p id="p_11">7    As the onus of proving the issue No.1 was on the petitioner who sustained
injuries due to the accident.     The petitioner examined one witness i.e PW1
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                           5</span>
petitioner/injured who is also the eye witness of the accident. She deposed the
manner in which the accident took place and blamed the respondent No.1 for
causing the said accident due to rash and negligent driving. She was cross
examined by the respondent No. 1 but during cross examination she specifically
denied the suggestion that the accident was not caused by the offending vehicle
mentioned in the FIR. She further denied the suggestion that the the driver of the
alleged offending vehicle which is party before this Tribunal just helped her after
she suffered injuries and had been got falsely implicated in the accident. She
further denied that the driver of alleged offending vehicle picked her up and helped
her being an old lady who suffered injuries in an accident. Hence, the respondent
No.2 failed to shake the testimony of PW3.
</p>

<p id="p_12">8     The copies of the criminal case record is also placed on the record shows that
the police has prosecuted the respondent No.1/driver of the offending vehicle for
driving the offending vehicle in rash and negligent manner and causing the
accident in question. It is not the case of the respondents that they had lodged any
complaint to any higher authority against alleged false implication of respondent
no. 1 in criminal case. It is also not their case that they had any previous enmity
with petitioner or IO of the case which facilitated them to involve respondent no. 1
in the alleged false case. Accordingly it is held that accident had taken place due to
rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle No. DL 6SB 1434 by respondent no.
1 by which injured had suffered grievous injuries and there was no negligence on
his part. Accordingly, this issue is thus decided in favour of petitioner and against
the respondents.

<p id="p_13">      ISSUE NO.2


9     Hon'ble Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/1867643/" id="a_4">Govind Yadav vs. The New India Insurance
Company Limited, Civil Appeal No</a>. 9014 of 2011 decided on 01.11.2011 has
observed as under:
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                          6</span>
<p id="p_14">           "The personal sufferings of the survivors and disabled persons are
manifold. Some time they can be measured in terms of money but most of the
times it is not possible to do so. If an individual is permanently disabled in an
accident, the cost of his medical treatment and care is likely to be very high. In
cases involving total or partial disablement, the term "compensation" used in
<a href="/doc/136948773/" id="a_5">section 166</a> of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 (for short, "the Act") would include not
only the expenses incurred for immediate treatment, but also the amount likely to
be incurred for future medical treatment/care necessary for a particular injury or
disability caused by an accident. A very large number of people involved in motor
accidents are pedestrians, children, women and illiterate persons. Majority of them
cannot, due to sheer ignorance, poverty and other disabilities, engage competent
lawyers for proving negligence of the wrongdoer in adequate measure. The
insurance companies with whom the vehicles involved in the accident are insured
usually have battery of lawyers on their panel. They contest the claim petitions by
raising all possible technical objections for ensuring that their clients are either
completely absolved or their liabilities minimized. This results in prolonging the
proceedings before the Tribunal. Sometimes the delay and litigation expenses'
make the award passed by the Tribunal and even by the High Court (in appeal)
meaningless. It is, therefore, imperative that the officers, who preside over the
Motor Accident Claims Tribunal adopt a proactive approach and ensure that the
claims filed under <a href="/doc/136948773/" id="a_6">Sections 166</a> of the Act are disposed of with required urgency
and compensation is awarded to the victims of the accident and/or their legal
representatives in adequate measure. The amount of the compensation in such
cases should invariably include pecuniary and non-pecuniary damages. <a href="/doc/1794525/" id="a_7">In R.D.
Hattangadi v. Pest Control (India) Private Limited</a> MANU/SC/0146/1995:
(1995) 1 SCC 551, this Court while dealing with a case involving claim of
compensation under the <a href="/doc/785258/" id="a_8">Motor Vehicles Act</a>, 1939, referred to the judgment of the
Court of Appeal in Ward v. James (1965) - All ER 563, Halsbury's Laws of
England, 4th Edition, Volume 12 (page 446) and observed:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">        "Broadly speaking while fixing an amount of compensation
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                              7</span>
        payable to a victim of an accident, the damages have to be
        assessed separately as pecuniary damages and special damages.
        Pecuniary damages are those which the victim has actually
        incurred and which are capable of being calculated in terms of
        money; whereas non-pecuniary damages are those which are
        incapable of being assessed by arithmetical calculations. In order
        to appreciate two concepts pecuniary damages may include
        expenses incurred by the claimant: (i) medical attendance, (ii)
        loss of earning of profit up to the date of trial, (iii) other material
        loss. So for non-pecuniary damages are concerned, they may
        include (i) damages for mental and physical shock, pain and
        suffering, already suffered or likely to be suffered in future, (ii)
        damages to compensate for the loss of amenities of life which
        may include a variety of matters i.e. on account of injury the
        claimant may not be able to walk, run or sit; (iii) damages for the
        loss of expectation of life, i.e, on account of injury the normal
        longevity of the person concerned is shortened; (iv)
        inconvenience, hardship, discomfort, disappointment, frustration
        and mental stress in life".

<blockquote id="blockquote_7">            In the same case, the court further observed:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_8">        "In its very nature whenever a tribunal or a court is required to
        fix the amount of compensation in cases of accident, it involves
        some guesswork, some hypothetical consideration, some amount
        of sympathy linked with the nature of the disability caused. But
        all the aforesaid elements have to be viewed with objective
        standards".

<blockquote id="blockquote_10">        "At the same time we often find that a person injured in an
        accident leaves his family in greater distress vis-...-vis a family in
        a case of death. In the latter case, the initial shock gives way to a
        feeling of resignation and acceptance, and in time, compels the
        family to move on. The case of an injured and disabled person is,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                          8</span>
        however, more pitiable and the feeling of hurt, helplessness,
        despair and often destitution ensures every day. The support that
        is needed by a severely handicapped person comes at an
        enormous price, physical, financial and emotional, not only on
        the victim but even more so on his family and attendants and the
        stress saps their energy and destroys their equanimity".</blockquote>

<p id="p_16">            <a href="/doc/86908489/" id="a_12">In Reshma Kumari v. Madan Mohan</a> Manu/SC/1303/2009: (2009)
13 SCC 422, this Court reiterated that the compensation awarded under the Act
should be just and also identified the factors which should be kept in mind while
determining the amount of compensation. The relevant portions of the Judgment
are extracted below:
</p>

<p id="p_17">            The compensation which is required to be determined must be just.
While the claimants are required to be compensated for the loss of their
dependency, the same should not be considered to be a windfall. Unjust enrichment
should be discouraged. This Court cannot also lose sight of the fact that in given
cases, as for example death of the only son to a mother, she can never be
compensated in monetary terms.

<p id="p_18">            <a href="/doc/1907288/" id="a_13">In Arvind Kumar Mishra v. New India Assurance Co. Limited</a>
Manu/SC/0777/2010: (2010) 10 SCC 254, the Court considered the plea for
enhancement of compensation made by the Appellant, who was a student of final
year of engineering and had suffered 70% disablement in a motor accident. After
noticing factual matrix of the case, the Court observed:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_11">        "We do not intend to review in detail state of authorities in
        relation to assessment of all damages for personal injury. Suffice
        it to say that the basis of assessment of all damages for personal
        injury is compensation. The whole idea is to put the claimant in
        the same position as ho was insofar as money can. Perfect
        compensation is hardly possible but one has to keep in mind that
        the victim has done no wrong; he has suffered at the hands of
        the wrongdoer and the court must take care to give him full and
        fair compensation for that he had suffered".</blockquote>

<p id="p_19">            <a href="/doc/153578069/" id="a_14">In Raj Kumar V. Ajay Kumar</a> Manu/SC/1018/2010: (2011) 1 SCC
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                                9</span>
343, the court considered some of the precedents and held:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_12">        "The provision of the <a href="/doc/785258/" id="a_15">Motor Vehicles Act</a>, 1988, ('the Act', for
        short) makes it clear that the award must be just, which means
        that compensation should, to the extent possible, fully and
        adequately restore the claimant to the position prior to the
        accident. The object of awarding damages is to make good the
        loss suffered as a result of wrong done as for as money can do
        so, in a fair, reasonable and equitable manner. The court or the
        Tribunal shall have to assess the damages objectively and
        exclude from consideration any speculation or fancy, though
        some conjecture with reference to the nature of disability and its
        consequences, is inevitable. A person is not only to be
        compensated for the physical injury, but also for the loss which
        he suffered as a result of such injury. This means that he is to be
        compensated for his inability to lead a full life, his inability to
        enjoy those normal amenities which he would have enjoyed but
        for the injuries, and hie inability to earn as much as he used to
        earn or could have earned".</blockquote>

<p id="p_20">            In our view, the principles laid down in <a href="/doc/1907288/" id="a_16">Arvind Kumar Mishra vs. New
India Assurance Company Ltd</a>. (supra) and <a href="/doc/153578069/" id="a_17">Raj Kumar vs. Ajay Kumar</a>
(supra) must be followed by all the Tribunals and the High Court in determining the
quantum of compensation payable to the victims of accident, who are disabled
either permanently or temporarily. If the victim of the accident suffers permanent
disability, then efforts should always be made to award adequate compensation not
only for the physical injury and treatment, but also for the loss of earning and his
inability to lead a normal life and enjoy amenities, which he would have enjoyed but
for the disability caused due to the accident".
</p>

<p id="p_21">            The heads under which compensation is awarded in personal injury
cases are the following:
</p>


<p id="p_22">Pecuniary damages (Special damages):
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_13">            (i)    Expenses    relating   to       treatment,   hospitalization,   medicines,
                  transportation, nourishing food and miscellaneous expenditure.

<blockquote id="blockquote_14">             (ii) Loss of earnings (and other gains) which the injured would         have

             b)      Loss of future earnings on account of permanent disability.
             (iii)    Future medical expenses.

Non Pecuniary damages (General damages):

             (iv)    Damages for pain suffering and trauma as a consequence of
      the injuries.
             (v)     Loss of amenities (and/or loss of prospects of marriage).
             (vi)    Loss of expectation of life (shortening of normal longevity).


</pre><blockquote id="blockquote_15">             In routine personal injury cases, compensation will be awarded only
under heads (i), iii) (a) and (iv).
</blockquote>


<p id="p_23">Pecuniary damages (Special damages):
</p>

<p id="p_24">      Loss of Income


10    Petitioner/injured submitted that on the date of accident i.e. 14.2.2012 she
was 60 years of age and was a housewife. Due to the accident the petitioner fell on
the road and sustained serious injuries and fractured her shoulder and abrasives on
left knee and all over the body and due to the falling the road. Due to the accident
she was unable to discharge her daily work properly till date. The injured failed to
prove on record her earnings etc. In the absence of any proof relating to the
income, qualification etc. of injured, relying upon the precedent of Hon'ble Delhi
High Court raising a legal fiction, I grant the notional income of Rs. 6656/- per
month to the injured and in view of the nature of injuries sustained by her, three
months loss of notional income is granted to her which comes to Rs. 6656 x 3 =
19,968/-.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                          11</span>


<p id="p_25">      Medical Expenses:
</p>

<p id="p_26">11    Petitioner has submitted that had incurred a sum of Rs. 3257/- on her medical
treatment. In support of her claim she has placed on record the medical bills in
original which are amounting to Rs. 3257/- which amount has not been disputed by
the respondents during the examination of PW1. In view of same the petitioner
is entitled for the said amount i.e. 3257/- towards actual medical
expenses.
</p>



<p id="p_27">      Special diet and Conveyance charge:
</p>



<p id="p_28">12        Petitioner has alleged that she spent money on conveyance and special
diet. Though no proof of spending upon special diet is brought on record. In case of
sickness and serious injury, a special diet in the form of healthy food, juices, milk
etc. is provided instead of or in addition to the normal food. Normally each receipt
or bill in respect of conveyance and special diet is not retained by the people.
Hence in absence of any sufficient evidence and complete documentary evidence in
support of special diet and conveyance, I am of the view that maximum petitioner
can be paid Rs. 7,000/- towards special diet and a sum of Rs. 7,000/-
towards conveyance charges.
</p>

<p id="p_29">Non-pecuniary damages (General damages)


     Pain and Sufferings etc:
</p>

<p id="p_30">13          As proved on record the petitioner suffered sustained serious injuries
i.e. fractured her shoulder and abrasions on left knee and all over her body. Hence
judicial notice can be taken of the fact that due to such type of injuries as is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                                                   12</span>
suffered by the petitioner, she could not perform her daily routine work properly.
Difficulty and inconvenience must have arisen to her to perform even daily personal
routine acts due to said accident. She must have suffered great pain and sufferings
and also had undergone some shock of accident. Such type of non pecuniary losses
cannot be assessed in terms of money but keeping in view the age, status and
condition of the petitioner, hospital visits etc. she is granted lump sum amount of
Rs. 30,000/- towards pain and sufferings, inconvenience, mental shock
etc. as per the judgment of Govind Yadav's case (Supra).
</p>

<p id="p_31">14     As it is admitted that the offending vehicle i.e bearing No. DL 6SAB 1434 was
an insured vehicle with the respondent No.3/insurance company. However, the
respondent No.1 i.e. driver of the offending vehicle was minor while driving the
offending vehicle and causing the accident. As per the DAR report the owner of the
vehicle was prosecuted U/s. 5/180 <a href="/doc/785258/" id="a_18">MV Act</a> and the FIR was registered U/s. 279/338
<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_19">IPC</a> &amp; 4/180 <a href="/doc/785258/" id="a_20">MV Act</a> against the Juvenile/respondent No.1 who is the driver of the
offending vehicle. Hence there was breach of terms of the policy and the
respondent No.3/insurance company which has been proved on record. In view of
same, as the offending vehicle has been duly insured with the insurance
company/respondent No.3, at first it becomes liable to make the payment of the
award amount to the petitioner with the right to recover the same from driver and
owner of offending vehicle jointly or severally.
</p>

<p id="p_32">15     In view of the above discussions, this issue is decided in favour of petitioner,
by holding that she is entitled to get the following total compensation from
respondent No.3 only.
