                   the State in the two applications.

<p id="p_3">                             The petitioners in the two applications are in

                   custody in connection with Saharsa Sadar P.S.Case No.267
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1"> Patna High Court Cr.Misc. No.38329 of 2011 (3) dt.31-01-2012                        2</span>




                   of 2011 for offence punishable under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_1">sections 302</a> and

<p id="p_4">                              The first information report was instituted against

                   two persons including the petitioner Raju Kumar of having

                   caused the death of the son of the informant. The

                   involvement of the petitioners herein is on the basis of their

                   confessional statement recorded in the case diary and in

                   which it is stated that whereas the petitioner Mukesh Kumar

                   caught hold of the deceased, co-accused Subesh Kumar

                   pressed his neck until life was driven out of the deceased

                   and during this process, the petitioner Raju Kumar was

                   assaulting him on the chest. The post mortem report present

                   at para-78 of the case diary attributes his death to head

                   injury caused by hard and blunt substance.

                   either of the situation emanating from the confessional

                   statement or the post mortem report, the petitioners herein

                   are not the persons responsible for the death of the

                   deceased. It is further contended that the petitioners have

                   clean antecedent.

                   Mukesh Kumar and (2) Raju Kumar be released on bail

                   upon each one of them individually furnishing bail bonds
