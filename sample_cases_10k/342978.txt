:ORDER  
</pre><p id="p_1">(Order of Court was made by P.  Sathasivam, J.,)


        Aggrieved by the order of Tamil Nadu Administrative Tribunal,  Chennai
dated 11-6-2002,  made  in  Original  Application  No.    1507  of 2001, Rural
Development Department, Finance Department and Director of Rural  Development,  
Government of Tamil Nadu have preferred the above writ petition.
</p>
<p id="p_2">        2.    Tamil  Nadu  Arasu  Uraga  Kudineer  Thitta  Thozhil  Nutpa  Min
Paniyalargal Sangam, first  respondent  herein,  through  its  President  A.N.
Angamuthu  filed  the  above Original Application praying for direction to the
respondents therein (Rural Development and Finance  Department)  to  implement 
G.O.Ms.No.  511,  Finance (PC) Department dated 1 -8-1992 and G.O.Ms.No.  468,   
Finance (Pay Cell) Department dated 31-8-1998 in order to revise the pay scale
of the members of the applicant based on their representation  submitted  from
the  year  1994  onwards  and also on 19-10-2000 to enable them to receive all
consequential monetary benefits (vide  amended  prayer  in  O.A.No.1507/2001).
According  to  the  members of the applicant Association, they are employed as
Electricians in the Rural Water Supply Power  Pump  Maintenance  Wing  in  the
Tamil Nadu  Government.    The pay scale of the members of the Association was 
Rs.275-475.  Thereafter it was revised as 610-1075.  Subsequently, the pay was
revised as Rs.1100-1660 as per G.O.Ms.No.511  Finance  (Pay  Cell)  Department 
dated 1-8-92.    It  is  also their case that the same was followed by all the
departments in the Tamil Nadu Government with effect from  1-6-88.    In  G.O.
Ms.No.   666  Finance  Department  dated 27-6-99, the revised scale of pay was
confirmed.  Since there was no favourable order by the Government, by revising
their scale of pay as per their representation dated  6-7-99  and  16-10-2000,
they approached the Tribunal for necessary direction as stated above.
</p>
<p id="p_3">        3.  It is seen from the order impugned, the Tribunal ordered Notice of
Motion on  28-3-2001.    The  respondents/departments  have  not  filed  reply
conveying their stand.  The Tribunal in the absence of reply by the department
concerned, by relying on G.O.Ms.No.  511 Finance Department dated  1-8-92  and 
after  finding that the uniform pay fixed under the Government Order cannot be
denied to the members of the applicant, directed that they shall be given  the
scale of  pay  as  per  G.O.Ms.No.    511, Finance (Pay Cell) Department dated
1-8-92 and G.O.Ms.No.  468, Finance (Pay Cell) Department,  dated  31-8-98  by
revising  their  pay  scales  with effect from the year 1994 and also directed
that the arrears shall be paid after such re-fixation within  a  period  of  6
months from  the date of its order.  The said order is under challenge in this
writ petition.
</p>
<p id="p_4">        4.  Heard Mr.  D.  Krishnakumar, learned  Special  Government  Pleader
for petitioners and  Mr.    P.    Jayaraman,  learned senior counsel for first
respondent-Sangam.  
</p>
<p id="p_5">        5.  The only point for consideration in this writ petition is, whether
the order of the Tribunal issuing direction for revising the scale of  pay  as
per G.O.Ms.No.511  Finance Department dated 1-8-92 and G.O.Ms.No.  468 Finance    
Department dated 31-8-98 is sustainable?
</p>
<p id="p_6">        6.  Before considering the above issue, it is to  be  noted  that  the
department,  namely,  Rural Development and Finance Department (Pay Cell) have 
not filed reply affidavit conveying their stand before the Tribunal.  In  such
a  circumstance,  the  Tribunal  without  analysing the claim of the applicant
Sangam, basing reliance on G.O.Ms.No.  51 1 Finance Department, dated  1-8-92,  
issued  positive  direction for revision of scale of pay to the members of the
Association.
</p>
<p id="p_7">        7.  Before the Tribunal, it was the specific case of  the  Association
that  the  pay scale for the members of the Association was initially fixed in
the pay scale of Rs.275-475 and thereafter it was revised  as  Rs.610-1075  as
per G.O.Ms.No.      184   Finance   Pay   Cell   Department  dated  21-2-1990.
Subsequently,  the  above  pay  scale  was  revised  as  Rs.1100-1660  as  per
G.O.Ms.No.  511 Finance (Pay Cell) dated 1-8-1992 and the same was followed by  
all  the  Department  concerned  in  Tamil  Nadu Government with retrospective
effect from 1-6-1988 as it has been  specifically  stipulated-vide  G.O.Ms.No.
666  Finance Department dated 27-6-1989 that the effective date of revised pay
scale was asserted and confirmed as 1-6-1988.  Though the Department  has  not 
filed  reply  before  the  Tribunal  controverting the factual details, in the
affidavit filed  before  this  Court,  it  is  specifically  stated  that  the
information  furnished  by  the applicant-Association are factually incorrect.
It is the case of the Department that Fourth Pay  Commission  has  recommended 
the  revision  of  pay  for  the  post of Electrician in the Rural Development
Department as Rs.505-845 against the pre-revised scale of pay  of  Rs.295-475.
Subsequent  to the issue of Fourth Tamil Nadu Pay Commission orders, employees   
of various associations have expressed their dissatisfaction in the scales  of
pay allowed  by  the  Fourth Pay Commission.  Based on the requests of persons 
concerned, the Government have constituted "One Man Committee".  The  One  Man    
Committee  while  examining  the requests for employees in various trade posts
like Electrician, Fitter, Welder etc., in various departments has noticed that
no uniform pattern has been followed in  prescribing  technical  qualification
for those  posts.    The  minimum qualification for admission to ITI course is
SSLC passed or failed depending on the trade.  The One Man  Committee  was  of 
the  view  that with the availability of ITI holders, the qualification of ITI
Certificate  should  be  invariably  adopted  for  all  trade  posts  in   all
departments.    The  Committee  considered  that  the  trade  posts  might  be
classified broadly into two groups based on the qualifications prescribed  for
the posts granting the pay scales as:
</p><p id="p_8">i) SSLC passed plus I.T.I ..  Rs.610-1075
</p><p id="p_9">ii) SSLC failed plus I.T.I.  ..  Rs.555-970
It is the definite case of the Department that for the post of Electrician, no
revision  was  made  based on the recommendation of the One Man Committee till 
the constitution of Fifth Pay Commission.  It is also their  case  that  while
recommending  the  revised  scale  of  pay  for the said post by the Fifth Pay
Commission, the post was placed on Rs.825 - 1200 against the pre-revised scale
of pay  of  Rs.505-845  on  par  with  Group  II  trade  posts  and  also  the
recommendation made  in  the  previous  Pay  Commission.    Subsequently,  the 
Government have examined the request and orders were issued revising the scale
of pay from Rs.825-120 0 to Rs.950-1500 on par with that of Group I trade post
and also the revision was made in the previous Pay Commission from  Rs.505-845 
to Rs.610-1075  with  effect from 1-10-84.  By pointing out the above details,
it is the case of the petitioners that there is no  injustice  caused  to  the
said category.
</p>
<p id="p_10">        8.  Coming  to  G.O.Ms.No.    511  Finance (Pay Cell) Department dated
1-8-1992, the post of Electrician  in  the  Rural  Development  Department  is
sanctioned  with  the  scale  of  Rs.950-1500 on par with that of trade posts.
Learned Special Government Pleader appearing for the petitioners  has  brought
to our  notice  G.O.Ms.No.  141 Rural Development (P3) Department dated 3-8-95
which clearly shows that at the time of creation of 384 posts of  Electrician,
sanction was accorded in the scale of pay of Rs.950-20-1150-25-1500.
</p>
<p id="p_11">        9.   It is brought to our notice that the scale of pay for the post of
Electrician in  the  Rural  Development  Department  was  already  revised  as
Rs.950-1500  based  on the qualification for the post which is SSLC plus I.T.I
in which post is equivalent to Grade II trade  posts.    The  Government  have
issued  orders for the revision of scale of pay for the post of Electrician in
the Rural Development from Rs.505 -845 to Rs.610-1075 in the pre-revised scale
of pay taking note of the qualification prescribed for the post of Electrician
is SSLC with I.T.I as it falls under Group I.   In  such  a  circumstance,  as
rightly pointed out by the learned Special Government Pleader, the question of
revising  the  scale  of  pay for the post of Electrician from Rs.950-15 00 to
Rs.1100-1660 does not arise as it is already  equivalent  to  Grade  II  trade
posts since there is no Grade I trade post in Rural Development Department.
</p>
<p id="p_12">        10.   It is also brought to our notice that in the case of the post of
Electrician,  no  revision  was  made  based  on   the   One   Man   Committee
recommendation till the constitution of the Fifth Pay Commission.  Only in the
Fifth  Pay  Commission,  the  post  of  Electrician  was placed on Rs.825-1200
against the pre-revised scale of pay of Rs.505-8 45 on par with Group II trade
posts.   Subsequently,  the  Government  have  examined  the  request  of  the
Association  and orders were issued revising the scale of pay from Rs.825-1200
to Rs.950-1500.  It is true that  orders  were  issued  in  G.O.Ms.No.    511,
Finance  (PC)  Department  dated  1-8-92 stating that all Grade-II trade posts
such as Wiremen, Plumber, Carpenter, etc., hitherto classified under Group  II
in G.O.Ms.   No.   762, Finance (PC) Department dated 20-8-86 requiring I.T.I.
certificate irrespective of academic qualification be allowed the scale of pay
of Rs.950-1500 and all such  Grade-I  posts  coming  under  this  category  be
allowed the  scale  of pay of Rs.1100-1660.  It is demonstrated before us that
the post of Electrician in the Rural  Development  Department  was  sanctioned
with the scale of Rs.950-1500 on par with that of trade posts (vide G.O.Ms.No.
141 Rural  Development Department dated 3-8-95).  Unfortunately, this relevant
information was not brought to the notice of the Tribunal.    As  pointed  out
earlier,   it  is  the  definite  case  of  the  Department  that  though  the
nomenclature of the post, namely, Electrician is the same in all  departments,
it  is  their  categorical  stand  that  the  Electrician  post  in  the Rural
Development Department is Grade II category post and according to them,  there
is no Grade I post.  However, as rightly pointed out, in G.O.Ms.No.  511 dated
1-8-92,  the  Government  have  directed that all Grade II trade posts such as
Wiremen, Plumber, Carpenter, etc.,  hitherto  classified  under  Group  II  in
G.O.Ms.No.   762,  Finance  (PC)  Department  dated  20-8-86  requiring I.T.I.
certificate irrespective of academic qualification be allowed the scale of pay
of Rs.950-1500 and all such Grade  I  posts  coming  under  this  category  be
allowed the  scale  of  pay  Rs.1100-1660.    In  the Sixth Pay Commission the
existing scale of pay of Rs.950-1500 was changed into Rs.3050-4590.
</p>
<p id="p_13">        11.  It is also brought to  our  notice  that  the  direction  of  the
Tribunal cannot   be  implemented  since  in  G.O.Ms.No.    468  Finance  (PC)
Department  31-8-98,  the  Government  revised  the  scale  of  pay  only   to
Electrician-Grade I  post  and  not  to  Grade-II.    The  perusal of the said
Government Order which is available at page 13 of the additional typed-set  of
papers  filed  by  the  Special  Government Pleader, makes it clear that after
accepting the recommendation of the Official Committee and after  examination,
the  Government  revised  the scale of pay only to Grade I Electrician and not
Grade II.  In such a circumstance, as rightly pointed  out,  the  question  of
revising  the  scale  of  pay  for  the post of Electrician does not arise and
G.O.Ms.No.  468 Finance Department dated 31-8-98  is  not  applicable  to  the
Grade II  posts.    We  have  already  pointed  out  the definite stand of the
Department that there is no Grade  I  post  in  Rural  Development,  and  this
relevant fact was neither placed before the Tribunal nor considered by it.
</p>
<p id="p_14">        12.  Mr.   P.    Jayaraman,  learned  senior counsel appearing for the
first respondent, relied on several decisions, namely, (i) <a href="/doc/1600370/" id="a_2">Y.  K.    MEHTA  v.
UNION  OF  INDIA</a>  [1988  (Supp)  Supreme  Court Cases 750]; (ii) <a href="/doc/129998/" id="a_3">BHAGWAN SAHAI     
CARPENTER v.  UNION OF INDIA</a> [(1989) 2 Supreme Court Cases 299]  (iii)  <a href="/doc/1848396/" id="a_4">F.C.I.  
WORKERS' UNION  v.   F.C.I</a> [AIR 1990 Supreme Court 2178] (iv) <a href="/doc/498991/" id="a_5">SANDEEP KUMAR v.       
STATE OF U.P</a>.  [1993 Supp (1) Supreme Court Cases 525] and (v) <a href="/doc/352233/" id="a_6">UNION OF  INDIA     
v.   BIJOY  LAL GHOSH</a> [AIR 1998 Supreme Court 1192] to show that when posts in   
two wings of the same Government department are  identical  and  involve  same
nature  of duties, denial of parity in pay would be violate of Articles 14, 16
and 39 (d) of the Constitution of India.  Absolutely there is no quarrel  with
regard to the proposition laid down in those decisions.  As pointed out by the
department, there is no Grade I trade post in Rural Development Department and
according  to them, the post of Electrician in the said department is Grade II
trade post.  In such a circumstance, we are of the  view  that  the  decisions
relied  on  by  the  learned  senior  counsel for the first respondent are not
directly applicable to the case on hand.
</p>
<p id="p_15">        13.  In the earlier part of our order, we have referred to the fact of
non-filing of reply by the department.  It is true that in spite of  affording
sufficient  opportunity,  unfortunately  the  department  did  not  file their
defence before the Tribunal  and  even  at  the  time  of  argument,  relevant
information was  not brought to its notice.  In this regard, it will be useful
to refer a decision of the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/461060/" id="a_7">STATE OF HARYANA v.  HARYANA CIVIL     
SECRETARIAT PERSONAL STAFF ASSOCIATION</a>, reported in  (2002)  6  Supreme  Court          
Cases  72 wherein Their Lordships have held that while exercising jurisdiction
under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_8">Article 226</a> of the Constitution, the relief  cannot  be  granted  merely
because  averment in writ petition had not been specifically rebutted and High
Court is bound to consider the averment on its  true  merits  before  granting
relief to  writ  petitioner.    After referring to the decision in the case of
<a href="/doc/1451746/" id="a_9">SECRETARY, FINANCE DEPARTMENT v.  W.B.  REGISTRATION SERVICE ASSOCIATION</a> (1993                  
Supp (1) SCC 153), it was held:  (para 10)

        "10.  It is to be kept in mind that the claim of equal pay  for  equal
work  is  not  a  fundamental  right  vested  in  any  employee though it is a
constitutional goal to be achieved by the Government.   Fixation  of  pay  and
determination  of  parity  in  duties and responsibilities is a complex matter
which is for the executive to discharge.   While  taking  a  decision  in  the
matter,  several relevant factors, some of which have been noted by this Court
in the decided case, are to be  considered  keeping  in  view  the  prevailing
financial position and capacity of the State Government to bear the additional
liability of  a  revised scale of pay.  It is also to be kept in mind that the
priority given to different types of posts under the  prevailing  policies  of
the  State Government is also a relevant factor for consideration by the State
Government.  In the context of the complex  nature  of  issues  involved,  the
far-reaching  consequences  of  a decision in the matter and its impact on the
administration of the State  Government,  courts  have  taken  the  view  that
ordinarily  courts  should not try to delve deep into administrative decisions
pertaining to pay fixation and pay parity.  That is not to say that the matter
is not justifiable or that the courts cannot entertain any proceeding  against
such administrative  decision  taken  by  the  Government.   The courts should
approach such  matters  with  restraint  and  interfere  only  when  they  are
satisfied  that  the decision of the Government is patently irrational, unjust
and prejudicial to a section of employees and the Government while taking  the
decision has ignored factors which are material and relevant for a decision in
the matter.    Even  in  a  case where the court holds the order passed by the
Government to be unsustainable then ordinarily a direction should be given  to
the  State  Government  or the authority taking the decision to reconsider the
matter and pass a proper order.  The court should avoid giving  a  declaration
granting  a particular scale of pay and compelling the Government to implement
the same?.."

<p id="p_37">        In  the light of these details, by applying the ratio laid down in the
above referred decision, we are satisfied that the Tribunal is  not  justified
in  issuing  positive  direction  granting  a  particular  scale  of  pay  and
compelling the Government to implement the same.  
</p>
<p id="p_38">        14.  <a href="/doc/734107/" id="a_10">In UNION OF INDIA v.  TARIT RANJAN DAS</a>, reported in 2003 AIR  SCW  
7082,  Their Lordships have quoted the following passage as expressed by three
Judge Bench of the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/1461305/" id="a_11">STATE BANK OF INDIA v.  M.    GANESH  BABU</a>       
(2002 (4) SCC 556) at para 16:  (para 7)

        "The  principle  of  equal  pay for equal work has been considered and
applied in many reported decisions of this Court.    The  principle  has  been
adequately  explained and crystallized and sufficiently reiterated in a catena
of decisions of this Court.  It is well settled that  equal  pay  must  depend
upon the nature of work done.  It cannot be judged by the mere volume of work,
there may be qualitative difference as regards reliability and responsibility.
Functions may  be  the  same  but the responsibilities made a difference.  One
cannot deny that often the difference is a matter of degree and that there  is
an  element of value judgment by those who are charged with the administration
in fixing the scales of pay and other conditions of service.  So long as  such
value  judgment  is  made  bona  fide, reasonably on an intelligible criterion
which  has  a  rational  nexus  with  the  object  of  differentiation,   such
differentiation will  not  amount  to  discrimination.    The principle is not
always easy to apply as there  are  inherent  difficulties  in  comparing  and
evaluating  the  work done by different persons in different organizations, or
even in the same organisation.   Differentiation  in  pay  scales  of  persons
holding  same  posts and performing similar work on the basis of difference in
the degree of responsibility, reliability and confidentiality would be a valid
differentiation.  The judgment of administrative  authorities  concerning  the
responsibilities  which  attach  to  the  post,  and the degree of reliability
expected to an incumbent,  would  be  a  value  judgment  of  the  authorities
concerned  which,  if arrived at bona fide, reasonably and rationally, was not
open to interference by the Court."
</p>
<p id="p_39">In para 9, the Court held that,

        "9?  The person who asserts that there is equality has  to  prove  it.
The equality  is  not based on designation or the nature of work alone.  There
are several other factors like, responsibilities,  reliabilities,  experience,
confidentiality  involved,  functional need and requirements commensurate with
the position in the hierarchy, the qualifications required which  are  equally
relevant."
</p>
<p id="p_40">Para 11 of the judgement is also relevant:
</p>
<p id="p_41">"11.  In the case of <a href="/doc/1877922/" id="a_12">State of U.P.  v.  J.P.  Chaurasia</a> [1989 (1 ) SCC 121] it
was  pointed  out  that  whether two posts are equal or should carry the equal
pay, depends on several factors.  It was  not  depend  just  upon  either  the
nature of  work  or  the  volume  of  work  done.  Primarily it requires among
others, evaluation of duties and responsibilities of the respective  posts  by
the  Competent  Authorities  constituted  for  the  purpose  and Courts cannot
ordinately substitute themselves in the  place  of  those  authorities.    The
quantity of  work  may  be  the  same  but the quality may be different.  That
cannot be determined by relying upon averments  in  affidavits  of  interested
parties.   It must be determined by expert bodies like Pa y Commission and the
Government, who would be the best Judges, to  evaluate  the  nature  of  duty,
responsibility and  all relevant factors.  The same view was reiterated in the
case of <a href="/doc/1176691/" id="a_13">State of M.P.  v.  Pramod Bhartiya</a> [1993 (1) SCC 539] by a three-Judge
Bench of this Court.  In the case of <a href="/doc/1993685/" id="a_14">Shyam Babu Verma v.  Union of India</a> [1994
(2) SCC 521] a claim for equal pay by a  group  of  Pharmacists  was  rejected
saying  that the classification made by a body of experts after full study and
analysis of the work, should not be disturbed except for strong reasons  which
indicate that the classification made was unreasonable."
</p>
<p id="p_42">        15.   From the materials furnished by the Department, we are satisfied
that the post of Electrician in the Rural Development Department is sanctioned
with the scale of Rs.950-1500 on par with that of trade post, namely, Grade II
and that there is no Grade I trade post in that department.  We  have  already
referred to  the  fact that in G.O.Ms.No.  468 Finance dated 31-8-98, scale of
pay was revised only to Grade I post and not Grade II.  We  also  referred  to
qualification,  nature  of  work  being  performed in TWAD Board as well as in
Rural Development Department.  As stated in (2002) 6 Supreme Court Cases 72  ( 
cited  supra),  though  the Department failed to place all the above mentioned
relevant facts before the Tribunal, it is the bounden duty of the Tribunal  to
consider  the  averments  in the petition filed by the Association on its true
merits before issuing such positive direction.  Even in the application  filed
before  the  Tribunal,  the  Association has not highlighted their entitlement
except referring to G.O.Ms.No.  51 1, Finance Department, dated  1-8-92.    We
are  satisfied that the Tribunal has committed an error in not considering all
the relevant materials.

Administrative Tribunal dated 11-6-2002 made in  O.A.No.    1507  of  2001  is
quashed and the Writ Petition is allowed.  No costs.
