[Arising out of S. L. P. (C) No.5536 of 2005]



LOKESHWAR SINGH PANTA, J.
</p>

<p id="p_2">1.	Special leave granted.
</p><p id="p_3">2.	This appeal, by special leave, has been preferred by Ram 
Sunder Ram (appellant herein) against the judgment and order 
dated 10.12.2004 of a Division Bench of the High Court of 
Calcutta by which M.A.T. No.2856 of 1997 filed by the Union 
of India and Others (respondents herein) was allowed and the 
judgment and order dated 07.08.1997 of a learned Single 
Judge, allowing the Writ Petition (C.O. No.12843 (W) No.1991) 
filed by the appellant, was set aside.
</p><p id="p_4">3.	The appellant filed writ petition in the High Court of 
Calcutta for setting aside the order of discharge from the Army 
Service passed by the Commander, 33 Corps Artillery Brigade 
(respondent No.5 in the present appeal) who was competent 
authority under Rule 13 of the Army Rules 1954. 
</p><p id="p_5">4.	The learned Single Judge allowed the writ petition inter 
alia on the ground that the principles of natural justice have 
not been followed by the competent authority while passing 
the order of discharge.  
</p><p id="p_6">5.	The respondents then preferred writ appeal before the 
Division Bench of the High Court, which allowed the same by 
the judgment and order impugned by the appellant in this 
appeal before us.
</p><p id="p_7">6.	On 26.09.1980, the appellant was appointed as Cleaner 
in ClassIV with the Indian Armed Forces.  On 23.09.1983, he 
became LDC in the Army establishment.  On 03.07.1988, the 
appellant was deputed to perform the duties of Petrol, Oil and 
Lubricants (POL) Clerk.  On 09.08.1988, the competent 
authority ordered convening of the court of inquiry based upon 
certain anonymous complaints, on the following issues:
A. Investigating the circumstances, under 
which quantity 70 KL of 70 MT Gas issued to 
5033 ASC Battalion against IOC installation, 
New Jalpaiguri, has not been received by the 
Unit and pinpoints the responsibility for the 
loss.
</p>
<p id="p_8">B.  To scrutinize the records for the last two 
years and also to examine the procedure 
being followed for receipt, demand, collection 
and accounting the issue of POL in the 
operation of Kerbside Pump. 
</p>
<p id="p_9">C.	 To indicate loopholes and suggest remedy 
and measures.
</p>
<p id="p_10">D.	 To indicate losses other than those 
mentioned in the order.  

</p><p id="p_11">7.	 The court of inquiry deliberations was held by the 
authority between the period commencing from 16.08.1988 
and 12.12.1988.  On 06.10.1988, the appellant was detained 
for interrogation under custody.  During interrogation, the 
appellant made confessional statement of receiving illegal 
money of Rs. 12,500/- from one Shri Rajendra Singh, owner of 
Pansari Shop, for sale of 87 MT Gas through BPLs and 
Kerbside Pump, kept by Dvr. Gde 11 Ramakant Prasad of A 
Coy 5033 ASC Bn (MT).  The appellant later on deposited Rs. 
5,200/- out of Rs.12,500/-.  
</p><p id="p_12">8.	The court of inquiry was completed and on 24.08.1988 
the enquiry report was submitted to the competent authority.  
</p><p id="p_13">9.	The appellant, having been found guilty of prejudicial 
act to good order and military discipline, was charged under 
<a href="/doc/348987/" id="a_1">Section 63</a> of the Army Act, 1950 [for short the <a href="/doc/165229/" id="a_2">Army Act</a>].  
On 08.08.1989, Major H. S. Dhillon, Presiding Officer, 
Summary of Evidence, sent a letter to the appellant and LDC 
J.P. Singh directing them to be present on 9th August, 1989 at 
1000 Hrs. for recording summary evidence.  The evidence was 
collected by the court of inquiry against the appellant and 
some other Army Officials.  On 03.07.1991, the appellant was 
informed by respondent No. 5 that while working with A Coy 
5033 ASC Bn (MT), the appellant received Rs. 12,500/- as 
illegal money from Shri Rajendra Singh, owner of Pansari shop 
and converted the said amount to self use, well knowing it to 
be from sale of 87 MT Gas through BPLs and Kerbside Pump, 
kept by Dvr. Gde 11 Ramakant Prasad of A Coy 5033 ASC Bn 
(MT).   He was, therefore, asked to show cause within 15 days 
of the receipt of the notice as to why his services should not be 
terminated for the lapse committed by him.  After the 
appellant showed cause on 13.08.1991 which was found 
unsatisfactory, the respondent No.5 discharged him from 
service on 09.09.1991.  
</p><p id="p_14">10.	The appellant challenged the order of discharge from 
service in the High Court of Calcutta.  The learned Single 
Judge, as stated above, set aside the said order of discharge 
inter alia on the ground of violation of the principles of natural 
justice and directed the respondents to reinstate the appellant 
with 25% of his arrear salaries as per the last pay drawn.  
Further, it was observed that the Army Authority was not 
prevented from taking appropriate steps against the appellant 
in accordance with law, if they so advised and technicalities 
alone ought not to stand in the way in that regard.  In writ 
appeal, the order of the learned Single Judge came to be set 
aside by a Division Bench of the High Court and the Writ 
Petition filed by the appellant was accordingly dismissed.
</p><p id="p_15">11.	Hence, this appeal by the appellant.
</p><p id="p_16">12.	Capt. K. S. Bhati, learned counsel appearing for the 
appellant, argued as a question of law that the order of 
removing the appellant from service was vitiated being 
contrary to <a href="/doc/348987/" id="a_3">Section 63</a> of the Army Act, which provides for 
imposing any kind of punishment only after conviction by 
court-martial.  He contended that the proceedings of the court 
of inquiry have been used as evidence against the appellant 
contrary to Rule 12 of the Army Rules, 1954 [hereinafter 
referred to as the Army Rules] as no discharge certificate 
required to be furnished under the provisions of <a href="/doc/1175180/" id="a_4">Section 23</a> of 
the Army Act was prepared and sent to the appellant.
</p><p id="p_17">13.	It was argued for the appellant that the court of 
inquiry, acting under the Army Rules, collects evidence during 
fact finding proceedings and no one is accused or charged of 
any offence in that proceedings.  It was argued that the 
evidence collected during court of inquiry is not admissible 
against the appellant in view of <a href="/doc/348987/" id="a_5">Section 63</a> of the Army Act 
under which the case should have been remanded for trial by 
court-martial as was done in the case of other army personnel, 
who were dealt with by court-martial and they were retained in 
service by imposing minor punishment upon them whereas 
the appellant was discharged from service, as a result thereof 
his entire past service has been forfeited and he has been 
deprived of the benefit of pension as also future employment 
in any other civil service.  The learned counsel contended that 
the appellant was administratively discharged from service 
contrary to the provisions of <a href="/doc/348987/" id="a_6">Section 63</a> and there is no 
provision to impose major penalty in the form of termination of 
service of the appellant by the respondent No.5 under the 
guise of discharge from service in exercise of power under 
<a href="/doc/1939328/" id="a_7">Section 20</a> of the Army Act.
</p><p id="p_18">14.	Mr. Vikas Singh, learned ASG appearing for the 
respondents, on the other hand, made submissions to support 
the judgment of the Division Bench of the High Court.  He 
contended that the well reasoned judgment of the Division 
Bench does not suffer from any infirmity or perversity, 
warranting interference by this Court.  He contended that the 
authority empowered under Rule 13 of the Army Rules has 
passed the order of discharge simpliciter under <a href="/doc/302971/" id="a_8">Section 22</a> of 
the Army Act and <a href="/doc/1939328/" id="a_9">Section 20</a> appears to have been wrongly 
mentioned by the authority in the order of discharge.    
</p><p id="p_19">15.	We have given our thoughtful and anxious 
consideration to the respective contentions of the parties and 
have perused the entire material on record.  
</p><p id="p_20">16.	It is an admitted case of the parties that the appellant 
is governed by the provisions of the <a href="/doc/165229/" id="a_10">Army Act</a> and the Army 
Rules framed thereunder.  The scheme of the <a href="/doc/165229/" id="a_11">Army Act</a> is fairly 
clear.  Chapter IV of the Act deals with Conditions of Service of 
persons subject to the <a href="/doc/165229/" id="a_12">Army Act</a>.  
</p><p id="p_21">17.	<a href="/doc/1939328/" id="a_13">Section 20</a> of the Act deals with dismissal, removal or 
reduction by the Chief of the Army Staff and by other officers.  
<a href="/doc/1445586/" id="a_14">Section 191</a> of the Act empowers the Central Government to 
make rules for the purpose of carrying into effect the 
provisions of the <a href="/doc/165229/" id="a_15">Army Act</a>.   In exercise of the said power, the 
Central Government has framed the rules called The Army 
Rules, 1954.  Chapter III of the Army Rules deals with 
dismissal, discharge, etc.   Chapter V of the Army Rules deals 
with investigation of charges and trial by court-martial.  Rule 
13 tabulates the category of the Army official, causes/grounds 
of discharge, the authorities competent to pass the order of 
discharge and the manner of discharge.
</p><p id="p_22">18. 	 It is not in dispute that the appellant has been 
discharged under Rule 13 column 2 (v) of the Table below sub-
rule (3) on the grounds of all other classes of discharge by 
Brigade/Sub-Area Commander who, admittedly, was 
competent authority to authorize discharge of the appellant.  
Column 4 of the Table provides manner of discharge, which 
reads as under: 
</p><p id="p_23">The Brigade or Sub-Area Commander 
before ordering the discharge shall, if the 
circumstances of the case permit give to 
the person whose discharge is 
contemplated an opportunity to show 
cause against the contemplated 
discharge.     
</p>

<p id="p_24">19.	 The order of discharge of the appellant from the Army 
service has been passed by the competent authority under 
<a href="/doc/302971/" id="a_16">Section 22</a> of the Army Act read with Rule 13 on the grounds 
covered under column (2)(v) of the Table, after affording 
adequate opportunity to him of showing cause before the said  
order of discharge came to be passed.  We are, however, 
satisfied on the material placed before us that the court of 
inquiry was formed under Rule 177 of the Army Rules and the 
purpose of court of inquiry was to collect the evidence for the 
information of superior officers to make up their mind about 
the involvement of the appellant and the other army officials in 
the racket of clandestine sale of petrol.  In the court of inquiry, 
the appellant was heard and was given proper and adequate 
opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses, which he did not 
choose to avail.  The respondents, in Para 20 of the counter 
affidavit filed in opposition to the writ petition before the High 
Court, have made categorical statement that in the court of 
inquiry the appellant was given full opportunity to defend his 
case and to cross-examine the witnesses who appeared and 
deposed before the Recording Officer, but the appellant was 
just sitting throughout the proceedings and did not avail the 
opportunity of cross-examining the witnesses.  The appellant 
has not denied this assertion of the respondents in the 
rejoinder affidavit.
</p><p id="p_25">20.	  As noticed above, the appellant had shown cause vide 
reply dated 13.08.1991 (Annexure P6) to the show cause 
notice dated 03.07.1991 (Annexure P5) issued to him by 
respondent No.5.   The competent authority considered the 
reply of the appellant in right perspective and found the same 
not satisfactory.  Therefore, on 09.09.1991, the competent 
authority passed the order of discharge (Annexure P7) of the 
appellant from the army service with immediate effect in 
exercise of the power under <a href="/doc/1939328/" id="a_17">Section 20</a> of the Army Act.  It 
appears that the competent authority has wrongly quoted 
<a href="/doc/1939328/" id="a_18">Section 20</a> in the order of discharge whereas, in fact, the order 
of discharge has to be read having been passed under <a href="/doc/302971/" id="a_19">Section 
22</a> of the Army Act.  It is well settled that if an authority has a 
power under the law merely because while exercising that 
power the source of power is not specifically referred to or a 
reference is made to a wrong provision of law, that by itself 
does not vitiate the exercise of power so long as the power does 
exist and can be traced to a source available in law [see N. 
Mani v. Sangeetha Theatre &amp; Ors.  (2004) 12 SCC 278].    
Thus, quoting of wrong provision of <a href="/doc/1939328/" id="a_20">Section 20</a> in the order of 
discharge of the appellant by the competent authority does not 
take away the jurisdiction of the authority under <a href="/doc/302971/" id="a_21">Section 22</a> of 
the Army Act. Therefore, the order of discharge of the 
appellant from the army service cannot be vitiated on this sole 
ground as contended by the learned counsel for the appellant.  
A plain reading of the order of discharge shows that it is an 
order of termination of service simpliciter without casting or 
attaching any stigma to the conduct of the appellant, therefore 
the said order cannot be termed to be punitive in nature or 
prejudicial to the future employment of the appellant in getting 
employment in civil service.  Thus, the contention of the 
learned counsel for the appellant that the order of discharge is 
punitive in nature does not merit acceptance. 
</p><p id="p_26">21.	  The Division Bench of the High Court has noticed the 
decisions of this Court relied upon by the appellant in the 
cases of <a href="/doc/395581/" id="a_22">Ex. Naik Sardar Singh v. Union of India &amp; Ors</a>. [AIR 
1992 SC 417], <a href="/doc/262020/" id="a_23">Major Suresh Chand Mehta v. The Defence 
Secretary (U.O.I</a>.) &amp; Ors. [AIR 1991 SC 483], Lt. Col. <a href="/doc/278740/" id="a_24">Prithi Pal 
Singh Bedi v. Union of India &amp; Ors</a>. [AIR 1982 SC 1413] and <a href="/doc/129840776/" id="a_25">S. 
N. Mukherjee v. Union of India</a> [(1990) 4 SCC 594].  In the said 
decisions, this Court has dealt with the matter of imposition of 
punishment on Army officials who were subjected to court-
martial proceedings.  In S. N. Mukherjees case (supra), this 
Court was dealing with the requirement of recording of 
reasons by an authority exercising quasi-judicial function, 
besides challenge to the court-martial proceedings.  Reliance 
was placed on Paragraph 13 of the judgment of this Court in 
the case of Major Suresh Chand Mehta (supra).  In that case, 
this Court held that the court of inquiry, as provided under 
Rule 177 of the Army Rules, is merely held for the purpose of 
collecting evidence and if so required, to report in regard to 
any matter which may be referred to the officers and such an 
inquiry is for the purpose of a preliminary investigation and 
cannot be equated with a trial or court-martial.  All the above 
cited decisions are of no assistance to the appellant in the 
peculiar facts of the case on hand.  We are satisfied that there 
is ample evidence on record in support of the judgment and 
order of the Division Bench of the High Court and there is 
nothing that would justify this Court interfering with it.  
Therefore, the above arguments of the appellant are 
unacceptable to us. 
</p><p id="p_27">22. 	 For the reasons discussed above, the appeal is devoid of 
merit and it is, accordingly, dismissed.  The judgment and 
order of the Division Bench is affirmed.  The parties, however, 
are left to bear their own costs.
