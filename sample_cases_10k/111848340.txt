JUDGEMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">       Vide this judgement, I shall decide the petition U/s 125 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_1">Cr.P.C</a>. for

grant   of   maintenance   moved   by   petitioners   wherein   it   is   stated   that

petitioner   no.   1   got   married   to   the   respondent  on   08­04­1996   as   per

Hindu Rites and Customs at H. No. D­247, Nand Nagari, Delhi - 93 and

the   parents   of   petitioner   no.   1   had   spent   normal   amount   on   the   said

marriage beyond their capacity. It has been stated that out of the said

wedlock, a male child namely Ashish / petitioner no. 6 was born and the

petitioner nos. 2 to   5 were born from the wedlock of petitioner no. 1

with her previous husband, who had expired in the year, 1996 and the

said fact was disclosed to the respondent before the marriage. It has been

stated that at the time of marriage, the respondent was unemployed but

after sometime he joined Delhi Police as Constable bearing no. 1186C

and the respondent is posted under the DCP, Darya Ganj, Delhi. It has

been alleged that sometime, the respondent stopped coming home and

told   that   he   was   busy   in   his   training,   after   passing   one   week,   the

petitioner no. 1 went to Darya Ganj Police Station where she came to

know   that   the   respondent   has   solemnized   second   marriage   and   a

marriage card was shown to the petitioner no. 1 regarding the marriage

of the respondent. On that day, petitioner no. 1 came back to her house

and told the story to her landlord and the landlord advised the petitioner

no. 1 to call the Panchayat. On 15­11­2002, the petitioner no. 1 called the

Panchayat   against   the   respondent   at   Pramhans   Vihar,   Laxmi   Garden,


CASE NO. 408/04                                                              P........2/8
 Delhi   where   the   respondent   admitted   that   he   had   remarried   with   one

Babita   @   Munesh   and   the   respondent   will   fulfill   the   needs   of   the

petitioner no.1 and all children by paying Rs.2,000/­ p.m. as maintenance

and a built house  for petitioner no.1 and if he fails to fulfill the said

demand, the petitioner no. 1 can take legal action against the respondent

but the respondent did not fulfill the said demand and the petitioner no. 1

made a written complaint on 28­11­2002 to the DCP, Darya Ganj. It has

been   averred   that   the   respondent   has   neglected   and   deserted   the

petitioners and he has also refused to pay the maintenance despite the

several requests from 15­11­2002. It has been stated that the petitioner

no. 1 is an illiterate lady and she has no source of income and she is

totally dependent upon her mother and brothers and the petitioner nos. 2

to   6   are  minor   children.  It has  been claimed  that  the respondent  is a

Constable in Delhi Police and getting Rs.8,000/­ p.m. and the respondent

is also having agricultural land and household property in his village and

as   such   maintenance   amount   @Rs.5,000/­p.m.   for   the   petitioners   is

prayed. 
</p>
<p id="p_2">2.     Reply  has been filed wherein the respondent  has stated that the

petitioners   have   not   come   to   this   court   with   clean   hands   and   has

suppressed material facts from this court and the petitioners have abused

the process of law by filing the present petition on false and concocted

facts as such the petition is liable to be dismissed. The respondent has

denied having solemnized any marriage with the petitioner no. 1 as per

Hindu Rites and Customs. The respondent has also denied the allegations

made in the petition. The respondent has admitted that he is employed as

 a Constable in Delhi Police and is posted under the DCP, Darya Ganj,

Delhi. 
</p>
<p id="p_3">3.     The petitioners have preferred replication wherein the assertions to

the contrary have been controverted and has reiterated the facts stated in

the petition. 
</p>
<p id="p_4">4.     The petitioner no. 1 has examined herself as PW1 and has tendered

her   evidence   by   way   of   affidavit,   which   is   Ex.PW1/A   bearing   her

signatures at point A &amp; B. In support of her oral testimony, the petitioner

no. 1 has relied upon the documents such as statement, which is Mark­

PW1/A, Photographs, which is Ex.PW1/1, School certificate, which is

Ex.PW1/2,   copy   of   Panchayat   Faisla,   which   is   Ex.PW1/3,   copy   of

complaint dated 28­11­2002, which is Ex.PW1/4. The petitioner no.1 has

also examined ASI Ram Avtar, as PW2. On 04­05­2010, despite repeated

calls since morning, none appeared on behalf of the respondent and the

respondent's evidence was closed. 
</p>
<p id="p_5">5.     I have heard the Ld. Counsel for the petitioners and perused the

record with his assistance. None appeared on behalf of the respondent  to

address final arguments.       
</p>
<p id="p_6">6.     In   order   to   decide   the   claim   of   maintenance   the   following   are

required to be proved:

<p id="p_7">a.     relationship   with   the   respondent   Wife/child/father/mother   as   the

case may be,

b.     the ground for her residing separately, which should be reasonable

and sufficient to make her entitled for the relief,  

c.     the factum of neglect on behalf of the respondent,


CASE NO. 408/04                                                            P........4/8
 d.     incapability of petitioner to survive on her own and capability of

respondent to make provision for the maintenance.
</p>
<p id="p_8">(a)    The petitioner no. 1 has stated that she married the respondent on

08­04­1996 and out of the said wedlock, Master Ashish / petitioner no.

6was   born.   In   his   reply   the   respondent   has   denied   solemnization   of

marriage with the petitioner no. 1. The petitioner no. 1 / PW1 in her cross

examination has denied the suggestion that she never got married with

the respondent. It is an admitted case of the parties that the respondent is

employed as Constable in Delhi Police. PW1 stated in her examination in

chief that on 28­11­2002, she made a complaint to DCP, Darya Ganj,

against the respondent regarding bigamy  and  inquiry has been initiated

on her complaint Ex.PW1/4. PW1 has also deposed in her examination in

chief that the respondent  admitted the solemnization of marriage with

petitioner no. 1 and birth of petitioner no. 6 in his statement dated 11­12­

2002 Mark­PW1/2  made, during  vigilance  inquiry proceedings.  In the

cross examination of the petitioner no. 1, no question or suggestion has

been put to her that no such alleged admission has been made by the

respondent. The petitioner no. 1 has also examined ASI Ram Avtar as

PW2   and   he   had   brought   the   departmental   report   of   enquiry   from

Vigilance Department in regard of statement of respondent dated 11­12­

2002 Mark­PW1/2  and stated that the said statement  is signed by the

respondent. The respondent did not prefer to cross examine PW2. PW2

has duly proved the statement Mark­PW1/A wherein the respondent has

himself admitted solemnization of marriage with petitioner no. 1 as per

Hindu   Rites   &amp;   Customs   and   Ashish   /   petitioner   no.   6   being   his   son.

</p><p id="p_9">CASE NO. 408/04                                                              P........5/8
 Further the respondent has not led evidence in rebuttal so as to dispute

the relationship. Hence, the petitioner no. 1 has successfully established

her   relationship   of   a   legally   wedded   wife   with   the   respondent   and

petitioner no. 6 namely Ashish being the son of the respondent.

</p><p id="p_10">       As regards petitioner no. 2 to 5, the petitioner no. 1 has herself

stated that they were born from her previous husband, therefore, they are

not entitled to claim maintenance from the respondent. 

</p><p id="p_11">(b) &amp; (c)     Regarding   the   ground   for   residing   separate   from   the

respondent, the petitioner no. 1 / PW1 has stated that the respondent has

solemnized the second marriage and has deserted the petitioner no. 1. In

the cross examination of PW1, a suggestion has been put to her that the

respondent is married to Ms. Manju and he is residing with her which

amounts   to   an   admission   by   the   respondent   that   he   has   solemnized

second   marriage.   The   respondent   has   not   claimed   to   have   made   any

arrangement for the maintenance of petitioner no. 1 and petitioner no. 6

during the period of separation. In view of the above, it is established on

record that the petitioner no. 1 has sufficient reasons to reside separately

as   she   has   been   deserted   by   the   respondent   and   the   respondent   has

neglected to maintain the petitioner no. 1 and petitioner no. 6.

</p><p id="p_12">(d)    As regards the incapability of petitioners to survive on their own,

the petitioner no. 1 / PW1 has deposed that she is an illiterate lady and

she   has   no   source   of   income.   The   petitioner   no.   1   in   her   cross

examination has stated that she is doing sweeping work in 5­6 houses

and monthly expenditure of her house is Rs.5,000/­ which is borne by her

by doing sweeping work and with the help of her parents. The petitioner


CASE NO. 408/04                                                           P........6/8
 no. 1 cannot be expected to maintain herself and petitioner no. 6 decently

and   with   dignity   by   merely   doing   household   work   in   5­6   household.

Further, the petitioner no. 1 also has the liability to maintain petitioner

nos. 2 to 5 born from her previous husband, who has expired. The wife

and   the   children   are   entitled   to   the   same   status   as   enjoyed   by   the

husband. It is an admitted case of the parties that the respondent  is a

Constable   in   Delhi   Police.   In   the   absence   of   any   material   on   record,

considering the nature of employment of the respondent, the respondent

is presumed to be earning Rs.16,000/­ to Rs.18,000/­ p.m. The present

petition was filed by petitioner no.1 on behalf of herself and five minor

children  in  the year  2004 and has claimed maintenance  @ Rs.5,000/­

p.m.   for   the   petitioners   i.e.   approximately   Rs.833/­   p.m.   for   each

petitioner. As observed above, the petitioner nos. 2 to 5 being born from

previous   husband   of   the   petitioner   no.   1   are   not   entitled   to   claim

maintenance from the respondent.  In case titled as Kamaldeep Kaur &amp;

Anr Vs. Balwinder Singh 2005 (3) RCR (Crl.) 258, the Hon'ble Supreme

Court has observed that u/s 125 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_2">Cr.P.C</a>. it is the duty of the Magistrate to

provide   just   maintenance   to   the   deserted   wife   or   destitute   wife.   The

amount of maintenance should be such that a wife is able to maintain

herself decently and with dignity. If, after considering the material placed

before   the   Magistrate,   the   Magistrate   is   of   the   view   that   a   particular

amount is reasonable amount, he is required to award the said amount as

maintenance   and   in   my   opinion,   he   cannot   refuse   to   grant   the   said

amount merely because, the claimant has not claimed such an amount in

her application. Once the legislation has cast duty on the court to award


CASE NO. 408/04                                                               P........7/8
 just   and   reasonable   amount   of   maintenance   in   the   facts   and

circumstances   of   a   case,   the   same   cannot   be   denied   on   mere

technicalities.  
</p>
<p id="p_13">       In   the   present   case   though   the   petitioners   have   claimed

maintenance @ Rs.833/­ p.m. for each petitioner, the said amount is not

sufficient  as the petitioner no. 6 is of tender age and petitioner  no. 1

merely being a maid cannot provide proper education to petitioner no. 6

and cannot even sustain herself if, only maintenance amount of Rs.833/­

p.m. as prayed is awarded. Further, the respondent is earning not less

than  earning Rs.16,000/­ to Rs.18,000/­ p.m. and the wife and the child

are entitled to the same standard of living as enjoyed by the husband.

Hence, it is a fit case for awarding maintenance amount more than the

amount claimed in the present petition.   
</p>
<p id="p_14">       Keeping in view the foregoing reasons and discussion, the petition

is   accordingly   decreed   with   direction   to   respondent   to   make   an

arrangement @ Rs.4,000/­ per month in favour of petitioner no. 1 and @

Rs.3,000/­ per month in favour of petitioner no. 6 from the date of filing

of the present petition (Rs.7,000/­ to be paid by the respondent to the

petitioner no. 1 and petitioner no. 6).  The present petition is dismissed

qua petitioner nos. 2 to 5. The amounts if received by the petitioner nos.1

&amp; petitioner no. 6 subsequent to any orders shall be adjusted.
