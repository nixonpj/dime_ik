<p id="p_1">2   22-11-2019                  Learned counsel for the petitioner is permitted to add

                   the Execution Munsif-cum-Election Tribunal, Bhojpur at Ara as

                   filed an application praying that the evidence of contesting

                   opposite party may be closed. The contesting opposite party

                   who is respondent no.4 here has filed list of 48 witnesses and

                     delaying the disposal of the election petition, it is for the

                     election tribunal to ensure that any attempt by any of the parties

                     to delay the disposal of the election petition on any frivolous

                     ground is required to be dealt with strictly and no unnecessary

                     adjournment may be granted in the case.
