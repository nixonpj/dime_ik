CORAM: HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE ASHWANI KUMAR SINGH
ORAL JUDGMENT
Date: 21-01-2016

               By the present application preferred under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_1">Section 482</a> of

   the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (For Short "<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_2">CrPC</a>"), the

   petitioner seeks quashing of the order dated 30.05.2014 passed by

   the learned Judicial Magistrate, 1st Class, Saran at Chhapra in G.R.

   No. 4200/12/Reg-33126/14 arising out of Rasulpur P. S. Case No.

   123 of 2012, whereby on receipt of a police report under <a href="/doc/1412034/" id="a_3">Section

   173</a> CrPC, cognizance of the offences punishable under <a href="/doc/1897847/" id="a_4">Sections

   120-B</a>, <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_5">302</a> and <a href="/doc/386021/" id="a_6">201</a> of the Indian Penal Code (for short "<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_7">IPC</a>") has

   been taken against the petitioner and he has been summoned to face

   trial.
</p>
<p id="p_5">               2.          It has been contended by the learned counsel for

   the petitioner that the sister of the informant was married to the
 Patna High Court Cr.Misc. No.24528 of 2015 dt.21-01-2016

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                           2/4</span>




        petitioner in the year 1990. In 2009, an ex parte divorce decree was

        passed by the learned Principal Judge, Deoria, Uttar Pradesh on the

        application filed by the petitioner and since then, he had no concern

        with the deceased, sister of the informant. He, however, concedes

        that the deceased had filed a maintenance case before the Principal

        Judge, Family Court, Saran at Chapra and vide order dated

        06.07.2010, the Family Court had directed the petitioner to pay ad

        interim maintenance of Rs.2000/- per month to the deceased and

        the same was being paid to her. It has further been contended that

        though the sister of the informant died in the village of the

        petitioner, but her death took place in the house of her sister, who

        has also been married to one Gorakhnath Singh in the same village

        and after 45 days of the death, the present case has been filed just in

        order to blackmail and harass the petitioner. It has also been

        contended that on the date of occurrence, the petitioner was at the

        place of his posting at Deoria and his involvement was found to be

        false by the police during investigation and as such, the police had

        rightly submitted a final report holding the case to be a mistake of

        fact.
</p>
<p id="p_6">                     3.          Per contra, learned counsel for informant has

        submitted that there is specific allegation in the complaint that after

        the decree of divorce and after the order for payment of ad-interim
 Patna High Court Cr.Misc. No.24528 of 2015 dt.21-01-2016

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                           3/4</span>




        maintenance, the petitioner approached the deceased and took her

        to her marital home and she was killed by him on the very next day.

        The delay caused in filing the complaint has also been explained in

        the complaint petition and in course of investigation, the informant

        has fully supported the case of the prosecution. It has further been

        contended that the prayer for grant of anticipatory bail of the

        petitioner was also rejected by this Court vide order dated

        03.11.2015 passed in Cr. Misc. No. 46001 of 2015, but he has not

        appeared before the court below till date. He has further contended

        that in the case-diary, apart from the informant, other brothers of

        the deceased, namely, Vishan Singh and Triguna Singh have also

        supported the case of the informant and in that view of the matter,

        the learned Magistrate has rightly differed with the police report

        and took cognizance of the offence punishable under <a href="/doc/1439698/" id="a_8">Sections 120-</a>

        B, 302 and 201 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_9">IPC</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_7">                     4.          I have heard learned respective counsels for the

        parties and perused the record, I find that though there is some

        delay in institution of the complaint, which was sent to the police

        under <a href="/doc/99487/" id="a_10">Section 156(3)</a> CrPC, the cause of delay has been properly

        explained in the complaint. The allegations made in the FIR are

        quite serious. The informant and his brothers have supported the

        allegations made in the complaint. In that view of the matter, no

                illegality can be found in the impugned order passed by the Court

                below.
</p>
<p id="p_8">                             5.          Accordingly, the application, being devoid any

                merit, is hereby dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_9">                             6.          However, it would be open for the petitioner to

                raise all the points available to him at the stage of framing of

                charge.
