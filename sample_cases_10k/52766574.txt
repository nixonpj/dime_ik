Honble Mr. Justice Ajit Singh
Honble Mr. Justice  Anupinder Singh Grewal

Mr.Anil Mehta for the appellants.
Mr.Rajendra Prasad, Addl.Advocate General for the State-respondents.</pre>

<p id="p_1">The following order of the Court was passed by 
Ajit Singh, J.
</p><p id="p_2">	This bunch of intra court appeals is directed against the interim order dated 24.09.2014 passed by the learned Single Judge of this High Court, whereby she has dismissed the applications for stay on merits. 
</p><p id="p_3">	The appellants in their respective S.B.Civil Writ Petitions, have challenged the land acquisition proceedings initiated under the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_1">Land Acquisition Act</a>, 1894 (for short, '1894 Act') by seeking prayer for quashing the notifications issued under <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_2">Sections 4</a>, <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_3">6</a> and <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_4">9A</a>. The appellants have also challenged the validity of respective awards dated 11.09.2008 and 31.07.2008 passed under the 1894 Act. 
</p><p id="p_4">	The lands in question have been acquired by the State Government at the behest of Jaipur Development Authority for the purpose of constructing the Ring Road and developed Corridor.
</p><p id="p_5">	The learned Single Judge after discussing the facts and grounds argued in detail, by the impugned interim order has dismissed all the applications for stay. The operative part of the order reads as follows:-
</p><p id="p_6">15. In the aforesaid premises, the court is of the opinion that the petitioners have failed to establish any prima facie case for the grant of interim relief, and the balance of convenience also tilts in favour of the respondents. The petitioners could be compensated in terms of money as per the Act of 2013, if they ultimately succeed in the petitions. However if the interim relief claimed is granted it would cause irreparable loss to the respondents and the public at large. In that view of the matter, all the applications are dismissed.
</p><p id="p_7">	It is stated at the Bar that the bunch of main petitions is being heard on day to day basis by the learned Single Judge. As the bunch of main petitions is being heard on priority basis by the learned Single Judge, it is expected and hoped that the same will be finally decided on an early date. The only apprehension of the appellants is that since the learned Single Judge has already dismissed their prayer for stay with findings against them, their main petitions will also be dismissed. We are however, of the view that such an apprehension of the appellants is misplaced because the finding of the learned Single Judge, while dismissing the applications for stay is only that they prima facie failed to make out a case for interim relief. It is also expected and hoped that the learned Single Judge will decide the bunch of writ petitions on merits, and not having regard to her prima facie view.
</p><p id="p_8">	With the above observation, these appeals are dismissed.
</p>
