             was placed before a medical board of three members.                The medical

             petitioner must be actually put to test to see that he is fully capable of

             doing every practical activity of what would be necessary for any

             student to undertake during his course and without putting him through

             such practical test, the medical board cannot determine his medical

             fitness.

<p id="p_9">             3.                 As passionate as the argument is and as poignant the

             situation is, I still may not be able to make an intervention in favour of

             the petitioner to over-run a certificate issued by the medical board.

             The medical board is bound to know that they are examining the student

             for his suitability for being admitted to a particular course.      If no

             objective analysis of the report of the medical board is brought before

             me and an argument is placed on an emotional pitch that a handicapped

             person cannot be thrown out of college even without putting him

             through practical test, I may not still be able to make an intervention. I

             will limit my jurisdiction to examining whether the particular decision

             was taken by a person who was competent or not. If it was through a

             medical board which was composed of persons who were duly qualified,

             the judgment must rest there and the review through a judicial

             intervention cannot be possible.
