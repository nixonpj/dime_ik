                that, the petitioner is not residing on the given address

questions of facts. It may be open for the petitioner to take appropriate and
corrective steps in future for redressal of the grievance raised in this

make it clear that the rejection of this petition would not be construed to
mean that there is an impediment for the petitioner to take appropriate
steps for redressal of his grievance with the concerned authorities.
