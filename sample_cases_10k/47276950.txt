JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">1.                 In this suit for recovery of a sum of Rs.4,69,465/- the plaintiff
contends that he is in the avocation of contract works and supply of building
materials working with MCD on contract basis. He further alleges that a
tender was floated by the defendant and was awarded the work vide order
bearing no. 299 dated 02.09.2008 concerning the "P/f M/s Grating in New
Usmanpur and Gautam Puri Ward No. 251, Shahdara (N. Zone)".                             The
contract work was to be completed within two months and the amount
agreed was Rs.3,45,831/-.
</p><p id="p_2">2.                 The plaintiff started executing the works on 12.09.2008 and
completed within time. He requested the engineer concerned to inspect the
site and process the bills. The officials inspected, measured the work. The
defect liability period also expired and there was no complaint in the
execution of works. Inspite of this, the defendant did not pay the amounts.
</p>
<p id="p_3">C.S. No.836/<a href="/doc/156056635/" id="a_1">2016                    Sudhir Bhardwaj vs. MCD           Page No</a>. 1/7
 The plaintiff wrote several letters, met the officials R.K. Sharma and S.K.
Mittal also.        The bills were not cleared.               Complaint was made to anti-
corruption department and one R.K. Sharma was caught red handed
accepting bribe which is investigated in FIR No. 38/08. The plaintiff also
wrote a letter to the higher ups on 16.12.2008. Despite the best efforts the
defendant did not care to make the payments.
</p><p id="p_4">3.                 It is also averred that he approached the Hon'ble High Court for
appointment of an Arbitrator and the defendant contended therein that the
arbitration clause is deleted. Hence, the said petition was withdrawn.
</p><p id="p_5">4.                 It is further pleaded that the plaintiff has no other alternative
than to approach civil court after issuing the legal notice dated 26.05.2011
claiming the bills for the works done along with interest @ 13% which is the
suit amount. Hence, the suit. The suit is filed on 03.10.2011.
</p><p id="p_6">5.                 Upon the summons the defendant appeared and filed written
statement. It is contended that suit is bad for non compliance of legal notice
as required u/s 478 of the DMC Act. It is their submission that the plaintiff
did not carry out any works and there is no mention of entries in the
measurement book during the inspection.                        It is further denied that the
plaintiff started execution of the work and completed within time stipulated.
The defendant denied the carrying out of the works and the measurement
book still shows the work order lying blank. The other allegations of the
plaintiff meeting officials R.K. Sharma and S.K. Mittal is also denied. They
denied the raising of the bills. It is also denied that the plaintiff having
approached the Hon'ble High Court for the appointment of arbitrator. The
legal notice dated 26.05.2011 alleged to have been issued is also denied.
The awarding of the contract is admitted. The liability of the defendant is
also denied.
</p><p id="p_7">6.                 The replication is filed by the plaintiff reiterating the plaint
averments. The contention of the defendant about non execution of the
work is answered with the averment that during the progress of the work the

C.S. No.836/<a href="/doc/156056635/" id="a_2">2016                    Sudhir Bhardwaj vs. MCD              Page No</a>. 2/7
 defendants had collected work samples and were sent to test check. The
plaintiff contends that the test check reports are also filed along with the
suit.
</p><p id="p_8">7.                 Based on the pleadings, the Ld. Predecessor of this court had
framed the following three issues by an order dated 14.12.2012.
</p><p id="p_9">        1. Whether the plaintiff is entitled to a decree of recovery of
        Rs.4,69,465/- with interest @ 13% per annum?OPD

</p><p id="p_10">        2. Whether the plaintiff has no cause of action to file the
        present suit?
</p>
<p id="p_11">        3. Relief.
</p>
<p id="p_12">8.                 In order to establish their respective contentions, the plaintiff
examined himself as PW-1.                   He did not submit for further cross
examination. By an order dated 15.02.2017, the PE was closed and the
matter was taken up for DE. On behalf of the defendants one witness is
examined and the evidence is closed.
</p><p id="p_13">9.                 Thereafter the plaintiff remained absent and court notice was
issued vide order dated 20.01.2018. One proxy counsel appeared
consequent to the court notice on 28.09.2018 and he was unable to
respond to the submissions made by the Ld. Counsel for the defendant that
they came to know that the plaintiff expired. However, the matter was kept
for further hearing and to take steps by 27.10.2018. On that day also the
proxy counsel had sought for time for taking appropriate steps and the
matter was adjourned to 04.01.2019. Thereafter none appeared for the
plaintiff and steps were not taken. Since the suit is filed in the year 2011, it
serves no purpose to further adjourn the case and the matter was kept for
written arguments by the plaintiff after hearing the defendant's counsel. No
written arguments were filed nor the steps taken by the plaintiff. The case is
taken up for disposal based on the available oral and documentary
evidence. Thus the issues are being answered as under.
</p>
<p id="p_14">C.S. No.836/<a href="/doc/156056635/" id="a_3">2016                    Sudhir Bhardwaj vs. MCD      Page No</a>. 3/7
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1"> Issue No. 1 &amp; 2</span>
</p><p id="p_15">10.                Both these issues are taken up together. Though the onus to
prove issue no. 1 is mentioned as OPD in the order sheet dated
14.12.2012, this seems to be a typographical error and both the issues
based on the pleadings are obligated to be proved by the plaintiff. Plaintiff
examined himself as PW-1 and reiterated the plaint averments. In order to
show that he was awarded a contract work under work order no. 299 dated
02.09.2008 he had relied on Ex. PW1/A which is a photocopy.                   On
05.08.2013 when PW-1 was examined partly in chief, my Ld. Predecessor
had noted as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">       "now the Ld. Counsel for the plaintiff submits that he wants to
       summon the record from MCD and examine the witnesses on the
       date".
</blockquote><p id="p_16">Thus the work order is not placed on record. However, since the work order
is admitted by the defendants the same need not be proved. Plaintiff had
also relied on Ex. PW1/B to Ex. PW1/B-4 which are also certified copies
and the photocopies of the letters Mark A to D, copy of the FIR in Mark E,
the legal notice dated 25.05.2012 at Ex. PW1/C, the postal receipts Ex.
PW1/D, E and F, copies of the measurement book bearing no. 17107 at Ex.
PW1/G, the copy of the agreement at Ex. PW1/H. Since the work order is
admitted by the defendant, it cannot be said that the plaintiff has no cause
of action to file the suit. Therefore, the issue no. 2 stands answered in
favour of the plaintiff.
</p><p id="p_17">11.                Though the work order is admitted by the defendant, it is their
contention that the plaintiff has not completed the assigned work and that
the measurement book does not have any entries of having completed the
work by the plaintiff. PW-1 asserted that he completed the works. This
witness was cross examined partly on 19.02.2016. He admits in the cross
examination that he does not know whether measurement book no. 17107
was in respect of the work order bearing no. 299 or not. He had further

C.S. No.836/<a href="/doc/156056635/" id="a_4">2016                   Sudhir Bhardwaj vs. MCD     Page No</a>. 4/7
 volunteered that the measurement book remains in the possession of JE
concerned.          He also admits that any entries of the work done in the
measurement book would be countersigned by the contractor accepting the
notings. He admits that one R.K. Singh was the Jr. Engineer at the relevant
time and he cannot identify the signatures of R.K. Singh.
</p><p id="p_18">12.                The defendant examined one witness by name by Shrimandir
who is the Executive Engineer (M) IV of Shahdara North Zone. According
to him the plaintiff never started any work and the measurement book
17107 remains blank with no entries of work done. He reiterates that the
plaintiff had not carried out any work and that the officials were falsely
implicated in FIR No. 38/2008. The said R.K. Sharma against whom the
FIR was registered is acquitted in the criminal case which judgment is
produced and the criminal court had also noted that the plaintiff Sudhir
Bhardwaj failed to prove that the work was executed. Since the plaintiff was
in the habit of not completing the works after participating in the tender
process he was removed from the panel of contractors by an order dated
05.12.2014.
</p><p id="p_19">13.                The documentary evidence relied by the defendants are Ex.
DW1/1 which is the measurement book no. 17107, the copy of the judgment
in criminal case at Ex. DW1/2 and the photocopy of the order removing the
contractor from the panel.
</p><p id="p_20">14.                In view of the assertions by the defendant that the work was
not completed, it is obligated upon the plaintiff to prove that the work was
completed to the satisfaction of the defendants. The say of the defendant is
to be seen through the documents.                     The relevant document is the
measurement book which number 17107 is not in dispute. The plaintiff who
had submitted on 05.08.2013 that he would summon the record to prove the
work order and its completion, did not lead any evidence. However, the
documentary evidence at Ex. PW1/B to B4 are only the letters which are
later marked as Mark A to D. The copy of the FIR at Mark E also does not

C.S. No.836/<a href="/doc/156056635/" id="a_5">2016                  Sudhir Bhardwaj vs. MCD         Page No</a>. 5/7
 support that the work is completed.                     Ex. PW1/C to F are not the
measurement books.            The photocopy of measurement book is filed on
record bearing no. 17107.          The same is perused.          This runs for seven
pages. The same is marked as Ex. PW/G and also Ex. DW1/1. After
perusal of the same there is a clear cut noting that "all the pages of this MB
from serial no. 1 to 100 are blank."
</p><p id="p_21">15.                The plaintiff has not examined any other witnesses to show that
the works completed by him were deliberately not entered into the
measurement book bearing no. 17107. It was expected of the plaintiff to
have examined at least some of the workers or somebody associated with
the execution of the work. He has admitted in the cross examination that he
submitted one invoice of the cement to the department but does not
remember the date and the particulars thereof. He further admitted that he
cannot produce the copy of the said invoice to show that he had used the
cement.
</p><p id="p_22">16.                On the other hand the defendant who has examined its
executive engineer DW-1 Shrimandir is vehement on oath that the plaintiff
never started the work at any point of time. He had relied on the very
measurement book Ex. PW1/G (as Ex. DW1/1) and produce the original
which was returned. The measurement book being the vital document to
infer about the execution of the work whether completed or not and the
same being blank, it becomes very difficult for this court to hold that the
plaintiff had completed the works allotted to him under the work order
bearing no. 299 dated 02.09.2008. In view of the above, in the absence of
any corroborative evidence, the mere say of the plaintiff becoming a self
serving testimony cannot be treated as the plaintiff having proved the
completion of the works assigned to him under the contract. Therefore, the
issue no. 1 stands answered in the negative and against the plaintiff.
</p><p id="p_23">                   For the aforesaid reasons, the suit of the plaintiff stands
disposed of by the following:
