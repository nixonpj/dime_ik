                          C.R. No.487 of 2008
                    MAHENDRA MALI @ MALAKAR
                                Versus

<p id="p_1">3   28.04.2009             Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the deed of

                 gift in his favour which is under challenge by the plaintiff was earlier

                 called for from the registration office by the court. However, as the

                 deed had not been copied completely in the register of the registration

                 office, same was neither supplied to the petitioner nor was sent to the

                 court for taking it as evidence. The case was adjourned from time to

                 time to enable the petitioner to obtain the same, while the petitioner

                 examine his other witnesses in the suit. However, on 21.03.2007 there

                 was no parvi in time on behalf of the defendant petitioner and

                 therefore his evidence was closed. A petition for recall of the order has

                 also been rejected by the impugned order

                           Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that now the

                 registration office has supplied the document in original to him, which

                 he is in a position to produce in court for taking it on record as

                 evidence and for which he just wants to examine one formal witness

                 for proving the same and getting the same exhibited. He further

                 submits that since this document is the bone of contention between the

                 parties. In the interest of justice, it is only fit and proper that the

                 defendant petitioner should be allowed to bring that document in

                 original on record.
