<p id="p_1">     This appeal is by the accused in S.C. No. 45/2008

on the file of learned Presiding Officer, Fast Track

Court-I, Koppal, (hereinafter referred to as 'Trial Court'

for short).   The appellant-accused has challenged in

this appeal legality and correctness of the impugned

Judgment and Order of conviction dated 25. 11 .2009

    the legally wedded wife of the appellant accused herein

    is as under-

<p id="p_3">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">         a) The marriage of the deceased Smt. Jyothi. the
         daughter   of PWb     Smt.   Sharadamma,     was
         performed with the accused about 12 years prior
         to her death.  Of the said marriage, the deceased
         got two children viz., Pratap aqed about 4 years
         and Manjunath aged about 3 years.

<blockquote id="blockquote_2">         b) Since the past three months the accused was
         ill-treating the deceased by beating and abusing
         in connection with his demand for 3 to ?4 lakhs
         from the parents of the deceased on the ground
         that hc required the said money for purchasing a
         tractor.The deceased used to inform her parents
        about the said ill treatment. The could not meet
        the   said    demand.             Therefore,     the   accused
        continued to give the ill-treatment and he used to
        threaten her that he would kill her.</blockquote><p id="p_4">

</p><p id="p_5">        c) On 07.05.2008 at about 8.30 p.m. the deceased
        finished her dinner along with her children. At
        about 8.45 p.m. on that day the accused. who had
        gone out of the house, returned to the house and
        again picked up quarrel with the deceased
        demanding the said amount from her parents. 1-Ic

         she declined to do so.   Then he kicked                    and
         abuscd her saying that she should die. Then he
         took kerosene, poured it on her head and then lit
         firc to her person with intent to commit her
         murder.
</p>
<p id="p_6">         d) When she was set on                fire, she cried.      On
         hearing    the cry,     the       neighbours   viz., Tirupati
         (PW3)     and       Yamanoorappa       (PW4)   came      there,
         extinguished the fire and then took her to the
         hospital. It was about 9 p.m. on that day when
         the said incident occurred.             The deceased was
         admitted in the Government hospital at Kukanoor.

</p><p id="p_7">        e) After she was admitted in the said hospital, the
        P.S.l.(PW14)   came
                         .    there and     recorded    her
        statement (Ex.Pl2). Thereafter she was shifted to
        KIMS Hospital at Hubli for her further treatment.
        Unfortunately, she succumbed to the said injuries
        by about 4 a.m. on 08.05.2008.
</p>
<p id="p_8">

</p><p id="p_9">        3. On the basis of the said complaint, PW14,

    P.5.1. registered a case in Crime No. 46/2008 of the

    said P.S. against the accused for the offences under

    <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_4">Sections 498-A</a> and <a href="/doc/647828/" id="a_5">307</a> of l.P.C. and issued F.1.R.
 I

    accordingly      and    dispatched     the        same     to    the
    jurisdictional     Magistrate.     After    the    death    of   the
    deceased, the P.5.1. got the accusation against the

    accused altered from the offence under <a href="/doc/455468/" id="a_6">Section 307</a>

    I.P.C. to the one under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_7">Section 302</a> of I.P.C. After

    completion    of    investigation,    the    C.P.l.      submitted
    chargesheet against the accused for the offenoes under

    <a href="/doc/538436/" id="a_8">Sections 498A</a> and <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_9">302</a> I.P.C. and the accused came to

    be tried by the Trial Court for the same.




</p><p id="p_10">         4. On appreciation of the oral evidence of PWs1 to

    15, the documents at Exs.P1 to 15 and M.O. Nos.1 to

    3, the Trial Court, by its impugned Judgment and

    Order, convicted the appellant-accused for both the

    said offences.     Therefore, the accused has challenged

    the correctness of the same in this appeal.


</p><p id="p_11">         5.   We have      heard   the arguments of Sri             M.B.
    Gundawade,       the learned     counsel for the         appellant
    accused and Sri V.M. Banakar, the learned Addi. S.P.P.

    and perused the entire material found in the records

    obtained from the Trial Court.
</p>
<p id="p_13">


</p><p id="p_14">          6. Sri M.B. (3undawade, the learned counsel for

    the   appellant-accused     strongly   contends    that   the

    conviction of the appellant-accused is based only on

    Ex.P12 dying declaration      which came to be recorded

    not   by   the   Taluka   Executive    Magistrate('TEM'   for

    short), but by PWI4 P.S.!., and therefore, conviction of

    the appellant-accused cannot be sustained in law. He

    further contends that the said dying declaration does

    not bear the endorsement of PW12, the Doctor who has

    given evidence before the Court that thc deceased was

    in a fit state of health to give the said statement; the

    said dying declaration is not in the form of question

    and answer, but it is in the form of narration; PW12,

    the Medical Officer, has not made any endorsement on

    it to the effect that the deceased was in a fit state of

    health to give her statement and         PWI5.    the Police

    Constable, who wrote the said statement has not made

                              eC
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                        7</span>

I


    his endorsement thereon for having written it, and

    therefore,    for     these   reasons       also     Ex.P12       dying
    declaration ought not to have been accepted by the

    Trial Court for basing conviction of the accused.                    He
    also contends that if it is the say of PW12 Medical

    Officer    that     the   deceased     affixed     her   left     thumb
    impression on Ex.P12 statement, the say of PWs. 14

    and 15 respectively the P.S.!. and the Constable, who

    prepared the said statement, that, since the left thumb

    of the deceased was burnt, her right thumb impression

    was taken on the said statement.                 This discrepancy

    goes to the very root of the case of the prosecution and

    casts serious doubt on             the genuineness of Ex.P12

    statement, and therefore, the Trial Court should not

    have relied upon it to basc the conviction.                     He also
    contends that except the allegations in Ex.Pl2 dying

    declaration, absolutely no evidence is there on record

    to base the conviction of the accused for the offence

    under     <a href="/doc/538436/" id="a_10">Section    498-A</a>    of   I.P.C.   inasmuch        as,    PW6
    Smt.Sharadamma and PW7 Chandrashekar, who are
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                               8</span>

w
    respectively     the    mother        and           elder       brother      of   the

    deceased, have not spoken anything about the alleged

    ill-treatment by the accused.
</p>
<p id="p_15">


</p><p id="p_16">          7.     Learned    counsel           for       the    appellant-accused

    further contends that though Ex.P12 dying declaration

    discloses that when the deceased was caught with fire,

    PW3 Tirupati and PW4 Yamanoorappa both came there

    and extinguished         the       fire       and     then      thcy    took      the

    deceased to the hospital, the said PWs. 3 and 4 have

    not   deposed     as    to     those          facts       and    therefore        the

    contents of Ex.Pl2 dying declaration ought not to have

    been relied upon.            While contending so, he prays for

    acquittal of the appellant-accused, of both the said

    offence s.
</p>
<p id="p_17">


</p><p id="p_18">          8. Per contra, the learned Addi. S.P.P. strongly

    contends      that,    law    is    well        settled      that      the    dying

    declaration need not always be in the form of question

    and answer and it may be in the form of narration; if
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                          9</span>

     the Doctor, in whose presence dying declaration is

     recorded, gives evidence that the deceased was in a fit

     state of health to give her statement, absence of his

     endorsement in specific words on the declaration as to

     that fact, would not be fatal to the prosecution.                            He

     further contends that PW15, the writer constable, who

     reduced to writing the statement of the deceased in the

     presence of PWI4 P.S.I. and PW12 Medical officer, has

     specifically stated in his evidence that he recorded the

     said   statement as        stated       by     the    deceased          in   the
     presence of the said witnesses, and therefore,                               the
     dying declaration         cannot        be   doubted.             He    further
     contends    that   the      discrepancy          as     to        the   thumb
     impression found on Ex.P12 does not affect the validity

     of dying declaration, and therefore, the Trial Court has

     rightly ignored the said discrepancy as the minor one

10.30 p.m. the injured Smt.Jyothi was brought to his

hospital by P.c. 42 of Kukanoor P.S. having sustained

was read over and explained to the deceased and then

     examination of this PWI2 Medical Officer it. could be

     seen that nothing is brought on record to disbelieve

     this evidence in his examination-in-chief.




</p><p id="p_31">              14. Ex.P13 is the case sheet pertaining to the

     admission of the deceased in the Government Hospital,

     Kukanoor.        This document is also marked through this

     PW12      Medical      Officer.     On     careful    reading of the

     contents of Ex.P13 it could be seen that history is

     written     as    Uburnt      by   husband     around       9.00 p.m.,
     kerosene smell from body present".               This endorsement

     in Ex.P13 clearly goes to show that the deceased was

     admitted in the hospital with a history that she was

     burnt by her husband               i.e.,   the accused.           Learned
     counsel     for the appellant-accused,               referring to     the
     contents of Ex.P13 ease sheet insofar as they relate to

     the history of the patient, contends that as could be

     seen     from the said contents,            the said       history was

     given,     not    by    the    deceased,      but     by    the    Police
     Constable, who brought the deceased to the hospital,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                    15</span>




and therefore, since the prosecution has not examined

the said Police Constable, it could not be held that the

said history was given by the deceased herself.                   This
submission does not deserve acceptance for the reason

that, though it is mentioned in the case sheet that the

deceased was brought to the hospital by P.C. No. 42 of

Kukanoor P.S., it cannot be said that the history was

given by the said Constable.               Besides this, P.W.12

Doctor     has   stated     in   his    evidence   that    when    he
enquired with the deceased, she told him that her

husband poured kerosene on her person and lit fire.

This     piece    of      evidence      has     remained     totally
unchallenged inasmuch as no specific suggestions are

made to this PW12 Medical Officer in this regard.                  No
material    is   brought    on record      to   suspect    that   the
deceased could be prompted to give the said history or

that some one either having interest in the deceased or

having an axe to grind against the accused could get

the said history mentioned in the case sheet falsely.

</p><p id="p_33">          16.     On    careful   reading     of    Ex.Pl2       dying

     declaration it could be seen that, at the foot of the

     statement,   the   Doctor    has    endorsed   that   the    said
     statement came to be recorded in his presence.              Below

     the said endorsement he has put his signature and he

     Referring to this endorsement, learned counsel for the

     appellant-accused contends that this endorsement does

     not disclose that the deceased was in a fit state of

     health so as to give the said statement, and therefore,

     the   Trial   Court    ought     to    have    rejected   the    said

     statement.    It is well settled that such an endorsement

     by the Doctor has to be taken on the dying declaration

     as a matter of caution to see that the statement was

     voluntary and truthful.        The Doctor has made entry in

     the case sheet        Ex.Pl3 as to the history               that the

     husband of the deceased burnt her and kerosene smell

     was present on her body.               He has deposed in his

     evidence before the Court that the deceased disclosed

     before him that she was set on fire by her husband.

     Besides this, he has made endorsement on Ex.P12-

     dying declaration that the said statement was recorded

     in his presence.       Further, he has put his            signature

     just below the said endorsement and he has identified

     the    thumb        impression        of   the     deceased      and

    opinion that absence of specific endorsement in clear

    words on Ex.P12 that the deceased was in a fit state of

    her health to give the said statement is not fatal to the

    case of the prosecution and the dying declaration could

    not be rejected on that ground.

</p><p id="p_36">            17. Further, the absence of endorsement of PW15

    writer constable, who wrote the said dying declaration

    is    also   not    fatal   to   the        case   of   the    prosecution
    inasmuch as PW14 P.S.l. has stated in his evidence in

    clear terms that he got the said statement written by

    his writer P.C. in the presence of the Doctor and that

    after the same was written, its contents were read over

    and explained to the deceased and then he obtained

    her thumb impression. Added to this, PW15-the writer

    constable has also deposed the same.                    Besides this, as

    observed by us supra, recording of the said statement

impression found on Ex.P12 dying declaration.                           It is

the specific say of PW12 Medical Officer that the said

impression is of left thumb of the deceased.                        But it is

the specific say of PWs14 &amp; 15, respectively the P.S.l.

and writer constable, that the said impression is of

right    thumb of the        deceased.          It is       their    further

evidence that since her left thumb was injured, they

took right thumb impression on Ex.P12.                      It is endorsed

on Ex.P12 that it is right thumb impression.                           Ex.P7

Officer, who conducted autopsy on the dead body of the

deceased,     noticed      ink   mark     on    left    thumb        of the

which is found on Ex.P12 must be of left thumb of the

deceased, but not the right thumb of the deceased as

endorsed on it or as deposed by PWs. 14 and 15 in

    discloses that the deceased had sustained deep burn

    injuries all over her body except outer aspect of left

    leg, both soles, both palms and both axilla. The very

    fact    that   P.M.   Report,   which      is   not   in   dispute,

    discloses that inkmark was seen on the left thumb of

    the deceased goes to show that there was no burn

    injury to the left thumb of the deceased.              Thus, it is

    clear from these contents of P.M. report that, as rightly

    observed by the Trial Court in its Judgment, the left

    thumb of the deceascd was not injured so as to make it

    impossible for her to affix her left thumb impression on

    Ex.P12 dying declaration.             Therefore, we are of the

    considered     opinion   that   the     submission     of learned

    counsel for the appellant-accused that in view of the

    said discrepancy the Trial Court ought to have rejected

    Ex.P12 statement, cannot be accepted.

     if it is found to be voluntary and                      truthful.           It is
     pertinent to note that the deceased sustained burn

     injuries at about 9 p.m.                  She was admitted in the

     hospital by about 10.30 p.m. The information as to the

     admisslbn of the deceased in the hospital was given to

     PW14 P.5.1. by the Medical Officer concerned and the

     said P.5.1. received the same by about 10.45 p.m. and,

     in   response     thereto   he    immediately            rushed        to     the
     hospital for recording the statement of the deceased.

     It is also pertinent to note that the Ex.P12 statement

     came   to    be   rccorded       immediately            after   the     P.S.1.
     arrived at the hospital and, soon after the same was

     recorded, the deceased was shifted to KIMS Hospital,

     HubLi, for further treatment and that within 4 hours

     thereafter     she   succumbed             to     the    burn     injuries.
     Further,     immediately         after          recording       the     dying

     there, intimation was sent by the Medical Officer to the

    with   the   deceased,   the    names     of   parents   of the

     any of the    prosecution witnesses as to who could

     possibly give all such information to PWI4 P.S.l. for

         recording of dying declaration in narration form does

         not   make   it   either     inadmissible      in     evidence     or
         unworthy of acceptance, if circumstances under which

         it came to be recorded are not doubtful and it is found

         to be voluntary and truthful.          It is also settled that

         such dying declaration can be accepted even without

         corroboration as to the facts stated therein. In the

         instant   case,   as   already      observed    by        us   supra,
         circumstances under which Ex.P12 dying declaration

                                      c-cw
 came to be recorded were beyond any doubt.         Therefore

the said statement is rightly relied upon by the Trial

Court.

that when the deceased cried, PWs 3 and 4 rushed to

her house, extinguished fire and then she was taken to

the hospital.    PWs 3 and 4 have not stated these facts

in their evidence.       They have turned hostile to the

prosecution as to these facts.    However, they have fully

supported the case of prosecution that immediately

after the deceased was caught with fire, they heard her

cry, went there, saw the deceased on fire and then they

took the deceased to the hospital.

stated   in   their   cross-examination   that   immediately

after they came to the house, they asked the deceased

as to what had happened; she disclosed before them

that since she could not tolerate the stomach ache.

Referring to this portion of their evidence, learned

counsel for the appellant-accused strongly contends

that this is not the case of homicide, but it is a casc of

suicide and therefore the Trial Court should not have

convicted the accused.        Though it is the say of PWs 3

and 4 that the deceased disclosed before them that she

was suffering from severe stomach ache and therefore

she   set   herself    on   fire    to   commit    suicide,   PW6
Sharadamma, who is none other than the mother of the

deceased, has stated in her cross-examination that the

deceased was not suffering from any stomach ache.

Besides this, PW5 Shivappa, the father-in-law of the

deceased, has stated in his evidence that the deceased

was suffering from blood pressure and fits.             But PWÔ
mother has not stated so.           Added to this, the accused

has   not   given     any   explanation     in    his   statement
recorded under <a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_13">Section 313</a> of Cr.P.C. as to how the

deceased sustained the burn injuries.               He has not
stated anything about the deceased suffering from any

     disease,    muchless stomach ache or fits and blood

     pressure.    Therefore, it could not be held, on the basis

     of the abovc evidence of PWs 3 and 4, that it was a

     case of suicide, but not homicide.
</p>
<p id="p_53">


</p><p id="p_54">           26. Further contention of the learned counsel for•

     the appellant-accused is that except the allegations in

     Ex.P12     statement,    no other evidence is           placed on
     record by the prosecution to substantiate thc chargc

     for the offence under <a href="/doc/538436/" id="a_14">Section 498-A</a> of l.P.C., and

     therefore, conviction of the accused for the said offence

     cannot be sustained.      No doubt PWS, the mother of the

     deceased, PW7, the elder brother of thc deceased, have

     not stated in their evidence as to the alleged ill-

     treatment of the deceased by the accused in connection

     with his demand for money.             When once we accept

     Ex.Pl2 dying declaration as voluntary and truthful,

     nothing     more   would     be     required     than     to   see
     the contents thereof for arriving at the conclusion that

     the   deceased     was     subjected    to     cruel    treatment
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">                                  29</span>




by the accused in connection with his unlawful demand

for money as defined under Section 498 A of LP.C.' The

allegations    made    against    the    accused     in   the   said

statement clearls establish a case of cruel treatment by

the accused in connection with his unlawful demand

for money i.e., Z3 to 4 lakhs,                for purchasing the

tractor.    Further, the very motive for the accused to

pour kerosene on her person and set her on fire is non-

satisfaction of the said demand               for money by the

parents of the deceased.         Therefore, the submission of

learned counsel        for the appellant-accused that the

conviction of the accused for the offence under <a href="/doc/538436/" id="a_15">Section

498-A</a> of l.P.C. cannot be sustained, does not deserve

acceptance.

Court      committed    serious       error   in   convicting    the

accused for the offence under <a href="/doc/1868826/" id="a_16">Section 498</a> A of I.P.C.,

learned counsel for the appellant-accused has placed

strong reliance on the decision of Hon'ble Supreme

</p><p id="p_57">     720.      In the said case before the Hon'ble Supreme

     Court there was no evidence to show that the deceased

     was      in   a    fit   condition    to   make   her    declaration

     inasmuch as one of the Doctors, who was a member of

     Medical Board and who had examined the deceased,

     had stated that condition of the patient was so critical

     that it was even impossible to examine her injuries

     medically.        But the facts in the present case are totally

     different from those facts.          As we have observed supra,

     the deceased was in a fit state of health to give her

     statement as per Ex.P12 and therefore, the proposition

     laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the above

     said case is not helpful to the appellant-accused.

     found to be voluntary and truthful, the Trial Court

     rightly relied upon the same and convicted the accused
