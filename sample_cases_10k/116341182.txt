    According to these witnesses, the deceased Priyanka got married

    to the accused on 26/05/2003. The couple had two daughters.

    According to them, she was ill-treated by the accused Nos.2, 3

    and 4, who used to quarrel with her on flimsy grounds and also

    because, according to them, she could not deliver a male child.

    It is their case that, the Appellant was addicted to liquor and he

    used to doubt character of the deceased. The deceased Priyanka

    used to complain about these facts to her parents, who used to

    reside 25 kms away from her matrimonial house. It is deposed

    by P.W.1 that, on 14/09/2007, he received an anonymous call

    on his phone that Priyanka was dead and he should reach there

    Hospital at Khandala and she was already dead. According to

    narrated   about   the   illtreatment.   P.W.3   Manisha   Gaikwad

    14/09/2017.   He   had   explained   that   he   could   not   arrest   the

    admissible   in   evidence   and   not   properly   proved.   He   has

    submitted that, the Appellant was not the lone resident of the

    house. There is no record to show that the Appellant was in the

    house when the incident had taken place. Therefore it was not

    open   for   the   prosecution   to   allege   that   the   Appellant   had

    committed the said offence. He has further submitted that since

    the prosecution has not discharged, the burden of proving the

    basic facts, the burden of proof never shifted to the Appellant to

    prove his innocence. He has further submitted that the Appellant

    was not shown to be in the village and therefore there was no

    proof that the Appellant had any connection with the murder.

    He   has   further   submitted   that   the   Appellant   was   arrested   at

    06.40 p.m. on 14/09/2007 and that the Appellant in fact was

    not in the village. Otherwise the police would not have failed to

    arrest him immediately since his name was disclosed as per the

    prosecution case at around 07.00 a.m. itself.

    proved through the accused No.2, the accused No.2 obviously

    could   not   enter   the   witness   box   as   a   prosecution   witness   to

    prove contents of FIR. Therefore, the only the fact of registration

    of   FIR   at   the   instance   of   accused   No.2,   is   proved   by   the

    prosecution   through the  evidence  of P.W.4. The averments in

    the FIR in respect of confession made by the Appellant to the

    accused No.2 are inadmissible on that count and therefore, we

    are not taking into account the contents of FIR. However, the

    fact remains that the accused No.2 approached the police station

    at 07.00 a.m. in the morning and gave some complaint, which

    was   treated   as   FIR   and   the   offence   was   registered   vide

    already   acquitted   all   the   accused   including   present   Appellant

</p><p id="p_26"> 15.              The   crucial   question   remains   as   to   whether   the

    Appellant   can   be   convicted   for   the   offence   u/s   302   of   <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_11">IPC</a>.

    According to the learned counsel Mr.Rupwate, the prosecution

    has   not   brought   on   record   any   evidence   to   show   that   the

    Appellant was present in the house at that time. In this context,

    the reference can be made to the evidence of the prosecution

    witnesses and in particular the witness No.2 Pramod Bansode.

    He has clearly stated that all the accused cohabited together and

    the deceased was residing with them in her matrimonial house

    with them. There is no cross-examination to this deposition in

    respect of staying together in the house. There is no reason to

    infer otherwise and therefore there is no reason to hold that the

    Appellant was not at home at 04.00 a.m. on 14/09/07, when

    the incident had taken place. Considering the odd hours, early in

    the morning, there is no reason to presume that the Appellant

    may not be at home. In such circumstances, it was the duty of

    the Appellant to have proved that he was not at home, because

    the   burden   was   clearly   on   him   u/s   106   of   the   <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_12">Evidence   Act</a>,

    which reads thus;

    he has not discharged that burden.

    that there were other inmates in the house including the parents

    of the Appellant. Therefore it cannot be said that the burden was

    only   on   the   Appellant   to   explain   the   circumstances.   In   this

    connection, the learned prosecutor submitted that the while the

    husband and wife were residing in the house, the burden was

    clearly   on   the   Appellant   himself.   Even   assuming   the   other

    accused   did   not   explain   the   circumstances,   still   the   present

    Appellant cannot escape from his responsibility to discharge the

    burden u/s 106 of the <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_13">Evidence Act</a> and to explain the facts. In

    any   case,   the   accused   No.2   i.e.   father   of   the   Appellant   had

    approached the police station in the morning. The Appellant had

    not   even   done   that.   He   had   not   even   tried   to   provide   any

    medical help. Therefore we hold that the burden of providing

    u/s 106 of the <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_14">Evidence Act</a> was clearly on the Appellant which

    he has not discharged and therefore we are inclined to hold that

    the Appellant had committed murder of his wife.



</p><p id="p_34"> 18.              The learned Counsel Mr.Rupamate submitted that the

    Appellant was not immediately arrested though his name was

    disclosed at 07.00 a.m. in the morning. In this connection, the

    Investigating   Officer   has   explained   that,   he   was   busy   in   the

    other investigation and therefore he did not arrest him till 06.40

    p.m. Though this explanation is not entirely acceptable, that by

    itself will not show that, the accused was not in the village. The

    Appellant in his statement u/s 313 of <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_15">Cr.P.C</a>. has not explained

    as to where he was at that time, when the incident had taken

    place and he has not even taken a specific defence that he was

    at a particular spot or in a different city when the incident had

    taken place. Therefore, there is no force in the submissions of

    learned   counsel   Mr.Rupamate   that   the   Appellant  was   not   the

    village or in the house and therefore it was not for him to explain

    the circumstances in which the deceased met with her death.



</p><p id="p_35"> 19.              The prosecution through the evidence of P.W.1, P.W.2

    and P.W.3 has already sufficiently established the motive behind

    the   murder.   The   prosecution   witnesses   have   stated   that   the

    Appellant was doubting her character and that he was addicted

    to liquor and that had led to commission of murder. Here again,

    there is no serious challenge to such deposition and therefore we

    hold that even the motive is proved by the prosecution.



</p><p id="p_36"> 20.              Learned   counsel   Mr.Rupwate   has   relied   on   the

    judgment of Joes alias Pappachan Vs. Sub-Inspector of Police,

    Koyilandy &amp; Anr., reported in AIR 2016 SCC 5481. In the said

    case it was held that the alleged motive, that the accused therein

    had developed extramarital relationship and wanted to kill his

    wife,   was  not   proved  in  that  case.  There  was  no  evidence  to

    show that at relevant time, the accused was present in the house

    and  therefore  burden  of proving u/s 106 of the <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_16">Evidence  Act</a>




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">::: Uploaded on - 10/10/2017                       ::: Downloaded on - 11/10/2017 02:07:35 :::</span>

    was not directed against the accused therein. In that case, the

    incident had taken place between 06.30 p.m. to 08.30 p.m. This

    time is not such when the accused has to be at home. But in the

    present case, the incident had taken place at 04.00 a.m. in the

    early  morning   and therefore  it  was for the  Appellant  to have

    explained   the   circumstances,   which   were   within   his   exclusive

    knowledge. Mr.Rupwate thereafter relied on the judgment in the

    case of  Tomaso Bruno and Anr. Vs. State of UP, reported in

    2015   Cri.L.J.   1690.   In   the   said   case,   the   piece   of   valuable

    evidence  in  the form of CCTV footage  was not  produced and

    therefore  benefit was given to the Appellant. In the said case

    there   were   more   than   one   inmates   in   the   hotel   where   the

    murder   was   committed   and   the   accused   has   taken   a   specific

    defence that they had gone out at the time when the offence was

    committed. In the said case, the best possible evidence in the

    form of CCTV footage was not produced on record and therefore

    the accused were given benefit of doubt. Such is not the case

    before us in the present case and therefore this judgment is not

    helpful to Mr.Rupwate.

    case of  Nagaraj Vs. State represented by Inspector of Police,

    Salem Town, reported in (2015) 4 Supreme Court Cases 739,

    wherein   it   was   held   that   unsatisfactory   answers   in   the

    on the basis of unsatisfactory answers given in the examination

    u/s 313 of <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_18">Cr.P.C</a>. We have assessed the prosecution evidence to

    section.   In   this   context,   we   are   relying   on   the   judgment   of

    Hon'ble Supreme Court, in the case of Dalbir Singh Vs. State of

    UP, reported in (2002) 5 Supreme Court Cases 334. In this

    case,   it   was   held   that,   though   a   particular   charge   was   not

    framed during the trial, after the evidence led during the trial if

    it gives sufficient notice of the allegations against the accused,

    the conviction can be recorded in respect of such charge.
