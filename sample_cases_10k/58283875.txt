     THIS MFA IS FILED U/S 173(1) OF MV ACT AGAINST
THE JUDGMENT AND AWARD DATED 8.9.2008 PASSED IN
MVC NO. 5165/2007 ON THE FILE OF THE XIX ADDL.
JUDGE, COURT OF SMALL CAUSES, MEMBER, MACT,
METROPOLITAN AREA, BANGALORE, (SCCH.NO.17), PARTLY
ALLOWING THE CLAIM PETITION FOR COMPENSATION AND
SEEKING ENHANCEMENT OF COMPENSATION.

     This appeal coming on for Admission, this day, the
Court, delivered the following:

                      JUDGMENT
</pre>

<p id="p_1">     This    appeal   is   by       the   claimants   seeking

enhancement of compensation awarded by the Tribunal.


</p><p id="p_2">2.   Heard. The appeal is admitted and with the consent

of learned Counsel appearing for the parties, it is taken up

for final disposal.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                             3</span><p id="p_3">




</p><p id="p_4">3.    For the sake of convenience parties are referred to as

they are referred to in the claim petition before the

Tribunal.
</p>
<p id="p_5">
</p><p id="p_6">4.    As there is no dispute regarding death of deceased

Muniyappa in a motor traffic accident occurred on

18.05.2007 due to rash and negligent driving of Tractor

Trailer     bearing   registration   Nos.    KA-05-T-4613,

KA-05-T-4614 by its driver and liability of the insurer of

the said vehicle only point remains for consideration is :

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">            Whether quantum of compensation
      awarded by the Tribunal is just and proper
      or does it call for enhancement?
</blockquote>
<p id="p_7">5.    The claim petition is filed by the parents of the

deceased seeking compensation under <a href="/doc/100153505/" id="a_1">Section 163</a> (A) of

the Motor Vehicles Act. The claimants in support of their

contention that their deceased son by working as a loader

and unloader/labour in the offending tractor-trailer was

earning Rs.40,000/- per annum have examined the first

claimant father of the deceased as PW 1. Though the said
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                4</span>




contention is not supported by producing any documents,

considering the age of the deceased as 30 years, year of

accident as 2007 and his avocation as coolie his income

could easily be assessed at Rs.40,000/- per annum.

Since, it is a case under <a href="/doc/100153505/" id="a_2">Section 163(A)</a> of M.V. Act 1/3rd

of his income has to be deducted towards his personal

expenses and 2/3rd is to be taken towards his contribution

to family.     The multiplier of 13 is to be applied based on

the age of the mother of the deceased and not 11 applied

by   the     Tribunal    as per    Schedule II   of   M.V.    Act.

Accordingly,      loss    of   dependency    works      out     to

Rs.3,46,667/- (Rs.40,000/- x 2/3 x 13) and it is awarded

as against Rs.2,64,000/- awarded by the Tribunal.


</p><p id="p_8">5.    In addition to that a sum of Rs.4,500/- is awarded

under conventional heads.
</p>
<p id="p_9">
</p><p id="p_10">6.    The claimants are entitled for a total compensation

of Rs.3,51,167/- as against Rs.2,94,000/- awarded by the

Tribunal.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                              5</span><p id="p_11">




</p><pre id="pre_2"> Total compensation                     Rs. 3,51,167/-


Less compensation awarded by the
Tribunal                                Rs. 2,94,000/-
                                        Rs.   57,167/-

</pre><p id="p_12">7.   Accordingly the appeal is allowed in part and the

Judgment and award of the Tribunal is modified to the

extent stated herein above. The claimants are entitled for

additional compensation of Rs.57,167/- with interest at

6% p.a.   from the date of claim petition till the date of

realization excluding interest for the delayed period of 203

days in filing the appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_13">
</p><p id="p_14">8.   The Insurance Company is directed to deposit the

additional compensation amount with interest, within two

months from the date of receipt of a copy of this judgment,

excluding interest for 203 days,    from which 75% with

proportionate interest is ordered to be deposited in FD in

the name of the claimant No.2, mother of the deceased, in

any nationalized/scheduled Bank or post office for a

period of three years, with a right of option to withdraw
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                6</span>




interest periodically and the remaining amount is ordered

to be released in favour of claimants 1 and 2 in equal

proportion.    The Tribunal while releasing 25% of the

compensation is also directed to issue F.D.slip to the

claimant No.2 to enable her to withdraw the amount on its

maturity without approaching the Tribunal once again.
