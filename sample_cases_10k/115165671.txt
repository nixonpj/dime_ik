  to registration of FIR however the same was not investigated by

  the police and he has further argued that the PW2 Anita Sharma

  had stated that she was asked to lay on stretcher but there is no

  stretcher in the clinic of the accused. He has annexed the

  photographs of the clinic to show the same.   Factual truth of the

  story made by the complainant is false as when the accused

  called her inside she was asked about her previous prescription

  slip to which she showed her inability to produce and when the

  accused refused to go ahead with the further treatment, she

  along with other 2/3 persons gave beatings to him severely. He

<p id="p_26">23.    Before adverting to the contention of the ld. Defence

  counsel, the case of the prosecution in brief is that this lady

  Anita Sharma went to the clinic of the accused who is dentist on

  31.03.2013 to the clinic of accused in the day time at about

  10:15 am/10:30 am and accused told her that he wants to see

  her stomach so that the layer on teeth could not grow again.

  She laid down on the stretcher and he asked her whether her

  clothes were tight or loose and she replied that she is wearing a

  sari as usual. He asked her to loose her clothes and she should

  not keep physical relations with her husband and have relations

  with him and wear loose clothes and thereafter she became

  angry and slapped the accused three or four times and on her

  noise her nephew Gauri Shankar also came inside and she

  narrated the whole story and he also became angry and called

  the police. PW3 in his statement has also stated that at 10:40

  am he along with his Mami i.e. PW2 went to the clinic of the

  accused for check up and after some time he heard a noise and

  he entered into the cabin and saw that PW2 was slapping the

  accused and when he asked about incident, she told him that

  accused teased her and touched her private parts and she

  started slapping him and in the course of slapping, he received

  injuries due to breaking of bangles. He also slapped on the right

  cheek of the accused and when accused caught hold of his

  hand, he called at 100 number. Both the witnesses were cross-

  examined by ld. Defence counsel. Ld. Counsel for accused has

  vehemently argued that there was no stretcher in the cabin of

  the accused and for proving the same, he has annexed certain

  photographs. In respect of these photographs, it is stated that

  photographs have been taken by the accused as per his own

  convenience and by different angles. All the corners of the cabin

  have not been photographed. It is further stated that accused

  was at liberty to take the photographs according to his own

  choice and he could shift any of the articles to any place and

  photographs simplicitor cannot be relied upon to prove that

  there was no stretcher. Though the complainant has admitted

  the geographical location as per the photographs however in my

  opinion they are not very clear. In this regard it is important to

  discuss the testimony of the defence evidence. DW1 Ram Niwas

  who the attendant of the accused on the relevant date. Being

  the defence witness, the accused has produced him and

  therefore there is no doubt while taking his testimony into

  consideration. Moreover, ld. Counsel has already relied upon

  judgment State of Haryana Vs. Ram Singh (supra) wherein

  it has been stated that equal treatment has to be given to the

  defence witness.

<p id="p_27">24.    DW1 Ram Niwas has factually stated in his testimony that

  patient, one table and chair for accused and a bench for the

  patient. In my considered opinion the bench for the patient

  which find mention in the testimony of DW1 Ram Niwas has

  been termed as Stretcher by the complainant herein in her

  testimony. Ld. Counsel stated that there was anything else. He

  has put a question to witness PW2 in her cross-examination

  there was no stretcher in the clinic of the accused and there was

  only a chair for patient. Further the story of the defence with

  respect to the fact that there was no stretcher in the cabin of the

  accused has become false by own evidence of DW1 produced by

  the defence    who has stated that there was a bench for the

  patient. PW2 has deposed in a very natural manner by stating

  that first the accused checked her at his dental chair and

  thereafter stated that he wants to see her stomach so that the

  layer on teeth does not grow again, since there was a bench as

  per the testimony of DW1 in the cabin, she laid down there and

  thereafter, the entire incident occurred.
</p>
<p id="p_28">25.    The   whole    sequence    which   is   developed      from     the

  combined testimony of PW1 and DW1 belies the contention of

  counsel for accused with regard to absence of any stretcher in

  cabin of accused.
</p>
<p id="p_29">26.    Ld. Counsel for accused has argued that PW3 Gauri

  Shankar is a tutored witness as he was confronted with his

  statement u/s 161 Cr. PC. Ex. PW3/DA wherein the factum of

  slapping the accused were not recorded.           Ld. Counsel for

  accused submitted that PW3 is a tutored witness therefore, his

  testimony cannot be relied upon. In this regard it is stated that

  PW2 and PW3 are the natural witness and have deposee in a

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">                                                                         21 </span>
                                                 State Vs.  Joginder Babbar 

  natural manner. One cannot expect a natural witness to depose

  in the manner in which their statements u/s 161 Cr. PC. are

  recorded by police officials. It is further pertinent to note here

  that incident is of year 2003 whereas the witness PW3 had been

  examined in the year 2009 and his cross-examination had been

  conducted in June 2012 i.e. after a long gap between the date of

  statement and recording his testimony. Same is testimony of

  PW2 whose testimony was recorded for the first time in August

  2006 and thereafter, February 2007 and thereafter, in 2009.

  Herein in the present case, though there are certain minor

  discrepancy in the testimony of both the witness in saying that it

  was not mentioned in the statement before the police that the

  bangles of PW3 were broken and she was bleeding and he has

  received injuries or he gave slaps on the right cheeks of the

  accused.      One should understand the mental faculty of the

  witness or the person who was present at the time of

  commission of the crime.       On the point of contradiction or

  improvement it has to be seen whether the case of the

  prosecution has been supported in totality by the witness or not

  in the present case except for certain discrepancy the entire

  case of the prosecution has been supported by both the witness.

</p><p id="p_30">27.     Both the witnesses cannot be expected to depose more

  effectively   than   they   have   deposed.   By   no    stretch      of

  imagination, it can be stated that both the witnesses are tutored.

  Minor discrepancy are bound to occur in the statement of

  natural witnesses . We have to analysis whether the witness has

  changed his statement entirely which leads to the         conclusion

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">                                                                        22 </span>

  that the incident as alleged            did not take place. But here, the

  testimony of witnesses clearly indicates that occused has

  misbehaved with PW2 with the intention to outrage her modesty.

  The testimony of PW2 and PW3 is trustworthy in view of the fact

  that they have successfully passed the test of cross-examination

  and their veracity could not be shaked.

                appellants counsel had been trivial in nature
                which do not go to the root of the cause.
</p><p id="p_33">                It   is   settled   legal    proposition       that     while
                appreciating the evidence, the court has to take
                into         consideration            whether            the
                contradiction/omissions/improvements/embellis

                entire evidence must form an opinion about the

<p id="p_34">29.    Further mere          taking a plea in defence that the witness

  were asked the previous prescription by the accused and she

  showed her inability and when accused refused to go ahead,


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">                                                                                     23 </span>

  they started beating him appears to be unrealistic as a patient

  would not start manhandling a doctor just for being asked for

  prescription slip. The defence put forth by the prosecution

  appears to be very unrealistic. Hence, the judgment relied upon

  by the defence counsel are not applicable and witnesses are not

  at all tutored witnesses.
</p>
<p id="p_35">30.     Since the witnesses are not tutored witnesses it can be

  said that judgments relied upon by ld. Defence counsel are not

  applicable to the present case. As far as contention of not

  mentioning of time of arrest has been raised by the defence

  counsel, it is stated that though this can be termed irregularlity

  in view of D.K. Basu Vs.      Vs. State of West Bengal, AIR

  1997, SC 610 but we are all aware that the investigation has to

  be conducted by the IO and any defective investigation cannot

  allow the accused to derive any benefit therefrom.         He is not

  entitled to acquittal for the reason that time of arrest was not

  mentioned in the arrest memo. It is also pertinent to mention

  here that ld. Counsel for accused has relied upon Ex. PW1/DA

  which is a complaint moved by the accused to the police with

  regard to the beatings given to him by the complainant and her

  associates. He has himself relied upon Ex. PW5/DA wherein DD

  No. 12-A, dated 31.03.2013. It has been recorded on 11:21 am

  wherein, it has been stated that the accused had misbehaved

  with lady and at this quarrel has occurred. Ld. Defence counsel

  has failed to show at what time the complaint Ex. PW1/DA was

  given by accused. The defence has also produced DW2, record

  clerk from the LBS Hospital who has proved the MLC of the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">                                                                        24 </span>

     accused wherein, the injuries are shown that there was a

     swelling and redness over left external ear. Swelling over left

     pavital region of scalp, tenderness over left T.M.J and Bruise over

     left shoulder.   The MLC prove on record by the accused further

     support the case of prosecution as PW2 has factually stated that

     when the accused was outraging her modesty, she got angry

     and got from the stretcher and gave three/four slaps to accused.

     PW3 Gauri Shankar also on hearing whole incident got angry and

     he slapped on the right cheek of the accused.           The medical

     evidence produced by the accused himself supports the ocular

     evidence given by the witnesses PW2 and PW3. The MLC proved

     on record clearly proves the previous sequence which has been

     proved in the testimony of PW2 in which she had alleged that

     the accused has outraged her modesty. Hence, I am of the

     considered opinion that the testimony of PW2 and PW3 is

     absolutely trustworthy.   By the testimony of PW2 it has been

     established that the offence u/s 354 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_6">IPC</a> was committed by the

     accused as acts alleged to have been done by him clearly comes

     within the purview of <a href="/doc/203036/" id="a_7">section 354</a> IPC.     Therefore, prosecution

     has successfully proved the case. Hence, the accused is

     convicted for the charge framed for the offence u/s 354 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_8">IPC</a>. Let

     he be heard on the point of sentence on 05.10.2012 at

     02:00 pm.
