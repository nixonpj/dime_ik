       This MFA coming on for Hearing, this day, the Court
delivered the following:

                         JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">        This appeal by the owner is directed against the

judgment and award dated 9th July 2009, passed in

MVC          No.1278/2005,    by    the   Additional        Civil

Judge(Sr.Dn) &amp; CJM, Motor Accident Claims Tribunal,

Mandya, (for short, 'Tribunal'), awarding compensation

of a sum of `5,04,285/- with interest @ 8% p.a. in

favour of the claimant, for the injuries sustained by the

claimant in the road traffic accident.


</p><p id="p_2">        2.      The respondent herein, B.C. Suhas, aged

about 3 ½ years is the injured claimant in the instant

case.    He, being minor, is represented by his natural

guardian, father, who filed the claim petition under

<a href="/doc/136948773/" id="a_2">Section 166</a> of the Motor Vehicles Act, claiming

compensation       against   the   appellant/owner     of    the

offending vehicle, on account of the injuries sustained

by the claimant in the accident that occurred at about
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                             3</span>




4:00 P.M, on 06-06-2004, in front of Raghuveer Stores,

Mandya Bazaar Street of Mandya City, due to the rash

and negligent driving by the driver of Hero Honda

bearing Registration No.CTM-6327. Due to the impact,

the claimant sustained grievous injuries, such as

abrasion of about 2 cm x 1 cm over medial aspect of

right knee, abrasion about 4 cm x 4 cm over medial

aspect of right leg, abrasion about 1 cm x 1 cm over

medial aspect of right ankle, contusion of upper lips,

tenderness over right clavicle. Immediately, he was

shifted to General Hospital, Mandya, thereafter to

NIMHANS Hospital, Bangalore and thereafter to JSS

Hospital, Mysore for treatment of the said injuries.

</p><p id="p_3">     3.   On account of the injuries sustained in the

accident, the claimant, represented by his father,

natural guardian filed the claim petition under <a href="/doc/136948773/" id="a_3">Section

166</a> of the Motor Vehicles Act, before the Tribunal,

seeking compensation of a sum of `10.80 lakhs against

the appellant/owner of the offending vehicle. The said

claim petition had come up for consideration before the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                             4</span>




Tribunal on 9th July, 2009.        The Tribunal, after

considering the relevant material available on file and

after appreciation of the oral and documentary evidence,

allowed the claim petition in part, awarding a sum of

`5,04,285/- under different heads, with interest at 8%

per annum from the date of petition till the date of

realization and directed the appellant owner of the

offending vehicle to indemnify the award.          Being

aggrieved by the said direction issued to indemnify the

award passed by Tribunal, the appellant/owner is in

appeal before this Court, seeking to set aside the same.

</p><p id="p_4">     4. I have gone through the grounds urged in the

memorandum of appeal and the impugned judgment

and award passed by Tribunal and heard the learned

counsel appearing for the appellant/owner and the

learned counsel appearing for claimant.

</p><p id="p_5">     5. When this matter had come up for admission

on 28th January 2010, notice was ordered and stay of

the award was granted, subject to deposit of 30% of the

total award amount, within four weeks and the matter
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                5</span>




was directed to be posted after service of notice. The

appellant   has     complied   with   the    said   order   by

depositing a sum of `1,51,285/- in the Registry on 23rd

August 2010 vide No.528541 and as per the order

passed by this Court dated 7th July 2010, the same is

re-deposited   in    ING   Vyshya,    in    the   High   Court

Extension Counter, Bangalore. On 15th February 2012,

this matter was referred to Lok Adalath and when the

matter came up before Lok Adalath on 28th March 2012,

the matter was referred back to Court. Further, on 23rd

May 2012, the matter was again referred to Lok Adalath

and on 28th June 2012, the matter was adjourned to

next sitting. After a couple of sittings before the Lok

Adalath, the matter was again referred back to Court on

3rd September 2012.        Finally when this matter had

come up for consideration on 20th March 2013, after

due deliberation in the matter, amicable settlement was

arrived at in which, the appellant/owner submitted that

he is ready and willing to pay a sum of `4,00,000/- as

global compensation in full and final settlement of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                             6</span>




claim without interest, as against the award passed by

Tribunal.     Out of the said amount, the appellant has

already deposited a sum of `1,51,285/- and the same is

re-deposited in Fixed Deposit in the ING Vyshya Bank,

Extension Counter. The balance amount to be paid by

the appellant is `2,48,715/- and at the request of the

learned counsel appearing for appellant, the matter is

posted today.
</p>
<p id="p_6">      6.    I have heard learned counsel appearing for

both parties. The appellant/owner and the father and

natural guardian of the minor child are present before

the Court and their presence is placed on record.

</p><p id="p_7">      7.     During the course of submission, learned

counsel appearing for appellant, Shri. Venkataswamy V

for Shri. Mari Gowda, has handed over a Demand Draft

dated 3rd April 2013, bearing No.121430, for a sum of

`2.00 lakhs drawn in favour of Channegowda, father

and natural guardian of the minor child/claimant and

the   same    has been duly acknowledged       by Shri.

Channegowda, who is present before the Court.       The
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                7</span>




same is placed on record. Further, the appellant, who

is present before the Court submitted that he may be

exempted from payment of the remaining sum of

`48,715/-.
</p>
<p id="p_8">      8. As against this, learned counsel appearing for

claimant submitted that it was a tough job to convince

his client, the natural guardian of the minor child to

settle the matter for global compensation of `4,00,000/-

as against `5,04,285/- with interest at 8% per annum

awarded by Tribunal.       Shri. Channegowda, who is

present before the Court is not agreeable for such

waiver.      However, after some time, learned counsel

appearing for appellant, on instructions from the

appellant submitted that the appellant/owner may be

permitted to pay the said sum of `48,715/- in two

instalments, within a period of two months from today.

The   said   submission   of       the   learned   counsel   for

appellant is placed on record. The appellant is directed

to pay a sum of `48,715/-, as expeditiously as possible,

at any rate, within a period of two months from today,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                            8</span>




either in two instalments or at one stretch, subject to

his convenience, by way of Demand Draft to Shri.

Channegowda, the father and natural guardian of the

minor child/claimant and file an affidavit for having

made such payment, within two months, in the

Registry.
</p>
<p id="p_9">      9. Having regard to the facts and circumstances

of the case, as stated above, the appeal filed by the

appellant/owner is disposed of and the impugned

judgment and award dated 9th July 2009, passed in

MVC     No.1278/2005,     by    the    Additional   Civil

Judge(Sr.Dn) &amp; CJM, Motor Accident Claims Tribunal,

Mandya, is hereby modified, as discussed above.
