                 CORAM: HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE ANIL KUMAR UPADHYAY
                                       ORAL ORDER</pre>

<p id="p_1">3   23-08-2018                  Heard learned counsel for the petitioner and counsel

                  appearing on behalf of the State.
</p>
<p id="p_2">                                This writ petition was filed on 10.2.2014 after service

                  of two advance copies to the office of the Advocate General.

                  Even after lapse of 4 Â½ years no counter affidavit was filed on

                  behalf of the respondent.
</p>
<p id="p_3">                                From perusal of the order contained in Annexure-4, it

                  appears that the service of the petitioner was cancelled by the

                  Panchayat Secretary on the pretext that there is variance in the

                  age as per certificate. From perusal of Annexure-3, it appears

                  that the Panchayat Secretary has made communication to the
 Patna High Court CWJC No.3288 of 2014(3) dt.23-08-2018
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                            2/3</span>




         B.D.O. Manigashi, that the appointment of this petitioner was in

         accordance with rules and he has submitted Photostat copy of

         original certificate for consideration of the B.D.O. Manigashi

         and the documents contained in Annexure-1 Series indicates that

         the petitioner's date of birth is 22.01.1987. He was appointed as

         teacher in 2007 and as such the Court does not find any

         infirmity on the point of age to find fault in the appointment of

         the petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_4">                      Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that

         petitioner was condemned unheard as opportunity of hearing

         was not provided to him before the order contained in

         Annexure-4 passed.
</p>
<p id="p_5">                      Since the respondents have not filed any counter

         affidavit and the available material indicates that there is no

         infirmity in the appointment of the petitioner, the Court

         constrained to hold that the order contained in Annexure-4 is

         unsustainable, it is accordingly quashed, for the reason that no

         order vititing evil and civil consequences can be passed without

         compliance of principles of natural justice as held out by the

         Apex Court in catena of judgment including the case of H.L.

         Trehan reported in AIR 1989 (S.C) 568. The writ petition is

         accordingly       allowed,       with     all   consequential   benefits.
           Patna High Court CWJC No.3288 of 2014(3) dt.23-08-2018
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                                      3/3</span>




                   Respondents are directed to extend all consequential benefits to

                   the petitioner within a period of four months from the date of

                   receipt/ production of a copy of this order.
