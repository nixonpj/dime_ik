<p id="p_1">9   10-07-2014                  A rank dishonest writ application has been filed by

                 the petitioner for an obvious illegal benefit which he knows very

                 well was not available to him. The Court has occasion to record

                 its opinion in such strong terms taking into consideration that the

                 petitioner has filed the present writ application, which was

                 registered on 5.8.2013 for a relief which was never available to

                 any person similarly placed and in fact, the decision of the

                 government to recover benefit of increment drawn by some other
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1"> Patna High Court CWJC No.15127 of 2013 (9) dt.10-07-2014</span>

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                          2/4</span>




             persons has been upheld by the High Court in a writ application

             heard and decided on 28.2.2013. The said decision is reported in

             2013 (3) PLJR 408, which is case of Surya Kumar Das versus

             the State of Bihar.
</p>
<p id="p_2">                             The sole petitioner before this Court besides other

             things also harps on his right to beget increment every year on the

             minimum time scale even though he was a daily wager under the

             respondents.       He tried to draw analogy and support from a

             decision rendered in CWJC No.10660 of 1996 as well as LPA

             No.274 of 1996. All would have been well for the petitioner, if

             there was no adjudication on such right to claim increment

             despite those previous orders of the High Court was not put to

             test in a fresh decision which was taken by the respondent

             authorities when they decided to recover the amount of increment

             drawn by such persons in the year 2011, which came to be

             contested by same person Surya Kumar Das, who had way back

             in the year 1996 moved the High Court and got some kind of

             direction or observation from the High Court.

</p><p id="p_3">                             The Court would not like to waste its time on the

             judicial side by going into all the parameters of the dispute and

             trace the history again because it is readily available in the

             reported decision and a reading of the same puts the factual and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3"> Patna High Court CWJC No.15127 of 2013 (9) dt.10-07-2014</span>

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                          3/4</span>




             the legal matrix across the board.
</p>
<p id="p_4">                             After due deliberation, learned single Judge did hold

             that such increments were never available to such people,

             therefore, much less the present petitioner, where there is a fine

             distinction because Surya Kumar Das, if at all was a beneficiary

             of the decision rendered by the learned single Judge and the LPA

             Bench, which was LPA 274 of 1996. Petitioner is only trying to

             draw analogy from the said decision and was not part and parcel

             of such adjudication. After the learned Judge did hold that there

             was no occasion to draw increment and the recovery was not

             interfered with, there will be no occasion for this Court to give a

             direction for grant of increment to the petitioner, which will be in

             teeth of the judicial adjudication made in the case of Surya

             Kumar Das (supra). On that score the present writ application is

             required to be dismissed especially when other retiral dues have

             already been settled as stated in the counter affidavit of the State.

</p><p id="p_5">                             Such prayer of the petitioner should have been

             decided by imposition of cost but taking into consideration that

             he was a low paid employee, the Court is indulgent.        Petitioner

             is expected to have knowledge of such judicial adjudication

             because if he has knowledge of the advantage which Surya

             Kumar Das had drawn, he should have had knowledge of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">      Patna High Court CWJC No.15127 of 2013 (9) dt.10-07-2014</span>

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                               4/4</span>




                  subsequent decision, which has taken away that benefit.

</p><p id="p_6">                                  Writ is dismissed with regard to the said prayer.
