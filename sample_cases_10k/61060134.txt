                        1                 M.Cr.C. No.2362/2017

       Vidhyasagar Dhody Vs. G.C.M. Construction Pvt. Ltd.
Gwalior Bench Dated : 10/01/2019
       Shri Sanjay Dwivedi and Shri Sanjay Gupta, learned counsel
for the petitioner.
       Shri Mukesh Sharma, learned counsel for the respondent.</pre>
<p id="p_1">       With consent heard finally.
</p><p id="p_2">       The present petition is preferred by the petitioner under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_1">Section
482</a> of the Code of the Criminal Procedure, 1973 taking exception to
the order dated 07-12-2016 passed by the Additional Chief Judicial
Magistrate in Criminal Case No.535/2005 whereby cognizance has
been taken and application for discharge has been rejected.
Petitioner is also taking exception to the order dated 03-02-2017
passed by the Sessions Judge, Gwalior whereby the revision has
been rejected as withdrawn.
</p><p id="p_3">       Precisely stated facts of the case for adjudication are that a
case under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_2">Section 138</a> of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881
(hereinafter referred to as 'the Act') was filed by the respondent
against the present petitioner for dishonour of cheque in the year
2002. Because of the problem in petitioner family wherein his wife
succumbed to the cancer disease, his son underwent renal operation,
lost three brothers and two brothers-in-law, therefore, compelled by
the said circumstances, petitioner could not appear and make
payment of amount to the respondent. Later on, he appeared in the
Court and explained the reason for being late but he paid the amount
before appearance before Court and therefore, according to him, no
legally recoverable debt is to be paid by the petitioner.
</p><p id="p_4">       On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondent
opposed the submission made by the petitioner and tried to contend
that trial Court rightly rejected the application for discharge. It is
further submitted by the respondent that the case involves criminal
liability and it is to be ascertained whether the amount paid by the
petitioner is in respect of the same liability which respondent has
raised through his private complaint. Thus, prayed for dismissal of
petition.
</p><p id="p_5">                          THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                    2                 M.Cr.C. No.2362/2017</span>

                   Rival submissions are heard and mandate of the Hon'ble
           Apex Court in the matter of Meters and             Instruments Private
           Limited and another Vs. Kanchan Mehta, (2018) 1 SCC 560 is
           perused which is relevant in the case.
</p><p id="p_6">                   The Hon'ble Apex Court in the case in hand given certain
           guidelines in which while considering the dictum of earlier judgment
           of Indian Bank Association Vs. Union of India, (2014) 5 SCC 590
           mandates that the offence under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_3">Section 138</a> of the Act is primarily
           civil wrong and the object of the provision being primarily
           compensatory, punitive element being mainly with the object of
           enforcing     the compensatory element, compounding          at the initial
           stage has to be encouraged. Therefore, trial Court has to consider
           this aspect and therefore, the application which has been filed by
           the petitioner for closure of the case, in view of the payment made by
           the petitioner is to be seen in correct perspective.
</p><p id="p_7">                   Resultantly, the order dated 07-12-2016 and the order even
           date framing charge are hereby set aside. Similarly, the revisional
           order passed by the Sessions Judge, Gwalior dated 03-02-2017 also
           pales into oblivion. Parties shall appear before the trial Court on 12-
           02-2019 and press for hearing and shall advance arguments in which
           trial Court shall consider the mandate of the Hon'ble Apex Court
           referred above as well as facts of the case and thereafter ensure
           appropriate order over the said application.
</p><p id="p_8">                   Needless to say that decision shall be taken by the trial Court in
           accordance with law as expeditiously as possible.
</p><p id="p_9">                   Petition stands disposed of.
</p>

<p id="p_10">                                                                  (Anand Pathak)
                                                                      Judge
