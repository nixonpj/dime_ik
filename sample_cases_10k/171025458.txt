Due to intervening holiday the filed was handed over

the concerned AR on or around 25.04.2008. The Lok

Adalat was fixed for 27.04.2008, therefore, AR got busy

and could not get the file marked for filing of the

appeal. On 27.04.2008 i.e. Sunday father of Sh. M.K. Jha

the concerned AR expired. He had to leave to his

native place in hurry.   He came back on or around

20.05.2008. Thereafter the file was handed over to the

application and filed reply. It has been submitted that in

the application appellant/plaintiff has        prayed for

condonation of delay of 42 days whereas there is delay

of 55 days.      Reasons for condonation are vague,

insufficient   and   are   not    proper   explanation    for

condoning inordinate delay.        The words used on or

around in the application are sufficient to make out that

the application has been filed as a mere formality and

the basic requirement of explaining day to day delay

has not been considered at all.       The submissions are

vague and ambiguous. When the AR is on long leave

the appellant/applicant always sent some other AR to

take care of the matter.

</p><p id="p_27">10.      I rely on judgment dated 06/12/2007 passed by

Hon'ble Mr. Justice Pradeep Nandrajog, Judge, Delhi

High Court in RSA no.135/07 titled Delhi Development

Authority V/s Rajindra Properties &amp; Industries. Vide para

10 of this judgment, the principles of law guiding the

court in considering such applications have been

stated, which reads as follows :-
</p>
<p id="p_28">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">          ''10.     The principles of law which
          guide the court in considering
          applications which seek to show
          sufficiency of cause for a default
          may succinctly be stated as under :-
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">          (A)       Since processual laws are
          subservient to the substantive laws,
          unless the compelling language of a
          processual law leaves no scope for
          a contrary       interpretation,  a
          processual law must be construed in
          a manner which subserves the
          purpose of the substantive law.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">          (B)      No party is presumed to
          not enforce the statutory rights
          available to the party. Meaning
          thereby, the consideration must
          begin with a presumption in favour
          of the bona fides of the concerned
          party.
</blockquote>
<pre id="pre_2">          (C)        Whenever there is delay
          there    is bound to be some

                                             Contd.........
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                  -6-</span>

</pre><blockquote id="blockquote_4">negligence. Sans negligence there
would never be a delay resulting in
a default. Thus, the issue has not to
be looked with reference to
negligence alone but with reference
to the backdrop facts resulting in
delay or default as the case may
be.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">(D)        Each day's delay has not
to be considered, meaning thereby
pedantic approach has not to be
adopted by the Courts. The
pleadings     in   the   concerned
application have to be read
liberally and pragmatically.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">(E)       The pragmatic approach
requires the court to see whether
facts laid before the court evidence
a desire of the party to exercise its
statutory rights or not. Meaning
thereby, court has to look such
facts, wherefrom, it can be gathered
that the party was desirous of
exercising its statutory right and was
taking steps in said direction.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_7">(F)        As against a living human
being, where the party is a juristic
entity, the court has to be conscious
to the fact that the juristic entity acts
through a hierarchy of living human
beings and the file has to travel
various      tiers   as      per      the
administrative hierarchy in the
department.
</blockquote>
<pre id="pre_3">(G)       Even    if   the   delay     is


                                      Contd.........
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                           -7-</span>

</pre><blockquote id="blockquote_8">          excessive that by itself would not be
          sufficient to throw out a claim which
          otherwise is meritorious and if the
          litigant is an instrumentality of the
          state and the cause which is being
          espoused by it is as the custodian of
          public property, due weightage has
          to be given to said fact.''



</blockquote><p id="p_29">11.      It is pertinent to mention that in the appeal

application has to be considered under Order XLI Rule

3A CPC for condonation of delay, but for such

condonation also, the court has to satisfy regarding the

sufficient cause for not preferring the appeal within the

prescribed period. So, with regard to sufficient cause

even the sufficient cause explained in <a href="/doc/100581/" id="a_2">Section 5</a> of the

Limitation Act, 1963 can be considered.



</p><p id="p_30">12.      It is well settled proposition of law that if the

refusal to condone the delay result in grave miscarriage

of delay it would be a ground to condone the delay.

Moreover, <a href="/doc/100581/" id="a_3">Section 5</a> of Limitation Act was enacted in

order to enable the court to do substantial justice to

the parties by disposing off the matter on merits.

Similarly, the provision u/o XLI Rule 3A CPC, has to be

                                             Contd.........
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                              -8-</span><p id="p_31">

read    with    expression   ''sufficientcause''which          is

adequately elastic to enable the court to apply the law

in a meaningful manner which sub-serves the ends of

justice that being the life purpose of the existence of the

institution of courts.
</p>
<p id="p_32">

</p><p id="p_33">13.       As per well settled proposition of law, the court

has to adopt liberal approach in order to do substantial

justice in disposing the matter on merits.



</p><p id="p_34">14.       The delay in filing the appeal has been duly

explained in para-2 of the application under disposal

merely because there is wrong calculation of number of

days for which condonation has been sought is not fatal

because it is not the length of delay which has to be

considered but the reasons / explanations for delay has

also to be considered. I am of the considered view that

the applicant/appellant/defendant has duly explained

the delay. I am of the considered view that no

prejudice shall be cause to respondent in case the

delay    is    condoned.     Respondent      can     be     duly

compensated in terms of money. Considering the

                                                   Contd.........
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                             -9-</span><p id="p_35">

record in totality it shows that the bonafide of the

appellant/applicant. The facts laid before the court

show desire of applicant/appellant/defendant, the

appellant herein to exercise its statutory rights.



</p><p id="p_36">15.       The authorities relied by Ld. Counsel for

respondent are not disputed but with due respect in the

facts and circumstances of this case these are

differentiable and of no help to the respondent.



</p><p id="p_37">16.       Therefore, from all this I am of the considered

view that the delay has duly been explained and

''sufficient cause'' has been explained for delay in filing

the   present   appeal.       Accordingly,     the   present

application is allowed, subject to cost of Rs. 1500/- to be

paid to respondent.       The delay in filing the present

appeal is accordingly condoned.

and arguments on the main appeal on 29.08.2008.
