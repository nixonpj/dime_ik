<p id="p_249">                          02. These appeals have been filed by the State of

          Bihar assailing the impugned judgment dated 13.04.2017,

          whereby the learned Single Judge has allowed the writ petitions

          filed by the 28 respondent-petitioners in all the appeals setting

          aside their termination orders on the post of Teachers of

          Government run Middle Schools in the district of Siwan. The

          respondent-petitioners were applicants for appointment as

          Teachers against an advertisement that was published on

          09.08.1988 pursuant whereto selections were held between

          1989-90 and appointments were made in the year 1991. The

          selections, therefore, relate to an almost three decade old

          matter, the dispute whereof came to be raised in the year 2001

          when certain non-selected teachers staked their claim before

          this Court.

<p id="p_250">                          03. There is no dispute between the parties that the

          selections and appointments were to be made in accordance

          with the State Basic Schools (Classification, Appointment,

          Promotion and Transfer of Assistant Teachers) Rules, 1975

<p id="p_272">                          09. The Principal Secretary of the Department

          concerned constituted a Three Member Committee to look into

          the findings of the vigilance report and to proceed in

          accordance with law. The Three Member Committee submitted

          a report dated 21.02.2014 which ultimately came to it's own

          findings in tune with the vigilance report that the respondent-

<p id="p_273">          petitioners had succeeded in getting themselves selected from

          amongst the panel of the teachers on the strength of inflated

          marks that were depicted against their candidature for which

          different methods were adopted, thereby pushing down the

          meritorious candidates who were eliminated and in their place

          the respondent-petitioners who had lesser marks got themselves

          selected.

          accepted, disciplinary proceedings were initiated by issuing

          show-cause notices and calling for a reply from the petitioners

          and thereafter an inquiry was held. Upon the submission of the

          Inquiry Report, a second show-cause notice was issued to the

          respondent-petitioners,           whereafter   their   services   were

<p id="p_275">                          11. The appellant-State and its authorities came to

          the conclusion that on account of the inflation of marks

          candidates who were better in merit were eliminated and the

          respondent-petitioners with the aid of wrong marks being

          reflected against their names succeeded in getting themselves

          appointed. It was also found that had this manipulation not been

          carried out in the reflection of marks of the respondent-

<p id="p_276">          petitioners, they would have not been placed amongst the 150

<p id="p_277">                          12. We may mention here that a panel of 903

          candidates had been prepared, but appointments had to be made

          only against 150 available posts. Thus, the merit as against150

          posts had to be prepared and appointments were to be made

          accordingly.

          Bihar contends that the fact that incorrect marks were reflected

          conclusion drawn by the inquiring agency is correct. Since

          there was no other conclusion possible, the Disciplinary

          Authority rightly formed the opinion that the services of the

          respondent-petitioners deserve to be terminated.

          in the writ petitions giving rise to these appeals on the ground

          that the impugned orders are in violation of principles of natural

          justice, inasmuch as, copies of the documents including the

          Inquiry Report were not supplied to the respondent-petitioners

          so as to give them a fair opportunity to defend themselves. It

          was, therefore, held by the learned Single Judge that since the

          procedure meant for departmental proceedings including Rule

          17 and 18 of the Bihar CCA Rules was not followed, hence the

          Inquiry was vitiated. It is also evident that the learned Single

          Judge came to the conclusion that no reasons have been given

          as to why the objections raised by the respondent-petitioners

          about non-supply of documents was not tenable. The learned

          Single Judge found several procedural flaws in the inquiry and

          also held that there was no supporting evidence so as to

          attribute any fraud or misrepresentation on the part of the

          respondent-petitioners and consequently, all the termination

          orders were invalidated by observing as under:-

<p id="p_309">                          15. Learned counsel for the appellant-State of

          Bihar contends that when the primary fact relating to an

          erroneous description of marks has been established, then the

          observation made by the learned Single Judge that the primary

          case was one of inter se merit is not correct. This was a case

          where the respondent-petitioners had entered into service on the

          basis of a manipulated merit chart with the aid of which they

          achieved their ends. This, therefore, is a case of fraud and

          misrepresentation and not a case of mistake which could have

          been regularised or can be corrected even now. It is in this

          background that the State of Bihar contends that the learned

          Single Judge has committed an error in allowing the writ

          petitions that too even without remanding the matter back for

          filling up the gaps in the inquiry proceedings.

          learned counsel for the respondent-petitioners have virtually

          adopted the same line of arguments contending that the

          appellant-State had not followed the procedure prescribed in

          law and there was no material to support the conclusion so as to

          form any adverse opinion against the respondent-petitioners on

          the basis of material found. Thus, since there was no evidence

          to establish the involvement of the respondent-petitioners, the

          learned Single Judge was justified in quashing the termination

          orders. It is also submitted on behalf of the respondent-

<p id="p_311">          petitioners that almost 30 years have passed by and some of the

          teachers are now about to complete their career, in such

          circumstances, this Court should not interfere with the orders of

          the learned Single Judge and they should be allowed to

          continue in the service. It is their contention that the

          proceedings were not in accordance with the directions

          contained in the judgment dated 25.07.2012. Learned counsel

          for the respondent-petitioners have relied on Rule 17 (23)(ii)

          and Rule 18(2) of the CCA Rule, 2005 to contend that no

          reason for disagreement with the findings arrived at by the

          Vigilance Department and the Three Member Committee has

          been recorded. To support the submission, reliance has been

          placed on Paragraphs 10, 13 and 14 of the judgment in the case

          documents and also the inquiry report has also been asserted for

          which reliance is placed on the judgments in the case of <a href="/doc/1345620/" id="a_6">State

</p>
<p id="p_313">                          17. We have considered the submissions raised and

          we find that this dispute arose on account of a direction issued

          by the High Court on 24.08. 2011 and the judgment dated

          25.07.2012. The said orders have become final and have not

          been challenged by anybody. Thus, any passage of time after

          the appointment of the respondent-petitioners cannot be a

          ground to construe that the exercise undertaken was belated or

          cannot be scrutinized due to a long lapse of time. Apart from

          this, two inquiries were held, one by the Vigilance Department
 Patna High Court L.P.A No.109 of 2018 dt.12-07-2019
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_45">                                            44/49</span>




          and the other by the Three Member Inquiry Committee where

          the respondent-petitioners did submit their reply.
</p>
<p id="p_314">                          18. One thing is certain that the respondent-
</p>
<p id="p_315">          petitioners have also not been able to successfully deny the fact

          that their marks were wrongly depicted in the panel prepared by

          the office. The stand of the respondent-petitioners is that such

          mistake was either a clerical or a typographical or a mistake

          which was only attributable to the office of the employers and

          which nowhere reflects any manipulation or fraud on the part of

          the respondent-petitioners.
</p>
<p id="p_316">                          19. The Inquiry Reports reflect the manipulation

          of marks only in the panel-list and there is no evidence of the

          respondent-petitioners having furnished fake mark-sheets or

          any wrong information about their actual marks but the fact

          remains that all the respondent-petitioners are beneficiaries of

          the said manipulated transaction.
</p>
<p id="p_317">                          20. It is here that we would like to comment upon

          the nature of the mistakes that have been reflected in the inquiry

          reports. A mistake is an error or a wrong estimate or fault in

          thought or inaction on account of any misunderstanding or

          misconception. What would amount to an inadvertent mistake

          is another aspect. A typographical mistake can be inadvertent
 Patna High Court L.P.A No.109 of 2018 dt.12-07-2019
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_46">                                            45/49</span>




          and this what the respondent-petitioners assert but the manner

          in which the marks have been varied in the panel-list are in

          great contrast to the actual marks of the respondent-petitioners.
</p>
<p id="p_318">          The mistakes are therefore not inadvertent or typographical.
</p>
<p id="p_319">          They are calculative mistakes that have been inserted with a

          view to alter the position of merit and are not typing mistakes.
</p>
<p id="p_320">          The mistakes in the panel are evident as the respondent-
</p>
<p id="p_321">          petitioners themselves have taken a stand that they are not

          responsible for the mistakes as reflected in the panel-list. The

          respondent-petitioners have tried to shift the entire burden on

          the officials who may have prepared the panel-list and on whom

          the allegation is of having committed that mistake. The

          respondent-petitioners therefore have attempted to absolve

          themselves of any act of guilt on their part.
</p>
<p id="p_322">                          21. We find that the respondent-petitioners are the

          beneficiaries feigning ignorance about the depiction of such

          marks in the panel-list. They all contend that they have no

          knowledge as to how and when such mistakes occurred and

          they were not even brought to the notice of respondent-
</p>
<p id="p_323">          petitioners at any stage. It is therefore submitted on their behalf

          that if there was no knowledge to the respondent-petitioners

          about the said alleged mistakes then in that event no guilt can

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_47">                                            46/49</span>




          be attributed to them.
</p>
<p id="p_324">                          22. The question can be answered on the basis of

          the surrounding circumstances where the respondent-petitioners

          are beneficiaries. The respondent-petitioners had knowledge

          about their selection and,                therefore, an inference can be

          reasonably drawn and gathered from surrounding circumstances

          that the respondent-petitioners were at least having constructive

          knowledge of the selections on the basis of a panel that upon

          inquiry has been established to have been wrongly drawn up.
</p>
<p id="p_325">          To contend that they had no knowledge about the reflection of

          wrong marks would amount to infer a conduct against the

          ordinary course of things. However, inference on the basis of

          such evidence must be carefully distinguished from conjectures

          or mere speculation. An inference should not be drawn on the

          basis of strenuous exercise in order to prove something which

          otherwise may not exist but the objective facts of this case

          particularly the wrong reflection of marks is a strong

          circumstance which does not appear to be disputed by the

          respondent-petitioners. To the contrary, the respondent-
</p>
<p id="p_326">          petitioners are confident of even getting selected if the marks

          are correctly revised and placed in the panel.
</p>
<p id="p_327">                          23. The argument of the respondent-petitioners is
 Patna High Court L.P.A No.109 of 2018 dt.12-07-2019
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_48">                                            47/49</span>




          that if the entire merit list is re-looked into as directed in the

          judgment dated 25.07.2012 it is quite possible that even with

          the correct marks the respondent-petitioners would succeed in

          getting selected. This exercise according to them has not been

          undertaken and which we find is not in accordance with the

          directions issued by this Court or the rules of inquiry. The

          procedure appears to have been violated, inasmuch as, the

          respondent-petitioners were admittedly not given a complete

          copy of the Inquiry Report and the second show-cause notice

          only mentioned a gist of the charges that were found to be

          proved. In a couple of cases notices were not properly served.
</p>
<p id="p_328">          The appellants should have been provided the complete copy of

          the Inquiry Report relating to each of the candidates in order to

          enable them to set up their defence. The final authority that has

          proceeded to terminate the services of the respondent-
</p>
<p id="p_329">          petitioners ought to have been more specific about the

          involvement of the respondent-petitioners when the charge was

          one of alleged manipulation. The reason also, to establish the

          nexus of the respondent-petitioners with the Officers of the

          Department, has to be recorded on the basis of evidence by

          passing a speaking order. This was necessary in order to find

          out     the      involvement          of    the   respondent-petitioners.
 Patna High Court L.P.A No.109 of 2018 dt.12-07-2019
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_49">                                            48/49</span>




          Consequently, the procedure having been violated, the findings

          arrived at with regard to the correctness or otherwise of the

          merit position of the respondent-petitioners cannot be said to be

          wrong in its entirety unless it can be shown that all the

          respondent-petitioners would fall outside the limit of 150 posts

          against which employment had been sought.
</p>
<p id="p_330">                          24. Accordingly to our mind, once the learned

          Single Judge was of the opinion that there was a procedural

          violation, then in that event, the matter ought to have been

          remitted back to the same authority to examine the facts as

          alleged by the respondent-petitioners after providing the

          documents that were relevant namely the Inquiry Report and

          the letters of appointment etc. before proceeding to terminate

          the services of the respondent-petitioners.
</p>
<p id="p_331">                          25. In the light of above, we agree with the

          findings of the learned Single Judge that there were procedural

          violations, but in view of the fact that the respondent-petitioners

          were beneficiaries of a selection on account of incorrect

          depiction of marks, the authorities ought to have put the

          respondent-petitioners to notice about such facts including the

          Inquiry Report before having proceeded to terminate their

          services. The appeals are, therefore, disposed of by modifying

                     the order of the learned Single Judge to the effect that the

                     appellants shall now afford a fresh opportunity to the

                     respondent-petitioners to give a reply to all the allegations after

                     supplying them a copy of the Inquiry Report by giving a fresh
