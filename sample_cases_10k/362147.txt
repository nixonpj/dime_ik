         ======================================
                      W.P.(C)No.36851 of 2008
          ======================================
             Dated this the 15th day of December 2008

                             JUDGMENT
</pre>

<p id="p_1">        Heard Smt.Sreedevi Kylasanath, the learned counsel

appearing for the petitioner and Smt.Anu Sivaraman, the learned

Government Pleader appearing for the respondents.

</p><p id="p_2">   2. The petitioner is presently working as Head Warder in the

District Jail at Kollam. While the petitioner was working as Warder

in the Central Prison at Thiruvananthapuram, he along with seven

others was placed under suspension by Ext.P1 order dated

17.7.1990. The disciplinary action initiated against them was

finalised by Ext.P6 order passed on 4.2.1991. By the said order,

the Deputy Inspector General of Prisons imposed on the petitioner

the punishment of barring of three increments with cumulative

effect. The petitioner challenged Ext.P6 in appeal before the

Inspector General of Prisons. By Ext.P8 order passed on 29.8.1997

the said appeal was dismissed. Two of the Warders, who were also

punished along with the petitioner by Ext.P6 order dated

4.2.1991, had likewise moved the Inspector General in appeal.

When their appeals were rejected, they filed O.P.No.21021 of

1997 in this Court. By Ext.P10 judgment delivered on 25.9.2006,

this Court quashed the orders passed by the appellate authority

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">W.P.(C)No.36851 of 2008        2</span>

  and directed reconsideration of the appeals. The petitioner

  submits that pursuant to the directions issued by this Court in

  Ext.P10 judgment, the Director General of Police (Prisons) passed

  Ext.P11 order dated 15.3.2007 exonerating them of the charges.

  Relying on Ext.P11, the petitioner moved the Director General of

  Police (Prisons) by submitting Ext.P12 and thereafter moved the

  Secretary to Government, Department of Home Affairs in Ext.P14

  representation dated 17.11.2008. In the said representations, he

  pointed out that as he and the beneficiaries of Ext.P11 were

  proceeded against for the same set of charges, in view of the

  finding in Ext.P11, he is also entitled to be exonerated of the

  charges. In this Writ Petition the petitioner inter alia prays for a

  direction to the Secretary to Government, Department of Home

  Affairs to consider Ext.P14 representation and pass orders

  thereon after affording him an opportunity of being heard.

</p><p id="p_3">      3. Ext.P11 discloses that the disciplinary action which lead to

  Ext.P6 that was upheld by the appellate authority in Ext.P8, was

  not held in accordance with the procedure prescribed in the

  Kerala Police Departmental Inquiries, Punishment and Appeal

  Rules 1958. As a matter of      fact Ext.P11 discloses     that the

  preliminary enquiry was conducted by the appellate authority and

  punishment imposed by the Deputy Inspector General of Prisons

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">W.P.(C)No.36851 of 2008        3</span>

  who is a lower authority. The Director General of Prisons has also

  held that no Enquiry Officer was appointed, the employees were

  not given permission to cross examine witnesses, that they were

  not given an opportunity to deny their guilt and establish their

  innocence and that principles of natural justice were not followed

  in the enquiry. A reading of Ext.P11 indicates that the Director

  General of Prisons has found gross irregularity in the proceedings

  which lead to imposition of punishment on the petitioner and

  other officers who were found guilty and punished as per Ext.P6

  order. In these circumstances, I am of the considered opinion that

  though the petitioner did not challenge Ext.P8 in time, the

  request made by him in Ext.P14 deserves to be examined by the

  Government invoking the power under Rule 36A of the Kerala

  Police Departmental Enquiries, Punishment and Appeal Rules.

</p><p id="p_4">       I accordingly dispose of this Writ Petition with a direction to

  the Secretary to Government, Department of Home Affairs to

  consider Ext.P14 representation and pass orders thereon having

  regard to the observations and findings in Ext.P11 order passed

  by the Director General of Police (Prisons) and pass orders

  thereon, after affording the petitioner an opportunity of being

  heard. It will be open to the petitioner to supplement Ext.P14 by

  filing a further representation. Final orders in the matter shall be

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">W.P.(C)No.36851 of 2008       4</span>

  passed within four months from the date on which the petitioner

  produces a certified copy of this judgment.
