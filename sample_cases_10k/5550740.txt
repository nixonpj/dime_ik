<p id="p_1">                 The  appellant has filed present appeal under Section 

9 of the Public Premises (Eviction of Unauthorized Occupants) Act, 

1971 (hereinafter   referred to as "the PP Act"), against the eviction 

order dated 31.01.2014 passed by the Estate Officer.


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">PPA No.14/2014              Pratap Singh Vs. DDA             Page 1 of 18</span>
 2                 I have heard learned counsels for the parties and have 

carefully gone through the entire material on record.

3                 Facts emerging out from the present appeal are that 

13344 Bigha of land belonging to the Delhi Improvement Trust was 

allotted   to   Delhi   Peasants   Co­operative   Multipurpose   Society   Ltd. 

(hereinafter referred to as the Society) vide Resolution No.157 dated 

29.06.1949   in   villages  Patparganj   Shamspur,   Jatwara  Kalan   South, 

Gaonwala, Mohammad Khan Wala, Jhilmil Tahirpur South, Jhilmil 

Tahirpur North and Murgi Khana.  The Society alloted the aforesaid 

land to its members who were cultivating the same since its allotment. 

The Society allotted 8 bigha of land situated in Khasra No.71 min, 

revenue estate of Chiragaha Janubi to the appellant being its member. 

The Society had been regularly paying land revenue.  On 31.07.1967, 

letter was issued by DDA to the Society vide which the Society was 

asked to hand over the possession of land not later than 05.08.1967. 

Thereafter, the Society filed a suit for restraining the DDA to give 

effect to letter dated 31.07.1967.   The said suit filed by the Society 

was dismissed.  Thereafter, the Society filed an appeal before Hon'ble 

High Court bearing RFA No.250/1971 in which statement was made 

by counsel for the DDA to the effect that the appellant would not be 


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">PPA No.14/2014               Pratap Singh Vs. DDA                  Page 2 of 18</span>
 dispossessed without following the due process of law.  Accordingly, 

the said appeal was disposed off.  A notice was issued to the Society 

as to why an eviction order may not be passed.  Thereafter, DDA filed 

an   eviction   petition   against   the   Society   and  the  Ld. Estate  Officer 

passed the eviction order dated 01.08.2007.  The said eviction order 

was challenged by the Society by filing an appeal before this Court. 

The Court vide judgment dated 1.9.2009 set aside the eviction order 

passed by Estate Officer while observing that the description of land 

was   not   mentioned   therein   and   matter   was   remanded   back   to   the 

Estate   Officer   with   the   directions   to   pass   order   afresh   clearly 

specifying/showing   the   description   of   land   for   which   the   eviction 

order   was   passed.     Thereafter,   the   appellant   received   show   cause 

notice   under   section   4   of   the   PP   Act   which   was   replied   and 

proceedings were initiated.     Before the Ld. Estate Officer, both the 

parties  adduced  evidence  in  support  of  their  case.    Thereafter, Ld. 

Estate Officer passed impugned order dated 31.01.2014 u/s 5(1) of the 

PP Act, declaring the appellant, as unauthorized occupant, which has 

been challenged by way of present appeal.
</p>
<pre id="pre_2">4                  The   impugned   order   has   been   challenged   on   the 

following grounds :­


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">PPA No.14/2014                Pratap Singh Vs. DDA                   Page 3 of 18</span>
</pre><p id="p_2"> (a)  No authorization/notification regarding  appointment of Estate  

Officer;
</p>
<p id="p_3">(b) Invalidity of show cause notice;  
</p>
<p id="p_4">(c) Non­determination of tenancy/lease of the Society; and 

</p><p id="p_5">(d) Denial of of fair opportunity.
</p>
<p id="p_6">5                 Ld.   Counsel   for   the   appellant   has   argued   that   the 

Estate Officer had no authority to initiate eviction proceedings and to 

pass eviction order as he was not appointed as per section 3 of the PP 

Act.  He has further argued that notice under section 4 of the PP Act 

was not  valid  as the details  of the exact  land in occupation  of the 

appellant was not mentioned therein.  He has further argued that lease 

of the Society has not been determined so far.  He further argued that 

statement   of   counsel   for   DDA   in   RFA   No.250/1971   has   not   been 

appreciated by the Estate Officer.  It has been argued that the Estate 

Officer wrongly observed that DDA had terminated the lease of the 

Society vide letter dated 31.07.1967.  He has further argued that land 

in question was allotted for agricultural purpose and lease could not 

be terminated before expiry of six months under <a href="/doc/80042/" id="a_1">section 106</a> of the 

Transfer of Property Act.   The Estate Officer has wrongly observed 

that payment of lease money by the Society was without any demand 


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">PPA No.14/2014                Pratap Singh Vs. DDA                    Page 4 of 18</span>
 from the DDA.  It has also been argued that as the appellant was not 

given opportunity to cross examine the witnesses of DDA, therefore, 

the principles of natural justice were flouted.
</p>
<p id="p_7">6                  On the other hand, it  has been argued by ld. Counsel 

for DDA that the Estate Officer was competent to adjudicate upon the 

present dispute as notification in this regard was published and same 

has been placed on record.  It has been further argued that the lease of 

the   Society   was   validly   determined   by   DDA   vide   letter   dated 

31.07.1967.    He has  further argued  that  appellant  was  served  with 

show cause notice which was valid one as specification of land in his 

possession was mentioned.  It has been argued that the tenancy of the 

appellant was not as per the provisions of Punjab Tenancy Act.

7                  To   appreciate   the   rival   contentions,   I   have   gone 

through   the   material   available   on   record.     First  contention  is  with 

regard to authority of the Estate Officer to adjudicate upon the dispute 

in the present  case.   Perusal  of the record shows that no objection 

with regard to authority of the Estate Officer to adjudicate upon the 

present dispute was raised by the appellant.  The appellant contested 

the   eviction   proceedings   but   no   objection   to   the   authority   of   the 

Estate   Officer   to   conduct   the   proceedings   was   raised.     Once   the 


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">PPA No.14/2014                 Pratap Singh Vs. DDA                     Page 5 of 18</span>
 authority of the Estate Officer remained unchallenged and pleadings 

and evidence was filed by the appellant before him, now the appellant 

can not take the ground that the Estate Officer had no authority  and 

that   too   after   passing   of   eviction   order.     This   contention   of   the 

appellant  appears to  be an afterthought  and there is no force in it. 

Moreover, the copy of notification No.916 dated 18.07.2001 has been 

produced on record by the DDA which shows that the Estate Officer 

was authorized to conduct the proceedings.
</p>
<p id="p_8">8                   Next   contention   raised   by   the   appellant   is   that   the 

show   cause   notice   did  not   contain  the  specification  of  the  land   in 

possession of the appellant, hence, same was defective.  Perusal of the 

show cause notice shows that land measuring 8 bigha in Khasra No.

71 min. was shown to be in possession of the appellant which was 

required to be evicted for the development of 'O' Zone/ channelization 

of   Yamuna   River   (Bio­diversity   park)   which   was  never   in   dispute 

during the proceedings.  In the show cause notice, the description of 

land in possession of the appellant was specifically mentioned.  It is 

also  mentioned  therein that  the land in question  is required by the 

DDA for the development of Bio­diversity park.  Therefore, there is 

no force in this contention of the appellant in as much as in the show 


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">PPA No.14/2014                  Pratap Singh Vs. DDA                     Page 6 of 18</span>
 cause notice the description of land is clearly mentioned for which he 

was called upon to show cause.  Therefore, it was a valid show cause 

notice.
</p>
<p id="p_9">9                  Next contention of the appellant is that the tenancy/ 

lease of the Society has not yet been determined and the letter dated 

31.07.1967  can  not  be  said to  have  been  issued  for determination/ 

cancellation   of   lease   deed.     Perusal   of  record   shows   that  the   land 

including the land in question was placed at the disposal of the then 

Delhi Improvement  Trust  vide agreement  dated 31.03.1937 entered 

into between the Trust and the Secretary of State of India in Council. 

It is also matter of record that the Trust leased out the land to the 

Society   vide   resolution   No.157   dated   29.06.1949.     As   per   this 

resolution, the terms and conditions of the lease were finalized.   As 

per lease deed, the period of lease at the instance was for 5 years.  It is 

also   matter   of   record   that   the   Delhi   Improvement   Trust   has   been 

succeeded by the Delhi Development Authority.  There is no dispute 

in this regard that ownership of land leased out to the Society stood 

transferred to the DDA.

<p id="p_11">11                  Letter dated 31.07.1967 vide which the lease/tenancy 

of the appellants was determined, reads as under :­

             "Whereas the term of lease of Nazul land situated in 
             Estates  of Inderprastha, Bela, Chiragah North and

             but   not   later   than   5th  of  August   to  the  Tehsildar

</p><p id="p_12">12                  The above­quoted letter dated 31.07.1967 was issued 

to  the  Secretary  of  the  Society  informing  him  that  the  lease  stood 

expired by issuance of said letter and he was asked to hand over the 

possession of land leased out to the appellant Society by 05.08.1967. 

In   this   letter,   it   was   specifically   mentioned   that   lease   of   the   land 

granted   to   the   Society   ended   in   June,   1966   which   clearly   goes   to 

prove that lease of the Society expired by efflux of time as no renewal

 of the lease was made by the DDA for the period beyond June, 1966. 

By   issuance   of   this   letter,   the   tenancy/lease   of   the   Society   was 

determined by the DDA. 
</p><p id="p_13">13                 I have gone through the ratio of judgment in case of 

<a href="/doc/453977/" id="a_2">Ashoka   Marketing   Ltd.   &amp;   Anr.   vs.   Punjab   National   Bank   and  

others</a>  AIR   1991   SC   855   in   which   the   unauthorized   occupant   as 

defined  in  section  2(g)  of  the  PP Act  has  been elaborated.   While 

dealing   with   this   aspect,   it   was   observed   that   the   definition   of 

unauthorized occupant covers a case where a person has entered into 

occupation of the Public Premises legally as a tenant under a lease but 

whose tenancy has expired or has been determined in accordance with 

law.  The second part of the definition as contained in <a href="/doc/1920937/" id="a_3">section 2(g)</a> is 

inclusive in nature and it expressly covers continuance in occupation 

by any person of the Public Premises after the authority under which 

he   was   allowed   to   occupy   the   premises   has   expired   or   has   been 

determined.

stood   terminated/determined.     After   determination   of   lease   by 

respondent, the appellant became unauthorized occupant as defined in 

section 2(g) of the PP Act inasmuch as right to use the said land by 

appellant flows from the rights of the Society.
</p>
<p id="p_15">15                 Next contention raised by the appellant is that lease 

could   not   have   been   terminated   by   the   DDA   before   expiry   of   six 

months as mandated in <a href="/doc/80042/" id="a_4">Section 106</a> of the Transfer of Property Act, 

1882 in as much as the land in question is agricultural land.  On the 

other hand,  it  has been contended  by ld counsel  for the DDA that 

<a href="/doc/80042/" id="a_5">section  106</a>  of the Transfer of Property Act is not applicable in as 

much as there is a special statute under which lease of the Society was 

determined.
</p>
<p id="p_16">16                 The   appellant   was   present   during   proceedings   on 

15.05.2013   and   had   stated  that   he   would   act  as   per   advice   of  the 

Society and the statement of Baljeet Singh, General Secretary of the 

Society was recorded on 14.10.2013.  In his statement, Baljeet Singh 

has stated that he was not aware whether the Society had received 

letter dated 31.07.1967 whereby the Society was informed regarding 


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">PPA No.14/2014                 Pratap Singh Vs. DDA                    Page 10 of 18</span>
 cancellation/determination  of  lease  and  was  asked  to  surrender  the 

possession by 05.08.1967.  Admittedly the rights of the occupant flow 

from the Society which was asked to surrender the possession.

17               After   going   through   the   rival   contentions   of   the 

parties on this point, I have gone through the ratio of judgment of the 

Apex Court in case of  <a href="/doc/1689520/" id="a_6">Cantonment Board and Another vs. Church  

of North India</a> AIR 2011 SC 2339.  Facts of the said case were that 

lease deed between the parties was not a registered lease deed as was 

necessary under <a href="/doc/515323/" id="a_7">Section 107</a> of the Transfer of Property Act.  In the 

said case, there was 7 days notice of termination of lease.  It was held 

by  the  Apex  Court  that  provisions  of  <a href="/doc/80042/" id="a_8">sections  106</a>  and  <a href="/doc/515323/" id="a_9">107</a>  of  the 

Transfer of Property Act could not be applied to the said case since 

the premises were covered under a special Act which will prevail as 

against a general enactment.   It was also observed that the Division 

Bench of the High Court erred in insisting that a 15 days' notice was 

necessary.  
</p><p id="p_17">18               In   the   present   case,   lease   of   the   Society   was 

determined/terminated   by   the   DDA   vide   letter   dated   31.07.1967 

whereby calling upon it to hand over the possession by 05.08.1967. 

As per the law of land in Cantonment Board's case(supra), since the 


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">PPA No.14/2014              Pratap Singh Vs. DDA                 Page 11 of 18</span>
 land   in   question   is   covered   under  special  Act  i.e.  Public  Premises 

(Eviction   of   Unauthorized   Occupants)   Act,   1971,   the   general 

enactment i.e. <a href="/doc/80042/" id="a_10">Section 106</a> of the Transfer of Property Act will not be 

applicable  in  the present  case.   So, there was no necessity  to give 

notice under <a href="/doc/80042/" id="a_11">section 106</a> of the Transfer of Property Act by giving six 

months   time   to   the   appellant   to   hand   over   the   possession.     Even 

otherwise, the tenancy/lease of the land in question was in favour of 

the Society and there was no transfer of land in question as per the 

Punjab Tenancy Act in favour of the appellant by the Society.   The 

possession of land in favour of the appellant was the internal matter 

as he was alloted  the land being member of the Society.   There is 

force in the contention of the ld. Counsel for DDA that the tenancy/ 

lease in favour of the appellant was not as per law.  It has been shown 

on  record  that   the  lease/tenancy  of the Society  was determined  by 

DDA vide letter dated 31.07.1967 and it was asked to hand over the 

possession of leased out land by 05.08.1967.  Since the lease/tenancy 

of the Society was not extended, the appellant become unauthorized 

occupant of the land in question.

<p id="p_18">19                 I have gone through the ratio of judgment in case of 

Syndicate Bank Vs.  Ramachandran  Pillai  and Ors.  2011(1) Scale 


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">PPA No.14/2014                 Pratap Singh Vs. DDA                   Page 12 of 18</span>
</p><p id="p_19"> 368.  Facts of the case were that the appellant bank was the owner of 

a shop and one Ramakrishna Pillai was the tenant in occupation of the 

said   premises   till   1997.   In  the   year  1998,  appellant  bank   issued  a 

notice terminating the tenancy and called upon Ramakrishna Pillai to 

vacate the premises.  As he failed to vacate, action was taken against 

him under the PP Act.  The Supreme Court upheld the eviction order 

of   the   Estate   Officer   by   declaring   his   legal   representatives   as 

unauthorized occupants.

<p id="p_20">20                 In   the   present   case   also,   the   Society   which   was 

alloted the land in question was declared as an unauthorized occupant 

vide letter dated 31.07.1967 and then the Ld. Estate Officer passed the 

eviction order dated 31.01.2014.
</p>
<p id="p_21">21                 Next contention raised by the appellant is that he was 

not given  opportunity  to cross examine the witnesses  of the DDA. 

Perusal   of   record   shows   that   on   15.05.2013,   statements   of   Smt. 

Jacinta Tappo, Sh. Vijay Kumar and Sh. Kamal Singh on behalf of 

DDA were recorded.  On 14.10.2013, statement of Sh. Baljeet Singh, 

General  Secretary of the Society was recorded.   The appellant  had 

made the statement that he would act as per advice of the Society. 

This shows that both the parties were given due opportunity to adduce 


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">PPA No.14/2014                 Pratap Singh Vs. DDA                  Page 13 of 18</span>
 their evidence which they availed.  The witnesses of DDA were cross 

examined   by   the   counsel   for   the   Society.     After   conclusion   of 

evidence, the Estate Officer heard arguments of both sides and then 

passed the impugned order of eviction.    The appellant has failed to 

demonstrate from the record that principles of natural justice were not 

adhered to by the Estate Officer.
</p>
<p id="p_22">22                   The appellant has also raised the contention that the 

Ld. Estate Officer has not appreciated the statements of counsel for 

DDA made in RFA No.250/1971.  Perusal of statement made by the 

counsel   for   DDA   in   RFA   No.250/1971   shows   that   he   made   the 

statement that the appellant would not be dispossessed and amount 

would not be recovered except under the provisions of the PP Act.  It 

is a matter of record that thereafter proceedings were initiated against 

the   appellant   by   the   DDA  under  the  provisions  of   the  PP  Act  for 

which a notice to show cause under sub section (i) and clause (b)(ii) 

of   sub   section   (2)   of   section   4   of   the   PP   Act   was   issued   to   the 

appellant and thereafter eviction proceedings followed.  So, DDA has 

adopted   due   procedure   for   eviction   of   the   appellant   as   per   the 

provisions of the PP Act.
</p>
<p id="p_23">23                   In the present case, the lease was given to the Society 


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">PPA No.14/2014                   Pratap Singh Vs. DDA                       Page 14 of 18</span>
 for the period of 5 years.  As per condition of the lease, the land could 

have been sublet to members of the Society but rights of the members 

were restricted to rights of the Society.  In the present case, the lease 

was not extended by the Competent Authority and the Society was 

asked to surrender the possession of land vide letter dated 31.07.1967. 

The   Society   could   not   have   any   right   to   continue   in   possession 

thereafter   what   to   say   about   rights   of   the   appellant   who   had   just 

entered into the shoes of the Society for the limited purpose.  There 

was no tenancy agreement between the appellant and the Society and 

the   land   in   possession   of   the   appellant   was   alloted   to   him   being 

member of the Society.   Moreover, case of the appellant is that he 

agreed with the statement of Sh. Baljeet Singh, General Secretary of 

the Society.  
</p>
<p id="p_24">24                  In   view   of   discussion   made   above,   I   am   of   the 

considered opinion that there were sufficient grounds with the DDA 

to proceed for the eviction of the appellant which do not have any 

right   to   continue   in   possession   of   land   being   without   any 

authorization.  The Estate Officer was duly authorized to conduct the 

eviction proceedings as per the notification No.916 dated 18.07.2001. 

In the show cause notice issued to the appellant, description of land in 


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">PPA No.14/2014                  Pratap Singh Vs. DDA                    Page 15 of 18</span>
 his possession has specifically been mentioned.  It is also mentioned 

in the show cause notice that the land is now required by the DDA for 

the   development   of   Bio­diversity   park.     The   DDA   determined/ 

terminated  the lease   of the Society  vide letter dated 31.07.1967  in 

which it was asked to hand over the possession of the land in question 

to the DDA.   The lease of the Society was terminated by the DDA 

vide   letter   dated   31.07.1967   and   as   per   the   judgment   in   case   of 

Cantonment Board  (supra), there was no need to give six months' 

advance notice.  It has come on record that initially lease of the land 

in   question   was   given   to  the  Society  initially   for   a   period   of  five 

years.   The land was leased out with the condition that the Society 

may sublet the land to its members but the rights of the members were 

restricted  to the rights  of the Society.   The DDA vide letter dated 

31.07.1967 determined the lease of the Society and by the efflux of 

time also, the lease stood expired.   The Ld. Estate Officer has also 

followed  the principles  of natural  justice  as he had given both the 

parties opportunity to adduce evidence, which they duly availed.

25                  It is pertinent to mention that Public Premises Act has 

been enacted by the Parliament being a <a href="/doc/701797/" id="a_12">Special Act</a> which is intended 

to   deal   with   speedy   recovery   of   possession   of   premises   of   public

Companies in which the Central Governments has substantial interest 

or Corporations owned or controlled by the Central Government and 

certain   corporations,   institutions,   autonomous   bodies   and   local 

authorities.
</p>
<p id="p_25">26                 It   is   pertinent   to   mention   that   similar   appeal   titled 

<a href="/doc/176483534/" id="a_13">Rajinder Saini vs. DDA</a> was dismissed by this Court vide order dated 

07.03.2013.   Thereafter, the appellant preferred writ petition against 

the   dismissal   of   appeal   by   this   Court.   Hon'ble   High   Court   while 

deciding   writ   petition,   in  <a href="/doc/176483534/" id="a_14">Rajinder   Saini   and   Anr.   vs.   Delhi  

Development Authority</a>  2013 VII AD (Delhi) 16 has held that lease 

was granted to the society only for five years.   After expiry of five 

years, DDA asked the petitioners to vacate aforesaid land vide letter 

written to the society.  There was no implied extension of lease and 

that   possession   of   the   petitioners   after   that   letter   was   that   of 

unauthorized occupants within the meaning of <a href="/doc/1920937/" id="a_15">section 2</a> and Estate 

Officer was justified in directing their eviction from the said land.

27                 The   judgment   of  Rajinder   Saini's  case   (supra)   is 

squarely covered in the present case.  Consequently, in my considered 

opinion, the Ld. Estate Officer was competent to pass eviction order. 


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">PPA No.14/2014                 Pratap Singh Vs. DDA                      Page 17 of 18</span>
 He has followed the principles of natural justice while conducting the 

proceedings   and   then   passed   the   eviction   order.     It   has   been 

established   that   the   appellant   is   unauthorized   occupant   of   the 

government land which was leased out to the Society and the eviction 

order  was passed  as  per Section  5 of the PP  Act.   This being  the 

position, there is no substance in the grounds taken by the appellant. 

The period of authorization of the appellant to occupy the premises in 

question   was   determined   vide   letter   dated   31.07.1967   and   after 

determination of the lease, appellant was in unauthorized occupation 

under section 2(g) of the PP Act.  The appellant has failed to make out 

any ground in support of his appeal.  The eviction order passed by the 

Estate   Officer   dated   31.01.2014   is   hereby   upheld.   Appeal   is 

accordingly dismissed.

copy of the order. Appeal file be consigned to record room.
