              A.V.RAMAKRISHNA PILLAI, J
             ---------------------------------------------
                    WPC No.6870 of 2015
             ---------------------------------------------
           Dated this the 10th day of June, 2015

                             JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">     The petitioner has approached this Court against the

denial of building permit to construct an automobile

workshop in the property purchased by them as per Ext.P1

sale deed.
</p>
<p id="p_2">      2. The petitioner submitted Ext.P4 application for

building permit before the respondents which was

rejected by the third respondent stating that the property

is described as wet land in the revenue records. Ext.P5

order was set aside by this Court as per Ext.P6 judgment

and the second respondent was directed to consider

Ext.P4 application afresh. Accordingly, Ext.P4 application

was resubmitted along with a copy of Ext.P6 judgment.

After a lapse of about 8 months, the third respondent

issued Ext.P7 order rejecting Ext.P4 application again on

the ground that the 4th respondent to whom the said

application was forwarded for layout approval had

declined such approval vide Ext.P8 letter for the reason

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">WPC No.6870/2015         2</span>

that the proposed construction violates the zonal

regulations of Detailed Town Planning Scheme. According

to the 4th respondent the property in respect of which

Ext.P4 application was submitted is included in a paddy

field zone of a Town Planning Scheme.      It is with this

background, the petitioner has approached this Court.

</p><p id="p_3">     2. I have heard the learned counsel for the petitioner

and the learned standing counsel for the respondent

Municipality.
</p>
<p id="p_4">     3. It was pointed out by the learned counsel for the

petitioner that in the draft Data Bank pertaining to the

paddy and wet lands in Nattakam Village, Ext.P1 property

is described as land converted 8 years back.

</p><p id="p_5">      4. The decision of this Court in Mohammed Abdul

Basheer C.P. v State of Kerala and another (2012(3)

KLT 86) lays down the principle that the present position

of the land has to be taken into consideration and on

ascertaining these facts, permission can be granted for

construction.
</p>
<p id="p_6">      5. It can be seen from the documents that the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">WPC No.6870/2015          3</span>

property is not a paddy land and it is having full of aged

trees. It is settled position that the applicant can choose

the best land suited for construction             (Sunil v

Killimangalam-Panjal         5th    Ward     Nellulpadaka

Samooham 2012(4) KLT 511). Only if there is cultivation

presently then it will be considered as cultivating paddy

land so as to attract the provisions of the Kerala

Conservation of Paddy Land and Wetland Act and Rules.

</p><p id="p_7">     6. In Jalaja Dileep v Revenue Divisional Officer

(2012(3) KLT 333) this Court observed that the description

in the title deed or in revenue records will not be crucial if

the property is reclaimed already.
</p>
<p id="p_8">     7. The learned counsel invited my attention also to a

Division Bench decision of this Court in <a href="/doc/79993492/" id="a_1">Padmini v. State

of Kerala</a> [1999 (3) KLT 465] wherein it was held that no

building permit can be refused to any person because

there is a proposal to acquire the land in future. Reliance

was also placed to the decision of the Apex court in Raju

S. Jethmalani v. State of Maharastra [(2005) 11 SCC

222] wherein it was held that refusing to grant permits

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">WPC No.6870/2015          4</span>

relying on obsolete DTP schemes is a clear violation of the

provisions of the Constitution.
</p>
<p id="p_9">     Viewed in that profile, this Court is of the view that

the petitioner is entitled to get the reliefs prayed for.

Therefore, the writ petition is allowed. Ext.P4 is quashed

and the respondent Municipality is directed to reconsider

petitioner's application for building permit within a period

of one month from the date of receipt of a copy of this

judgment after making a local inspection of the

petitioner's property. If the respondent is satisfied that

the property is not fit for paddy cultivation in the present

form, building permit shall be granted to the petitioner

without raising any further objection.</p><pre id="pre_2">
