    THIS MFA COMING ON FOR ORDERS THIS DAY, THE
COURT DELIVERED THE FOLLOWING:


                      JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">      This appeal by the claimant is directed against the

judgment     and    award   in   MVC   No.71/10,   dated

30.07.2011 on the file the Civil Judge (Sr.Dn.) &amp; JMFC

&amp; MACT at Pandavapura, whereby the Tribunal has

awarded total compensation of Rs.5,18,499/- with

interest at 6% per annum from the date of the petition

till the date of deposit.
</p>
<p id="p_2">

</p><p id="p_3">       2. Learned Counsel for the appellant would

contend that claimant has sustained disability to the

extent of 40% to right lower limb and 50% to right

upper limb and 10% to left upper limb, together it

comes to 65% and 20% permanent disability to the

whole body. He was hospitalized for a period of 20 days.

The Tribunal has not awarded any compensation

towards loss of amenities or towards loss of future

medical expenses.

</p><p id="p_5">      3.   On   the   other       hand,   learned   Counsel

appearing for the respondent-Insurance Company has

sought to justify the impugned judgment and award.



</p><p id="p_6">     4.    I have carefully considered the arguments of

the learned Counsel made at the Bar and perused the

materials placed on record.
</p>
<p id="p_7">

</p><p id="p_8">     5. There is no dispute as to the occurrence of the

accident and the liability of the respondent-Insurance

Company to pay compensation. The only question for

consideration is as to whether the compensation

awarded by the Tribunal is adequate?


</p><p id="p_9">     6.    It is clear from the evidence of the doctor

that claimant had sustained 65% permanent disability

to the limbs and 20% disability to whole body.         The

Tribunal has not awarded any compensation towards

loss of amenities or towards loss of future medical

expenses. Having regard to the totality of the facts and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                            4</span>



circumstances of the case, it is just and proper to award

an     additional   sum    of      Rs.50,000/-    towards

compensation under these two heads.


</p><p id="p_10">       7. In the result, the appeal succeeds and it is

accordingly allowed in part. The respondent - Insurance

Company is directed to deposit an additional sum of

Rs.50,000/- with interest at 6% per annum from the

date of the application till the date of deposit within a

period of eight weeks from the date of receipt of a copy

of this order. The appellant is permitted to withdraw the

amount on its deposit. No costs.
