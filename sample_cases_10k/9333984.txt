   CORAM: HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE VIKASH JAIN
   ORAL JUDGMENT
    Date : 20-11-2018
                 The present writ petition has been filed for a direction to

   the respondents to grant subsidy on the purchase of one combined

   harvester to the petitioner; and for connected reliefs.

</p><p id="p_11">                 2. The short facts of the case according to the petitioner

   are that the petitioner applied for purchase of a combined harvester

   under Government scheme on 22.02.2010 (Annexure-1) before the

   Block Development Officer, Vijayipur. The Block Development

   Officer forwarded the petitioner's application on 08.03.2010

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                            2/5</span>




       (Annexure-2) to the Branch Manager, State Bank of India (for short

       "the SBI"), Kateya Branch, District Gopalganj. Upon verification the

       SBI sanctioned the loan with a limit of Rs. 11,00,000/- on

       13.01.2011 (Annexure-3) for purposes of purchase of the combined

       harvester. Accordingly, the petitioner purchased the combined

       harvester at a cost of Rs. 15,65,000/- as evident from the retail

       invoice dated 04.02.2011 (Annexure-4). The SBI then forwarded its

       letter dated 30.03.2011 (Annexure-5) to the District Agriculture

       Officer, Gopalganj enclosing the requisite documents with respect to

       claim for subsidy in accordance with the scheme.

</p><p id="p_12">                    3. Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that despite

       having complied with the terms and conditions of the Government

       scheme, the amount of subsidy in respect of purchase of the

       combined harvester has not been received by the petitioner. It

       appears that the subsidy has not been forthcoming in view of the

       guidelines vide memo no. 1191 dated 09.03.2011 issued by the

       Secretary, Agriculture, Bihar (Annexure-A to the counter affidavit)

       addressed to all the District Agriculture Officers directing that the

       subsidy amount for the financial year 2010-11 should not be paid in

       respect of purchase of agricultural equipment in the earlier

       financial years. It is submitted that the petitioner is eligible for

       grant of subsidy, considering that the equipment was duly

       purchased within the financial year 2010-11 and the SBI had

       already issued its forwarding letter together with all relevant

       documents to the District Agriculture Officer, Gopalganj vide its

       letter dated 30.03.2011 (Annexure-5) within the financial year

       2010-11 itself.
</p>
<p id="p_13">                    4. Learned senior counsel for the respondent-State

       appears and opposes the writ petition. A specific stand has been

       taken in para 5 of the counter affidavit to the effect that the letter of

       the SBI addressed to the District Agriculture Officer, Gopalganj was

       received in the next financial year 2011-12, namely, on 05.12.2011.

       He invites reference to the aforesaid letter dated 09.03.2011 and

       submits that in view of the bank's letter having been received in the

       next financial year the petitioner was not eligible for grant of

       subsidy.
</p>
<p id="p_14">                    5. Having heard the parties and on consideration of the

       materials on record, this Court finds merit in the writ petition. It is

       not in dispute that the petitioner duly fulfilled all the conditions

       required of him under the Government scheme. The petitioner

       admittedly applied for purchase of the combined harvester, which

       was forwarded by the Block Development Officer, the loan was

       sanctioned by the SBI, the combined harvester was purchased by

       the petitioner and finally the bank forwarded the relevant

       documents to the District Agriculture Officer, all of which was

       completed within the financial year 2010-11 itself. Even if the SBI's

       letter dated 30.03.2011 was received in the office of the District

       Agriculture Officer, Gopalganj in the subsequent financial year, it

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                            4/5</span>




       can be of little consequence. Reliance placed by learned counsel for

       the respondents on the guidelines dated 09.03.2011 in order to

       deny the claim for grant of subsidy to the petitioner is clearly

       untenable. A bare perusal of the said letter dated 09.03.2011

       discloses that the bar for the grant of subsidy relating to financial

       year 2010-11 was merely with reference to purchase of agricultural

       implements in the earlier financial years. In the instant case, the

       combined harvester was admittedly purchased in the financial year

       2010-11 itself.          The letter dated 09.03.2011 does not whisper

       anything with regard to intimation by the bank being received

       beyond the financial year 2010-11. The said guidelines are

       therefore inapplicable to the case of the petitioner and cannot come

       in his way for grant of subsidy. This view finds further support from

       the terms of the scheme (Annexure-A to the second supplementary

       counter affidavit) wherein it is stated under the heading "vkosnu dh

       izfdz;k" as follows -
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">                    "cSad }kjk _.k Lohd`fr dh frfFk dks vk/kkj ekudj

                    ftyk d`f'k inkf/kdkjh vuqnku dh jkf"k Lohd`r

                    djsaxsaA"</blockquote><p id="p_15">

</p><p id="p_16">                    6. In the above circumstances the concerned respondents

       are directed to ensure that the subsidy amount in question be

       released to the SBI for being disbursed to the petitioner in respect

       of the combined harvester purchased by the petitioner during the

       financial year 2010-11 expeditiously and in any event within a

                    period of eight weeks from the date of receipt/production of a copy

                    of this judgment. The SBI shall also ensure disbursement of the

                    subsidy amount to the petitioner within a period of two weeks from

                    the date of receipt of the subsidy amount from the State-

                    respondents.
