Judgment on                      : April 1, 2016

DEBANGSU BASAK, J.:-
</p>
<p id="p_2">      Does the Minority Commission established under the National

Commission for <a href="/doc/1361927/" id="a_1">Minority Educational Institutions Act</a>, 2004 have

original jurisdiction to grant declaration of status is one of the issues

coming up for considerations in the four writ petitions along with one

connected       application.     They   have   been   taken   up   for   hearing

analogously as they involve substantially the same issues.



</p><p id="p_3">      W.P. No. 12033 (W) of 2013, W.P. No. 12040 (W) of 2013 and W.P.

No. 12036 (W) of 2013 are writ petitions filed by three teachers of a

college complaining that the college is not a minority institution.

According to the teachers, the Governing Body which had resolved to

suspend them and to initiate disciplinary proceedings against them had

no jurisdiction to do so as such the Governing Body was not

constituted in accordance with the First Statutes of Calcutta University.
</p><p id="p_4">      The fourth writ petition being W.P. No. 24847 (W) of 2015 is a

petition filed by the college seeking a declaration that the college was

declared as a minority institution.
</p>
<p id="p_5">

</p><p id="p_6">     It has been contended on behalf of the teachers that, the college

has not been declared as a minority institution by the competent

authority under the provisions of the National Commission for <a href="/doc/1361927/" id="a_2">Minority

Educational Institutions Act</a>, 2004. The declaration that has been made

by the Minority Commission on October 13, 2008 is without

jurisdiction.   The   Minority   Commission     does   not   have   original

jurisdiction to declare an institution as a minority institution at the first

instance. A competent authority established under the provisions of the

National Commission for <a href="/doc/1361927/" id="a_3">Minority Educational Institutions Act</a>, 2004

has not declared the college to be a minority institution. In support of

the contention that the Commission does not have original jurisdiction

to declare any institution as a minority institution at the first instance

reliance has been placed on 2008 Volume 2 Calcutta High Court

Notes page 530 (Kiran Subbha &amp; Ors. v. State of West Bengal &amp;

Ors.) and an unreported decision of a Single Bench rendered in W.P.

No. 4406 (W) of 2010 with W.P. No. 5002 (W) of 2010. The declaration of

the college as a minority institution made by the Minority Commission
 on October 13, 2008 is, therefore, bad in law. The subsequent

communication of the State Government stating that since the Minority

Commission has declared the college to be a minority institution the

State has nothing to do with the matter, according to the petitioners,

are also without any jurisdiction as the State Government is relying

upon the initial declaration of the Minority Commission. Such initial

declaration is bad in law, therefore, the subsequent actions taken by

the State Government pursuant thereto is also bad in law. All actions

taken by the college and the authorities treating the college as a

minority institution is bad in law.
</p>
<p id="p_7">

</p><p id="p_8">     Since the college is not a minority institution the Governing Body

of the college has to be constituted in accordance with the First

Statutes of Calcutta University. Admittedly, the Governing Body which

has resolved to suspend the teachers and to initiate disciplinary

proceedings against them has not been constituted in accordance with

the First Statutes of Calcutta University. Referring to the letter dated

July 16, 2012 issued by the Calcutta University replacing two

Governing Body members of the college, it has been submitted on

behalf of the petitioners that, the college authorities did not allow the

new nominees of Calcutta University to function as a Governing Body
 members. Consequently, the resolution of the Governing Body dated

February 3, 2013 suspending the three teachers is bad in law.



</p><p id="p_9">     It has been contended on behalf of the college authorities that, the

college has been declared to be a minority institution by the Minority

Commission on October 13, 2008. Such declaration is valid. A Minority

Commission has the jurisdiction to declare an institution as a minority

institution under the provisions of <a href="/doc/45723846/" id="a_4">Section 11(f)</a> of the Act of 2004. A

distinction has been sought to be made between an institution which

was already established a minority institution prior to coming into the

effect of the Act of 2004 and an institution which is proposed to be

established after the coming into effect of the Act of 2004. In the first

scenario the Minority Commission has the original jurisdiction while in

the second scenario the competent authority under the Act of 2004 has

the original jurisdiction.
</p>
<p id="p_10">

</p><p id="p_11">     Learned Advocate for the college authorities has relied upon 1998

Volume 6 Supreme Court Cases page 674 (<a href="/doc/146760/" id="a_5">N. Ammad v. Manager,

Emjay High School &amp; Ors</a>.) in support of the proposition that, once an

institution is a minority institution it is so from the date of its

establishment notwithstanding the subsequent declaration as such by
 a competent authority. Applying such ratio in the present case,

according to him, the college is a minority institution since the date of

its establishment which is much prior to the date of declaration being

October 13, 2008. Learned Advocate for the college authorities had

submitted that since the institution is a minority institution it is

governed by its own constitution. He has referred to the constitution of

the institution for composition of the governing body. Referring to the

various provisions therein, he has submitted that, the governing body

which has resolved to suspend the three teachers and proceed against

them in a disciplinary proceeding was validly constituted. The order of

suspension is, therefore, valid. The college authorities ought to be

permitted to continue with the disciplinary proceedings in accordance

with law.
</p>
<p id="p_12">

</p><p id="p_13">     Referring to 2005 Volume 6 Supreme Court Cases page 404

(<a href="/doc/682526/" id="a_6">ICICI Bank &amp; Anr. v. Municipal Corporation of Greater Bombay &amp;

Ors</a>.),   1992   Volume     4   Supreme     Court    Cases   page    363

(Commissioner of Income Tax v Sun Engineering Works (P) Ltd.)

and 2008 Volume 14 Supreme Court Cases page 283 (<a href="/doc/1863541/" id="a_7">Pradip J.

Mehta v. Commissioner of Income Tax, Ahmedabad</a>) learned

Advocate for the college authorities has submitted that, the ratio of the
 judgments alone is a binding precedent. A ratio of a judgment has to be

ascertained by analyzing all the material facts and issues involved in

the case and argued on the both sides. The decision should be read

with reference to and in the context of the particular statutory provision

interpreted by the Court. Consequently, Kiran Subbha &amp; Ors. (supra)

and the judgment in W.P. No. 4406 (W) of 2010 with W.P. No. 5002 (W)

of 2010 should be read accordingly. They have no manner of

application in the facts scenario of the present case.



</p><p id="p_14">     Learned Advocate for the college has relied upon an unreported

decision of the Supreme Court dated December 6, 2012 rendered in

Civil Appeal No. 3070 of 2004 (Governing Body of P.A.E.M. College

&amp; Anr. v. State of Jharkhand &amp; Ors.) as well as another unreported

decision of a Division Bench of the Allahabad High Court dated

November 26, 2015 rendered in Special Appeal Defective No. 552 of

2015 (National Commission for Minority Edu. <a href="/doc/138364783/" id="a_8">Institutions v.

Abhinawa Sewa Sansthan Mahavidyalaya &amp; Ors</a>.). Referring to

such decisions, it has been submitted that, the Minority Commission

has original jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/45723846/" id="a_9">Section 11(f)</a> of the Act of 2004 to

declare an institution as a minority institution.
</p><p id="p_15">      Learned Advocate for the State had submitted that, the college is

not a minority institution. The Minority Commission did not have the

original jurisdiction to grant the declaration on October 13, 2008. Such

declaration is not valid in the eye of law. He has referred to the various

provisions of the Act of 2004 and has submitted that, with the coming

into force the Act of 2004 at the first instance a competent authority

under the Act of 2004 has the jurisdiction to grant a declaration. If the

application for declaration is rejected then an appeal lies to the Minority

Commission. While considering such appeal a Minority Commission

may grant the declaration as sought for. The Minority Commission

retains the jurisdiction to cancel such declaration under <a href="/doc/16099891/" id="a_10">Section 12C</a> of

the Act of 2004. According to him, the college authorities are not

entitled to any relief in W.P. No. 24847 (W) of 2015 or in the connected

application filed therewith.
</p>
<p id="p_16">

</p><p id="p_17">     Four issues have arisen for consideration for the present writ

petition. They are :- (i) whether Minority Commission has the original

jurisdiction   to   declare    an   institute   as   a   Minority   Educational

Institution? (ii) whether the declaration dated October 13, 2008 made

by the Minority Commission is valid? (iii) whether the minutes of the

meeting of the Governing Body dated February 3, 2013 relating to the
 suspension of the three teachers are valid? (iv) whether the State is in

error in withdrawing the approval granted to the Recruitment Rules?



</p><p id="p_18">     The college was established in 1992 by a registered society. An

application for approval of the proposal for establishment of the college

with minority status was submitted with the State Government. Such

application had remained undecided. The society and the organizing

committee of the college jointly had filed an application dated May 27,

2008 before the National Commission for Minority Educational

Institutions for declaration of minority status. By a writing dated

October 13, 2008 the National Commission had granted minority

declaration. The college had, thereafter, applied with the State

Government for grant of minority status on December 2, 2008. By a

writing dated January 12, 2009 the State Government had opined that

in view of the declaration by the Minority Commission no further

declaration of the same status was required.
</p>
<p id="p_19">

</p><p id="p_20">     The college in the meantime had been granted affiliation by the

Calcutta University. Subsequent to the declaration by the Minority

Commission, the college had framed rules relating to its management

and administration and had submitted the same for approval with the
 Calcutta University. In a syndicate meeting dated July 14, 2009

Calcutta   University    had   approved   such     Management       Rules.   A

Governing Body in terms of such Rules was constituted. Two of the

teachers before Court were members of the Governing Body. The

Governing Body had received complaints against three teachers. A fact

finding Committee was constituted by the Governing Body to look into

the allegations against the three teachers. Such fact finding Committee

had   submitted   a     recommendation    for    initiation   of   disciplinary

proceedings against the teachers. The Governing Body by a resolution

dated July 13, 2012 had resolved to initiate disciplinary proceedings

against the teachers.
</p>
<p id="p_21">

</p><p id="p_22">      The teachers have assailed the minority status of the college, and

consequently the validity of the governing body resolving to initiate

disciplinary proceedings. The result of the challenges by the teachers

would depend upon the interpretation of the various provisions of the

Act of 2004.

preamble of the Act of the 2004 says that a National Commission for

of 2004 and that it would be provide for matters connected therewith or

incidental thereto. Few sections of the Act of 2004 are relevant in the

at the level of the competent authority. The competent authority as

defined in <a href="/doc/109878755/" id="a_38">Section 2(ca)</a> of the Act of 2004 has been vested with the

jurisdiction to decide an application requesting grant of declaration of

an institution as a minority educational institution. The competent

authority is exercising original jurisdiction to decide such issue. A

person wishing to seek a declaration of minority educational institution

is required to apply to the competent authority as defined under <a href="/doc/109878755/" id="a_39">Section

2(ca)</a> of the Act of 2004 for the grant of no objection certificate for such

purpose. The competent authority thereafter may grant the declaration

</p><p id="p_64">      The provisions of the Act of 2004 have to be read harmoniously.

An interpretation of the various provisions of the Act of 2004 which

allows every provision to play its role assigned should be preferred over

that which renders a provision or a part of it as redundant. The appeal

under <a href="/doc/2069797/" id="a_44">Section 12A</a> is against an order refusing to grant no objection.

<a href="/doc/45723846/" id="a_45">Section 11(f)</a> of the Act of 2004 recognizes the right of an appellate

authority to have the same powers as that of the original authority in

deciding the lis. In such context the Commission has been empowered

under <a href="/doc/45723846/" id="a_46">Section 11(f)</a> to declare if it thinks appropriate that an institution

is a minority educational institution.

<a href="/doc/143777/" id="a_49">Section 10</a> thereof would do violence to the two tier system of

adjudication of an application for grant of approval. Accepting such an

interpretation would allow an applicant the forum of the competent

authority as well as the Minority Commission for the same purpose.

Such an interpretation would render the competent authority under

<a href="/doc/109878755/" id="a_50">Section 2(ca)</a> as well as the provisions of <a href="/doc/143777/" id="a_51">Section 10</a> including <a href="/doc/162679234/" id="a_52">Section

more particularly the deeming provisions of <a href="/doc/162679234/" id="a_53">Section 10(3)</a> would be

rendered useless. Appellate forum provided under <a href="/doc/2069797/" id="a_54">Section 12A</a> would

then stand converted to both an appellate forum and one with original

jurisdiction for the same purpose. A person aggrieved by a decision of

the Minority Commission purporting to exercise original jurisdiction for

such purpose would lose an appellate forum as the Act of 2004 does

not identify an appellate forum from an order passed by the Minority

<p id="p_67">

</p><p id="p_68">        Kiran Subbha &amp; Ors. (supra) is a Division Bench judgment of

this Hon'ble High Court. It has decided the question as to whether a

Commission under the Act of 2004 has original jurisdiction to declare

an institution as a minority educational institution or not. It has held

that,

             "47. Thus, from the aforesaid Rule it is clear that
        whether a particular institution is established or
        administered by the linguistic minority or not could be
        examined and decided by the State Government before the
        said Act of 2004 came into force, one has to apply to
        competent authority under <a href="/doc/143777/" id="a_56">section 10</a> of the said Act for
        obtaining no objection for establishing such institution. In our
        view, the Commission under Act of 2004 can act as an
        appellate authority, if such application is rejected."
       "44. It is contended that in <a href="/doc/143777/" id="a_57">section 10</a> read with <a href="/doc/938731/" id="a_58">section
11</a> of 2004 Act there is complete mechanism for granting
declaration of minority status. Such contention in our view is
not appropriate in this case. <a href="/doc/143777/" id="a_59">Section 10</a> enables any person
to apply to the competent authority for the grant of no
objection certificate to establish a minority educational
institution. This provision is applicable at the initial stage.
This competent authority, it appears to us, can grant no
objection certificate or refuse it but it has no power to declare
a particular existing institution as minority one. The
Commission is the appellate authority against the above
order refusing to grant no objection certificate. The functions
and powers of the Commission constituted under Act of 2004
have been provided in <a href="/doc/938731/" id="a_60">section 11</a> of the said Act. It appears
to us, that the Commission, in the matter of deciding question
of granting no objection certificate acts as an appellate
authority and this would be clear from <a href="/doc/2069797/" id="a_61">section 12A</a> and
<a href="/doc/103515909/" id="a_62">section 12B</a> of the 2004 Act, it is clear from <a href="/doc/103515909/" id="a_63">section 12B</a> of the
2004 Act that the Commission cannot pass any order for
declaration at the first instance. This initial function has to be
performed by the competent authority established by the
Central Government or any State Government. In the process
of doing so this authority has to reach fact finding about
minority. <a href="/doc/103515909/" id="a_64">Section 12B</a> of 2004 Act is set out hereunder for

Government, as the case may be, for grant of minority status

     Commission may, after giving the parties to the appeal, an
     opportunity of being heard, decide on the minority status of
     the educational institution and shall proceed to give such
     directions as it may deem fir an, such directions shall be
     binding on the parties.
</p><p id="p_75">           Explanation- For the purposes of this section and
     <a href="/doc/16099891/" id="a_66">section 12C</a>, 'authority' means any authority or officer or
     commission which is established under any law for the time
     being in force or under any order of the appropriate
     Government, for the purpose of granting a certificate of
     minority status to an educational institution."


     The decision in Kiran Subbha &amp; Ors. (supra) was rendered in

the context of writ petitioners there seeking a declaration that the

Nepali/Gorkha speaking people of hill areas in Darjeeling are linguistic

minorities and that they are entitled to the consequential declarations

in relation to educational institutions established and administered of

such linguistic minorities. In such context the provisions of the Act of

2004 along with provisions of other Acts were considered by their

Lordships. Their Lordships has held that, the contention that <a href="/doc/143777/" id="a_67">Section

10</a> read with <a href="/doc/45723846/" id="a_68">Section 11(f)</a> of the 2004 Act is a complete mechanism for

grant of declaration of minority status is not appropriate.



</p><p id="p_76">     Kiran Subbha &amp; Ors. (supra) has been considered in W.P. No.

4406 (W) of 2010 with W.P. No. 5002 (W) of 2010. The provisions of
 <a href="/doc/938731/" id="a_69">Section 11</a> as well as <a href="/doc/1831111/" id="a_70">Sections 12</a> and <a href="/doc/2069797/" id="a_71">12A</a> of the Act of 2004 have been

considered therein. It has been held that,

            "it can be pointed out that <a href="/doc/938731/" id="a_72">section 11</a> of the Act of 2004
     describes the functions of the Commission and <a href="/doc/1831111/" id="a_73">section 12</a>
     describes the powers of the Commission. Such 12, 12A, leave
     no manner of doubt that in the matter of granting minority
     status the National Commission has been given an appellate
     power. I am in any event bound by the Division Bench
     Judgment of this Court. When the commission is the
     appellate authority and the competent authority is the
     original authority under the Act and the admitted fact is that
     the task of the original authority was performed by the
     appellate authority, there is hardly any scope for any debate
     that the order was without jurisdiction. The fact that the
     State or the University unsuccessfully challenged the order
     before the commission is altogether besides the issue. Any
     order, which is passed without jurisdiction is illegal and a
     nullity and such illegality can be set up at any stage when
     the illegal order is sought to be relied upon."
</p>
<p id="p_77">
     In Sun Engineering Works (P) Ltd. (supra) it has been held that

it is neither desirable nor permissible to pick out a word or a sentence

from the judgment of the Supreme Court, divorced from the context of

the questions under consideration and treat it to be a complete 'law'

declared by the Supreme Court. The judgment must be read as a whole

and the observations from the judgment have to be considered in light

of the questions which were before the Supreme Court. A decision of the

Supreme Court takes its colour from the questions involved in the case

in which it was rendered. While applying the decision to a later case,

the Courts must carefully try to ascertain the true principles laid down
 by the decision of the Supreme Court and not to pick out words or

sentences from the judgment divorced from the context of the questions

under consideration by the Supreme Court, to support their reasonings.



</p><p id="p_78">     In ICICI Bank &amp; Anr. (supra) it has been held that, the ratio and

effect of the judgment is required to be ascertained with reference to the

question of law as decided by the Court. The ratio of the judgment or

the principle upon which the question before the Court has been

decided is alone binding as a precedent. The decision of the Supreme

Court upon a question of law is considered to be a binding precedent

and this must be ascertained and determined by analyzing all material

facts and issues involved in the case. In Girnar Traders (supra) it has

been held that, only the ratio decidendi can act as to binding or

authoritative precedent.
</p>
<p id="p_79">

</p><p id="p_80">     Applying such position in law, the decision rendered by the

Supreme Court in Governing Body of P.A.E.M. College (supra) has to

be considered. In such case the challenge in the writ petition was to the

order passed by the Government of Jharkhand holding that the college

was not a minority institution entitled to the protection of <a href="/doc/1687408/" id="a_74">Article 30(1)</a>

of the Constitution of India. At the time when such writ petition was
 filed, the Act of 2004 did not come into being. During the pendency of

the writ petition the Act of 2004 had come into effect. In the context of

an application for declaration of minority status being rejected by the

State government the Hon'ble Supreme Court had directed the

Commission established under the Act of 2004 to look into the issue.

Essentially the Supreme Court had directed the Commission to act as

an appellate authority since a decision by the State Government not to

grant minority status was under challenge in the writ petition. The

issue whether the Commission has original jurisdiction to declare

minority status was not in issue in such case nor was it decided.



</p><p id="p_81">     Governing Body of P.A.E.M. College (supra) has been considered

by the Division Bench of the Allahabad High Court in National

Commission for Minority Edu. Institutions (supra). With utmost

humility, I am unable to accept the ratio of National Commission for

Minority Edu. Institutions (supra).
</p>
<p id="p_82">

</p><p id="p_83">     In Pradip J. Mehta (supra) the Supreme Court has held that, a

High Court is within its rights to differ from a view taken by the other

High Courts. It should however record its reasons for such purpose.
</p><p id="p_84">      The ratio of Governing Body of P.A.E.M College (supra) has not

been correctly applied in National Commission for Minority Edu.

Institutions (supra). The reasoning of vesting the Minority Commission

with original jurisdiction to declare minority status is not acceptable to

me as it would allow two forai to have original jurisdiction under the Act

of 2004 for the same purpose. Minority Commission would then be both

an appellate forum as well as have original jurisdiction for the same

purpose. Clothing the Minority Commission with original jurisdiction

would affect the right of appeal. <a href="/doc/1361927/" id="a_75">The Act</a> of 2004 has not provided for an

appellate forum the decision of the Minority Commission. <a href="/doc/1361927/" id="a_76">The Act</a> of

2004, however, provides for an appeal to the Minority Commission

against a decision relating to the status of an educational institution.

Moreover, Kiran Subbha &amp; Ors. (supra) is a binding precedent on me.



</p><p id="p_85">     In such circumstances, the first issue is answered by holding that

the Minority Commission does not have the original jurisdiction to

declare minority status of an educational institution.



</p><p id="p_86">     In view of the answer to the first issue, the second issue has to be

answered in favour of the teachers and against the college. The
 declaration dated October 13, 2008 of the Minority Commission is not

valid.
</p>
<p id="p_87">

</p><p id="p_88">      The teachers were suspended and sought to be proceed against by

a resolution of Governing Body dated February 3, 2013. On such date

the   Governing   Body   taking   the   resolution   was   admittedly   not

constituted in accordance with the provisions of the First Statutes of

the Calcutta University. The composition of the Governing Body has

been claimed to be in accordance with the constitution of the college.

The Calcutta University to which the college is affiliated had proceeded

on the basis of the declaration of minority status granted by the

Minority Commission in approving the independent Rules for the

management and administration of the college. The basis of such grant

of approval is bad in law. Therefore, the approval cannot be said to be

valid. The participation of two teachers in such a Governing Body does

not clothe the Governing Body with any legality which it did not have at

the first place. The teachers have a right to have their fate decided by a

duly constituted Governing Body. The Governing Body deciding to

proceed against the teachers cannot be said to be duly constituted. The

declaration of the minority status is bad. The composition of the

Governing Body is consequently vitiated. The Governing Body on
 February 3, 2013 not being constituted in accordance with the First

Statutes of Calcutta University has no jurisdiction to take the

resolution as recorded on February 3, 2013 or to proceed against the

teachers.
</p>
<p id="p_89">

</p><p id="p_90">     In such circumstances, the third issue is answered in favour of the

teachers and against the college. The resolution dated February 3, 2013

of the Governing Body suspending the teachers and resolving to initiate

disciplinary proceedings against the teachers are set aside. All

consequential steps taken by any authority in terms of the resolution

dated February 3, 2013 of the Governing Body are set aside. The college

will allow the teachers to rejoin immediately. All monetary and service

benefits accruing the teachers during the period of their suspension

should be paid and restored to them as expeditiously as possible. The

teachers will be treated to be in service as if the order of suspension

had not been passed.

<p id="p_91">

</p><p id="p_92">     W.P. No. 12033 (W) of 2013, W.P. No. 12040 (W) of 2013 and W.P.

No. 12036 (W) of 2013 are allowed. No order as to costs.
</p><p id="p_93">      In W.P. No. 24847 (W) of 2015 the college authorities have

impugned a writing dated January 20, 2015 issued by the Higher

Education Department of the State. By such writing the recruitment

rules for appointment of teachers, librarians for the college as approved

by the writing dated December 13, 2014 was cancelled and withdrawn.

</p><p id="p_94">     State authorities had granted approval to the recruitment rules for

the college on the premise that the college had been declared as a

minority educational institution. The State thereafter realizing its

mistake had withdrawn such approval by the writing dated January 20,

2015. The college was never declared as a minority educational

institution validly. Consequently, the State Government was in error in

granting approval to the recruitment rules for the college on the

premise that the college was a minority educational institution. This

mistake has been rightly corrected by the impugned writing dated

January 20, 2015. Consequently, college authorities are not entitled to

any relief in its writ petition. The fourth issue is answered in the

negative, against the college and in favour of the State.



</p><p id="p_95">     W.P. No. 24847 (W) of 2015 is, therefore, dismissed. In view of the

dismissal of the writ petition, CAN 1406 of 2016 is also dismissed.
</p><p id="p_96">      It is clarified that this order will prevent the college or the society

or any other person from applying for grant of minority status in

accordance with the Act of 2004. In the event of such an application

being made or in the event the competent authority under the Act of

2004 is persuaded to consider a pending application, if any, the

competent authority will decide such application is accordance with law

being uninfluenced by any of the observations made therein.



</p><p id="p_97">     Urgent photostat certified copy of this order, if applied for, be given

to the parties on priority basis.

<p id="p_100">     The learned Advocate for the college authorities prays for stay of

the judgment and order. He submits that, by reason of this judgment
