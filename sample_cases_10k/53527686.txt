JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">1.        By this judgment, I shall dispose of an appeal filed by
the appellant against the order dated 02.07.2019 (in short
impugned order) passed by Ms.Niharika Kumar Sharma, Ld.MM­

                                                           CA No.149/<a href="/doc/63587126/" id="a_1">2019
                                                     Rajan Kumar vs. State</a>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                                            Page No.1 of 5</span>
 04 (North), Rohini Courts, New Delhi (in short Ld. M.M.) in
challan   No.0564438/19,    Circle­Karol   Bagh   by    which         the
appellant has been sentenced to undergo simple imprisonment
for a period of 07 days and to pay a total fine of Rs.5,100/­
under <a href="/doc/139481594/" id="a_2">Section 185</a> of the Motor Vehicles Act, as the appellant
was driving the vehicle under the influence of alcohol in a public
place. Ld.Counsel for the appellant has submitted that fine, as
imposed by Ld.MM has already been deposited. Receipt thereof
is available on record.
</p>

<p id="p_2">2.         I have heard Ld.counsel for appellant and Ld.Addl.PP
for the State and also gone through the record and relevant
provisions of law.
</p>

<p id="p_3">3.         Aggrieved by the judgment of Ld.M.M, the appellant
has preferred the appeal only to the extent of sentence awarded
to him. The appellant was driving a two wheeler vehicle under
influence of liquor at the time of his challan.    Ld.counsel for
appellant has submitted that the appellant had pleaded guilty
under the impression that only fine would be imposed and he
would be discharged, as it was not explained to him that
sentence for imprisonment might be passed against him.                 He
has submitted that the appellant has been falsely implicated by
police without medical examination by showing the quantity of
liquor 267.9 mg/100 ml, although he is not challenging the
conviction as such.
</p>


<p id="p_4">                                                             CA No.149/<a href="/doc/63587126/" id="a_3">2019

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                                              Page No.2 of 5</span>
</p><p id="p_5"> 4.         He has urged that the appellant is first offender, who
is the sole bread earner of his family and has liability of his
entire family consisting of his old age parents, brother and
younger sister and the sentence will have adverse impact on his
family reputation. It is urged that a lenient view may be taken
against him and sentence awarded to him to undergo simple
imprisonment for a period of 07 days for the offence punishable
under <a href="/doc/1321824/" id="a_4">Sections 129</a>/<a href="/doc/103867614/" id="a_5">177</a>, <a href="/doc/935822/" id="a_6">3</a>/<a href="/doc/31261615/" id="a_7">181</a>, <a href="/doc/1631786/" id="a_8">115</a>/<a href="/doc/32624072/" id="a_9">190</a>, <a href="/doc/42762185/" id="a_10">146</a>/<a href="/doc/125316407/" id="a_11">196</a> and <a href="/doc/139481594/" id="a_12">185</a> of
M.V.Act be set aside. He has submitted that the appellant is the
sole bread earner of his family and is a first offender and some
monetary penalty may be imposed by the court in place of
simple imprisonment for a period of 07 days and that the
appellant is remorseful and will never repeat his conduct.
</p>

<p id="p_6">5.         Ld.Addl.PP for State, on the other hand, has strongly
opposed the appeal. He has submitted that the appellant was
driving a two wheeler under the influence of liquor at the time of
challan and conduct of accused is highly negligent, dangerous
and alarming for the safety of others. It was a threat not just to
himself but to society at large and argued that drunken driving
should be seriously viewed and on being tested through alcohol
analysis instrument, the blood of the appellant had shown the
quantity of alcohol as 267.9 mg/100 ml as against the
permissible limit of 30 mg/100 ml under <a href="/doc/139481594/" id="a_13">Section 185</a> of M.V.Act,
so, the impugned order passed by Ld.M.M (North) should be
confirmed and appeal should be dismissed.
</p>


<p id="p_7">                                                           CA No.149/<a href="/doc/63587126/" id="a_14">2019
                                                     Rajan Kumar vs. State</a>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                                            Page No.3 of 5</span>
</p><p id="p_8"> 6.         The appeal against conviction on the plea of guilt of
appellant has a limited scope. Such an appeal attracts <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_15">Section
375</a> Cr.P.C and the appellant/convict can challenge the extent
or legality of the sentence only.
</p>

<p id="p_9">7.         The conviction of present appellant is on the plea of
guilt. The sentence of fine imposed under provisions of <a href="/doc/785258/" id="a_16">Motor
Vehicle Act</a> is also reasonable and within the parameters given
under the Act. Therefore, I do not find any justification to
interfere with the discretion of Ld.MM imposing the fine on plea
of guilt of accused under <a href="/doc/139481594/" id="a_17">section 185</a> of Motor Vehicle Act.
Therefore, there is no merit in the appeal, in so far as the
sentence of fine imposed by Ld.M.M upon the appellant.             The
sentence to undergo simple imprisonment for a period of 07 days
for the offence punishable under <a href="/doc/1321824/" id="a_18">Sections 129</a>/<a href="/doc/103867614/" id="a_19">177</a>, <a href="/doc/935822/" id="a_20">3</a>/<a href="/doc/31261615/" id="a_21">181</a>,
<a href="/doc/1631786/" id="a_22">115</a>/<a href="/doc/32624072/" id="a_23">190</a>, <a href="/doc/42762185/" id="a_24">146</a>/<a href="/doc/125316407/" id="a_25">196</a> and <a href="/doc/139481594/" id="a_26">185</a> of M.V.Act, being severe type of
sentence which affects the appellant to earn his livelihood, can,
in my view, be substituted by a lighter sentence, particularly
looking to the fact that he is a first offender and he has done
social service by planting five trees as undertaken by him before
the court on 01.08.2019 which is evident from the photographs
of planting trees supported by his affidavit. Therefore, modifying
the sentence awarded by the Ld.MM, appellant is sentenced to
undergo imprisonment till rising of the court (TRC) and further
payment of amount of Rs.5,000/­ towards fine.
</p>

<p id="p_10">8.         With these modifications in sentence and confirming

                                                           CA No.149/2019

 the conviction of appellant under Sections 129/177, 3/181,
115/190, 146/196 and 185 of the Motor Vehicles Act, the
appeal is disposed of.
