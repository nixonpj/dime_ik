 IN THE HIGH COURT OF JUDICATURE FOR RAJASTHAN
AT JAIPUR BENCH

ORDER

Jagdish Narayan Sharma              Vs.      State of Rajasthan &amp; Another    
(S.B. Civil Writ Petition No.10202/2015)

Date of Order: 			     		   August 20, 2015.

PRESENT
HON'BLE  MR. JUSTICE ALOK SHARMA

Mr. Vinod Goyal, for the petitioner.
Mr. Rajendra Prasad, AAG for respondents.

BY THE COURT:</pre>

<p id="p_1">	The petitioner is aggrieved of the charge-sheet dated 29-4-2015, issued a day prior to his retirement dated 30-4-2015 and seeks intervention of this court for quashing the same on the ground of delay of about 20 years as the charges pertain to the years 1988-1996.
</p><p id="p_2">	Heard counsel for the petitioner. Perused the writ petition.
</p><p id="p_3">	The petitioner a Class-IV employee in the office of District Collector Ajmer was prosecuted following charge-sheet filed after investigation in FIR No.157/1999, Police Station Clock Tower, Ajmer for the offences under <a href="/doc/1436241/" id="a_1">Sections 420</a>, <a href="/doc/1985627/" id="a_2">467</a>, <a href="/doc/556166/" id="a_3">468</a>, <a href="/doc/1466184/" id="a_4">471</a> and <a href="/doc/1897847/" id="a_5">120B</a> IPC. He was suspended in 1999 for reason of his criminal prosecution. However he was reinstated on 9-8-2011 subject to the outcome of criminal proceedings. The trial court vide judgment dated 7-8-2014 acquitted the petitioner apparently for the offences alleged against the petitioner not being proved beyond reasonable doubt for which the petitioner was charged.
</p>
<p id="p_4">	The petitioner was thereafter superannuated on 30-4-2015. However, one day prior therto on 29-4-2015 the petitioner was served with a charge-sheet in respect of four charges for the period of 1988-1996, where the prime charge, (along with other minor charges) was the alleged misconduct of issuing forged ration-card in favour of Gurnam Singh in conspiracy with others, in complete contravention of the Rules for the issue of ration cards.
</p>
<p id="p_5">	Counsel for the petitioner has submitted that the charge-sheet after an inordinate delay of about 20 years after the alleged acts of misconduct, is wholly arbitrary and exfacie prejudicial to the petitioner. It may threfore be quashed as allowing a departmental enquiry after the petitioner has been acquitted of offences alleged on the same facts entails only harassment of the petitioner.
</p><p id="p_6">	Heard. Considered. I am of the view that in the facts of the case the charge-sheet dated 29-4-2015 cannot be interfered with or quashed on the ground of inordinate delay. As the petitioner was admittedly being prosecuted in respect of offences resulting from issuing forged ration-card in criminal case, the department held back the departmental enquiry on same facts, and only on petitioner's acquittal vide judgment dated 7-8-2014, has on consideration of the matter decided to initiate a departmental enquiry. The charges against the petitioner are not minor in nature, but serious, and mere acquittal of the petitioner in a criminal case on ground of benefit of doubt cannot absolve the petitioner as an employee of the department to answer the charges in a departmental enquiry, which unlike a criminal case is held and conducted on preponderance of probability with reference to the evidence/ facts on record. The charges pertain to contravention of rules by the petitioner in issuing ration-cards also by resorting to forgery. The charge-sheet dated 29-4-2015 can neither be held to be without jurisdiction or vitiated by malafide. The delay stands explained. I am, therefore, not inclined to interfere with the charge sheet in the exercise of this court's jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_6">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India. 
</p>
<p id="p_7">	However, as the petitioner superannuated on 30-4-2015, I would direct that the departmental enquiry against him be completed within a period of twelve months, from the date of presentation of a certified copy of this order. The petitioner is directed to cooperate in the departmental enquiry, file his reply/ defence to the charge-sheet within seven days from today bringing the order of this court to the notice of the Enquiry Officer. Counsel for the petitioner on his behalf undertakes that the petitioner will not seek adjournment in the departmental enquiry. In the event of, despite the petitioner cooperating in departmental enquiry, as directed hereinabove, the departmental enquiry is yet not completed within the aforesaid period of 12 months, for any reason not attributable to the petitioner, aside of force majeure, and final orders are not passed, it is directed a la the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of State of Punjab Vs. Chaman Lal Goyal [(1995)2 SCC 570] that the departmental enquiry shall then be deemed to have been dropped. However, it is made clear that if the petitioner does not cooperate as directed hereinabove, in the conclusion of the departmental enquiry within the aforesaid period of twelve months, the departmental enquiry shall continue and will not lapse.
</p><p id="p_8">	The writ petition stands disposed of accordingly.
