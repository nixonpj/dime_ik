Scheme to start PCO &amp; Photostat business.  The request was accepted and a 

personal loan of Rs.75,000/­ was sanctioned, lent, released and availed by 

defendant   06.10.2005   as   per   terms   and   conditions   contained   in   the 

Arrangement   Letter   and   documents   executed   by   the   defendant.     The 

defendant executed and delivered a Composite Term Loan Agreement.  The 

composite   term   loan   was   agreed   to   be   repaid   in   60   equated   monthly 

installments of Rs.1,500/­ each along­with interest @ 0.75% below SBAR

</p><p id="p_6">5.               The defendant hypothecated entire stocks of the shop including 

raw material and photostat machines etc. as security for proper repayment &amp; 

adherence to the financial discipline.  The contents of Composite Term Loan 

Agreement were duly filled, read over and explained to the defendant at the 

the of obtaining his signatures voluntarily.  However, the defendant failed to 

maintain the financial discipline and did not pay the installments regularly. 

On   persistent   defaults,   the   plaintiff   bank   served   a   legal   notice   dated 

20.09.2008 but the defendant paid no heed to it.   Hence, the plaintiff bank

80,700/­ is due and payable by the defendant to the plaintiff bank.  

</p><p id="p_9">7.               The   cause   of   action   accrued   in   favour   of   plaintiff   bank   when 

defendant executed Composite Loan Agreement and availed the loan facility 

on   0610.2005.   It   again   arose   when   a   legal   notice   of   demand   dated 

20.09.2008 was served upon defendant.

</p>
<p id="p_12">10.              The   cause   of   action   accrued   in   favour   of   plaintiff   bank   when 

defendant executed Composite Loan Agreement and availed the loan facility 

on   0610.2005.   It   again   arose   when   a   legal   notice   of   demand   dated 

20.09.2008 was served upon defendant.  The present suit has been filed on 

01.10.2008.  The suit is, therefore, within limitation period.  The entire loan

transaction was entered into between the parties at Delhi.   The Composite 

Term Loan Agreement was filled, signed &amp; executed at Delhi.   The loan 

facility   was   also   availed   at   Delhi,   thus,   this   Court   has   the   territorial 

jurisdiction to entertain &amp; try the present suit. 
</p>
<p id="p_13">11.              Since, the defendant has failed to defend his case and to lead any 

evidence in support of his case, the testimony of PW­1 goes unrebutted and 

unchallenged.     In   the   facts   and   circumstances   of   the   case,   the   Court   is 

convinced that defendant did not make any payment of the outstanding loan 

amount.   Hence, the Court is convinced that the plaintiff has successfully 

proved her case.
</p>
<p id="p_14">12.              In   the   light   of   above   discussion,   the   suit   has   been   decreed   in 

favour of plaintiff bank and against the defendant for a sum of Rs.80,700/­ 

( Rupees Eighty Thousand &amp; Seven Hundred Only ).   The plaintiff bank has 

claimed interest @ 12.75% per annum with monthly interest till payment 

and/or realization.   However, the Court is not inclined to grant interest @ 
 State Bank of India                         8                      Shri Mahender Arora


12.75% per annum.   Pendentelite &amp; future interest @ 12% per annum is, 

therefore, granted in favour of plaintiff bank and against the defendant.  The 

cost of the suit is also awarded in favour of plaintiff bank.  The suit is thus, 

decreed.
