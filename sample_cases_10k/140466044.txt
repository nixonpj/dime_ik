           HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE AJAY RASTOGI
         HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE ASHOK KUMAR GAUR

                              Order
01/09/2017

     The appellant was not party to the proceedings before the

Ld. Single Judge and has filed application seeking leave of the

Court in assailing the order dt.14-9-2016.

</p><p id="p_4">     The writ petitioner approached this Court by filing of writ

petition that despite his final selection on the post of Constable

after going through the selection process initiated by the

authorities in terms of the advertisement dt.14-7-2013, his

appointment has been withheld by the respondent without any

reasonable justification.
</p>
<p id="p_5">     Reply was filed by the State Government and after the

matter being heard the Ld. Single Judge was of the view that

withholding his appointment after his name finds place in the
                                (2 of 3)
                                                        [SAW-1112/2017]

select list &amp; noting adverse came on record which in any manner

could dis-entitle him from being considered for appointment

directed the State authorities to consider candidature of the writ

petitioner for appointment on the post of Constable under its order

impugned dt.14-9-2016.
</p>
<p id="p_6">     The applicant before us is not the person/applicant who had

participated in the selection process held by the respondent for

the post of Constable in which the writ petitioner had participated

in terms of the advertisement dt.14-7-2013 but his grievance is

that he was complainant at whose instance FIR at one stage was

registered against the writ petitioner and he has made material

concealment while submitting online application &amp; participated in

the selection process held by the respondents in reference to

advertisement dt.14-7-2013.
</p>
<p id="p_7">     What is being contended before us even if taken at its face

value the present applicant has no locus standi to question the

selection of the writ petitioner which has been examined by the

Ld. Single Judge under its order impugned and merely being a

complainant or victim at whose instance FIR was registered,

further action is always to be taken by the State authorities

through its agencies and its consequence is always open to be

considered while adjudging overall suitability of the applicant for

appointment under the relevant rules but we are clear in our mind

that the present applicant has no locus to question the selection of

the writ petitioner who has been finally found suitable for

appointment &amp; that has been examined by the Ld. Single Judge

under its order impugned dt.14-9-2016.
</p><p id="p_8">                               (3 of 3)
                                                       [SAW-1112/2017]

     We are not inclined to grant indulgence to the applicant in

assailing order of the Ld. Single Judge impugned dt.14-9-2016.

However, we make it clear that we have not examined the matter

in detail/merits since the present applicant has no locus to

question in the given facts &amp; circumstances to assail order of the

Ld. Single Judge impugned dt.14-9-2016.

</p><p id="p_9">     Consequently, application seeking leave of the Court stands

rejected, as a consequence the appeal is also dismissed.
