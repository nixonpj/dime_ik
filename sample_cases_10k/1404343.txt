XIII  Metropolitan  Magistrate,  Egmore,  Chennai, in CC.No.8495 of 1998 dated
20.9.2000.

!For Appellant :  Mr.  C.N.Niranjan

^For Respondents :  Mr.  K.Moorthy

:J U D G M E N T
</pre>
<p id="p_1">                This is an appeal  against  the  order  of  acquittal  for  an
offence under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_1">Section 138</a> of the Negotiable Instruments Act.
</p>
<p id="p_2">                2.   The  impugned  order reveals that the complainant was not
present on a number of days; petitions under <a href="/doc/466785/" id="a_2">Section 256</a> CrPC were filed,  and
the case  was adjourned.  Even thereafter, for four consecutive hearings, i.e.
on 2.8.2000, 16.8.2000, 6.9.2000 and 20.9.2000, neither  the  complainant  nor
his counsel  was present.  The matter was adjourned to 2.8.2000 for arguments;
on 2.8.2000 as well as on  the  subsequent  dates  of  hearing  on  16.8.2000,
6.9.2000 also  there  was no representation for the complainant.  Finally, the
matter was adjourned  to  20.9.2000.    Even,  on  that  date,  there  was  no
representation for the appellant herein.  Therefore, the accused was acquitted
exercising power under <a href="/doc/1988204/" id="a_3">Section 256(1)</a> CrPC.
</p>
<p id="p_3">                3.   Aggrieved  against the said order, the present appeal has
been filed.
</p>





<p id="p_4">                4.   The  learned  counsel   for   the   appellant/complainant
submitted that there was nothing for the appellant to present on the aforesaid
dates since  he has already adduced evidence.  More over, since it is a summon
case, order should have  been  passed  based  on  the  evidence  available  on
records, and the matter need not have to be posted for arguments.
</p>
<p id="p_5">                5.   The learned counsel for the respondents/accused submitted
that though the order of acquittal may not be legal for the absence on  single
day  by  the  appellant,  the  appellant  herein  was  absent continuously and
therefore the order passed by the lower Court cannot be set aside.  In support
of his contention, the learned counsel referred to the judgment of the  Bombay
High Court in M/s.  HOTEL BANDRA INTERNATIONAL (P) LTD.  v..  BRIJ MEHRA [2004
CRI.L.J.143].  In that appeal the Bombay High Court dismissed the case stating
that the  ratio  of  the  judgment  of  the  Supreme Court in Mohd.  Azeem v..
Venkatesh, (2002) 8 SCALE 331 (SC) :  2003 Bom Cr (Cri)  146  case  would  not
applicable to the facts of that case.  The argument of the learned counsel for
the  respondents  that  the  ratio  laid  down  by  the Supreme Court in Mohd.
Azeem'S case  is  not  applicable  to  the  facts  of  the  present  case,  is
acceptable.
</p>
<p id="p_6">                6.   But,  at  the  same  time,  the  arguments of the learned
counsel for the appellant that the appellant had nothing to  do  on  the  said
dates  since he has closed his evidence, and that since this is a summon case,
the Court should have passed orders on the basis of the evidence available  on
records  and  that  there  was  no  need  for  posting  it  for arguments, are
acceptable.  As per S.314 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_4">CrPC</a>, any party to a  proceeding  may  address  oral
arguments.   If  the party does not address arguments, a Magistrate or a Judge
shall pass judgment based on the evidence.  Since the appellant has closed his
evidence and the respondents did not want to examine any  witness,  the  lower
Court,  instead  of  dismissing  the case for non-appearance of the appellant,
should have passed orders on the basis of the evidence available  on  records.
Therefore, the order of the lower Court dismissing the complaint on the ground
of  non-appearance  and acquitting the respondents is not legally sustainable.
Hence the same is liable to be set aside and it is set aside.
</p>
<p id="p_7">                7.  In the result, the criminal  appeal  is  allowed  and  the
matter  is remitted back to the trial Court for passing orders on the basis of
the evidence available on records, within two  months.    The  petitioner  and
respondents  shall  be  given  opportunity  to putforth their case, if they so
desire, by filing an application for that, before passing orders.
