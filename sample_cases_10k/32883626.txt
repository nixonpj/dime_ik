     did not make the payment within stipulated period, hence present

     complaint was filed under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_3">section 138</a> of Negotiable Instruments

     Act,1881 <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_4">(The Act</a>).

</p><p id="p_10">5. Accused made an application under <a href="/doc/109927775/" id="a_6">section 145(2)</a>. Application was

  allowed and accused was given opportunity to cross examine the

  complainant.
</p>
<p id="p_11">6. Complainant adopted his pre summoning evidence. He conceded in

  his cross examination that he knew accused from 7-8 years. Loan

  was advanced by way of cash. No documents for same were

  prepared. He has not shown the loan in Income tax return. He has

  not received any payment from accused. He has given loan out of

  his personal savings and from borrowing from his father. He has

  annual income of Rs. 4 lac.he knows Bhim Singh and he is friends

  with him for past 15 years.
</p>
<p id="p_12">7. Complainant evidence was closed and the accused was examined

  under <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_7">section 313</a> read with <a href="/doc/224316/" id="a_8">section 281</a> Cr.Pc. All the incriminating

  evidence were put to him in vernacular and accused stated that he

  has been falsely implicated in the present case. The cheque in

  question bears his signature however he has not filled the details on

  cheque. Cheque was never issued to the complainant. It was issued

  to Bhim Singh Dhania as security for loan of Rs. 1.5 lac. Bhim Singh

  did not return the cheque on re payment of loan. He lead Defence

  evidence.
</p>
<p id="p_13">8. DW 1 Umang Dhingra has stated that accused made that accused

  made the payment to Bhim in front of him and Bhim did not return

  the cheque as he did not have it at that moment. Later he came to

</p>
<p id="p_15">10.     The aforestated cheque was presented by the complainant for

  encashment to his bank Bank of Baroda, S P Badli, Delhi. The

  cheque was returned back dishonored vide return memo dated

  24.04.2014 with reason "Funds Insufficient". Complainant thereafter

  gave legal demand notice to the accused on 07.05.2014 calling

  upon him to make payment within 15 days from notice. The said

  notice was sent by the Speed Post. Despite the service the accused

  did not make the payment within stipulated period.Accused is

  making false story to save him from liability. Accused has taken

  contradictory stands in court.
</p>
<p id="p_16">11.     Per contra it is argued by the counsel for the accused that

  complainant has not filed on record any documentary proof of loan

  transaction. Source of money is not cogently proved by the

  complainant. Cheque was given to Bhim Singh and same is misused

  by the complainant. Reliance is placed on <a href="/doc/53206885/" id="a_9">Vijay v. Laxman</a> 2013 II

  SLT 140.
</p><p id="p_17"> 12.      I have heard the complainant and accused and have perused

   the record. Both the parties did not wish to file written arguments.
</p><p id="p_18">13.      At the outset it is wise to discuss the legal principles involved

   in present matter at hand. Present complaint is filed u/s 138 of the

   Act. The object of the legislation is to encourage the culture of use

   of cheques and enhance the credibility of the instrument.

</p><p id="p_19">14.      The legal regime pertaining to the offence under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_10">section 138</a>

   of the act has numerous components inter alia,

</p><p id="p_20">      a) Cheque was drawn by a person on an account maintained by
         him

</p><p id="p_21">      b) It was drawn for the discharge, in whole or in part, of any debt
         or other liability

</p><p id="p_22">      c) Cheque was presented to the bank within a period of six
         month from the date it was drawn or within the period of its
         validity.
</p>
<p id="p_23">      d) Cheque was returned by the bank unpaid due to insufficient
         funds or that it exceeds the amount arranged to be paid.

</p><p id="p_24">      e) Payee or holder in due course make demand of payment of
         the said amount of money by giving a notice, in writing within
         30 days of receipt of information by him from the bank
         regarding the return of cheque as unpaid.
</p>
<p id="p_25">      f) The drawer of the cheque fails to make payment of the said
         amount of money within 15 days of the receipt of the said
         notice

</p><p id="p_26">      g) Complaint was filed in writing within one month of the date on
         which cause of action arised
</p><p id="p_27"> 15.       Statutory   and   legal   presumptions   in   favor   of   payee/

  complainant as laid down by the Act and precedents can be

  summarized as follows.
</p>
<p id="p_28">        a) Presumption as to liability: it shall be presumed unless
          contrary is proved that the holder of cheque received the
          same in discharge of any debt or liability (sec 139 and 118(a))

</p><p id="p_29">        b) Presumption of dishonor: court shall presume dishonor of
          cheque on production of bank's slip or memo having official
          mark denoting that cheque has been dishonored unless such
          fact is disproved.(sec 146)

</p><p id="p_30">        c) Service of legal demand notice: notice sent at correct address
          by making complete payments of postal expenses in advance
          deem to be served and drawer has to show during trial after
          leading evidence that same was not served .(see <a href="/doc/272690/" id="a_11">C.C. Alavi
          Haji v. Palapetty Muhammed</a> 2007 Crl.l.J 3214)

</p><p id="p_31">16.       Now I shall discuss components of offence in light of facts and

  circumstances of present case

</p><p id="p_32">17.       Issuance of cheque

      Issuance of cheque is not disputed by the accused. However, it is

  submitted that cheque was issued in blank. <a href="/doc/232831/" id="a_12">Section 20</a> NI Act talks

  about such instruments. As per this provision, if a person gives duly

  signed but blank or partly written cheque then he deem to have

  given implied authority to the holder to fill up the particulars in it

  and complete it and thus make him liable for the payment

  mentioned in it. Accused has argued that cheque was issued Bhim

  Singh.
</p><p id="p_33"> 18.     Cheque was present to bank for payment and it was

  returned back unpaid.
</p>
<p id="p_34">  Dishonor of cheque is also not disputed. Complainant has proved on

  record return memo dated 24.04.2014 Ex.Cw1/2
</p><p id="p_35">19.     Legal demand notice within 30 days of return of

  cheque and no payment by drawer within 15 days of receipt.

  In present case legal demand notice Ex. CW1/3 was sent on

  7.05.2014   by Speed Post and courierto the accused. Receipt of

  legal demand notice is not denied by the accused .

</p><p id="p_36">20.     Legally enforceable debt or liability

  It is a well settled position of law that when a negotiable instrument

  is drawn, two statutory presumptions arise in favor of the complaint,

  one under <a href="/doc/268919/" id="a_13">Section 139</a> NI Act and another under <a href="/doc/1177058/" id="a_14">Section 118(a)</a> of

  the NI Act. Further, the court will presume a negotiable instrument

  for consideration unless and until after considering the matter

  before it, it either believes that the consideration does not exist or

  consider the non-existence of the consideration so probable that a

  prudent man ought under the circumstances of the particular case

  to act upon the supposition that the consideration does not exist.

  For rebutting such presumption, what is needed is to raise a

  probable defense. Reliance is placed on <a href="/doc/533881/" id="a_15">M.S. Narayana Menon v.

  State of Kerala</a>, (2006) 6 SCC 39.
</p>
<p id="p_37">21.     In present case it is the defence of accused is that cheque

  was given to Bhim Singh as security and he did not return the same,

  however accused has not examined Bhim Singh as witness to prove

  this fact. Moreover, onus was on accused to prove the defense
      cogently. He has failed to examine Bhim Singh. In this case DW 1

     has stated that accused asked for the cheque from Bhim Singh,

     however he has no where stated that cheque was given in his

     presence or whether cheque in question was the same cheque as

     demanded by the accused from Bhim Singh.
</p>
<p id="p_38">  22.     Stand of the accused that he asked for return of cheque from

     Bhim Singh is not supported by any complaint or notice for return of

     said cheque, neither payment of the cheque was ever stopped by

     the accused. Moreover, accused has given suggestion to the

     complainant in cross examination that loan of Rs. 1,5 lac was taken

     from him and cheque was asked for in return from complainant.

</p><p id="p_39">  23.     In light of above discussion, accused has failed to rebut the

     presumptions raised in favor of complainant. Accordingly, He is

     convicted for offence under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_16">section 138</a> NI Act.
