                            With the consent of the parties, finally heard.
                            At the outset, learned counsel for the petitioners placed reliance on
                     the order passed by Indore Bench of this Court in W.P. No.5318/<a href="/doc/136216408/" id="a_1">2018
                     [Balwan Areda and others vs. State of Madhya Pradesh and others</a>].
                     It is pointed out that on the last date of submission of candidature i.e.,
                     13.03.2017 the petitioners were having the qualification but the
                     certificate was belatedly issued on 09.03.2017. Similar point is
                     considered by the Indore Bench and the petition is allowed. Present
                     petitioners are entitled to get the similar benefit.
</p><p id="p_3">                            Prayer is opposed by Mr. Dubey, learned GA. He submits that on
                     the last date of submission of the candidature, petitioners did not have the
                     requisite diploma.
</p><p id="p_4">                            I have heard the parties at length on this aspect.
                            The Indore Bench in the case of Balwan Areda (supra) opined as
                     under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">                                  "At t he time, t he petitioners submitted their online applications, they
                           were having the qualification required for the posts in question and the mark-
                           sheets were also submitted by them and, therefore, in the considered opinion
                           of this Court, the action of the respondents in cancelling the candidatures of
                           the petitioners is contrary to the statutory provisions governing the field.</blockquote>
<p id="p_5">                                  Resultantly, the writ petition stands allowed. The impugned order passed
                           by the respondents dated 26.02.2018 (Annexure P-1) is hereby quashed. The
                           respondents are directed to issue fresh merit-cum-selection list. Petitioners, in
                           case, are placed in the merit list, consequential appointment orders be issued in
                           the matter. This Court on 09.03.2018 while issuing notices to the respondents
                           has observed that any appointment made in the matter shall be subject to final
                           outcome of the writ petition and, therefore, if any appointment has been made
                           by the respondents, the respondents shall be free to cancel the appointment
