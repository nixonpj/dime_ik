THE JUDGMENT AND AWARD DATED:09.03.2009 PASSED
IN MVC NO.1998/2004 ON THE FILE OF THE XII ADDL.
SMALL CAUSES, JUDGE &amp; MEMBER, MACT, BANGALORE,
PARTLY   ALLOWING   THE   CLAIM    PETITION  FOR
COMPENSATION AND SEEKING ENHANCEMENT OF
COMPENSATION.

     This appeal coming on for Hearing, this day, the
Court, delivered the following:

                     JUDGMENT
</pre>

<p id="p_1">     This   appeal   is   by   the   claimant   seeking

enhancement of compensation awarded by the Tribunal.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                             3</span>

</p><p id="p_2">2.    For the sake of convenience parties are referred to

as they are referred to in the claim petition before the

Tribunal.
</p>
<p id="p_3">

</p><p id="p_4">3.    As there is no dispute regarding injuries sustained

by the claimant in a road traffic accident occurred on

19-02-2004 due to rash and negligent driving a bus

bearing registration No.KA-02-C-6660 by its driver and

liability of the insurer of the offending vehicle, the only

point that remains for my consideration in the appeal is:

</p><pre id="pre_2">          Whether     quantum       of  compensation
     awarded by      the Tribunal is just and
</pre><p id="p_5">     reasonable or does it call for enhancement?


</p><p id="p_6">4.    After hearing the learned Counsel for the parties

and perusing the judgment and award of the Tribunal, I

am of the view that the compensation awarded by the

Tribunal is not just and reasonable, it is on the lower

side and therefore, it is deserved to be enhanced.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                             4</span>



</p><p id="p_7">5.   As per Ex.P.1 wound certificate, claimant had

sustained lacerated wound in frontal region of the scalp

measuring about 8 cms x Â½ cms and linear scar

present,   abrasion   on   the   right   temporal   region,

tenderness. Cripitus, abnormal mobility present on the

lower 1/3rd of the right leg and fracture of both bones.

Middle third right leg. Injuries sustained and treatment

taken by him are also evident from discharge summary

Ex.P.2, 3 x-rays, Sketch Ex. P 3, case sheet Ex. P 9 and

supported by oral evidence of the claimant and doctor

examined as P.Ws.1 and 2 respectively.




</p><p id="p_8">6.   P.W.2 - Dr. A. C. Vinod Kumar         in his evidence

has stated that   on examination of the claimant he

found difficulty in walking, pian in the right leg and

knee and he is not able to do brisk walk, and unable to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                              5</span>

run, to    lift weight and to sit crossed leg and squat. He

assessed     the disability at 40% to limb and 13% to

whole body.
</p>
<p id="p_9">

</p><p id="p_10">7.   Considering nature of injuries sustained by the

claimant a sum of Rs.40,000/- is awarded          towards

pain and suffering as against Rs.10,000/- awarded by

the Tribunal under this head.
</p>
<p id="p_11">
</p><p id="p_12">     As Rs.46,529/- awarded by the Tribunal towards

medical expenses is based on medical bills produced by

the claimant for the said sum, the same is just and

proper and there is no scope for enhancement.

</p><p id="p_13">8.   He was treated as inpatient for one month           in

KIMS Hospital, Bangalore. Considering the same, it is

just and proper to award a sum of Rs.15,000/- towards

incidental expenses such as conveyance, nourishment

and attendant charges as against Rs.5,000/- awarded
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                 6</span>

by the Tribunal.
</p>
<p id="p_14">

</p><p id="p_15">9.    The    claimant   claims       to   have   been   earning

Rs.5,000/- per annum by working as a salesman and

dong business.      But it is not established by producing

any document.       In the absence of proof of income

considering his age and year of accident his income is

assessted     at   Rs.4,000/-       per   month    as   against

Rs.3,000/- assessed by the Tribunal. Nature of injuries

suggest that he must have been under rest and

treatment for a period of four months. Considering the

same, a sum of Rs.16,000/- is awarded towards loss of

income      during laid up period as against Rs.9,000/-

awarded by the Tribunal under the said head.



</p><p id="p_16">10.   Considering disability stated by the doctor and an

amount of discomfort and unhappiness which the

claimant has to undergo for the rest of his life, a sum
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                            7</span>

of Rs.20,000/- is awarded towards loss of amenities.



</p><p id="p_17">11.   Regarding awarding of compensation towards loss

of future income, learned Counsel appearing for        the

insurer submits that according to the claimant he was

working as a salesman and doing business and he

continued the same after sustaining injuries. Therefore

question awarding compensation towards loss of future

income does not arise.
</p>
<p id="p_18">

</p><p id="p_19">12.   Learned Counsel for the claimant submits that the

claimant is not in a position to do his work as he was

doing prior to sustaining injuries in the accident and

therefore there is reduction in his income. Considering

the same functional disability is taken at 10%.        The

claimant    is    aged    about     30    years        and

multiplier applicable to his age group is 17.     If so,

loss of future income works out to Rs.82,600/-
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                               8</span>

(Rs.4,000/- x 10% x 12 x 17) and it is awarded as

against Rs.57,600/- awarded by the Tribunal.



</p><p id="p_20">13.   Thus the claimant is entitled for the following

compensation:
</p>
<pre id="pre_3">1)    Pain and suffering          Rs. 40,000/-

2)    Medical expenses            Rs. 46,529/-

3)    Incidental expenses         Rs. 15,000/-

3)    Towards loss of income
      during laid up period       Rs. 16,000/-

4)    Towards loss of amenities   Rs. 20,000/-

5)    Loss of future income       Rs. 81,600/-
                                  _______________
                      Total       Rs.2,19,129/-

Less compensation awarded

by the Tribunal                   Rs.1,28,129/-

</pre><p id="p_21">Additional compensation comes to Rs. 91,000/-

</p><p id="p_22">14.   Accordingly the appeal is allowed in part and the

judgment and award of the Tribunal is modified to the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                   9</span>

extent stated herein above. The claimant is entitled for

additional compensation of Rs.91,000/- with interest at

6% p.a. from the date of claim petition till the date of

realisation.
</p>
<p id="p_23">

</p><p id="p_24">15.     The Insurance Companies - respondents 1 and 3

are directed to deposit the additional compensation

amount with interest in equal proportion as has been

held by the Tribunal within two months from the date of

receipt of a copy of this judgment from which,

Rs.50,000/- with proportionate interest is ordered to be

deposited in FD in the name of the claimant in any

nationalised or scheduled Bank               or post office for a

period of 6 years, renewable once every two years, with

a     right   of   option   for   him   to    withdraw   interest

periodically and the remaining amount is ordered to be

released in his favour.
