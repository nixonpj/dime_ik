  (Smt. Sajan Devi &amp; Anr. Vs. Pali Central Co-operative Bank)

                Date of Order     ::      30.10.2012

                           PRESENT

        HON'BLE MR JUSTICE GOPAL KRISHAN VYAS


Mr. Manoj Bhandari, for the petitioner.
</p><p id="p_2">Mr. Kamal Dave, for the respondents.
</p><p id="p_3">Mr. Ashvini Gehlot, Dy. Govt. Counsel.
</p>
<p id="p_4">
</p><p id="p_5">            The instant writ petition has been filed by legal heirs

of late Shri Shantilal Shah, who was working on the post of

Branch Manager in the Pali Central Cooperative Bank Limited,

Pali. Late Shri Shantilal Shah died while in service but during his

service period, he was placed under suspension in contemplation

of enquiry but later on reinstated in service. Unfortunately, the

enquiry initiated against him was not finalized till his death.

</p><p id="p_6">            Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that

although the retiral benefits of late Shri Shantilal Shah have

been paid but amount of suspension period commencing from

21.1.1991 to 07.07.1999 has not been paid, therefore, the

respondents may be directed to calculate the amount of full

salary of the suspension period as per the official record and

make payment of all the dues after making proper fixation.

</p><p id="p_7">            Learned counsel for the respondents vehemently

opposed the prayer made by the counsel for the petitioner and

submits that due to pendency of enquiry, late Shri Shantilal Shah

was placed under suspension and during the suspension period,

he was not allowed to work, therefore, on the basis of principle
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                   2</span>

of "no work - no pay", he is not entitled for full salary of

suspension period and other benefits.
</p>
<p id="p_8">            After considering entire facts of the case, this Court

is of the opinion that enquiry initiated against late Shri Shantilal

Shah was not finalized during his life time and he died during the

pendency of the said enquiry while in service, therefore,

obviously, no punishment was made against him, therefore, his

legal heirs are entitled for all the benefits including the salary for

the period of suspension period and other dues. Hence, this writ

petition is disposed of with the direction to the respondents to

calculate the amount of salary of late Shri Shantilal for the

suspension period within a period of three months and after

calculating the amount as per official record, the salary and other

benefits may be paid to the petitioners.
