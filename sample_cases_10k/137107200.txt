the defendants started harassing the plaintiff on one pretext or the other, the

property and are liable to vacate the same and pay the damages/mesne profits 

@ Rs. 200/­ per day after filing of this suit. Legal Notice dated 10.11.08 was 

also issued to the defendants but of no avail. As the defendants failed to vacate

that. Being a civil suit for partition, this suit is to be decided on the basis of

No. 38836. It is further claimed by the defendants that defendant No. 1 has 

transferred his property measuring 108 Sq. Yards bearing plot NO. 14 out of 

khasra No. 698 situated in Village­ Gokalpuri in the Abadi of Harijan Basti, 

East Gokalpur Illaqa Shahdra, Delhi­32.  The defendant No. 1 further claimed 

to have sold the suit property to defendant No. 2 vide GPA dated 07.11.2003 

registered with sub­registrar vide registration No. 49231. The plaintiffs by way 

of this suit have prayed to pass decree of mandatory injunction directing the 

defendants to vacate the suit property and hand over the vacant and physical 

possession, permanent injunction, declaring the GPA executed by the plaintiff 

in favour of defendant No. 1 as null and voide and for damages/mesne profits.

the main issue to be adjudicated remained as to  whether the defendants have 

become the owner of the suit property ?  On the basis of the GPA executed by 

the plaintiff in favour of the defendant No. 1 dated 14.10.2002. There is no 

dispute for denial of the ownership of the plaintiffs and the defendants claimed 

right,   title   or   interest   in   the   suit   property   only   through   the   plaintiffs.     As 

regards the contentions of the defendant No. 1 that he transferred the other 

property measuring 108 Sq. Yards to the plaintiff in lieu of selling the suit 

property by the plaintiff appears to have no basis as the said property is not in

the   name   of   defendant   No.   1   as   it   is   proved   from   the   testimony   of   the 

witnesses. The defendant No. 1 failed to prove that he is the Sunil Kumar who 

was the owner of the said property measuring 108 yards sold to the plaintiff 

and there is no material on record to reach this conclusion.

derived his title through the plaintiff. The plaintiff claimed that he has revoked

cancellation of GPA registered on 23.09.2009 before sub­registrar and prayed

ownership of the plaintiff is   admitted by the   defendants who claims   title 

through him. As held in  judgment reported as Uttam Chand Kothari Vs. Gauri 

Shankar Jalan, AIR 2007 Gau. 20,  admission in the written statement cannot 

be allowed to be withdrawn. In view of this legal position of the <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_4">Evidence Act</a>,

Scope of Power of Attorney 

</p><p id="p_83">         13.A power of attorney is not an instrument of transfer in regard to any 

right,   title   or   interest   in   an   immovable   property.   The   power   of   attorney   is 

creation of an agency whereby the grantor authorizes   the grantee to do the 

acts   specified   therein,   on   behalf   of   grantor,   which   when   executed   will   be 

binding on the grantor as if done by him( see <a href="/doc/515323/" id="a_30">section 1A</a> and <a href="/doc/212404/" id="a_31">section 2</a> of the 

Powers of Attorney Act, 1882). It is revocable or terminable at any time unless 

it is made irrevocable in a manner known to law. Even an irrevocable attorney 

does not have the effect of transferring title to the grantee. In state of <a href="/doc/1422834/" id="a_32">Rajasthan

ownership   without   transferring   possession.   Similarly,   it   is   also   possible   to 

transfer possession without transferring ownership. It is relevant to note here 

that in this case neither the ownership had been transferred nor possession of

stretch of imagination can be considered to be the owner of the suit property 

on the basis of documents executed by the defendant No. 1 in her favour. The 

transaction in question is not commercial in nature and the plaintiff executed 

GPA   in   favour   of   defendant   No.   1   merely   out   of   love   and   affection.   The 

defendant No. 1 failed to prove regarding any transfer of property by him in

will.  Even if these documents were executed by the defendant No. 1 in favour

proved that the plaintiff executed the GPA in favour of defendant No. 1 and the 

transaction was merely out of love and affection and was not commercial in 

nature.  It also appears absurd and unreasonable that the plaintiff has sold the 

suit property  to the  defendant No. 1. It appears  that the all the  documents 

relied by the defendants i.e. regarding mutation of the property, payment of the 

property tax, other bills or all after the filing of this suit by the plaintiff.  The 

testimony of the plaintiff in one way or the other remain unimpeached. As the 

defendant No. 1 did not have valid title to the suit property on the basis of GPA 

executed   by   the   plaintiff,   the   defendant   No.   1   could   not   have   further 

transferred the same to the defendant No.2. The plaintiff proved the documents 

regarding defendant No. 1 being disowned by him, cancellation of GPA and 

publication of the notice. The defendant No. 1 on the other failed to prove by 

cogent evidence that he is also known as Sunil Dutt. Rather it is not the case of 

the   defendant  No.  1  in  the  WS  that he  is  also  known  as  Sunil Dutt.    The

contention   of   the   plaintiff   appears   to   be   sustainable.   The   defendant   No.   1 

admitted   during   cross­examination   that   he   executed   the   GPA   in   favour   of 

defendant No. 2 without any consideration, defendant No. 2 has no source of 

income, he received the notices from the plaintiff regarding cancellation of the 

GPA executed in his favour and the GPA was canceled by the plaintiff. In view 

of   this   testimony,   the   defence   of   the   defendants   have   been   shattered.   The 

defendant   No.   2   also   admitted   the   cancellation   of   GPA   by   the   plaintiff   in 

favour   of   defendant   No.   1   and   the   fact   that   defendant   No.   1   executed   the 

documents   in   favour   of   defendant   No.   2   without   any   consideration.   The 

defence of the defendants is therefore not sustainable.

</p><p id="p_114">29.      In the present case,  the plaintiff  is the owner of the suit property and 

there is nothing on record to infer that he has sold the suit property to the 

defendant   No.   1   or   consequently   ever     handed   over   the   possession.   The 

defendant No. 1 and 2  further failed to prove that the possession was handed 

over   as   part   performance   of   the   agreement   to   sell   and   defendants   were 

permitted to use the suit property as permissive user. Thus the only inference 

which   can   be   drawn   in  view  of  the   pleadings   and   evidence  led  is   that  the 

plaintiff  is the owner of the suit property and is entitled to the possession of 

the same. As the plaintiff is the owner of the suit property the documents on 

the basis of which the defendants are claiming the ownership right in the suit 

property are null and void and plaintiff is entitled for decree of declaration. 

Issue No.  IV is  decided in favour of the plaintiffs and against the defendants.

plaintiff is seeking the possession of the suit property and therefore the suit of 

the   plaintiff   is   not   maintainable.   This   contention   of   Ld.   Counsel   for   the

the suit property unauthorizedly.   In the present matter the plaintiff has not led 

any specific evidence in respect of the same. Plaintiff has simply pleaded and

suit. Thus, plaintiff will be entitled to damages at the rate of Rs.6,000/­ per 

month from the date of filing of the suit till the date of gaining possession of 

the  suit property. In respect of the claim towards interest on mesne profits, the 

Hon'ble   High   Court   of   Delhi   in   the   case   of  Arya   Orphanage  (supra)   was 

pleased to hold that interest is an integral part of mesne profits and therefore 

the same has to be allowed in the computation of mesne profits itself. Plaintiff 

would thus be entitled to grant of interest on mesne profits. I, therefore, grant 

interest to the plaintiff at the rate of 8% per annum on the mesne profits so 

granted from the date of filing of the suit till the date of gaining possession. 

This   issue   is,   therefore,  decided   accordingly   in   favour   of   the   plaintiff   and 

against the defendants.
