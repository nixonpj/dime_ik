  IN THE HIGH COURT OF JUDICATURE FOR RAJASTHAN
                        AT JODHPUR
                          ORDER
   S.B.C. SALES TAX REVISION NO.139/2011
          Asstt. Commercial Taxes Officer
                      Vs.
M/s Onkara Roadways Sanjay Gandhi Transport Nagar

Date of Order               :                 08.05.2013

                        PRESENT

      HON'BLE MR JUSTICE VIJAY BISHNOI

Mr Vinit Kumar Mathur, for the petitioner
Mr Dinesh Mehta, for the respondent

BY THE COURT:</pre>

<p id="p_1">          This revision petition has been preferred

by the petitioner under section 86 of the Rajasthan

Sales Tax Act, 1994 (for short 'the Act of 1994'

hereinafter) against the judgment dated 28.10.2010

passed by the Rajasthan Tax Board, Ajmer (for short

'the Tax Board' hereinafter), whereby the orders

passed by the Assessing Authority as well as the

Deputy Commissioner (Appeals), Ist, Commercial

Taxes, Jaipur (for short 'the Deputy Commissioner'

hereinafter)    dated     19.01.2005     and     24.01.2006

respectively have been quashed and set aside.

</p><p id="p_2">          Brief   facts    of    the   case    are   that   on

15.01.2005, vehicle No.RJ14-1G-7915 was checked

near Balicha bypass and it was found that the transit
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                 2</span>

pass for Invoice No.06367 dated 13.01.2005 for the

value of goods amounting to Rs.4,06,041.00 was not

obtained.     The Assessing Authority had found that

since the transit pass had not been prepared from

above      mentioned      consignment,         there   was   an

intention to evade the tax duty and as such, the

Assessing Authority had imposed the penalty under

<a href="/doc/1645178/" id="a_1">section 80</a> of the Sales Tax Act, 1994 (for short 'the

Act   of     1994'   hereinafter)        vide    order    dated

19.01.2005. The respondent had challenged the said

order of the Assessing       Authority before the Deputy

Commissioner (Appeals) by way of an appeal, which

came to be dismissed by order dated 24.01.2006,

while confirming the order passed by the Assessing

Authority.
</p>
<p id="p_3">             Being aggrieved with the orders dated

24.01.2006 and 19.01.2005, the respondent has

preferred an appeal before the Tax Board and the Tax

Board vide order dated 28.10.2010, has allowed the

appeal while observing that the goods transported in

the vehicle    No.RJ14-1G-7915 had been passed out

of State of Rajasthan and had not been sold in the

State of Rajasthan and, therefore, the action of the

Assessing     Authority    of       imposing    penalty   under
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                3</span>

<a href="/doc/1645178/" id="a_2">section 80(2)</a> of the Act of 1994 was not proper. The

petitioner has challenged the order dated 28.10.2010

passed by Tax Board on various grounds in this

revision petition.
</p>
<p id="p_4">           It is contended by the learned counsel for

the petitioner that as per the provisions of sub-

section (2) of <a href="/doc/1645178/" id="a_3">section 80</a> of the Act of 1994, once it is

proved that the transit pass has not been obtained

for the goods passes through the State of Rajasthan,

then it will be presumed that such goods have been

sold within the State by the owner, the driver or the

person incharge of the vehicle or the carrier or the

goods. It is further contended by the learned counsel

for the petitioner that there was no dispute to the

fact that the respondent-firm, or the driver of the

vehicle, which was transporting the goods of the

respondent-firm, have not obtained transit pass in

respect   of   the   goods     transported      vide   Invoice

No.06367 dated 13.01.2005 and, therefore, the

Assessing Authority has not committed any illegality

in levying the       penalty       in view of   presumption

attached to the provisions of sub-section (2) of

<a href="/doc/1645178/" id="a_4">Section 80</a> of the Act of 1994. However, the learned

Tax Board has illegally set aside the same without
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                            4</span>

taking into consideration of this aspect of the matter

and, therefore, the order passed by the Tax Board

dated 28.10.2010 is liable to be set aside.

</p><p id="p_5">           Per   contra,   learned   counsel   for   the

respondent has supported the judgment passed by

the learned Tax Board and has argued that when it is

proved that the goods have not been sold in State of

Rajasthan and the consignment had been passed out

from State of Rajasthan, then no penalty can be

imposed as envisaged under <a href="/doc/1645178/" id="a_5">section 82</a> of the Act of

1994.
</p>
<p id="p_6">           This Court has considered the submissions

made by the learned counsel for rival parties and has

perused the order passed by the Tax Board.

</p><p id="p_7">           The learned Tax Board has observed that

it is not in dispute that the goods transported by the

transporter had been passed out from State of

Rajasthan and had not been sold in State of

Rajasthan, then it was not proper on the part of the

Assessing Authority to impose penalty under <a href="/doc/1645178/" id="a_6">section

82</a> of the Act of 1994.     This Court is of the opinion

that the learned Tax Board has not committed any

illegality in quashing the penalty levied by the

Assessing Authority particularly in view of the fact
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                            5</span>

that there is no dispute about the fact that the goods

transported had been passed out from State of

Rajasthan and had not been sold in State of

Rajasthan and in such circumstances, no substantial

question of law arises in this revision petition.

</p><p id="p_8">           Accordingly, this sales tax revision petition

fails and is hereby dismissed.
