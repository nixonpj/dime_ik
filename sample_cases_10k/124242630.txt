                      an assessment order on 30.03.2014 and sustained the claim of the petitioner. In

                      the meanwhile, the petitioner filed his return for AY 2009-2010, in which he

                      declared the sale of the second tranche of 20% of the shareholding in RIDM and

                      declared a total consideration of Rs.11,24,14,809/-. He also claimed that he paid

                      Rs.40 lakhs out of the said amount as advance for purchase of immovable

                      property in Alibaug in Rajgad District, Maharashtra, to construct a residential

                      The Assessing Officer disallowed the claim of the petitioner for a sum of Rs.6.50

                      Crores, under <a href="/doc/1030207/" id="a_8">Section 54</a> of the Act, on the ground that the flats purchased by

                      the petitioner were two separate residential units and consequently, he was not

                      entitled to claim the benefit under <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_9">Section 54F</a> of the Act.



</p><p id="p_23">                            15.The petitioner challenged the assessment order by preferring an

                      appeal before the Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) [in short “CIT(A)”].

                      The CIT(A), by order dated 29.07.2013, allowed the appeal and sustained the

                      deduction claimed by the petitioner under <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_10">Section 54F</a> of the Act. It must be

                      pointed out that in the very same order the CIT(A) also dealt with the appeal

                      preferred by the petitioner in respect of AY 2008-2009 as some of the issues

                      were common to the two appeals preferred by him. The issue pertaining to the

                      deduction claimed by the petitioner under <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_11">Section 54F</a> of the Act, arose only in

                      the appeal preferred with respect to AY 2009-2010.



</p><p id="p_24">                            16.Challenging the order of CIT(A), the Revenue filed an appeal before

                      the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal, Chennai, [in short the “Tribunal”]. The

                      the Revenue and dismissed the appeal pertaining to AY 2008-2009 and partly

                      allowed the appeal pertaining to AY 2009-2010.

</p>
<p id="p_36">                            22.By order dated 02.06.2017, the learned Singe Judge of this Court

                      observed that the CIT(A) by common order dated 29.07.2017, had held that the

                      petitioner should be allowed deduction under <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_19">Section 54F</a> of the Act, as the

                      aspects pertaining to the claim had been considered in AY 2008-2009. It was

                      observed that in the order, the CIT(A) had discussed the entire history of the

                      transaction and also the material placed which included the Surveyor's report,

                      whereby a categorical finding was returned that the two flats were conjoined into

                      one flat and it was confirmed that it was a single residential unit. The Assessing

                      Officer by order dated 31.03.2014, in the proceedings under <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_20">Section 143(3)</a> read

                      with <a href="/doc/1837761/" id="a_21">Section 147</a> of the Act, with relation to AY 2008-2009 had also come to the

                      very same conclusion and had allowed deduction under <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_22">Section 54F</a> of the Act.

                      29.07.2013 of the CIT(A), with relation to AY 2008-2009 and 2009-2010, it also

                      simultaneously initiated proceedings under <a href="/doc/1978286/" id="a_23">Section 263</a> of the Act, against the

                      Order of the Assessing Officer, dated 31.03.2014. It was further observed that

                      the Tribunal, was obliged to adjudicate the appeals preferred by the Revenue,

                      with respect to both AY 2008-2009 and 2009-2010. The Tribunal, had considered

                      not only the issue whether the said flats formed one residential unit, but also

                      examined the investment made by the petitioner in the Alibaug property,

                      wherein he had constructed a residential house. The Tribunal also examined the

                      petitioner's claim that he had invested Rs.6.10 Crores in a Capital Gains Account

                      Scheme with Bank of India.
</p>
<p id="p_38">                             24.It was observed by the learned Single Judge, that the Tribunal dealt

                      with all the three aspects in its order dated 08.04.2015. After discussing the

                      three aspects, the Tribunal had remanded the matter back only with respect to

                      the last two issues, namely, claim with respect to investment of Rs.6.10 Crores in

                      the Capital Gains Account Scheme and the investment of Rs.40 Lakhs made by

                      way of advance for purchase of Alibaug property. The learned Single Judge

                      observed that the Tribunal had thought it fit not to entertain the appeal of the

                      Revenue, with respect to the challenge laid to deduction claimed by the

                      petitioner with respect to the flats under <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_24">Section 54F</a> of the Act.

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">                                “13. Furthermore, according to me, as correctly
                                argued by Mr.Senthil, on behalf of the appellant, the
                                view taken by the Assessing Officer in its order dated
                                31.03.2014, was a possible view, and therefore,
                                would not, necessarily, as it sought to be projected on
                                behalf of the Revenue, be categorised as an
                                erroneous view.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">                                13.1. A perusal of the impugned order would show
                                that the respondent has set aside the order and
                                directed the Assessing Officer to revisit the issue, as
                                he, according to him, had faulted to take into account
                                the fact that the subject flats had been purchased via
                                two separate sale deeds, and had separate electricity
                                meter connections. According to me, it appears that
                                the respondent was unnecessarily burdened by the
                                fact that the subject flats were purchased by two
                                separate sale deeds and had separate electricity
                                meter connections. The issue at hand, before the
                                Assessing Officer, in my opinion, was whether or not
                                the subject flats form a single residential unit.</blockquote><p id="p_41">

</p><p id="p_42">                                13.2. The size of the flat, or, that they had separate

                                lead to a conclusion that they were two separate
                                residential units. The Assessing Officer was required
                                to look at other attendant circumstances, which
                                included the survey report, in reaching a conclusion in
                                the matter. Notably, what was available on record,

                                   was not only the survey report, but also the material
                                   provided by the concerned HousingSociety. The
                                   survey report, as it appears, did advert to the fact
                                   that the subject flats formed a single residential unit.

                                   13.3. The learned counsel for the Revenue has not
                                   assailed the survey report before me. Therefore, quite
                                   clearly, there was material available to the Assessing
                                   Officer to come to a possible view, if not, definite
                                   view that the subject flats formed a single residential
                                   unit.

<p id="p_43">                                   13.4. If, that be the conclusion, then, clearly, the
                                   respondent had no jurisdiction to initiate proceedings
                                   under <a href="/doc/1978286/" id="a_25">Section 263</a> of the Act and thereupon, proceed

                      investigation of the facts and to take a decision of merits. It was thereafter,

                      pointed out that the learned Single Judge ought to have dismissed the writ

                      order dated 08.04.2015. It was urged that the Tribunal had not considered

                      whether the flats purchased by the respondent formed a single residential unit.

                      The discussion arose in the course of deciding whether the respondent was

                      prior to the purchase of two residential flats. The learned counsel stated that a

                      Limited, with respect to flat No.612 on 11.04.2006 and immediately thereafter,

                      on 20.04.2006, the respondent herein had intimated to the Secretary of the

                      Housing Society, the scope of the renovation work in flat Nos.612 and 607.

                      Among other works it included “breaking the wall between second bedroom of

                      612 and the passage wall of 607 to combine the two flats”. Permission for such

                      renovation was granted on 28.04.2006. The agreement for purchase of flat

                      No.607 was entered into on 05.05.2006 and the sale deed was executed on

                      23.05.2006. The sale deed with respect to flat No.612 was executed on

                      16.01.2007. It must be kept in mind that the first tranche of sale of 70% of

                      share in RIDM was on 05.05.2007.

</p><p id="p_76">                            41.The Olumpus Co-operative Society Limited, had issued a no objection

                      certificate on 11.04.2006 for sale of flat No.612. The respondent had entered

                      into correspondence with the Society as early as 20.04.2006. In the said letter,

                      the respondent had very clearly stated that he intended to conjoin flat Nos.612

                      and 607 and sought permission for commencing work to that need. Among other

                      works, the respondent also sought permission for “breaking the wall between the

                      second bedroom of 612 and the passage wall of 607 to conjoin the two flats”. It

                      is thus seen that right from the inception, the respondent always wanted to

                      convert the two flats into one single residential unit. The respondent purchased

                      flat No.607 by sale deed dated 23.07.2006 and flat No.612 by sale deed dated

                      16.01.2007.

<p id="p_77">                            42.As had been pointed out earlier, the Society had also recognized the

                      respondent as the owner of one single residential unit alone and had also

                      provided the facility of only one vote in matters relating to the Society. These

                      facts have not been seriously disputed by the appellant herein.



</p><p id="p_78">                            43.The respondent had also filed his return for AY 2008-2009 on

                      31.07.2008 and he claimed deduction under <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_45">Section 54F</a> of the Act. It was taken

                      up for scrutiny and the order dated 22.12.2010, was passed. It was then

                      intimated to the respondent that the Internal Revenue Audit had raised an

                      objection with respect to the claim under <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_46">Section 54F</a> of the Act.

                                  Assessing Officer that the transfer of assets involving
                                  financial transactions took place on 7.7.2008. The
                                  assessee claimed ownership of Flat No.607 and 612
                                  of Olympus Apartments. The Assessing Officer
                                  emphasized on the two conditions for claiming
                                  deduction u/s.54F. According to the Assessing
                                  Officer, the first condition is that the assessee should
                                  not own more than one residential property. The
                                  Assessing Officer is of the opinion that while claiming
                                  deduction u/s.54F of the Act, the assessee as on date
                                  of transfer of long term capital gain, the assessee
                                  should possess only one residential house property. It
                                  is brought out by the Assessing Officer that the
                                  assessee has bought the properties on different
                                  dates, viz., flat Nos.607 and 612 on 23.5.2006 and on
                                  16.1.2007    respectively   and   that   the   assessee
                                  produced copies of permission for renovation by
                                  Olympus Co-operative Housing Property Ltd., for sale
                                  of flat No.612 layout of combined Flat Nos.607/612 of

                                  Associates. The Assessing Officer's question is that on
                                  the date of capital gain transaction, i.e., on 7.7.2008,
                                  how many residential properties the assessee was

                          holding. The Assessing Officer states that the
                          submissions by the assessee did not support the
                          assessee's contention of holding single residential
                          unit on the date of transfer of capital gain and also
                          no supporting documents were received from the
                          assessee regarding completion of renovation and
                          occupation   of   the   assessee    in   the   combined
                          residential unit of flat Nos.607 &amp; 612. Further,
                          according to the Assessing Officer, the second
                          condition for disallowance is that the assessee should
                          have invested in a residential house. The Assessing
                          Officer states that as per deduction of claim u/s.54F,
                          the assessee could invest either in purchase of
                          residential property one year prior to the date of
                          transfer or 2 years after the date of transfer or
                          construct house within 3 years after the date of
                          transfer. In the assessee's case the Assessing Officer
                          states that the assessee has utilized the amount in
                          agricultural land located at Dhokawade Village,
                          Alibag, Taluka of Rajgad District, which is evident
                          from the document describing the property as 'pieces
                          and parcels' of agricultural land. The Assessing
                          Officer also pointed out that the assessee had not
                          produced any proof like approval obtained from the
                          Municipal Corporation of competent Authority for
                          construction of residential property for treating the
                          assessee's agricultural land as residential area."

                          the claim of the petitioner with regard to investment of Rs.6.10

                          remanded for reconsideration, as the same had already been
                          considered in AY 2008-2009. This is quite evident upon perusing
                          paragraph 10 of the Tribunal's order. The relevant observations

                          12.3. Therefore, in my opinion, since, the Revenue did not assail
                          the order of the Tribunal dated 08.04.2015, the respondent could
                          not have exercised powers under Section 263 of the Act to revisit
                          the issue once again, by setting aside the order dated 31.03.2014,
                          passed by the Assessing Officer under Section 143(3) read with

                      the Alibaug property had confined the remand only to the last two aspects. The

                      claim under <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_63">Section 54F</a> of the Act, was not remanded for re-consideration as it

                      had already been considered for AY 2008-2009. This is evident from perusing

                      paragraph 12 of the Tribunal's order. Consequently, the Tribunal did not

                      entertain the appeal of the Revenue, with respect to the challenge relating to the

                      flats and the claim for deduction under <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_64">Section 54F</a> of the Act. The learned

                      the order dated 31.03.2014, was a “possible view” and therefore cannot be

                      categorized as a erroneous view.
