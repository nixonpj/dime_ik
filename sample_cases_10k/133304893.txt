<p id="p_1">             Prayer in this revision is for setting aside the order dated

16.08.2016 to the extent that the Lower Appellate Court, while granting the

benefit of probation to the petitioners, has not extended the benefit of

<a href="/doc/1678715/" id="a_1">Section 12</a> of Probation of Offenders Act.
</p>
<p id="p_2">             Brief facts of the case are that the trial Court, vide judgment

dated 30.09.2015, convicted the petitioners under <a href="/doc/1011035/" id="a_2">Section 323</a>, <a href="/doc/724142/" id="a_3">324</a>, <a href="/doc/1133601/" id="a_4">325</a>,

<a href="/doc/180217/" id="a_5">506</a> IPC read with <a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_6">Section 34</a> IPC and vide order of sentence dated

30.09.2015 imposed two years rigorous imprisonment with fine.

</p><p id="p_3">             The petitioners challenged the said judgment by way of filing

an appeal before the Lower Appellate Court and the Lower Appellate Court

vide its judgment dated 16.08.2016, released the petitioners on probation.

The operative part of the order of the Lower Appellate Court, dated

16.08.2016 is reproduced as under:-

<blockquote id="blockquote_2">         sharp edged weapon rest all injuries are blunt in nature as
         opined by the doctor. The appellants Sarabjit Singh, Amarjit
         Kaur and complainant PW1 and PW2 are related to one
         another and may live in peace in future. Admittedly, litigation
         is pending between them. Amarjit Kaur is about 65 years,
         Sarbjit Singh about 43 years, Rupinder Singh about 34 years
         and Simran Singh is about 33 years of age as mentioned in
         their statements recorded under <a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_7">Section 313</a> Cr.P.C. They are
         first offenders and not previous convicts as there is nothing as
         such on the record. Even modern trend of penology also leans
         towards reformation of offenders so as to make them useful
         citizen of society. FIR in this case was registered in the year
         2008 and since the year 2009 appellants have been facing trial
         and after the conviction in the year 2015, appearing before the
         appellate court. Taking into consideration all above mentioned
         facts and circumstances, this Court is of the view that it is
         expedient to grant the benefit of probation to the appellants
         under <a href="/doc/14315/" id="a_8">section 4</a> of the Probation of Offenders Act 1958. The
         probation of <a href="/doc/167447/" id="a_9">Offenders Act</a> 1958 is a milestone in the progress
         of the modern trend of reform in the field of penology. It is the
         result of recognition of the doctrine that the object of criminal
         law is more to reform an individual offender then to punish
         him. As such however the conviction of the appellants under
         <a href="/doc/724142/" id="a_10">Sections 324</a>, <a href="/doc/1011035/" id="a_11">323</a>, <a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_12">34</a>, <a href="/doc/180217/" id="a_13">506</a> IPC has been upheld but the order
         on the quantum of sentence under said provisions of <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_14">IPC</a> is
         hereby modified. Instead of awarding the substantive sentene
         as per order of Ld. trial Court under the said provisions of
         <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_15">IPC</a>, they /appellants are ordered to be released on probation
         on their furnishing probation bonds in the sum of Rs.50,000/-
         with on surety each in the like amount for a period of one year
         and to appear and receive the sentence whenever called upon
         during such period and in the meantime to keep peace and be
         of good behaviour. Fine deposited by the appellants before the
         learned Trial Court be treated as costs of litigation.</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">

</p><p id="p_5">            Learned counsel for the petitioners has relied upon the

judgment of 2011 (2) RCR (Criminal) 855 <a href="/doc/129262589/" id="a_16">Paramjit Singh vs. State of

Haryana</a> where, while allowing a criminal appeal filed by the accused

person, this Court has granted the benefit of <a href="/doc/14315/" id="a_17">Section 4</a> of the Probation of

Offenders Act and has released the accused on probation with the

conditions that he shall execute a bond for good behaviour for a period of

two years and he shall be subject to the supervision of the Probation Officer,

subject to the conditions laid down in <a href="/doc/167447/" id="a_18">Probation of Offenders Act</a>. It was

also held that since the accused was released on probation, the same may

not effect on his service career, in view of <a href="/doc/1678715/" id="a_19">Section 12</a> of the Probation of the

Offenders Act.

the said period has already expired and during the intervening period, the

petitioners have neither misused the concession of probation nor are

are young persons and they want to pursue their career abroad and the

judgment dated 16.08.2016 granting them probation, may not effect their

service career, it is clarified that the petitioners who were released on

probation and period of probation already been over and subsequently, the

petitioners were not found in any other case or misusing the concession of

probation, the judgment dated 16.08.2016 may not effect the service career

of the petitioners, in view of <a href="/doc/1678715/" id="a_21">Section 12</a> of the probation of <a href="/doc/167447/" id="a_22">Offenders Act</a>.
