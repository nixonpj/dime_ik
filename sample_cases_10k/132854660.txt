<p id="p_3">                             Learned APP waives notice on behalf of the State.

                             With the consent of the parties present revision application

                     is being disposed of at this stage itself.
</p>
<p id="p_4">                             In view of the submissions advanced at the Bar and the

                     order this Court proposes to pass there is no need to set out the

                     facts leading to the present case in extenso.
</p>
<p id="p_5">                             Sole Petitioner herein was tried in respect of an occurrence

                     that had taken place on 29.03.1999. Petitioner was charged and

                     tried under <a href="/doc/1101188/" id="a_1">Sections 379</a> and <a href="/doc/1293807/" id="a_2">461</a> of the Penal Code. On a

                     consideration of the materials brought on record by the

                     prosecution he was found and held guilty for the offence(s)

                     punishable under <a href="/doc/1101188/" id="a_3">Sections 379</a> and <a href="/doc/1293807/" id="a_4">461</a> of the Penal Code and

                     sentenced to undergo R.I. for 02 years besides imposition of fine

                     having default clause(s).
</p>
<p id="p_6">                             It is to be recorded herein that petitioner along with 03

                     other accuseds were tried and convicted. The co- convicts/co-

                     accuseds filed different appeals before learned Sessions Judge. All
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                       2</span>




of them were clubbed together, heard and disposed of by order

dated 20th April, 2010 passed in Criminal Appeal nos. 80, 86, 87

and 88 of 2009. Learned appellate Court, on a consideration of the

evidence on record, confirmed the judgment and order of

conviction passed by learned trial Court in so far as the petitioner

is concerned.
</p>
<p id="p_7">       Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that petitioner

herein had to undergo the ordeal/rigor of trial for nearly 10 years .

For all these years he had to face with excruciating circumstances

in fighting the criminal litigation. Learned trial Court has found

that there is no previous conviction    against the petitioner. It is

contended that one of the co-accuseds/co-convicts moved this

Court in Cr. Rev. no. 1114 of 2010 (Mahesh Patwa versus State of

Bihar) in which this Court has taken a view that a lesser

punishment, in the facts and circumstances of the case, would sub

serve the cause of justice .It is contended that petitioner too

deserve consideration in so far as the quantum of sentence is

concerned.
</p>
<p id="p_8">       Learned A.P.P., on the other hand, supported the two

impugned judgment and order of conviction of Courts below. It is

contended that there is/are concurrent findings of guilt recorded by

the two Courts below which have not been shown to be perverse

as such this Court may not be interfered with the findings of guilt.

</p><p id="p_9">       Having considered the submissions advanced on behalf of

the parties, this Court is satisfied that in the facts and

circumstances of the case, a lesser punishment would sub serve the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                             3</span>




      cause of justice. Consequently, while maintaining his conviction

      the sentence of R.I. for 02 years awarded under <a href="/doc/1101188/" id="a_5">Sections 379</a> and

      <a href="/doc/1293807/" id="a_6">461</a> of the Penal Code is reduced to R.I. for 18 months. The other

      part(s)/ condition(s) of sentence shall remain unaltered.

</p><p id="p_10">             With this modification in sentence only, the application is

      dismissed.
