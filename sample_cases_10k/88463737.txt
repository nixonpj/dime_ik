                                      ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">1.                The present revision petition is filed by the revisionist against
the order dated 18.1.2012, passed by Sh. Vipin Kharb,            Ld. Metropolitan
Magistrate, Dwarka Courts, Delhi, vide which the complaint of the
complainant was dismissed u/s 204(4) <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_1">Cr.P.C</a> for non prosecution.
</p>

<p id="p_2">2.                 Aggrieved from the impugned order, revisionist has filed the
present revision petition on the ground that the impugned order is bad in
law and the court below has wrongly dismissed the complaint case of the
revisionist and prays that impugned order be set aside.
</p>

<p id="p_3">3.                I have heard Sh. Sunil Gupta,    Ld. counsel for the revisionist
and have also gone through the relevant record including the             impugned
order.
</p>

<p id="p_4">4.                Ld. counsel for the revisionist has submitted that on 18.1.2012,
he failed to appear before the court below, as inadvertently he noted the
wrong date of hearing i.e 19.1.2012 in place of 18.1.2012. Ld counsel for
the revisionist has further submitted that on 19.1.2012 when the counsel
for the complainant along with the AR appeared before the court below, it


CR No. 175/2012                                                            Page 1/2
 was revealed that the case was dismissed on 18.1.2012. Ld. counsel for the
revisionist has further submitted that           due to the mistake on the part of
the clerk of counsel for the complainant, the PF could not be filed in time.
</p><p id="p_5">                  Ld. Counsel for the revisionist has further submitted that non
appearance of the complainant or his counsel on 18.1.2012 and non filing of
PF, was neither intentional nor deliberate but due to the reason stated
above and prays that the order passed by the court below be set aside.
</p>

<p id="p_6">5.                From the perusal of record it shows that the accused was never
served in the present case and the present petition was dismissed for not
taking steps and non deposit of cost of Rs. 500/- before DLSA.
</p><p id="p_7">                  The reason stated in the revision petition for not taking steps
and wrong noting of date, is duly supported with an affidavit of Sh. Rajesh
Patsaria, AR of the complainant. As such, I allow the revision petition of the
revisionist       and set aside the order dated 18.1.2012 subject to deposit of
previous cost of Rs. 500/- with DLSA , till the next date.
</p>

<p id="p_8">6.                Revisionist is   directed to     appear before    the court of
Sh. Vipin Kharb,        Ld.   Metropolitan Magistrate, Dwarka Courts/Successor
Court on 31.7.2012 and the court below is directed to proceed with the
matter in accordance with law.
</p><p id="p_9">                  Trial Court Record be sent back along with the copy of this
order and revision file be consigned to record room.
