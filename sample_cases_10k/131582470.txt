      This Miscellaneous First Appeal is filed under
<a href="/doc/93665491/" id="a_1">Section 173(1)</a> of Motor Vehicles Act, praying to modify
the judgment and award dated 01.01.2018 passed in
MVC No.702/2015 on the file of II Addl. Senior Civil
Judge and MACT, Kalaburagi and allow this appeal by
enhancing the compensation amount of Rs.14,99,999/-
only as claimed by the appellant before this Court.

     This appeal coming on for Admission this day, the
Court delivered the following:


                         JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">       Heard the learned counsel for the appellant/

injured - claimant and the learned counsel for the

Insurer and perused the impugned judgment and the

records.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">       2.      The appellant/ injured - claimant has filed

this        appeal    seeking       enhancement.      The

appellant/injured - claimant has been awarded a total

sum of Rs.2,22,900/- along with interest @ 6% per

annum from the date of petition till the realization while

allowing her claim petition in MVC No.702/2015 on the

file of the II Additional Senior Civil Judge and Motor
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                               3</span>




Accident Claims Tribunal, Kalaburagi        (for short, 'the

Tribunal').
</p>
<p id="p_4">
</p><p id="p_5">      3.      The Tribunal has awarded the aforesaid sum

under the following heads:
</p>
<p id="p_6">
</p><pre id="pre_2">                  Heads                   Compensation
  Pain and Suffering                           Rs.20,000/-
  Attendant     Charges,   Food   and          Rs.14,000/-
  Conveyance Charges
  Loss f Future Income                         Rs.73,400/-
  Medical Expenditure                          Rs.94,900/-
  Loss of Income During Treatment               Rs.5,600/-
  Loss of Amenities and Nutrition              Rs.15,000/-
  Food
                  Total                     Rs.2,22,900/-



</pre><p id="p_7">      4.      It is submitted that there is no dispute that

the appellant/ injured - claimant suffered injuries when

the Auto-rickshaw in which she was travelling turned

turtle. The negligence of the driver of the Auto-rickshaw

is not disputed before this Court.      The liability of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                4</span>




Insurance company is also not disputed. The learned

counsel for the appellant/injured - claimant argues for

enhancement contending that the appellant - injured

would be entitled for enhancement in the amounts

awarded towards (a) pain and suffering, (b) attendant

charges, (c) food and conveyance charges, (d) loss of

future income, (e) loss of income during laid up period

and (f) loss of amenities.
</p>
<p id="p_8">

</p><p id="p_9">      5.     The learned counsel is seeking enhancement

under these heads relying upon the schedule evolved for

settlement     in   Lok-Adalath      contending      that    the

appellant/    injured    -   claimant   has    suffered     three

fractures viz., (i) fracture left rami (which is mal-united)

</p><p id="p_10">(ii) fracture of left iliac bone, and (iii) fracture of left neck

femur. These are major injuries, and according to the

Schedule evolved for settlement in the case of major

fractures, a minimum sum of Rs.30,000/- is awarded

towards pain and suffering and another sum of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                             5</span>




Rs.30,000/- towards loss of amenities.            But, the

Tribunal has awarded Rs.20,000/- and Rs.15,000/-

respectively.    Further, the Tribunal has taken the

income at Rs.6,000/- per month and the functional

disability as 6% despite three major injuries for the

purposes of assessment of loss of future earning ability

and loss of income during the laid up period.          The

Tribunal ought to have taken the income of the

appellant/injured - claimant at Rs.7,500/- per month

and higher functional disability because of the multiple

fractures suffered.
</p>
<p id="p_11">
</p><p id="p_12">     6.    The    learned   counsel   for   the   Insurance

Company submits that these three fracture injuries are

not found in the records as per the Discharge Summary,

but are mentioned only in the Disability Certificate. The

Discharge Summary refers only to the fracture of left

rami. Therefore, the assessment of functional disability

taken by the Tribunal at 6% is just and appropriate.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                 6</span>




However,    the    learned   counsel     for   the    Insurance

Company does not dispute that a sum of Rs.30,000/-

each can be awarded under pain and suffering and loss

of amenities because the mal union of the fracture of

the left rami is established.
</p>
<p id="p_13">
</p><p id="p_14">      7.    The learned counsel for the              appellant/

injured - claimant does not dispute that the Discharge

Summary refers to only one of the fractures viz.,

fracture of left rami. There is also no dispute that there

is mal union of this fracture.          In which event, the

disability cannot be very marginal, and the assessment

of functional disability at 6% will be marginal. The

appropriate percentage of disability, given the fact that

the appellant was aged 27 years at the time of the

accident and injury is in the pelvic area, could be taken

at 10% to arrive at just and reasonable compensation.


</p><p id="p_15">      8.    This   Court     for    reasons    of   consistency,

uniformity and adherence to rules of standardization,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                  7</span>




adopts the schedule award for settlement in Lok-Adalat

when there is no evidence of actual income, and

according to such schedule, the notional income would

be Rs.7,500/- per month in cases arising from accidents

in the year 2014. There is no reason why this notional

income of Rs.7,500/- per month should not be taken.

Therefore, it would be appropriate to take the income of

the appellant/injured - claimant at Rs.7,500/- per

month. If compensation towards loss of future income

is computed with these changes, the appellant/ injured

</p><p id="p_16">- claimant would be entitled for enhancement.


</p><p id="p_17">     9.      The    appellant/       injured   -   claimant   has

suffered fracture in the pubic area and this indisputably

would have been confined to bed for a minimum of three

months resulting in loss of income during this period.

Therefore,    she    is   entitled      for    enhancement     of

compensation towards loss of income                  during the

treatment i.e. for a period of three months.                  The
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                             8</span>




appellant/ injured - claimant, who could be confined to

bed for three months after surgical procedure, would

also be entitled for a sum of Rs.20,000/-towards

attendant/food/conveyance charges would be more

appropriate. As such, the appellant/ injured - claimant

is entitled for enhancement to a sum of Rs.1,27,500/-,

as per the table mentioned below:
