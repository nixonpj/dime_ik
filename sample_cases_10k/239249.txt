CITATION:
 1972 AIR 2538		  1973 SCR  (1) 801
 CITATOR INFO :
 RF	    1988 SC 624	 (5)


ACT:
Jammu  and Kashmir Municipal Act, Samvat 2008, ss. 129,	 238
and  239-Notice	 affixed to property-No proof  of  attempted
service-If  sufficient-Grant  of 24 hours time	to  demolish
structures  in	which  business	 was  being  carried   on-No
opportunity given to repair-If time given reasonable.



HEADNOTE:
Buildings  and	structures  in which  the  respondents	were
carrying  on  their business were ordered to  be  demolished
under<a href="/doc/1326525/" id="a_1"> s. 129</a> of the Jammu and Kashmir Municipal Act,  Samvat
2008.	Only 24 hours time was given to the  respondent	 for
dismantling  the structures.  The notices were never  served
upon the respondents but were affixed on the premises.	 The
municipality  demolished the properties.  In  writ  petition
filed by the respondents the High Court held that the orders
passed by the appellants were illegal.
Dismissing the appeal to this Court,
HELD : Owing to the noncompliance with the provisions of<a href="/doc/1326525/" id="a_2"> ss.
238</a> and <a href="/doc/1326525/" id="a_3">239</a> of the Act, the action taken by the municipality
in  the	 matter of demolition must be held  to	be  entirely
illegal and contrary to law. [811A-B]
(1)  <a href="/doc/1326525/" id="a_4">Section 239</a> of the Act gives the procedure relating  to
authentication	of service of a valid notice.  Under  sub-s.
(i)  every notice may be served in the manner  provided	 for
the  service  of  summons in the C.P.C. so  far	 as  may  be
applicable.  Even accepting the contention of the  appellant
that the respondents refused to accept the notices and	that
was  the  reason for affecting service	by  affixation,	 the
provisions of O. 5, r. 9 of the Code were not complied with.
No  proof was adduced by way of an affidavit of the  process
server or any other officer regarding the attempts to  serve
the  notices.  Production by the respondents of the  notices
or admission that there was affixture did not dispense	with
compliance with the requirements of the statutory provisions
contained  in s.. 239 in the matter of service, of  notices.
[809F-G; 810A-C]
(2)  (a)  <a href="/doc/1326525/" id="a_5">Section  238</a> of the Act provide-&amp;  that  when	 any
notice under the Act requires any act to be done, for  which
no time is fixed by the Act, a reasonable time for doing the
same shall be specified in the notice.	<a href="/doc/1326525/" id="a_6">Section 129</a> does not
specify or fix any time for complying with the notice issued
under that section.  Therefore, a reasonable time for  doing
the  acts  required  to	 be done by the	 notice	 had  to  be
specified  [809F; 810C D]
(b)  <a href="/doc/1326525/" id="a_7">Section  129</a>  also contemplates that the owner  may  be
required either	    to remove the structure or to cause such
repairs to be made to it as may be considered necessary	 for
public safety.	But, in the present case, no time was  given
for repairing and the owner or occupier of the Property	 was
straight  way  required.  to demolish the  building  or	 the
structure.   Considering  that	at  no	previous  stage	 the
officers of the municipality had formed the opinion that the
Structures  were  in such a dangerous  condition  that	they
should	he  demolished,	 the  drastic  step  of	  demolition
directed  to be taken in 24 hours, appears, on the  face  of
it, to be harsh and unusual [810D-G]
2--L172Sup.CI/73
802
Therefore,  the	 notices issued to the respondents  did	 not
comply	with the provisions of<a href="/doc/1326525/" id="a_8"> s. 238</a> and the  time  granted
was  so short that it was not possible for  the	 respondents
either	to comply with the notices or to take any  effective
steps in the matter of filing an appeal or revisions to	 the
appropriate authorities. [810H]
[The conclusions and observations of the High Court relating
to   collusion	between	 various  government  officers	 for
dispossessing  the  respondents from  their  properties	 and
demolishing  them and the mala fide nature of  their  action
have  not  been	 dealt with by this Court  in  view  of	 the
decision  regarding  the illegality and	 invalidity  of	 the
demolition carried out pursuant to the notices issued  under
s.  129.  Hence, the observations made by the High Court  or
the  conclusions  reached by it on all	those  other  points
would  not  be	binding	 in any	 proceedings  which  may  be
initiated or taken or continued either by the respondents or
the appellants under law [808H; 811B-C]

M.   Qamaruddin,  for respondents (in.C.A. Nos.	 145-147  of
1969).
</p><p id="p_5">The Judgment of the Court was delivered by
Grover,	 J. These appeals arise out of a common judgment  of
the Jammu &amp; Kashmir High Court-given in four writ  petitions
filed by the respondents.
</p><p id="p_6">The  respondents  are  stated to be  purchasers	 of  certain
premises which were originally owned by Dewan Bishan Das who
was a former Prime Minister of the State of Jammu &amp; Kashmir.
He  had constructed several buildings and structures on	 the
disputed  property which was situated in Magharmal  Bagh  in
Srinagar.  The respondents Haji Abdul Aziz Shah and his wife
Abdul  Salem  Shah and Haji Mohammed Ramzan  Shah  purchased
rights in 8 Kanals 9 Marlas and 10,000 sq. feet of the	area
bearing Khasra Nos. 885 and 890 by two sale deeds which were
got registered in July 1967.  Respondent Haji Wali  Mohammed
purchased rights in the land measuring 25,704 sq. feet along
with  buildings and garages situated in Sarai Pain near	 the
Exhibition  Grounds.   According  to  the  respondents	they
started 'their own business establishments in the properties
which  had  been purchased.  It may be	mentioned  that	 the
properties  had been sold by Purmesh Chander and others	 who
were heirs
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">			    803</span>
of Dewan Bishan Das to the respondents.	 For the purpose  of
more  detailed facts we may refer to the petition  filed  by
the  respondent Haji Wali Mohammed.  It was alleged  therein
that  in the month of December 1967 municipal  buildings  in
Hari   Singh  High  Street,  Srinagar  caught	fire.	 The
Municipality  cleared the debris and took possession of	 the
lands  which  became  vacant as a result  of  the  buildings
having been destroyed by the fire.  It was alleged that	 the
Deputy	 Commissioner  who  was	 also  the  Estate   Officer
purported  to issue certain notices in terms of	 the  provi-
sions  of the Land Grants Act 1960 and the Jammu  &amp;  <a href="/doc/1506082/" id="a_9">Kashmir
Public	Premises (Eviction of (Unauthorised  Occupants)	 Act</a>
1959.  These notices, however, were never served on the writ
petitioners.  Para 9 of the petition was as follows
	      "That   petitioner  is  not  liable   to	 any
	      proceedings   under  any	provision   of	 the
	      aforementioned   laws.   That  matter   being,
	      however,	before	the Estate Officer  will  be
	      dealt with in terms of law".
</p><p id="p_7">It  was	 further  alleged  that	 on  January  9,  1968	 the
Administrator  of  the Srinagar Municipality  got  a  notice
affixed	  near	the  petitioner's  property.   This   notice
purported  to  have been issued in terms of s.	129  of	 the
Municipal  Act	of Samvat 2008.	 The said notice  was  never
served upon the petitioner according to law.  Only 24 hours'
notice was given for dismantling the huge structures on	 the
petitioners' land.  This was followed by a very large number
of  police personnel and municipal employees coming  to	 the
property   of  the  petitioner	on  January  11,  1968	 who
demolished  the	 properties  of the  petitioner.   Even	 the
movable properties like iron pipes, timber and fixtures were
either	damaged	 or removed.  The  Administrator  also	took
illegal possession of the petitioner's property without	 any
authority of law.  It was prayed that a writ or direction be
issued to the Administrator of the Municipality	 prohibiting
him  from  interfering with the physical possession  of	 the
petitioner  and	 commanding  him  to  forbear  from   taking
possession  of the property without authority of  law.	 The
notice	issued under the signature of the  Administrator  of
the Municipality which was annexure B to the petition was as
follows :-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">	      "Whereas	your one storeyed garage  without  a
	      roof  situate  at	 Bagh  Magharmal  is  in   a
	      dilapidated condition and there is a danger of
	      an  accident u/s 129 of the Municipal  Act  of
	      2008,  therefore,	 you  are  hereby   informed
	      through this notice of twenty four hours under
	      the   said  section  to  dismantle  the	said
	      structure within the said period.	 In case  of
	      non-compliance the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">	      804</span>
	      Municipality  will get it	 demolished  through
	      its  employees  and will recover	the  charges
	      thereof from you".
</blockquote><p id="p_8">A letter as well as a telegram were sent by the Advocate  of
Haji   Wali  Mohammed.	on  10th  and  12th   January	1968
respectively  to the Administrator calling upon	 him,  inter
alia  to  stop	all  illegal action  of	 demolition  of	 the
building as also the structures on the property of Haji Wali
Mohammed.   It	was  also pointed out  that  property  worth
several lakhs had been damaged or destroyed.
By  means  of a petition dated February 18, 1968  Haji	Wali
Mohammed sought to introduce some additional grounds in	 the
writ petition.	These were :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">	      (a)   "That the proceedings taken against	 the
	      petitioner by respondent No. 2 under  sections
	      4	 and 5 of the Public Premises  Eviction	 Act
	      are ultra vires the Constitution and violating
	      fundamental rights and liable to be quashed.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">	      (b)   That <a href="/doc/1377383/" id="a_10">Sections 4</a> and <a href="/doc/27902/" id="a_11">5</a> of the Act violate
	      <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_12">Article 14</a> of the Constitution of India".
</blockquote><p id="p_9">An  additional prayer was introduced to the effect that	 the
writ  be issued against the Estate Officer and the State  of
Jammu  &amp;  Kashmir  quashing  proceedings  under	 the  Public
Premises Eviction Act pending before the Executive Officer.
The  respondents  filed preliminary objections to  the	writ
petition  saying that the Public Premises Eviction  Act	 had
been  held  to	be intra vires and  that  the  petition	 was
misconceived  and because other efficacious remedies by	 way
of  appeal and suit were available the writ petition  should
be  dismissed.	The Executive Officer filed a  return  dated
June 7, 1968 denying most of the averments contained in	 the
writ petition and it was not denied that the notice had been
issued	under s. 5 of the Public Premises Eviction Act.	  It
was,  however,	claimed	 that  the same	 had  been  done  in
accordance with law.  It was denied that the petitioner Haji
Wali  Mohammed	had  any locus standi  to  file	 a  petition
because the transaction by means of which he claimed to have
acquired  the rights was null and void.	  The  Administrator
also  filed a reply in which he maintained that	 the  Estate
Officer was within his rights in the proceedings taken under
the  Public  Premises Eviction Act as also  under  the	Land
Grants Act 1960.  As regards the notice issued under s.	 129
of the Municipal Act it was stated that its service had	 not
been  accepted by the petitioner and therefore the same	 had
to  be served under the provisions of the Municipal  Act  by
fixing	it on the premises.  Paragraphs 12, 3 and 14 may  be
reproduced
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">805</span>
	      "12.  That the contents of the para are denied
	      as  incorrect.  The dilapidated  condition  of
	      the structure was rendered more dangerous	 due
	      to the heavy snowfall and as such the life  of
	      the   inhabitants	 of  the  locality  was	  in
	      imminent	danger	and as such a  notice  under
	      section  129 Municipal Act 2008  Srinagar	 was
	      warranted	 by the conditions obtained at	that
	      time and the same was done bona fide.
</p><p id="p_10">	      13.   That  the  respondent has  no  knowledge
	      about it.	 That the contents of this para	 are
	      partly admitted inasmuch as the structure	 was
	      already  removed as its dilapidated  condition
	      was a positive threat to the life and property
	      of  the locality and the passers by.  And	 due
	      to  heavy snow fall the structure was  further
	      damaged and in order to ward off any threat to
	      life  and property to the inhabitants  of	 the
	      locality	the petitioner and to the public  in
	      general.	 The notice was served and  received
	      by the Respondent No.  after the structure was
	      demolished.
</p><p id="p_11">	      14.   The	 contents  of the para	are  denied.
</p><p id="p_12">	      The  petitioner  failed  to  comply  with	 the
	      notice under section 129 of Municipal Act 2008
	      and  the respondent in exercise of the  powers
	      conferred on him under the Act, after  getting
	      fully  convinced by the technical	 and  expert
	      opinion  to  avert danger to  human  life	 and
	      property, demolished the structure".
</p><p id="p_13">It  was firmly claimed that the dilapidated house  had	been
demolished under s. 129 of the Municipal Act.
We  have referred to the pleas in one of the writ  petitions
and  the  returns etc. filed on behalf of  the,	 respondents
before the High Court in some detail because one of the main
grievances  of Dr. Singhvi, who appeared for the  appellants
in  this Court, relates to the High Court having  gone	into
and  decided  certain  points which did	 not  arise  on	 the
pleadings.  The High Court in its judgment referred to	some
admitted facts which had been concluded from the  unrebutted
assertions  made  by  the  petitioner  and  also  from	 the
government file No. 561 produced by the Additional  Advocate
General.   It  referred firstly to the law under  which	 the
land,  which  according to the State, had  been	 granted  to
Dewan  Bishan  Das  on what is called  Wasidari	 tenure	 was
substantially  a lease-hold tenure.  The possession  of	 the
land could be resumed by the State on certain conditions one
of which was that the compensation was to be assessed by the
Government in accordance with paragraph 21 of the rules	 for
grant of land in Jammu &amp; Kashmir State for building purposes
and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">806</span>
the compensation was to be paid to the lessee.	On September
22,  1957  the	Government decided to resume  the  lands  in
question  as they were required for constructing  the  tonga
and lorry stands.  Certain orders were passed later by which
the  lands  sought to be resumed were to be  transferred  in
favour	of the Road and Building Department  for  government
purposes.   The orders were made that the possession was  to
be taken only on payment of compensation.
The  compensation,  according to the High Court,  was  ulti-
mately	fixed at Rs. 1,39,260/-.  After certain notices	 had
been  served regarding fresh assessment of valuation by	 the
Divisional  Engineer the lessees filed appeals to the  Chief
Engineer.  Those appeals were filed by the  predecessors-in-
interest  of  the respondent, namely,  Purnesh	Chander	 and
others.	  The appeals were dismissed.  It was found  by	 the
High Court that while the correspondence between the  Deputy
Commissioner  and certain government  departments  concerned
was  still continuing for payment of compensation  composite
notices under ss. 4 &amp; 5 of the Public Premises Eviction	 Act
were served on the tenants on June 18, 1963.  Thereafter the
matter was completely dropped and no steps either to pay the
compensation  to  the lessees or to acquire the land  or  to
continue  the valuation proceedings under the aforesaid	 Act
were  taken.   It is mentioned in the judgment of  the	High
Court  that  no	 reasonable explanation	 was  given  by	 the
Additional  Advocate  General, for this silence for  a	long
time  on  the part of the government or its  officers.	 The
inference   which  the	High  Court  drew  from	 this	long
unexplained  silence  was  that	 the  government  on  second
thoughts did not want to pursue the matter.
On  January 5, 1968 order of eviction was passed  under	 the
Premises   Eviction  Act.   The	 High  Court   noticed	 the
allegation of the parties with regard to the service of	 the
notice as also the case of the petitioner that although	 the
notice was dated January 8, 1968 it was ante-dated the	date
shown being January 5, 1968.  That was the day on which	 the
devastating  fire broke out in the municipal building  which
was  adjacent to the building in dispute and by which  large
portion	 of the municipal building was burnt down to  ashes.
The  case of the writ petitioners before the High Court	 was
that  since  lands had been resumed by	the  Government	 for
purposes of building flats for the municipality, the munici-
pality	thought	 it  a fit occasion to	grab  the  adjoining
lands.	  Since	  its	own  buildings	 were	gutted	 the
Administrator  of the Municipality acting in collusion	with
the  Estate Officer got a notice issued to  the	 petitioners
under  ss.  4  &amp;  5  of	 the  Premises	Eviction  Act.	 The
Administrator, also issued a notice on January 9, 1968 under
s. 129 of the Municipal Act, giving only 24 hours'
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">807</span>
notice	for  demolishing  the building	if  there  was	non-
compliance  with  the order.  A number of  contentions	were
advanced  on behalf of the writ petitioners before the	High
Court  with regard to the validity of the proceedings  under
ss.  4	&amp; 5 of the Premises Eviction  Act.   The  Additional
Advocate  General relied on the validating  legislation	 but
the High Court, after referring to certain decisions of this
Court took the view that<a href="/doc/27902/" id="a_13"> s. 5</a> was ultra vires and could	 not
be  revived by the validating or amending  legislation.	  It
was observed that the only alternative for the State was  to
take  fresh  proceedings under the amended Act	against	 the
petitioners.
</p><p id="p_14">As  regards  the notice issued by the Administrator  of	 the
Municipality  under  s. 129 of the Municipal  Act  the	High
Court expressed the view that there had been  interpolations
in  the notices issued on the various dates to	the  tenants
nor had the notices been properly served as required by	 the
provisions  of the Municipal Act.  Furthermore the haste  in
which  the  notices  had  been	issued	and  the   buildings
demolished  raise  "a  cloud of dust on the  nature  of	 the
proceedings taken by the Administrator".  It was  emphasised
that the notice issued by the Municipality did not  "specify
the nature of the portion of the building which is dangerous
nor  does  it  give sufficient time to	the  petitioners  to
repair	the  buildings	or to  make  representation  to	 the
Administrator".	  The  High  Court considered  that  it	 was
manifestly  clear  that	 the  Deputy  Commissioner  and	 the
Administrator of the Municipality had entered into an unholy
alliance  in order to forcibly and illegally  disposses	 the
petitioners  of	 their property at a time  when	 the  entire
valley	was  in the grip of heavy snowfall  and	 roads	were
completely  blocked  and the government and the	 High  Court
were functioning at Jammu.  The following circumstances	 and
reasons were set out for arriving at that conclusion :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_4">	      (1)   "That  the petitioners and	before	them
	      their predecessors in interest were in  lawful
	      possession  of the premises in dispute  for  a
	      long time.</blockquote>
<p id="p_15">	      (2)   That although the lands were ordered  to
	      be  resumed,  the	 petitioners  could  not  be
	      evicted  until  due compensation was  paid  to
	      them  and	 the Dy.  Commissioner	had  himself
	      clearly adverted to this legal position in his
			    letters   to   various  authorities
and   had
	      requested the Govt. for making funds available
	      for payment of compensation to the lessees.
	      (3)   That  at  the  time	 when  notice  under
	      <a href="/doc/1377383/" id="a_14">section 4</a> and an order under <a href="/doc/27902/" id="a_15">section 5</a> of	 the
	      old  Act were issued, the compensation  though
	      assessed under the new Rules and not under the
	      old
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">	      808</span>
	      Rules  which applied to the present  case	 was
	      neither offered nor paid to the petitioners.
	      (4)   That after issuing notice under  <a href="/doc/1377383/" id="a_16">section
	      4</a>	 some time in 1963, no	further	 proceedings
	      were  taken for about five years and  suddenly
	      an order under<a href="/doc/27902/" id="a_17"> s.	   5</a> was issued on 8-1-1968.</p>
<p id="p_16">	      (5)   That  the  notice under S.	129  of	 the
	      Municipal	   Act	 bore	clear	 marks	  of
	      interpolation  and was not in accordance	with
	      s. 129 of the Municipal Act.
</p><p id="p_17">	      (6)   That  even	the  report  of	 the  Asstt.
</p><p id="p_18">	      Municipal	 Engineer on the basis of which	 the
	      demolition was ordered merely showed that	 the
	      shed  was in a dangerous condition and it	 did
	      not  at  all refer to the buildings  being  in
	      such  a  dangerous  condition  so	 as  to	  be
	      demolished.
</p><p id="p_19">	      (7)   That a major portion of the premises  in
	      dispute were Demolished  on 1-2-1968 and	soon
	      thereafter    these   very    premises	were
	      transferred   to	 the   Municipality    by-an
	      executive	 order of the D.C. without  sanction
	      of the Government".
</p><p id="p_20">The petitions were allowed and writs of certiorari  quashing
the  order  of	eviction made against  the  petitioners	 and
restraining the respondents from evicting them except in due
course	of  law were issued.  Writs of	Mandamus  were	also
issued	directing the respondents to restore  possession  to
the  petitioners  immediately of the properties	 from  which
they had been dispossessed.
</p><p id="p_21">Apart  from the grievance mentioned before on which a  great
deal  of  stress has been laid by Dr. Singhvi  it  has	been
strenuously urged that the High Court has gone into  matters
which  were  not  germane or relevant  and  had	 taken	into
consideration material which was not on the record by making
use  of	 a file which had been produced	 by  the  Additional
Advocate  General  with regard to which no  opportunity	 was
given  to either explain or rebut the inferences which	were
drawn  from  the documents and correspondence  contained  in
that file.  It is pointed out that in view of the  pleadings
there was no justification for going into the various points
on which the High Court rested its judgment.
We consider it wholly unnecessary to determine the  correct-
ness  or  otherwise of all the findings given  by  the	High
Court,	particularly, the conclusion relating  to  collusion
between	 the various government officers  for  dispossessing
the   respondents  before  us  from  their  properties	 and
demolishing  them and the mala fide nature of their  action.
It is common ground that the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">809</span>
validity  of the provisions of the Premises.   <a href="/doc/463150/" id="a_18">Eviction	 Act</a>
which  were struck down by the High Court can no  longer  be
impugned in view of the decision of this Court in <a href="/doc/215754/" id="a_19">Hari Singh
&amp; Others v. The Military Estate Officer &amp; Another</a>(1) and the
connected  appeal.  The question relating to the  resumption
of  all the properties in dispute by the government  on	 the
ground	that  they were Wasidari lands Was  again  a  matter
which  had  not	 been  raised  with  any  precision  in	 the
pleadings  of the parties and it was wholly unnecessary	 for
the  High  Court to have gone into that question.  for	that
reason	and  without relevant documents having been  made  a
part  of the record.  In our judgment the writs	 and  orders
issued by the High Court must be sustained on the  principal
ground	which was taken up in the, writ petitions and  which
related	 to  the action taken by the  Administrator  of	 the
Municipality  after issuing the notices under s. 129 of	 the
Municipal Act.	<a href="/doc/1506082/" id="a_20">Section 129</a> is in the following terms :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_5">	      "Should  any  building, wall or  structure  or
	      anything affixed thereto, or any bank, or tree
	      be  deemed by the Executive Officer to  be  in
	      ruinous state or in any way dangerous or there
	      be  any  fallen building or  debris  or  other
	      material which is unsightly or is likely to be
	      in  any  way injurious to health,	 it  may  by
	      notice  require  the owner thereof  either  to
	      remove the same or to cause such repair to  be
	      made to the building, wall, structure or	bank
	      as   the	 Executive  Officer   may   consider
	      necessary for the public safety and should  it
	      appear  to  be necessary in order	 to  prevent
	      imminent	danger, the Executive Officer  shall
	      forthwith	 take such steps of the	 expense  of
	      the  owner  to  avert the	 danger	 as  may  be
	      necessary".
</blockquote><p id="p_22"><a href="/doc/1506082/" id="a_21">Section 238</a> provides that when any notice under the said Act
requires  any act to be done for which no time is  fixed  by
the  Act  a  reasonable time for doing	the  same  shall  be
specified  in the notice.  <a href="/doc/1506082/" id="a_22">Section 239</a> gives  the  procedure
relating to authentication of service of a valid notice.  It
is  provided  by sub-s. (1) that every such  notice  may  be
served in the manner provided for the service of summons  in
the  Civil Procedure Code so far as may be applicable.	 The
High  Court found that the notice under<a href="/doc/1506082/" id="a_23"> s. 129</a> had not	been
served	in accordance with law and no proof was	 adduced  by
way  of	 an  affidavit of the process server  or  any  other
officer	 of  the Municipality that any attempt was  made  to
serve the notices on the petitioners personally.
It  cannot  be	and indeed it has  not	been  disputed	that
notices	 were  not served in accordance with  the  procedure
prescribed  for	 service of summons in the  Civil  Procedure
Code.  Even if we
(1)-(Civil Appeal No. 493 of 1967) decided on 3.5.1972.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">810</span>
<p id="p_23">accept	what Dr. Singhvi says that there was a	refusal	 to,
accept	the  summons and that was the reason  for  effecting
service	 by  affixation the provisions of O.5, R.19  of	 the
Code were not complied with by the filing of an affidavit of
the  serving officer etc.  All that has been pointed out  by
Dr. Singhvi is that the notices were produced along with the
writ  petitions which showed that they had been	 affixed  to
the premises and that in' the writ petitions it was admitted
that  notices  had been affixed on January 9,  1968  on	 the
properties of the petitioners.	We do not consider that	 any
such   averment	 dispensed  with  the  requirement  of	 the
statutory provision contained in S. 239 of the Municipal Act
in the matter of service of notices.
</p><p id="p_24">Furthermore  we entirely fail to see how the requirement  of
S. 238 of the Municipal Act was satisfied.  <a href="/doc/1506082/" id="a_24">Section 129</a> does
not  specify or fix any time for complying with	 the  notice
issued under that section.  Under the provisions of<a href="/doc/1506082/" id="a_25"> S.	238</a>,
therefore, a reasonable time for doing the acts required  to
be  done by the notice was to be fixed.	 Taking	 the  notice
issued	to Haji Wali Mohammed only 24 hours' time was  given
for  dismantling the structure which was stated to be  in  a
dilapidated  condition.	 It is extraordinary- that  no	time
was  given  for	 repairing the structure and  the  owner  or
occupier  of  the  property was	 required  to  straight	 way
demolish  the building or the structure.  <a href="/doc/1506082/" id="a_26">Section  129</a>	does
contemplate that the owner may be required either to  remove
the structure which is considered dangerous or to cause such
repairs to be made to it as may be considered necessary	 for
public	safety.	 According to all the petitioners they	were
carrying  on their business in the buildings and  structures
which  were  ordered  to be demolished.	  In  the  month  of
January there is usually a snowfall in the Kashmir valley as
has been pointed out by the High Court.	 Considering that at
no  previous  stage  the officers of  the  Municipality	 had
formed	an opinion that the structures in question  were  in
such a dangerous condition or were so dilapidated that	they
should	be demolished the notices which were given  and	 the
drastic step of demolition which was desired to be taken  in
24  hours on the face of it appeared to be rather harsh	 and
unusual.   The	time  of  24  hours  which  was	 given	 for
demolition  was	 so  short that in spite  of  Dr.  Singhvi's
arguments  we have not been persuaded to hold that it was  a
reasonable   time.   The  petitioners  had  to	 make	some
arrangements  for removal of either their goods or  business
equipment  or  whatever articles that were  lying  in  these
buildings  or structures.  We have no manner of	 doubt	that
the  notices  issued to the respondents before	us  did	 not
comply	with the provisions of s. 238 of the  Municipal	 Act
and the time which was granted was so short that it was	 not
possible  for  the  respondents either to  comply  with	 the
notices or to take any
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">811</span>
effective,  steps  in  the matter of filing  any  appeal  or
revision to the appropriate authorities.
Owing  to the non-compliance with the provisions of ss.	 239
and 238 of the Municipal Act the action taken by the Munici-
pality	in  the	 matter of demolition must  be	held  to  be
entirely  illegal and contrary to law.	The conclusions	 and
observations of the High Court on all the points which	have
not  been  decided by us become unnecessary in the  view  we
have  taken with regard to the illegality and invalidity  of
the  demolition carried out pursuant to the  notices  issued
under S. 129 of the Municipal Act.  The observations made by
the  High Court or the conclusions reached by it on all	 the
other	points	would  naturally  not  be  binding  in	 any
proceedings  which  may be initiated or taken  or  continued
either by the present respondents or by the appellants under
the  law.   However, we uphold the orders made by  the	High
Court and dismiss the appeals with costs.  One hearing fee.
