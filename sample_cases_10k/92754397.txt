</p>
<p id="p_5">	5.	Following the same, without expressing any opinion on the merits of the claim made by the petitioner, the 2nd and 3rd respondents are directed to consider the claim of compassionate appointment to any suitable post based on the petitioner eligibility on merits and also in accordance with law and also considering the dictum made in W.P.No.40743 of 2015 dated 13.05.2016, within a period of six weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of this Order.
