                   SUIT FOR PERMANENT INJUNCTION

J U D G M E N T :
</pre>

<p id="p_1">  1. The plaintiff has filed the present suit for permanent injunction against the

     defendant   for   restraining   him,   his   associates,   agents   etc.   from   raising   any

     construction   over   the   suit   property   situated   in   and   comprising   of   Khasra

     no.443/1, Village, Mandawali, Fazalpur, Delhi as shown in red colour in the

     site plan and also from handing over the possession of the same to any other

     person.
</p>
<p id="p_2">  2. The facts of the case are that the plaintiff alongwith his four brothers namely

     Pritam Singh, Bhopal Singh, Ashok Kumar and Mahender Singh are the co­

     owners   of   piece   of   land   measuring   about  1500   sq.   yards  falling  in   Khasra

     no.443/1 alongwith the defendant Kishan Lal.  A copy of Khatoni for the year

     1970­71 was also attached with the plaint in support of the ownership rights of

     the plaintiff.  It has also been stated that as per the revenue records, total land

     of the parties in Khasra no.443/1 was 5 Bigha 17 Biswa but with the passage of

     time, some land was taken over by others and at present, the parties are in

     possession of 1500 sq. yards of land on spot.   The whole  suit property  is in

     joint possession of the parties.  The plaintiff also filed two other suits against

     the defendant and at that time, plaintiff was not in possession of the complete

                                             : 2 of 14 :
</p><p id="p_3">                                                                                   Suit No.285/06

revenue records.   The other two suits were in respect of different claims and

different cause of actions.  The defendant is the real uncle of the plaintiff and

has been looking after the joint property of the parties as the father of the

plaintiff had been missing since 1968 and the plaintiff and his brothers were

not   fully   grown   up.     In   1988,   the   plaintiff   and   his   brothers   alongwith   the

defendant constructed six shops in the suit land and the expenses were borne

by   the  parties   equally   and the shops  are thus  joint  property of  the parties.

While constructing the shops, it was agreed that property would remain joint

and the shops will not be sold out without the consents of the parties and sale

proceeds will be decided in accordance with the ratio of share of the parties.

The defendant alongwith his son Prem Singh wanted to grab the joint property

and misused the same and sell it in illegal manner.  The plaintiff filed the suit

against the defendant and his son and the said suit is still pending in the civil

court.  It has also been stated that besides the constructed portion, rest of the

suit property  is a vacant land and now the defendant has connived with one

Sikh gentleman, who name plaintiff was not able to ascertain, and wants to

raise construction over the open space and handed over to him with the sole

purpose of depriving the plaintiff and his brothers from their valuable rights.

Defendant is being helped by his sons and grand sons in this illegal act.  The

defendant threatened to raise illegal construction and hand over the same to

Sikh gentleman and stacked 8000 bricks and Badarpur on the  suit property.

On 9.12.1995, plaintiff asked the defendant not to raise any construction but the


                                          : 3 of 14 :
</p><p id="p_4">                                                                                Suit No.285/06

   defendant asserted that he will raise the construction and also hand over the

   same to the Sikh gentleman and in case, the plaintiff raises hue and cry, he will

   meet with dire consequences.   The plaintiff approached the local police and

   filed the complaint but to no avail.  Finding no other alternative, the plaintiff

   filed the present suit. 
</p>
<p id="p_5">3. Summons of the suit were served on the defendant.  Defendant appeared in the

   court and did not file the WS despite opportunities being given and thereafter,

   stopped   appearing.     The   defendant   was   proceeded   ex   parte   on   23.7.1997.

   thereafter, the defendant expired and on an application moved by the plaintiff

   U/o 22 Rule 4 CPC, LRs of the defendant were impleaded in 24.8.05.  The WS

   was filed by Prem Singh, LR of the defendant.
</p>
<p id="p_6">4. In the WS, preliminary objections have been taken that the plaintiff has already

   filed a suit against defendant no.1 before Hon'ble High Court of Delhi vide suit

   no.680/83 being suit for partition and injunction order was passed vide order

   dated 11.5.1983 and lateron the said suit was dismissed as compromised.  The

   details of the said suit has been concealed by the plaintiff and his brothers and

   have filed several suits against defendant no.1 and defendant no.2 for harassing

   them  as  the  suit  property  in question belongs to  father of the plaintiff and

   defendant   no.1   and   other   sons   of   Sh.   Ram   Chander   was   already   mutually

   partitioned between the forefathers.   It has also been stated that the plaintiff

   has   already   filed  two   suits  regarding the  same property which  are pending

   adjudication claiming the same relief.  One suit no.16/97 was filed by Subhash


                                         : 4 of 14 :
</p><p id="p_7">                                                                                       Suit No.285/06

   Jain and Ors. against the plaintiff and his brothers regarding the property in

   question  for permanent  injunction and said suit  was compromised with Sh.

   Subhash   Jain   &amp;   Ors.   against   consideration   amount   of   Rs.10   lac   and   this

   amount was properly acknowledged in the compromise deed filed  before the

   court and the plaintiff had agreed to withdraw the all suits against Prem Singh

   &amp; Ors.   The plaintiff and his brothers and defendant no.1 Sh. Kishan Lal are

   only holding only 5 Biswa of land.  The property in Khasra no.443/1 or Khasra

   no.443 measuring about 5 Bigha 17 Biswa almost have already been sold out

   by the father of plaintiff and defendant no.1 in 1954 to different purchasers and

   only 5 Biswa are in possession of the parties.  
</p>
<p id="p_8">                On merits, the contents of the plaint have been denied and it has been

   stated that only 5 Biswa of land belongs to parties of the suit and other area

   does not belong to the parties of the suit as it has already been sold out.  The

   defendant also filed Khasra Girdawaris for the year 1989 and 1990 and 1986­

</p><p id="p_9">   87. It was also submitted that plaintiff has no right in the suit property and the

   suit is not maintainable.  Joint possession of the plaintiff has also been denied

   and   it   has   been   stated   that   the  suit   property  is   in   possession   of   respective

   purchasers of the same.   All other allegations made in the plaint have been

   denied and a prayer has been made for dismissal of the suit with costs.  

</p><p id="p_10">5. The plaintiff filed replication denying the contents of the WS in so far as they

   were   contrary   to   the   plaint.     The   contents   of   plaint   were   reiterated   and

   reaffirmed.

</p><p id="p_14">6. On 22.05.2009, following issues were framed :
</p>
<p id="p_15">   1) Whether the plaintiff is guilty of concealment of material facts and has not

   come to the court with clean hands? OPD

</p><p id="p_16">   2) Whether the parties to the suit are only the owners of 5 Biswas in Khasra

   no.443/A/1, Village Mandawali, Fazalpur, Delhi? OPD

   prayed for? OPP

<p id="p_19">7. In support of his case, the plaintiff has examined himself as  PW­1  and has

   tendered his examination in chief by way of affidavit  Ex.PW­1/A.   He also

   proved on record the site plan as Ex.PW­1/1 and photocopy of khatauni for the

   year 1970­71 as  Mark A  and copy of complaint dated 9.12.1995 as  Mark B

   and closed his evidence.

</p>
<p id="p_22">9. I have heard Ld. Counsel for the plaintiff and Ld. Counsel for the defendants

   and   have   perused   the   record   carefully.       My  findings   on   the   issues   are   as

   under :­

   ISSUE NO.2 :
</p>
<p id="p_23">   Whether the parties to the suit are only the owners of 5 Biswas in Khasra

   no.443/A/1, Village Mandawali, Fazalpur, Delhi? OPD

</p><p id="p_24">10.The onus of proving this issue was on the defendant.  The plaintiff in his plaint

   claimed   that   plaintiff   alongwith   his   four   brothers   is   co­owner   of   land

   measuring   about   1500   sq.   yards   in   Khasra   no.443/1,   Village   Mandawali,

   Fazalpur, Delhi alongwith defendant Kishan Lal.   It  was further stated that

   according   to   the   revenue   records,   the   total   land   of   the   parties   in   khasra

   no.443/1 is 5 bighas and 17 biswas but some land has been taken by others and

   the parties are now in possession of about 1500 sq. yards. 

</p><p id="p_25">11. The defendant in his WS denied the claim of the plaintiff and submitted that

   the parties are in possession of only 5 biswas of land in khasra no.443/1 and

   the other area mentioned as 1500 sq. yards does not belong to the parties in

   suit as the same had already been sold out earlier by the father of the plaintiff

   and Kishan Lal.  Copies of the khasra girdawari for the year 1986 to 1990 also

   mentioned regarding the area as 5 Biswas only.  DW­1 Prem Singh in his cross


                                            : 7 of 14 :
</p><p id="p_26">                                                                                 Suit No.285/06

examination   has   reiterated   this   fact   and   has   placed   on   record   the   khatauni

pertaining to Khasra no.443/1 pertaining to the year 1986­87 as Mark C which

shows  the area of  the plot  to be 5 Biswas only.   The plaintiff in his cross

examination   has   also   admitted   that   the   government   had   acquired   the   land

except 5 Biswas but he had not received compensation from the government

for the   acquired  land   and  the  said  land  was  lateron  released. However,  the

plaintiff   has   not   filed   on   record   any  document  /  notification  issued   by   the

government vide which the land acquired by the government was released.  In

the absence of any such document being placed on record by the plaintiff, it

cannot be said that the parties are in possession of more than 5 biswas of land.

The plaintiff has relied upon the copy of khatauni for the year 1970­71 Mark A

which shows the land to be 5 bighas and 17 biswas.  However, in view of the

latest  records  filed   by  the defendant, i.e. the khatauni  Mark C for the year

1986­87 showing the area of the land to be 5 biswas, it can be safely held that

the contention of the plaintiff that the parties are in possession of 1500 sq.

yards of land is apparently false.  It is surprising as to why the plaintiff has not

made any representation for correction of the land shown in khatauni Mark C

for the year 1986­87 which shows that the area of land is only 5 Biswas if the

actual measurement of the land in possession of the parties was 1500 sq. yards.

The conduct of the plaintiff belies the conduct of a prudent person and no

reliance can be placed on the statement of the plaintiff that the parties are in

   of the defendants and against the plaintiff.

<p id="p_29">   Whether the plaintiff is guilty of concealment of material facts and has not

   come to the court with clean hands? OPD

</p><p id="p_30">12.The   onus   of   proving   this   issue   was   on   the   defendant.    Counsel   for   the

   defendant has argued that defendant has not come to the court with clean hands

   and is guilty of suppression of material facts.  It has been submitted that the

   plaintiff   filed   another   suit   on   the   same   cause   of   action   which   is   pending

   adjudication before the court of Sh. Ajay Gupta, the then Addl. Sr. Civil Judge,

   (East Distt) and  this fact was deliberately suppressed by the plaintiff.   The

   plaintiff   has   also   concealed   the   material   fact   of   filing   of   suit   for   partition

   before Hon'ble High Court of Delhi and the withdrawal of the said suit.  It has

   also been argued that the plaintiff has also concealed the filing of the suit by

   Subhash Jain against the plaintiff and his brothers bearing suit no.16/97 and

   the settlement arrived therein.
</p>
<p id="p_31">13.In order to substantiate his claim, the DW­1 Prem Singh has proved on record

   the photocopy of the suit no.16/97 titled as Subhash Jain &amp; Ors. Vs. Rajender

   Singh   &amp;   Ors.   as   Mark  D.   He  has  also  proved  on  record  the  copy  of  suit

   no.680/83 titled as Rajender Singh &amp; Ors. Vs. Kishan Lal &amp; Anr. being suit for

   declaration and partition of joint Hindu family properties as Mark E.

</p><p id="p_32">14.During his cross examination, the plaintiff testified that he has filed the present

suit in respect of land pertaining to khasra no.443/1 measuring 5 bighas and 17

biswas.  He also admitted that the plaint Ex.PW­1/D1 pertains to the suit filed

by him in respect of the same property against the same defendant which is

pending adjudication in the court of Sh. Ajay Gupta.  He further testified that

he had filed the suit for the land measuring 5 biswas in the court of Sh. Ajay

Gupta and volunteered that he had filed the suit for the said piece of land as

documents regarding the remaining land were not traceable at that time. He

also admitted in the cross examination that his four brothers are also co­sharers

in   the   aforesaid  suit   properties   and   he   has   not   obtained   any   attorney   or

authorisation letter from his brothers for filing this suit nor he has impleaded

them as party to the present suit.  He also admitted that a case was filed against

him and his brothers by Subhash Jain &amp; Ors. but denied the suggestion that he

had undertaken to withdraw the present suit also.  He admitted his signatures

as well as signatures of his brothers on the settlement dated 28.6.1997.   He

further admitted that suit no.16/97 also related to khasra no.443/1.   He also

admitted that he had filed a suit for partition before Hon'ble High Court of

Delhi and property situated in khasra no.443/1 was included in that suit.  He

also   admitted   that   he   had   withdrawn   that   suit   but   denied   that   there   was   a

compromise with the defendant.  The plaintiff also admitted that a compromise

application dated 24.9.1986 was moved with the signatures of all the parties

alongwith his affidavit but testified that there was no compromise was effected

between the parties.  He also denied the suggestion that the suit was withdrawn


                                         : 10 of 14 :
</p><p id="p_34">                                                                                      Suit No.285/06

   after complete satisfaction and  division of the properties between the parties

   and   further   denied   that   he   has   received   2000   sq.   yards   of   land   from   the

   defendant Kishan Lal of khasra no.882 under the said compromise. He also

   showed ignorance if his father and defendant Kishan Lal had sold the land out

   of khasra no.443/1 by way of five registered sale deeds.     

</p><p id="p_35">15.Perusal of the cross examination of plaintiff shows that he had admitted the

   filing of the suit before the court of Sh. Ajay Gupta, the plaint of which has

   been   exhibited   as   Ex.PW­1/D1.     Para   3   of   the   said   plaint   shows   that   the

   plaintiff has admitted tat according to the khatauni for the year 1986­87, the

   plaintiff, his brothers and defendant Kishan Lal, there is only 5 biswas of land.

   The said suit was filed by the plaintiff in the year 1990 and the relief claimed

   in the said suit is almost identical to the relief claimed in the present suit.  In

   the said suit, the plaintiff prayed for restraining the defendant from disposing

   off the suit property measuring 1500 sq. yards falling in khasra no.443/1 and

   from restraining the defendants from interfering in joint possession.   In the

   present suit also, the plaintiff has also sought to restrain the defendant from

   raising any construction over the suit property and also from handing over the

   possession of the same to any other person.  
</p>
<p id="p_36">16.The statement of plaintiff in his cross examination that the suit before the court

   of Sh. Ajay  Gupta was only for 5 biswas of land is falsified by the prayer

   clause   in   the   said   suit   wherein   relief   was   claimed   in   respect   of   the   land

   measuring 1500 sq. yards.

</p><p id="p_40">17. The conduct of the plaintiff in not mentioning in the present case about the

   pendency   of   the   said   suit   bearing   no.756/90   (New   No.78/04)   amounts   to

   concealment of material facts. Similarly, non mentioning of the suit filed by

   the plaintiff in the Hon'ble High Court and its result in the present plaint also

   amounts to concealment of material facts as both the suits involved the land

   pertaining to khasra no.443/1.  
</p>
<p id="p_41">18.Even during the pendency of the present case, the plaintiff failed to disclose

   the filing of the suit against him by Subhash Jain &amp; Ors. bearing suit no.16/97

   which again involved the properties situated in khasra no.443/1.   During the

   course   of   arguments,   this   court   specifically   sought   clarifications   from   the

   plaintiff regarding the properties involved in suit no.16/97 whereupon it was

   revealed by the plaintiff that the three shops and the open space on the south

   side of the passage as shown in the site plan Ex.PW­1/1 was sold to Sh. A.K.

   Jain and now only the open space below the shops on the northern side of the

   passage in the site plan Ex.PW­1/1 is the  suit property.   This conduct of the

   plaintiff  again   amounts  to  concealment  of material  facts.   If  there  was any

   subsequent development after the filing of the suit, the plaintiff was under a

   duty to disclose the said developments to the court by moving application for

   amendment in the plaint and the site plan.  However, the silence of the plaintiff

   on all these material developments raises an adverse inference against him.  

</p><p id="p_42">19.Thus, in view of the aforesaid discussion, I am of the considered opinion, the

   defendant has discharged the onus cast on them and from careful perusal of


                                         : 12 of 14 :

   record, it is apparent that the plaintiff is guilty of concealment of material facts

   and has not approached the court with clean hands.  Hence, issue is decided in

   favour of the defendants and against the plaintiff.

   ISSUE NO.3 :
</p>
<p id="p_44">   Whether   the   plaintiff   is   entitled   to   the   relief  of   permanent   injunction   as

   prayed for? OPP

</p><p id="p_45">20.The onus of proving this issue was on the plaintiff.  The plaintiff has claimed

   relief of injunction in respect of the suit property as shown in red colour in the

   site plan Ex.PW­1/1.  However, in his cross examination, plaintiff had admitted

   that the suit property in the present suit and in the suit bearing no.78/04 titled

   as Rajender Singh Vs. Kishan Lal &amp; Anr. exhibited as Ex.PW­1/D1 is the same

   and even the site plan filed by the plaintiff in the said suit is also the same.  In

   his cross examination, he has also testified that he has filed the present suit for

   land   pertaining   to   khasra   no.443/1   measuring   5   bighas   and   17   biswas.

   However, perusal of cross examination of DW­1 recorded on 10.8.10 shows that

   the   plaintiff   had   filed   a   khatauni   of   the   year   1986­87   (Ex.DW­1/P1   which

   shows that area of the land to be 5 biswas. The plaintiff has not produced any

   other document /revenue record pertaining to the periods after the year 1986­

   87 to show that the parties are in possession of land measuring 5 bighas and 17

   biswas in khasra no.443/1.  Although, the plaintiff orally testified that he land

   was acquired by the government but lateron it was released but he failed to

   produce on record any notification issued by the government to show that the

      land was actually released by the government.  
</p>
<p id="p_47">   21. It is well settled principle of law that the relief of injunction is an equitable

      relief and the parties and person must approached the court with clean hands

      and disclosed all the material facts truthfully and fairly in order to become

      entitle for the discretionary relief of injunction.   In view of my findings on

      issue no.1 hereinabove, I am of the considered opinion that the plaintiff has not

      approached the court with clean hands and has suppressed material facts from

      the court.   Hence, the plaintiff is not entitled for the discretionary relief of

      injunction from the court.  
</p>
<p id="p_48">   22.Thus in view of the aforesaid discussion, the plaintiff is not entitled for any

      relief whatsoever. The issue is accordingly decided in favour of the defendants

      and against the plaintiff.
