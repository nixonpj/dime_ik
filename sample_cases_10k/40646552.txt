Present:- Mr. Veneet Sharma, Advocate
          for the petitioners.

</p>
<p id="p_4">VIJENDER SINGH MALIK,J(ORAL)

           Mukhtiar Singh, Parminder Singh, Nishan Singh and

Saba, the petitioners seek pre-arrest bail in a case registered by

way of FIR No. 60 dated 2.5.2012 at Police Station Ajnala,

District Amritsar, for an offence punishable under <a href="/doc/1101188/" id="a_1">sections 379</a>,

<a href="/doc/1947545/" id="a_2">448</a> and <a href="/doc/1185693/" id="a_3">511</a> IPC.
</p>
<p id="p_5">           Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that the

case against the petitioners is that the shop of the complainant

adjoins the flour mill of the petitioners and that the common wall

of the two properties had been broken and theft had been

committed in the shop of the complainant. According to him, the

police has conducted inquiry in the matter and has found the

allegations to be false. He has referred me in this regard to

Annexure A-1. He further submits that the petitioners have

joined the investigation and police has allegedly effected

recoveries. He further submits that the complainant did not have
 Crl. Misc. No.M-15637 of 2012                     =2=


a valid title to the shop and by lodging this FIR, he wanted to

legalize his ownership over the shop in question. He further

submits that the petitioners have now sold the flour mill and

have now no concern either with the shop or the flour mill.

</p><p id="p_6">              Learned State counsel, on the other hand, admits that

the petitioners have joined the investigation and that the

recoveries have already been effected.
</p>
<p id="p_7">            Learned counsel for the complainant, on the other

hand, submits that Nishan Singh, one of the petitioners is involved

in another case. He further submits that a bunch of land grabbers

are operating in that area and the petitioners are some of them.

He further submits that Dalip Singh, father of Nishan Singh is an

influential person, who has influenced the Inquiry report in his

favour.
</p>
<p id="p_8">            The trial court would have to decide as to whether

Inquiry report has been influenced or not. The fact remains that

the petitioners have joined the investigation and recovery stands

effected. The petitioners do not claim any connection with the shop

in question. In these circumstances, without commenting on the

merits of the case, I find the petitioners to be entitled to pre-arrest

bail. Consequently, the petition is allowed and order dated

24.5.2012 granting interim anticipatory bail to the petitioners is

made absolute.
