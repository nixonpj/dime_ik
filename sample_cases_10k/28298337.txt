              (SURESH CHANDRA GUPTA Vs SHRI KRISHNA GAUR)


08-08-2017

       Shri Rajeev Shrivastava, learned counsel for the petitioner.
       Shri Narendra Singh Tomar, learned counsel for the
respondent.</pre>
<p id="p_1">       This criminal revision under <a href="/doc/1457888/" id="a_1">Section 397</a>, <a href="/doc/1571667/" id="a_2">401</a> of Cr.P.C.
has been filed being aggrieved by the order dt.30.08.2014 passed
by the First Additional Sessions Judge, Gohad, District Bhind in
Criminal Revision No.128/2014, by which the order passed by
the SDM, Gohad in case No.2/2013 dt.31.5.2014 has been
reversed.
</p><p id="p_2">       It is petitioner's contention that he had filed an application
under <a href="/doc/983382/" id="a_3">Section 133</a> of the Cr.P.C. before the SDM, Gohad alleging
that the applicant is having his residential house near State Bank
of India, Malanpur, which is about 25 years old and he has dug a
borewell in the said house, which is the only source of drinking
water. It is alleged that respondent-accused, who was residing in
the close proximity has dug one earthen hole near the applicant's
water bore, for construction of toilet and despite request he is not
restraining himself from continuing with the work of construction
of toilet, which will pollute the water bore. In view of such
submission, learned SDM has passed the order dt.31.5.2014
restraining the respondent from continuing with the construction
with further direction to close the said pit and also for removal of
nuisance of welding machine and kharad.
</p><p id="p_3">      Learned counsel for the respondent submits that he has a
two storeyed house and two buildings are separated by a
 permanent boundary wall. He was constructing the toilet as per
the government policy after digging a hole for construction of
septic tank. According to him, septic tank has been dug and once
it is plastered, not a single drop of water would seep from the
septic tank. Therefore, the allegation of the petitioner is just to
harass the non applicant inasmuch as he is not willing to sell his
property in favour of the applicant/complainant.
</p><p id="p_4">       Being aggrieved by the said order passed by the SDM,
criminal revision was filed, which has been allowed by the
learned Additional Sessions Judge on the ground that there is no
case of public nuisance and further the Additional Sessions Judge
has noted that the impugned order was passed by the SDM
merely on the basis of surmises and conjectures inasmuch as R.I.
had only expressed his doubt about pollution which may be
caused in future whereas no opportunity of production of
evidence was allowed to the opposite party nor any opinion of
any specialist was taken as to the fact that whether any pollution
was taking place or not. Even the report of R.I. was not supplied
to the opposite party.
</p><p id="p_5">       Learned counsel for the petitioner has placed reliance on
the judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Balwant
Singh Vs. Commissioner of Police as reported in (2015) 4 SCC
801, in which the facts of the case were different and issue was
pertaining to public nuisance on account of Protests March for
ventilating their grievances close to the house of the petitioner
but in the present case, the petitioner has not made out any of the
ingredients of <a href="/doc/983382/" id="a_4">Section 133</a> of the Cr.P.C. Neither any report was
given nor the inspection had been carried out in presence of the
 opposite party and also looking to the fact that no report of the
expert was called for to confirm the allegation of nuisance from
the toilet, such order could not have been passed by the SDM.
Therefore, the impugned order passed by the Additional Sessions
Judge does not warrant any interference and thus the petition fails
and is dismissed.
