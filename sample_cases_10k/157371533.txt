<p id="p_1">1.         All the above civil revisions are at the instance of the

decree holders challenging the order passed by the Executing Court

dismissing the execution petition filed by the landowners seeking

for enforcement of the awards determining compensation for

acquisition of land by the Union. The acquisition appears to have
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1"> Civil Revision No.1604 of 1999 (O&amp;M)                  -2-</span>

been done under the Requisitioning and Acquisition of Immovable

Property Act of 1952. The decree passed by this Court in FAO

No.427 of 1985, dated 07.05.1986-Atma Singh and others Versus

Punjab State and another, provided for compensation at the rate of

` 16,000/- per acre for chahi/nehri; ` 11,000/- for barani and `

4,000/- as granted by the lower Court for banjar qadim to be

maintained. This judgment of the High Court also provided for a

solatium at the rate of 30% and interest at the rate of 9% per annum

from the date of acquisition till the expiry of one year and thereafter

at the rate of 15% per annum. In other words, the Court provided

for what was permissible under the scheme of the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_1">Land Acquisition

Act</a>. It appears that there had been an appeal at the instance of the

landowners themselves but the same was dismissed and a further

appeal to the Supreme Court also appears to have been dismissed,

affirming the decision already rendered by this Court in the above

FAO No.427 of 1985 and other connected cases.
</p>
<p id="p_2">2.          When these awards were put in execution, the objection

taken by the Union which was accepted by the Court below was that

there was no scope for awarding solatium and interest for

acquisition of property under the Requisitioning and Acquisition of

Immovable Property Act, 1952. The Executing Court further held

that interest cannot be claimed on the solatium. Since some amount

had been paid, the Court had also observed that in the manner of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2"> Civil Revision No.1604 of 1999 (O&amp;M)                   -3-</span>

calculation, the appropriation cannot be made only towards the cost

first, interest next and to the principal next. I find all the lines of

reasoning adopted by the court below are erroneous and would

require to be set aside.
</p>
<p id="p_3">3.          It is a fundamental precept of law that an Executing

Court cannot traverse beyond the judgment of the trial Court as

modified in the appellate forum and it is bound to execute it in

execution in the manner that the award was passed. If the award

provided for interest and solatium, it shall be incompetent for an

Executing Court to decide on the correctness of the judgment of this

Court passed in FAO No.427 of 1985. If the issue of solatium and

interest cannot be reopened, then solatium itself is a component of

compensation for the land and, therefore, interest is leviable on

solatium also. The entire amount of compensation will have to be

treated as one block and interest has to be calculated on the same.

The reasoning adopted that the interest could not be claimed on

solatium, therefore, is not correct.    When a decree provides for

interest and costs and some payments have been made by a

judgment debtor without any specific direction as to appropriation,

the claimants shall be at liberty to appropriate the payments first

towards costs, then towards interest and in the last towards the

principal. The manner of appropriation was also justified. The

claimants shall be entitled to enforce it in the manner it had done.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3"> Civil Revision No.1604 of 1999 (O&amp;M)                  -4-</span>

The claimants are also at liberty to file a fresh memo of calculation

at the Executing Court and seek for a recovery in the manner

admissible in law.
</p>
<p id="p_4">4.           The impugned orders are set aside and the civil revisions

are allowed to the above extent.
