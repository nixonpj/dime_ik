HIGH COURT OF JUDICATURE AT ALLAHABAD
 
 

?Court No. - 83
 

 
Case :- CRIMINAL MISC. BAIL APPLICATION No. - 8259 of 2019
 

 
Applicant :- Sitasharan
 
Opposite Party :- State Of U.P.
 
Counsel for Applicant :- Manvendra Singh
 
Counsel for Opposite Party :- G.A.
 

 
Hon'ble Raj Beer Singh,J.
</pre> 
<p id="p_1">Counter affidavit filed in Court today, is taken on record. 
</p> 
<p id="p_2">Heard learned counsel for the applicant, learned A.G.A. for the State and perused the record.
</p> 
<p id="p_3">The present bail application has been filed by the applicant in case crime No. 179/2018, under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_1">Sections 302</a>, <a href="/doc/9545/" id="a_2">376D</a> IPC &amp; <a href="/doc/200125/" id="a_3">Section 3</a>/<a href="/doc/230360/" id="a_4">4</a> of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012, police station Kokhraj, District Kaushambi with the prayer to enlarge the applicant on bail.
</p> 
<p id="p_4">It has been argued by learned counsel for the applicant that the accused-applicant has been falsely implicated in this case and that investigation has been conducted in a mechanical way and that there is no evidence to show that the applicant has committed murder of the deceased. It was further submitted that the applicant has no motive to commit the murder of the deceased and he has been falsely implicated merely on the basis of suspicion, while he is resident of another village Bhadvan, situated at about four kilometres from village Beesara. The applicant has not gone to meet Vineeta on 29.04.2018; that there was a marriage ceremony in village Beesara on 29.04.2018 and it appears that some unknown persons have sexually assaulted and committed murder of deceased. It was further stated that prosecution version that applicant has given a mobile phone to the deceased, is quite unnatural and the call details record of that mobile phone also belies the prosecution version. There is no eye witness of the alleged incident and that applicant has been falsely implicated merely on the basis of suspicion. It was submitted that the applicant is in judicial custody since 02.05.2018 and in case, applicant is enlarged on bail, the applicant will not misuse the liberty of bail.
</p> 
<p id="p_5">Learned A.G.A. has opposed the prayer for bail and argued that the applicant is named in the FIR and that the deceased was called by the applicant at around 10:00 PM and thereafter, on the next day at about 5:00 AM, dead body of the deceased was found. It was also submitted that deceased has been subjected to gang rape. 
</p> 
<p id="p_6">This case pertains to rape and murder of a young girl, aged about 14 years and as per prosecution version, earlier the talk regarding engagement of the deceased with applicant was going on and that the deceased was called by the applicant and she has gone to meet him at about 10:00 PM and thereafter, her dead body was found on the next day at about 5:00 AM and as per postmortem report, deceased has sustained as many as eight injuries. 
</p> 
<p id="p_7">After considering submissions of learned counsel for the parties, looking into the seriousness of the allegations, gravity of the offence and severity of the punishment and also considering all attending facts and circumstances of the case, no case for grant of bail is made out. 
</p> 
<p id="p_8">Accordingly, the instant bail application is rejected.
</p> 
<p id="p_9">Order Date :- 7.8.2019
 
Anand
