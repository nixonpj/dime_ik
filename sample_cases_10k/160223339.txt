<p id="p_6">     3.       The petitioner contends that respondent No. 1 - Yusuf Faijusab
                             
     Sayyed initiated civil litigation bearing Regular civil Suit No. 26 of 2005 for

     the relief of declaration and injunction against petitioner and others in the
                            
     court of     Civil Judge, Junior Division, Chakur, District Latur. Agricultural

     lands bearing Gut Nos. 181 and 205 located at village             Dapkyal, tahsil
      

     Chakur were the subject-matter of the suit. After receipt of suit summons,

     the petitioner and other defendants appeared in the proceedings and
   



     resisted the claim by filing written statement. Defendants averred in

     written statement that portions of land Gut No. 205 admeasuring 1





     hectare, 08 Aar and Gut No. 181 admeasuring 00 hectare, 92 Aar were

     acquired by the State Government for the purpose of storage tank of

     village Dapkyal, tahsil Chakur. Pending proceedings, original plaintiff i.e.





     respondent No. 1 -Yusuf Faijusab Sayyed, preferred application Exhibit-99

     and requested to allow him to withdraw the suit with liberty to file a fresh

     suit on the same cause of action before the Civil Judge, Senior Division,

     District Latur. Learned trial court kept application awaiting for reply on

     behalf of defendants, but nobody turn up to the court and ultimately

     circumstances compelled learned trial court to allow respondent No. 1 -

     plaintiff to withdraw the suit with liberty to file a fresh suit on the same

     the petitioner.

<p id="p_8">     4.       The learned counsel for petitioner submits that impugned order

     passed by learned trial court is erroneous, illegal and not sustainable




                                                    
     within purview of law. The learned trial court did not pass order after

     hearing the petitioner. There were no formal defects in the proceedings.




</p>                                        
<p id="p_9">     The reasons mentioned in the petition are false and baseless and not
                             
     considerable at all. The original plaintiff - Yusuf Faijusab Sayyed is one of

     the party to the proceeding of Land Acquisition Reference No. 90 of 2007.
</p>                            
<p id="p_10">     He has also filed first appeal in the proceedings. Therefore, he cannot

     claims ignorance of the acquisition of the contentious suit land. The

     petitioner added that after framing requisite issues, plaintiff adduced his
      


     evidence before the learned trial court. The defendants also filed affidavit
   



     by way of evidence. But, there was no cross-examination to the

     defendants on behalf of the plaintiff. Eventually, learned trial court passed

     order of "No-cross" and forfeited the right of plaintiff to cross-examine the





     petitioner in the proceeding. The plaintiff made endeavour to get set-aside

     the order      of "no-cross" but, learned trial court did not respond to the

     request of plaintiff - Yusuf Sayyed and rejected the application. Thereafter,





     plaintiff played mischief and preferred present application Exhibit-99 for

     withdrawal of the suit with liberty to file a fresh suit on same cause of

     action. The permission to withdraw the suit by the plaintiff is at belated

     stage, and against the principles of natural justice. Therefore, petitioner

     rushed to this court by invoking remedy under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_1">Article 227</a> of the

     Constitution of India and filed the present petition to redress her

     grievances.

     plaintiff - Yusuf Faijusab Fayyed filed suit against the petitioner and other

     contentious suit land Gut Nos. 181 and 205 of village Dapkyal, tahsil




                                                         
     Chakur. The petitioner accompanied with other defendants appeared in the

     proceedings and filed written statement. It has been pleaded on behalf of

     petitioner that portions of land gut Nos. 181 and 205 of village Dapkyal,




                                            
     tahsil Chakur were acquired by the Government of Maharashtra for the
                             
     purpose of storage of tank. After adducing the evidence particularly in the

     proceedings, plaintiff preferred application Exhibit-99 seeking permission
                            
     to withdraw the proceeding with liberty to file suit on same cause of

     action. Accordingly, learned trial court appreciated circumstances and
      

     passed impugned order dated 20-10-2012.

     Code, 1908 (for short "CPC") gave power to the court to allow the plaintiff

     at any point of time to withdraw his suit unconditionally or to withdraw





     from the suit on certain conditions. Object of the rule is not to allow the

     plaintiff opportunity to commence trial afresh after he has failed to conduct

     suit with due diligence and care and to substantiate his case by evidence.





     However, very purpose of Order XXIII of the CPC is to prevent defeat of

<p id="p_17">     8.       It is to be noted that petitioner or other defendants did not oppose

     the contention propounded on behalf of the plaintiff in the application

     Exhibit-99 and they all remained absent. Eventually, learned trial court





     considering the grounds propounded in the petition, passed impugned

     order. It is the rule of law that in case a prayer made for liberty to file

     fresh suit, the matter has to be considered on the touchstone of

     requirements of order XXIII, Rule 1 of the CPC. If the court is satisfied, it

     may permit the plaintiff to withdraw the suit with liberty to file fresh suit.

     Government of Maharashtra for storage tank of          village    Dapkyal, tahsil

     against defendants pertains to the land Gut Nos. 181 and 205. It is




                                                      
     brought to the notice that there was acquisition of portion of contentious

     suit land Gut Nos. 181 and 205 of village Dapkyal, tahsil Chakur by the




                                                     
     Government of Maharashtra for the storage of tank. Therefore, the Court

     below allowed application(Exhibit-99) to give reasonable opportunity to the

     plaintiff to implead the State of Maharashtra as necessary party in the




                                         
     proceeding. Undisputably, the suit against the Government Authority is
                             
     required to be instituted before the court of Civil Judge, Senior Division

     and the learned trial court appreciated the grounds mentioned in the
                            
     application being sufficient to allow the plaintiff to institute a fresh suit on

     the subject-matter involved in the proceedings. The possibility of failure of
      

     the plaintiff in the proceedings on technical issue of not impleading

     Government authority as necessary party in the proceeding could not be
   



     ruled out. Therefore, learned trial court in the interest of justice allowed

     the plaintiff for withdrawal of the suit with liberty to file fresh suit on the





     same cause action. The approach of learned trial court while dealing with

     the application (Exhibit-99) appears just, proper and reasonable. There is

     no error committed on the part of the learned trial court while allowing





     application for withdrawal of the proceeding with liberty to file a fresh suit

     on the same cause of action.
