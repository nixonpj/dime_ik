:ORDER  
</pre>
<p id="p_1">                This petition has been filed seeking to quash the First
Information Report registered in Crime No.64 of 2017 pending on the file of
first respondent.
</p><p id="p_2">                2.On the complaint lodged by the second respondent herein, the
first respondent police has registered a case in Crime No.64 of 2017 for the
offence under <a href="/doc/1258372/" id="a_2">Sections 147</a>, <a href="/doc/763672/" id="a_3">148</a>, <a href="/doc/222396/" id="a_4">427</a>, <a href="/doc/1947545/" id="a_5">448</a>, <a href="/doc/1198799/" id="a_6">294(b)</a>, <a href="/doc/1011035/" id="a_7">323</a>, <a href="/doc/724142/" id="a_8">324</a> and <a href="/doc/180217/" id="a_9">506(ii)</a> IPC
and 4 of the Tamil Nadu Prohibition of Harassment of Woman Act, 2002 against 
the petitioners/accused Nos.1 to 13 and in order to quash the same, the
petitioners are before this Court by filing the present petition, on the
ground that both the parties have arrived at a compromise.
</p>
<p id="p_3">                3.Today, when the matter was taken up for hearing,
Mr.Meenakshinathan, the Sub Inspector of Police, Ottapidaram Police Station,
Thoothukudi District is present. The defacto complainant and the petitioners
are present and their identifications were also verified by this Court, in
addition to the confirmation of the identity of the parties by the learned
Additional Public Prosecutor through Mr.Meenakshinathan, the Sub Inspector of
Police, Ottapidaram Police Station, Thoothukudi District. Learned counsel
appearing for the parties also endorsed the identify of their respective
parties.
</p><p id="p_4">                4.The learned counsel appearing for the petitioners filed this
quash petition along with a joint memo of compromise on 07.06.2018, wherein,
it is stated as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_5">        "2.It is submitted that the petitioners and 2nd respondent are same
community peoples and same village. Pending investigation of the above
criminal case, due to the intervention of the village elders, the petitioners
and 2nd respondent had entered into compromise and both had settle their
dispute amicably. Moreover, the 2nd respondent given a letter to withdraw his
complaint which lodged against the petitioners before the 1st respondent
police. Therefore, the 2nd respondent did not want to proceed further the
above criminal case pending investigation against the petitioner. The 2nd
respondent hereby accept for quashing the FIR in Crime No.64 of 2017 on the
file of the 1st respondent police, Thoothukudi.?
</p>
<p id="p_6">                5.When such a situation arose in similarly placed matters in
Crl.O.P.(MD) Nos.406, 530 and 864 of 2016 (Prabu and others vs. State Rep. By 
The Inspector of Police and others), decided on 28.01.2016, this Court
considered the various decisions rendered by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in
this regard in several cases, namely, <a href="/doc/69949024/" id="a_10">Gian Singh vs. State of Punjab and
another</a> [(2012) 10 SCC 303], <a href="/doc/469138/" id="a_11">B.S.Joshi vs. State of Haryana</a> [(2003) 4 SCC
675], <a href="/doc/393489/" id="a_12">Nikhil Merchant vs. CBI</a> [(2008) 9 SCC 677], <a href="/doc/160278245/" id="a_13">Narinder Singh and others
vs. State of Punjab and another</a> [(2014) 6 SCC 466] and <a href="/doc/16596453/" id="a_14">State of Madhya
Pradesh vs. Manish and others</a> [(2015) 8 SCC 307] and observed as under: 
</p><p id="p_7">        ?11. If the offences against women and children and the <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_15">IPC</a> offences
falling under the categories, like, murder, attempt to murder, offence
against unsound mind, rape, bribe, fabrication of documents, false evidence,
robbery, dacoity, abduction, kidnapping, minor girl rape, idol theft,
preventing a public servant from discharging of his/her duty, outrage of
woman modesty, counterfeiting currency notes or bank notes, etc., are allowed
to be compounded, it will surely have serious repercussion on the society, as
the above mentioned list is only illustrative and not exhaustive. Similarly,
any compromise between the victim and the offender in relation to the
offences clubbed with Special Enactment, like <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_16">Arms Act</a>, the <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_17">Prevention of
Corruption Act</a>, TNPPDL Act, TNPID Act or the offences committed by Public 
Servants while working in that capacity, etc., cannot provide for any basis
for quashing criminal proceedings involving such offences. As held by the
Apex Court, insofar the offences arising out of matrimonial dispute, relating
to dowry or the family disputes where the wrong is basically private or
personal in nature, are concerned, the possibility of conviction is remote
and bleak, in case the parties resolve their entire disputes amicably among
themselves. This Court feels that there cannot be any compromise in respect
of the heinous and serious offences of mental depravity and in that case, the
Court should be very slow in accepting the compromise. If the compromise is
entertained mechanically by the Court, the accused will have the upper hand.
The jurisdiction of this Court may not be allowed to be exploited by the
accused, who can well afford to wait for a logical conclusion. The
antecedents of the accused have also to be taken into consideration before
accepting the memo of compromise and the accused, by means of compromise,     
cannot try to escape from the clutches of law."
</p>
<p id="p_8">                6.Taking note of the judgments referred to supra, considering the
nature of allegations and also considering the fact that the dispute between
the petitioners and second respondent/defacto complainant has been settled
amicably and the defacto complainant has no objection to quash the FIR in
Crime No.64 of 2017 and to that effect a joint memo of compromise has also
been filed on 07.06.2018, this Court is of the opinion that no useful purpose
would be served in keeping the matter pending. Therefore, the entire
proceedings in Crime No.64 of 2017 pending on the file of the first
respondent in respect of the petitioners/accused Nos.1 to 13 are hereby
quashed. 
</p><p id="p_9">                7.Accordingly, this Criminal Original Petition is allowed on the
basis of the compromise entered into between the parties. The joint
compromise memo filed on 07.06.2018 shall form part of this order.
</p><p id="p_10">                8.The learned counsel appearing for the petitioners submitted
that the petitioners are willing to contribute some amount to the District
Legal Services Authority, Pudukottai under the Head ?Environmental Fund? to
preserve the environment. Hence, each petitioner is directed to remit a sum
of Rs.1,500/- (Total sum of Rs.19,500/-) as costs within a period of two
weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of this order, by way of an
individual/collective Demand Draft drawn in favour of the Legal Services
Authority, Pudukottai, who shall receive the said amount as ?Environmental
Fund? and make use of the said amount for the purposes mentioned in the order
passed by this Court in CRP (NPD) No.1643 of 2010 on 20.06.2018  
[D.Govindasamy Vs. L.Ganesh Naidu (Deceased) and 2 others]. A report in this 
regard shall be sent by the Legal Services Authority, Pudukottai to the
Member Secretary, Tamil Nadu State Legal Services Authority, Chennai, 
mentioning clearly the amounts spent towards the purposes mentioned in the
above order and the balance amount left etc.,
