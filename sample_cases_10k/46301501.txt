JUDGMENT
</pre><p id="p_1">    1. The case of the prosecution is that on 10.11.2000 near H.No. 27/1, Old
         Rajinder Nagar, the accused got recovered one maruti car bearing no.
         DL 8CA 7843 which was stolen on 31.10.2000 from the house of
         complainant which the accused had retained knowing or having reason
         to believe the same to be a stolen property and thereby, he committed
         offence punishable u/s 411 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_2">IPC</a>.
</p>

<p id="p_2">    2. After investigation, charge-sheet was filed against the accused. The
         copies of charge-sheet were supplied to the accused in compliance of



FIR No. 350/2000
PS: Prasad Nagar
State v. Vijay @ Raja                                                           1/7
          <a href="/doc/1613898/" id="a_3">Section 207</a> Cr. P. C. Thereafter, charge was framed against the
         accused under <a href="/doc/812083/" id="a_4">Section 411</a> IPC to which he pleaded not guilty and
         claimed trial.
</p>

<p id="p_3">    3. In support of its version, prosecution examined one witness. PW-1 HC
         Devender Singh submitted that on 31.10.2000, upon receipt a call vide
         DD No. 44 Ex. PW-1/A, he alongwith DHG Ct. Om Pal reached on
         the spot i.e. Shamshan Ghat, Ravidass Marg where complainant
         Mahender Grover met him; he recorded his statement Ex. PW-1/B; he
         made his endorsement and got the FIR recorded through Ct. Om Pal
         vide FIR Mark A; he prepared site plan Ex. PW-1/C at the instance of
         the complainant; thereafter, he made the search for culprit as well as
         the case property but no clue was found. He got the message flashed
         about the above-said theft of the vehicle i.e. Maruti Car bearing
         registration no. DL-8CA-7843. On 11.11.2000, HC Krishan from PS
         Rajender Nagar informed that accused alongwith above-said vehicle
         had been apprehended at PS Rajender Nagar; thereafter, he alongwith
         Ct. Yatender reached at PS Rajender Nagar and met SI Rakesh who
         handed over him photostate copies of the disclosure statement, seizure
         memo of the vehicle and copy of FIR vide Mark B, C and D
         respectively. He interrogated accused Vijay @ Raja and Rajesh @
         Khanna @ Chottu and arrested them vide their arrest memos Ex.
         PW-1/D and PW-1/E. He intimated father of both the accused persons
         vide information Ex. PW-1/F. He tendered pointing out memo vide
         Ex. PW-1/G. He got the said vehicle transferred from PS Rajender
         Nagar to PS Prasad Nagar and deposited the same in the malkhana.</p><pre id="pre_2">



FIR No. 350/2000
PS: Prasad Nagar
State v. Vijay @ Raja                                                        2/7
</pre><p id="p_4">          The said vehicle was released on superdari vide superdaginama Ex.
         PW-1/H. He further stated that it had come into his notice that the
         complainant was not traceable despite best efforts.
</p>

<p id="p_5">    4. After conclusion of evidence, statement of the accused was recorded
         wherein he claimed to be innocent and denied the allegations against
         him. He stated that he did not commit the theft of maruti car. Nothing
         had been recovered from his possession or at his instance. He had
         been falsely implicated in this case. He did not opt to lead defence
         evidence.
</p>

<p id="p_6">    5. I have heard Ld. APP for State and Ld. Counsel for accused. I have
         perused the record.
</p>

<p id="p_7">    6. Ld. Defence Counsel argued that prosecution has not examined the
         complainant despite having been granted several opportunities to it.
         Further, the investigating officer did not join any independent witness
         while preparing the seizure memo Mark C. Further, site plan was not
         got signed by any witness. Ld. Counsel for the accused further argued
         that the investigating officer did not prepare site plan of the spot from
         where the car was recovered; photographs of the vehicle were not
         taken at the time of its recovery and above all, even the car was not
         produced before the Court during trial. Hence, prosecution had failed
         to prove its case.
</p>

<p id="p_8">    7. The case of the prosecution is that impugned maruti car was recovered



FIR No. 350/2000
PS: Prasad Nagar
State v. Vijay @ Raja                                                          3/7
          at the instance of the accused. Firstly, the prosecution did not trace,
         produce and examine the complainant PW Mahender Grover. On
         03.05.2012, summons to PW Mahender Grover to be executed through
         DCP concerned were received back with report 'left the given address'.
         In these circumstances, when the testimony of the complainant was
         essential to prove that the recovered car belonged to him; the
         prosecution has failed to prove that the recovered car was a stolen
         property belonging to the complainant.
</p>

<p id="p_9">    8. Further, PW-1 tendered the disclosure statement of the accused and
         seizure memo Mark B and Mark C respectively. Perusal of these
         documents reveals that the impugned car was recovered from public
         place i.e. parked in front of H.No. 27/1, Old Rajender Nagar, Delhi. It
         is not the case of prosecution that the H.No. 27/1 belonged to the
         accused. The place of recovery is a public place. Further, the
         impugned recovery has been made pursuant to the disclosure
         statement of the accused. The place of recovery was an open place
         which could be accessed by public at large including the police
         officials; hence, the accused could not be said to have exclusive
         possession over the car and the information of whereabouts of the car.
         The legal position qua admissibility of the disclosure statement vis-a-
         vis <a href="/doc/1312051/" id="a_5">Section 27</a> of the Evidence Act is explained by the Higher Courts
         in various cases.
</p>

<p id="p_10">    9. The Apex Court in Dudh Nath v. State of U. P., 1981 CRI. L. J. 618,
         has held that:</p><pre id="pre_3">



FIR No. 350/2000
PS: Prasad Nagar
State v. Vijay @ Raja                                                        4/7
</pre><p id="p_11">                    15. [E]vidence of recovery of the pistol at the instance
                   of the appellant cannot by itself prove that he who
                   pointed out the weapon wielded it in offence. The
                   statement accompanying the discovery is woefully
                   vague to identify the authorship of concealment, with
                   the result that the pointing out of the weapon may at
                   best prove the appellant's knowledge as to where the
                   weapon was kept.
</p>

<p id="p_12">    10. The Hon'ble Delhi High Court in <a href="/doc/1506108/" id="a_6">Vijay Kumar v. State</a>, 1996 CRI.
</p><p id="p_13">         L. J. 2429, held that:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">                   42. As far as recovery of a piece of hockey from the
                   room of the appellant, Vijay, is concerned, the said
                   piece of hockey was not lying hidden anywhere. A
                   casual search of the room by the police, would have
                   yielded the said piece of hockey. <a href="/doc/1312051/" id="a_7">Section 27</a> of the
                   Evidence Act could make such disclosure statement
                   of the accused in custody admissible which leads to
                   discovery of a material fact but if a material fact is
                   self-evident to the police, the disclosure statement of
                   the accused of such material fact becomes
                   inadmissible. In case a particular material fact is in
                   exclusive knowledge of the accused and he makes a
                   disclosure statement pertaining to the same which
                   leads to recovery of such material fact, then and then
                   only such disclosure statement of the accused is
                   admissible in evidence. So, this recovery of piece of
                   hockey cannot be linked to the accused Vijay in view
                   of the above reasons. Moreover, Premwati had stated
                   in Court that Vijay had thrown away the second piece
                   of hockey outside his house. If that is so, the
                   disclosure statement of the appellant, Vijay, becomes
                   all the more doubtful.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_14">    11. In these circumstances, no portion of disclosure statement of the
         accused can be held admissible under <a href="/doc/1312051/" id="a_8">Section 27</a> of the Evidence Act.</p><pre id="pre_4">



FIR No. 350/2000
PS: Prasad Nagar
State v. Vijay @ Raja                                                         5/7
</pre><p id="p_15">          Moreover, in view of observation in the preceding paragraphs,
         argument of Ld. Counsel for the accused that no independent witness
         was joined in the investigation, finds relevance. First of all, I consider
         the legal position on this point. <a href="/doc/166513655/" id="a_9">In State of Punjab v. Balbir Singh</a>,
         AIR 1994 SC 1872, the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">                        8. It therefore emerges that non-compliance of these
                        provisions i.e. <a href="/doc/1137396/" id="a_10">Sections 100</a> and <a href="/doc/996365/" id="a_11">165</a> Cr.P.C. would
                        amount to an irregularity and the effect of the same
                        on the main case depends upon the facts and
                        circumstances of each case. Of course, in such a
                        situation, the court has to consider whether any
                        prejudice has been caused to the accused and also
                        examine the evidence in respect of search in the light
                        of the fact that these provisions have not been
                        complied with and further consider whether the
                        weight of evidence is in any manner affected
                        because of the non-compliance. It is well-settled that
                        the testimony of a witness is not to be doubted or
                        discarded merely on the ground that he happens to be
                        an official but as a rule of caution and depending
                        upon the circumstances of the case, the courts
                        look for independent corroboration. This again
                        depends on question whether the official has
                        deliberately failed to comply with these provisions or
                        failure was due to lack of time and opportunity to
                        associate some independent witnesses with the
                        search and strictly comply with these provisions.</blockquote>
<p id="p_16">                        [Emphasis supplied]

         Considering facts and circumstances of the present case, there was no
         lack of time and opportunity to associate some independent witnesses
         with the search and strictly comply with the provisions<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_12"> of Code</a> of
