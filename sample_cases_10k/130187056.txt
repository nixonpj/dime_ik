Writ Petition filed under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India for
the issue of a Writ of Certiorarified Mandamus to call for the records relating
to the impugned proceedings issued by the first respondent - Chief Educational
Officer in Mu.Mu.No.7937/A/5/2007, dated 08.12.2007 and his subsequent
proceedings in Mu.Mu.No.7638/Aa1/2008, dated 18.10.2008, quash the same insofar
as it renders one post of BT Assistant as surplus in the petitioner school and
further direct the second respondent District Educational Officer to approve

towards her salary and allowances.

!For Petitioner		: Mr.Isaac Mohanlal
For Respondents		: Mr.J.Gunaseelan Muthiah
			Government Advocate
				
:ORDER
</pre><p id="p_1">  ***********
	Challenge in this Writ Petition is to the orders, dated 08.12.2007 and
18.10.2008, rendering one post of BT Assistant as surplus in the petitioner
school and for a direction to the second respondent - District Educational
Officer to approve the appointment of Tmt.M.R.Shiju Rajan, as the second BT
Assistant in the petitioner school, with effect from 04.06.2007 and disburse
grant-in-aid towards her salary and allowances.
</p>
<p id="p_2">	2. The case of the petitioner school is that it offers education from
standards VI to XII. The total strength of the school is 366. There are 12
teachers [1 Headmistress, 7 PG Assistants, 2 BT Assistants and 2 Secondary Grade
Teachers]. On account of retirement of the then incumbent, Tmt.Y.Premavathy,
with effect from 31.05.2007, one Tmt.M.R.Shiju Rajan was appointed as BT
Assistant, with effect from 04.06.2007. The petitioner school forwarded a
proposal to the second respondent, on 14.08.2007, seeking to disburse grant-in-
aid towards her salary. However, by the impugned orders, the first respondent
rejected the claim of the petitioner school holding that one post of BT
Assistant is surplus.
</p>
<p id="p_3">	3. The learned counsel appearing for the petitioner school submits that it
is not disputed that the petitioner school has been granted recognition with
aid. Based on the assessment of the strength of the school only, additional
posts were sanctioned. He further submits that the impugned staff fixation
orders passed by the first respondent are in violation of the norms fixed by the
Government, in G.O.Ms.No.525, School Education [D1] Department, dated
29.12.1997. The said Government Order was issued superseding the earlier norms,
fixing teacher-pupil ratio issued in G.O.Ms.No.250, Education Department, dated
29.02.1964, and the said Government Order, issued in G.O.Ms.No.525, School
Education [D1] Department, dated 29.12.1997, is held applicable to both the
Government and Aided Recognized Private Schools.
</p>
<p id="p_4">	4. In support of his contention, the learned counsel makes reliance upon
the Judgment of a Full Bench of this Court in <a href="/doc/129990/" id="a_2">Director of Elementary Education,
Chennai-6 and others v. S.Vigila and another</a>, reported in 2006 (5) CTC 385. By
virtue of the said Judgment, each class shall have a teacher compulsorily based
on the students-teachers ratio, which has been propounded by the Government of
India as a National Policy, and therefore, on any account, there cannot be any
reduction in staff strength particularly, when the petitioner schools is
maintaining the students strength uniformly. Hence, declaring the post of BT
Assistant as surplus is unsustainable.
</p>
<p id="p_5">	5. The learned counsel appearing for the petitioner further submitted that
the petitioner school is entitled to have 5 teachers for standard VI to X alone
for the year 2007 - 2008. During the free hours, the High School teachers were
taking classes for higher secondary students and upon retirement of one
Tmt.Y.Premavathy, on 31.05.2007, Mrs.M.R.Shiju Rajan was appointed as B.T
Assistant with effect from 04.06.2007, and therefore, the respondents cannot
treat the appointment of Mrs.M.R.Shiju Rajan as surplus, and hence the staff
fixation for the year 2007- 2008 is bad in law. With regard to 2008-2009, the
number of students had considerably increased and crossed 40, and therefore, the
petitioner school was entitled to have additional teachers. The learned counsel
further contended that, on 05.06.2008, one teacher, by name, T.Delbi was
transferred to another school and with one Graduate teacher for History for the
Higher secondary standards and two teachers for Middle school, the school cannot
be run.
</p>
<p id="p_6">	6. Per contra, the learned Government Advocate appearing for the
respondents submitted that the number of teachers was in excess for the year
2007 - 2008, as the strength of the students had fallen down and the Post
Graduate teachers were left with 36 free hours and they can be utilized for
taking classes to the students of standards VIII, IX and X, instead of stressing
for approval of the second B.T Assistant post. The learned Government Advocate
further contended that the post of B.T Assistant was surrendered by the first
respondent, on 11.04.2008, as it was found surplus, and therefore, the same
could not be considered for the year 2008 - 2009. In view of the fact that
Mrs.M.R.Shiju Rajan was appointed in surplus vacancy, the salary and other
emoluments should be paid only by the petitioner, and therefore, sought the
dismissal of the Writ Petition.
</p>
<p id="p_7">	7. I have considered the above submissions and perused the records
carefully.
</p>
<p id="p_8">	8. The Full Bench of this Court in <a href="/doc/129990/" id="a_3">Director of Elementary Education,
Chennai-6 and others v. S.Vigila and another</a>, 2006 (5) CTC 385, giving
interpretation to G.O.Ms.No.525, School Education [D1] Department, dated
29.12.1997, in a meaningful manner, in Paragraph No.23,  held as follows:-
	"23.	Keeping in view the various relevant aspects, we feel that
G.O.Ms.No.525, dated 29.12.1997 should be interpreted in the following manner:
(1) The ratio of students-teacher strength as indicated in the G.O. Should be
primarily considered by taking each individual standard/section as a unit.
(2) The minimum strength of teachers required obviously should not fall below
the number of Standards/Section in a school.  In other words, if there are five
standards, obviously the minimum number of teachers should be five, out of which
one would be the Headmaster.
</p><p id="p_9">(3) If the students' strength in a particular Standard exceeds 60, at that
stage, an additional section is required to be created requiring the saction of
a second teacher and the strength reaches 100, the post of a third teacher is
required.
</p><p id="p_10">(4) Even after maintaining the aforesaid ratio by taking into account the
students' strength of each individual standard and additional section, as the
case may be, by keeping in view the teacher-students ratio 1:40 of the entire
school if the teachers strength is required to be increased, the same has to be
allowed, but in no case, the teachers' strength should be less than the number
of standards including the additional sections.  If more teachers are thus
sanctioned keeping in view the over all strength of the school, the authorities
of the school should create additional section in respect of any particular
Standard according to the need and convenience keeping in view the standard of
education.  This requirement is not only in respect of Aided Schools or
Government Schools, but also in respect of any Private Recognised School.  In
other words, this ratio is to be maintained for any school which required
recognition.
</p><p id="p_11">	5. It would be obviously open to the Government to formulate appropriate
norms in consonance with the above observation and provisions of the
Constitution."
</p>	
<p id="p_12">	9. As per the ratio laid down by the Full Bench of this Court, there is no
embargo for sanctioning more teachers based on the strength of the school.
Therefore, the stand of the first respondent that one post of B.T Assistant is
surplus does not stand water. Further, Mrs.M.R.Shiju Rajan was appointed with
effect from 04.06.2007, even before the surrender of the post by the first
respondent, on 11.04.2008. It is pertinent to mention here that only in the
vacant post, Mrs.M.R.Shiju Rajan was appointed and no additional post was
created. The post of B.T.Assistant was declared as Surplus in the impugned
proceedings, dated 08.12.2007, even before the post was surrendered. Therefore,
the impugned proceedings, on the face of it, are unsustainable. The purpose of
maintaining the ratio of 1: 40 is to sustain the quality of the education. Just
because, the number of students for a particular year goes down, the existing
teachers need not be disturbed. Fresh recruitment can be made if necessary in
case of increase in students as per the dictum of the Full Bench, referred to
supra. Upon examination of the impugned proceedings for the year 2008 - 2009, it
can be seen that the number of students had gone up. It is not disputed that one
teacher, T.Delpi, was also transferred to another school. Therefore, this Court
is of the view that the first respondent should have approved the post of B.T
Assistant. As held by the Full Bench, the student-Teacher ratio should be 1:40,
considering the overall strength of the school with a minimum of one teacher for
every standard/section. Therefore, the petitioner is entitled to have atleast 12
teachers for classes 1 to 12 irrespective of the number of students and in case
of additional sections, more teachers have to be recruited based on the ratio
laid down by the Full Bench. Approving the decision of the Division Bench, the
Full Bench, in Paragraph No.22, held as follows:
</p><p id="p_13">	"22.As rightly observed by the latter Division Bench, the G.O.Ms.No.525
has to be interpreted in a meaningful manner keeping in view the background in
which such G.O. came to be issued. As per the existing instructions applicable,
the ratio of teacher was dependant upon students' strength in each individual
standard, but it had been laid down that maximum strength in a particular
section or a class should be 35 or 40. In other words, either no admission was
required to be made in excess of 35 or 40 or if such admission was made taking
relevant permission, an additional section was required to be created. In the
context of the aforesaid background, the present G.O.Ms.No.525 indicates that an
additional section is required to be created only when the students' strength in
a standard becomes 60 or more. It is evident that G.O.Ms.No.525 has intended to
change this aspect and that is the reason why it has been indicated that when
the students strength becomes 100, a third teacher can be appointed. If it has
to be understood that the ratio of 1:40 is to be maintained in respect of the
entire school, it is not understood as to why it would be laid down in the G.O.
that a third teacher would be available when the students strength reaches 100.
In normal course, the third teacher would be provided only when the students
strength reaches 120 and not 100. This is rather indicative of the fact that the
G.O. was concerned about the creation of additional section. If the students'
strength in a particular standard remains 60 and below, there is no necessity to
create an additional section and the necessity to create additional section
arises only when the student strength in a particular standard exceeds 60 and
that is why it has been stated that if students' strength is further increased
by 40 more, another teacher would be sanctioned or would be required. The G.O.
cannot be interpreted to do away with requirement of having at least one teacher
for each standard or section (wherever creation of additional section is
justified).
</p>
<p id="p_14">	10. Therefore, the Government Order, passed in G.O.Ms.No.525, School
Education [D1] Department, dated 29.12.1997, is to be given a purposeful
interpretation. Just because, there was a dip in the strength of the students,
the respondents cannot surrender the post and treat the appointment as surplus.
</p>
<p id="p_15">	11. In view of the above, the impugned orders, which are in contravention
of G.O.Ms.No.525, School Education [D1] Department, dated 29.12.1997 and the
dictum laid down by the Full Bench are set aside. The respondents are directed
to re-fix the staff strength by approving the appointment of Mrs.M.R.Shiju Rajan
as B.T Assistant and release the grant-in-aid towards payment of salary and
other allowances due to her. The Writ Petition is allowed, as indicated above.
No costs. Consequently, connected Miscellaneous Petitions are closed.
