(M/S SHRIJI PROMOTERS AND DEVELOPERS PRIVATE LIMITED Vs THE STATE OF MADHYA
                                 PRADESH)


02-08-2017

      Shri Harjas Singh Chabbra, learned counsel for the
petitioner.
      Shri Divesh Jain, learned Government Advocate for
the respondents/State.</pre>
<p id="p_1">      Heard on I.A. No.10382/2017, which is an
application for amendment in the memo of writ petition.
</p><p id="p_2">      Application is allowed.
</p><p id="p_3">      Necessary amendment be carried out within a
period of one week.
</p><p id="p_4">      The petitioner has also filed the I.A.
No.10392/2017, which is an application for stay of the
order dated 18.07.2017 passed by respondent No.2-
Collector.
</p><p id="p_5">      The contention of the learned counsel for the
petitioner is that this Court on 30.06.2017 has directed
that the operation of the order (Annexure P/6) dated
12.06.2017 which has been challenged by the petitioner
shall remain stayed. In the order (Annexure P/6) dated
12.06.2017 the Collector had directed the petitioner to
handover the possession of the flats to the purchasers
viz. the respondents No.4 and 5 and now again a
proceeding has been initiated in Jansunwai wherein the
S.P., Jabalpur has been directed to take appropriate
steps and also to register the criminal case under
 appropriate sections. In the order dated 18.07.2017 it is
not mentioned as to who are the other complainants who
have been filed the complaints against the petitioner.
</p><p id="p_6">      The petitionerâs contention is that the flats have
already been constructed and at the time of possession
when he issued a notice for entire payment to the private
respondents, the aforesaid proceedings have been
initiated with malafide intention. After hearing the
counsel for the parties and perusing the record, this
Court finds that the order dated 18.07.2017 is also liable
to be stayed as the same has been issued without
specifying the provisions of law under which it has been
so passed. In the circumstances, the impugned order
dated 18.07.2017 is hereby stayed.
</p><p id="p_7">      The respondents are directed to produce the copies
of complaints which have been filed by the complainants
to the Collector as also the stage of the construction
which, as claimed by the petitioner is already complete.
</p><p id="p_8">     List the matter on 22.08.2017.
</p><p id="p_9">     A typed copy of this order be supplied to the
learned counsel for the State for necessary compliance.
</p>


<p id="p_10">                                  (SUBODH ABHYANKAR)
