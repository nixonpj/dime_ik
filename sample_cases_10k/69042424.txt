                    ---------------------------------------
                       W.P.(C) No.20603 of 2013
                   ----------------------------------------
                Dated this the 30th day of August, 2013

                           JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">         The petitioner was an applicant for selection to the post of

Mazdoor (Electricity Worker) in the Kerala State Electricity Board. The

first respondent issued Ext.P2 notification therefor and a written test

was conducted as part of the selection process on 26.11.2011. The

petitioner was included in the shortlist published for attending physical

efficiency test on 13.5.2013 and subject to its outcome, for verification

of documents. The contention of the petitioner is that he was in

Malaysia for taking up employment and hence, could not appear for the

physical efficiency test and also could not produce the documents for

verification. The petitioner submitted Exts.P4 and P5 representations

respectively before respondent 1 and 2 explaining the reasons as to why

he could not appear for the physical efficiency test and seeking

permission to participate in the physical test scheduled to be conducted

at any other district for the same post. It is feeling aggrieved by the

inaction on Exts.P4 and P5 by the respondents that this writ petition has

been filed.

<p id="p_2">W.P.(C) No.20603 of 2013
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                         2</span>




</p><p id="p_3">               2.      I have heard the learned counsel for the petitioner, the

learned standing counsel appearing for 1 and 2 and also the learned

standing counsel appearing for the third respondent.




</p><p id="p_4">             3.         A perusal of the reliefs sought for by the petitioner

would reveal that the petitioner is seeking a direction to respondents 1 to

2 to consider Exts.P4 and P5 representations and to permit him to appear

for the physical test to be conducted in any other district for the same

post. The post in question is Mazdoor (Electricity worker) under the

Electricity Board and necessarily the physical efficiency of candidates

have to be tested. Obviously, on 13.5.2013            the respondents have

conducted physical efficiency test and verified the documents of those

who came through the said test. Evidently, the petitioner was also aware

of the said fact and that is why in Exts.P4 and P5 he sought for an

opportunity to appear for a physical efficiency test.           The learned

standing counsel appearing for the third respondent submitted that the

selection process is in the final stage and it has reached up to the stage of

preparation of ranked list. When that be so, granting opportunity to the

W.P.(C) No.20603 of 2013
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                     3</span>

petitioner to appear for the physical efficiency test will obviously affect

the finalization of the selection process and it may also prompt others, if

any, who failed to attend the physical efficiency test for various reason

to approach the respondents with similar requests. At any rate, when the

recruiting process is in the final stage of preparation of ranked list

interference will only delay its finalisation and such an eventuality will

not be in the interest of justice. That apart, absence or abstinence for

taking up some other employment cannot be considered as a good

ground for seeking a further opportunity to take part in physical

efficiency test. The question of verification of documents would arise

only in case of those who came through the physical efficiency test. At

this stage of the selection process, physical efficiency test and

consequential verification of documents cannot be ordered in the case of

the petitioner. For the foregoing reasons, this writ petition is liable to

fail. Accordingly it is dismissed.
