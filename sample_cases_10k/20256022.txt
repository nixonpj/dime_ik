1.</pre><p id="p_1"> As   per   prosecution   case   on   02.08.2015   complainant   was
    present at his home  I.e  infront of 119/8 Shiv Mandir Gali No. 8,
    Maujpur,   Delhi   and   at   about   4.15   p.m,   complainant   heard
    conversation of some boys and also felt the smell of cigarette
    and when he came outside of his house, he noticed that two
    boys   were   smoking   the   cigarettes   and   when   the   complainant
    told   them   to   go   away   from   there   and   smoke   the   cigarette
    somewhere else,  they got annoyed. One boy who was wearing
    kurta-payjama   started   quarreling   with   the   complainant   and

               SC No. 82/<a href="/doc/82050546/" id="a_3">15       State vs Salman           Page</a> 1/4
   another boy who was wearing pant put the knife on his stomach
  and snatched gold chain weighing about 10 gms from his neck
  and also took out the wallet from his pant which contained Rs.
  70/­, photocopy of his DL and visiting cards and thereafter both
  of   them   started   going   towards   the   park.   Complainant   chased
  them by shouting chor­chor and public persons gathered there
  and apprehended one boy who was wearing Kurta and Payjama
  who later on revealed his name as Salman. The other accused
  managed to escape.   A knife and a wallet was recovered from
  the possession of accused Salman, however, gold chain could
  not   be   recovered.   Thereafter,   on   the   complaint   of   the
  complainant,  the   present   case  was   registered  u/s   392/397/34
  <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_4">IPC</a> in PS Jafrabad and matter was investigated into and after
  completion   of   investigation   accused   Salman   was   charge
  sheeted in this case. 
</p><p id="p_2">2. Vide order dt. 05.12.2015, a charge u/s 392/397/34 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_5">IPC</a> was
  framed against the accused  to which he pleaded not guilty and
  claimed   trial.   After   that   case   was   fixed   for   prosecution
  evidence.
</p><p id="p_3">3. In support of its case, prosecution has cited 10 witnesses and
  by now the prosecution has already examined two witnesses.
  Out of these two witnesses, PW­1 Mr. Rajveer (Complainant),
  is   the   star/eye   witness   and   other   witnesses   are   formal
  witnesses.
</p><p id="p_4">4. The   complainant/PW­1   Sh.   Rajveer   is   the   complainant/eye
  witness, however, he has not supported the prosecution case
  and remained completely hostile in regard to the identification
  of the accused. He has deposed that accused Salman is not


              SC No. 82/<a href="/doc/82050546/" id="a_6">15     State vs Salman           Page</a> 2/4
   the  same person who robbed him.    
</p><p id="p_5">         This   witness   was   cross   examined   by   Ld.   Addl.   P.P   at
  length,   however,   nothing   material   could   be   extracted.   This
  witness has denied the suggestions put by Ld. Addl. P.P for the
  State   that   a   knife   and   his   wallet   was   recovered     from   the
  possession of accused Salman and he also denied that knife
  was also seized by the IO in his presence. Thus, this witness
  has   failed   to   support   the   prosecution   case   in   regard   to   the
  identification   of   accused   as   well   as   that   the   recovery   was
  effected from the accused Salman. Thus, in the absence of the
  support   of   the   complainant,   prosecution   would   not   be   in
  position to prove its case against the accused..
</p><p id="p_6">5. The complainant/injured has failed to support the prosecution
  case and It is clear from the aforesaid discussions that nothing
  incriminating has come on record against the accused in the
  deposition   of   the   complainant/injured   examined   by   the
  prosecution. The rest of the witnesses cited by prosecution are
  of   formal   in   nature.   As   such,   no   useful   purpose   would   be
  served in examining the rest of the prosecution witnesses and
  it would be sheer wastage of the precious time of the court.
  Hence,   the   prosecution   evidence   is   hereby   closed   and   the
  request of Ld. Addl. P.P for examining rest of the witnesses is
  hereby declined as in the absence of support of the aforesaid
  witnesses,   the   prosecution   would   never   be   in   a   position   to
  prove its case against the accused.
</p><p id="p_7">6. As there is no conclusive incriminating evidence available on
  record against the accused, statement of accused is dispensed
  with and accused is directed to be acquitted of charge leveled
