             W.P. 3093(W) of 2016

               Tapan Kumar Patra
                      -vs-
            State of West Bengal &amp; Ors.

        Mr. Dilip Kumar Sinha
                        ... for the Petitioner



        Affidavit of service filed by the learned Advocate for the petitioner in Court

 today be kept on record.

        Despite service of notice, none appears on behalf of the respondent authorities.       No</pre>

<p id="p_1"> adjournment has been sought for.
</p>
<p id="p_2">        The petitioner has filed the present writ petition for a direction upon the respondent

 authorities, specially the respondent no. 4, the District Panchayat &amp; Rural Development Officer,

 Tamluk, Purba Medinipur, to take a decision for giving appointment to the petitioner on

 compassionate ground on the basis of the recommendation made by the Deputy Director,

 Panchayat &amp; Rural Development on 31st March, 2010.
</p>
<p id="p_3"> Mr. Dilip Kr. Sinha, learned Advocate appearing for the petitioner, submits that the petitioner's

 father was working as Gram Panchayat Karmee under Baishnabchak Gram Panchayat and he

 died-in-harness on 25th February, 1995. Thereafter on 17th April, 1995 the petitioner made a

 representation before the authority for giving appointment on compassionate ground. Thereafter

 on 31st March, 2010 the Deputy Director, Panchayat &amp; Rural Development issued a letter to the

 District Panchayat &amp; Rural Development Officer, Tamluk, Purba Medinipur thereby proposing the

 petitioner's name for appointment on compassionate ground for the post of Gram Panchayat

 Karmee. Since nothing has been done by the respondent authorities, therefore, the petitioner

 without finding any alternative made a representation dated 10th September, 2014. In spite of

 such representation the respondent authorities are sitting tight over the petitioner's claim.

 Hence, the present writ petition.

Panchayat &amp; Rural Development on 31st March, 2010 for giving appointment to the petitioner on

compassionate ground within a period of six weeks from the date of communication of this order

after giving an opportunity of hearing to the petitioner or his authorised representative and

thereafter communicate the decision to the petitioner within one week.

</p><p id="p_6">       With this direction, this writ petition is disposed of.
