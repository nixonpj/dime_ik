Present:     Mr. Ranbir Singh Sekhon, Advocate
             for the petitioner.

             Mr. Harbir Sandhu, AAG, Punjab.

Rajbir Sehrawat, J(Oral)

</pre><p id="p_1">             The present petition has been filed by the petitioner under

<a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_1">Section 439</a> Cr.P.C. for grant of bail pending trial in case FIR No.96 dated

30.08.2018 registered under <a href="/doc/695990/" id="a_2">Section 364</a> IPC (Sections 302, 379-B, 201, 34

<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_3">IPC</a> have been added later on) at Police Station Kulgari, District Ferozepur.

</p><p id="p_2">             It is contended by counsel for the petitioner that the petitioner

has been wrongly involved in this case. Otherwise the petitioner has no

concern with the alleged crime at all. Still further, it is submitted that there

was delay of two days in lodging the FIR and even the FIR was lodged

against unknown persons and was lodged only qua son of the complainant

going missing. However, after about two months the statement of one

Swaran Singh was recorded by the police in attempt to drag the name of the

petitioner into the crime. Even as per that statement said Swaran Singh is

alleged to have stated that he had heard the petitioner and his co-accused

discussing that they had already killed the son of the complainant. However,

this is only a concocted hear-say version of the said Swaran Singh. The

</p>
<p id="p_3">petitioner never gathered with his other co-accused at the said place, as

alleged by Swaran Singh. It is also contended that even during investigation

the police have not been able to collect any evidence to connect the

petitioner to the alleged crime, except the unfounded statement of above

said Swaran Singh. Therefore, there is no admissible evidence on the file of

the prosecution or the court to connect the petitioner to the crime alleged

against him.
</p>
<p id="p_4">               On the other hand, counsel for the State, being instructed by

ASI Sukhdev Singh, submits that the name of the petitioner has come in the

statement of Swaran Singh who had heard the petitioner and his co-accused,

talking about having committed murder of the deceased. Still further it is

submitted that, one of the co-accused-Sonu, has also suffered a disclosure

statement that he and the present petitioner, along with others had

committed murder of the deceased. Therefore, the culpability of the

petitioner qua the crime, stands fully explained. However, it is not disputed

that except these two statements of PW-Swaran Singh and coaccused Sonu,

there is nothing on record to connect the petitioner to the alleged crime.

</p><p id="p_5">               As response to this argument of counsel for the State, learned

counsel for the petitioner submits that; so far as the statement of Swaran

Singh is concerned, as submitted above, he has deposed only about hear-

say; as perceived by him. Even the co-accused Sonu has made the alleged

disclosure statement while in police custody. Therefore, none of the

statements, relied upon by the prosecution, are admissible piece of evidence.

Still further, it is submitted that by any means, even these two statements are

not sufficient to hold the petitioner as guilty of the crime alleged against

him. In view the above, but without expressing any further opinion on the
