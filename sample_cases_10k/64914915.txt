                  25.07.2009. That is how, the plaintiff is before this court, in

                  Ram Narain son of Pat Ram, vide a registered sale deed dated

                  26.10.1999. Subsequently, plaintiff raised a construction over

                  whereas, plot bearing khasra No.146/851 was kept vacant.

                  Defendant No.2 was owner of a plot situated towards the

                  southern side of the disputed plot i.e. plot bearing khasra

                  place, in her absence, on 12.08.2003, defendants dug the

                  foundation of the plot of the plaintiff and raised four wall

                  thereon and thus unauthorizedly occupied the said plot.

                  17.11.1997. Thus, the defendants were owners in possession

                  of the plots No.36 and 37. And now, the plaintiff intended to

                  forcibly occupy the plot of defendant No.1 and thus filed the

<p id="p_6">                                  The trial court on an analysis of the matter in issue

                  and the evidence on record, found that the plaintiff had

                  purchased two plots bearing old Nos.40 and 42 and bearing

                  new khasra Nos.146/849 and 146/851, vide registered sale

                  deed dated 25.10.1999. Plots No.146/849 and No.146/851

                  consisted of an area measuring 4 marlas each. Whereas,

                  defendant No.1 had purchased plot bearing old No.37 falling in

                  khasra         No.146/812,     vide   registered    sale   deed    dated

                  17.11.1997 (Ex.P3). It was observed that in fact the plot that

                  was          purchased    by   the    defendants,     bearing     khasra

                  No.146/812, was previously numbered as No.3 and not No.37.

                  Since plaintiff had prayed for a decree for possession against

                  the defendants, the onus to prove that the defendants had

                  actually encroached upon a plot bearing khasra No.146/851

                  was upon the plaintiff. However, no evidence was led to prove

                  that the said plot or a portion thereof was indeed encroached

                  by the defendants or clubbed within their plot bearing khasra

                  No.146/812. So much so, plaintiff herself was unsure about

                  her case as well as the property in dispute. In her cross-

                  examination, she testified that she had purchased two plots

                  and their old numbers were 38 and 39, whereas, her pleaded

                  case was that the previous numbers of the plots she had

                  purchased were 40 and 42. The evidence led by the defendants

                  showed that in fact the plaintiff had constructed a house over

                  both the plots, she had purchased. Nothing was brought on

                  record to show as to how much area, the plaintiff was indeed

                  in possession of.         Plaintiff never made any endeavour to get

                  the disputed property demarcated to show as to what portion

                  of khasra No.146/851 was encroached by the defendants and

                  therefore a decree for possession was required to be passed.

                  Still further, the version of the plaintiff that in her absence the

                  defendants had encroached upon the suit property, was also

                  repelled by the trial court.       As she pleaded that she had left

                  the house only for two days, when the defendants occupied

                  her plot. However, she also maintained that in her absence,

                  the defendants not only dug the foundation but also raised

                  four walls on the plot. Had that been the case, plaintiff would

                  have examined at least one witness of the locality, to support

                  her plea. Accordingly, suit was dismissed.

</p><p id="p_7">                               Being aggrieved against the said decree, an appeal

                  itself in concurrence with the view drawn by the trial court

                  and the findings recorded in support thereof. It was observed

                  that the plaintiff herself was not sure about her case, as in

                  cross-examination, she claimed to have purchased plots No.38

                  and 39, whereas, the previous numbers of the plot purchased

                  by her were 40 and 42.        The definite case set out by the

                  defendants was that they had purchased plot No.37 (old)

                  bearing khasra No.146/812, plaintiff failed to prove that the

                  plot in possession of the defendants was in fact part of khasra

                  No.146/851 owned by her. Plaintiff failed to get the property

                  demarcated to substantiate her claim. That being so, the

                  appeal preferred by the plaintiff was dismissed.

                  Nothing was brought on record to show that the plot owned by

                  the plaintiff bearing khasra No.146/851 or a portion thereof

                  was encroached or in possession of the defendants.

</p><p id="p_11">                               The argument being advanced by the learned

                  counsel for the appellant lacks conviction and cannot be

                  imbibed. No doubt, plaintiff had moved an application to

                  adduce additional evidence and prove a demarcation report.

                  However, the said application was rejected by the first

                  appellate court, vide order dated 25.07.2009. Apparently, the

                  plaintiff failed to meet the requirement of provisions of Order

                  41 Rule 27 of the Civil Procedure Code. Further, the report

                  that was sought to be brought on record, revealed that the

                  demarcation was carried out without even establishing any

                  pucca points, as houses had been constructed, so the pucca

                  points were taken from the built houses. That being so,

                  application deserved to be dismissed. Concededly, a decree for

                  possession was being prayed for. Specific case set out by the

                  plaintiff was that the plot owned by her bearing khasra

                  No.146/851 was encroached by the defendants while raising

                  construction upon the plot owned by them i.e. bearing khasra

                  No.146/812.       Thus, the short issue for consideration before

                  the courts below and even before this court was/is whether

                  the plot bearing khasra No.146/851 or any portion thereof

                  was in illegal possession or usurped by the defendants.

                  Needless to assert, the plaintiff failed to adduce any evidence

                  to substantiate as to how much area, comprised in khasra

                  No.146/851, she was in possession of and correspondingly,

                  what was the area that was encroached by the defendants.

                  Meaning thereby, for plaintiff to succeed, she was required to

                  have both the khasras, i.e. khasra No.146/851 and khasra

                  No.146/812, demarcated. Ex facie, the case set out by the

                  plaintiff remained unsubstantiated. So much so, she was not

                  even sure of the case set out by her. It is discernible from the

                  records that the plots purchased by the plaintiff i.e. bearing

                  khasra No.146/851 and bearing khasra No.146/849, were

                  previously numbered as 40 and 42.        However, in her cross-

                  examination, she claimed to have purchased plots bearing

                  No.38 and 39. Still further, DW2 (Amar Singh) testified in his

                  statement that in fact the plaintiff had constructed her house

                  on both the plots.

<p id="p_12">                               In the wake of the position as set out above and the

                  conclusions that have concurrently been recorded by both the

                  courts below, there hardly exists any ground, least plausible in

                  law, to interfere with the decrees being assailed in the present

                  appeal. No question of law, much less any substantial

                  question of law, arises for consideration. Appeal being devoid

                  of merit is, accordingly, dismissed.</p><pre id="pre_2">
