                                        Date of Decision: January 10, 2018

Gurjit Singh and others

<p id="p_1">CORAM: HON'BLE MRS. JUSTICE LISA GILL

Present:    Mr. Karanjit Singh, Advocate
            for the petitioners.

<p id="p_2">            Ms. Seena Mand, DAG, Punjab
            for respondent No.1-State.

<p id="p_4">LISA GILL J. (ORAL)

            Prayer in this petition is for quashing of FIR No.5 dated

12.01.2017 under <a href="/doc/988620/" id="a_1">Sections 406</a>, <a href="/doc/538436/" id="a_2">498-A</a> IPC registered at Police Station

Tanda, District Hoshiarpur along with all subsequent proceedings arising

therefrom on the basis of compromise dated 17.05.2017 (Annexure P-2).

</p><p id="p_5">            The afore-mentioned FIR was registered at the instance of

respondent No.2 due to matrimonial discord with her husband i.e.,

petitioner No.1. However, with the intervention of respectables, the matter

has been amicably resolved. The terms and conditions of settlement were

reduced into writing.
</p>
<p id="p_6">            It is informed that pursuant to the compromise between the

parties, respondent No.2 is residing with petitioner No.1 at her

matrimonial home. She has no objection to the quashing of the

aforementioned FIR against all the accused petitioners.

             The parties were directed to appear before the Illaqa

Magistrate for recording of the statements in respect to the settlement by

this Court on 24.05.2017. The learned Illaqa Magistrate was directed to

submit a report regarding the settlement.
</p>
<p id="p_8">             Pursuant to orders dated 24.05.2017 and 17.07.2017, the

parties appeared before the learned Judicial Magistrate First Class, Dasuya

and their statements were recorded on 31.07.2017. Respondent No.2

stated that the matter has been amicably resolved by her out of her own

free will, without any pressure or coercion with all the accused petitioners.

Copy of the compromise was produced as Mark 'A'. It is further stated by

respondent No.2 that she has no objection to the quashing of the

aforementioned FIR against all the accused-petitioners. Separate statement

of all the petitioners in respect to the settlement was recorded as well.

</p><p id="p_9">             As per report dated 24.08.2017 received from the learned

Judicial Magistrate First Class, Dasuya, satisfaction is expressed that

compromise between the parties has been arrived at voluntarily, out of the

free will of all the parties, without any pressure, coercion, undue influence

or any fear. None of the accused persons are reported to be proclaimed

offenders.
</p>
<p id="p_10">             Learned counsel for respondent No.2 reaffirms and verifies

the factum of settlement between the parties. It is reiterated that

respondent No.2 has no objection to the quashing of the abovementioned

FIR subject to strict adherence to the terms and conditions of the

settlement by the petitioners.

              Learned counsel for the State submits that as the abovesaid

FIR arises out of a matrimonial dispute, the State has no objection to the

quashing of this FIR on the basis of a settlement arrived at between the

parties.

<p id="p_13">              In Kulwinder Singh and others versus State of Punjab and

another 2007 (3) R.C.R. (Criminal) 1052, a five member Bench of this

Court has observed as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">                        "The compromise, in a modern society, is the sine
              qua non of harmony and orderly behaviour. It is the soul of
              justice and if the power under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_3">Section 482</a> of the Criminal
              Procedure Code is used to enhance such a compromise
              which, in turn, enhances the social amity and reduces
              friction, then it truly is "finest hour of justice".</blockquote><p id="p_14">

</p><p id="p_15">              The Hon'ble Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/469138/" id="a_4">B.S.Joshi and others v. State

of Haryana</a>, 2003(4) SCC 675 has observed that it becomes the duty of

the Court to encourage genuine settlements of matrimonial disputes.

</p><p id="p_16">              Keeping in view the facts and circumstances of this case, it

would be in the interest of justice to quash the abovesaid FIR as no useful

purpose would be served by continuance of the present proceedings. It

will merely lead to wastage of precious time of the court and would be an

exercise in futility.
</p>
<p id="p_17">              This petition is, thus, allowed and FIR No.15 dated

18.04.2017 under <a href="/doc/455468/" id="a_5">Sections 307</a>, <a href="/doc/1868826/" id="a_6">498</a> A IPC registered at Police Station

Lakhewali, District Sri Muktsar Sahib along with all consequential

proceedings are, hereby, quashed.
</p>
<p id="p_18">              However, liberty is afforded to respondent No.2 to file

necessary application for revival of the proceedings in the above said FIR,

in case the terms and conditions of settlement between the parties are not

adhered to by the petitioner(s) or it is found that the settlement was a mere

ruse to have the aforesaid FIR quashed.</p><pre id="pre_2">
