                           Order On Board

4/10/2016

</p><p id="p_8">  1. Heard.
</p>
<p id="p_9">
</p><p id="p_10">  2. The matter pertains to entitlement or apportionment of the

     award amount fixed by the competent authority i.e. SDO

     (Revenue)-cum-Land Acquisition Officer, Kharsia District Raigarh

     in the proceedings under the <a href="/doc/1222415/" id="a_1">National Highways Act</a>, 1956 (in

     short "the Act, 1956").
</p>
<p id="p_11">
</p><p id="p_12">  3. It appears the petitioners own land bearing Khasra No.105/02

     and 105/03 respectively, which was initially included in the plan

     for widening/four-laning/construction of National Highways,

     however, while preparing the award, the compensation has

     been assessed in the name of private respondents, who have

     encroached over the land belonging to the petitioners. The

     compensation has been assessed on presumption that the

     private respondents are occupants of the part of Abadi land of

     the village, whereas, according to the petitioners, they are not

     in possession of any part of Abadi land but the private

     respondents had occupied the petitioners' land, which has been

     included in the area falling for construction of National

     Highway.
</p>
<p id="p_13">
</p><p id="p_14">  4. Mr. Amit Sharma, learned counsel for the petitioners, would

     vehemently    argue       that    the    petitioners   having   moved

     representations   before         the    SDO(R)-cum-Land    Acquisition

     Officer or before the Collector, as the case may be, the matter
    should have been referred to the Principal Civil Court of original

   jurisdiction in terms of <a href="/doc/175068512/" id="a_2">Section 3H(4)</a> of the Act, 1956, however,

   the competent authority has failed to do so.


</p><p id="p_15">5. Having heard learned counsel for the parties and on perusal of

   the documents, it is revealed that the private respondents have

   been found entitled to compensation on the ground that they

   are in occupation of some part of Abadi land, which has been

   used for construction of National Highway. The compensation

   has been assessed under <a href="/doc/120401589/" id="a_3">Section 3G</a> of the Act, 1956 by

   publication   in   the    newspaper   published   on      13.07.2016

   (Annexure P/3) despite the fact that much before the said date,

   the petitioners have moved representations before the SDO(R)

   or Collector, as the case may be.
</p>
<p id="p_16">
</p><p id="p_17">6. Since this Court is not posted with the facts as to whether the

   competent     authority     has   passed   any    order     on   the

   representations moved by the petitioners in January 2016, but

   somehow the award has already been passed, therefore, at this

   stage of land acquisition proceedings, the only remedy left for

   the petitioners is to move a properly constituted application

   before the competent authority under <a href="/doc/175068512/" id="a_4">Section 3H(4)</a> of the Act,

   1956 for referring the matter to the Principal Civil Court of

   original jurisdiction to decide the issue about entitlement or

   apportionment of compensation in between the petitioner and

   the private respondents in each of the writ petitions.


</p><p id="p_18">7. Let the petitioners move such application within a period of 04

   weeks from today before the competent authority. On such

   application being preferred, the competent authority shall refer
         the matter to the Principal Civil Court of original jurisdiction

        within a further period of 04 weeks and thereafter, the Principal

        Civil Court of original jurisdiction shall decide the matter in

        accordance with law at the earliest.
