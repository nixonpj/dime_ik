By post
Mr K.R. Bishnoi, Addl. Govt. Advocate


BY THE COURT {Per Justice Narendra Kumar Jain-II}:</pre>


<p id="p_1">     Heard     learned      Addl.     Government           Advocate        and

perused material placed on the file.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">2)This Parole Petition is registered upon a letter received

from petitioner Pokar Ram s/o Bachna Ram, by caste- Nai,

r/o Jaitaran, PS Jaitaran, district- Pali; who is presently

undergoing sentence at Central Jail, Jodhpur as life convict;

claiming    permanent       parole        as   per   provisions      of    the

Rajasthan    Prisoners      (Release       On    Parole)     Rules,       1958

(herein after referred to as 'the Rules of 1958').


</p><p id="p_4">3)As per facts available on the record, the petitioner has

already served sentence for a term of 21 years 10 months

and 10 days including Jail remission for aperiod of 05 years

04 months, as on 25th October 2011. The State Level
         D.B. Cr. Parole Petition No.9780/<a href="/doc/200840/" id="a_2">2011- Pokar Ram v. State of Raj. &amp; ors</a>
                                                     judgment dt:08.11.2011

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                                                          2/3</span>

Committee in its meeting dated 22nd and 26 th July 2011

considered claim of the petitioner and rejected the same on

the ground that a negative report was given by District

Magistrate, Pali and Superintendent of Police, Pali. Both the

officers aforesaid have stated that release of the convict-

petitioner may cause endanger to peace and tranquility of

the society.
</p>
<p id="p_5">
</p><p id="p_6">4)It is not in dispute that the petitioner has benefited with

jail remission for a period of 05 years and 04 months and

he has served sentence for a term of 16 years 6 months

and 10 days. This shows that conduct of the petitioner is

quite normal in jail and such a person is not required to be

kept behind the bars for all times to come by denying him

permanent parole.
</p>
<p id="p_7">5)Need not to say that the object of the Rules of 1958 is to

rehabilitate the prisoners to bring him into main stream of

the society. While doing so, certain minor instances which

may have taken place while undergoing sentence can very

well be ignored. In the instant matter, we do not find any

such adverse material available with the respondents that

would have made the petitioner disentitled for grant of

permanent parole.
</p>
<p id="p_8">6)In DB Cr. Parole Writ Petition No.5152/2010, this Court

while emphasizing need of permanent parole as per Rules of

1958 ordered in following terms:
</p>
<p id="p_9">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">           "Cases      of   petitioners/prisoners          who     have
           served requisite period of sentence and are

                                                      judgment dt:08.11.2011

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                                                            3/3</span>

             eligible    for   consideration          for   release    on
             permanent parole under the provisions of the
             Rules of 1958, their cases may be considered
             by the respondents and if they are found
             eligible for grant of permanent parole, they
             be released on permanent parole irrespective
             of the fact whether petitioners have availed
             benefit of first, second or third parole or any
             of the above paroles."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_10"> 7)Having considered the totality of the facts of this petition,

 we   deem    it   appropriate         to    accept    this   petition      and

 accordingly, the same is allowed. The respondents are

 directed to release petitioner             Pokar Ram s/o Bachna Ram,

 by caste- Nai, r/o Jaitaran, PS Jaitaran, district- Pali; on

 permanent parole, by imposing adequate conditions, in

 accordance    with     the    Rules    of    1958.     The   petitioner      is

 required to be released on permanent parole within a period

 of two months from today.
