     THIS RFA IS FILED UNDER SEC. 96 OF CPC
AGAINST THE JUDGMENT AND DECREE DATED
25.03.2017 PASSED IN O.S. NO.199/2010 ON THE
FILE OF THE PRINCIPAL SENIOR CIVIL JUDGE AND
CHIEF     JUDICIAL   MAGISTRATE,    BELAGAVI,
DISMISSING THE SUIT FILED FOR PARTITION AND
SEPARATE POSSESSION.

     THIS APPEAL COMING ON FOR ADMISSION THIS
DAY, A.S.BOPANNA J., DELIVERED THE FOLLOWING:

                      JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">        The appellant is before this Court assailing the

judgment rendered on 25th March 2017 passed in OS

No.199 of 2010.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">        2. The appellant herein is the plaintiff in the said

suit.    The suit in question was filed for partition and

separate possession of the suit schedule properties. In

the said suit, the suit summons had been issued to the

defendants. The defendant Nos.1 to 3, 5, 7 and 8 had
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                              4</span>


remained ex parte′ while defendant Nos.4 and 6 had

appeared in the suit, only defendant No.6 had filed

written statement.    Pursuant to the same, the Court

below has framed as many as six issues for its

consideration and the suit had been set down for

evidence.    The plaintiff did not choose to adduce any

evidence and in that light, the defendants had also not

tendered evidence. The Court below, ultimately, by the

judgment dated 25th March 2017, has dismissed the

suit.
</p>
<p id="p_4">
</p><p id="p_5">        3. A perusal of the judgment passed by the Court

below    would   indicate   that   the   Court   below   has

proceeded on a wrong assumption as if the plaintiff had

not tendered himself for cross-examination, though at

certain places, he had not tendered evidence itself has

been recorded. Further, the nature of consideration as

made by answering the issues, indicates as if the Court

below instead of dismissing the suit for default has
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                             5</span>


proceeded to decide the right against the plaintiff which

is not appropriate.
</p>
<p id="p_6">
</p><p id="p_7">      4. In the instant appeal, in response to the notice

issued from this Court, the defendants, who were placed

ex parte′ before the Court below, have also entered

appearance, except defendant No.7 who is arrayed as

respondent No.6 herein.    Therefore, in a circumstance

as the defendants were not diligent in putting forth their

case before the Court below and also keeping in view

the circumstance that the plaintiff was a minor, being

represented through the guardian, has not proceeded

with the matter, it would be appropriate for this Court

to set aside the judgment and restore the suit for

consideration on merits after providing an opportunity

to all the parties.
</p>
<p id="p_8">
</p><p id="p_9">      5. As noticed, since the defendants who had been

placed ex parte′ before the Court below have appeared

pursuant to the notice issued from this Court, except
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                  6</span>


respondent No.6 herein who was arrayed as defendant

No.7    before   the     Court   below,    it    would   also    be

appropriate for this Court to direct the parties to appear

before the Court below on a date to be fixed herein and

at that stage, the Court below shall provide opportunity

to the defendants, who appear before it, to file their

written     statement,     consider   as        to   whether    any

additional issues are to be framed and thereafter,

proceed further in accordance with law.


</p><p id="p_10">       6. Insofar as the respondent No.6 herein, namely

the defendant No.7 before the Court below, the Court

below shall issue suit summons and thereafter, proceed

further in accordance with law. All contentions of the

parties are left open to be urged therein.


</p><p id="p_11">       7.   Accordingly, the judgment dated 25th March

2017 passed in O.S. No.199 of 2010 is set aside. The

suit in O.S. No.199 of 2010 is restored to the file of the

Principal Senior Civil Judge &amp; CJM, Belagavi.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                            7</span>



</p><p id="p_12">       The parties, who are represented herein, shall

appear before the Court below on 09th August 2017 as

the first date for appearance without issue of summons

from the Court below.
</p>
<p id="p_13">
</p><p id="p_14">       The Court below shall thereafter proceed further

in accordance with law in the manner as indicated

above.
</p>
<p id="p_15">
</p><p id="p_16">       The Registry to return the lower court record

forthwith. The appeal is accordingly allowed in part.
