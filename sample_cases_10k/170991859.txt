     (ARVIND @ LALLA @ ANAR SINGH Vs THE STATE OF MADHYA PRADESH THR)


20-12-2016</pre>

<p id="p_1">Shri Anil Kumar Mishra, Advocate for the applicant.
Shri Prakhar Dhengula, Panel Lawyer for the State.
With the consent of the parties, matter is heard finally.
This criminal revision has been preferred under <a href="/doc/1457888/" id="a_1">Section 397</a>, <a href="/doc/1571667/" id="a_2">401</a>
of Code of Criminal Procedure (for brevity, the '<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_3">CrPC</a>') against the
order dated 15.10.2016 passed by Additional Sessions Judge, Datia
in M.J.C.No.700126/2016, whereby the application filed by the
applicant under <a href="/doc/768169/" id="a_4">Section 451</a> read with <a href="/doc/239420/" id="a_5">Section 457</a> of CrPC for
releasing the tractor and trolley on Supurdiginame has been
rejected.
</p><p id="p_2">2. Brief facts of the case are that on 16.1.2016 the applicant was
transporting the sand in illegal manner. In the way at Police
Chowki Udi, District Datia, Assistant Sub-Inspector (ASI) B.S.Jadon
has made efforts to stop him, on which the applicant started
abusing him and did not stop and at the same time applicant fired
with gun at ASI B.S.Jadon, which was missed. In furtherance, it has
also been alleged that one Scorpio has also been damaged by the
applicant. On the basis of above facts, an FIR has been registered
at Crime No. 01/2016 by Police Station Pandokhar, District Datia
for the offence punishable under <a href="/doc/455468/" id="a_6">Sections 307</a>, <a href="/doc/1208971/" id="a_7">353</a>, <a href="/doc/1258372/" id="a_8">147</a>, <a href="/doc/763672/" id="a_9">148</a>, <a href="/doc/999134/" id="a_10">149</a>,
<a href="/doc/594493/" id="a_11">294</a>, <a href="/doc/175699/" id="a_12">336</a>, <a href="/doc/1440821/" id="a_13">332</a>, <a href="/doc/488479/" id="a_14">186</a> and <a href="/doc/180217/" id="a_15">506</a> of Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the
vehicle Tractor-Trolley Swaraj bearing registration No. MP-32-
AA-1210 involved in transportation of sand was seized by the
police. After completion of investigation, the charge sheet has
been filed.
</p><p id="p_3"> 3. The applicant has filed an application under <a href="/doc/513777/" id="a_16">Section 451</a> read
with <a href="/doc/1873755/" id="a_17">Section 457</a> before the trial Court for releasing the seized
tractor and trolley on Supurdiginama but the same was rejected by
impugned order. Being aggrieved by the order the applicant has
preferred this revision petition.
</p><p id="p_4">4. It is submitted by learned counsel for the applicant that the trial
Court has committed illegality in rejecting the application under
<a href="/doc/513777/" id="a_18">Section 451</a> read with <a href="/doc/239420/" id="a_19">Section 457</a> CrPC. The applicant is the
registered owner of the seized vehicle. The FIR does not disclose
that the vehicle has been seized on account of illegal
transportation. The vehicle is lying in the police station. The
applicant would be put to loss due to idleness of the vehicle,
therefore, the vehicle be released on interim custody to the
applicant.
</p><p id="p_5">5. The Trial Court rejected the application on the ground that the
vehicle in question is found to be involved in illegal extracting and
transporting the sand and as per the intimation, the proceeding for
confiscation of the vehicle is lying pending before the Mining
Officer, Datia. Therefore, the application for releasing the vehicle is
not maintainable before the Court.
</p><p id="p_6">6. As per the provision of Rule 53 (4) of M.P. Minor Mineral Rules,
1996 (for brevity, the "Rules of 1996"), the property so seized
under sub-Rule (2) may be released by the officer who seized such
property, on execution of a bond to the satisfaction of the officer
by the person from whose possession such property was seized
and on furnishing an undertaking that the vehicle shall be
produced at the time and at the place where such production is
asked for by such officer.
</p><p id="p_7"> 7. The proviso to rule 53 (4) speaks that where a report has been
made to the Magistrate under sub-rule (3) then the seized property
shall be released only under the orders of such Magistrate. It
appears from the impugned order of the trial Court that the report
has been made by the Collector to the Court that the seized
vehicle is liable to be confiscated and it has been forwarded to the
Mining Officer, Datia.
</p><p id="p_8">8. The applicant is a registered owner of the seized vehicle and it
is of no use to keep such seized vehicle at the police station for a
long period. Rule 53 of the Rules of 1996 does not restrict the
Magistrate or Court for giving the vehicle on interim custody to the
owner.
</p><p id="p_9">9. <a href="/doc/113232553/" id="a_20">In Sunderbhai Ambalal Desai vs. State of Gujrat</a>, (2002)
10 SCC 283, the Hon'ble Apex Court has held in para 17 as
under:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">        "In our view, whatever be the situation, it is of no use
        to keep such seized vehicles at the police stations for a
        long period. It is for the Magistrate to pass appropriate
        orders immediately by taking appropriate bond and
        guarantee as well as security for return of the said
        vehicles, if required at any point of time. This can be
        done pending hearing of applications for return of such
        vehicles. "
</blockquote><p id="p_10">10. Looking to the facts of the case and in the light of the
observations made in the case of Sunderbhai Ambalal Desai
(supra), the revision petition deserves to be allowed and it is
directed that if the applicant submits a bond before the trial Court
in the sum of Rs.10,00,000/- (Rupees Ten Lacs only) with a solvent
surety in the like amount, along with an undertaking that he will
not make any change in the appearance of the vehicle and shall
produce the vehicle before the trial Court as well as Mining Officer
 as and when demanded, on his own cost and also shall not create
third party rights then the vehicle (Tractor-Trolley Swaraj bearing
registration No. MP-32-AA-1210) be given to the applicant on
supurdiginame till the disposal of the case.
The revision petition stands disposed of.
