ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">1.                      This is an appeal under <a href="/doc/1933289/" id="a_1">section 29</a> of Protection of
Women from <a href="/doc/542601/" id="a_2">Domestic Violence Act</a>, 2005 (hereinafter called "<a href="/doc/542601/" id="a_3">The
Act</a>") against the impugned order dated 05.10.2009 passed by the
court of Ms. Smita Garg, Metropolitan Magistrate. Notice of the
appeal was given to the respondent Shradha Kumar. Trial court
record was summoned and arguments have been heard.
</p>

<p id="p_2">2.                      Respondent had filed a complaint u/s 12 of <a href="/doc/542601/" id="a_4">The Act</a>
against her husband and her in-laws. Appellant is the husband of
respondent.                Respondent filed reply to the complaint.        Ld.
</p>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">Crl. Appeal No. 37/09                                              Page 1 of 6</span>
<p id="p_3"> Metropolitan Magistrate vide her order dated 05-10-2009 disposed
off the complaint by directing the appellant to compensate the
respondent in the sum of Rs. 75,000/- and also directed him to pay
a sum of Rs. 13,000/- per month to the respondent towards
maintenance w.e.f. date of filing of complaint i.e. 14-08-2008. It is
this order which has been challenged in appeal before this Court.
</p>

<p id="p_4">3.                      Ld.   counsel   of   appellant   has   made    three-fold
submissions firstly that respondent has concealed that she is
having           sufficient      independent    income;    secondly    that   Ld.
Metropolitan Magistrate did not follow the procedures provided
under the Code of Criminal procedure as no opportunity was
granted to the appellant to lead evidence on disputed issues and
thirdly that respondent is living in adultery.                 Ld. Counsel of
respondent has argued that u/s 28 (2) of the Act, the Court has the
power to lay down its own procedures for the disposal of the
application u/s 12 or Sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/207919/" id="a_5">Section 23</a> and therefore
there is no merit in the appeal. It is also submitted that there is no
evidence that respondent is having any source of income or that
she is living in adultery and that appellant has made wild
allegations only with a view to delay the execution of the orders
passed by Ld. MM.
</p>

<p id="p_5">4.                      During the pendency of the appeal, appellant filed an
application seeking permission to place on record additional

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">Crl. Appeal No. 37/09                                                 Page 2 of 6</span>
 documents. It has been submitted that during the pendency of the
appeal, appellant has come to know that respondent worked with
Jaypee Vasant Continental Hotel, New Delhi from August 2008 to
July 2009 as Executive Admin and Front office and this fact was
concealed by her. It is also stated that respondent is presently
working with M/s Casses India Pvt. Ltd at Gurgaon as Manager,
Business Development and reporting to Director, Sales and
Marketing Sh. Sanjeev Kapoor and is drawing a handsome salary
of Rs. 32,000/- per month. It is also stated in the application that
respondent is living in adulterous relationship with said Sanjeev
Kapoor and stayed with him at Ramee Guestline Hotel, Khar,
Mumbai.                 Ld. Counsel of appellant has argued that adulterous
relationship of respondent with her employer Sanjeev Kapoor can
further be corroborated from phone call details of respondent. It
has been stated that out of 1309 calls made from the mobile
phones of respondent, 356 calls including incoming/outgoing and
SMSs were exchanged with Sanjeev Kapoor during the period 25-
02-2009 to 05-01-2011. It is also submitted that out of 6990 calls
including incoming, outgoing and SMSs during the period 01-10-
2009 to 18-12-2009 from the mobile phones of Sanjeev Kapoor,
1458 calls were exchanged between the respondent and Sanjeev
Kapoor on the two mobile phones of respondent, one of which is
registered in the name of Sanjeev Kapoor and gifted to respondent.
It is argued that Trial Court had not granted any opportunity to the
appellant to lead evidence. Had the opportunity been granted, the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">Crl. Appeal No. 37/09                                            Page 3 of 6</span>
 impugned order dated 05-10-2009 would have never been passed
by Ld. Trial Court. Along with application, appellant has filed copy
of Curriculum Vitae of the respondent to show that she had work
experience at Jaypee Vasant Continental Hotel, New Delhi, copy of
employment contract with M/s Casses India Pvt. Ltd., copy of e-
mail dated 12-08-2009 sent by respondent to Humphrey Dubrown
admitting the fact that she had worked with Jaypee Vasant
Continental Hotel, New Delhi. The appellant has also filed copy of
schedule for job interview with M/s Casses India Pvt Ltd and the
congratulatory mail sent by Sanjeev Kapoor on her selection as
Manager, Business Development in M/s Casses India Pvt. Ltd.
The appellant has also filed copy of mail asking the respondent to
visit the office of the company for completing HR formalities and
signing the job contract. There is also one e-mail of respondent
that she had joined the company M/s Casses India Pvt. Ltd. The
other documents filed with application are call details and some
photographs allegedly of the respondent and Sanjeev Kapoor and
a DVD to prove that respondent was having intimate relationship
with Sanjeev Kapoor.
</p>

<p id="p_6">5.                      Ld. advocate of respondent has argued that none of the
documents which are sought to be filed is an authenticated
document.                The documents are in text format and not in PDF
format and therefore their authenticity and genuineness is doubtful.
It is also argued that source of documents is not disclosed and

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">Crl. Appeal No. 37/09                                              Page 4 of 6</span>
 even the call details are not authenticated. It is further submitted
that all the documents are manipulated and fabricated and
therefore appellant cannot be granted permission to file said
documents.                Ld. counsel of the appellant further argues that
documents have been downloaded from e-mail account of
respondent and therefore there is no doubt regarding their
genuineness.
</p>

<p id="p_7">6.                      Under <a href="/doc/782148/" id="a_6">Section 391</a> Cr. P. C. the appellate court is
empowered, if it thinks that additional evidence is necessary to
record its reasons and take such evidence by itself or direct it to be
taken by the lower court. The appellant wants to file documents
with a view to prove that respondent is gainfully employed and has
sufficient means for her maintenance. There is no room for doubt
that the documents sought to be filed are relevant for the purpose
of adjudication of the case, if they are found to be genuine. Under
these circumstances, the refusal to grant permission to appellant to
file the documents would result in miscarriage of justice.                I
therefore find it appropriate to set aside the order dated 05-10-
2009 passed by the Ld. Metropolitan Magistrate and remand back
the case to Ld. Metropolitan Magistrate with directions to take the
documents on record and to consider the matter afresh in the light
of documents filed by the appellant, after granting liberty to the
parties to lead evidence to prove or disprove the authenticity and
genuineness of the documents so filed. The appeal is accordingly

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">Crl. Appeal No. 37/09                                           Page 5 of 6</span>
 allowed. The Trial Court Record complete in all respects be sent
back with a copy of this order to Concerned Court.           Parties to
appear before concerned court on 24-04-2010.             Appeal file be
consigned to Record Room.
