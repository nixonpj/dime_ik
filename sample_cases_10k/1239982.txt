ORAL
ORDER</pre> 

 

<p id="p_1">(Per
: HONOURABLE MR.JUSTICE D.H.WAGHELA)
 

 


 


</p><p id="p_2">1.	The
petitioner is aggrieved by the supposed decision of the respondent to
disqualify the tender of the petitioner. Admittedly, the petitioner
had submitted his tender online for hiring of security and
surveillance services by the respondent. The date for pre-bid
conference was 24.12.2010 and the date for closing of tender, as
stated in the petition, was 21.01.2011. The petitioner having
disclosed some information about pendency of criminal case against
one of its directors, the respondent had written a letter dated
15.02.2011 to the petitioner seeking information and documents. There
is no dispute about the fact that one of the essential conditions
contained in the tender document read as under:
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_3">	"2.6
: There should not be any conviction, criminal  case pending
investigation, inquiry or trial against the proprietor/firm or
partners. This information has to be submitted alongwith the tender
in the form of an affidavit duly signed before authorized Notary
Public, failing which the bid will be rejected. In case, the
information is found false at any stage, ONGC reserves the right to
(I) reject the tender and/or forfeit his EMD (ii) terminate the
contract awarded to such Contractor/Agency and forfeit his SD."
</p> 


 


 

 


 


<p id="p_4">2.	The
petitioner has also admitted that a criminal case is registered at
Chandkheda Police Station, Ahmedabad, vide C.R No. 3058 of 2010 dated
07.07.2010 wherein a Director of the petitioner is named as one of
the accused persons, and the offences alleged against the accused
include offences punishable under <a href="/doc/1011035/" id="a_1">Sections 323</a>, <a href="/doc/1198799/" id="a_2">294(b)</a>, <a href="/doc/180217/" id="a_3">506(2)</a> and
<a href="/doc/112749/" id="a_4">114</a> of IPC and under <a href="/doc/1507082/" id="a_5">Section 3</a>.1.10 of the Scheduled Castes and <a href="/doc/25085007/" id="a_6">The
Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act</a>, 1989.
</p> 

 


 


<p id="p_5">3.	In
the above facts, the argument for the petitioner was that, even as
the criminal case was registered against the petitioner, as
aforesaid, the petitioner has approached this Court, by way of
Criminal Misc. Application No. 8678 of 2010, under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_7">Section 482</a> of the
Code of Criminal Procedure with the prayer to quash the FIR
registered as C.R. No. 3058 of 2010. It was further pointed out by
learned counsel, Mr. Raval, that learned Single Judge of this Court
has, by order dated 06.09.2010, granted ad interim relief staying
further investigation of the aforesaid FIR. It was on that basis
argued, without support of any precedent or provision, that pendency
of the criminal case ought to have been ignored by the respondent and
the petitioner's price-bid ought to have been opened by the
respondent in their own interest. It is, however, not the
petitioner's case that their bid is the lowest among all the bidders.
</p> 

 


 


<p id="p_6">4.	Having
regard to the express condition contained in the tender as regards
pendency of any criminal case and confirmation by the petitioner
about the pendency, the only question required to be considered is
whether the order of this Court granting ad interim stay against
further investigation of the FIR would operate to nullify the
pendency of the criminal case pending against the Director of the
petitioner. It may be pertinent to note here that the petitioner has
not cared to disclose full and correct information about subsequent
proceeding and orders in Criminal Misc. Application No. 8678 of 2010
which is only stated to be still pending. Instead, it was sought to
be argued that the original complaint was motivated and frivolous,
and therefore, further investigation was stayed by the aforesaid
order of this Court. Obviously, this Court cannot go into or express
any opinion about the other petition of the petitioner which is
pending before another Court. Therefore, the only fact which could be
pressed in service is the order granting ad interim relief on
06.09.2010 which can hardly be construed as absence of pendency of a
criminal case pending at the investigation stage. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_7">5.	Therefore,
the arguments and the only contention of the petitioner could  not be
accepted in the overall facts and circumstances briefly narrated
hereinabove. Accordingly, the petition is summarily dismissed.
