</pre><p id="p_4">         3.      Learned advocate for the petitioners submitted that the petitions
         involving similar facts and identical issue containing the similar prayer,
         came to be decided by common judgment dated 05.07.2016 in
         <a href="/doc/161604592/" id="a_1">Nitinkumar C. Patel vs. State of Gujarat</a> being Special Civil
         Application NO. 1791 of 2007 and other allied matters. Learned
         Assistant Government Pleader accepted the position that the present
         matter as well as those decided cases are similar and further that the said
         common judgment would apply to the case of the present petitioners also.
</p>

<p id="p_5">         4.      Relevant portions from the aforementioned common judgment in
         Nitinkumar C. Patel (supra) may be reproduced for ready reference,

              31 The petitioners, in the present proceedings, are seeking directions for payment of the
              H.R.A. and C.L.A. as per the circular of the State Government. In this regard, the case of
              the State Government, according to the existing policy, is that the cities are classified
              under the urban agglomeration, by which, a government, employee would be entitled for
              the H.R.A. and C.L.A. In this regard, those cities not falling under the classified urban
              agglomeration would not get any benefit of the H.R.A. and C.L.A. It is submitted that the
              cities, which are not falling under the radius of the eight kilometers, would not be
              qualified in the urban agglomeration.
</p>
<p id="p_6">              32 On behalf of the State Government, it is submitted that the cities are classified into the
              different categories and based on the classification of cities under the different
              categories, the payment of the H.R.A. and C.L.A. would be decided. Therefore is no
              provision in the policy of the State Government for making up and down and that the
              writ applicants are required to stay at the place of occupation.
</p>
<p id="p_7">              33 On behalf of the State Government, it is submitted that a huge burden to the public
              exchequer would follow once the payments of H.R.A. and C.L.A. are increased. Even
              though the writ applicants have produced undertakings on record, it would be difficult
              for the respondents State to decide the entitlement of each of the Teachers as many have
              retired.
</p>
<p id="p_8">              34. &amp;..
</p>
<p id="p_9">              35 In the course of the hearing of the matters, it was suggested on behalf of the State
              Government that the entire issue may be asked to be looked into by a High Power
              Committee that the State Government may constitute. All the learned counsel appearing
              for the writ applicants agreed to this and submitted that six or seven persons amongst the
              writ applicants shall appear before the committee for the purpose of submissions and
              they will also file written representation in this regard with the necessary materials. I am
              also of the opinion that the State Government will have to reconsider the entire issue a
              fresh, more particularly, in the wake of the recent developments, and for that purpose, the

         decision of the State Government, to constitute a High Power Committee, appears to be
         quite just and proper. I could have adjudicated the controversy on merits without
         referring the issue for being considered by a High Power Committee, but as the State
         Government itself wants to have a re-look or reconsider the issue in the wake of
         subsequent developments, then I should permit the State Government to adopt the course
         of action they have proposed.
