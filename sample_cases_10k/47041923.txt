FOLLOWING:

                       JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">     There is a delay of 469 days in filing the appeals. IA.II of

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                      3</span>


through the reasons assigned in the accompanying affidavit and

also heard the learned counsel for the respondents and gone

through the reasons assigned in the affidavit.          Having satisfied

with the reasons assigned, IA.II of 2015 is allowed.              Delay of

469 days in filing the appeals is condoned.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">      2. Appellants herein were the petitioners in Writ Petitions

No.8953 of 2011 and 17975 of 2009.              It is claimed that the

petitioners   are   the    owners    of   the   lands   bearing     Survey

No.98/1p1 measuring 2 acre 45 cents and in Survey No.95/3p1

measuring 1 acre 44 cents of Chelur village, Bantwal Taluk,

Dakshina Kannada District.          The lands were acquired by the

Karnataka     Industrial   Areas    Development     Board    (for    short

hereinafter referred to as 'the KIADB') by issuing notifications.

On filing objections by the owners of the lands proposed to be

acquired, the cases of the owners whose lands are in low-lying

areas, have been dropped.           It is their further case that the

adjoining lands which are in low-lying areas have been dropped,

whereas the appellants lands which are also in the low-lying area

have been included in the notification for the purpose of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                   4</span>


acquisition.   The   appellants   have   filed objections   to the

competent authority requesting not to acquire the lands since

their lands also come under low-lying areas. The objections of

the appellants have not been considered. Hence, the appellants

have approached this Court in the said writ petitions. In order to

substantiate the case of the petitioner/appellants, this Court

directed the KIADB to make a report and pursuant to the said

order, the report was filed on 16th November, 2012. Having not

satisfied with the said report, it was directed to file a further

report. Accordingly, further report was filed on 04th December

2013.   As per the said report, out of the 6.93 acres of lands

acquired in pre-notification in Survey No.98/1p1, the extent of

land acquired in respect of the petitioner/appellant is 0.83 cents.

In the remark column of the report it is stated that 0.83 acres is

proposed to be acquired, 0.10 acres falls in the low-lying area.

Hence, it is submitted that as per this report also the

petitioner/appellant is entitled for the relief of dropping the said

area from acquisition.    The learned counsel for the appellant

submits that the action of the respondent in dropping the

acquisition of adjoining lands on the ground of low-lying area
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                  5</span>


and acquiring the land of the petitioner/appellants, though it is

also in the low-lying area, is in violative and arbitrary on the part

of the respondents. In support of his case, the learned counsel

has referred to the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in

the case of <a href="/doc/337173/" id="a_1">BEML EMPLOYEES HOUSE BUILDING CO-OPERATIVE

SOCIETY LIMITED v. STATE OF KARNATAKA AND OTHERS</a>

reported in (2005)9 SCC 248 and referred to paragraph 7 of the

judgment. It is his submission that the Hon'ble Supreme Court

has observed that, similarly situated extent of lands, if it is not

considered for the purpose of dropping, the acquisition is nothing

but violation of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_2">Article 14</a> of the Constitution of India and it

amounts to vice and hostile discrimination infects and vitiates

the decision taken by the State Government to continue with the

acquisition.
</p>
<p id="p_4">
</p><p id="p_5">      3. On the other hand, the learned Counsel appearing for

KIADB submits that what was dropped, may not be for the

reason it is out of compact area.      In case, if the land of the

petitioner-appellants to the extent which it is said is in the low-

lying area, if it is dropped it affects the principle of compactness
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                   6</span>


for the purpose for which it was acquired. He submits that the

case of the appellants has been rightly considered by the learned

single Judge and dropped the proceedings.             Hence, these

appeals are also to be dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_6">
</p><p id="p_7">      4.     The learned Government Advocate also submits to

dismiss these appeals and it is his submission that the Authority

which is competent to drop or acquire is KIADB and under the

circumstances, it is not for this Court to interfere in the matter.


</p><p id="p_8">      5.   Heard the learned counsel for the parties.      From the

submissions made by the learned counsel appearing for the

appellants and also on the basis of the sketch placed before us,

we have seen that some of the lands have been dropped on the

ground that they fall under low-lying area.      The sketch further

goes to show that the petitioner-appellants land is also in the

low-lying area and the same is again supported by the report

submitted.     This Court, also finds that the land in Survey

No.98/1p1 which is in an extent of 0.10 acres, is a low-lying

area. When it is held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court that a patch

of land, if it is dropped on the ground that the land falls in the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                     7</span>


low-lying area, similar benefit is necessarily to be extended to

the adjoining lands, if it comes within the same parameters.

Whether it falls in the low-lying area or not, is for the

respondent-KIADB to assign reasons. It is not open for KIADB

to acquire or drop, if the land situates in the same parameters.

If KIADB had dropped the lands adjoining to the land of the

appellants, then the same benefit is to be extended to the other

lands which are also in the low-lying area.       The same has not

been done in the case of the appellants, as we have seen from

the Report and also the sketch made available to us.           Under

these circumstances, as already held by the Hon'ble Supreme

Court, we hold that the action of the respondent-KIADB is

arbitrary, in case, it has not extended the same benefit to the

appellants.    For the said purpose, instead of declaring that the

land of the appellants comes within the low-lying area or not, it

is   better   to   direct   the   respondent-KIADB,   which   is   the

appropriate authority, to consider the case of the appellants and

pass appropriate orders.      It is also directed that while disposing

of the matter, the report submitted to this Court, which is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                 8</span>


extracted in the judgment of the learned Single Judge at internal

paragraph No.3 is to be taken into consideration.


</p><p id="p_9">      With these observations appeals stand disposed of.
