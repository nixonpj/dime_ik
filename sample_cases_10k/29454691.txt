 IN THE COURT OF Ms. VEENA RANI, ADDITIONAL SENIOR 
    CIVIL JUDGE, SOUTH­EAST DISTRICT, SAKET COURT 
                       COMPLEX, NEW DELHI
Rajeev Gulati       Vs.            Ramesh Kumar Rakheja
Suit No:364/2013
02­01­2014
Present:       Counsel for the plaintiff. 
</p><p id="p_2">               Counsel for the defendant. 
</p><p id="p_3">               Today   the   case   is   fixed   for   order   on   the 
application of the plaintiff u/o 26 rule 9 r/w Section 151 CPC 
for the appointment of the Local Commissioner. 
</p><p id="p_4">               It is submitted by the plaintiff that in his written 
statement   the   defendant     has   alleged   that   there   are   four 
tenancies for portions marked A,B,C &amp; D in the site plan filed 
by the defendant along with the written statement  and total 
area   in   possession   of   the   defendant   under   above   said   four 
portions A,B,C and D comes to 577.50 sq ft. which has been 
marked   by   the   defendant   in   his   site   plan.     It   is   further 
submitted by the plaintiff that   in the site plan submitted by 
the defendant, while the areas of Portions A,B &amp; D have been 
mentioned   by   him   in   the   coloured   area   marked   for   the 
respective portions, however, no area has been mentioned  by 


 Suit No:364/13  Rajeev Gulati   Vs.  Ramesh Kumar Rakheja
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                        2</span>

the   defendant   in   respect   of   portion   C   malafidely   and 
fraudulently because the area of Portion C has been  stated to 
be ad­measuring   127.50 sq. ft. but   in the site plan of the 
defendant   that   total   area   of   Portion   Ca   has   been   shown   in 
green colour which comes to 650.00 sq. ft.  It is stated that in 
order to create a false defense to the suit, the defendant has 
submitted a false and frivolous statement  in the court that he 
is in possession of total area of 577.50 sq. ft., while actually 
defendant is in possession of about 1100 sq. ft area as stated 
by the plaintiff in his plaint.   It is further stated that in order 
to verify   and ascertain the actual total area in possession of 
the   defendant   pursuant   to   above   alleged   for   tenancies   vide 
portions A,B,C &amp; D it is necessary that a Local Commissioner 
be appointed in order to ascertain the above said facts. 
</p><p id="p_5">       In their reply to the above application the defendant has 
submitted   that   nowhere     in   his   written   statement   he   has 
denied that the suit property is not 1100 sq. ft, in fact he has 
filed the various Rent Agreements which were executed by the 
late   father   of   the   plaintiff   in   favour   of   the   dependent   vide 
which different portions of the suit property were let out by 
the father of the plaintiff to the defendant.  It is stated that the 
plaintiff has nowhere denied the executions of the said rent 


 Suit No:364/13  Rajeev Gulati   Vs.  Ramesh Kumar Rakheja
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                        3</span>

agreements   between   the   father   of   the   plaintiff   and   the 
defendant.  It is submitted by the defendant that the portion C 
is   of   such   dimensions   that   it   is   difficult   to   show   the   area 
reserved in the Lease Deed on the site plan.   It is denied by 
the defendant that he has stated that he is in possession of 
total area of 577.50 sq. ft.  It is stated by the defendant that it 
is   not   denied that defendant is in possession of a total of 
1100 sq. ft but the same was let out to the defendant by way 
of   four   separate   lease   deeds.     It   is   submitted   that   the 
application of the plaintiff is devoid of merits and there is no 
need   to   verify   the   actual   total   area   in   possession   of   the 
defendant   since   it   is   an   admitted   position   that   the   suit 
property is ad­measuring 1100 sq. yards. 
</p><p id="p_6">        Heard. File perused. 
</p><p id="p_7">        In his plaint in para no:2 the plaintiff has stated that 
defendant was inducted as tenant in the part of the ground 
floor   portion   of   the   property  bearing  No:F­17,   Kalkaji,   New 
Delhi­19 having covered area of about 1100 sq ft. along with 
the   facility   of   independent   bath/W.C   with   common   water 
drainage system on a monthly rent of Rs.1700/­ w.e.f. January 
1987.  This fact that defendant is in possession of a total area 
of 1100 sq. ft. is not denied by the defendant rather it is stated 


 Suit No:364/13  Rajeev Gulati   Vs.  Ramesh Kumar Rakheja
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                      4</span>

by the defendant that same was let out to him by way of four 
separate leases which continues till date. It is an admitted fact 
that   defendant   was   inducted   as   tenant   in   the   part   of   the 
ground floor portion of the property bearing No:F­17, Kalkaji, 
New Delhi­19 having covered area of about 1100 sq ft.
</p><p id="p_8">       The   plaintiff   has   filed   the   present   suit   against   the 
defendant for the recovery of possession, recovery of arrears 
of rent and mesne profits/damages.  The plaintiff has to prove 
his case and to stands on its own legs. The court is not meant 
to create evidence in favour of any parties.  I find no merits in 
the application of the plaintiff. Hence, same is dismissed.

8­2­2014.
