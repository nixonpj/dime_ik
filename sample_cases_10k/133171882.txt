v.



The Commercial Tax Officer,

	Writ Petition filed under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_2">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India to issue a Writ of certiorari, to call for  the records on the file of the respondent in his impugned proceedings made in TIN No.33254321886/2012-13, dated 26.05.2015  quash the same as illegal and contrary to the scheme of the Act.

		For Petitioner          : Ms.R.Hemalatha
		For Respondents	 : Mr.S.Manoharan Sundaram							   Addl. Govt. Pleader (Taxes)					  

O R D E R
</pre><p id="p_1">	Heard  Ms.R.Hemalatha, learned counsel for the petitioner and Mr.S.Manohar Sundaram, learned Additional Government Pleader (Taxes).
</p>
<p id="p_2">	2. This writ petition has been filed by M/s.Bombay Light House,      represented by its Partner viz., Mr.K.Umesh,   challenging   the impugned proceedings of the 1st  respondent in TIN No.33254321886/2012-13, dated 26.05.2015 and to quash the same  as illegal and contrary to the scheme of the  Tamil Nadu Value Added Tax Act 2006 (hereinafter referred to as TNVAT Act).
</p>
<p id="p_3">	3.  The learned counsel for the petitioner  submitted that the petitioner is a   dealer in Electrical &amp; Electronics items  and registered  on the file of the   respondent under the provisions of the TNVAT Act.  For the year 2012-13, the  petitioner hasd filed Form I returns reporting a total and taxable turnover of Rs.5,83,08,544/- and claimed ITC for Rs.69,00,337/-.   The learned counsel further submitted that the respondent has issued a notice  stating that few purchases were not  reported by the seller and in  the absence of  sales details of other end, the ITC claimed and adjusted towards output tax become ineligible  and hence, the respondent has proposed to revise the assessment for the year 2012-13.  In response to the said notice, the petitioner  filed  objections stating that the suppliers have issued valid tax invoice  and the copies of the  same has been filed.  Therefore,    the claim of ITC is in order on the basis of original tax invoice issued by the suppliers as provided under section 19(10)(c) of the TNVAT Act.  However, the respondent had passed the impugned order on 26.05.2015, without considering the said objections filed.  Aggrieved over the same, the petitioner is before this Court.  
</p>
<p id="p_4">	4.    The learned counsel for the petitioner  submitted  that on receipt of the  notice, the petitioner  filed  preliminary reply enclosing xerox copies of the invoices with an undertaking to produce the originals.  Thereafter, nothing moved on and the impugned order, against the principles of natural justice came to be passed on 26.05.2015. Hence, the counsel sought for setting aside of the impugned order of assessment.  
</p>
<p id="p_5">	5.  Though various grounds have been raised on merits against the impugned order,  the main ground of attack in this case is non consideration of the  preliminary reply enclosing xerox copies of the invoices with an undertaking to produce the originals as and when required.   The petitioner to show the  bona fide, filed  xerox copies of the invoices and awaited further communication from the respondent.  But, without  giving any opportunity to the petitioner for producing the originals, the impugned order came to be passed, which is unsustainable.    Hence, on this score alone, the impugned order is liable to be set aside.
</p>	 
 	
<p id="p_6">	6.  In the result, the impugned order passed by the   respondent in TIN No.33254321886/2012-13, dated 26.05.2015   is set aside and the matter is remitted back to the assessing authority for fresh consideration.  The petitioner shall file the original invoices, within a period of two weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of this order and on such filing, the authority concerned shall consider the same  and pass appropriate orders on merits and in accordance with law, within a period of six weeks thereafter, after affording an opportunity of personal hearing to the petitioner.  If the petitioner fails to comply any of the directions, it is open to the respondent to pass appropriate orders.  
</p>	
<p id="p_7">	The writ petition is disposed of accordingly. No costs. Consequently, connected miscellaneous petitions are closed.
