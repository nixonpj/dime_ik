<p id="p_29">28.           ld. Counsel for the State has contended that accused 
has been identified by PW­2 Mithlesh Jha as one of the accused 
persons who after causing injuries to him with knife   and fire 
arms robbed him of his vehicle and testimony of this witness is 
supported by medical evidence as well as by police official.  Ld. 
Counsel for the state has contended that  the accused alongwith 
his co accused who are still absconding  had attacked the victim 
PW2     Mithlesh   Jha   and   robbed   him   of   his     Tavera   vehicle 
bearing no.  DL ­IVB­5137 after causing  him injuries  which was 
dangerous   to   life and in view of the impeccable evidence   of 
PW2   Mithlesh Jha, accused deserves to be convicted.

contended   that   PW­2   Mithlesh   Jha   has   failed   to   identify   the 
accused and he was declared hostile and, otherwise also, case of 
prosecution is full of material contradictions and discrepancies 
which prosecution has failed to explain and which makes the 
prosecution story highly improbable and there is no evidence 
on record to connect the accused with the alleged offence.  PW2

co accused has committed robbery on the victim  PW2  by using 
deadly weapon and  also  attempted  to commit murder of PW2. 
In this regard,  I would like to discuss the testimony of PW2  Sh. 
Mithlesh  Jha  who  has deposed that on 10.5.09 in the night, he 
was   going     in     vehicle   no.     DL   ­IVB­5137   to   Gurgaon   from 
Nangloi   and he was   employed     in the said   vehicle as driver 
and the said vehicle  is  owned and possessed  by PW1 and when 
at   about   11.45   p.m,   he   reached   near     Reliance     Petrol   Pump, 
Jhatikra Road , he saw  that one person  was going  on  the road, 
who appeared  to in state of  intoxication and in order to  avoid 
the said person, PW2  took his vehicle on the left side of the road 
at slow   speed   and when   the said   vehicle   reached near   the 
aforesaid person / accused. Accused assaulted him on  his head 
with a knife   in the moving   vehicle   and as a result of   which 
darkness   appeared   in   front   of   his   eyes   and   he   stopped   the 
vehicle and  as soon as he  regained his consciousness   he found 
that   one of the accused has pointed   out   pistol towards   him

Mukesh after entering into vehicle  hit him  on his stomach and 
chest with  a knife  and thereafter, gave seven knife blows on his 
head and six knife  blows  on  his stomach and when PW2  was 
trying   to   prevent  injury   being  inflicted  on  him  from accused,

knife blows on his hand and he  caused cut in his vein  near his

that of accused Mukesh but all the accused has thrown him out

persons     who   were   standing   outside     the   vehicle     joined   the

legs in between the door of the vehicle upon which  he was left

inflicted on his person. He further  admitted that he has gone to 
attend the  proceeding at Tihar Jail  but  photographs  of accused 
were shown  to him before  holding TIP.

inflicting stab injury. PW2 Mithlesh   Jha has also identified the 
accused in the court as one   of the accused as the person who 
had   robbed     him   after   causing   stabbed   injury.       There   is 
consistency  in the statement of the victim and the  victim PW2 
has also identified  accused Mukesh  as  one of the perpetrator 
of   the   crime   committed     upon   PW2.       I   find   no   force   in   the 
contention of the Ld. Counsel for the  accused  that testimony of 
PW2   is full of material contradictions and   vital discrepancies 
which  caused dent in the story of the prosecution and I did not 
observe   any   such contradiction/ discrepancy nor   any   such 
contradiction   or   discrepancy       has   pointed   out   by   the   Ld. 
Counsel for the accused in the testimony of PW2  except the sole 
alleged contradiction that PW2  has  turned  hostile  in his cross 
examination conducted on 30.9.2013   but said contradiction is 
neither   here   nor     there   as   I   found   no   substance   in   the 
contention of the defence counsel that PW­2 has testified in his 
cross   examination   on   being   summoned   under   <a href="/doc/1780550/" id="a_13">section   311</a> 
CR.PC that he could not see the accused persons on account of 
darkness   and   he   was   declared   hostile     and   therefore,   his 
testimony is not reliable and no conviction can be recorded on 
his testimony as law is well settled that testimony of a hostile 
witness can be relied upon which support the prosecution story.

              State of Karnataka, [1980] 1 SCR 95 that the 
              evidence of a prosecution witness cannot be 
              rejected   in   toto   merely   because   the 
              prosecution   chose   to   treat   him   as   hostile 
              and   crossexamined   him.   The   evidence   of 
              such witness­ es cannot be treated as effaced 
              or washed off the record altogether but the 
              same   can   be   accepted   to   the   extent   their 
              version   is   found   to   be   dependable   on   a 
              careful scrutiny thereof. In the present case 
              the   evidence   of   the   aforesaid   two   eye­
              witnesses was challenged by the prosecution 
              in   cross­examination   because   they   refused 
              to   name   the   accused   in   the   dock   as   the 
              assailants   of   the   deceased.   We   are   in 
              agreement   with   the   submission   of   the 
              learned   counsel   for   the   State   that   the   trial 
              court   made   no   effort   to   scrutinise   the 
              evidence   of   these   two   witnesses   even   in 
              regard   to   the   factum  of   the  incident.  On   a 
              careful   consideration   of   their   evi­   dence   it 
              becomes   crystal   clear   that   PW   4   had

              incident   that   occurred   at   the   location 
              pointed   out   by   the   prosecution,   PW   4 
              sustained   an   injury.   His   presence   in   the 
              company   of   the   deceased   at   the   place   of 
              occurrence, there­ fore, cannot be doubted. 
              Immediately   after   the   incident   within   less 
              than an hour thereof PW 4 went to the police 
              station   and   lodged   the   first   information 
              report.   It   is   true   that   the   first   information 
              report is not substantive evi­ dence but the 
              fact remains that immediately after the inci­ 
              dent   and   before   there   was   any   extraneous 
              intervention PW 4 went to the police station 
              and   narrated   the   incident.   The   first 
              information   report   is   a   detailed   document 
              and   it   is   not   possible   to   believe   that   the 
              investigating   officer   imagined   those   details 
              and   prepared   the   document   Exh.   P   3.  The 
              detailed narration about the incident in the

              some   fertile   thinking   on   the   part.     Of   the 
              investigating officer. We are satisfied, beyond 
              any manner of doubt, that PW 4 had gone to 
              the   police   station   and   had   lodged   the   first

              been   contradicted   with   the   facts   stated   in 
              the   first   information   report   shows   that   he 
              has   tried   to   resile   from   his   earlier   version 
              regarding the incident. So also the presence 
              of PW 3 at the scene of occurrence cannot be 
              doubt­   ed   once   the   presence   of   PW   4   is

              them   Gopal   struck   PW   4  with   a   chain.  He 
              also stated that the appellant Khujji and his

              with knives and when Khujji tried to assault 
              PW 4 with a knife, Gopal shouted Khujji that

              him and hence he could not see their faces 
              while he could identify the remaining four 
              persons. He stated that he had inferred that 
              the   other   two   persons   were   the   appellant 
              and Gudda. On the basis of this statement 
              Mr.Lalit   submitted   that   the   evidence 
              regarding   the   identity   of   the   appellant   is 
              rendered   highly   doubtful   and   it   would   be 
              hazardous to convict the appellant solely on 
              the   basis   of   identification   by   such   a 
              wavering witness. The High Court came to 
              the conclusion and, in our opinion rightly, 
              that   during   the   one   month   period   that 
              elapsed   since   the   recording   of   his 
              examination­in­chief   something   transpired 
              which made  him shift his evidence on the 
              question of identi­ ty to help the appellant. 
              We   are   satisfied   on   a   reading   of   his   entire 
              evidence   that   his   statement   in   cross­
              examination on the question of identity of 
              the appellant and his compan­ ion is a clear 
              attempt to wriggle out of what he had stated 
              earlier in his examination­in­chief.

evaluated on the touch stone of consistency. Consistency is the 
key word for convicting the accused persons. In a criminal trial 
evidence  of the eye witnesses require a careful assessment and 
must   be   evaluated   for   its   credibility   since   the   fundamental 
aspect   of   criminal   jurisprudence   rests   upon   the   stated 
principles   that   "no   man   is   guilty   unless   proven   so"     hence 
utmost   caution   is   required   to   be   exercised   in   dealing   with 
situations   where   there   are   multiple   testimonies   and   equally 
large numbers of witnesses testimonies before the court. These 
must   be   a   common   string   that   should   run   through   out   the 
evidence of all the witnesses and thereby satisfying the test of 
consistency in evidence amongst all the witnesses.

evidence of an injured witness has a greater evidentiary value 
and unless compelling reasons exist, their statements are not to 
be discarded lightly.  The evidence of injured witness cannot be 
doubted on some embellishment in natural conduct or minor 
contradictions. If there be any contradiction, exaggeration and 
immaterial   embellishments   in   the   evidence   of   an   injured 
witness,   then   such   contradiction,   exaggeration   or 
embellishment   should   be   discarded   from   the   evidence   of 
injured, but not the whole evidence.

<p id="p_41">39.           So   far   as   contradictions   and   discrepancies, 
embellishments   and   improvements   are   concerned,   in   every 
criminal case the same are bound to occur for the reason that 
witnesses, owing to common errors in observation, i.e. Errors of 
memory   due   to   lapse   of   time,   or   errors   owing   to   mental 
disposition, such as feelings shock or horror that existed at the 
time occurrence.   The court must form its opinion about the 
credibility   of   a   witness,   and   record   a   finding   with   respect   to 
whether his deposition inspires confidence.  Exaggeration per se 
does not render the evidence brittle.   But it can be one of the 
factors against which the credibility of the prosecution's story 
can be tested, when the entire evidence is put in a crucible to 
test the same on the touchstone of credibility.  Therefore, mere 
marginal   variations   in   the   statements   of   a   witness   cannot   be 
dubbed as improvements, as the same may be elaborations of a 
statement made by the witness at an earlier stage.   Irrelevant 
details   which   do   not   in   any   way   corrode   the   credibility   of   a 
witness cannot be labelled as omissions or contradictions. The 
omissions   which   amount   to   contradictions   in   material 
particulars, i.e. Which materially affect the trial, or the core of

the case of the prosecution, render the testimony of the witness 
as liable to be discredited. Where such omission(s) amount to 
contradiction(s), raising serious doubts about the truthfulness 
of   a   witness,   and   other   witnesses   also   make   material 
improvements before the court in order to make their evidence 
acceptable, it cannot be said that it is safe to  rely upon  such 
evidence.

<p id="p_42">40.           Now the question arises whether the act of accused 
Mukesh tantamount to attempt to murder or not.   <a href="/doc/1158685/" id="a_16">Section 307</a> 
applies   to   attempt   to   murder,   in   which   there   has   been   not 
merely a commencement of an execution of the purpose, but 
something   little   short   of   a   complete   execution,   the 
consummation being hindered by circumstances independent 
of the will of the author. The act or omission, although it does 
not cause death, is carried to such a length as, at the time of 
carrying   it   to   that   length,   the   offender   considers   sufficient   to 
cause death. It is sufficient if the act was one capable of causing 
death   and   there   was   an   intention   to   cause   death.   A   person 
commits an offence under <a href="/doc/1158685/" id="a_17">Section 307</a> when he has an intention 
to commit murder and in pursuance of that intention does an 
act towards its commission irrespective of the fact whether that 
act is the penultimate act or not.

                                                                    State Vs.Mukesh


</p><p id="p_44">41.           To convict under this section it is not necessary to 
show that bodily injury capable of causing death was inflicted. 
What the court has to see is whether the act, irrespective of its 
result,   was   done   with   the   intention   of   knowledge   and   under 
circumstances mentioned in the section. Attempt need not be 
penultimate act. It is sufficient if there is intent coupled with 
some overt act in execution thereof an attempt is an intentional 
preparatory   action   which   fails   in   its   object,   which   so   fails 
through circumstances independent of the person who seeks its 
accomplishment.     Specific   intention   to   commit   the   crime   of 
murder is  a necessary  pre­requisite of the section. To bring  a 
case within the ambit of   <a href="/doc/1158685/" id="a_18">Section 307</a>, the prosecution has to 
make   out   facts   and   circumstances   envisaged   by     <a href="/doc/626019/" id="a_19">Section   300</a> 
IPC. If the ingredients of   <a href="/doc/1158685/" id="a_20">Section 300</a> are wholly lacking, there 
can be no conviction under   <a href="/doc/1158685/" id="a_21">Section 307</a>. Unless it can be said 
that   the   intention   or   knowledge   of   the   accused   was   to   cause 
such bodily injury as would come within one of the four clauses 
of  <a href="/doc/626019/" id="a_22">Section 300</a> IPC and I am of the opinion that act of accused 
persons who shared common intention with his co­accued in 
inflicting injuries on the body of PW­2 is falling within the four 
corners   of   definition   of  attempt   to   murder   under  <a href="/doc/455468/" id="a_23">section   307</a> 
IPC.
