             ---------------------------------------
                W.P.(C). Nos. 18123 of 2012
                       &amp; 10552 of 2012
             ----------------------------------------
          Dated this the 8th day of August, 2012

                           JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">      The grievance appears to be common in respect of both

these writ petitions in so far as the assessment has already been

completed ignoring the 'F' forms submitted by the petitioner. The

pleadings and proceedings reveal that the petitioner had

approached this Court with the same grievance in respect of the

assessment    for  the   year    2006-07   by  filing  W.P.(C)No.

8285/2012, when it was observed with reference to the above

specific grievance, that it was not a matter to be considered by

this Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India. It was

accordingly, that the said writ petition was dismissed as per

Ext.P7 judgment dated 2.4.2012, relegating the petitioner to

avail statutory remedy.
</p>
<p id="p_2">      2.   The case of the petitioner as projected in W.P.(C)

No.10552/2012 is that, pursuant to the above verdict in W.P.(C).

No.8285/2012, the petitioner preferred an application for

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">W.P.C. Nos. 18123&amp;10552 of 2012 -2-</span>


rectification of error apparent on the face of record and despite

the pendency of above proceedings, the petitioner was

confronted with demand notice under the RR Act, which made

them to approach this Court, challenging the same.          In the

meanwhile, the application for rectification came to be dismissed

as per order dated 21.5.2012 vide Ext.P10 produced in W.P.(C)

No.18123/2012, which in turn is under challenge in the said writ

petition.
</p>
<p id="p_3">      3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner as well as

the learned Government Pleader at length.
</p>
<p id="p_4">      4. The case of the petitioner is that, the stand taken by the

concerned respondent rejecting the application for rectification,

observing that there is no error apparent on the face of the

record, to have invoke the power of rectification as provided in

the statute, is not correct or sustainable. The assessment ought

to have been finalized only with reference to the originals of 'F'

forms stated as preferred by the petitioner before the third

respondent. It was in the course of the proceedings that the

entire records came to be transferred to the second respondent

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">W.P.C. Nos. 18123&amp;10552 of 2012  -3-</span>


and assessment has been finalized without referring to the

originals. According to the Department, they are not having the

originals, which however is sought to be rebutted by the

petitioner by referring to the entries in the 'local delivery book',

copy of which has been produced as Ext.P3 and P4.

</p><p id="p_5">      5. After hearing both the sides, this Court finds, whether

the originals of the 'F' forms were actually submitted by the

petitioner and what is the consequence, especially with regard to

the claim put forth by the petitioner are matters which require to

be considered and adjudicated by way of proper fact adjudication

exercise.   This in turn has to be pursued by the concerned

authority under the relevant provisions of the statute; which

exercise cannot be pursued by this Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_2">Article 226</a> of the

Constitution of India. Obviously, it is for the same reason that

interference was declined in the earlier round of litigation by this

Court, passing Ext.P7 judgment.
</p>
<p id="p_6">      6. In the said circumstances, it is open for the petitioner to

pursue the matter by way of appeal before the appropriate

authority, if so advised. Accordingly, interference is declined and

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">W.P.C. Nos. 18123&amp;10552 of 2012 -4-</span>


these writ petitions are dismissed. However, so as to enable the

petitioner to pursue the matter as above, all further proceedings

pursuant to Ext.P10 in W.P.(C) No.10552/2012 shall be kept in

abeyance for a period of one month.
