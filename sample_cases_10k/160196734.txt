                 CORAM: HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE ANIL KUMAR UPADHYAY
                                       ORAL ORDER</pre>

<p id="p_1">8   18-06-2018                 Heard Mr. Brisketu Sharan Pandey, learned counsel

                  for the petitioner and learned counsel for the State.

</p><p id="p_2">                              The petitioner is aggrieved by the order contained in

                  Annexure-2 and the appellate order as contained in Annexure-1.

</p><p id="p_3">                              Learned counsel for the petitioner refers to Annexure-

                  4 to submit that the memo of charge is in fact not a charge of

                  misconduct but it refers to a finding and as such the entire

                  proceeding is vitiated on account of error in framing of the

                  charge i.e. instead of framing charge finding has been

                  mentioned in the memo of charge. His second submission is that

                  the petitioner has adduced evidence in support of his case on
 Patna High Court CWJC No.9920 of 2011(8) dt.18-06-2018
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                            2/4</span>




         forfeiture of salary for the period of suspension but no show

         cause was issued and as such the order of forfeiture of salary for

         the period of suspension is unsustainable. He submits that in

         fact, in the instant case only empty formality has been

         completed as the departmental proceeding has not been

         conducted properly in accordance with law against the

         petitioner. The petitioner has been punished in this case only on

         the basis of finding in judicial proceeding.

</p><p id="p_4">                      Learned counsel for the respondents submits that the

         petitioner has been inflicted punishment on the basis of proved

         charges in judicial proceeding.
</p>
<p id="p_5">                      On consideration of the rival contention of the parties

         and on perusal of the documents available on the record, it

         appears that the respondents have not issued any show cause

         which is required for forfeiture of the salary for the period of

         suspension. They have not taken separate decision as to how

         they have treated the period of suspension of the petitioner after

         opportunity of hearing.
</p>
<p id="p_6">                      So far as the forfeiture of 5% pension is concerned,

         learned counsel submits that it is highly disproportionate and the

         petitioner has to suffer pecuniary loss every month.

</p><p id="p_7">                      Considering the submission advanced on behalf of the
 Patna High Court CWJC No.9920 of 2011(8) dt.18-06-2018
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                            3/4</span>




         petitioner, the Court is of the considered view that the

         respondents have not issued any show cause on the point of

         forfeiture of salary for the period of suspension, which is

         essential requirement in a departmental proceeding as no

         separate action was initiated and no separate decision was taken

         and only one composite order was passed on the show cause

         which was issued for the purpose of forfeiture of 5% pension.

         Such order, in the opinion of the Court, is unsustainable.

</p><p id="p_8">                      The court is of the view that the respondents are

         required to issue show cause on the point of treatment of the

         period of suspension whether the salary should be paid for the

         aforesaid period or not and only after opportunity of hearing, the

         respondents may pass order on forfeature of salary for the

         period of suspension.
</p>
<p id="p_9">                      Adverting to the issue that the charges were not the

         charges rather instead of framing charge of misconduct, the

         Annexure-4 has been issued incorporating finding on the

         charges and as such the departmental proceeding is only an

         empty formality and misconduct was not proved rather it was

         based on the findings at the initial stage, the court in the absence

         of challenge as to the finding of judicial proceedings, is unable

         to enter into the controversy whether the petitioner was
             Patna High Court CWJC No.9920 of 2011(8) dt.18-06-2018
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                                        4/4</span>




                     proceeded against in accordance with law or not and whether

                     the charges contained in Annexure-4 is vitiated on account of

                     reference of finding in a judicial proceeding. However,

                     considering the fact that the petitioner has superannuated and he

                     has to suffer loss of 5% pension every month, the respondents

                     are hereby directed to reconsider the quantum of punishment

                     considering the hardship discussed hereinabove and take final

                     decision in the light of the principles laid down by the Apex

                     Court in the case of <a href="/doc/1508554/" id="a_1">B.C. Chaturvedi vs Union Of India And

                     Ors</a>.: AIR 1996 SC 484 = (1995) 6 SCC 749 within a period

                     of three months from the date of receipt/production of a copy of

                     this order.
</p>
<p id="p_10">                                   The respondents are required to give opportunity of

                     hearing to the petitioner on the point of forfeiture of salary for

                     the period of suspension and pass order afresh after hearing the

                     petitioner within the time frame indicated hereinabove.
