         Dated this the 07th day of August, 2012

                          JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">     The complainant in a prosecution for the offence

punishable   under      <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_1">Section      138</a>     of    the Negotiable

Instruments Act, 1881 (for short 'the N.I.Act') is the

appellant as it is aggrieved by the order dated 31/10/2008

in S.T.No.1861 of 2006 of the court of the Judicial

Magistrate of the First Class-I, Kottayam by which the

learned Magistrate acquitted the accused under <a href="/doc/1454285/" id="a_2">Section

255(1)</a> of the Cr.P.C.
</p>
<p id="p_2">     2.   The case of the complainant is that the accused

is a distributor of packeted tea, a product of the

complainant company, from its plantation and an amount

of Rs.56,341/- was due to the company from the accused

connected with the above transaction and towards the

discharge of the said liability the accused issued Ext.P2

cheque dated 03/01/2006 for Rs.56,341/- which when

Crl.A.No.360./2009

presented        for encashment   dishonoured     due    to

"insufficiency of fund" in the account maintained by the

accused and though a notice was served on the accused

demanding the dishonoured cheque amount, no payment

was made and therefore the accused has committed

offences punishable under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_3">Section 138</a> of the N.I. Act.

During the trial of the case PW.1 was examined at the

side of the complainant and Exts.P1 to P10 were marked.

Though no witness was examined, D1 was marked from

the side of the defence. The trial court finally found that

the complainant could not prove the case against the

accused beyond reasonable doubt and accordingly found

that the accused is not guilty and thus he is acquitted

under <a href="/doc/1454285/" id="a_4">Section 255(1)</a> of Cr.P.C.    It is the above finding

and order of acquittal challenged in this appeal.

</p><p id="p_3">      3.     Heard Adv.Sri.Joseph Kodianthara, learned

counsel for the appellant and Sri.George Sebastian,

learned counsel for the first respondent.      I have also

perused the judgment of the trial court.

Crl.A.No.360./2009
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                              : 3 :</span>


</p><p id="p_4">      4.     The   learned   counsel    for the   appellant

vehemently submitted that the trial court is wrong in its

finding and accepting the case of the defence that cheque

was given as a security.        It is the submission of the

learned counsel for the appellant that the accused

volunteered to contact the office of the complainant by

bringing a filled up cheque and signed on it before PW.1

and handed over the same towards the discharge of the

liability. But the learned Magistrate, though there is no

evidence to show that Ext.P2 cheque was given as a

security, proceeded to accept the case of defence and

erroneously held the complainant could not prove the

case against the accused beyond reasonable doubt. On

the other hand the counsel for the respondent submitted

that the complainant has miserably failed to prove the

due execution of Ext.P2 cheque and therefore the learned

Magistrate is correct in its finding and therefore no

interference is warranted.
</p>
<p id="p_5">      5.     I have carefully considered the submission of

the learned counsel for the appellant and the learned

Crl.A.No.360./2009
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                : 4 :</span>


counsel for the respondent and I have perused the

judgment of the trial court.
</p>
<p id="p_6">      6.     In the light of the rival contentions advanced by

the counsel for the appellant as well as the counsel for

the respondent and in the light of the findings of the

court below on the basis of the evidence and materials

referred to in the impugned judgment, the question to be

considered is whether the appellant has succeeded in

making out a prima facie case in support of its challenge

against the judgment impugned in this appeal and

whether the appellant has succeeded in making out any

exceptional or substantial reason so as to interfere with

the order of acquittal recorded in favour of the accused.

It is beyond dispute that the accused was a distributor of

the complainant company and they had frequent

transactions. As per the evidence of PW.1 the last

transaction was on 31/05/2005.              According to the

complainant an amount of Rs.56,341/- was due from the

accused to the complainant and therefore towards the

discharge of the liability the accused issued Ext.P2

Crl.A.No.360./2009
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                             : 5 :</span>


cheque. But the case of the defence is that Ext.P2 cheque

is the one which handed over to the complainant as

security in blank form, when he was appointed as the

distributor for the complainant company. According to

him he never executed and issued the cheque to the

complainant as claimed by it. The learned Magistrate

after going through the evidence of materials on record

has found that it is unbelievable that the accused brought

a filled up cheque and the complainant has received the

same since no ordinary person is expected to receive a

cheque which not filled up before him unless there are

some      circumstances   warrant   such   a   transaction.

According to me, the above approach or finding of the

learned Magistrate cannot be treated as perverse.

</p><p id="p_7">      7.     In the present case it can be seen that even

according to the complainant the last transaction as per

Bill No.243 was on 31/05/2005. Ext.P2 cheque is dated

03/01/2006. There is a long gap of six months between

the date of last transaction and date of Ext.P2 cheque.

There is no material or evidence to show that after the

Crl.A.No.360./2009
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                               : 6 :</span>


last    transaction    the   complainant     approached   or

demanded the accused to clear the liability of Rs.56,341/-.

If that be so it is quite unbelievable that the accused

approached the complainant on the fine morning of

03/01/2006 and brought a filled up cheque showing the

amount as Rs.56,341/-. In this juncture, it is also relevant

to note the complainant has no case that the accused is

an illiterate man to bring a filled up cheque. It is to be

noted that the learned Magistrate has found that PW.1

during the cross-examination has stated that the cheque

had been given after the accused got convinced about the

outstanding balance from the office of the complainant.

The above claim of PW.1 worsened the case of the

complainant. As I stated earlier no material or evidence

to show that the accused was demanded to discharge the

liability, if any, and there is also no evidence to show that

the accused contacted the office and verified the records

so as to ascertain the outstanding balance amount. It is

also relevant to note that if the accused has ascertained

the amount from the office of the complainant, there is no

Crl.A.No.360./2009
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                : 7 :</span>


question of bringing a filled up cheque and signing it in

front of PW.1 or any other officials of complainant

company. With respect to these aspects there is no

convincing explanation supported by any evidence.

Therefore it appears that the learned Magistrate refused

to accept the case of the complainant on the basis of the

available evidence and materials and assigning proper

reasons.
</p>
<p id="p_8">       In a recent decision of the Apex Court reported in

<a href="/doc/34062092/" id="a_5">State of Rajasthan v. Darshan Singh @ Darshan Lal</a>

(2012(4) Supreme 72), the Hon'ble Apex Court has held

that the jurisdiction of the appellate court to interfere

with the order of acquittal is very limited.           The Apex

Court has held as follows:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">                 "In exceptional cases where there are

          compelling circumstances and the judgment

          under appeal is found to be perverse, the

          appellate court can interfere with the order of

          acquittal. The appellate court should bear in

          mind the presumption of innocence of the

          accused and further that the trial court's

          acquittal bolsters the presumption of his

          innocence."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_9">Crl.A.No.360./2009
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                              : 8 :</span>


Thus, on examination of the facts and circumstances

involved in the present case, in the light of the dictum

laid down by the Apex Court in the decision cited supra,

I find no ground to interfere with the order of acquittal

recorded by the trial court. From the foregone

discussions it can be seen that the impugned judgment

cannot be treated as a perverse one. Therefore according

to me the complainant has miserably failed to make out a

prima facie case in support of its challenge against the

judgment impugned.        Hence there is no merit in this

appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_10">      In the result, this appeal is dismissed.
