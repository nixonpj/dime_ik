</pre><p id="p_1">01.     This appeal has been preferred against the judgment and award
        dated 23.10.2017, passed by the learned J&amp;K State Consumer
        Disputes Redressal Commission, Jammu.
</p>
<p id="p_2">02.     Briefly stated, the material facts are as under:-
</p>
<p id="p_3">03.     The respondents are the owners of two houses, which were
        insured with the appellant-Insurance Company. The houses
        appear to have been gutted in a fire incident for which the
        respondents/complainants made a claim with the Insurance
        Company. The surveyor deputed by the Company assessed the
        loss as following:-

<p id="p_4">                -   For three storey building       :    Rs. 1,13,826.00

</p><p id="p_5">               -   For two storey building         :    Rs. 1,06,459.00


</p><p id="p_6">04.   The Insurance Company, however, after receipt of the Surveyor's
      report did not make the requisite payment, which forced the
      complainants to prefer a complaint before the J&amp;K State
      Consumer     Disputes      Redressal     Commission,   Jammu.       The
      Commission by virtue of judgment and award dated 23.10.2017
      allowed the complaint. In its order, the Commission noticed that a
      total amount of Rs.2,20,285.00, determined by the Surveyor, had
      incorrectly been assessed, inasmuch as, while arriving at the said
      figure the Surveyor had allowed 50% depreciation in regard to the
      property in question.
</p>
<p id="p_7">05.   The Commission came to a conclusion that since the property in
      question was less than thirty years old, the rate of depreciation
      ought not to have been more than 20%. While placing reliance
      upon an earlier decision of the Commission, in which reference
      was made to the Insurance Manual, it arrived at the conclusion
      that the rate of depreciation could not have exceeded 1% per year,
      in case the property was less than thirty years old. The
      Commission, therefore, enhanced the compensation from
      Rs.2,20,285.00 to Rs.4,20,000.00 on account of loss to the
      property. Besides this, the Commission also allowed litigation
      expenses of Rs.10,000.00 along with interest @ 10 % per annum
      on the awarded amount from the date of filing of the complaint.

<p id="p_8"> 06.    We have heard learned counsel for the appellants.
</p>
<p id="p_9">07.    It is not denied that the property in question was insured with the
       appellants - Insurance Company and the same was gutted in a fire
       incident. It is also admitted that a Surevyor was appointed by the
       Insurance Company, who assessed the loss to the tune of Rs.
       2,20,285.00, after allowing 50% depreciation in regard to the
       property in question. Learned counsel for the appellants was
       unable to justify as to how the rate of 20% depreciation was
       inappropriate or contrary to the Insurance Manual.
</p>
<p id="p_10">08.    Having heard learned counsel for the appellants, we cannot
       persuade ourselves to take a different view from the one taken by
       the J&amp;K State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission,
       Jammu. Be that as it may, the appeal is found to be without any
       merit and is, accordingly, dismissed along with connected IAs.
</p>
<p id="p_11">09.    Registry to release the awarded amount along with interest in
       favour of the claimants.
</p>
<p id="p_12">10.    Records be sent back forthwith.</p><pre id="pre_3">
