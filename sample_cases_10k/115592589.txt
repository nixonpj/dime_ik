<p id="p_1">            Petitioner has filed this petition under <a href="/doc/834094/" id="a_1">Section 407</a> read with

<a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_2">Section 482</a> Cr.P.C. against respondent Avinash Chander for transfer of

criminal complaint bearing No.Nact./314/2017 instituted on 03.05.2017

filed by respondent under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_3">Section 138</a> of the Negotiable Instruments Act

against the petitioner titled as 'Avinash Chander Kamra vs. Gurinder Kaur'

pending in the Court of Chief Judicial Magistrate, Sangrur, to the court of

competent   jurisdiction    at    Patiala,   where   other   similar     complaint

No.1753/2015 filed by the wife of the respondent against the petitioner

titled as 'Darshna Devi vs. Gurinder Kaur' and criminal complaint

No.1132/2017 filed by the respondent against the petitioner titled as

'Avinash Chander Kamra vs. Gurinder Kaur' under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_4">Section 138</a> of the

Negotiable Instruments Act, are pending.

             Notice of motion was issued.           Learned counsel for the

respondent appeared and contested the petition.
</p>
<p id="p_3">             I have heard learned counsel for the parties and have gone

through the record.
</p>
<p id="p_4">             Learned counsel for the petitioner argued that qua same

transaction between the parties and to pay same liability, two cheques have

been issued by the accused. Qua one cheque, the complaint was filed at

Patiala whereas regarding second cheque, it was presented at Sangrur and

the complaint was filed at Sangrur.
</p>
<p id="p_5">             Learned counsel for the respondent argued that respondent is ill

and cannot go to Patiala.       This argument of learned counsel for the

respondent has no merit. As one of the complaint is pending at Patiala,

therefore, respondent is to pursue that complaint at Patiala. If this complaint

is also transferred to Patiala Sessions Division, there will be no difficulty.

Otherwise also, parties are same and the transaction is also same and for

discharging same liability, two cheques have been issued. Therefore, it is

also necessary in the interest of justice that both the cases should be tried by

one and the same Court to avoid conflicting judgments. Moreover, the

Hon'ble Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/1594211/" id="a_5">Damodar S. Prabhu vs. Sayed Babalal H</a>., 2010

(2) RCR (Criminal) 851, has held as under:-

<p id="p_6">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">             "16. We are also in agreement with the Learned Attorney
             General's suggestions for controlling the filing of multiple
             complaints that are relatable to the same transaction. It was
             submitted that complaints are being increasingly filed in
             multiple jurisdictions in a vexatious manner which causes
             tremendous harassment and prejudice to the drawers of the
             cheque. For instance, in the same transaction pertaining to a
             loan taken on an installment basis to be repaid in equated
             monthly installments, several cheques are taken which are
             dated for each monthly installment and upon the dishonor of
                               2 of 3

            each of such cheques, different complaints are being filed in
            different courts which may also have jurisdiction in relation to
            the complaint. In light of this submission, we direct that it
            should be mandatory for the complainant to disclose that no
            other complaint has been filed in any other court in respect of
            the same transaction. Such a disclosure should be made on a
            sworn affidavit which should accompany the complaint filed
            under <a href="/doc/444619/" id="a_6">Section 200</a> of the Criminal Procedure Code. If it is
            found that such multiple complaints have been filed, orders for
            transfer of the complaint to the first court should be given,
            generally speaking, by the High Court after imposing heavy
            costs on the complainant for resorting to such a practice.
            These directions should be given effect prospectively."</blockquote><p id="p_7">


</p><p id="p_8">            Keeping in view the law laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme

Court and also for convenience of both the parties, the criminal complaint

bearing No.Nact./314/2017 instituted on 03.05.2017 under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_7">Section 138</a> of

the Negotiable Instruments Act titled as 'Avinash Chander Kamra vs.

Gurinder Kaur' which is pending before learned CJM, Sangrur is transferred

to Sessions Division, Patiala. Learned CJM, Sangrur is directed to send the

record of above-said complaint to learned Sessions Judge, Patiala, who will

entrust that complaint to the same Court where other complaint between the

same parties is already pending. The parties are directed to appear before

learned Sessions Judge, Patiala, on 04.12.2017.
