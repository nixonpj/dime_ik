</pre>
<p id="p_1">      This petition is filed by the petitioners under <a href="/doc/136948773/" id="a_1">Section 166</a> of M.V.

Act     against    the     respondents         claiming    compensation   of

Rs.30,00,000/­ for the death of the son of petitioner No.1 and 2 and

brother of Petitioner No.3 in the accident that occurred on

15.01.2018.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">      2) The brief facts of the petitioner case as averred in the petition

are as under:
</p>
<p id="p_4">             That on 15.01.2018 at about 7.00 pm., the deceased was

proceeding on a motor bike bearing No.KA­51­EM­1851 as a pillion
 SCCH - 11                         3                    MVC 584/2018

rider. At that time his friend namely Mahesha was riding the above

said motor bike, on Hosur - Bangalore NH­7 road beside Kirthana

hotel, Opposite to Apartment road, Chandapura, while returning

back to deceased home. From the starting point of the journey the

rider ridden the said bike at a very high speed in a rash and

negligent manner so as to endangering to human life.         Inspite of

repeated request made by the deceased to go slow. But the rider did

not listen to him. Due to over speed the rider lost control of the said

motor bike and hit against one pedestrian namely Shriranga who

was crossing a road and sustained injuries. Resulting in which the

deceased and rider are fell down along with motor bike and

sustained injuries.   The deceased sustained severe head injury,

injuries over face and other injuries all over the body. Immediately

after the accident deceased was shifted to Sparsh Hospital by the

ambulance, when he was treated and necessary examination was

done. But inspite of best efforts made by the doctor, the deceased

was died on the same day at about 8.55 pm., during the course of

treatment.   Thereafter the body was sent to attibele government

Hospital to conduct the post mortem, after post mortem the body
 SCCH - 11                           4                          MVC 584/2018

was handed over to the Petitioners family members.                    They have

performed    his   funeral   and   last   rites    and    incurred      sum    of

Rs.80,000/­ and also incurred another sum of Rs.60,000/­ for his

treatment, transportation of dead body and other expenses. Prior to

accident the deceased was hale and healthy and he was working at

Ostrich Mobility Instruments Pvt Ltd., as a technician and earning

sum of Rs.15,000/­ per month and he was contributing same for the

family maintenance. Due to this accidental injuries the deceased

died and left behind his legal heirs as his parents and brother. Due

to sudden and tragic death of deceased and Petitioners are lost

beloved son and brother respectively and earning member of the

family hence the Petitioners are put to great hardship and mental

agony. It is very difficult to come out from this shock through their

life. At the time of his death he was aged about 36 years. It is true

that the deceased got married with one Saritha in the year 2009 after

marriage    of   1½   year   the   deceased       and    his   wife    got    mis

understanding and they do not have children and the deceased wife

filed a case in the court of Anekal to take divorce from the deceased,

as per the court order they became separate and deceased wife is no
 SCCH - 11                          5                   MVC 584/2018

where concern to deceased and deceased was not having any

relationship with his wife after the court order. Hence, they have not

made a party in this case, only deceased parents and brother are

legal heirs of deceased. The Suryanagar police have registered a case

against the rider of motor bike bearing No.KA­51­EM­1851, offences

under <a href="/doc/1270101/" id="a_2">section 279</a>, <a href="/doc/1402213/" id="a_3">337</a>, <a href="/doc/409589/" id="a_4">304(A)</a> of IPC. The first respondent being the

insurer and second respondent being the RC owner are jointly and

severally liable to pay the compensation to the petitioners. Therefore,

they prayed for allowing the petition.
</p>
<p id="p_5">

</p><p id="p_6">    3) After service of notice, Respondent No.2 not appeared before

the court hence placed exparte and respondent No.1 have appeared

through their advocate and contested the claim of the petitioners by

filing objection statement wherein, they denied the allegations made

in the petitions as false and frivolous. They have further disputed

the manner of the accident, age of the deceased and quantum of the

compensation claimed under different heads. They have further

contended that, the rider of motorcycle was not holding a valid and

effective driving license at the time of accident. The respondent no.2
 SCCH - 11                           6                   MVC 584/2018

handed over the possession of the vehicle to the said driver and

therefore, has contravened the proviso of <a href="/doc/785258/" id="a_5">MV Act</a>. Further contended

that, it is learnt that the motorcycle in question was ridden by the

deceased at the time of accident and sustained injuries and died due

to his own negligent act of the deceased himself. Hence, they prayed

for dismissal of the petition.
</p>
<p id="p_7">
</p><p id="p_8">      4)     On the basis of the above rival pleadings, the following

issues have been framed:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">                   1. Whether petitioners prove that the son of
           1st and 2nd petitioner brother of 3rd petitioner
           namely Srinivasa G. succumbed to the injuries
           sustained in the accident that took place on
           15.01.2018 at about 7.00 pm Opp Kirthana
           Apartments, NH­7 Road, Chandapura, Attibele
           Hobli, Anekal Taluk, when he was proceeding in a
           motor cycle bearing registration No.KA­51­EM­1851

           riding of the above said motorcycle by its rider?

</p><p id="p_10">       5) To prove the petitioners case, petitioner No.3 filed affidavit

in lieu of examination in chief and examined as PW.1. Besides his
 SCCH - 11                           7                     MVC 584/2018

<pre id="pre_2">       Issue No.1       In the Affirmative;
       Issue No.2       Partly Affirmative;
       Issue No.3       As per final order, for the following :


                              ­:REASONS:­


       8)    ISSUE No.1: As this claim petition has been filed by the

</pre><blockquote id="blockquote_5">petitioners under <a href="/doc/136948773/" id="a_6">Section 166</a> of the M.V.Act, 1989, the burden is on

them to prove that the deceased Srinivasa.G died because of the
 SCCH - 11                         8                    MVC 584/2018

accident which place, as a result of rash and negligent riding by the

rider of the motor bike bearing Reg.No.KA­51­EM­1851.</blockquote><p id="p_15">


</p><p id="p_16">      9) In order to prove the same, petitioner No.3, Muthuraja @

Muthu examined himself as PW.1 filed his chief affidavit in lieu of his

examination in chief reiterating the contents of petition. PW.1 got

marked documents as Ex.P.1 to Ex.P.17 out of which Ex.P.1 is FIR,

Ex.P.2 is complaint lodged by Petitioner No.3 on the basis of which

Suryanagar Police have registered case in crime No.20/2018, police

have drawn spot mahazar as per Ex.P.3, drawn sketch as per Ex.P.4,

IMV report is Ex.P.5, Ex.P.6 is the Inquest, Ex.P.7 is P.M. Report. By

above oral and documentary evidence petitioners proves that there is

an accident in which Srinivasa.G died. Respondent no.1 not denied

the accident, but it is the contention of first respondent that, the

motorcyle in question was ridden by the deceased at the time of

accident ans sustained injuries and died due to own negligence.


</p><p id="p_17">       10)   During cross examination PW.1 deposed that the said

vehicle belongs to one Mahesh. Admitted that he has not seen the

accident. The public who have seen the accident have given
 SCCH - 11                             9                   MVC 584/2018

statement, he and the public who gathered shifted his brother and

rider of motor cycle to sparsha hospital. It is denied suggestion that,

on the date of accident his brother was riding the motor cycle and

accident occurred due to negligence. Further deposed that, ten lakh

compensation    amount    was    paid     by   company.   During   cross

examination nothing is elicited to disbelieve the case of the

petitioner. Ex.P.1 the filing of FIR No.20/2018 and the subsequent

filing of the Ex.P.8 charge sheet corroborated the with evidence of

PW.1. the material on record was sufficient to establish that the rider

of offending vehicle was negligent.
</p>
<p id="p_18">

</p><p id="p_19">     11) To counter the evidence of PW.1, the Respondent no.1 and

2 have not adduced any evidence on its behalf. The respondent no.1

has filed application U/s 170 B of M.V.Act.
</p>
<p id="p_20">

</p><p id="p_21">     12) PW.1 has also been cross - examined in all aspects, but

since he is not an eyewitness to this accident, his evidence is not

helpful regarding proof of negligence is concerned. But the contents

of Police records clearly indicates that, this accident was due to
 SCCH - 11                        10                  MVC 584/2018

negligent riding   by the rider of the offending motor cycle bearing

reg.No.KA­51­EM­1851. Hence Issue No.1 answered in Affirmative.



</p><p id="p_22">     13) ISSUE No.2 ; In order to prove that, petitioners are the

legal representatives of the deceased Srinivasa.G they have produced

Ex.P.9 - ration card, Ex.P.10 Aadhar card of Petitioner No.1, Ex.P.11

Aadhar card of Petitioner No.2, Ex.P.12 Aadhar card of Petitioner

No.3 and Ex.P.13 - Aadhar card of deceased which clearly discloses

the relationship of petitioners with deceased Srinivasa.G and

moreover the respondent also not disputed the relationship hence

relationship between petitioners and deceased not much disputed.


</p><p id="p_23">        14)   Next remains the question regarding quantum of

compensation that has to be awarded. Since this is a case of death,

the age, income of deceased, number of dependents needs to be

considered. As admitted by PW.1 deceased Srinivasa.G was aged 36

years at the time of his death. As per Ex.P.7 - PM report deceased

was aged about 36 years. Hence, without any other go, this court

has to consider the age of the deceased as 36 years, which shows

that at the time of accident deceased was 36 years old. It has come
 SCCH - 11                          11                 MVC 584/2018

in the evidence of PW.1 that, the deceased was working as Ostrich

Mobility Instruments Pvt Ltd., as a technician and earning

Rs.16,459/­ per month. In this regard Petitioners have produced

Ex.P.14 - employment I.D card of deceased, Ex.P.15 - 2 pay slips.

Moreover Petitioners have also examined Accountant, Ostrich

Mobility Instrument Pvt. Ltd., Bengaluru as PW.2. During cross

examination by the Learned Counsel for respondent No.2 PW.2

admitted that, their company having accidental insurance policy in

Star health insurance and they have paid compensation of

Rs.10,50,000/­ to the deceased's family.      Further admitted that,

premium amount for the policy was paid by the company and was

not deducted in the salary of employee. It shows that, the petitioners

have received Rs.10,50,000/­ from Ostrich Mobility Instrument Pvt,

Ltd.,

</p><p id="p_24">        15)   However, considering the nature of avocation and age of

the deceased, I constrain to assess the income of the deceased at

Rs.16,459/­ per month. Hence, considering the date of accident, to

assess the loss of dependency this court is taken income of the

deceased at Rs.16,459/­ per month.
</p><pre id="pre_3"> SCCH - 11                         12                   MVC 584/2018

    16)      As per Post Mortem Report at Ex.P.7 the age of the

</pre><p id="p_25">deceased was 36 years. Hence, the age of deceased is considered as

36 years to assess loss of dependency, the proper multiplier would

be 15 as per Sarla Verma Case. Petitioner No.1 and 2 have lost their

son at their old age, Petitioner No.3 has lost their brother. Under the

circumstances as per the Decision reported in Supreme court of

India in Special Leave Petition (Civil) No.25590 of 2014, (National

Insurance Company Limited V/s Pranay Sethi and Others), it is just

and reasonable to award Rs.15,000/­ each under the heads of loss

of estate and funeral expenses respectively.
</p>
<p id="p_26">
</p><p id="p_27">       17)      Income of the deceased is already considered as

Rs.16,459/­ per month. If 40% is added towards future prospectus

to the income of the deceased it would comes at Rs.23,043/­

(Rs.16,459/­ + Rs.6,584/­). Petitioner No.3 is major hence, Petitioner

No.3 is not considered as dependant, only the Petitioner No.1 and 2

being the parents of deceased Srinivasa.G is considered as the

dependants. Hence, if 1/3rd is deducted out of Rs.23,043/­ then it

would comes to Rs.15,362/­ per month (Rs.23,043/­ - Rs.7,681/­).
</p><p id="p_28"> SCCH - 11                          13                  MVC 584/2018

Since the deceased was aged about 36 years, the proper multiplier

would be 15 as per the ruling reported in: 2009 ACJ 1298 Sarala

Varma Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation. So, the loss of dependency

would be Rs.15,362 x 12 X 15 = Rs.27,65,160/­.</p><pre id="pre_4">
