                          ********
       This MFA is filed U/s. 173(1) of <a href="/doc/785258/" id="a_1">MV Act</a> against the
Judgment and Award dated:02/05/2012 passed in MVC
No.76/2010 on the file of Senior Civil Judge and Motor
Accident Claims Tribunal, Nanjangud, partly allowing the
claim petition for compensation and seeking enhancement of
compensation.
       This M.F.A. coming on for Orders this day, the Court,
delivered the following:
                       :J U D G M E N T:
</pre>
<p id="p_1">      This appeal by the appellant is directed against the

impugned common judgment and award dated 02/05/2012

passed in MVC No.76/2010, by Senior Civil Judge and Motor

Accident Claims Tribunal, Nanjangud, ( for short ' Tribunal'),

for enhancement of compensation.
</p>
<p id="p_2">      2. Along with the appeal, appellant has also filed

I.A.1/2013, seeking condonation of delay of      170 days in

filing the appeal.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                             3</span><p id="p_3">




</p><p id="p_4">      3. Heard learned counsel appearing for appellant.

</p><p id="p_5">      4. The said delay of 170 days in filing the appeal

has been explained in paragraphs 3 and 4 of the

affidavit   dated    23.08.2013     accompanying         the

application, which reads thus:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">            " 3. I submit that I have not preferred
      the above appeal against the order made in
      MVC No.76/2010 on the file of the Senior Civil
      Judge &amp; MACT at Nanjanagud within the
      stipulated time. I submit that I could not
      prefer the above appeal within the stipulated
      time, due to my old age and ill-health, I
      unable to approach my counsel, after few days
      I approached my counsel appearing before
      Tribunal and he suggested me to prefer an
      appeal before this Hon'ble Court for
      enhancement of compensation. After making
      necessary       financial    arrangements     I
      immediately approached the Advocate at
      Bangalore, therefore there is a delay in filing
      the delay in filing the appeal.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">            4. That the delay in filing the above
      appeal for enhancement of the compensation
      is neither intentional nor deliberate and it is
      beyond my control.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">            5. That if the application is not allowed,
      I would be put to great hardship. On the other
      hand no hardship would be caused to
      respondents, if the application is allowed."</blockquote><p id="p_6">
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                 4</span>




</p><p id="p_7">        5. After hearing the learned counsel appearing for

the appellant and after perusing the statements made in

the affidavit filed in support of the application, it

emerges that, there is a delay of 170 days in filing the

appeal.    The   said   delay   has   not   been   explained

satisfactorily by the appellant by assigning cogent and

valid    reasons.   The explanation offered is in a very

casual manner. Even the appellant has failed to         give

dates and     events as to on what date he has applied for

the certified copy of the judgment, on what date he has

received the same and on what date, he has instructed

his counsel to file this appeal. Except making bald

statements, no credible or trustworthy reasons are

assigned for explaining the said delay.       As there is a

delay of 170 days in filing the appeal, the appellant is

bound to explain each day's delay in filing the appeal by

assigning cogent and valid reasons. Much credibility

cannot be given to the explanation offered by the

appellant for condoning the said delay. Hence, in view
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                             5</span>




of non explanation of delay in filing the appeal, in a

satisfactory manner, I am of the view that delay cannot

be condoned nor the appellant has made out a good

case to condone the delay.       Hence, for the foregoing

reasons, I.A.1/2013 is      liable to be dismissed as

misconceived and accordingly, it is dismissed.

</p><p id="p_8">     6. However, in the interest of justice and equity, I

have perused the impugned common judgment passed

by the Tribunal in M.V.C.No.76/2010. The Tribunal,

after due     consideration of   oral and documentary

evidence available on file, taking into consideration the

nature of injuries sustained by the appellant, the nature

and duration of the treatment taken by him, taking into

consideration the answers given by the appellant in his

cross examination, after seeing the conduct and health

condition and that the certificate produced is contrary

to the expression of words by him in his            cross

examination      and assessing the permanent disability

at 10% to the whole body, has justified in awarding    a
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                6</span>




sum of `10,750/- towards injury, pain and sufferings,

`46,800/-     towards loss of amenities, discomforts and

unhappiness,      `3,000/-          towards       conveyance,

nourishing     food     and   attendant    charges,    `2,000/-

towards     loss of income, `2,000/-          towards medical

expenses and in all, `64,550/- with interest at 6% p.a.

from the date of petition till its payment, after assigning

valid reasons. The reason assigned by the Tribunal for

awarding the said compensation on account of the

injuries    sustained    by   the   appellant    is   just    and

reasonable     and    therefore,    it   does   not    call   for

interference. Nor the appellant has made out any good

case to entertain the relief sought in this appeal. Taking all

these factors into consideration, the instant appeal filed by

the appellant is liable to be dismissed on the ground of delay

and laches as also on merits. Ordered accordingly.
