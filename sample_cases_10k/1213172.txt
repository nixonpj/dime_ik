<p id="p_1">CORAM: HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE AUGUSTINE GEORGE MASIH.


Present:-    Ms. Monika Chhibbar, Assistant Advocate General, Punjab,
             for the petitioners.

<p id="p_2">             Mr. Harsh Kinra, Advocate,
             for the respondent No. 1.

AUGUSTINE GEORGE MASIH, J. (ORAL).
</p>
<p id="p_4">
</p><p id="p_5">             In the present writ petition, the challenge is to the award dated

07.01.2008 (Anneuxre-P-1), passed by the Industrial Tribunal, Punjab,

Chandigarh, vide which the reference has been answered in favour of the

workman holding therein that the impugned order of stoppage of four

increments with cumulative effect against the workman is not in accordance

with law, therefore, he is entitled to the benefit from the date of demand

notice with consequential benefits.
</p>
<p id="p_6">             Counsel for the petitioner-management contends that the inquiry

file has been produced by M.W.1 Shri Paramjit Singh Kajla, Dealing
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1"> C.W.P.No. 17690 of 2008.                                                 -2-</span>



Assistant, and has also filed an affidavit in support of his contention on the

basis of the records. The Labour Court has proceeded not to take into

consideration the inquiry file tendered in evidence on the ground that no

evidence has been produced to prove the inquiry proceedings before the

Labour Court, and therefore, the same was not admissible in evidence. She

contends that the document as such could not have been rejected merely on

the ground that no evidence was produced to prove the inquiry proceedings.

She contends that the inquiry held against the respondent-workman is not

disputed by him, what is disputed by him is that he was not given proper

opportunity of hearing violating the principles of natural justice.       She

contends that without going into this aspect of the matter, the Labour Court

has proceed to discard the inquiry and the evidence led by the management.

</p><p id="p_7">            On the other hand, counsel for the respondent-workman

contends that the award passed by the Labour Court, is just and equitable as

the document was required to be proved by the petitioner-management

which they had failed to prove.
</p>
<p id="p_8">            I have heard counsel for the parties and have gone through the

impugned award.
</p>
<p id="p_9">            The reasons as given by the Labour Court while overlooking

the evidence with regard to the inquiry file is totally misplaced. The inquiry

as held by the Inquiry Officer, is not in dispute, therefore, the document was

not disputed. What was asserted before the Labour Court was that the

respondent-workman has not been given proper opportunity to defend

himself during the inquiry proceedings, thus, violating the principles of

natural justice, and therefore, the inquiry held against him was not fair and

proper nor in accordance with law. That being the position, findings as

recorded by the Labour Court in para-15 of the award, cannot be sustained

and is hereby set aside. Accordingly, the impugned award dated 07.01.2008

(Annexure-P-1) impugned herein, is set aside. The matter is remanded back

to the Labour Court for fresh adjudication, as per the observations made

above in accordance with law.

<p id="p_10">            The parties are directed to appear before the Industrial Tribunal,

Punjab, Chandigarh, on 30.03.2009.
