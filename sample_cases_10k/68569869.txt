    Court No. 14

    Item No. SL-29

                                        Jatindranath Mondal &amp; Ors.
    (dismissed)


                     Mr. Lakshminath Bhattacharya, Advocate
                                                          ......for the Petitioner

                           This revisional application is directed against an order no.

                     51 dated January 13, 2014 passed by the learned Additional

                     District Judge, Fast Track Court-I, Diamond Harbour in Title

                     Appeal No. 26, of 2005 by which the service of the notice of

                     appeal was directed to be effected upon the substituted

                     respondents.</pre>


<p id="p_1">                           The suit filed by the petitioner against 19 defendants was

                     contested by the appellant in the Trial Court.       The decree

                     passed by the Trial Court is assailed by the said defendant

                     before the appellate Court. During the pendency of the appeal

                     one of the respondents died. An application for substitution

                     taken out within the period of limitation, was allowed and the

                     service of notice was directed to be served upon the

                     respondent.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">                           It is tried to be contended by the petitioner that no notice

                     of appeal should be served upon the substituted defendants, as

                     they did not contest in the Trial Court.
</p>
<p id="p_4">
</p><p id="p_5">                           Order 41 Rule 14 provides for dispensation of the service

                     of notice by the appellate court provided the proviso inserted in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1"> 2</span>



    sub-rule (3) thereof is satisfied. The learned Advocate of the

    petitioner appears to be misconstrued of the provision of Order

    41 of Rule 14 in saying that no substitution should have been

    allowed by the Trial Court.
</p>
<p id="p_6">
</p><p id="p_7">          Since the Court has directed the service to be effected

    upon the substituted respondent, this Court, therefore, does not

    find any infirmity and/or illegality in the order impugned.


</p><p id="p_8">          This revisional application is vexatious and does not

    deserve to stand even for a moment.          The same is hereby

    dismissed. There shall, however, no order as to costs.
