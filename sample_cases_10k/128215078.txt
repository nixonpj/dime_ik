27.04.2016
      Shri Amit Panchal, learned counsel for the applicant.
      Shri   Bhuwan     Deshmukh,      learned        GA   for   the
respondent/State.</pre>
<p id="p_1">      This petition has been filed under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_1">Section 482</a> of the
Cr.P.C.
</p><p id="p_2">      It is stated that husband of the petitioner has died on
24/09/09, who was the owner of land bearing survey
No.829/2, 898 and 901 situated at village Bhikampur, Tehsil -
Khachrod, Distt. - Ujjain. After death of her husband, dispute
took place between her sons namely Mohanalal, Lalaram and
Babulal regarding the share in the land. Applicant has lodged
the report at P.S. Khachrod where Sureshchandra Songara
was   posted    at   Constable.   It   is   further    stated    that
Sureshchandra used to insist for partition and said that he will
get the Paoti from Patwari and Tehsildar. On 28/03/10,
Sureshchandra telephoned the sons of the applicant/Babulal
and asked him to come to Tehsil, he will file the proceedings
for partition, then applicant her daughter and Babulal came to
Khachrod, where Sureshchandra got her signature and
thumb impression on stamp paper submitting that he would
get the proceedings from Patwari and assured that Patwari
would be supplied after 10-15 days. Thereafter, Babulal
contacted Sureshchandra for getting the Paoti, but assurance
has been given. Ultimately when applicant and her sons
contacted at Tehsil Office Khachrod, then proceeding was
done. When Babulal obtained the copy of Khasra, it was
found that survey No.829/2 has been recorded in the name of
Anita @ Gatta Bai, who is the wife of Sureshchandra. When
Sureshchandra was contacted, he has not given satisfactory
 answer. Thus, Sureshchandra has got the name of his wife
mutated in the land of the applicant by forging documents.
Complaint was made, but no action has been taken against
the   said     constable/Sureshchandra.    It   is   prayed   that
respondent be directed to register the FIR in light of the
judgment of Hon'ble the Apex Court rendered in the case of
Lalita Kumari Vs. Govt. of U.P. &amp; Ors. reported in (2014) 2
SCC 1.
</p><p id="p_3">      I have considered the submission of learned counsel for
the applicant and gone through the copy of the complaint as
well as documents.
</p><p id="p_4">      Taking into consideration the allegation made in the
complaint and the documents annexed with the complaint,
this petition is disposed of with a direction to the applicant to
submit a fresh complaint within 15 days to SHO, P.S.
Khachrod and if such a complaint is filed, respondent No.4 is
directed to examine the same and if it discloses the
commission of cognizable offence, then proceedings be
initiated    against   the   said   constable/Sureshchandra     in
accordance with law and in light of the directionss given by
the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Lalita Kumari (supra).
</p><p id="p_5">      Accordingly, the petition (M.Cr.C. No.587/16) stands
disposed of.
</p><p id="p_6">                                            (D.K.Paliwal)
