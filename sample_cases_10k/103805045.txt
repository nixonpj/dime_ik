<p id="p_1">            This petition has been filed under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_1">Section 482</a> Cr.P.C. for

quashing of order dated 06.10.2018 passed by the Court of Additional

Sessions Judge, Ludhiana whereby the application filed under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_2">Section 311</a>

Cr.P.C. for recalling of the prosecution witnesses for proving the MLR has

been declined in a case FIR No.93 dated 14.05.2010 registered under

<a href="/doc/455468/" id="a_3">Sections 307</a>/<a href="/doc/838469/" id="a_4">452</a>/<a href="/doc/763672/" id="a_5">148</a>/<a href="/doc/999134/" id="a_6">149</a>/<a href="/doc/222396/" id="a_7">427</a> IPC at Police Station Division No.6,

injured the victims had been removed to the Christian Medical College,

Ludhiana and their MLRs were also prepared from there. However when

the case had come up for evidence it transpired that the doctors who had

conducted the medical had left the job and had gone abroad. At the time

when the medical was being conducted two doctors namely Dr.A.K.Saran

and Dr.Vijay Obed were shown to be incharge of the unit which had

conducted the medical.      It was in these circumstances, that the instant

application had been moved under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_8">Section 311</a> Cr.P.C. to examine those

doctors so that they may be able to testify about the injuries. He has further

argued that the reason which appears in the impugned order is ex-facie

incorrect because it has been mentioned in the impugned order that there is

no document on the record to show that these persons were present.

However, the MLR clearly shows the presence of these doctors.

</p><p id="p_4">             Counsel for the private respondents has argued that the

evidence of injuries can only be given by the doctors who had actually

conducted the medical.
</p>
<p id="p_5">             In my opinion, this point can well be agitated in the cross-

examination but in the circumstances of the case where the doctors who

conducted the medical can not be summoned since they have resigned and

gone abroad, an opportunity can not be denied to the petitioner-injured to

prove the medical status of the victim. I, however, also cannot lose sight of

the fact that the trial started in the year 2011 and it is now 8 long years.

</p><p id="p_6">             Learned Deputy Advocate General and counsel for the private

respondents have undertaken that they would examine these two witnesses

if two effective opportunities are granted to them.

</p><p id="p_7">             With this specific understanding the present petition is allowed.</p><pre id="pre_2">
