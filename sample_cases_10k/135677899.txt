JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">1              By this judgment, I shall dispose off the appeal preferred by

the   appellant,   who   was   the   petitioner   in   the   trial   court   against   the

respondents.
</p>
<p id="p_2">2              Brief facts, relevant for the disposal of the appeal are ; the

appellant  had filed a suit  before the trial  court on the ground that the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                              2</span>

plaintiff   was   a   press   reporter   and   the   defendant   No.1   contacted   the

plaintiff on introduction of a common friend in the year 2000 and plaintiff

at   no   point   of   time   took   any   temporary   financial   assistance   from

defendant No.1, but the defendnat No.1 in order to extort money from the

plaintiff made efforts by dishonest intentions to procure signatures of the

plaintiff on the blank papers in the month of October, 2002, but he could

not succeed in his evil designs, and in order to do so defendant No.1 also

secured the assistance of police officials, but the plaintiff refused.   It is

further   stated   that   in   the   last   week   of   December,   2004   some   police

officials from P.S Tilak Marg came to the residence of the plaintiff and

tried to take the plaintiff to PS Tilak Nagar, but due to the intervention of

the   residents   of   the   locality   they   could   not   succeed,   and   plaintiff

immediately   lodged   a   complaint   on   31.12.2002   with   the   police,   but   no

action was taken against them.  It is stated that on 2.1.2003 certain police

officials mentioned in Para 7 of the petition took him to the PS and the

plaintiff was forced to pay Rs.2 lacs to the defendant No.1 and despite the

fact   that   the   plaintiff   had   not   availed   any   financial   facility   from   the

defendant No.1, so the question of payment did not arise at all, and the

police   officials   of   the   defendant   No.2   mis­behaved,   abused   the   plaintiff
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                              3</span>

and   procured   his   signatures   on   the  blank   papers   and   handed   over   the

same to the defendant No.1, and they also threatened the plaintiff that in

case he did not pay Rs. 2 lakhs to the defendant No.1 within 2­3 days then

they will implicate him in the false criminal case and he will arrest the

plaintiff.     It   is   stated   that   the   defendant   No.1   served   a   legal   notice

through his counsel dated 17l.2.2005 upon the plaintiff calling upon him

to   pay   Rs.70,000/­   and   the   plaintiff   sent   an   appropriate   reply,   and

therefore, it was prayed that decree of injunction be passed in favour of

the plaintiff and against defendant No.1 restraining the defendants from

entering   the   premises   of   the   plaintiff   forcibly   with   a   view   to   cause

harassment, mental torture and by calling the appellant by bad names

and other near relatives and to lower the prestige of the plaintiff and to

use   the   filthy   and   abusive   language   against   the   appellant   outside   his

house and the adjoining public places and further the respondent No.2 be

restrained   from   calling   in   the   police   station   without   any   reason   and

without due process of law.
</p>
<p id="p_3">3              Defendants contested the claim of the plaintiff/appellant by

filing the separate written statements.  The defence of the defendant No.1

was that no cause of action had arisen for filing the suit as the plaintiff
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                             4</span>

had   categorically   admitted   before   SHO   P.S   Tilak   Nagar,   that   he   had

taken the loan and the matter was amicably settled between the plaintiff

and the defendants, and it was decided by the plaintiff that he will pay

Rs.2,00,000/­ to the defendant, and the plaintiff paid Rs.1,30,000/­ in the

month   of   April   2004,   and   he   has   still   to   pay   balance   amount   of

Rs.70,000/­,   which   fact   he   has   concealed   from   the   court,   and   the

allegations   regarding   the   abuse   and   black­mailing   etc.   have   been

vehemently denied. The allegation of threat have also been denied.  

4      The defendant No.2 in the written statement has also denied the

allegations made in the plaint and it was also averred that the suit was

not maintainable, as no prior notice U/S 140 of <a href="/doc/190803/" id="a_1">Delhi Police Act</a> had been

given for instituting the present suit, and the allegations regarding the

alleged harassment etc. to the plaintiff has been vehemently denied.

5      Vide   detailed   order   dated   1.8.2006,   the   ld.   Civil   J   dismissed   the

application U/O 39 Rule 1 &amp; 2 CPC of the plaintiff by observing as under:­


       "On   the   other   hand   counsel   for   defendant   no.1   has
submitted that the plaintiff and defendant no. 1 were friends and
the  defendant  no.1  has to  recover  a  sum of Rs.70,000/­  from the
plaintiff.  The prayer of the plaintiff in the interim application is
such   that   the   court   cannot   supervise   the   same   if   the   relief   as
prayed for is granted.   Moreover, the defendant No.2 in any case
has to perform his duty in accordance with law.  At this stage I do
not see any prima facie case in favour of plaintiff and accordingly
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                              5</span>

the application under consideration is hereby dismissed."


6      I   have   heard   ld.   counsel   for   the   appellant,   ld.   counsel   for   the

respondents and perused the record.   I have also perused the aforesaid

order of ld. trial court.   The ld. trial court has rightly observed that the

relief   sought   by   the   plaintiff   cannot   be   granted,   as   the   court   cannot

supervise the said reliefs, if the same are granted, and further there is one

more   reason   why   the   reliefs   prayed   for,   by   the   appellant   cannot   be

granted since the respondent No.2 has to perform his duty in accordance

with   law,   and   if   the   respondent   No.2   or   his   staff   breaches   or   the

respondent   No.1   contravenes   any   law   by   forcibly   entering   into   the

premises of the appellant then they will be committing an offence under

the Indian Penal, Code and they are open to prosecution, if they cause any

harassment, mental torture by calling the appellant with bad names for

which   appellant   can   always   approach   the   higher   police   authorities   by

making a complaint in this regard and he can also file a complaint before

the concerned   magistrate for the offences committed by the respondent

No.2.     Similarly,   if   the   respondent   No.1   also   commits   the   said   acts   of

abuse,   harassment   and   mental   torture,   the   respondent   No.1   is   also

amenable   to   prosecution   for   which   a   complaint   can   be   filed   before   the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                               6</span>

police or before the higher police authorities or a complaint can also be

filed before the concerned magistrate.  However, the relief sought by the

plaintiff, as above cannot be granted by this court, as it is settled law that

the court will not ordinarily grant any relief, which it cannot be supervise.

Even   otherwise,   the   appellant   has   equally   efficacious   remedy   for   the

redressal   for   his   grievance   as   discussed   above.     Consequently,   he   has

failed   to   make   out   any   prima   case   for   grant   of   injunction,   neither   the

balance   of   convenience   lies   in   his   favour   and   he   will   not   suffer   any

irreparable   loss   &amp;     injury   either.   Accordingly,   appeal   of   the   appellant

stands  dismissed.    Trial  court   record  be  sent   back  alongwith  a  copy  of

judgment and appeal file be consigned to Record Room.

Announced in the open court on 17.08.2007.
