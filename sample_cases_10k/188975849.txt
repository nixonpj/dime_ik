<p id="p_14">Statements of Accused Persons:

19.08.2016, statements of accused persons under
<a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_14">Section 313</a> Cr.P.C were recorded wherein they
denied the correctness of all the incriminating
circumstances appearing in the evidence against

Sessions Case No. 56107/16                         Page 11/58
 them and stated that they were falsely implicated
by the IO in order to solve a blind and clueless
case.
</p><p id="p_16">10.     None of the accused persons desired to lead
evidence in his defence and accordingly, case was
listed for final arguments.
</p>

<p id="p_17">Final Arguments:
</p><p id="p_18">11.     I heard the arguments advanced by Ms. Reeta
Sharma, learned Additional Public Prosecutor for
the State,      Shri Arun Rathi, learned counsel for
accused persons namely, Sugreev Paswan and
Birja, Shri Kaptan Singh, learned counsel for
accused Harender Passi and Shri Tanvir Qaiser,
learned counsel for accused persons namely,
Haripal, Vinod &amp; Manoj. I also perused the entire
material available on record.
</p><p id="p_19">12.     During the course of arguments, learned
Additional Public Prosecutor argued that present is
a case based on circumstantial evidence and the
prosecution successfully proved the complete chain
of circumstances to prove the guilt of the accused
persons. Further, initially the case was registered
under <a href="/doc/1131784/" id="a_15">section 408</a> IPC therefore, no ill will can be

Sessions Case No. 56107/16                   Page 12/58
 imputed on the part of the IO of the case. All the
prosecution witnesses deposed consistently and
except some minor contradictions which are bound
to occur, there are no material contradictions in the
testimonies        of    prosecution   witnesses.    Ld.
Prosecutor further argued that the dead body of the
deceased as well as the stolen 60 oil drums were
recovered at the instance of accused Harender
Passi, Hari Pal Singh and Sugreev Paswan which
are admissible under <a href="/doc/1312051/" id="a_16">section 27</a> of the Evidence
Act. The accused persons were also duly identified
by prosecution witnesses though PW-4 wrongly
identified accused Manoj but the same is not fatal
to the prosecution's case as other PWs correctly
identified the accused persons. Further, the
prosecution proved the motive i.e. commission of
robbery on the part of the accused persons. No
suggestion was put to any public witness about any
enmity with the accused persons. Ld. Prosecutor
further argued that as per settled law, joint recovery
and joint disclousers are permissible in law. Lastly,
the learned Prosecutor argued that the prosecution
successfully proved its case beyond all reasonable
doubts and all the accused persons deserve

</p><p id="p_20">13.     Per contra, learned defence counsel argued
that there are not sufficient evidence available on
record against the accused persons and the
testimonies        of        prosecution   witnesses   are
contradictory with each other. Further, the IO of the
case did not examine the JCB operator or the plot
owner where the septic tank was situated. There are
contradictions in the testimonies of the prosecution
witnesses regarding identity of the accused persons.
Further, learned defence counsel submitted that in
all the cases based on circumstantial evidence, last
seen evidence is must which is lacking in the
present case and accordingly, the chain of the
circumstances pointing towards the guilt of the

Sessions Case No. 56107/16                        Page 14/58
 accused persons is not complete. He also argued
that joint recoveries are not permissible in law
which raises doubts on the entire prosecution story.

Sessions Case No. 56107/16                           Page 21/58
 information about his death, PW-7 reached at
mortuary of SGM Hospital, Mangol Puri, Delhi
where he identified the dead body vide his
statement Ex.PW-23/C. He also received the dead
body of his father vide memo Ex.PW-7/A.
</p><p id="p_42">18.     Rajnath Yadav (PW-4) who was running a
business of providing security services from his
office at Sultan Puri Delhi also identified the said
dead body to be one of the guards namely, Arjun
Mehto who was employed with him. The
complainant Rajesh Garg (PW-6), who was running
business of oil trading with a godown situated at
Marwari Tyre Wali Gali behind Metro yards,
Mundka also identified the said dead body to be of
security guard Arjun Mehto who was deployed for
security of the said godown.
</p><p id="p_43">19.     Dr. Manoj Dhingra (PW-1) had conducted
postmortem examination alongwith Dr. Deepak
Sharma on the dead body of Arjun @ Baba s/o
Dev Dhari Mehto on 08.01.2012. PW-1 found the
said dead body in a state of decomposition due to
which it had swollen and greenish colouration was
found present all over the body. Further, the skin of
the body was peeling off at places, maggots were

 found present on the body. Hair and skin were
coming out on pulling, teeth were loose and
marbling of skin was also present.       PW-1 also
found a laceration of 5x4 cm into bone deep present
over right frontal region of the head. Internal
injuries in head, neck and chest and fracture of 2nd
to 5th ribs on left side and 3rd and 4th rib on right
side were also found. PW-1 proved the postmortem
examination report Ex.PW-1/A. The cause of death
was opined to be due to cerebral damage and
asphyxia consequent upon the head injury and
strangulation.
</p><p id="p_44">20.     In view of the testimonies of above-
mentioned prosecution witnesses, it is evident that
the afore-mentioned dead body was of Arjun Mehto
@ Baba s/o Dev Dhari Mehto. As per postmortem
examination report Ex.PW-1/A, the deceased had
died due to cerebral damage and asphyxia on
sustaining head injury as well as strangulation,
which establish that the injuries sustained by
deceased were sufficient to cause death in ordinary
course of nature. Apparently, the death of the
deceased was homicidal. As per the prosecution
case, the dead body was found inside a septic tank

 with     injuries     as     mentioned   in   postmortem
examination report Ex.PW-1/A, therefore, the
possibility of death of the deceased being
accidental or suicidal is completely ruled out.

employed as a security guard and was on night duty

Sessions Case No. 56107/16                  Page 25/58
 on 22.12.2011 at the said godown of the
complainant. The deposition of PW-4 and PW-6 is
categorical in this regard. Though PW-4 could not
produce any document to show that the deceased
was working with him for the last about 2 years
from the date of incident, his testimony remained
intact in this regard. Furthermore, PW-6 in his
cross-examination also stated that the deceased was
hired from the security agency and he had also
documents to show about the employment of the
deceased as security guard with him. PW-6 further
stated that he had given the monthly bill of the
security agency to the police and could also
produce the same. PW-6 was not asked by the
learned      defence         counsel   to   produce      those
documents. PW-6 further stated in categorical terms
that when he left the godown on 22.12.2011 in the
evening nobody else except the deceased remained
present in the godown. The testimony of PW-6
could not be contradicted in any manner in this
regard. Rather, one FIR Ex. PW-2/A under <a href="/doc/1131784/" id="a_25">section
408</a> IPC was got registered by PW-6 vide his
statement Ex.PW-6/A whereby he raised doubt on

transformer oil when PW-6 reached there on the
next day.

deposed about recording of theft of oil drums in the
computer network, on 23.12.2011 at about 12.33
p.m. The said information was transmitted to
concerned PCR. PW-3 also produced the PCR form
Ex.PW-3/A in this regard. Further, HC Sudesh
(PW-5) deposed about receiving wireless message
from the district control room on 23.12.2011 at
about 12.40 p.m regarding theft of oil drums which
was recorded by him vide DD No. 17A (EX.PW-
5/A). HC Dayanand (PW-2) deposed about
receiving a rukka from Ct. Vishram on 23.12.2011
at about 5.45 p.m            on the basis of which he
registered FIR Ex.PW-2/A under <a href="/doc/1131784/" id="a_26">section 408</a> IPC.
PW-2 had also made endorsement Ex.PW-2/B on
the said rukka. Raj Nath Yadav (PW-4)             also
deposed about the missing of the deceased as well
as oil drums from the said godown of the
complainant. SI Azad Singh (PW-9) had reached at
the said godown alongwith photographer and finger

HC Udham Singh (PW-11), who had also
accompanied ASI Azad Singh (PW-9), one empty
bottle of plastic with "Goldee" printed on it was
found lying in between the drums. PW-11 had lifted
2 chance prints from the same which were sent to

Rajesh Garg (PW-6) and was on         duty in the
intervening night of 22/23.12.2011. In the morning
of 23.12.2011 when PW-6 reached at his godown,
the deceased as well as 60 drums containing

<p id="p_61">(B). Arrest of accused persons
</p><p id="p_62">28.     As far as the arrest of the accused persons
namely, Harender Passi, Hari Pal Singh and
Sugreev Paswan is concerned, the testimonies of SI
Dinesh (PW-15), HC Satyawan (PW-14), Ct.
Neeraj Kumar (PW-18) and HC Mahender Singh
(PW-19) are relevant.
</p><p id="p_63">29.     As per the testimonies of the afore-
mentioned prosecution witnesses, on 06.01.2012 on
receipt of secret information the afore-mentioned
prosecution witnesses reached at Mundka Industrial
area where accused Harender Passi, Hari Pal Singh
and Sugreev Paswan were arrested at the instance
of a secret informer, who were standing infront of
godown of one Munna Lal . The accused persons
were arrested vide arrest memo Ex.PW-14/A,

Sessions Case No. 56107/16                 Page 29/58
 Ex.PW-14/B and Ex.PW-14/C respectively. Their
personal search was conducted vide memo Ex.PW-
14/D, Ex.PW-14/E and Ex.PW-14/F. Thereafter,
PW-15 recorded their disclouser statements Ex.PW-
14/G, Ex.PW-14/H and Ex.PW-14/I. Further, SHO
Inspector Ramesh Chand Bhardwaj (PW-23) was
informed by PW-15 in this regard who also reached
at the said spot. Complainant Rajesh Garg (PW-6)
and Raj Nath Yadav (PW-4) were called who also
reached at the spot.
</p><p id="p_64">30.     The       testimonies   of   afore-mentioned
prosecution witnesses regarding receiving secret
information, proceeding to the Mundka Industrial
Area in pursuance thereof and arrest of the afore-
mentioned three accused persons at the instance of
secret informer remained intact in their respective
cross-examination and no material contradiction
could be brought forth by the learned defence
counsel. During arguments, it was submitted by the
learned defence counsel that Raj Nath Yadav (PW-
</p><p id="p_65">4) wrongly identified accused Manoj which raises
doubt on the prosecution case. I am not satisfied
with the submissions of the learned defence
counsel. It was held in Simon (supra) case that

Sessions Case No. 56107/16                  Page 30/58
 wrong identification by one witness is not fatal to
the case of prosecution by itself. Moreover, Rajesh
Garg (PW-6), ASI Satyawan (PW-14), SI Dinesh
(PW-15),       Ct.    Neeraj       Kumar    (PW-18),    HC
Mohinder Singh (PW-19) and ACP Ramesh
Chander (PW-23) duly identified all the three
accused persons and their respective testimonies
could not be contradicted in this regard. In cross-
examination, learned defence counsel asked about
the sequence of making arrest and personal search
of the accused persons as well as about not joining
any public witness while making arrest. In this
regard, suffice it to say that all the three accused
persons      were       arrested      simultaneously    and,
therefore, the sequence of making arrest is of no
significance. As per settled propositions of law,
absence of any public witness at the time of arrest
of the accused person is also not fatal to the
prosecution case if the testimonies of police
witnesses are not contradictory. A police witness is
also equally competent witness and absence of any
public witness in the proceedings conducted does
not make the testimony of such police witness less
credible.     Further,       though    PW-14    could   not

Sessions Case No. 56107/16                         Page 31/58
 remember the registration number of private
vehicle used by them to reach at the godown of
Munna Lal, PW-18 stated about the use of three
different motorcycles to reach at the said spot
whereas PW-19 stated about the use of Hyundai i10
car belonging to SI Dinesh Kumar (PW-15), the
deposition of prosecution witnesses cannot be
construed to be contradictory with each other, more
so, when the other facts deposed by them could not
be contradicted in any respect. It was also held in
B.K      Channappa           (supra)   case   that      such
contradictions are bound to occur in the statements
of the prosecution witnesses who depose in the
court after substantial period of time. As far as the
discrepancies pointed out by the counsel for the
accused in the testimonies of the prosecution
witnesses and the infirmities in carrying out the
investigation are concerned, suffice it to say that as
per the settled propositions of law on the subject,
minor discrepancies not going to the root of the
case, do not affect and are not fatal to the
prosecution's case. Hon'ble Supreme Court in
<a href="/doc/207774/" id="a_28">Bharwada Bhoginbhai Hirjibhai V. State of Gujarat</a>
(AIR 1983 SC 753) considered the defence

Sessions Case No. 56107/16                           Page 32/58
 argument about discrepancies in the evidence and
observed as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_4">         "5............Over  much      importance
         cannot be attached to minor
         discrepancies. The reasons are
         obvious:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">         (1) By and large a witness cannot be
         expected to possess a photographic
         memory and to recall the details of an
         incident. It is not as if a video tape is
         replayed on the mental screen.
         (2) ordinarily it so happens that a
         witness is overtaken by events. The
         witness could not have anticipated the
         occurrence which so often has an
         element of surprise. The mental
         facilities therefore cannot be expected
         to be attuned to absorb the details.
         (3) The powers of observation differ
         from person to person. What one may
         notice, another may not. An object or
         movement might emboss its image on
         one person's mind whereas it might go
         unnoticed on the part of another.
         (4) By and large people cannot
         accurately recall a conversation and
         reproduce the very words used by them
         or heard by them. They can only recall
         the main purport of the conversation. It
         is unrealistic to expect a witness to be
         a human tape recorder.</blockquote>
<p id="p_66">         (5) In regard to exact time of an
         incident, or the time duration of an
         occurrence, usually, people make their
         estimates by guess work on the spur of
         the moment 1.1 at the time of
         interrogation. And one cannot expect

Sessions Case No. 56107/16                           Page 33/58
          people to make very precise or reliable
         estimate in such matters. Again, it
         depends on the time-sense of
         individuals which varies from person
         to person.
</p><p id="p_67">         (6) Ordinarily a witness cannot be
         expected to recall accurately the
         sequence of events which take place in
         rapid succession or in a short time
         span. A witness is liable to get
         confused, or mixed up when
         interrogated later on.
</p><p id="p_68">         (7) A witness, though wholly truthful, is
         liable to be overawed by the court
         atmosphere and the piercing cross
         examination made by counsel and out
         of nervousness mix up facts, get
         confused regarding sequence of events,
         or fill up details from imagination on
         the spur of the moment. The sub-
</p><p id="p_69">         conscious mind of the witness
         sometimes so operates on account of
         the fear of looking foolish or being
         disbelieved though the witness is
         giving a truthful and honest account of
         the occurrence witnessed by him-
         Perhaps it is a sort of a psychological
         defence mechanism activated on the
         spur of moment".
</p>

<p id="p_70">31.     In view of above-mentioned law laid down
by the Apex Court, by no stretch of imagination
such contradiction can be held as going to the root




Sessions Case No. 56107/16                           Page 34/58
 of the prosecution case so as to discard the entire
testimonies of the witnesses.
</p><p id="p_71">32.     In view of the testimonies of afore-
mentioned prosecution witnesses, it is evident that
all the three accused persons namely, Harender
Passi, Hari Pal Singh and Sugreev Paswan were
arrested on 06.01.2012 from infront of godown of
Munna Lal situated in Mundka Industrial Area. The
prosecution          therefore,   also   established
circumstance no. (iv) beyond reasonable doubt.

<p id="p_72">(C). Recovery of dead body and 60 oil drums
</p><p id="p_73">33.     On scrutiny of testimonies of SI Dinesh (PW-
</p><p id="p_74">15), HC Satyawan (PW-14), Ct. Neeraj Kumar
(PW-18), HC Mahender Singh (PW-19), Raj Nath
Yadav (PW-4) Rajesh Garg (PW-6) and ACP
Ramesh Chander (PW-23), it is revealed that
pursuant to the disclouser statements Ex.PW-14/G,
Ex.PW-14/G and Ex.PW-14/I, accused persons
namely, Harender Passi, Hari Pal Singh and
Sugreev Paswan led the police party to a septic tank
situated in the same gali in which godown of PW-6
was situated. PW-23 peeped into the hole of the
said septic tank to find dead body of a male person

Sessions Case No. 56107/16                  Page 35/58
 inside the said tank which was about 15 feet deep.
One JCB machine was called at the said spot and
the concrete cover (slab) of the septic tank was got
removed through the said JCB machine and a
decomposed dead body of a male was taken out of
the said septic tank. The said dead body was duly
identified by both PW-4 and PW-6 to be of the
deceased.
</p><p id="p_75">34.     In their respective cross-examination, all the
above-mentioned prosecution witnesses deposed
consistently with regard to recovery of decomposed
dead body of the deceased from inside the septic
tank at the instance of the accused persons namely,
Harender Passi, Hari Pal Singh and Sugreev
Paswan. Such recovery of the dead body at the
instance of the said accused persons is covered
within the definition of "fact discovered" so as to
come within the purview of <a href="/doc/1312051/" id="a_29">section 27</a> of the
Evidence Act and is a relevant fact. No
contradiction worth the name of it could be brought
in the testimonies of afore-mentioned prosecution
witnesses by the learned defence counsel in this
regard.
</p>

<p id="p_76">Sessions Case No. 56107/16                    Page 36/58
</p><p id="p_77"> 35.     As far as the submission of learned defence
counsel that the owner of the plot where the said
septic tank was situated and the JCB operator were
not made a witness in the present case, is
concerned, in view of unrebutted testimonies of
prosecution witnesses, this submission does not
hold much ground. With regard to discrepancies in
evidence and lapses in investigation, Hon'ble
Supreme court in its judgment titled as <a href="/doc/113267195/" id="a_30">Yogesh
Singh v. Mahabeer Singh &amp; Anrs</a> AIR 2016 SC
5160 laid down that if the evidence is incredible
and cannot be accepted by the test of prudence,
then it may create a dent in the prosecution version.
Further, it needs no special emphasis to state that
every omission cannot take place of a material
omission and, therefore, minor contradiction,
inconsistencies or insignificant embellishments do
not affect the core of the prosecution case and
should not be taken to be a ground to reject the
prosecution evidence. The Apex Court, relying
upon <a href="/doc/1438332/" id="a_31">C. Muniappan &amp; Ors v. State of Tamilnadu</a>
AIR 2010 SC 3718 further laid down that there
may be highly defective investigation in a case.
However, it is to be examined as to whether there is

Sessions Case No. 56107/16                   Page 37/58
 any lapse by the IO and whether due to such lapse
any benefit should be given to the accused. The law
on this issue is well settled that the defect in the
investigation by itself cannot be a ground for
acquittal. Further, where there has been negligence
on the part of the investigating agency or omissions
etc which resulted in defective investigation, there
is a legal obligation on the part of the Court to
examine the prosecution evidence dehors such
lapses, carefully, to find out whether the said
evidence is reliable or not and to what extent it is
reliable and as to whether such lapses affected the
object of finding out the truth.
</p><p id="p_78">36.     In view of the above-mentioned settled
propositions of law          regarding contradictions in
testimonies of prosecution witnesses and defective
investigation, I do not find any merit in the
contentions of the learned counsel for the accused
persons. The contradiction brought forth in the
testimonies of prosecution witnesses are minor
contradictions which do not go to the root of the
prosecution case. Such contradictions in the
testimonies of the prosecution witnesses are but


Sessions Case No. 56107/16                      Page 38/58
 natural, which may creep in when the prosecution
witnesses are examined after a gap of time.
</p><p id="p_79">37.     Even otherwise, HC Devender Kumar (PW-
</p><p id="p_80">12) proved the photographs Ex.PW-12/A25 to
Ex.PW-12/A48 with their negatives Ex.PW-12/A1
to Ex.PW-12/A24 wherein a JCB machine is
clearly visible in use while breaking the concrete
cover (slab) of the said septic tank and thereby
leaving no room to raise any doubt in this regard.
Needless to say, the presence of PW-4 and PW-6
during proceedings of recovery of dead body of the
deceased from inside the septic tank, at the instance
of the said accused persons, also lend credence to
the testimonies of other police witnesses.
</p><p id="p_81">38.     During the course of arguments, learned
defence counsel also submitted that if the JCB
machine was used to lift the concrete cover (slab)
of the septic tank, it was not possible for the
accused persons to lift the same and to throw the
dead body inside it. He further argued that as per
the prosecution version, all the said three accused
persons got the dead body recovered jointly which
is not permissible in law. I do not find any merit in
such contentions. As is clear from the photographs

Sessions Case No. 56107/16                    Page 39/58
 Ex.PW-12/A25 to Ex.PW-12/A48, that there were
two big open spaces in the slab of the spetic tank
which usually are covered separately. PW-23 had
peeped inside the tank from such open space. PW-
14 and PW-15 also categorically deposed about the
hole/space in the cemented cover of the septic tank
and it can be easily inferred that the dead body, in
all probability, would have been thrown through
such open space/hole, inside the tank. The broken
ribs of the dead body, observed vide postmortem
examination report Ex.PW-1/A further strengthen
this. With regard to joint recoveries, Learned
prosecutor also pertinently relied upon Kishore
Bhadke (supra) case wherein it was held in
categorical terms that joint recovery at the instance
of two or more accused persons is admissible in
evidence. <a href="/doc/1769219/" id="a_32">In State (NCT of Delhi) v. Navjot Sandhu</a>
(2005) 11 SCC 600, the law laid down regarding
joint recoveries is relevant to be referred which is
as under:
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_6">        "Joint disclosures, to be more accurate,
        simultaneous disclosures, per se, are not
        inadmissible under Section 27. 'A person
        accused' need not necessarily be a single

Sessions Case No. 56107/16                     Page 40/58
         person, but it could be plurality of
        accused. In fact, joint or simultaneous
        disclosure is a myth, because two or more
        accused persons would not have uttered
        informatory words in a chorus. At best,
        one person would have made the
        statement orally and the other person
        would have stated so substantially in
        similar terms a few seconds or minutes
        later, or the second person would have
        given unequivocal nod to what has been
        said by the first person. Or, two persons
        in custody may be interrogated separately
        and simultaneously and both of them may
        furnish similar information leading to the
        discovery of fact. Or, in rare cases, both
        the accused may reduce the information
        into writing and hand over the written
        notes to the police officer at the same
        time. We do not think that such
        disclosures by two or more persons in
        police custody go out of the purview of
        Section 27 altogether. If information is
        given one after the other without any
        break almost simultaneously, and if such
        information is followed up by pointing
        out the material thing by both of them,
        we find no good reason to eschew such
        evidence from the regime of Section 27."

<p id="p_82">39.     With regard to the recovery of 60 drums
containing transformer oil which were kept in a
plot situated in the street adjoining Ranbir Dharam
Kanta at the instance of said accused persons, the


Sessions Case No. 56107/16                      Page 41/58
 testimonies        of        afore-mentioned   prosecution
witnesses except HC Mahender Singh (PW-19) and
Raj Nath Yadav (PW-4), could not be impeached in
any material terms. Both PW-4 and PW-19 are not
a witness of such recovery. Rajesh Garg (PW-6)
also witnessed the seizure memo Ex.PW-6/G
whereby the said drums were seized. PW-6
identified those drums vide photographs Ex.P1,

were seized vide seizure memo Ex.PW-6/H.
</p><p id="p_83">40.      With regard to the judgments relied on by the
learned defence counsel, it suffice to say that all the
judgments reiterate the already settled propositions
of law regarding essentials to be looked for in a
case based on circumstantial evidence which were
laid down by the Apex Court in its celebrated
judgment <a href="/doc/1505859/" id="a_33">Sharad Biridhichand Sarda v. State of
Maharashtra</a> AIR 1984 SC 1622 (1).
</p><p id="p_84">41.      In the above-discussed circumstances, it is
evident that the prosecution successfully proved the
circumstance no. (v) and (vi) beyond reasonable
doubt.
</p>

<p id="p_85">Sessions Case No. 56107/16                        Page 42/58
 (D). Possession of 60 oil drums with accused
Birja.
</p><p id="p_86">42.      In order to prove the circumstance that
accused Birja had purchased 60 oil drums from the
accused persons and kept the same at the plot from
where the said drums were recovered at the
instance of accused persons namely, Harender
Passi, Hari Pal Singh and Sugreev Paswan, the
prosecution got examined Omvir Lakra (PW-8)
who deposed that accused Birja had approached
him for taking his plot no.4 situated in Khasra no.
752/2 Mundka on rent which he had rented out to
accused Birja on a monthly rent of Rs. 4000/-.
Besides the oral testimony of PW-8, there is no
other evidence available on record to show if the
said plot was owned by PW-8 or was indeed rented
out by him to accused Birja. In cross-examination,
PW-8 admitted that he was not having any
documentary proof regarding such tenancy. PW-8
had also not informed to the police when enquiries
were made from him that accused Birja was his
tenant. PW-8 had never issued any rent receipt to
accused Birja.
</p>
<p id="p_87">Sessions Case No. 56107/16                 Page 43/58
</p><p id="p_88"> 43.     From the testimony of PW-8, it is not clear
what was the duration of such tenancy or if there
was any written or even oral agreement qua such
tenancy. PW-8 did not depose for what purpose
accused Birja had taken the said plot on rent.
</p><p id="p_89">44.     In the given circumstances, in my considered
opinion, there is no legally admissible evidence
available on record to establish that the plot from
where the said 60 oil drums were recovered, was
under the tenancy of accused Birja. Admittedly,
accused Birja was not arrested from the said plot at
the time of recovery of oil drums. In these
circumstances, it is clear that the prosecution could
not establish the circumstance no. (vii) that accused
Birja had purchased the said oil drums from the
accused persons and had kept them in the said plot.
</p><p id="p_90">45.     During arguments, another contention made
by the learned defence counsel was that in all cases
of circumstantial evidence, the "last seen" evidence
assumes significance which is lacking in the
present case and, therefore, the prosecution story is
not worth believable. I do not find any force or
merit in the contention of learned defence counsel.
The law is settled that "last seen" evidence is but

Sessions Case No. 56107/16                   Page 44/58
 one circumstance in a case based on circumstantial
evidence and the absence of "last seen" evidence
does not make the case of the prosecution weak so
as to absolve the accused persons. In Pradeep @
Sanjay (supra) case relied upon by the learned
Prosecutor, it was also held that in cases based on
circumstantial        evidence,   conviction   can   be
sustained even in the absence of such "last seen"
evidence.
</p><p id="p_91">46.     To sum up, in view of the above discussion,
following circumstances have been proved by the
prosecution beyond reasonable doubt:
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_7">         (i). Deceased was employed as a
         security guard at the godown of the
         complainant situated in Marwari Tyre

          Singh and Sugreev Paswan were arrested
         on the basis of secret information.

</p>
<p id="p_95">47.     However, the prosecution could not establish
the circumstance that the 60 drums containing
transformer oil were purchased by accused Birja
from the accused persons who had retained them in
the said plot.
</p>

<p id="p_96">Motive:
</p><p id="p_97">48.     From the scrutiny of entire material available
on record, it is also evident that the prosecution
successfully proved the motive on the part of
accused persons namely, Harender Passi, Hari Pal
Singh and Sugreev Paswan i.e. committing robbery
of drums containing transformer oil from the
godown of Rajesh Garg (PW-6). At the instance of


Sessions Case No. 56107/16                    Page 46/58
 said     accused     persons,     60 drums        containing
transformer oil were also recovered which further
strengthen the prosecution version.
</p><p id="p_98">49.     Let us now discuss the essential ingredients
of offences with which the accused persons have
been charged with vis a vis the circumstances
proved on record.
</p>

<p id="p_99"><a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_34">Section 302</a>/<a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_35">34</a> IPC:

         death, or imprisonment for life and shall also
         be liable to fine.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_101">51.     The relevant part of <a href="/doc/626019/" id="a_36">Section 300</a> IPC which
defines 'Murder' reads as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_11">         300. Murder- Except in the cases

         murder, if the act by which the death is

<p id="p_102">Sessions Case No. 56107/16                           Page 47/58
         Thirdly- If it is done with the intention of
        causing bodily injury to any person and the
        bodily injury intended to be inflicted is
        sufficient in the ordinary course of nature

</p><p id="p_103">        Fourthly- If the person committing the act

        death, and commits such act without any
        excuse for incurring the risk of causing
        death or such injury is aforesaid.
</p>

<p id="p_104">52.     Further, the relevant part of <a href="/doc/305371/" id="a_37">Section 299</a> IPC
which      defines      "Culpable    homicide",         having
reference in the definition of 'Murder' reads as
follows:
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_13">         299.Culpable homicide - Whoever causes
         death by doing an act with the intention of
         causing death, or with the intention of
         causing such bodily injury as is likely to
         cause death, commits the offence of
         culpable homicide.
</blockquote>

<p id="p_105">53.     In the present case, accused persons namely,
Harender Passi, Hari Pal Singh, Sugreev Paswan,
Vinod and Manoj have been charged with
commission of offence punishable under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_38">section
302</a>/<a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_39">34</a> IPC. In the light of above-discussed facts
and circumstances, it is evident that the prosecution

Sessions Case No. 56107/16                          Page 48/58
 could successfully prove     all the circumstances
against accused Harender Passi, Hari Pal Singh and
Sugreev Paswan only. There is no legally
admissible evidence available on record to connect
accused Vinod and accused Manoj with the
commission of offence u/s 302 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_40">IPC</a>. As per record,
after their respective surrender before the court,
accused Vinod and Manoj were interrogated and
disclouser statement Ex.PW-23/H        of accused
Vinod only was recorded. IO had also prepared the
pointing out memo Ex.PW-23/J, Ex.PW-23/K and
Ex.PW-23/L at the instance of accused Vinod.
Needless to say such disclouser statement and
pointing out memos in respect of accused Vinod
are not admissible in evidence being hit by <a href="/doc/523607/" id="a_41">section
162</a> Cr.P.C. Besides, the said disclouser statement
and pointing out memos, no other evidence is
available on record against accused persons
namely, Vinod and Manoj to indicate their
involvement in commission of murder of the
deceased. Even the disclouser statement of accused
Manoj was not revealed by the IO.
</p><p id="p_106">54.     As far as the involvement of accused
Harender Passi, Hari Pal Singh and Sugreev

Sessions Case No. 56107/16                 Page 49/58
 Paswan in commission of murder of the deceased is
concerned, all the circumstances sought to be
proved by the prosecution against them have been
proved beyond reasonable doubt which also make
the chain of circumstances complete. None of the
accused persons led any evidence in their
respective defence so as to infer otherwise.
Accordingly, accused Harender Passi, Hari Pal
Singh and Sugreev are held guilty for commission
of offence of murder of the deceased in furtherance
of their common intention which is punishable
under <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_42">section 302</a>            read with <a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_43">section 34</a> IPC.

<p id="p_109">55.     In view of above-discussed facts and
circumstances, accused Harender Passi, Hari Pal
Singh and Sugreev Paswan are also held guilty for
causing disappearance of evidence of offence in
order to screen themselves from legal punishment
as the prosecution successfully proved that all the
above-said three accused persons, after committing
murder of the deceased, in furtherance of their
common intention, had thrown the dead body into
a septic tank which could not have been discovered
but for the information provided by all the three
accused persons. As discussed above, discovery of
dead body of the deceased from inside the septic
tank, pursuant to their disclouser statements is
relevant under <a href="/doc/1312051/" id="a_48">section 27</a> of the Evidence Act.
Accused persons Vinod and Manoj could not be
connected even with the discovery of dead body of
the deceased in any manner. Accordingly, accused

</p>

<p id="p_113">57.     The definition of dacoity as stipulated under

         more, every person so committing,
         attempting or aiding, is said to commit
         "dacoity".
</blockquote>

<p id="p_114">58.     It is thus, clear that for commission of
dacoity, there must be five or more persons
involved in commission of offence. In the light of
above-discussed circumstances, it is clear that the
prosecution could not establish that five or more
accused persons were involved in commission of
murder of the deceased. As observed above, there is
no evidence available on record to connect the
accused persons namely, Vinod and Manoj with
commission of any offence in the present case.
</p>

<p id="p_115">Sessions Case No. 56107/16                      Page 53/58
 Therefore, in my considered opinion, commission

         any stolen property, the possession
         whereof he knows or has reason to
         believe to have been transferred by the
         commission of dacoity, or dishonestly
         receives from a person, whom he knows
         or has reason to believe to belong or to
         have belonged to a gang of dacoits,
         property which he knows or has reason to
         believe to have been stolen, shall be
         punished with [imprisonment for life], or
         with rigorous imprisonment for a term
         which may extend to ten years, and shall
         be liable to fine.
</p>
<p id="p_124">62.     As per the settled propositions of law, the
essential ingredients for commission of offence
under <a href="/doc/844968/" id="a_68">section 412</a> IPC are that the person
dishonestly receives or retains any stolen property,
he knows or has reason to believe that the
possession of such stolen property have been
transferred by the commission of dacoity or he
dishonestly receives such property from a person
whom he knows or has reason to believe to belong
or to have belonged to a gang of dacoits.
</p><p id="p_125">63.     As     discussed     above,   the   prosecution
miserably failed to prove circumstance no. (vii)

 regarding purchase and possession of 60 oil drums
by accused Birja. The prosecution could not
establish that it was accused Birja who had retained
60 oil drums which were recovered from a vacant
plot at the instance of accused Harender Passi, Hari
Pal Singh and Sugreev Paswan.          There is no
evidence available on record to indicate towards
any knowledge on the part of accused Birja that
said 60 drums containing transformer oil were
transferred by the commission of dacoity or
accused Birja received the said drums from any
person who belonged to a gang of dacoits. There is
practically nil evidence to hold accused Birja guilty
for commission of offence under <a href="/doc/844968/" id="a_69">section 412</a> IPC.
In fact the prosecution could not lead sufficient
evidence to hold accused Birja guilty even for
commission of offence under <a href="/doc/812083/" id="a_70">section 411</a> IPC.
Accordingly, accused Birja is acquitted of the
charge for the offence punishable under <a href="/doc/844968/" id="a_71">section 412</a>
IPC.

decided accordingly.
