AWARD UNDER SECTION 166  &amp; 140   OF THE M.V. ACT,1988



1      Vide  this award, I shall dispose off the claim of the petitioners   i.e. 

petitioner   no.1   wife   of   Sh.   Bhagat   Singh   (for   short   'the     deceased'), 

petitioners no.2 &amp; 3 , children of deceased &amp; petitioners no. 4 &amp; 5  parents 

of deceased claiming compensation to the extent of Rs.1 crore against the 

respondents i.e. respondent no. 1, the driver  of vehicle bearing no.  HR 51 T 

6501 (for short 'the offending vehicle') &amp; the respondent no.2  the Insurance 

Company   of   the   offending   vehicle   on   the   ground   of   death   of   deceased 

caused due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1.  



2.             Brief facts as stated by the petitioner in the petition are that on 

12.1.2006 at about 10.30 a.m, the  deceased was travelling in Motor Cycle 

'Pulsar'   registration   number   of   which   was   still   'applied   for'     and   he   was 

                                                               Vimlesh Vs Mahender Singh
                                             3/16

driving the vehicle by observing the traffic rules and when he reached at 

Suraj Kund Road, near MUN School, the offending vehicle being driven by 

the respondent no.1  in rash and negligent manner came from opposite side 

and hit the motorcycle of the deceased due to which deceased fell down on 

the road side and died after few hours.  The said accident was caused due to 

rash and negligent driving of the respondent no.1  and same could have been 

avoided   if   the   respondent   no.1   would   have   been   driving   the   vehicle   by 

observing the traffic rules and would not have been driving the same rashly 

and negligently. It is further submitted that   FIR bearing no.23/06 at PS­

Faridabad u/s.279/304A <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_1">IPC</a> was registered against respondent no. 1 and the 

deceased was initially removed to Escort Hospital, Faridabad where doctors 

attended   the   deceased   immediately   but   the   injuries   on   the   person   of   the 

deceased proved fatal,  and it is further stated that the petitioners spent Rs.1 

lac on treatment of the deceased from 12.1.06 to 13.1.06.   It is stated that 

deceased at the time of accident/death was 25 years of age and was earning 

an   amount   of   Rs.40,000/­   by   farming   at     his   own   agriculture   land,   by 

supplying   building   material   and   also   he   himself   was   running   a   private 

school   at   Village   Mandavas,   Gurgaon.     It   is   further   submitted   that 

petitioners,   on account of untimely death of the deceased,   have suffered 

great loss, mental pain and agony and as such a compensation to the tune of 


                                                             Vimlesh Vs Mahender Singh
                                             4/16

Rs.1 crore with interest  is being sought against all the respondents.



3.             Respondent no.1 has filed written statement taking preliminary 

objection that petition is not maintainable in the present form. Petitioners 

have got no locus standi to file the present petition. There is no cause of 

action   and   the   present   petition   has  only   been  filed   just   to  harass  and  to 

humiliate the answering respondent.  On merits,  facts are denied for want 

of knowledge. The facts with respect to   age and earning capacity of the 

deceased  are  also denied and it is averred that the petitioners be put to strict 

proof thereof. The registration of the FIR is denied and it is submitted that 

the same is false. It is specifically denied that the offending vehicle was 

being driven in   rash and negligent manner rather it is submitted that the 

deceased himself was driving his motor cycle rashly and negligently. It is 

further denied that the deceased was admitted in Escorts Hospital and died 

because of the said accident.   The claim is stated to be highly exaggerated, 

exorbitant, unreasonable and without any basis. It is further submitted that 

the offending vehicle was insured with the respondent no.2 and the liability, 

if any, is of the respondent no.2 and even otherwise he was having the valid 

D/L on the date of the accident.

4.             Respondent no.2( inadvertently mentioned as respondent no.3 


                                                              Vimlesh Vs Mahender Singh
                                                5/16

and it shall be read as respondent no.2)  has filed separate written statement 

taking preliminary objections that there is no cause of action for filing the 

present   petition  against   the answering respondent  as respondent  no.1 has 

denied   the   accident   and   it   further   submitted   that   in   case   the   accident   is 

proved, even then the answering respondent would not be liable to make any 

compensation, until and unless it is proved that driver was holding a valid 

driving  license  or that there is no violation of any terms and conditions of 

insurance policy.  It is further stated that the answering respondent is taking 

all the  defences u/s 170/ 149 of <a href="/doc/785258/" id="a_2">Motor Vehicle Act</a> and reserve its right to 

file amended written statement, if new facts are brought to the knowledge of 

answering respondent or if  it is found that petitioners are in collusion  with 

respondent no.1, the claim is stated to be highly exorbitant and it is  prayed 

that petition of the petitioner be dismissed against answering respondent.

        On merits, facts are denied for want of knowledge. Facts</pre><p id="p_1"> with respect 

to age and earning capacity of the deceased are also denied and it is stated 

that petitioners be put to strict proof thereof.   However, the fact that the 

offending vehicle was insured with respondent no.2 is not denied. The facts 

as explained with respect to happening of the accident are denied word by 

word.   The   interest   claimed   is   stated   to   be   on   the   higher   side   and   it   is 

submitted that in case the court comes to the conclusion that the petitioners 


                                                                 Vimlesh Vs Mahender Singh
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                           6/16</span>

are entitled for compensation, the interest may not be granted @ more than 

5.5 % p.a.  and it is prayed that the petition of the petitioner be dismissed. 



5      After completion of the pleadings, following   issues were framed  on 

12.5.07 which are as under:
</p>
<p id="p_2">      1       Whether the petitioners are the legal heirs of late Bhagat 
Singh   and   that   the   said   Bhagat   Singh   died   in   the   road   accident   dt.
12.1.06, within the jurisdiction of P.S NIT No.5, Faridabad, Haryana, 
due to the rash and negligent driving of vehicle no.HR 51 T 6501, by its 
driver? 
</p>
<p id="p_3">
</p><p id="p_4">        2    Whether the petitioners are entitled for any  compensation, 
If  so to what amount and from whom?
</p>
<pre id="pre_2">       3      Relief



6      Thereafter,   parties   were   given   opportunity   to   lead   their   evidence. 

Accordingly,  the petitioner no.1 has examined herself    as PW­1 and one 

</pre><p id="p_5">Devraj, the eye witness as P.W­2  and have closed their  evidence.



7      Thereafter opportunity was given to respondent no.2 to conclude its 

evidence but they have not led any evidence by stating that the documents 

have already been verified and as such they do not want to lead evidence. 

</p><p id="p_6">                                                          Vimlesh Vs Mahender Singh
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                       7/16</span>

Respondents' evidence was ultimately closed vide order dt.3.12.10.



8       I have heard the arguments and perused the record.  My issue­wise 

findings are as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_7">ISSUE NO.1:
</p>
<p id="p_8">9          The onus to prove this issue was upon the petitioners and they 

have to prove that they are the legal heirs of the deceased. To prove this fact, 

the petitioners have filed copy of ration card which includes the name of the 

deceased as well as of the petitioner no.1 &amp; petitioners no.4 &amp; 5. Name of 

the petitioners no.2 &amp; 3 are not on record. The respondent no.1 had taken 

this objection that the petitioners are not the legal heirs of the deceased but 

the petitioner no.1 has deposed that they are the legal heirs of the deceased. 

Said fact has been deposed in her affidavit. Respondent no.1 has not come 

forward to cross examine the P.Ws on this point. Therefore, it is held that 

the petitioners are the legal heirs of the deceased. 



10         To prove the second part of this issue,  the onus of this issue was 

upon the petitioners and they have to prove that the deceased died because 

of rash and negligent driving of the respondent no.1. To prove this fact, the 

petitioner no.1 has deposed in terms of the petition. P.W­2, the eye witness 


                                                        Vimlesh Vs Mahender Singh
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                           8/16</span>

has deposed in terms of the petition and he submits that on 12.1.06 at about 

10/10.30 a.m, he alongwith Surjeet was coming from Gurgaon to Delhi on 

his own two wheeler scooter and the deceased who was his relative was 

coming from Gurgaon and he was on bike and near MVN School, Surajkund 

Road, Faridabad, the offending vehicle which was coming from the front 

side and  was being driven in zig­zag manner,   hit the motorcycle of the 

deceased   and   due   to   that   impact   the   deceased   fell   down   and   sustained 

injuries.   They   stopped   the   car   i.e.the   offending   vehicle   and   took   the 

deceased in the same car to the Escorts Hospital and the police officials of 

P.S NIT, Faridabad also reached there and his statement was recorded. In 

cross examination by the respondent no.1 , he denied that he was not coming 

from Gurgaon to Delhi on his scooter or that the  offending vehicle was not 

driven by its driver in rash and negligent manner and hit the bike of the 

deceased. He denied that he did not take the deceased to the hospital but he 

admitted as correct that the deceased was his relative. He denied that he is 

deposing falsely. There is no cross examination on behalf of the respondent 

no.2. P.W­1 has filed certain documents i.e.copy of FIR and chargesheet. 

The FIR clearly reveals that the accident has happened with the car bearing 

no. HR 51­T 6501. Respondent no.1 in his written statement has admitted 

that the offending vehicle belongs to him. He has not given the name that if 


                                                           Vimlesh Vs Mahender Singh
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                                9/16</span>

he was not then who was driving the said offending vehicle. Therefore, it is 

proved that the offending vehicle was being driven by the respondent no.1 

himself in rash and negligent manner which has caused this accident. The 

post mortem report has also been filed on record which proves the cause of 

death   of   the   deceased   on   13.1.2006.  Therefore,   the   issue   is   decided   by 

holding   that     the   petitioners   are   the   legal   heirs   of   the   deceased   &amp;   the 

deceased had died in the road accident on 12.1.06  involving the offending 

vehicle being driven by the respondent no.1 in rash and negligent manner.</p><pre id="pre_3">



ISSUE NO.2 

11            Now, coming to the compensation aspect.

</pre><p id="p_9">              The court herein  has already held while disposing the issue no.1 

that deceased had died  due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1 

and   it   has   now   been   held   that   the   petitioners   are   the   legal   heirs   of   the 

deceased,   therefore,   they   are   entitled     for   compensation.      How   much 

compensation  petitioners are entitled to, depends upon various aspects in 

terms of Sarla Verma's judgment i.e. the income of the deceased, his age as 

well as his contribution towards family. 
</p>
<p id="p_10">

12            Now coming to the multiplier aspect. The age of the deceased in 

                                                                  Vimlesh Vs Mahender Singh
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                              10/16</span>

the petition is stated to be 25 years. As per his  Driving licence, his date of 

birth  is 7.11.80.  The accident has happened on 12.1.06. Therefore, the age 

of   the   deceased   would   be   26   years   on   the   date   of   the   accident   and   the 

relevant multiplier would be of 17.
</p>
<p id="p_11">

13           Now, coming to the income of the deceased. In the petition, it is 

submitted that the deceased was earning Rs.40,000/­p.m and he was running 

a private school. He was doing agriculture on his own land and he was doing 

work of supplying the building materials on the trucks of his brother and 

father. It is painfully observed by the court that none of these facts have 

been proved on record. The petitioner no.1 has filed a document showing 

that the deceased was having one cellphone. Statement of bank account has 

also   been   filed   as   issued   by   HDFC   Bank   for   the   period   from   5.4.05   to 

30.6.05. Fee slip of respondent no.2 &amp; 3   from one Amazon International 

School has been filed on record which does not bear the name of any person 

as to for whom this fee structure is, another receipt is filed on record issued 

by M/s Amazon  International  School  of Jesika  &amp; Preet  , children  of the 

deceased but they are for the period from October, 09 upto March, 2010 

whereas the accident has already occurred in 2006. Out of these documents, 

there is only one document which is relevant i.e.statement of account of the 

                                                                Vimlesh Vs Mahender Singh
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                           11/16</span>

HDFC Bank in the name of the deceased. Even this statement of account is 

pertaining   to   one   debit   card   &amp;it   reflects   that   the   deceased   had   been 

depositing   a   higher   amount   of   Rs.49,000/­,Rs.50,000/­,Rs.20,000/­,Rs.

10,000/­etc.but he is also withdrawing all this amount almost simultaneously 

and in the span of period i.e.5.4.05 to 30.6.05, he has around 53 debit counts 

and 12 credit counts &amp; he has withdrawn Rs.2,64,730/­whereas the deposit 

amount   was   2,60,415/­.This   in  no   way   reflects  as  to   what   would   be   the 

income of the deceased. It may however, show that the deceased was doing 

some business where the amount was coming  &amp; was being deposited in his 

account &amp; he was withdrawing that much amount or spending that amount 

against various heads. Therefore, this statement also can not be taken into 

consideration so as to assess the income of the deceased. Despite several 

opportunities by the court, no evidence has come on record. Therefore, the 

court is of the opinion that when the petitioners themselves are not ready to 

co­operate,the   court   has   to   decide   the   issue   on   the   basis   of 

evidence/documents only as to what would be the 'just compensation' for 

such  person.   No evidence with respect  to the fact  that the deceased  was 

having some agriculture land has come on record. No evidence has come on 

record   that   the   deceased   was   doing   the   business   of   supplying   building 

materials on the trucks of his brother. The father and the brother have not

appeared   in   witness   box   to   depose   about   the   nature   of   activity   of   the 

deceased and there is no evidence that the deceased was running school in 

Gurgaon. Even, no document showing the educational qualification of the 

deceased has been filed on record.  Therefore, the court is of the opinion that 

such   a   person   can   only   be   assessed   on   the   basis   of   minimum   wages   of 

unskilled labour.   The Minimum wages of a unskilled person in the month 

of January, 2006 is Rs. 3165.90/­ to be rounded of Rs.3166/­.   Since his 

income has been assessed on the <a href="/doc/142278/" id="a_3">Minimum Wages Act</a> which generally get 

doubled  within 10 years and as such it is clear that he is entitled for future 

benefits and   as per Vidyawati's case   the   future prospects comes to Rs. 

3166+ (50% of 3166)  ie. Rs.1583/­ and total of which comes to Rs.4749/­. 

Since the deceased was married, has his wife , children and parents ,   he 

would have been spending 1/3rd  of his salary on himself which comes to Rs 

1583/­ p.m   and the amount of deceased would have been saving towards 

dependency   allowance   would   come   to     Rs.3166/­   p.m   and   his   annual 

dependency   allowance   would   have   been   Rs.37,992/­   p.a   and   the   total 

dependency allowance would come to  Rs. 37,992/­X 17 =  6,45,864/­.



14            Apart from this, the petitioners have claimed that they have spent 

about Rs.1 lac on the treatment of the deceased but no document has been

filed on the record.     However, apart from the above mentioned   amount, 

petitioners are also entitled for certain non pecuniary damages, which are to 

be as follows:­

i.       towards loss of love and affection                  : Rs. 10,000/­

ii.      towards loss of consortium                          : Rs. 10,000/­

iii.     towards loss of estate                              : Rs. 10,000/­

iv.      towards funeral Charges                             : Rs. 10,000/­

               Accordingly,   it   is   held   that   the   petitioners   are   entitled   for 

      compensation of Rs.6,85,864/­.

<p id="p_13">15             Now coming to the next aspect as to from whom the petitioners 

are entitled for compensation.  It is argued by learned counsel for petitioners 

that the liability of the respondents is  joint and several.  It is admitted by all 

the respondents that the vehicle was duly insured with the respondent no. 2, 

therefore, the liability to pay the compensation is joint and several by all the 

respondents but liability of the respondent no.2 is primary, who is insurer.



16             Respondent   no.2   is   directed   to   pay   compensation   of  Rs. 

6,85,864/­to the petitioners with interest@8% per annum from the date of

for the period  which  is specifically excluded by the court and subject  to 

adjustment of the amount paid towards interim award and interest, if any. 

The   respondent   no.   2   is   further   directed   to   deposit   the   amount   of 

compensation after calculation of amount of compensation within a period 

of one month and one month would start from the date when the petitioners 

will furnish their account number either to the respondent no. 2 or to the 

court.
