<div class="doc_title">Om Prakash Arya &amp; Ors vs State Of Jharkhand &amp; Anr on 8 August, 2012</div><pre id="pre_1">           In the High Court of Jharkhand at Ranchi

                   Cr.M.P. No.313 of 2008

           Om Prakash Arya and others...............................Petitioners

                   VERSUS

           State of Jharkhand and another........ ..........Opposite Parties

           CORAM: HON'BLE MR.JUSTICE R.R.PRASAD

           For the Petitioners : Mr.S Thakur
           For the State       : A.P.P
           For the O.P.No.2 : Mr. Awnish Shankar

6/ 08.08.2012</pre><p id="p_1">.     Heard learned counsel appearing for the petitioners and learned counsel

           appearing for the State and also learned counsel appearing for the opposite

           party no.2.
</p>
<p id="p_2">                   This application has been filed for quashing of the entire criminal

           proceeding of C.P case no.1603 of 2007 including the order dated 7.2.2008

           whereby and whereunder cognizance of the offences punishable under Sections

</p><p id="p_3">           148. 323. 379, 427, 448, 504, 506<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_1"> of the Indian Penal Code</a> has been taken

           against the petitioners.
</p>
<p id="p_4">                   The aforesaid order taking cognizance is being sought to be quashed on

           the ground that there has been land dispute in between the parties, who though

           are related to each other but they, on account of the land dispute, are in

           litigating term. It was pointed out that the complainant had earlier lodged a case

           in which when cognizance was taken that order was challenged in this Court, in

           Cr.M.P.No.963 of 2002. This Court quashed the order taking cognizance, vide

           order dated 11.4.2007. That apart,          the petitioners had also lodged a case

           against some of the relatives of the complainant which ended in conviction of

           that persons and now this case has been filed wherein all false allegations have

           been levelled against the entire family members and therefore, the prosecution

           being mala fide is fit to be quashed.
</p>
<p id="p_5">                          As against this, learned counsel appearing for the opposite party

           no.2 submits that this case has nothing to do with the case earlier lodged by the

           complainant      or by the petitioners, rather the case was lodged when the

           petitioners committed offence under which cognizance has been taken against

           them.
</p><p id="p_6">                    In this respect, learned counsel appearing for the opposite party

      no.2 submits that when daughter of the petitioner no.1 fell ill, it was suspected

      by the accused person that it was on account of witchcraft being played by the

      complainant she has become ill and therefore, they assaulted the complainant

      and other family members and as such, order taking cognizance never warrants

      to be quashed.
</p>
<p id="p_7">                   Even if there has been land dispute in between the parties and

      that earlier also a case had been lodged but that cannot be a ground for

      quashing of order taking cognizance when the allegations made do constitute

      offences under which cognizance has been taken.
</p>
<p id="p_8">                   In this situation, the order taking cognizance never warrants tobe

      quashed. Accordingly, this application stands dismissed.



</p><p id="p_9">                                                              ( R.R.Prasad, J.)
