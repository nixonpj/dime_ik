<p id="p_1">     Plaintiff Bank has filed this suit, praying the court to

pass the preliminary decree against the defendant and to

direct the defendant to pay the loan balance to the plaintiff

bank with interest @ 19.5% per annum from the date of suit

till the date of realization.
</p>
<p id="p_2">

</p><p id="p_3">  2. Pleadings in brief:
</p>
<p id="p_4">

     It is pleaded that defendant is a company represented by

its Chairman - cum - Managing Director. On 7/7/1992 the

defendant had applied for cash credit facility to the tune of
                                3              OS 8281/2001

Rs.50,00,000/- and he had executed On Demand Promissory

Note and undertaking to pay interest @ 22.75% per annum

with quarterly rests. At the time of availing the loan, defendant

had executed Lease-cum- Hypothecation Agreement. In the

course of transactions defendant had availed the cash credit

facility and he has not repaid those amounts promptly, as

such, he became due of Rs.26,93,692/- to the plaintiff bank

as on 3/10/1995. Even thereafter, defendant has not properly

repaid the loan amount, as such, he became due of

Rs.19,91,041/- as on 1/4/1996.        However, defendant had

acknowledged the outstanding debt on 3/10/1995 and on

1/4/1996 respectively by executing confirmation letters.

</p><p id="p_5">     After execution of confirmation letters, plaintiff bank has

allowed the defendant to continue to avail the cash credit

facility to the tune of Rs.50,00,000/-. At that time, defendant

has undertaken to pay interest @ 22.25% per annum with

quarterly rests on the outstanding loan amount and he has

availed cash credit facility to the tune of Rs.14,50,000/- upto

12/11/1998.     On that day, the defendant had executed

confirmation letter and acknowledged the outstanding loan of
                                 4             OS 8281/2001

Rs.14,50,000/- and he has agreed to repay that loan amount

with interest @ 19.38% per annum with quarterly rests. The

defendant had availed the cash credit facility for the purpose

of working capital to run the business.

</p><p id="p_6">     Thereafter, defendant did not repaid the loan amount, as

per the agreement. As such, plaintiff bank got issued a legal

notice to the defendant on 20/9/1999, calling upon him to

pay the outstanding loan balance of Rs.5,71,708/-. Inspite of

receipt of legal notice, defendant did not paid the loan balance

to the plaintiff bank. Hence this suit.



</p><p id="p_7">3.   In pursuance of suit summons, the defendant has not

appeared before the court, as such, defendant has been placed

exparte.
</p>
<p id="p_8">

</p><p id="p_9">4.   Thereafter, defendant has filed an application under

Order 9 Rule 7 of CPC, to set aside the exparte order passed

against the defendant and that I.A has been allowed. Exparte

order passed against the defendant has been set aside and

permitted the defendant to participate in the proceedings.
</p><p id="p_10">                                 5             OS 8281/2001

</p><p id="p_11">5.   It is regret and surprise to note that the defendant has

not chosen to contest the matter and even not filed the written

statement.
</p>
<p id="p_12">

</p><p id="p_13">6.   Subsequently, the Chief Manager of the Plaintiff Bank i.e.

<a href="/doc/201346/" id="a_1">Sri.N.I.Varghese S/o V.N.Itteer</a> has been examined in chief

partly and not turned up before the court, may be due to

transfer. Thereafter, the present Chief Manager of the plaintiff

bank i.e Sri. Uday Kumar Shetty S/o Sri.Muddanna Setty, has

been examined as PW.2 and at his instance 24 documents are

got marked and closed plaintiff side evidence.



</p><p id="p_14">7.   Arguments heard.
</p>
<p id="p_15">


</p><p id="p_16">8.   Points arisen for consideration of the court are:

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_8">                                 REASONS

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_9">10. POINTS No.1 &amp; 2:             These two points are taken together

since these two points are intrinsically interrelated to each

other.</blockquote><p id="p_18">

</p><p id="p_19">     Perused averments made in the plaint, oral evidence of

PWs.1 and 2 and supporting documents i.e. Exs.P.1 to P.24.

Wherein, it is observed that on 7/7/1992 defendant has

approached the plaintiff bank and requested the bank to
                                  7               OS 8281/2001

extend the cash credit facility to the defendant to the tune of

Rs.50,00,000/- for the purpose of working capital to run the

business and agreed to pay interest @ 22.75% per annum. In

that   connection,   defendant       had   executed   On   Demand

Promissory Note. At the same time, defendant had executed

an Hypothecation Agreement, as a security to the loan amount

and availed the facility. As on 3/10/1995 defendant was in

due of Rs.26,93,642/-.      In that regard, defendant had

executed the confirmation letter and acknowledged the debt.

As on 1/4/1996 defendant was in due of Rs.19,91,041/- to

the plaintiff bank. In that connection, defendant had executed

a confirmation letter and acknowledged the outstanding loan

balance.
</p>
<p id="p_20">       On 12/11/1998 defendant had executed fresh On

Demand Promissory Note for Rs.14,50,000/- and requested

the plaintiff bank to allow the defendant to avail the cash

credit loan facility to the tune of Rs.50,00,000/-. Considering

the request of defendant, plaintiff bank has extended the cash

credit facility to the defendant to the tune of Rs.50,00,000/-.

At the time of executing On Demand Pronote, defendant had
                                  8              OS 8281/2001

plaintiff bank and he became due of Rs.5,71,708/- as on

legal notice to the defendant on 20/9/1999, calling upon him

to pay the outstanding loan amount. Inspite of receipt of legal

notice, the defendant has not cleared the outstanding loan

amount.
</p>
<p id="p_22">      It appears, the defendant has no grievance against claim

of plaintiff bank, otherwise defendant could have been

contested the case to disprove the case of plaintiff bank. In

the absence of any sort of resistance from the defendant, this

court find any legal impediment to come to a conclusion that

plaintiff bank to the tune of Rs.50,00,000/- and availed the

facility.   At the time of availing the cash credit loan facility,

then acknowledged the outstanding debts on 3/10/1995 and

respectively. Thereafter, defendant had requested the plaintiff
