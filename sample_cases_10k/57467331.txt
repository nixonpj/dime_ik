                                                           ... Petitioner


                 The impugned order dated 18.6.2018 passed by learned

             Metropolitan Magistrate, 14th Court, Calcutta in complaint case

             No.1284 of 2005 closing the evidence of revisionist accused after

             rejecting his prayer for adjournment is a subject of challenge in

             this case.
</p>
<p id="p_4">                 The complaint case was instituted under <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_2">NI Act</a> in the year

             2005 for a cheque dated 30.9.2004 involving an amount of

             Rs.5,04,697/- having been dishonoured by Bank for insufficient of

             fund. The cheque was issued by the revisionist accused in favour

             of the complainant in connection with a business transaction held

             between the parties.
</p>
<p id="p_5">                 It appears that after the evidence of complainant was closed,

             the date for adducing evidence by defence was fixed. On 18th June,

             2018, defence adduced witness and it was examined for and on

             behalf of the revisionist-accused, and the next date was fixed on
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                            2</span>


25th July, 2018 for further defence witness. The day when it was

fixed for rest of the witnesses to be adduced by the defence, for the

reasons best known to the defence/revisionist, a prayer for

adjournment was taken out on the ground of illness of revisionist-

accused, which was rejected by the learned trial judge closing the

evidence of the revisionist-accused. This is all about the version of

the revisionist-accused.
</p>
<p id="p_6">    The revisional application was filed on 25th September, 2018.

Several dates got elapsed in the mean time. The revisionist did not

find himself convenient to appear on 8th March, 2019. In a

situation like this, the Court is not inclined to keep this revisional

application pending any more keeping in view of the long pendency

of the case.
</p>
<p id="p_7">    When the evidence of the revisionist was closed after rejecting

his prayer for adjournment, an opportunity, however, may be

extended to revisionist-accused to make out his defence by

adducing evidence on the date to be fixed by the learned trial court

without granting any further adjournment. Since a very small

point is involved in this case, and since the same can be decided

without securing the presence of the other side, the revisional

application may thus be disposed of on merits by recording the

following direction, and such direction is necessary to subserve the

purpose of justice.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                              3</span><p id="p_8">


    The impugned order dated 18.6.2018 passed by the learned

Metropolitan Magistrate, 14th Court, Calcutta in case no.1284 of

2005 rejecting the prayer for adjournment and thereby closing the

evidence of defence is set aside.
</p>
<p id="p_9">    Learned Magistrate is directed to fix a date subject to his

convenient preferably within one month from the date of

communication of this order extending an opportunity to adduce

the witness, if any sought to be examined by defence, without

granting any adjournment, giving sufficient opportunities to

prosecution.
</p>
<p id="p_10">    This   Court   makes         it   clear   that   after   extending   such

opportunity for once in order to enable the revisionist to adduce

evidence, if any, the learned Magistrate will be at his liberty to

dispose of the case in accordance with the law.

    With this observation/direction, the revisional application

stands disposed of.
</p>
<p id="p_11">    Urgent certified photostat copy of this order, if applied for, be

given to the parties as expeditiously as possible on compliance of

all necessary formalities.
