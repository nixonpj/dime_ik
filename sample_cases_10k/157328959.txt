                           1

13.5.2015.
      Shri S.K.Tiwari, Advocate for the applicant.
      Shri A.S.Yadav, Panel Lawyer for the respondent/State.</pre>
<p id="p_1">      Heard.
</p><p id="p_2">      Perused the case diary.
</p><p id="p_3">      This is second bail application under <a href="/doc/1290514/" id="a_1">section 439</a> of Cr.P.C.
The first application (M.Cr.C.No.12285/2014) has been dismissed
on merits vide order dated 29.1.15.
</p><p id="p_4">      The applicant has been arrested in connection with Crime
No.122/2014 registered at Police Station, Ajak (Civil Line), District
Datia, for the offence punishable under <a href="/doc/1128948/" id="a_2">Sections 120</a>, <a href="/doc/619940/" id="a_3">363</a>, <a href="/doc/796352/" id="a_4">366</a>,
<a href="/doc/1279834/" id="a_5">376(Gha)</a> of IPC, <a href="/doc/42436223/" id="a_6">Section 3(2)(v)</a> of the Scheduled Castes and
<a href="/doc/25085007/" id="a_7">Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act</a> and <a href="/doc/230360/" id="a_8">Section 4</a> of the
Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012.
</p><p id="p_5">      As per prosecution case, the complainant has lodged a report
that her minor daughter left the house saying that she is going to
Peetambara Peeth for Darshan, but when she did not return, search
was made, but she could not be traced. Suspicion was expressed
that somebody by persuading took away her. On this report, offence
was   registered   and    investigation   was   conducted.    During
investigation, the prosecutrix was recovered and her statement was
recorded. She disclosed that applicant and co-accused Sonu Pal by
pointing Katta forcibly took away her on motorcycle and both of
them committed rape with her.
</p><p id="p_6">      Learned counsel for the applicant submits that applicant has
        M.Cr.C.No.4398/2015 (Arvind Ahirwar Vs. State of M.P.)
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                  2</span>

       not committed any offence. He has been falsely implicated in the
       case. The prosecutrix in her statement recorded under <a href="/doc/447673/" id="a_9">Section 161</a>
       of Cr.P.C. did not even take the name of the applicant. Earlier at the
       time of rejection of first bail application as the charge-sheet was not
       filed, copy of the statement of the prosecutrix was not available with
       the applicant, and hence, this ground was not taken at that time. It
       is further submitted that applicant is in custody since 29.11.14 and
       trial is likely to take time. In such premises, applicant prayed for
       bail.
</p><p id="p_7">               The prayer is opposed by learned Panel Lawyer submitting
       that younger sister of the prosecutrix, namely Deepa Ahirwar has
       clearly stated in her statement under <a href="/doc/447673/" id="a_10">Section 161</a> of Cr.P.C. that
       applicant alongwith Sonu Pal came at Peetambara Peeth and took
       away the prosecutrix. It is further submitted that prosecutrix also in
       her statement recorded under <a href="/doc/497457/" id="a_11">Section 164</a> of Cr.P.C. has stated
       that applicant and Sonu forcibly took away her to Jhansi and
       committed rape with her. Hence, prayed for rejection of the bail
       application.
</p><p id="p_8">               Considering the overall facts and circumstances of the case,
       at this stage no new ground is made out to allow this second bail
       application. Hence, this application is hereby dismissed.
