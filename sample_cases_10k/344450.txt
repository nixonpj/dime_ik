                         Dated 8th November, 2006



                                    JUDGMENT
</pre>




<p id="p_1">Krishnan,J
              .
</p>



<p id="p_2">             This   is   an   appeal   preferred   against   the   order   of



the   Family   Court,   Malappuram   in   O.P.(Guardian)No.24   of   2006.
</p>


<p id="p_3">Father   of   a   4   year   old   child   had   filed   an   application   for



custody   of   the   child.     Mother   of   the   child   died   due   to



ailment   and   thereafter   the   child   is   with   the   grandparents,



i.e.,  parents of the  mother and  according  to the respondent,



he   is   not   given   any   opportunity   to   see   his   daughter   and,



therefore,   he   has   moved   the   application     for   custody   of   the



child.     The   appellants   had   filed   a   counter   stating   that   the



child   is   safe   in   their   hands   and   the   child   may   decide   to



reside with the father when she comes up of the age.   Family



court   after   analyzing   evidence   of   the   witnesses   available



held   that   the   child   is   to   be   handed   over   to   the   father   and,



therefore, the direction was given.   It also made clear that



the   grandparents   have   the   right   to   visit   the   child   as   and



when   they   desire   and   that   the   petitioner   shall   produce   the



child before them twice in every year on his visit to native



place.  Learned counsel for the appellants would contend that



when custody of the child is handed over to the father, there



is   danger   for   the   following   reasons   namely   that   he   had


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">MFA(G&amp;W).201/2006                      2</span>


remarried   and   the   attitude   of   the   step-mother   towards   the



child   is   unknown   and   further   she   had   been   brought   up   by



them   and   she   may   not   get   the   same   type   of   care   and



affection which she gets from them.   The Family Court found



that the father had remarried and a child is born to him in



that   wife   as   well   and   further   the   second   wife   was   also



examined   before   the   court   and   it   was   found   by   the   court



that   she   is   prepared   to   look   after   the   child   in   the   same



way  she will look after her own child.  Further, it has to



be   held   that   the   father   is   the   natural   guardian   and   the



death of the mother of the child was not on account of any



cruelty  or  illtreatment  by  the  father.        The  Family  Court



analyzed   the   evidence   in   the   correct   perspective   from   both



factual  matrix   as   well   as   legal   points   and   a   direction   was



given   to   hand   over   the   child   to   the   father   and   we   do   not



find   any   ground   to   interfere   in   the   said   decision.     The



Family   Court   has   also   given   a   direction   to   produce   the



child   before   the   grandparents   twice   in   an   year   when   the



respondent   comes   to   his   native   place   with   the   child.     The



visitorial   right   to   the   grandparents   is   also   protected.
</p>


<p id="p_4">Therefore,   the   Family   Court   has   considered   the   anxiety   of



the   grandparents   as   well   in   dealing   the   case   and,



therefore, we do not find any merit in the appeal.  But, we



make it clear that when there is any change of circumstance


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">MFA(G&amp;W).201/2006                   3</span>


or   hardship   or   harassment   is   caused   to   the   child,   the



grandparents   are   at   liberty   to   move   an   application   before



the   court   explaining   the   change   of   circumstance   and   Family



Court  shall  consider  the  same  at  that  point  of  time.   With



that observation the appeal is dismissed.
