  Maharashtra Land Revenue Code, 1966 (hereinafter referred to as

  "the   MLR   Code"  for   short]   and   the  Maharashtra   Land   Revenue

  (Extraction   and   Removal   of   Minor   Minerals)   Rules,   1968,

  hereinafter referred to as  "the Rules" framed thereunder, arise for

  consideration. Other set of Rules with which we are concerned are

  the  Maharashtra   Minor   Mineral     Extraction   (Development   and

  Regulation) Amendment Rules, 2013   as amended in 2017. These

  Rules are referred to as "the 2017 Rules" in this judgment.

  have   advanced   arguments   on   behalf   of   petitioners   and   Shri   N.R.

  Patil, learned A.G.P. on behalf of   respondents has opposed   their

  contentions.     With their consent, and considering the controversy

  placed   for   consideration,   matters   are   taken   up   for   final   disposal.

  Hence,   we   issue  Rule  in   all   these   petitions   and   make   the   same

  to respective petitioners is claimed to be caught while carrying sand

  illegally.   Sand therefore, is seized and penalty   therefor has been

  levied under Section 48(7).     Similarly, for use of truck, the truck

  also has been seized and penalty as prescribed under the Rules has

  been   charged   or   is   being   charged   under   Section   48(8).       Basic

  contention therefore, was this constituted double jeopardy.

  and  equal amount as penalty; market value of sand and amount of

  Rs. 2 lakh for illegal use of transport vehicle under Section   48(8)

</p><p id="p_8">  5.                Facts in Writ Petition No. 3105/2018 have been used

  and   pressed into service by all to support legal submissions.  In this

  petition, the order impugned is dated 24.05.2018, and it is passed

  by   respondent   Sub   Divisional   Officer.     Its'   perusal   shows   that   on

  19.05.2018,   Tipper   bearing   No.   MH-40/AK-5691   was   used   for

  transporting     sand   illegally.     It   was   caught   at   Mouza   Taregaon

  Khurd, and a seizure memo/ japti nama was prepared.  At that time,

  statement   of   driver   -   Gajanan   Gawade,   was   recorded.     The   said

  driver   accepted   that   he   was   not   having   transport   permit   for

  transporting sand, and it was being carried in said truck illegally.

  Sand was then measured and was found to be 4.46 brass.   Hence,

  action under Section 48[7] of the MLR Code and Rules as amended

  on 12.01.2018, has been taken.  The relevant Rule is Rule 9(1)(2).

  Respondent   Sub   Divisional   Officer   found   that   illegal   transport   of

  sand     established   and   therefore,   he   has   charged   an   amount   of

  Rs.35,680/-   towards   illegal   excavating   of   sand;   an   amount   of

  Rs.1784/- towards Royalty.  Thus, total amount of Rs. 37,464/- has

  been   levied.     Thereafter,   action   under   amended   Rule   9[1][2]

  (supra),   has   been   taken,   and   petitioner   has   been   asked   to   pay

  penalty  of   Rs.  2  lakhs.    The  impugned  order  mentions that  after

  these amounts are   deposited, separate orders   shall be passed for

  releasing the vehicle.

<p id="p_9">
</p><p id="p_10">  6.                Petitioners   submit   that   illegal   excavation   of   sand   has

  not been established at all.  Material on record does not show that

  the sand came from sand ghat or other place not assigned by the

  State Government, and it has not been established that the said sand

  was  therefore, vesting in State Government.  Hence, Section 48[7]

  of the MLR Code itself is not applicable.  It is contended that Section

  48[7], is not at all attracted in case of persons like petitioners, who

  are only operating as transporters and in no way  excavate the sand.


</p><p id="p_11">  7.                It   is   further   contended   that   as   Section   48[7]   is   not

  applicable, Section 48[8]  is also not attracted, hence, the impugned

  order asking petitioners to pay penalty under Section 48[7] as also

  Section 48[8], is bad.

  virtue of Section 48[1] of the MLR Code, vests in State Government,

  hence, finding any sand or minor mineral at a place without legal

  of the Maharashtra Ordinance  No.XII of 2015, by which provisions

  of   Sections   48[7]   and   48[8]   have   been   suitably   amended.  Our

  attention is also drawn to said Sections  to point out that there after

  in Sub-rule, clause [19], consequential amendment is also carried

  out.   They submit that petitioners have been rightly asked to pay 5

  times the market value, as penalty, Rs. 2 lakhs towards vehicle and

  single amount of royalty.  They submit that none of the petitioners

  challenge constitutional validity and even did/do not object to levy

  of single royalty.  They   argue that Sections 48[7] and 48[8], form

  Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/1769219/" id="a_1">State (NCT of Delhi) v. Navjot Sandhu</a>, (2005)

  11   SCC   600,  at  page   760  in   para  255  mentions  that  the   crucial

  requirement of either <a href="/doc/655638/" id="a_2">Article 20</a> of the Constitution or <a href="/doc/87754/" id="a_3">Section 26</a> of

  the General Clauses Act is that the offences are the same or identical

  in all respects. It relies upon its earlier view in  <a href="/doc/1871696/" id="a_4">State of Bihar v.

   Murad Ali Khan</a> : (1988) 4 SCC 655 at p. 668, (paras 30-31) where

  Hon'ble  Court has observed that "Though <a href="/doc/87754/" id="a_5">Section 26</a> in its opening

  words refers to "the act or omission constituting an offence under

  two or more enactments", the emphasis is not on the facts alleged in

  the two complaints but, rather on the ingredients which constitute

  the  two offences with which a person  is Even  if charged. This is

  made clear by the concluding portion of the section which refers to

  "shall not be liable to be punished twice for the same offence". If the

  offences are not the same but are distinct, the ban imposed by this

  provision also cannot be invoked.'   When the object of <a href="/doc/905940/" id="a_6">Section 48</a>

  and adverse impact of its violation on environment and   public at

  large   is   kept   in   mind,   the   powers   given   to   the   executive   by   the

  legislature are not arbitrary at all. Even presuming that any other

  view is possible or if there be any scope for doubt, these provisions

  call   for   an   interpretation   in   favour   of   the   Administration   and

  advantage thereof can not  be conferred on the wrongdoers.

</p><p id="p_36">  21.               It is important to mention here that   petitioners have

  not even attempted to explain the relevance of principles of double

  jeopardy in present matters.  None of the petitioners  claim to have

  any  lease of sand ghat from state Government.  They were also not

  having transport permit and still their vehicles were carrying sand.

  In view of <a href="/doc/905940/" id="a_7">Section 48</a>[1] of the MLR Code, that sand vests with the

  State Government.  If petitioners wish to claim any interest in said

  sand,   they   have   to  establish   their   legal     title   to   its   ownership   or

  possession.   If they are possessing a licence to operate sand ghat,

  and sand is extracted from it, and is being transported as per law,

  burden   is   upon     them   to   demonstrate   necessary   facts     for   this

  purpose.     When petitioners before  us are not claiming  any  such

  lease   of   sand   ghat   and   argue   that   they   are   plain   transporters,

  necessary   documents   to   support   that   role   also   needed   to   be

  produced by them.  Such documents may show a contract with the

  specific sand ghat lease holder to transport that sand to a particular

  destination or then it may be a contract with the purchaser of sand

  to deliver it to him at a particular address.   Necessary receipts and

  transport permit could have demonstrated this.   Petitioners do not

  possess any such documents.   They remain satisfied by contending

  that respondents have not shown custody of sand with petitioners in

  respective trucks, to be illegal.

  Minor   Mineral     Extraction   (Development   and   Regulation)

  Amendment Rules, 2017. This amendment amends the parent rules

  i.e. the Maharashtra Minor Mineral   Extraction (Development and

  Regulation)  Rules, 2013 which are framed under <a href="/doc/671947/" id="a_8">Section 15</a> of the

  Mines &amp; Minerals (Development and <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_9">Regulation) Act</a>, 1957. 2017

  Rules amend Rule 66(14) and   substitutes Rule 78 of   the parent

  2013 Rules. As per Rule 66(14), the vehicle transporting the sand

  must   carry   the   transit   pass.   It   is   prepared   in   duplicate   and     the

  original goes to the purchaser of sand. This sub-rule declares that in

  absence of the transit pass, the minor mineral carried in the vehicle

  is  treated  as  "illicit  and    unlawful",     to  be  dealt   with  as  per   the

  prevailing provisions of the applicable law.  Rule 78 substituted by

  of the 2017 amendment, is on same lines.   Thus, absence of transit

  pass or transport permit renders the sand in respective vehicle of the

  petitioners illicit and   unauthorized.   It therefore, attracts <a href="/doc/1285531/" id="a_10">Section

  48(7)</a> as also Section 48(8) of the MLR Code.   This entire scheme in

  they are putting cart before the horse.  Sand  found with them is not

  for their personal use. They claim it and   attempt to justify their

  possession  contending that they were  transporting it. Thus, when

  they claim sand to be for their business purposes,   burden is upon

  them to explain its source and prove their right to possess it.     In

  absence of this, presumption that they are holding sand illegally  i.e.

  contrary to Section 48 of Code follows.  The provisions in Rules also

  mandate possession of transport permit with the person carrying the

  sand     and   drawing   of   adverse   inference,   if   it   be   not   there.

  Petitioners therefore, have failed to   discharge their burden.   Not

  only this, they have also not approached   either the Authorities or

  this Court with clean hands and are trying to take  roving pleas and

  of   rights   of   extraction,   the   transporter   cannot   be   booked   for

  of sand by assignee himself was unauthorised and illegal.  It is held

  seize   and     confiscate   the   vehicle   carrying   Mineral   in   excess     of

  weight permitted to be carried in it.   These observations appear to

  be in relation to "carrying capacity" of that vehicle in terms of Motor

  Vehicle Legislation.   The sand ghat owner in said matter was not

  given     any   show   cause   notice.       Facts   do   not   show   that   the

  transporter in case of Neha Anil Agre .vrs. State of Maharashtra and

  others (supra), was not having transport permit for transporting the

  sand and because of transport permit with him, the sand ghat owner

  could   have   been   traced   out.     This   judgment,   therefore,   considers

  case where  a petitioner  can establish himself to be only a bonafide

  transporter.   This is not the position in   present matters.   None of

  the   petitioners   before   us   have   established   their   status   only   as

  transporters.

  due to <a href="/doc/1285531/" id="a_16">Section 48</a>[1] of the MLR Code, its excavation in violation of

  <a href="/doc/1285531/" id="a_17">Section 48</a>[7], stands established.  Under <a href="/doc/1285531/" id="a_18">Section 48</a>[7],  words with

  wide import are employed.     Thus, even picking up or removal of

  sand   by   an   unauthorized   person   is   prohibited.     Words   "Extracts,

  Removes, Collects, Replaces, Picks-up or Dispose of" cannot be seen

  as   synonymous.     Operation   like   "Replacement"   or   "Removal"   or

  "Dispose of" or "Picking up"  take within its fold even transporting.

  Under <a href="/doc/1285531/" id="a_19">Section 48</a>[8], power is given to the Government to seize and

  confiscate   the   machinery   and   equipments   used   for   unauthorized

  operations  prohibited under <a href="/doc/1285531/" id="a_20">Section 48</a>[7].  Clause 2 of sub-section

  [8], expressly permits seized vehicle to be dealt with in a manner

  prescribed therein.  When a vehicle like truck is loaded with stolen

  sand and the sand is being carried away, action against the person

  who is transporting it for   excavation and/or for transportation is

  definitely envisaged under <a href="/doc/1285531/" id="a_21">Section 48</a>[7] read with <a href="/doc/1285531/" id="a_22">Section 48</a>[8] of

  the MLR Code.  Petitioners cannot contend that though illegal sand

  was found in their trucks, no action can be taken against the said

  truck.     Learned A.G.P. is right in submitting that the trucks have

  been   used   to   accomplish   the   clandestine   operation   prohibited   by

  <a href="/doc/1285531/" id="a_23">Section   48</a>[7].     The   truck,   therefore,   becomes   a   property   in   the

  prohibited operation and hence, separate action against it cannot be

  said to  constitute double jeopardy.
