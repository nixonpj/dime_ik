<p id="p_2">1.                Vide this order, I shall dispose of an application filed by the

     petitioner under Order 6 Rule 17 CPC read with Section 151 CPC.



</p><p id="p_3">2.                  It   has   been   submitted   by   the   petitioner   in   the   present

     application that the present petition has been filed by the petitioner  for

     eviction of the respondent from the tenanted property bearing municipal

     number 1646 as correctly stated in para no.1, 2 and 8 of the petition and

     has been correctly shown in the site plan.  The petitioner has submitted

     that however the municipal number of the premises was wrongly typed

     as   1647   instead   of   1646   in   the   third   line   of   the   prayer   clause.     The

     petitioner   has   further   submitted   that   the   said   mistake   came   into   the


E. No. 99/2010                                                                         Page no.1  of  5
    notice when the same was pointed out by the respondent in his leave to

   defend application.   The petitioner further submitted that the aforesaid

   error is not intentional or motivated and is the result of the typographical

   mistake.   The petitioner has prayed that he be allowed to amend his

   petition with respect to the correct number of the tenanted shop as 1646

   instead of 1647 in the third line of the prayer clause of the petition and

   the said amendment is necessary for the proper adjudication of the case

   and for the ends of justice.

<p id="p_4">

</p><p id="p_5">3.            The reply to the present application was filed by the respondent

   submitting therein that the present application is not maintainable and

   only motive of the petitioner is to harass the respondent by filing false

   and  vexatious  litigation.     The   respondent   further   submitted   that   the

   petitioner earlier also had filed a petition for eviction of the respondent

   on   similar   grounds   of   alleged   bonafide   requirements   in   which   the

   respondent   also   filed   his   leave   to   defend   application   but   when   the

   petitioners realised that they would not be able to succeed in the said

   petition,   have   chosen   to   withdraw   the   said   petition   by   submitting

   technical   objections   and   vide   order   dated   02/07/2010   the   petitioners

   were permitted  to withdraw  the said eviction petition and  the  present


E. No. 99/2010                                                              Page no.2  of  5
      petition and the application are another attempt of the petitioners to get

     the   respondent   embroiled   in   litigation.     The   respondent   has   further

     submitted that the site plan does not depict the shop number in respect

     of which the eviction petition has been filed which gives rise to a triable

     issue   regarding   identification   of   the   property.     The   respondent   has

     further submitted that as the respondents have taken the ground with

     regard to the number of premises in the leave   to defend application

     making it a triable issue for granting of leave to contest, therefore the

     petitioners cannot be permitted to prejudice the rights of the respondent

     to the grant of leave on the said ground and the petitioners cannot be

     permitted to improve his petition by amending it and by defeating the

     valuable rights of the respondent.  The respondent has further submitted

     that   the   averment   of   the   petitioner   regarding   the   municipal   number

     mentioned   in   the   prayer   clause   due   to   typographical   mistake   is   an

     afterthought.   The respondent  has further  prayed for dismissal of the

     present application with heavy costs.

     for the parties.

</p><p id="p_10"> 5.               The   contention   of   Ld.   counsel   for   the   petitioner   is   that   the

   premises number has been wrongly typed as 1647 instead of 1646 in

   the prayer clause due to typographical error.   On the other hand, the

   contention of the Ld. counsel for the respondent is that the respondent

   has averred about the same in his leave to defend application by making

   it a triable issue and the petitioner cannot be permitted to improve its

   petition by amending it.

<p id="p_11">

</p><p id="p_12">6.               Under   Order   6   Rule   17   CPC   all   amendments   which   are

   necessary for the purpose of deciding the real controversy between the

   parties shall be allowed to be made.  On the perusal of the petition filed

   by   the   petitioner,   the   number   of   the   tenanted   premises   has   been

   mentioned correctly by the petitioner in the para no.1, 2 and 8 of the

   petition.  The present petition has been filed by the petitioner against the

   respondent in respect of one premises which is under the tenancy of the

   respondent.  The contention of the Ld. counsel for the respondent that

   as the respondent has averred about the said fact of different number

   being mentioned in the prayer clause and which raises a triable issue

   has no merits as the respondent in his leave to defend application has


E. No. 99/2010                                                                     Page no.4  of  5
    not denied that he is a tenant in respect of one shop bearing no.1646, S.

   P. Mukherjee Marg, Delhi­06.  Therefore, as the number of the premises

   has been mentioned by the petitioner correctly in the body of the petition

   and the respondent has also not denied that he is a tenant in one shop

   bearing   no.1646,   S.   P.   Mukherjee   Marg,   Delhi­06,   the   mentioning   of

   premises  number   as  1647  in  the   prayer   clause  appears  just  to be  a

   typographical   mistake.     Hence,   the   present   application   filed   by   the

   petitioner  under  Order  6 Rule 17 CPC is allowed.    Let the amended

   plaint be also filed by the petitioner.
