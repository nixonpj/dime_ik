      This Criminal Petition coming on for orders this day,

                            ORDER

<p id="p_1">       This petition is filed by the petitioners/accused

Nos.1 to 3 under <a href="/doc/1290514/" id="a_3">Section 439</a> of Cr.P.C. seeking their

release on bail for the offences punishable under

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                               3</span>



S.C.No.428/2013 on the file of City Civil and Sessions

Judge, (CCH 59) at Bengaluru.
</p>
<p id="p_2">

</p><p id="p_3">     2.    Heard the arguments of the learned counsel

appearing for the petitioners/accused Nos.1 to 3 and

also the learned Special Public Prosecutor representing

the respondent-State.
</p>
<p id="p_4">
</p><p id="p_5">     3.    Learned counsel for the petitioners during

the course of his arguments submitted that since five

years the petitioners are in custody. Out of 137 charge

sheet witnesses now 50 witnesses have been already

examined   including    the   alleged   eyewitnesses.   The

witnesses examined before the Court who are said to be

the eyewitnesses to the incident have turned hostile and

not supported the case of the prosecution. More than

70 witnesses are yet to be examined in the case, which

will take long time. When the material witnesses have
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                 4</span>



turned hostile and not supported the prosecution case,

there is no reason to keep the petitioners/accused

Nos.1 to 3 in custody. Hence, by imposing reasonable

conditions, petitioners may be admitted to regular bail.


</p><p id="p_6">      4.       Per-contra, learned Special Public Prosecutor

has submitted that in this case good number of

witnesses have given their statement during the course

of investigation and since it is a case of brutal murder,

the Hon'ble Division Bench of this Court is monitoring

the    trial      proceedings       in   the   case.      In

W.P.No.47342/2012, the Division Bench of this Court

by its order dated 11.10.2017 has given six months time

for completion of trial proceedings and the said period

will expire in the month of March 2018.            The other

important witnesses like Doctor, Investigation Officer,

the witnesses who gave their statement under <a href="/doc/497457/" id="a_13">Section

164</a> of Cr.P.C. and the witnesses who identified the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                             5</span>



accused persons in the test identification parade are yet

to be examined in the case.     Therefore, at this stage,

only on the basis that some of the witnesses have

turned hostile, the petitioners cannot be granted with

bail.    Hence, learned Special Public Prosecutor has

opposed the petition and submitted to reject the same.


</p><p id="p_7">        5.   I have perused the grounds urged in the bail

petition, FIR, complaint, entire charge sheet material

produced by the learned counsel for the petitioners

along with the petition.
</p>
<p id="p_8">

</p><p id="p_9">        6. No doubt, it is the contention of the learned

counsel for the petitioners that as per <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_14">Article 21</a> of the

Constitution regarding life and liberty, speedy trial of

the case is a fundamental right and the accused

persons have got every right to seek for speedy disposal

of the case. But looking to the magnitude of the case
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                             6</span>



and   the    number   of   witnesses   examined   during

investigation, this aspect has been already considered

by the Hon'ble Division Bench in writ proceedings and

time has been already granted to complete the trial

proceedings by its order dated 11.10.2017, which period

has not expired as of now. It may be the contention of

the learned counsel for the petitioners that petitioners

were not heard in the matter in the writ proceedings.

However, if there is any such grievance, it is for the

petitioners to move the concerned Hon'ble Division

Bench.      But when other important witnesses, as

submitted by the learned Special Public Prosecutor, are

yet to be examined before the Court, only on the basis of

the witnesses examined till now, the learned Sessions

Judge may not be in a position to take decision in the

matter.     The learned Sessions Judge can come to a

definite conclusion regarding the guilt or innocence of

the petitioners and other accused persons only after
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                              7</span>



conclusion of trial and after examining other important

material witnesses in the case.
</p>
<p id="p_10">

</p><p id="p_11">      7. In view of the above facts and as the Hon'ble

Divison Bench of this Court is monitoring the trial

proceedings, I am of the opinion that petitioners are not

entitled to be granted with bail.
</p>
<p id="p_12">

</p><p id="p_13">      Hence, petition is hereby rejected.
</p>
<p id="p_14">
