     THIS W.P IS FILED UNDER <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1">ARTICLE 226</a> <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_2">&amp; 227</a> OF

    THIS WRIT PETITION COMING ON FOR PRELIMINARY
HEARING 'B' GROUP THIS DAY, COURT MADE THE
FOLLOWING:

                         ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">     These writ petitions are filed challenging the notification

issued under Section 4(1) and <a href="/doc/466483/" id="a_3">Section 6(1)</a> of the Land
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                  3</span>



<a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_4">Acquisition Act</a>, acquiring the petitioner's land for setting up the

water treatment plant in the village Malachapur, Bhalki Taluk,

Bidar District.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">2.            The petitioner is the owner and in possession of the

land bearing Sy.No.132/A to the extent of 2 acres 10 guntas

situated at Malachapur, Bhalki Village, Bidar District.         He

purchased the same under a registered sale deed dated

21.08.2008.    His name appears in the mutation records.        He

purchased the property for non-agricultural potentiality and is

fit for developmental activity rather than agricultural activities.

The land is on Bidar-Humnabad State Highway on one side and

Khanapur Road on the other side.         The respondent issued

notification to acquire the said land for the purpose of

construction of water treatment plant. The petitioner was not

served with notice of the said acquisition. On the contrary, he

was served with notice under <a href="/doc/466483/" id="a_5">Section 6(1)</a> as well as <a href="/doc/1015358/" id="a_6">Section 9(1)</a>

of the Act. With this, he came to know about the acquisition

proceedings. He filed his objections contending that adjacent to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                4</span>



the land of the petitioner there is 10 acres of land belonging to

the Government, which can be utilized for the same purpose.

The said objection was filed by him on 17.05.2011.        Under

those circumstances he has preferred this writ petition

challenging the acquisition.
</p>
<p id="p_4">
</p><p id="p_5">3.          The respondents have entered appearance and filed

their detailed statement of objections.   They contend that an

extent of 10 acres of land is acquired for the purpose of

construction of drinking water treatment plant for supplying

drinking water to the entire Bidar City.      Sy.No.132 totally

measures 21 acres 18 guntas, standing in the name of different

persons. Only an extent of 10 acres was acquired out of the

said extent, which is geographically suitable for supplying

drinking water. They contend that after service of notice of the

acquisition under <a href="/doc/169774/" id="a_7">Section 4(1)</a>, the petitioner has filed his

objections, he was heard and on 06.08.2011 an endorsement

was also issued.    Therefore the contention that he was not

served with notice of acquisition under <a href="/doc/169774/" id="a_8">Section 4(1)</a> notification
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                 5</span>



and he was not heard, is not correct. The contention that land

in Sy.No.111 which belongs to the Government is situated near

by, is not correct. Sy.No.111 is situated about 3 kms away from

the main road and the situation of the said land is not feasible

and suitable for installing the water treatment plant. The main

grievance of the petitioner is that the market value of the land is

more than Rs.50 lakhs per acre and if that is the market value,

he would get the compensation accordingly. That cannot be a

ground for challenging the acquisition proceedings.


</p><p id="p_6">4.          I have heard the learned Counsel for the parties.


</p><p id="p_7">5.          From the aforesaid material on record it is clear

that the land is acquired for public purpose of providing

drinking water facility to Bidar District.    The petitioner has

purchased the said land for commercial venture as is clear from

the averments in the petition itself.   It is not the petitioner's

land alone, which is acquired. The total extent of land available

in Sy.No.132 is 21 acres 18 guntas belonging to different

persons. Out of the said extent, an area of 10 acres is acquired,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                    6</span>



which includes the land of the petitioner. The North Karnataka

Urban Sector Implementation Project and Karnataka Urban

Infrastructure Development Finance Corporation, the experts in

the field have opined that geographically the said land is

suitable for installing the water treatment plant. Sy.No.111, the

land which the Government owns, is situated about 3 kms away

from the main road and therefore it is not feasible for installing

the water treatment plant.        Therefore the contention of the

petitioner that the Government had alternative land is not

acceptable.      <a href="/doc/169774/" id="a_9">Section   4(1)</a>    notification     and    <a href="/doc/466483/" id="a_10">Section   6(1)</a>

notification are   issued.        The   grievance    is,   <a href="/doc/169774/" id="a_11">Section 4(1)</a>

notification is not served on him.         The State contends that

notice of <a href="/doc/169774/" id="a_12">Section 4(1)</a> notification was served, the petitioner filed

objections and endorsement is issued over-ruling the said

objections.
</p>
<p id="p_8">
</p><p id="p_9">6.            In the facts and circumstances of the case, even

otherwise, as the acquisition is for public purpose, no malafides

are attributed to the respondent. The petitioner has purchased
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                 7</span>



this property as a commercial venture. He is interested only in

the market value of the property. It is clear from his contention

that the property fetches Rs.50 lakhs per acre. If the property

fetches Rs.50 lakhs on the date of <a href="/doc/169774/" id="a_13">Section 4(1)</a> notification, he is

entitled for the same after the award is passed. It is open for

him to participate in the award proceedings and place the

material to show that the property fetches Rs.50 lakhs per acre

and wait for the award to be passed. If his claim is not fully

accepted, he has a right to seek reference. He can produce the

material before the Reference Court and seek for compensation.

Still he will have the right to agitate his right before this Court

and the Supreme Court. Under these circumstances, I do not

see any merit in these writ petitions.     Accordingly the writ

petitions are dismissed.
