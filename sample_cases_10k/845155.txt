ORAL
JUDGMENT</pre> 

 

<p id="p_1">[1.0]		By
way of this petition under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_1">Article 227</a> of the Constitution of India,
petitioner has prayed for an appropriate writ, direction or order
quashing and setting aside the impugned order dated 06.03.2009 passed
by the Labour Court, Amreli in (I.D.) Complaint No.3/2002 submitted
by the petitioner under <a href="/doc/1774629/" id="a_2">Section 33</a> of the Industrial Disputes Act,
1947 (hereinafter referred to as "<a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_3">ID Act</a>").
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_2">[2.0]		Shri
Mishra, learned advocate appearing on behalf of the petitioner has
submitted that as such the main Reference Demand No.7/2002 praying
for regularization etc. is pending before the Labour Court, Amreli
and therefore, learned Judge ought to have allowed the said complaint
under <a href="/doc/1774629/" id="a_4">Section 33</a> of the ID Act and ought to have restrained the
respondent from changing the service conditions.  It is submitted
that as such the petitioner is serving since last more than 15 to 20
years and it is apprehended that the services of the petitioner shall
be terminated by the respondent.  
</p>
 

 


 

<p id="p_3">[3.0]		
Having heard Shri Mishra, learned advocate appearing on behalf of the
petitioner and considering the impugned order, it appears that infact
earlier the order of status-quo granted by this court has been
vacated by this Court and thereafter the petitioner has raised an
industrial dispute which is numbered as Reference Demand No.7/2002
which is still reported to be pending for adjudication before the
Labour Court, Amreli.  It prima facie appears
that at the relevant time the petitioner was treated as an employee
of the Contractor, however, the aforesaid question is required to be
considered by the Labour Court in the pending Reference Demand
No.7/2002.  Whatever the outcome of the Reference Demand No.7/2002,
consequences shall follow.  In the facts and circumstances of the
case, no illegality has been committed by the Labour Court, Amreli by
passing the impugned order in <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_5">(Industrial Disputes Act</a>, 1947)
Complaint No.3/2002.  Hence, no case is made to interfere with the
impugned order passed by the Labour Court, Amreli in exercise of
powers under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_6">Article 227</a> of the Constitution of India.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_4">[4.0]		In
view of the above and for the reasons stated above, there is no
substance in the present petition which deserves to be dismissed and
is, accordingly, dismissed.
