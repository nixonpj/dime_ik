       1. Om Prakash Sharma

                                         Versus

       For the Petitioners : Mr. Sudhansu Kumar Dei, Advocate

05/27.07.2017</pre><p id="p_1"> Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that he has removed the
defects at serial No.9 (i) to (iii), as pointed out by the office.
</p><p id="p_2">                                Apprehending their arrest in connection with
Mohanpur P.S. Case No.187 of 2014 corresponding to G.R. No.1185 of 2014
instituted under <a href="/doc/839778/" id="a_1">Sections 380</a>/<a href="/doc/838469/" id="a_2">452</a>/<a href="/doc/1183069/" id="a_3">386</a> of the Indian Penal Code, the petitioners
have moved this Court for grant of privileges of anticipatory bail.
</p><p id="p_3">                             Heard learned counsel appearing for the petitioners
and learned Addl.P.P. appearing for the State.
</p><p id="p_4">                      Learned counsel appearing for the petitioners submitted that
the allegation against the petitioners is that the mother-in-law of the informant
gave a premises on lease and license basis to the accused persons including the
petitioners and the co-accused persons for establishing and running a mineral
water plant but with passage of time the attitude of accused persons has turned
dishonest and now they want to grab that property. It is further alleged that the
accused persons criminally trespassed in to the house of informant and on the
point of pistol threatened her to vacate the premises and also committed theft of
ornaments and cash. It is further submitted that there is a series of litigation
relating to differences in partnership business. Hence, this case has falsely been
instituted against the petitioners. It is further submitted that co-accused persons,
whose case stand in the same footing, have already been granted the privileges of
anticipatory bail by a coordinate Bench of this court vide order dated 03.05.2017 in
A.B.A. No.4414 of 2016. Hence, the petitioners may be given the privileges of
anticipatory bail.
</p><p id="p_5">                      Learned Addl.P.P appearing for the State opposes the prayer
for anticipatory bail of the petitioners but conceded that co-accused persons,
whose case stand in the same footing, have already been granted the privileges of
anticipatory bail by a coordinate Bench of this court.
</p><p id="p_6">                      Considering the submissions of learned counsels and the facts
and circumstances stated above, I am inclined to grant privileges of anticipatory
bail to the petitioners. Accordingly, the petitioners are directed to surrender in the
Court of learned Judicial Magistrate, 1st Class, Deoghar within four weeks from
today and in the event of their arrest or surrendering, they will be enlarged on
bail on furnishing bail bond of Rs.10,000/- (Ten thousand) each with two sureties
of the like amount each to the satisfaction of learned Judicial Magistrate, 1 st Class,
Deoghar in connection with Mohanpur P.S. Case No.187 of 2014 corresponding to
G.R. No.1185 of 2014 subject to the condition that they will not interfere with the
possession of the informant over the place of occurrence premises till the
disposal of the case and other conditions as laid down under <a href="/doc/1692057/" id="a_4">Section 438(2)</a> of the
Code of Criminal Procedure.
