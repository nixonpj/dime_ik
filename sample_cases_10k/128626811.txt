      to all executive actions of the State being settled and
      for the same reason its applicability at the threshold

      cannot thereafter cast off its personality and exercise
      unbridled power unfettered by the requirements of

principles applicable to private individuals whose
rights flow only from the terms of the contract
without anything more. The personality of the State,
requiring regulation of its conduct in all spheres by
requirement of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_5">Article 14</a>, does not undergo such a
radical change after the making of a contract merely
because some contractual rights accrue to the other
party in addition. It is not as if the requirement of
<a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_6">Article   14</a>     and     contractual          obligations       are   alien
concepts, which cannot co-exist. The Constitution
does      not     envisage         or     permit        unfairness       or
unreasonableness in State actions in any sphere of its
activity contrary to the professed ideals in the
Preamble. Therefore, total exclusion of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_7">Article 14 -
non-</a>arbitrariness which is basic to rule of law from
State actions in contractual field is not justified. This
is more so when the modern trend is also to examine
the unreasonableness of a term in such contracts
where the bargaining power is unequal so that these
are not negotiated contracts but standard form
contracts between unequals.
</p>

<p id="p_73">       Unlike     the    private        parties     the       State   while
exercising its powers and discharging its functions,
acts indubitably, as is expected of it, for public good
and in public interest. The impact of every State
action is also on public interest. It is really the nature
of its personality as State which is significant and
must characterize all its actions, in whatever field,
and    not      the   nature      of     function,      contractual      or
otherwise, which is decisive of the nature of scrutiny
permitted for examining the validity of its act. The
requirement of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_8">Article 14</a> being the duty to act fairly,
justly and reasonably, there is nothing which militates
against the concept of requiring the State always to

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                  (Downloaded on 28/06/2019 at 01:53:44 AM)</span>
                                  (12 of 52)




so act, even in contractual matters. This factor alone
is   sufficient      to     import         at    least     the      minimal
requirements of public law obligations and impress
with this character the contracts made by the State or
its instrumentality. It is a different matter that the
scope of judicial review in respect of disputes tailing
within the domain of contractual obligations may be
more limited and in doubtful cases the parties may be
relegated to adjudication of their rights by resort to
remedies      provided          for        adjudication        of    purely
contractual       disputes.         However,          to      the    extent
challenge is made on the ground of violation of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_9">Article
14</a> by alleging that the impugned act is arbitrary,
unfair or unreasonable, the fact that the dispute also
falls within the domain of contractual obligations
would not relieve the State of its obligation to comply
with the basic requirements of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_10">Article 14.</a> To this
extent,    the     obligation         is    of   a   public      character
invariably in every case irrespective of there being
any other right or obligation in addition thereto. An
additional contractual obligation cannot divest the
claimant of the guarantee under <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_11">Article 14</a> of non-
arbitrariness at the hands of the State in any of its
actions.
</p>


<p id="p_74">53. From the above, it is clear that when an
instrumentality of the State acts contrary to public
good and public interest, unfairly, unjustly                            and
unreasonably, in its contractual constitutional or
statutory obligations, it really acts contrary to The
constitutional        guarantee            found      in      <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_12">Article   14</a>
of the Constitution. Thus if we apply the above
principle of applicability of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_13">Article 14</a> to the facts of
this case, then we notice that the first respondent

      being an instrumentality of State and a monopoly
      body had to be approached by the appellants by
      compulsion to cover its export risk. The policy of
      insurance covering the risk of the appellants was
      issued by the first respondent after seeking all
      required information and after receiving huge sums of
      money as premium exceeding Rs. 16 lacs. On facts
      we have found that the terms of the policy does not
      give room to any ambiguity as to the risk covered by
      the first respondent. We are also of the considered
      opinion that the liability of the first respondent under
      the policy arose when the default of the exporter
      occurred          and        thereafter          when          Kazakhstan
      Government failed to fulfil its guarantee. There is no
      allegation        that    the     contracts        in    question        were
      obtained either by fraud or by misrepresentation. In
      such tactual situation, we are of the opinion, the facts
      of this case do not and should not inhibit the High
      Court, or this Court from granting the relief sought for
      by the petitioner."

powers by the State. The High Court examined the
entire issue on the touchstone of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_16">Article 14</a> of the
Constitution of India. It has been observed that the
fixation of price done by the Board has violated the
<a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_17">Article 14</a> of the Constitution of India. It is correctly
observed that though Clause 7(b) permits the Board
to fix the final price of the demised premises, it
cannot be said that where the Board arbitrarily or
irrationally fixes the final price of the site without any
basis, such fixation of the price could bind the lessee.
</blockquote><p id="p_76">In such circumstances, the Court will have the
jurisdiction to annul the decision, upon declaring the
same to be void and non-est. A bare perusal of
Clause 7(b) would show that it does not lay down any
fixed components of final price. Clause 7(b) also does
not speak about the power of the Board to revise or
alter the tentative price fixed at the time of allotment.
The High Court has correctly observed that Clause
7(b) does not contain any guidelines which would
ensure that the Board does not act arbitrarily in fixing
the final price of demised premises. Since the validity
of the aforesaid Clause was not challenged, the High
Court has rightly refrained from expressing any
opinion thereon.
</p>
<p id="p_77">19. Even though the Clause gives the Board an
undefined power to fix the final price, it would have to
be exercised in accordance with the principle of
rationality and reasonableness. The Board can and is
entitled to take into account the final cost of the
demised premises in the event of it incurring extra
expenditure after the allotment of the site. But in the
garb of exercising the power to fix the final price, it
can not be permitted to saddle the earlier allottees
with the liability of sharing the burden of expenditure
by   the   Board   in    developing          some         other   sites

      subsequent to the allotment of the site to the
      Respondents. The Respondents have placed on record
      sufficient material to show that acquisition and
      development of land in the industrial area has been in
      phases.     Some       areas       and       segments         are      fully
      developed and others are in different stages of
      development. Sites and plots have been allotted at
      different times and locations. Thus, it cannot be said
      that all the allottees form one class. Earlier allottees
      having sites in fully developed segments cannot be
      intermingled with the subsequent allottees in areas
      which may be wholly undeveloped. Such action is
      clearly violation of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_18">Article 14.</a> We are also of the
      opinion that the Board can not be permitted to
      exercise its powers of fixing the final price under
      Clause 7(b) at any indefinite time in the future after
      the allotment is made. This would render the word
      "as soon as" in Clause 7(b) wholly redundant. As
      noticed earlier, in the present case, the Board has
      sought to fix the final price after a gap of 13 years.
      Such a course is not permissible in view of the
      expression "as soon as" contained in Clause 7(b).
</p>
<p id="p_78">      20. In our opinion, the High Court correctly concluded
      that the fixation of final price by the Board is without
      authority   of    law.     It   violates       <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_19">Article       14</a>   of    the
      Constitution of India being arbitrary and unreasonable

      "20. We are of the view that each case is to be
      decided in the facts and circumstances of the case in
      the light of the scheme published/framed and the
      terms and conditions mentioned in the brochure
      and/or in the prescribed form of application in the
      matter         of    escalation/determination                    of   cost       of
      house/flat. However, cases where there is limit for
      fixing the escalation of cost, normally the price of
      house or flat cannot exceed the limits so fixed. The
      determination of cost of house/flat or escalation of
      cost cannot be arbitrary or erratic. The authority has
      to broadly satisfy by placing material on record to
      justify the escalation of cost of a house/flat. Whether
      the delay was caused by the allottee or the authority
      itself    is    also      a    factor       which      has        bearing        in
      determination           of     the      cost      of    house/flat.             The
      unforeseen cause or the reason beyond control of the
      authority in a given case may be another factor to be
      kept in view. We may also notice that in these cases
      the tentative cost of houses was fixed at Rs. 48,000/-
      but final cost was determined at Rs. 2,08,000/-. This
      increase        is    not     mere        escalation        but       it   is    a
      multiplication by almost four and half times, although
      escalation could not exceed 10% as is evident from
      the contents of the brochure read with prescribed form
      of application for allotment of house itself. Contentions
      of the KDA run contrary to the contents of its own
      brochure on which the respondents acted adjusting
      their financial affairs understanding that the cost of
      the houses would be fixed in terms of brochure and
      that too not exceeding 10% of the estimated cost
      fixed initially."

        Authority v. Ajai Pal Singh</a> [1989]1SCR743 , had to
        deal with a similar situation in connection with the
        Bareilly Development Authority which had undertaken
        construction of dwelling units for people belonging to
        different income groups styled as 'Lower Income
        Group',     'Middle    Income         Group',       'Higher     Income
        Group', and the 'Economically Weaker Sections'. The
        respondents      to    the     said     appeal        had     registered
        themselves for allotment of the flats in accordance
        with the terms and conditions contained in the
        brochure issued by the Authority. Subsequently, the
        respondents of that appeal, received notices from the
        Authority      intimating       the      revised       cost     of    the
        houses/flats and the monthly installment rates which
        were   almost      double       of     the     cost     and    rate    of
        installments initially stated in the General Information
        Table. But taking all facts and circumstances into
        consideration, this Court said that it cannot be held
        that   there     was      a     mis-statement            or    incorrect
        statement or any fraudulent concealment, in the
        brochure published by the Authority. It was also said
        that the respondents cannot be heard to say that the
        authority had arbitrarily and unreasonably changed
        the terms and conditions of the brochure to the
        prejudice of the respondents. In that connection, it
        was pointed out that the most of the respondents had
        accepted the changed and varied terms. Thereafter
        they were not justified in seeking any direction from
        the Court to allot such flats on the original terms and
        conditions. Recently, the same question has been

examined in the case of <a href="/doc/24270450/" id="a_21">Delhi Development Authority
v. Pushpendra Kumar Jain</a> : AIR1995SC1 . In respect
of hike in the price of the flats, it was said:
</blockquote>

<p id="p_81">"Mere identification or selection of the allottee does
not clothe the person selected with a legal right to
allotment at the price prevailing on the date of drawal
of lots. The scheme evolved by the appellant does not
say so either expressly or by necessary implication.
On the contrary, Clause (14) thereof says that "the
estimated prices mentioned in the brochure are
illustrative and are subject to revision/modification
depending upon the exigencies of lay out, cost of
construction etc."
</p>

<p id="p_82">Although, this Court has from time to time taking the
special facts and circumstances of the cases in
question has upheld the excess charged by the
development      authorities,        over     the      cost   initially
announced as estimated cost, but it should not be
understood that this           Court has          held that such
development authorities have absolute right to hike
the cost of flats, initially announced as approximate
or estimated cost for such flats. It is well known that
persons belonging to Middle and Lower Income
Groups, before registering themselves for such flats,
have to take their financial capacity into consideration
and in some cases it results into great hardship when
the development authorities announce an estimated
or approximate cost and deliver the same at twice or
thrice of the said amount. The final cost should be
proportionate to the approximate or estimated cost
mentioned in the offers or agreements. With the high
rate   of   inflation,    escalation         of    the     prices   of

construction materials and labour charges, if the
scheme is not ready within the time frame, then it is
not possible to deliver the flats or houses in question
at the cost so announced. It will be advisable that
before   offering    the     flats        to   the    public   such
development authorities should fix the estimated cost
of the flats taking into consideration the escalation of
the cost during the period the scheme is to be
completed. In the instant case, the estimated cost for
the LIG flat was given out at Rs. 45,000. But by the
impugned communication, the appellant informed the
respondents that the actual cost of the flat shall be
Rs. 1,16,000 i.e. the escalation is more than 100%.
The High Court was justified in saying that in such
circumstances, the Authority owed a duty to explain
and to satisfy the Court, the reasons for such high
escalation. We may add that this does not mean that
the High Court in such disputes, while exercising the
writ jurisdiction, has to examine every detail of the
construction with reference to the cost incurred. The
High Court has to be satisfied on the materials on
record that the authority has not acted in an arbitrary
or erratic manner.
</p>
<p id="p_83">10. So far the facts of the present case are
concerned, it is an admitted position that in the
proforma attached to the application for registration,
the appellant said that the price mentioned by them
was a probable and estimated cost, the definite price
shall be intimated at the time of the allotment.
Thereafter, the appellant had been informing the
respondents and others who had got themselves
registered, from time to time regarding the escalation
in the cost of the flat. On of the reasons for the rise of
the price for the LIG flat from Rs. 60,000 to Rs.
1,60,000 appears to be the increase in the area of the

      flat itself from 500 sq.ft. to 714.94 sq.ft. From 1982
      to 1984, possession of the flats could not be delivered
      because of the dispute pending in the Court which
      also contributed to the increase in the cost of the flat.
      Admittedly, the respondents came in possession of
      the   flats   in    the     year      1984.      In    the     facts   and
      circumstances of the case, we are satisfied that no
      interference was called for by the High Court."

      with emphasis that the price indicated in the letter of

itself postulates enhancement of the cost of the land
the authorities were justified in raising additional
demand. We do not find any force in the contentions
of the learned Counsel for the appellants since Clause
(9) enables the competent authority to ask for
additional    amount       only      when         there     has    been
enhancement in the cost of land on account of any
award   by    the     competent            authority       determining
compensation under the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_22">Land Acquisition Act</a>. Clause
(9) is extracted hereinbelow in extenso:
</blockquote>
<p id="p_86">"The above price is tentative to the extent that any
enhancement in the cost of land awarded by the
competent Authority under the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_23">Land Acquisition Act</a>
shall also be payable proportionately as determined by
the authority. The additional price determined shall be
paid within thirty days of its demand."
</p>
<p id="p_87">The aforesaid clause unequivocally indicates that if
there has been any enhancement in the cost of the
land on account of award by the competent authority
under   the    land     <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_24">Acquisition         Act</a>     then     the   said
enhancement would be payable proportionately as
determined by the authorities. The aforesaid clause
does not authorise the allotting authority to raise
additional demand on account of any other escalation.
It is well settled that the competent authority is
entitled to demand the price as on the date of final
letter of allotment, Ex. P. 11 has been found to be the
letter of allotment which has not been assailed before
us. Even though the appeal arises out of a civil suit
and parties had laid evidence in the forums below and
no evidence was laid indicating the enhancement of
cost of land on account of any development work. Yet
the appellant being a public authority, this Court had
directed by order dated 23.9.1996 to place materials


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">               (Downloaded on 28/06/2019 at 01:53:44 AM)</span>

to indicate any development effected to the plaintiffs
plot from the date of possession given to the plaintiffs
and the resultant enhancement of the price. It was
also indicated that the defendants-appellants should
also indicate how many more cases of this type are
pending. Pursuant to the aforesaid order a letter dated
16.1.1990 from the Chief Administrator, Haryana
Development Authority to the Estate Officer, HUDA,
Gurgaon    has   been       filed     whereunder          the   Chief
Administrator had directed the Estate Officer to charge
at the current rate of Rs. 560.60 per square metre
while issuing the final allotment letter. The appellants
have also produced a copy of the Resolution of the
authority enhancing the price of the land to Rs. 560.60
per square metre. But these documents are of no
assistance to the appellants inasmuch as the final
letter of allotment (Ex. P. 11) was dated 24.11.1989
much prior to the issuance of letter from the Chief
Administrator to the Estate Officer dated 16.1.1990.
That apart by order of this Court dated 23.9.1996 the
appellants were called upon to place materials to
indicate if any further development to the plaintiffs'
land has been made from the date of possession given
to them but no such materials have been placed
before us. The so-called Resolution alleged to have
been passed by the authority enhancing the price of
the land will not be applicable to the plaintiffs' plot in
whose case the final letter of allotment had been
issued on 24.11.1989 as per Ex. P. 11. In the
aforesaid circumstances we find no justification for our
interference with the impugned judgment of the High
Court affirming the decision of the learned Additional
District Judge. This appeal is accordingly dismissed but
in the circumstances there will be no order as to
costs."

that out of total 74 houses comprising of 34 houses in HIG

have taken refund with interest and the petitioners were also free

to withdraw the said amount.

<p id="p_112">46.        Learned counsel for the respondent also submitted that

the petitioners were well aware about escalation in price on

account of various factors; for example, the respondents have

incurred a cost of Rs.559.68 lacs towards laying down of sewerage

line, a cost of Rs.249.23 lacs for laying down of water supply line

in addition to cost for street lights, transformers etc., and those

expenses have been incurred after issuance of reservation letter,

and therefore, the respondent cannot afford to offer houses on the

price tentatively offered in the brochure.

<p id="p_113">47.        Learned counsel for the respondent further submitted

that the petitioners were entitled to withdraw the amount with

interest on or before the due date of depositing the amount, since

as many as 23 persons have already taken the refund of the

amount deposited by them.

      allotment of houses shall be made on "No Profit, No Loss" basis
      and the sale price of the house shall be determined by the

      three instalments of Rs.1,00,000/- each, which the petitioner
      deposited in stipulated period. As per draw, which was held on

Housing Board, Hanumangarh colony was allotted to him. The
contractor completed the house in the month of June 2011 but
allotment-cum-demand letter was not issued to him. On 13 th of
October 2011, a letter was issued by the Board, whereby the
land price was determined as Rs.3,760/- per sq.mtr. and the
petitioner was asked to deposit Rs.8,88,300/- for 236.25
sq.mtrs. land, and for extra land measuring 21 sq.mtrs. a sum
of Rs.5,640/- per sq.mtr. was charged from him. The petitioner
was asked to deposit the requisite amount before taking
possession of the house. The cost of construction was also
demanded from the petitioner to the tune of Rs.12,51,600/.
Precisely, in the writ petition the petitioner has assailed the
escalated land price by categorizing the same as arbitrary and
unreasonable in clear violation of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_27">Article 14.</a> In ground (d) of the
writ petition, petitioner has specifically pleaded that similar
controversy came up before this Court in 1992 and while
allowing the writ petition the Court has granted relief to the
allottees. The averments contained in ground (d) are reproduced
as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_39">      "(d) That similar controversy came up before this
      Court in the year 1992, at that time similar kind of
      Scheme of the Board was launched for the HIG
      Group and while making the allotment of the house,
      the Board charged the High Price for the second,
      third    and      fourth    quarters,      this    Hon'ble    Court
      allowed the writ petition of those persons while
      taking into consideration the costing principles
      Rules issued vide notification dated 09/01/1988.
      The Hon'ble Court held that as per Rule 4 of that
      Rule, the Board cannot increase the price of land
      arbitrarily and can only charge the price of land for
      the     year     in   which     the     land      is   utilized   for
      construction of the houses and it was held that the
      Board can charge the High Price of Land only by
      adding 12% of the price of earlier year. But in the
      present case the Board has charged the different
      price of land for the same year for the similar
      persons without any basis. The demand raised by
      the Board by increasing the price of the land as per
      Annexure P/3 is contrary to the judgment of this

<p id="p_118">      After issuance of notice, reply was submitted on behalf of
respondent No.3. In the reply, a preliminary objection was
raised regarding maintainability of the writ petition by asserting
that the writ petition involves disputed questions of facts which
cannot be gone into in summary proceedings under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_28">Article 226</a>
of the Constitution of India. Joining issue with the petitioner, the
respondent has pleaded in the reply that the judgment of this
Court reported in 1993 (3) WLC Raj. 391 is not holding the field
and the same has been reversed by the Division Bench of this
Court in Rajasthan Housing Board &amp; Ors. Vs. Awasan Mandal
Parijat Uncha Aywarg Sangarsh Saimiti (AIR 1996 Raj. 47). It is
also averred in the reply that the said verdict of the Division
Bench has been upheld by the Hon'ble Apex Court by dismissing
the SLP preferred by the consumers. While adverting to the
merits of the case, it is averred in the reply that construction of
the house was completed in August 2011, and thereafter
process of determination of final costing for houses of Higher
Income Group was sanctioned from Headquarter on 14.09.2011
and the requisite sanction was conveyed on 14.09.2011 and
accordingly allotment was made on 13.10.2011. The positive
assertion of the petitioner that house was completed in the
month of June 2011 was denied. On the issue of cost of land, it
is pleaded that for the year 2011-12 rate of Rs.3,760/- per
sq.mtr. was fixed by the Headquarter. It is also submitted in the
reply that as per the principle of final costing of the Board for
the year 2010, the cost of additional developed land was worked
out by adding 50% extra to the basic developed land cost, and
ancillary service charges are recovered in one instalment before
handing over possession at the rate of 3% for MIG-A, MIG-B,
HIG and SFS houses. In the return, it is submitted by the
respondent that allotment letter was issued to the petitioner on


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_32">                 (Downloaded on 28/06/2019 at 01:53:44 AM)</span>

13 th of October 2011 and final costing was made on 14 th
September 2011 at the rate prevailing for the year 2011-12
whereas the houses of the Scheme at Hanumangarh and
Suratgarh where were completed and allotment letters were
issued to the allottees before commencement of July 2011 and
the prevailing rates of the year 2011-12 were applied as per the
principle of costing of the Board. While referring to the brochure
of SRS 2008, it is averred in the reply that price of land is
determined as per the brochure inasmuch as the same was
determined at the time of allotment and therefore in terms of
brochure any objection in this behalf at the behest of allottee is
not entertainable. Defending the action of the Board, it is also
submitted in the reply that in determining the rates of land,
following expenditures are also included:
</p>

<p id="p_119">(i)Leveling, dressing of the ground,
</p><p id="p_120">(i)Construction of bitumous roads,
</p><p id="p_121">(ii)Construction of drains and culverts,

</p><p id="p_126">(vii)Construction   of    school     buildings   and    dispensary/health
centres etc.
       The respondent has also pleaded that approximately 50%
land is left for the facilities of general public and construction
work is carried only upon approximately 50% of the land. The
allegation of the petitioner that the Board has charged high price
of land is specifically denied.
</p><p id="p_127">       Learned counsel for the petitioner has argued that the
respondents have arbitrary charged exorbitant price for land
from petitioner in clear violation of SRS 2008 and therefore a
direction is required to be issued for issuance of revised
possession letter after recalculating the cost of extra land by re-
assessing cost of premium and extra land, or in the alternative it
is liable to be set aside. In the alternative, the learned counsel
has argued that for extra land the same rate per square meter is
to be applied which is given in the original allotment letter.
</p><p id="p_128">       Per contra, learned counsel for the respondent has
submitted that there is no infirmity is the cost of premium and
extra land and as such no interference in the present petition is

warranted. Learned counsel for the respondent has urged that in
view of clear stipulation in Clause 20 of the Brochure, grievance
of the petitioner is not entertainable inasmuch as it is mentioned
in the said clause with clarity and precision that cost shall be
determined by the Board at the time of allotment and no
grievance of the allottee in this behalf shall be entertained.
</p><p id="p_129">      Learned counsel for the respondent has also submitted
that the entire edifice of the writ petition is based on judgment
of this Court reported in 1993 (3) WLC (Raj.) 391, and as the
same has been reversed by the Division Bench and subsequently
affirmed by the Hon'ble Apex Court, therefore, petition is liable
to be rejected.
</p><p id="p_130">      I have heard learned counsel for the parties and perused
the materials available on record.
</p><p id="p_131">      Cause of grievance of the petitioners in the present
petitions relates to premium of land and cost of extra land and
for quashment of the allotment letter dated 13 th of October
2011 (Annex.3) to that extent. The petitioners have also craved
for recalculating the cost of extra land at par for which the house
is to be allotted. A direction is also sought to calculate the cost
of land in terms of judgment of this Court reported in WLC (Raj.)
1993 (3) Page 391 (Avashan Mandal Parijat Uch Ayavargh
Sangarsh Samiti &amp; Anr. Vs. Rajasthan Housing Board &amp; Ors.).
</p><p id="p_132">      Upon close scrutiny of the matter, in the considered
opinion of this Court, the entire grievance of the petitioner is
essentially founded on the judgment rendered in Avashan
Mandal Parijat Uch Ayavargh Sangarsh Samiti's case (supra),
wherein the writ petitions were allowed in part with the following
directions:

      amount of accounting, calculations and moreover,
      they relate to non-statutory conditions of the
      contract. However, sofaras the cost of the land is
      concerned, about that Rules in the Shape of the
      Costing Principles are there, which have been

      the Rajasthan Housing Board from these allottees
      of second, third and fourth quarters of 1988 Parijat
      Scheme is over and above the one which has been
      charged from the applicants of the first quarter of
      1988 Parijat Scheme on the basis of the aforesaid

      year of utilisation of land for construction of houses

      land cannot arbitrarily be allowed to be increased
      from Rs. 38,178/- to Rs. 72,765/-. The respondents
      are, therefore, directed to issue revised possession-
      letters to the petitioners by changing the cost of the
      land keeping in view the land utilisation made by
      them for construction of houses for the applicants

</p><p id="p_135">45. We are further of the opinion that the costing
principles     could    not     be    made     a    matter    of
interference under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_29">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of
India. Again, the writ petition could not be filed by
the self styled Society jointly as there was a
different cause of action to each of the allottees and
the petitioner neither being a registered Society nor
a juristic person, the petition filed by it was thus
incompetent and not maintainable.
</p><p id="p_136">46. The jurisdiction vested in the High Court under
<a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_30">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India is to be used
only sparingly and that too only in exceptional
cases where there is a violation or infringement of

other adequate, alternate or specific remedy. No
case of infringement of any right of the petitioner
has been made out.
</p><p id="p_137">47. The matter can be viewed from another angle.
How would a writ lie in respect of non-statutory
contract. The Scheme containing the terms and
conditions was too well known to the allottees
before they put in the applications for the purpose
of registration. It was indicated sufficiently well that
the price that was being fixed tentative and
approximate and that the final costing would be
made at the completion of the houses and the
increased amount would be charged from the
allottees.
</p><p id="p_138">48. We are of the view that the writ petition in the
present      case      was    neither     maintainable       nor
competent. We further hold that the petitioner had
no locus standi to challenge the action of the Board.
We also find that highly disputed questions of fact
and accounting were involved in the matter, which
just could not have been permitted to be raised in
the extraordinary writ jurisdiction of this Court. We
also hold that since it was pure and simple a non-
statutory contract, the parties to the lis are
governed by the terms and conditions laid down in
the Scheme. The same could not form a subject

</p><p id="p_139">      49. The writ petitions in our view could be

      into other questions. But since the learned single

      examine the matter on merits and partly allowed
      the petitions, we had to deal with the merits of the
      case to negative the conclusion drawn on merits by
      the learned single Judge. Arguments before us were
      also raised on merits by the learned counsel
      appearing for the parties and therefore in all

<blockquote id="blockquote_44">      "After going through the pleadings of the parties in
      his behalf, we are of the opinion that the land cost
      which was determined of the Housing Board is in
      consonance with the brochure and the costing
      principles reflected in paragraphs 4.1 to 4.1.5,
      4.2.1, 4.2.3, 4.2.5 and 4.2.6. It was urged on
      behalf of the appellants that although construction
      of the houses of the first and second quarter was
      completed when the possession of the houses was
      allotted   to   the   allotted    of   first   quarter   and
      therefore, there was no justification in not issuing
      the letters of allotment to the allotted of second
      quarter. This contention has no merit because the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_37">                 (Downloaded on 28/06/2019 at 01:53:44 AM)</span>

      development word was yet to be completed and,
      consequently the possession thereof was delayed
      by about nine months. Since the allotment letters
      of the houses of second quarter fell during the
      financial    year   1990-91,       the    land    cost        stood
      enhanced in view of the costing principles. The
      same was true in respect of third and fourth
      quarter houses as the letters of allotment were
      issued in the financial year 1991-92 on different
      dates i.e. 9th December, 1991 and 5th February,
      1992      respectively.     The     construction        of      the
      construction of the houses in respect of second and
      third quarters was delayed beyond the control of
      the Housing Board. Consequently, the land cost was
      required to be re-determined on the basis of
      costing principles. All these factors were very much
      known to the Rajasthan Housing Board and they
      were fully aware of the terms and conditions set
      out in the brochure and other relevant Rules and
      Regulations. We have carefully considered the
      contentions raised on behalf of the parties in this
      behalf and we find that the Rajasthan Housing
      Board had committed on error while determining
      the land cost differently in respect of second, third
      and fourth quarter based on the costing principles.
      It also needs to be stated that the Rajasthan
      Housing Board had borrowed huge sums from
      various     financial   institutions     for   which     it    was
      required to pay the interest thereon. The appellants
      are unable to demonstrate that the land cost
      determined by the Rajasthan Housing Board was in
      violation of any of the terms and terms and
      conditions mentioned in the brochure and/or Rules

touchstone of settled legal proposition that disputed questions of
fact are not liable to be adjudicated in writ jurisdiction, I am not

to show that the respondent Board has acted arbitrarily while
assessing the land cost as the pleadings in the writ petitions in
this behalf are conspicuously silent.
</p><p id="p_144">      One more redeeming fact is that the brochure, which was
issued by the Board while floating the Scheme of 2008, clearly
envisages that no complaint of the allottee with respect to land
cost shall be entertained and the cost determined by the Board
at the time of allotment shall be final. The Board has also
asserted in the said clause that Board would make endeavor to
keep the price of the house moderate but any escalation in the
construction cost for unforeseen reason, which is beyond the
control of the Board, shall be borne by the respective allottee.

      that there is any element of profit at any stage in the
      calculation of cost, rather on the other hand, the
      prices were reduced during the pendency of the writ
      petition, which shows that the attitude and conduct of
      the Board was not to earn profit out of the Scheme.
      Again, the weaker sections of the Society have also to
      be provided houses sometimes at subsidised rates in
      such a situation. If the allottees in the higher income
      group have to pay a little more, the same cannot be
      held to be discriminatory or arbitrary. How can a
      mandamus be granted that a particular house has to
      be allotted at a given price, which according to the
      petitioner, has to be calculated in the manner he
      desires. The Board is charging only the additional cost.

      authorised in exercise of its powers to enhance the

      completed, in which cases pricing is generally market

offered themselves for registration for allotment of flats
that may be constructed by the Authority for MIG scheme.
</blockquote><p id="p_150">After the registration and when the flats were constructed
and ready for occupation brochures were issued by the
Authority. One such brochure for allotment of MIG flats in
Lawrence Road residential scheme is Annexure R-1. This
brochure specifies the terms and conditions including price
on which flat will be offered. It also reserved the right to
surrender or cancel the registration, the mode and method
of paying the price and handing over the possession. There
is an application form annexed to the brochure. Annexure
'A' to the brochure sets out the price of flat on the ground
floor, first floor and second floor respectively. It sets out
the premium amount payable for land as also the total cost
in respect of the flats on the ground floor, first floor and
second floor. The statement also shows the earnest money
deposited at the time of the registration and the balance
payable. It is on the basis of these brochures that the
applicants applied for the flats in Lawrence Road and other
MIG schemes. They knew and are presumed to know the
contents of the brochure and particularly the price payable.
They offered to purchase the flats at the price oil which the
Authority offered to sell the same. After the lots were
drawn and they were lucky enough to be found eligible for
allotment of flats, each one of them paid the price set out
in the brochure and took possession of the flat, and thus
sale became complete. There is no suggestion that there
was a mis-statement or incorrect statement or any
fraudulent concealment in the information supplied in the
brochure published by the Authority on the strength of
which they applied and obtained flats. How the seller works
out his price is a matter of his own choice unless it is
subject to statutory control. Price of property is in the
realm or contract between a seller and buyer. There is no
obligation on the purchaser to purchase the flat at the price
offered. Even after registration the registered applicants
may opt for other schemes. His right to enter into other
scheme   opting   out    of    present      offer    is    not   thereby

the available flats that lots had to be drawn. With this
background the petitioners now contend that the Authority
has collected surcharge as component of price which the
Authority was not authorised or entitled to collect. Even if
there may be any merit in this contention, though there is
none, such a relief of refund cannot be the subject-matter
of a petition under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_34">Article 32.</a> And <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_35">Article 14</a> cannot
camouflage the real bone of contention. Conceding for this
submission that the Authority has the trappings of a State
or would be comprehended in 'other authority' for the
purpose of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_36">Article 12</a>, while determining price of flats
constructed by it, it acts purely in its executive capacity
and "is bound by the obligations which dealings of the
State   with   the   individual     citizens     import     into   every
transaction entered into the exercise of its constitutional
powers. But after the State or its agents have entered into
the field of ordinary contract, the relations are no longer
governed by the Constitutional provisions but by the legally
valid contract which determines rights and obligations of
the parties inter se. No question arises of violation of
<a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_37">Article 14</a> or of any other constitutional provision when the
State or its agents, purporting to act within this field,
perform any act. In this sphere, they can only claim rights
conferred upon them by contract and are bound by the
terms of the contract only unless some statute steps in and
confers some special statutory power or obligation on the

obligation to seek allotment of flats even after they had
registered themselves. They looked at the price and flats
and applied for the flats. This they did voluntarily. They
were advised by the brochures to look at the flats before
going in for the same. They were lucky enough to get
allotment when the lots were drawn. Each one of them was
allotted a flat and he paid the price voluntarily. They are

      the benefit under the contract, namely, surrender of flat.
      The Authority in its affidavit in reply in terms stated that it
      is willing to take back the fiats and to repay them the full
      price. The transaction is complete, viz., possession of the
      flat is taken and price is paid. At a later stage when they
      are secure in possession with title, petitioners are trying to
      get back a part of the purchase price and thus trying to re-
      open and wriggle out of a concluded contract only partially.
      In a similar and identical situation a Constitution Bench of
      this Court in Har Shankar and Ors. etc. etc. v. The Dy.
      Excise &amp; Taxation Commr. and Ors. : [1975]3SCR254 has
      observed that those who contract with open eyes must
      accept the burdens of the contract along with its benefits.
      Reciprocal rights and obligations arising out of contract do
      not   depend   for   their   enforceability        upon    whether   a
      contracting party finds it prudent to abide by the terms of
      the contract. By such a test no contract would ever have a
      binding force. The jurisdiction of this Court under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_39">Article 32</a>
      of the Constitution is not intended to facilitate avoidance of
      obligations voluntarily incurred. It would thus appear that
      petitions ought not to have been entertained. However, as
      the petitions were heard on merits, the contentions
      canvassed on behalf of the petitioners may as well be
      examined."

      1984, possession of the flats could not be delivered
      because of the dispute pending in the Court which
      also contributed to the increase in the cost of the flat
      Admittedly, the respondents came in possession of
      the   flats   in    the     year      1984.      In    the     facts   and
      circumstances of the case, we are satisfied that no
      interference was called for by the High Court."

<p id="p_157">56.           After hearing learned counsel for the parties as well as

examining the record of the case, alongwith the precedent laws

cited at the Bar, this Court finds that the scheme for duplex

houses in Sectors 11 and 12 of Mukta Prasad Nagar, Bikaner,

which was a self finance scheme, has required the respondents to

provide such houses to the petitioners in their respective

categories.

</p><p id="p_159">57.          This Court finds that the total records of the case

indicate that though the respondents were having the power to

revise/escalate/enhance the costs, which were earlier envisaged,

but an impression was given to the petitioners that the cost shall

not be escalated for more than 10%, whereas the escalation in

cost is far beyond the same.
</p>

<p id="p_160">58.   The respondent-Board, which operates on no profit basis

however, seems to have miscalculated its cost; but once the cost

has been incurred, then at this stage of allotment asking the

respondent-Board not to take the cost, which has incurred on the

scheme, would be extremely unfair.
</p>

<p id="p_161">59.          This Court has also carefully seen the precedent law

cited by both the parties, finds that the petitioners could not

establish any such glaring example, which could demonstrate that

the cost escalation was due to the arbitrariness or illegalities

committed by the respondent.
</p>

<p id="p_162">60.          On examination of the complete records, this Court

finds that certain amenities, like sewerage systems, installation of

water supply systems, road network, reconstruction of roads,

street lights etc. for the complete sector, which were not

completely      envisaged       by      the       respondent-Board,   have

subsequently, led to such cost escalation.

</p><p id="p_164">61.           On a careful perusal of the record, this Court also finds

that the respondent-Board has shown the details in which they

have referred to various heads and various rates, which clearly

indicate that the respondent-Board was left with no option, but to

escalate the cost. Moreover, the petitioners cannot be said to be

prejudiced because the respondent-Board is offering their money

back alongwith prevailing interest, and thus, if the petitioners are

finding it so unaffordable, then they can certainly get the refund

back. However, it is for sure that there would have been a

legitimate expectation of the petitioners that the escalation would

not be more than 10%, and therefore, the respondent-Board

needs to be more careful, while launching such schemes and

needs to give a definite escalation clause whenever in future they

come up with a policy or scheme, so that the applicants would not

suffer at the belated stage, with a beyond expectation higher

escalation.
</p>

<p id="p_165">62.           Though all the precedent laws are variant on facts, but

the precedent law of Mangat Ram Taneja (supra) is quite near

to the present dispute being adjudicated and it is based upon a

Division Bench and the Hon'ble Apex Court judgments.
</p>

<p id="p_166">63.           In light of the aforesaid observations, the present writ

petitions are dismissed. However, this Court directs the Rajasthan

Housing Board to give the exact details of the costs in their

scheme brochures in future, and while giving the probable

escalation clauses, approximate idea to the applicants regarding
