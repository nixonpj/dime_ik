<p id="p_1">      This is an application for special leave to appeal against


the   judgment   in   C.C.No.443/2006   on   the   file   of   the     Judicial


Magistrate   of   First   Class,   Kayamkulam.     It   is   stated   in   the


complaint   that   the   2nd  respondent   had   issued   a   cheque     in


favour   of   the     petitioner/complainant     for   discharge     of   an


amount   of   Rupees   Two   lakhs   and   when   the   cheque   was


presented for  encashment, the same  was dishonoured  on the


ground of  insufficiency of fund  in the  account of the  account


holder.       After    receipt   of  intimation     from   the   Bank   and     on


complying     the   statutory     provisions   regarding     notice,     the


petitioner/complainant filed  the complaint.  To prove the case


against the  2nd respondent, the petitioner/complainant himself


was   examined   as   PW1   and     other     two   witnesses   were   also


examined.       Exts.P1   to  P6     were   also   produced.       On   closing


the     evidence   of   the   complainant,     the   2nd  respondent     was


questioned   under   <a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_1">Section   313</a>   of   the   Code   of   Criminal


Procedure.     The 2nd   respondent had denied her signature  in


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">CRL.L.P.NO.99/2007                     2</span>



  the   cheque   and   even   the   ownership   of   the     account     from


  which     the   alleged   cheque   has   been   issued.         The   2nd


  respondent     also   disputed   the   transaction     between   the


  appellant   and   her     which   is   the   subject   matter   of   the


  complaint.          After   having     considered   the  entire     evidence


  adduced   by   the   complainant,   the   trial   court   found   that   the


  petitioner/complainant     miserably     failed   to   prove   that   the


  cheque   is     singed   by   the     2nd  respondent   and   the   cheque


  belongs to the  account  of the 2nd respondent.   The trial court


  also   found   that   the   appellant   failed   to   prove     the   financial


  transaction     which     obliged   to   issue   the   cheque   by   the   2nd


  respondent   to the complainant.   In the above circumstances,


  the trial court acquitted  the  2nd respondent.





</p><p id="p_2">  2.    This Court  heard the learned  counsel appearing for the


  petitioner/complainant  and   had  perused     the  judgment  of  the


  trial   court.     After   considering   the   entire   matter   afresh,   this


  Court is of  the  view that  the    trial  court had  considered   the


  evidence adduced before the court.   It could be seen that the


  appellant had not proved any case against the 2nd  respondent


  with regard to the issuance of the cheque or to prove that the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">CRL.L.P.NO.99/2007                      3</span>



  cheque was signed by the  2nd respondent.   Further there is no


  evidence   to   show   that     any   financial   transaction     existed


  between the appellant and the 2nd  respondent so as to   oblige


  the   2nd  respondent     to   issue     any   cheque     as   alleged   in   the


  complainant.  In the above circumstances, the judgment of the


  trial court  requires no interference by this Court.


</p><p id="p_3">        Accordingly,  the leave to appeal stands dismissed,




                                                  K. THANKAPPAN, JUDGE.
