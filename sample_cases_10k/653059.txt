                         -----------------------------------------

                  Dated this the 12th day of  February, 2007


                                      JUDGMENT
</pre>

<p id="p_1">Kurian Joseph,J.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">       These   appeals   are   at   the   instance   of   the   defendants.       The


plaintiffs are the respondents.   The suits were filed claiming damages.


Since   there   is   no   serious   dispute   as   to   the   factual   position,   it   is   not


necessary to reproduce the whole averments or contentions.   The suits


were   instituted   claiming   damages   for   the   loss   alleged   to   have   been


suffered by the plaintiffs on account of a fire in the Exhibition ground


in   connection   with   the   All   India   Agricultural,   Industrial   and   Arts


Exhibition,1988, on 19-9-1988.  The stalls, fencing etc. were destroyed


and thus the loss.  The defendant Corporation contended that it had no


liability to compensate for the loss in terms of the contract.   The trial


court addressed the question regarding liability and found on the basis


of   evidence   that   the   kitchen   attached   to   the   stall   was   having   only   a


thatched   roof.     It   was   contrary   to   the   instruction   in   Ext.A3.


Inflammable  materials were used for the kitchen stall.  It has also come

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                            -:2:-</span>


out   in   evidence   of   DW1   that   the   fire   started   from   the   kitchen   and   it


spread over to the other stalls.  Thus it was rightly concluded that if the


kitchen   stall   was  erected  by   using   non-inflammable   materials   as   per


Ext.A3 instruction it would not have been destroyed by fire and there


would not have been any possibility for the fire to spread to other stalls


and thus there was culpable negligence.   Exts.P6 and P7 are the reports


on the extent and approximate damages suffered by the parties and as a


matter   of   fact   the   defendant/appellant   Corporation   itself   had   taken   a


decision--Ext.B8 dated 31-1-1989 to compensate the loss.   The court


below on the basis of evidence mainly discussed above and decreed the


suits as follows:-

</p>
<p id="p_9">
In all the appeals, there is a direction to deposit the principal amount


and liberty is also granted to withdraw the same.


</p><p id="p_10">       2.     Sri.Nandakumara   Menon,   learned   counsel   appearing   for   the


appellant, though   raised several  contentions,  had  to  confine  emphasis


mainly on two aspects, in view of Ext.B8 resolution of the Corporation


itself   regarding   the   loss:   (1)   the   decree   with   regard   to   interest   with


effect  from  1-2-1989   is   patently   wrong,   unjust   and   unreasonable;   (2)


the plaintiff in O.S.No.879/1991 had not in fact suffered any damages.


</p><p id="p_11">       3.     As   far   as   the   case   of   the   plaintiff   in   O.S.No.879/1991   is


concerned, the contention is that Exts,B6 and B7 reports had not taken


note   of   the   loss   suffered   by   the   plaintiff   therein.     The   plaintiff   was


examined as P.W.4.  Ext.A19 is the allotment letter of the stall.   There


A.S. Nos.491,492,494 &amp; 497/1997

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                            -:4:-</span>


is   no   dispute   that   he   had   paid   the   required   charges   including   that   of


water   and   electricity.     There   is   also   no   dispute   that   the   stall   was


completely gutted by fire.  Based on the statement filed by the plaintiff


before   the   Enquiry   Commission   and   marked   as   Ext.A25,   Ext.A26


notice   as   acknowledged   by   Ext.A27,   were   also   issued   claiming


damages. The various bills produced by the plaintiff indicated that the


plaintiff had purchased materials worth more than Rs.50,000/-. Though


it was difficult to assess the exact extent of damages, taking note of the


totality of evidence a rough  estimate of Rs.20,000/- was made by the


court  below  as  damages in  respect  of  the  items  available  in   the  stall.


Towards the damages caused to the Yezdi Motor  Bike, in view of the


admission   made   by   DW1,   an   amount   of   Rs.7,000/-   was   fixed   as   the


loss and thus a decree for Rs.27,000/- was passed.


</p><p id="p_12">       4.  Sri.Nandakumara Menon vehemently contended that there was


no   evidence   at   all   so   as   to   sustain   the   decree.     We   are   afraid   the


contentions cannot be appreciated.  Even in the written statement, it is


admitted   that   stall   No.54   was   allotted   to   the   plaintiff.     It   is   also


admitted   in   the   written   statement   that   "the   plaintiff   incurred   some


A.S. Nos.491,492,494 &amp; 497/1997

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                            -:5:-</span>


losses   due   to   destruction   of   items   kept   in   the   stall".     That   apart   as


properly discussed in the judgment by the trial court, the fact that the


stall was completely gutted by fire is admitted and that serious damage


was caused to the motor bike is also admitted.  The dispute is only with


regard   to   the   quantum.     On   the   basis   of   the   bills   produced   by   the


plaintiff   only   the   assessment   has   been   made   to   Rs.20,000/-.     Yet


another contention was that there was no permission to take the motor


bike near the stall.  The court below has rightly rejected the contention


on   the   basis   of   evidence   holding   that   there   was   nothing   available   on


evidence to show that there was no permission to take the motor bike


near the stall.   Thus in the facts and circumstances of the case and on


the basis of the available materials in evidence and also the evidence of


PW4 and DW1 it cannot be said that the court below erred in awarding


the damages to  the tune of Rs.20,000/- for  the  items  kept  in the stall


and to the tune of Rs.7,000/- for the damages caused to the motor bike.


</p><p id="p_13">       5.     As   far   as   interest   is   concerned,   there  cannot  be   any  dispute


that   under   Section   34   of   the   Code   of   Civil   Procedure   a   plaintiff   is


entitled to interest  at reasonable rates  from the date of the suit  to the


A.S. Nos.491,492,494 &amp; 497/1997

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                            -:6:-</span>


date   of   the   decree   on   the   principal   sum   in   addition   to   any   interest


adjudged on such principal sum for any period prior to the institution


of the suit with further interest not exceeding 6% per annum.  The trial


court granted interest at 12% with effect from 1-2-1989 solely on the


basis of Ext.B8 resolution of the Corporation dated 31-1-1989. But it


has   to   be   appreciated   that   though   the   Corporation   resolved   to


compensate the loss suffered by the stall owners, the implementation of


the decision was subject to sanction from the Government.  There is no


case for  the plaintiffs   that despite sanction from the  Government,  the


Corporation did not disburse the amounts.  On the contrary the stand by


the   Corporation   is   that   the   Government   refused   to   grant   sanction.


Therefore,   the   plaintiffs   are   not   in   any   case   entitled   to   interest   with


effect from 1-2-1989,  the day following Ext.B8 resolution.   Similarly


the   transaction   admittedly   being   not   commercial   and   the   suits   being


only for damages, the plaintiffs are entitled only to 6% interest from the


date of the judgment.  Accordingly the decree and judgment in all these


cases   are   modified   in   the   matter   of   interest.     The   plaintiffs   will   be


entitled to interest at the rate of 12%  only from the date of institution

of the suit till the date of decree and thereafter at the rate of 6% till the


date of deposit of the principal amount.
