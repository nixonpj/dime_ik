Narayan Chandra Ghosh 						    ..Appellant 

Versus 

Kanailal Ghosh &amp; Others 						.Respondents 

B.N.AGRAWAL, J. 
</p>
<p id="p_2">	These appeals by the defendants arise out of common judgment 
rendered by the High Court in second appeals.  
</p><p id="p_3">The short facts are that the plaintiffs filed two suits, viz., Title Suit          
Nos. 125 of 1978 and 146 of 1977 for eviction of defendants.  Both the suits 
relate to eviction of defendants from different portions of a house.  The former 
suit related to eviction from three rooms and the latter from one room.  In both 
the suits, the plaintiffs were thika tenants whereas defendants were Bharatias.   
The grounds for eviction disclosed in the suits were default, causing nuisance 
by the defendants and bona fide need of the plaintiffs for the premises in 
question as number of their family members had substantially increased.  
When the suits were filed, The Calcutta Thika Tenancy Act, 1949 (hereinafter 
referred to as 'the 1949 Act') was in force.  During the pendency of the 
aforesaid suits, The Calcutta Thika  Tenancy (Acquisition and <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_1">Regulation) Act</a>, 
1981 (hereinafter referred to as 'the 1981 Act') was promulgated and as, 
according to the plaintiffs, the said suits abated under <a href="/doc/739245/" id="a_2">Section 19</a> of the 1981 
Act, the plaintiffs filed another suits giving rise to Title Suit Nos. 35 of 1983 
and 22 of 1983 for eviction of defendants from the aforesaid four rooms 
stating therein the same grounds for eviction. 
</p><p id="p_4">	Defendants contested the claim for eviction on grounds, inter alia, that 
the subsequent suits were not maintainable as earlier suits did not abate 
under <a href="/doc/739245/" id="a_3">Section 19</a> of the 1981 Act.  They denied all the grounds for eviction. 
	In support of their respective cases, both the parties led oral and 
documentary evidence and upon conclusion of trial, the learned Munsiff held 
that the suits were maintainable as the earlier suits abated under <a href="/doc/739245/" id="a_4">Section 19</a> 
of the 1981 Act.  So far as the grounds for eviction are concerned, the trial 
court decreed the suits only on the ground of bona fide necessity as, in its 
opinion, the plaintiffs failed to prove the other grounds.  Challenging the 
decrees of the trial court, when appeals were preferred, the lower appellate 
court upheld the decree for eviction in relation to three rooms but reversed the 
same in relation to one room and thereby dismissed suit for eviction in relation 
to the same.  Against the aforesaid decision, two appeals were preferred 
before the High Court, one by the plaintiffs and other by the defendants.  High 
Court upheld decision of the lower appellate court affirming eviction decree in 
relation to three rooms.  So far as decree of the lower appellate court 
dismissing the eviction suit in relation to one room is concerned, the same has 
been reversed and the decree for eviction in relation to same passed by the 
trial court has been restored.  Hence, these appeals by special leave. 
	Mr. Bhaskar Prasad Gupta, learned Senior Counsel appearing in 
support of the appeals raised various points but for the disposal of the 
appeals, only two points are relevant.  Firstly, it has been submitted that 
earlier two suits filed by the plaintiffs did not abate under <a href="/doc/739245/" id="a_5">Section 19</a> of the 
1981 Act, as such both the suits were liable to be dismissed on the ground 
that the same were not maintainable.  Secondly, it has been submitted that 
the High Court was not justified in interfering with the finding of fact in relation 
to one room in a second appeal.  On the other hand, Mr. S.B.Sanyal and Mr. 
Vijay Hansaria, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the respondents in their 
respective appeals, submitted that present suits were maintainable as earlier 
two suits abated under <a href="/doc/739245/" id="a_6">Section 19</a> of the 1981 Act.  Mr. Vijay Hansaria, 
appearing in support of the judgment of the High Court in relation to one 
room, submitted that the High Court was quite justified in reversing judgment 
rendered by lower appellate court and confirming the decree for eviction 
passed by the trial court. 
</p><p id="p_5">	Thus, the main question to be considered in the present appeals is as 
to whether the earlier suits abated under <a href="/doc/739245/" id="a_7">Section 19</a> of the 1981 Act?  In this 
regard, it would be necessary to refer to the history of the legislation.  The 
1949 Act was enacted for making better provision relating to the law of 
landlord and tenant in respect of thika  tenancies in Calcutta.  The expression 
"thika  tenant" has been defined under <a href="/doc/462798/" id="a_8">Section 2(5)</a> of the 1949 Act to mean a 
person who holds a land under a lease or otherwise under another person on 
payment of rent and has erected structure thereon or acquired by purchase or 
gift any structure on such land for residential, manufacturing or business 
purpose.  The expression "Bharatia" has been defined under <a href="/doc/462798/" id="a_9">Section 2(1)</a> of 
the 1949 Act to mean any person by whom, or on whose account, rent is 
payable for any structure or part of a structure erected by a thika  tenant in his 
holding.   Under <a href="/doc/1965985/" id="a_10">Section 3</a> of  1949 Act, three grounds for eviction of Thika   
tenant have been enumerated, namely, (I) using the holding in such a manner 
so as to render it unfit; (II) bona fide necessity of the landlord for the holding; 
and (III) in a case of lease, other than for residential purpose, expiry of the 
period of lease.  Under <a href="/doc/782097/" id="a_11">Section 5</a> of the 1949 Act, procedure has been 
provided for eviction of thika tenant by the landlord by filing an application for 
ejectment before Controller appointed by the State Government as defined 
under <a href="/doc/462798/" id="a_12">Section 2(2)</a> of the 1949 Act.  At this stage, it would be useful to refer to 
the provisions of <a href="/doc/462798/" id="a_13">Sections 2(1)</a>, <a href="/doc/462798/" id="a_14">2(2)</a>, <a href="/doc/462798/" id="a_15">2(5)</a>, <a href="/doc/1965985/" id="a_16">3</a> and <a href="/doc/782097/" id="a_17">5</a> of the 1949 Act which read 
thus:
</p><p id="p_6">"2(1)	"Bharatia" means any person by whom, or on whose 
account, rent is payable for any structure or part of a structure 
erected by a Thika   tenant in his holding. 
</p><p id="p_7">2(2)	"Controller" means an officer appointed as such by the 
State Government for an area to which this Act extends and 
includes any officer appointed by the State Government to 
perform all or any of the duties imposed or to exercise all or any 
of the powers conferred by this Act, on the Controller.
2(5)	"thika   tenant" means any person who holds, whether 
under a written lease or otherwise, land under another person, 
and is or but for a special contract would be liable to pay rent, at 
a monthly or at any other periodical rate, for that land to that 
another person and has erected or acquired by purchase or gift 
any structure on such land for a residential, manufacturing or 
business purpose and includes the successors in interest of 
such person, but does not include a person  
</p><p id="p_8">(a)	who holds such land under that another person in 
perpetuity; or 
</p><p id="p_9">(b)	who holds such land under that another person under a 
registered lease, in which the duration of the lease is 
expressly stated to be for a period of not less than twelve 
years; or 
</p><p id="p_10">(c)	who holds such land under that another person and uses 
or occupies such land as a khattal. 
</p><p id="p_11">3.	Grounds on which a thika   tenant may be ejected.  
(1)	Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for 
the time being in force or in any contract, a thika   tenant shall, 
subject to the other provisions of this Act, be liable to ejectment 
from his holding on one or more of the following grounds and 
not otherwise, namely:-
</p><p id="p_12">(i)	on the ground that he has used the land comprised in his 
holding in a manner which renders it unfit for any of the 
purposes mentioned in clause (5) of <a href="/doc/462798/" id="a_18">section 2</a>; 
</p><p id="p_13">(ii)	except during any period limited by a registered lease 
under which a thika   tenant may hold the land comprised 
in the holding and subject to the provisions of sub-
sections (2), (3) and (4), on the ground that the land is 
required by the landlord for his own occupation; 
</p><p id="p_14">(iii)	when he holds the land comprised in the holding under a 
registered lease for a purpose other than a residential 
purpose, on the ground that the term of  the lease has 
expired. 
</p><p id="p_15">(2)	No landlord shall be deemed to require the land 
comprised in the thika   tenant's holding for his own occupation 
if he has a house of his own in the city in which such land is 
situated and the accommodation available in such house is, in 
the opinion of the Controller, reasonably sufficient for him and 
his family. 
</p><p id="p_16">(3)	Where the landlord requires the land comprised in the 
thika   tenant's holding for his own occupation and the 
Controller is of opinion that such requirement may be 
substantially satisfied by ejecting the thika   tenant from a part 
only of his holding and allowing him to continue in occupation of 
the rest, then, if the thika   tenant agrees to such occupation, 
the Controller shall make an order accordingly and fix the 
proportionate rent for the portion remaining in the occupation of 
the thika   tenant. 
</p><p id="p_17">(4)	Where the thika   tenant has erected or acquired a pucca  
structure for a residential purpose on the land comprised in his 
holding, no order for ejectment shall be made against him 
except in respect of such part, if any, of such land as does not 
appertain to the pucca  structure. 
</p><p id="p_18">5.	Proceedings for ejectment.  (1)  Notwithstanding 
anything contained in any other law for the time being in force a 
landlord wishing to eject a thika   tenant on one or more of the 
grounds specified in <a href="/doc/1965985/" id="a_19">section 3</a> shall apply in the prescribed 
manner to the Controller for an order in that behalf and, on 
receipt of such application, the Controller shall, after giving the 
thika   tenant a notice to show cause within thirty days from the 
date of service of the notice why the application shall not be 
allowed and after making an inquiry in the prescribed manner 
either allow the application or reject it after recording the 
reasons for making such order, and, if he allows the application, 
shall make an order directing the thika   tenant to vacate the 
holding and, subject to the provisions of <a href="/doc/1306713/" id="a_20">section 10</a>, to put the 
landlord in possession thereof. 
</p><p id="p_19">(2)	No order allowing an application under sub-section (1) 
shall be made in a case where compensation is payable under 
the proviso to <a href="/doc/1506268/" id="a_21">section 4</a> unless and until the amount of 
compensation so payable has been either paid to the thika   
tenant or deposited with the Controller."
</p>
<p id="p_20">	It may be also useful to refer to the provisions of <a href="/doc/1306713/" id="a_22">Sections 10</a> and <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_23">10A</a> of 
the 1949 Act which read thus:
</p><p id="p_21">"10.	Consequences of the determination of interests of 
thika   tenants in certain cases.  (1)  Notwithstanding 
anything to the contrary contained in any contract, on the 
determination of the interest of a thika   tenant in the land 
comprised in a holding as a result of ejectment from the holding 
of, or of surrender or abandonment of the holding by, the Thika  
tenant, or otherwise, any structure standing upon such land and 
existing on the date of such determination shall vest in the 
landlord. 
</p><p id="p_22">(2)	When any structure standing on any holding of a Thika  
tenant vests in the landlord under sub-section (1) otherwise 
than as a result of ejectment of the Thika  tenant from the 
holding on the ground specified in clause (ii) of sub-section (1) 
of <a href="/doc/1965985/" id="a_24">section 3</a>, any Bharatia in possession of such structure or any 
part thereof, shall without any application being made be 
entitled to continue in such possession and shall be deemed to 
be a tenant in respect of such structure or part thereof, as the 
case may be, within the meaning of the West Bengal Premises 
Tenancy Act, 1956, holding under the landlord on the terms and 
conditions on which such Bharatia had been holding 
immediately before such structure vested in the landlord:
	Provided that nothing in this sub-section shall prevent 
either the landlord or such Bharatia so deemed to be a tenant 
holding under the landlord, from proceeding under the West 
Bengal Premises Tenancy Act, 1956, for fixing the standard rent 
payable in respect of such structure or part thereof, as the case 
may be. 
</p><p id="p_23">10A.	Right of thika tenant to erect pucca  structures.  (1)  
Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the 
time being in force or in any contract, but subject to the 
provisions of sub-sections (2) and (3), a thika  tenant using the 
land comprised in his holding for a residential purpose may 
erect a pucca  structure on such land for such purpose with the 
previous permission of the Controller.
</p><p id="p_24">(2)	On an application made by a thika  tenant in this behalf, 
the Controller may grant him permission to erect a pucca  
structure, if the Controller is satisfied that the thika  tenant  
</p><p id="p_25">(a)	is using the structure existing on the land comprised in 
his holding for a residential purpose, 
</p><p id="p_26">(b)	intends to use the pucca  structure to be erected on such 
land for a similar purpose, and 
</p><p id="p_27">(c)	has obtained sanction of a building plan to erect the 
pucca  structure from the municipal authorities of the 
area in which such land is situated. 
</p><p id="p_28">(3)	No thika  tenant shall be entitled to eject a Bharatia from 
the structure or part thereof in the possession of the Bharatia for 
the purpose of erecting a pucca  structure :
</p><p id="p_29">	Provided that the thika  tenant may by providing 
temporary alternative accommodation to a Bharatia obtain from 
him vacant possession of the structure in his possession on 
condition that immediately on the completion of the construction 
of the pucca  structure the thika  tenant shall offer the Bharatia 
accommodation in the pucca  structure at a rent which shall in 
no case exceed by more than twenty-five per centum the rent 
which the Bharatia was previously paying."
</p>
<p id="p_30">	<a href="/doc/1306713/" id="a_25">Section 10(1)</a> of the 1949 Act lays down that upon ejectment of a thika  
tenant, his interest in the holding shall be determined and the structures 
standing thereon shall vest in the landlord.  Sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/1306713/" id="a_26">Section 10</a> of 
the 1949 Act lays down that in case the order of eviction is on grounds (i) and 
</p><p id="p_31">(iii) of <a href="/doc/1965985/" id="a_27">Section 3(1)</a> of 1949 Act, in that eventuality, the Bharatia who is in 
possession of the structure shall be entitled to continue in such possession 
and shall be deemed to be a tenant in respect of such structures within the 
meaning of the West Bengal Premises Tenancy Act, 1956 ( in short 'the 
Premises Tenancy Act') in which he is residing and shall be holding the same 
under the landlord on the terms and conditions on which such Bharatia had 
been holding immediately before the structures vested in the landlord.  Under 
proviso to <a href="/doc/1796586/" id="a_28">Section 10(2)</a> of the 1949 Act, the landlord or the Bharatia would be 
entitled to make an application for fixation of standard rent in respect of such 
structure under the provisions of the Premises Tenancy Act and to that extent 
only the provisions of the said Act were made applicable. According to sub-
section (3) of <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_29">Section 10A</a> of the 1949 Act no thika  tenant shall be entitled to 
eject a Bharatia from the structure for the purpose of erecting a pucca  
structure but in case he intends to erect pucca  structure, in the premises in 
which a Bharatia is residing, he is required to provide temporary alternative 
accommodation to the Bharatia before obtaining possession for the purposes 
of putting pucca structure thereon and after completion thereof, such Bharatia 
shall be entitled to be put in possession of the pucca  structure on payment of 
rent which shall in no case exceed more than 25% of the rent which the 
Bharatia was previously paying.  
</p><p id="p_32">	From the aforesaid provisions, it becomes plain that under the 1949 Act, 
procedure was specifically provided for ejectment of a thika tenant by making 
an application for ejectment before the Controller but not for ejectment of a 
Bharatia by a thika tenant.  For ejectment of a Bharatia, only a suit for 
ejectment could be filed by a thika tenant before a Civil Court in case, he 
wanted to evict a Bharatia.  As Legislature of the State of West Bengal was 
contemplating legislation providing therein for the acquisition of interest of 
landlords in respect of lands comprised in thika tenancy and certain other 
tenancies, pending its enactment, a further legislation was enacted which was 
named The Calcutta Thika  Tenancy Stay of Proceedings (Temporary 
Provisions) Act, 1978 (hereinafter referred to as 'the 1978 Act') which came 
into force on 19th July, 1978 and continued to remain in force for a period of 
three years and six months from the date of its commencement.   This 
legislation was enacted to provide for temporary stay of proceedings for 
ejectment of thika   tenants and Bharatias holding under thika tenants.  It 
would be necessary to refer to the provisions of <a href="/doc/1965985/" id="a_30">Sections 3</a>,<a href="/doc/1506268/" id="a_31">4</a> and <a href="/doc/782097/" id="a_32">5</a> of the 1978 
Act which read thus:-
</p><p id="p_33">"3.  Stay of proceedings for ejectment of Thika   tenants. -  
Notwithstanding anything contained in the Calcutta Thika   
Tenancy Act, 1949, or in any other law for the time being in 
force, - 
</p><p id="p_34">	(a)	all applications for ejectment of Thika   tenants, 
</p><p id="p_35">	(b)	all appeals from orders made on such

ejectment of Thika   tenants. 
</p><p id="p_37">under the provisions of the Calcutta Thika   Tenancy Act, 1949, 
which are pending at the date of commencement of this Act or 
which may be made, preferred or commenced after such date 
but before the expiry of this Act, in respect of any land which is 
not a 'vacant land' within the meaning of the Urban Land 
(Ceiling and <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_33">Regulation) Act</a>, 1976, shall be stayed for the 
period during which this Act continues in force.
</p><p id="p_38">4.  Stay of suits and proceedings against Bharatias.  No 
thika  tenant shall, while this Act continues in force, commence, 
or continue with, any suit, appeal or proceedings in execution of 
orders, for ejectment of any Bharatia and all pending suits, 
appeals or proceedings in execution of orders, for ejectment of 
a Bharatia shall remain stayed. 
</p><p id="p_39">5.  Saving of limitation.  In computing the period of limitation 
prescribed by any law for the time being in force for an 
application for the ejectment of a thika tenant or for such a suit 
against a Bharatia or for an appeal from an order or decree 
made on such application or suit or for the execution of an order 
or decree for ejectment of a Thika  tenant or a Bharatia, as the 
case may be, the period during which this Act continues in force 
shall be excluded."
</p>
<p id="p_40">	Under <a href="/doc/1965985/" id="a_34">Section 3</a> of the 1978 Act, all proceedings for ejectment  of thika  
tenant initiated under the 1949 Act, irrespective of its stage, meaning thereby 
whether it was pending before the original authority or in appeal or in 
execution, were required to be stayed during the period of enforcement of the 
1978 Act and no further proceeding could be initiated after its commencement.   
Under <a href="/doc/1506268/" id="a_35">Section 4</a> of the 1978 Act a thika tenant was injuncted to commence 
any proceeding or continue such proceeding for ejectment of any Bharatia and 
all such proceedings if commenced stood stayed.  <a href="/doc/782097/" id="a_36">Section 5</a> of the 1978 Act 
provided that in computing the period of limitation for making an application for 
ejectment of a thika  tenant or for filing a suit against a Bharatia or for filing an 
appeal or for levying execution of an order or decree for ejectment of a thika  
tenant or a Bharatia, as the case may be, the period during which 1978 Act 
continued to remain in force had to be excluded.  
</p><p id="p_41">	Immediately after the 1978 Act expired, The Calcutta Thika   Tenancy 
(Acquisition and <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_37">Regulation) Act</a>, 1981 (hereinafter referred to as 'the 1981 
Act') was enacted which came into force with effect from 18th January, 1982.  
The said Act was enacted for the acquisition of interests of landlords in respect 
of lands comprised in thika tenancy and certain other tenancies.  According to 
<a href="/doc/782097/" id="a_38">Section 5</a> of the 1981 Act, with effect from the date of commencement of said 
Act, interest of the landlords in lands, inter alia, comprised in and appurtenant 
to tenancies of thika tenants including open areas, roads, passages, tanks, 
pools and drains vested in the State free from all incumbrances but the vesting 
did not in any manner affect rights enjoyed by thika tenants and Bharatias.  By 
virtue of  <a href="/doc/192399/" id="a_39">Section 6</a> of the 1981 Act, in spite of vesting, the thika tenant was 
entitled to continue in occupation of the said land, on such terms and 
conditions as may be prescribed, directly under the State as if the State had 
been the landlord in respect of that land and he would be liable to pay land 
revenue directly to the State.  Under <a href="/doc/7854/" id="a_40">Section 7</a> of the 1981 Act, a thika  tenant 
was not entitled to let out the vacant land to anybody but could create lease in 
respect of the structures.  The landlords were entitled to compensation for the 
lands acquired by the State of West Bengal in the manner provided under 
<a href="/doc/601175/" id="a_41">Section 8</a> of the 1981 Act.   <a href="/doc/1288796/" id="a_42">Section 9</a> of the 1981 Act lays down that monthly 
and other periodical tenancies of Bharatias in respect of structures occupied 
by them on payments of rent to the thika  tenants shall, with effect from the 
date of coming into force of 1981 Act, i.e., 18th January, 1982, be governed by 
the provisions of Premises Tenancy Act and for the said purpose, owners of 
the structures shall be deemed to be landlords and Bharatias shall be deemed 
to be tenants under the said Act.  <a href="/doc/1454833/" id="a_43">Section 11</a> of the 1981 Act lays down that 
tenancy of Bharatia as a tenant under thika  tenant shall not be extinguished 
because of subsequent non-existence of the structure which the Bharatia 
previously occupied under the thika  tenant and its tenancy shall continue.  
According to <a href="/doc/739245/" id="a_44">Section 19</a> of the 1981 Act, all proceedings for ejectment of thika  
tenants and Bharatias shall stand abated with effect from 19th day of July, 
1978 as if such proceedings had never been made.  It may be useful to refer to 
the provisions of <a href="/doc/1288796/" id="a_45">Sections 9</a>, <a href="/doc/1454833/" id="a_46">11</a> and <a href="/doc/739245/" id="a_47">19</a> referred to above which read thus:
"9.  Thika   tenants and Bharatias to be governed by <a href="/doc/688958/" id="a_48">West 
Bengal Act</a> 12 of 1956 .  (1)  The monthly and other periodical 
tenancies of Bharatias in respect of structures occupied by 
them on payment of rents to Thika   tenants shall, with effect 
from the date of coming into force of this Act, be governed by 
the provisions of the West Bengal Premises Tenancy Act, 1956, 
in all matters coming within the purview of the said Act and, for 
the said purpose, the owners of the structures shall be deemed 
to be landlords and the Bharatias shall be deemed to be 
tenants under the said Act. 
</p><p id="p_42">	(2)	Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act or 
in the West Bengal Premises Tenancy Act, 1956, a Bharatia 
under a Thika tenant shall be entitled to take separate electrical 
connection from the electricity supplying agency or separate 
water supply connection from the appropriate agency for his 
own use. 
</p><p id="p_43">11.  Tenancy of Bharatia to continue.  (1) Notwithstanding 
anything to the contrary contained in any other law for the time 
being in force, the tenancy of a Bharatia as a tenant under a 
thika  tenant shall not be extinguished because of subsequent 
non-existence of the structure or a part thereof which the 
Bharatia previously occupied under the thika  tenant. 
	(2)	If any structure or part thereof which was in the 
occupation of a Bharatia as a tenant under a thika  tenant 
ceases to exist except under an order of a court under section 
18A of the West Bengal Premises Tenancy Act, 1956, the thika  
tenant shall reconstruct similar accommodation and restore 
possession to the Bharatia and put the Bharatia in possession 
of such accommodation within one month of such structure 
ceasing to exist, failing which the Bharatia may make an 
application to the Controller in the prescribed manner. 
	(3)	On an application made by the Bharatia under 
sub-section (2), the Controller shall, after giving the thika  tenant 
and the Bharatia  an opportunity of being heard, direct the thika  
tenant to reconstruct similar accommodation and restore 
possession to the Bharatia  within such time as Controller may 
decide. 
</p><p id="p_44">	(4)	If the thika  tenant fails to comply with the orders 
of the Controller under sub-section (3), the Bharatia shall be 
entitled to reconstruct the structure and, for that purpose, may 
make an application to the Controller who shall, after giving the 
Bharatia  and the thika  tenant an opportunity of being heard, 
approve such cost of reconstruction as may appear to him to be 
fair and reasonable and, after such reconstruction, allow 
adjustment of the cost of such reconstruction from the rent 
payable by the Bharatia  in such monthly instalments as the 
Controller may think fit. 
</p><p id="p_45">	(5)	If there is any unlawful resistance by or on behalf 
of the thika  tenant to the reconstruction by the Bharatia  under 
sub-section (4), the Officer-in-charge of the local police station 
shall, on receipt of any requisition of the Controller in writing in 
this behalf, render all necessary and lawful assistance to the 
Bharatia . 
</p><p id="p_46">19.  Proceedings including appeals and proceedings in 
execution of orders, etc. to abate .  All proceedings 
including appeals and all proceedings in execution of orders 
passed in proceedings including appeals under the Calcutta 
Thika   Tenancy Act, 1949, pending on the 19th day of July, 
1978, for the ejectment of thika  tenants and Bharatias shall 
stand abated with effect from the 19th day of July, 1978, as if 
such proceedings, appeals or execution proceedings had never 
been made."
</p>
<p id="p_47">	In view of the aforesaid provisions, now the question to be examined is 
as to whether in the present case, the earlier suits for ejectment filed by the 
thika  tenants for ejectment of Bharatias abated under <a href="/doc/739245/" id="a_49">Section 19</a> of the 1981 
Act?  Under 1949 Act, procedure was provided for ejectment of a thika  tenant 
only and no procedure whatsoever was prescribed for ejectment of a Bharatia 
by a thika tenant.  Therefore, a suit for ejectment could be filed by a thika 
tenant for ejectment of a Bharatia before an ordinary civil court and such 
Bharatia during the continuance of 1949 Act was not entitled to claim 
protection under the Premises Tenancy Act and could be evicted upon 
determination of his tenancy by giving a notice under <a href="/doc/80042/" id="a_50">Section 106</a> of the 
Transfer of Property Act.  Under 1981 Act, it has been specifically provided 
that Bharatias are entitled to claim protection of the Premises Tenancy Act 
meaning thereby that now they cannot be evicted unless grounds for eviction 
enumerated under the Premises Tenancy Act are proved and they cannot be 
ejected merely upon determining their tenancy by giving a notice under 
<a href="/doc/80042/" id="a_51">Section 106</a> of the Transfer of Property Act. 
</p><p id="p_48">	<a href="/doc/1288796/" id="a_52">Section 9</a> of the 1981 Act specifically lays down that from the date of 
coming into force of 1981 Act, i.e., 18th January, 1982, the tenancies of 
Bharatias shall be governed by the Premises Tenancy Act.  On that date, both 
the suits earlier filed by the thika tenants for ejectment of Bharatias were 
pending and when the same were filed, it was not required of the thika tenant 
to prove the grounds for eviction enumerated under the Premises Tenancy 
Act, but with effect from 18th January, 1982 even in those suits a thika tenant 
was required to prove grounds for ejectment under the Premises Tenancy Act 
in case it is held that the same did not abate. 
</p><p id="p_49">	Learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the appellants has 
placed reliance upon three decisions of Calcutta High Court in the case of 
<a href="/doc/948508/" id="a_53">Ranjit Kumar Saha v. Sudhir Kumar Dey</a>  91 Calcutta Weekly Notes 1071, 
<a href="/doc/948508/" id="a_54">Ranjit Kumar Saha v. Sudhir Kumar Dey</a>  91 Calcutta Weekly Notes 1090 
and <a href="/doc/773366/" id="a_55">Mrs. Qaiser Jahan v. Mohammad Yawoob</a> 1982 (2) Calcutta Law 
Journal 143.  In these three decisions, it has been laid down that the 
provisions of <a href="/doc/739245/" id="a_56">Section 19</a> of the 1981 Act shall apply only in relation to those 
suits for eviction which were  filed before the Controller under the provisions of 
1949 Act and were pending on the date of commencement of 1981 Act.  It was 
further laid down therein that the said provisions shall have no application to 
the suits for ejectment filed before the civil court by a thika  tenant for 
ejectment of a Bharatia and pending on the date of commencement of 1981 
Act.  In none of these three cases, the provisions of <a href="/doc/1288796/" id="a_57">Sections 9</a> and <a href="/doc/1454833/" id="a_58">11</a> of the 
1981 Act have been considered.  In case it is held that such suits would not 
come within the mischief of <a href="/doc/739245/" id="a_59">Section 19</a> of the 1981 Act, the provisions of 
<a href="/doc/1288796/" id="a_60">Section 9</a> of the 1981 Act would not apply to it although expressly <a href="/doc/1288796/" id="a_61">Section 9</a> 
provides that from the date of commencement of 1981 Act, i.e., 18th January, 
1982, the provisions of the Premises Tenancy Act would apply to Bharatias.   
Such suits cannot be effectively disposed of after the commencement of 1981 
Act as earlier it was not necessary to prove the grounds for eviction 
enumerated under the Premises Tenancy Act and the Bharatia would be 
thereby denied the protection granted to him under the Premises Tenancy Act 
although he was entitled to such protection even in pending suits.  This being 
the position, we are clearly of the view that suits for ejectment filed by the thika 
tenants for ejectment of Bharatias which were pending before a civil court 
abated under <a href="/doc/739245/" id="a_62">Section 19</a> of the 1981 Act, as such High Court was quite 
justified in holding that the present suits were maintainable. 
	Learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the appellants next 
submitted that the High Court was not justified in reversing the finding of fact  
recorded by the lower appellate court that plaintiffs failed to prove the bona 
fide necessity in relation to one room.  In this regard, it may be stated that from 
the judgment of the High Court, it would appear that the lower appellate court 
affirmed finding of the trial court in relation to personal necessity of the 
plaintiffs with regard to three rooms which finding was assailed by the 
defendants before the High Court.  The building is one in which eviction was 
sought by the plaintiffs from four rooms and evidence is also common.   While 
considering correctness of finding of the lower appellate court in relation to 
three rooms, High Court came to the conclusion that the plaintiffs were having 
only two rooms and they required in all seven rooms, meaning thereby that 
they required five more rooms and in those circumstances, it was held that the 
plaintiffs succeeded in proving their case in relation to bona fide necessity with 
regard to all the four rooms, including one room for which eviction was refused 
by the lower appellate court.  In view of the aforesaid facts, we are not inclined 
to interfere with the impugned judgment rendered by the High Court even with 
regard to eviction of the defendants from one room, in the exercise of powers 
of this Court under <a href="/doc/427855/" id="a_63">Article 136</a> of the Constitution of India. 
	In the result, the appeals fail and the same are dismissed but in the 
circumstances of the case, we direct that there shall be no order as to costs.
