5/11.12.2009</pre><p id="p_1">           This appeal has been preferred against the order dated 28.4.2009

       passed by the learned Single Judge in CWJC No.4238/2000, by which the writ

       petition filed by the petitioner/appellant herein claiming salary of the higher post

       on which he had officiated continuously for a long period was dismissed.

       However,    the     learned   Single    Judge    was    pleased   to   hold   that   the

       petitioner/appellant herein will be entitled to 20% higher salary of the officiating

       post as he had discharged duties on the said post and hence, 20% higher salary

       was held     payable to him as per Rule 103 of the Service Code.                     The

       petitioner/appellant was, therefore, granted liberty to move the authorities

       claiming the said amount.
</p>
<p id="p_2">                       This appeal has been preferred against the aforesaid order on the

       plea that payment of 20% higher salary alone is not enough since the petitioner/

       appellant should have been permitted to claim the entire salary of the post on

       which he discharged duties on an officiating basis.

</p><p id="p_3">                       But we find no substance in the aforesaid contention in view of Rule

       103 of the Service Code which permits payment of only 20% higher salary for

       the officiating post. As long as Rule 103 exists in the Statute Book, the claim of
       the appellant for payment of the entire salary for the officiating post cannot be

      entertained.
</p>
<p id="p_4">                     Thus, we find no substance in this appeal. Hence it is dismissed. It

      goes without saying that 20% higher salary of the officiating post shall be paid to

      the appellant expeditiously but not later than a period of two months from the

      date of receipt of a copy of this order.
