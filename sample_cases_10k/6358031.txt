    BEFORE:
    The Hon'ble JUSTICE ASHIS KUMAR CHAKRABORTY
    Date : 15th January, 2018.



                                             For Petitioner : Ms. Aparna Banerjee with
                                                                 Mr. K.K. Pande, Advs.



      This is an application under <a href="/doc/1120409/" id="a_1">Section 9</a> of the Arbitration &amp; <a href="/doc/1306164/" id="a_2">Conciliation Act</a>, 1996

as amended by the Act 3 of 1996 (in short 'the Act of 1996').

      None appears on behalf of any of the respondents to oppose this application.</pre>

<p id="p_1">      From the affidavit of service filed on behalf of the petitioner, it appears that the

copies of this application were forwarded to both the respondents by Speed Post with

Acknowledgement Due. But the postal authority has returned the envelops with a

common remark that the respondents have refused to accept the copies of the said

application.
</p>
<p id="p_2">      Let the affidavit of service be kept with the record.
</p>
<p id="p_3">      Since the respondents have refused to accept the copies of this application, this

Court has no option but to take up the application for hearing in the absence of the

respondents.
</p>
<p id="p_4">      It is the case of the petitioner that in terms of the agreement dated February 24,

2017 (hereinafter referred to as 'the said agreement') the respondent no.1 obtained a

loan of Rs.17,62,500/- and acquired a Backhoe Loader mentioned in paragraph 3 of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                                2</span>


application. The said Backhoe Loader remains hypothecated in favour of the petitioner.

The respondent no.2 is the guarantor and is a party to the said agreement which also

contains an arbitration clause.
</p>
<p id="p_5">         Under the said agreement, the respondent no.1 was obliged to repay the amount

financed by the petitioner togetherwith the agreed rate of interest and other charges by

way of 47 instalments of Rs.49,950/- each, but after paying the first and part of the

second instalments, he failed to pay the balance instalments. In spite of being called

upon by the petitioner, the respondents failed to repay the dues of the petitioner or to

make over possession of the hypothecated asset to the petitioner. Therefore, the

petitioner has terminated the said agreement and filed this application to enforce its

rights against the hypothecated asset.
</p>
<p id="p_6">         According to the petitioner, as on the date of filing of this application, there

remains an amount of Rs.23,15,307/- due and owing by the respondents to the

petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_7">         The supplementary affidavit filed by the petitioner discloses the present location of

the hypothecated asset is at Kushi Nagar in the state of Uttar Pradesh. Let the

supplementary affidavit be kept on record.
</p>
<p id="p_8">         Having considered the materials on record, I find that the petitioner has made out

a prima facie case and the balance of convenience also lies in favour of the petitioner for

obtaining an order for appointment of a Receiver to take possession of the hypothecated

asset.
</p>
<p id="p_9">         Accordingly, Mr. Bipin Ghosh, Advocate of Bar Association Room No.16, is

appointed as the Receiver with a direction upon him to take actual physical possession

of the hypothecated asset. After taking possession of the hypothecated asset, the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                                      3</span>


Receiver shall keep the same, in his custody, at a safe place to be provided by the

petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_10">              The Receiver shall be paid an initial remuneration of 1500 GMs by the petitioner.

The petitioner shall also bear the travelling expenses of the Receiver and shall provide

him a befitting accommodation at the relevant places in the State of Uttar Pradesh.

Needless to mention that a competent officer of the petitioner shall all along accompany

the Receiver in the State of Uttar Pradesh.
</p>
<p id="p_11">              If necessary, the Receiver shall approach the Superintendent of Police of the

concerned District for obtaining police assistance to implement this order. If the

petitioner deposits the requisite fees with the concerned authorities, the Superintendent

of Police of the concerned district shall render necessary police assistance to the Receiver

to take actual physical possession of the hypothecated asset from the concerned

respondent.
</p>
<p id="p_12">              Let this application appear after four weeks from date.

              The Receiver shall file his report on the next date of hearing.

              Urgent photostat certified copy of this order, if applied for, be made available to

the parties subject to compliance with the requisite formalities.

</p><p id="p_13">              All parties, including the Receiver and the concerned police authorities shall act

on the copy of the photostat certified copy of this order.




</p><p id="p_14">                                                 (ASHIS KUMAR CHAKRABORTY, J.)
