      THIS MISCELLANEOUS FIRST APPEAL IS FILED
UNDER SECTION 173(1) OF MOTOR VEHICLES ACT,
AGAINST THE JUDGMENT AND AWARD DATED
13.06.2011 PASSED IN MVC NO.71/2010 ON THE FILE OF
MOTOR ACCIDENT CLAIMS TRIBUNAL NO.II AT BIJAPUR,
PARTLY ALLOWING THE CLAIM PETITION AND SEEKING
ENHANCEMENT OF COMPENSATION.

     THIS MISCELLANEOUS FIRST APPEAL COMING ON
FOR ADMISSION THIS DAY, THE COURT DELIVERED THE
FOLLOWING:
                          JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">      The    appellant       is       the    claimant         in   MVC

No.71/2010 on the file of the Motor Accident Claims

Tribunal No.II, Bijapur.          He has filed the said claim

petition    seeking      compensation             for   the    injuries

sustained by him in a motor vehicle accident occurred

on 12.11.2009.        The Court below has awarded total

compensation of Rs.7,80,000/- with interest at 6% per

annum on the said amount from the date of the

petition till realization.        The claimant has filed this

appeal seeking enhancement of compensation.


</p><p id="p_2">      2.     Learned counsel for the appellant would

contend     that   the    claimant          had     sustained      50%

disability to the whole body. He was an agriculturist

and earning more than Rs.15,000/- per month.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                  3</span>


However, the Tribunal has taken his income at

Rs.40,000/-        per   annum        for     the     purpose       of

computation of loss of future income. It is argued that

having regard to the nature of injuries sustained by

the claimant, the compensation awarded towards pain

and suffering is on the lower side. He has spent more

than   Rs.3,50,000/-         towards        medical        expenses.

However,     the     Court    below         has     only    awarded

Rs.3,00,000/- under this head.              It is further argued

that   the    Court      below       has    not     awarded        any

compensation towards loss of amenities, conveyance,

nourishment etc.         As per the Doctor's certificate

produced along with the application I.A.No.1/2012, the

claimant     requires     Rs.2,50,000/-           towards     future

medical expenses.        The Tribunal has only awarded

Rs.1,00,000/-       under    this     head.         He     prays   for

reassessment of the compensation payable to the

claimant.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                            4</span><p id="p_3">


</p><p id="p_4">     3.    On the other hand, learned counsel for

respondent No.2-Insurance Company has sought to

justify the impugned judgment and award.

</p><p id="p_5">     4.    I have carefully considered the arguments

of the learned counsel made at the Bar and perused

the material placed on record.
</p>
<p id="p_6">
</p><p id="p_7">     5.    There is no dispute as to the occurrence of

the accident and the liability of respondent No.2-

Insurance Company to pay the compensation. The only

question    for   consideration    is   whether    the

compensation awarded by the Tribunal is adequate?


</p><p id="p_8">     6.    The Doctor in his evidence has stated that

the claimant has sustained 50% disability to the whole

body. The accident had occurred on 12.11.2009. It is

clear from the evidence on record that the claimant

was an agriculturist.   Having regard to the materials

on record, I am of the view that the Court below ought

to have taken his income at Rs.4,500/- per month. He

was aged about 37 years and the multiplier applicable
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                             5</span>


to this case is 15.   Taking his income at Rs.4,500/-

with the application of multiplier 15 and taking 50%

disability to the whole body, the claimant is entitled for

(4,500x12x15x50%/100)= Rs.4,05,000/- towards loss

of future income.
</p>
<p id="p_9">     7.    The claimant has submitted the bills for

Rs.3,50,000/-. It is clear from the evidence on record

that he was hospitalized for 55 days and was operated

for eight times. I am of the view that the Court below

ought to have awarded a sum of Rs.3,50,000/-

towards medical expenses instead of Rs.3,00,000/-.


</p><p id="p_10">     8.    Having regard to the injury sustained by

the claimant, it is just and proper to award a sum of

Rs.1,00,000/- each towards pain and suffering and

loss of amenities. He is also entitled for Rs.25,000/-

towards diet, nutrition and other travelling expenses

and a sum of (4,500x6) Rs.27,000/- towards loss of

income during the laid up period.
</p>
<p id="p_11">     9.    As    noticed   above,   the   claimant    has

produced the certificate of the Doctor along with the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                  6</span>


application I.A.No.1/2012. It is evident from the said

certificate that he requires Rs.2,50,000/- towards

future medical expenses. The Tribunal has awarded a

sum of Rs.1,00,000/-. I am of the view that it is just

and proper to award a sum of Rs.2,50,000/- under

this   head.     Thus,     the       claimant   is    entitled   for

compensation as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">       Loss of future income             Rs. 4,05,000/-

</blockquote><pre id="pre_2">       Pain and suffering                Rs. 1,00,000/-

       Loss of amenities                 Rs. 1,00,000/-

       Loss of income during laid
       up period                  Rs.            27,000/-

       Future medical expenses           Rs. 2,50,000/-

       Diet, nutrition, travelling
       etc                               Rs.         25,000/-

       Medical expenses                  Rs. 3,50,000/-
                                         ________________

             Total                       Rs. 12,57,000/-



</pre><p id="p_12">       10.   The Tribunal has awarded compensation of

Rs.7,80,000/-, which has to be deducted from the

aforesaid amount. Thus, the claimant is entitled for an
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                              7</span>


additional sum of Rs.4,77,000/-.        The aforesaid sum

shall carry interest at the rate of 6% p.a. from the date

of application till the date of deposit.


</p><p id="p_13">      11.   In the result, the appeal succeeds and is

allowed in part. Respondent No.2-Insurance Company

is    directed    to    deposit     a      sum    sum   of

Rs.4,77,000/- towards compensation with interest at

6% p.a. from the date of application till the date of

deposit within eight weeks from the date of receipt of

copy of this order.      The claimant is permitted to

withdraw the said amount on its deposit. No cost.
