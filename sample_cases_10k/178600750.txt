HIGH COURT ACT PRAYING TO SET ASIDE THE ORDER
PASSED IN WRIT PETITION NO. 5251/2012 (LA-RES) DATED
4/3/2013.

       THIS   APPEAL      COMING     ON     FOR    PRELIMINARY
HEARING THIS DAY, CHIEF JUSTICE DELIVERED THE
FOLLOWING:


                       JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">D.H.WAGHELA, CJ (ORAL) :
</p>
<p id="p_2">1.     The    appellant    has   called   into    question    the

elaborate order dated 4.3.2013 of learned Single Judge

in Writ Petition No. 5251/2012 whereby the appellant's

petition has been dismissed.         The undisputed facts of

the case of the appellant are that, he is holding land

bearing Sy.No. 54/2 of Agrahara Koratagere Taluk,

Tumkur District, which he had purchased on 1.1.1979

and trees were stated to have been grown thereon.

When a road was formed by the Karnataka State

Highways Improvement Project ('KSHIP' for short) in the

year   2008,     surveys    were     made    and     the     State

Government had issued on 19.10.2011 a notification

under Section 15 of the Karnataka Highways Act, 1964

(for short 'the Act'), whereby the petitioner stood to lose 1
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                             : 3 :</span>




acre 20 guntas of the land belonging to him. Thereafter,

a notification under Sections 17(1) and 17(2) of the Act

was published on 21.1.2012 and a notice under Section

17(3) of the Act was also issued on 18.1.2012, calling

upon     the   petitioner   to      produce   documents   to

substantiate his claim over the property for the purpose

of awarding compensation.
</p>
<p id="p_3">
</p><p id="p_4">2.     The appellant herein approached this court under

Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution mainly on the

grounds that he was denied an opportunity of being

heard before his land being acquired for the purpose of

public road and the provisions of Sections 15 and 17 of

the Act were unconstitutional for violation of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1">Article

300A</a> of the Constitution because of lack of provision for

an opportunity of being heard to the persons standing to

lose their lands on account of the acquisition.


</p><p id="p_5">3.     Both the contentions as well as the factual

controversy sought to be raised by the appellant have

been elaborately dealt with in the impugned judgment.

It is noted that the primary contention of the appellant

that the provisions of the Act did not provide for an
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                           : 4 :</span>




opportunity of hearing is not wholly correct, insofar as

notice under Section 15 of the Act was issued to all the

owners of the lands which were proposed to be acquired

for upgradation of the highway between Tumkur and

Koratagere. Similarly, a notice under Section 17(3) was

issued to the petitioner and subsequently, a further

notice dated 23.5.2012 was also issued indicating that a

spot inspection would be conducted on 30.5.2012 and

his participation was sought.     The petitioner has not

responded to the notice and the inspection of the

property was conducted without his participation. As for

the legal submission about constitutional validity of the

provisions of Section 15 of the Act, the impugned order

relied upon the settled legal position laid down in State

of Andhra Pradesh Vs. McDowell [(1996)3 SCC 709] and

in Public Service Tribunal Vs. State of Uttar Pradesh

[(2003)4 SCC 104].
</p>
<p id="p_6">
</p><p id="p_7">4.    It was, however, vehemently argued and reiterated

by learned counsel for the appellant that even in the

absence of an express provision for an opportunity of

hearing, the court was required to read such provision in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                            : 5 :</span>




view of the fact that the right to property was protected

by another constitutional provision contained in <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_2">Article

300A</a>   and    the   appellant   stood   to   suffer   adverse

consequences on account of compulsory acquisition of a

part of his land.
</p>
<p id="p_8">
</p><p id="p_9">5.     The statutory scheme of the Act and the express

provisions of Section 15 have to be reviewed for

appreciating the issue sought to be raised in this appeal.

The Karnataka Highways Act, 1964 is, according to its

preamble, made to provide for restriction of ribbon

development along highways, for the prevention and

removal of encroachment thereon, for the construction,

maintenance and development of highways, for the levy

of betterment charges and for certain other matters.      By

Section 2(i), 'highway' is defined to mean any road or

way over which the public have a right of way or are

granted access and which is declared to be a highway

under Section 3; and the expression includes any land

acquired or demarcated with a view to construct a

highway along it. The provisions of Section 15 may be

reproduced as under:
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                              : 6 :</span><p id="p_10">




</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">     "15. Acquisition of land or right or interest
     in land: If at any time on the application of
     the Highway Authority, the State Government
     is satisfied that any land required for the
     purposes of a highway or any right or interest
     of any person in any land required for the
     said    purposes   should       be   compulsorily
     acquired or extinguished, as the case may be,
     it shall be lawful for the State Government to
     publish a notification to that effect in the
     official Gazette. Such notification shall also
     be published in such other manner as may
     be prescribed. A notification so published
     shall be deemed to be the declaration that
     the land is needed or, as the case may be, the
     right   or   interest     is    required   to   be
     extinguished for the purposes of the highway;
     and such declaration shall be conclusive that
     the land is so needed, or the right or interest
     is so required to be extinguished."</blockquote><p id="p_11">

</p><p id="p_12">     The above provision clearly marks a departure from

the scheme of the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_3">Land Acquisition Act</a>, 1894 insofar as

the provisions analogous to the provisions of <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_4">Sections 4</a>,

<a href="/doc/66420479/" id="a_5">5</a>, <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_6">5A</a> and <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_7">6</a> of the Land Acquisition Act are not

incorporated in the Act, and the opportunity of hearing

is excluded by necessary implication.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                              : 7 :</span>




</p><p id="p_13">6.    In view of the law settled by the Apex Court in

State of Andhra Pradesh Vs. McDowell, supra, a law

made by the Parliament or the Legislature can be struck

down by courts on two grounds and two grounds alone

viz., (i) lack of legislative competence and (ii) violation of

fundamental     rights    guaranteed      in   Part-III   of   the

Constitution   or   any    other     constitutional   provision.

There is no third ground.
</p>
<p id="p_14">
</p><p id="p_15">7.    Earlier in Union of India Vs. Tulsiram Patel [(1985)3

SCC 398], the observations in Union of India Vs. Col.

J.N.Sinha [(1970)2 SCC 458] were quoted with the

following relevant observations: "It is true that if a

statutory provision can be read consistently with the

principles of natural justice, the court should do so

because it must be presumed that the Legislatures and

the statutory authorities intend to act in accordance

with the principles of natural justice. But if on the other

hand a statutory provision either specifically or by

necessary implication excludes the application of any or

all the principles of natural justice then the court cannot

ignore the mandate of the legislature or the statutory
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                               : 8 :</span>




authority and read into the concerned provision the

principles of natural justice.        Whether the exercise of a

power conferred should be made in accordance with any

of the principles of natural justice or not depends upon

the express words of the provision conferring the power,

the nature of the power conferred, the purpose for which

it is conferred and the effect of the exercise of that

power."
</p>
<p id="p_16">     After reference to the above observations, the

Constitution Bench went on to observe in paragraph-101

as under:
</p>
<p id="p_17">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">     "101. ..........So far as the audi alteram partem
     rule is concerned, both in England and in
     India, it is well established that where a right
     to a prior notice and an opportunity to be
     heard before an order is passed would
     obstruct the taking of prompt action, such a
     right can be excluded. This right can also be
     excluded where the nature of the action to be
     taken, its object and purpose and the scheme
     of the relevant statutory provisions warrant
     its exclusion; nor can the audi alteram
     partem rule be invoked if importing it would
     have     the    effect      of      paralyzing   the
     administrative process or where the need for
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                 : 9 :</span>




        promptitude or the urgency of taking action
        so demands, as pointed out in Maneka
        Gandhi case at page 681. ............."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_18">8.      Having regard to the scheme of the Act where the

Highways Authority is constituted with statutory powers

and duties and, on its application and satisfaction of the

State Government the requirement of any land for the

purposes of a highway is deemed to be conclusive, the

action of acquisition of lands appears to have been

placed on a higher pedestal, and importing therein the

rule of audi alteram partem would have the effect of

paralyzing the construction and maintenance of public

roads    and   of   defeating     the   purpose   of   the   Act.

Therefore, both literal and purposive interpretation of

<a href="/doc/1235658/" id="a_8">Section 15</a> of the Act require that the provision is not

subjected to reading down and the principles of natural

justice are not required to be read as a part of fair

procedure, as urged on behalf of the appellant.


</p><p id="p_19">9.      Since no other issue is raised in the appeal and the

appellant has failed to make out any ground to interfere

with the impugned order, the appeal is not required to

be entertained and accordingly it is summarily dismissed
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                          : 10 :</span>




along with the applications made therein, with no order

as to costs.
