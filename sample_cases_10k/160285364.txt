<div class="doc_title">Jeetu @ Jitendra vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh Thr on 18 December, 2017</div><pre id="pre_1">                         Cr.A. No.5231/2017
                    Jitu alias Jitendra vs. State of M.P.

Gwalior, Dated : 18.12.2017
         Shri   Rajmani   Bansal,    learned    counsel,    for   the
appellant.
         Shri Shiraz Quraishi, learned Public Prosecutor, for
the respondent/State.
         Respondent No.2/prosecutrix had appeared before
this Court with her father on 24.11.2017 in the case.
However, today at the time of hearing of this appeal,
neither she nor her counsel is found present before this
Court.
         With the consent of learned counsel for the parties
present, the appeal is heard finally at the motion stage
and the following order is passed:-

                              ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">1.       The appellant has filed this appeal under Section
14(A) (2) of the Scheduled Castes and the <a href="/doc/25085007/" id="a_1">Scheduled
Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act</a>, 1989 (for short 'the
Act').
</p><p id="p_2">2.       The short facts of the case for adjudication of this
appeal are that on 10.9.2017, the minor prosecutrix, who
is respondent no.2 herein, made an oral FIR at Police
Station Panihar district Gwalior stating that she is a
member of scheduled caste, and she is pursuing her
studies. On 5.9.2017 at noon, she was going from her
residence located in village Par to village Banwar for
attending the coaching classes on a bicycle. On the way,
appellant Jitu alias Jitendra and co-accused Deshraj forced
                      Cr.A. No.5231/2017
                Jitu alias <a href="/doc/8354942/" id="a_2">Jitendra vs. State of M.P</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_3">her to sit on their motorcycle. They took her in a house
located at Chandrabadani Naka Gwalior. There, appellant
Jitu had raped her with the connivance of co-accused
Deshraj. Two hours later,     they brought her at Railway
Station Dabra on the motorcycle. There, the appellant's
younger brother Narayan met her and told her to marry
with the appellant, otherwise he would kill her. Thereafter,
they took her to village Fathepur where the appellant's
sister/co-accused Sunita resides. On the next day, they
dropped her at Dabra railway station, saying that if she
narrates the incident to anybody they would kill her.       On
account of fear, she did not report the incident to her
parents. On 9.9.2017, she narrated the incident to her
Mausa and Mausi. They conveyed the incident to her
parents. Upon the oral report of the prosecutrix, the police
recorded the FIR and registered a case at Crime No.93 of
2017 against the appellant and the aforestated co-accused
persons for the offences punishable under <a href="/doc/619940/" id="a_3">Sections 363</a>,
<a href="/doc/796352/" id="a_4">366</a>, <a href="/doc/1279834/" id="a_5">376</a>, <a href="/doc/180217/" id="a_6">506</a>, <a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_7">34</a> and <a href="/doc/1897847/" id="a_8">120-B</a> of the I.P.C, 6 r.w 17 of the
POCSO Act, 3 (1)(w) and 3 (2) (va) of the Act.
</p><p id="p_4">3.   The appellant filed the bail application under <a href="/doc/1290514/" id="a_9">Section
439</a> Cr.P.C before the Special Judge (Atrocities), Gwalior.
The learned Special Judge dismissed his bail application
vide order dated 10.11.2017 on the ground that serious
allegations are levelled against him. Hence, this appeal.
</p><p id="p_5">4.   Learned counsel for the appellant submits that the
appellant has been in custody in the case since 29.9.2017
and that the charge sheet had been filed. He submits that
as per the FIR the date of incident is 5.9.2017 whereas the
                       Cr.A. No.5231/2017
                 Jitu alias <a href="/doc/8354942/" id="a_10">Jitendra vs. State of M.P</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_6">prosecutrix lodged the FIR on 10.9.2017. Thus, there is a
delay of 5 days in the lodgment of FIR for which no
satisfactory explanation is offered by the prosecutrix. After
referring to her medico-legal examination report, he
submits that her hymen was old ruptured meaning thereby
she is habituated to sexual intercourse. He submits that as
per the said report, the examining lady doctor has not
found any sign of violence on her body much less on her
genitals. He submits that as per the material on record,
the date of birth of the prosecutrix is 10.11.99. Therefore,
on the date of incident the age of the prosecutrix was 17
years 9 months and 25 days. This means that she is just
short of two months and a few days to attend the majority.
In view of the aforesaid facts and evidence on record, he
submits that the prosecutrix is prima facie a consenting
party in the case and it is highly probable that she lodged
the report under the pressure of her parents and other
relatives. He submits that the appellant is a permanent
resident of the place of occurrence and that he has no
criminal antecedents. He submits that co-accused Deshraj
and Narayan have been granted regular bail by this Court.
Upon these submissions, he prays to allow the appeal by
setting-aside the impugned order of rejection for grant of
bail to the appellant.
</p><p id="p_7">5.   Learned Public Prosecutor has opposed the prayer
and supported the impugned order of rejection for grant of
bail to the appellant.
</p><p id="p_8">6.   Taking into consideration the facts and circumstances
of the case, the submissions raised on behalf of the parties
                       Cr.A. No.5231/2017
                 Jitu alias <a href="/doc/8354942/" id="a_11">Jitendra vs. State of M.P</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_9">by their counsel, the age of the prosecutrix, but without
expressing any opinion on merits of the case, I am of the
view that the appellant deserves to be admitted on bail.
Hence, the appeal is allowed and the impugned order of
rejection for grant of bail is set aside. The learned Special
Judge (Atrocities) Gwalior is directed to release the
appellant on bail upon his furnishing a personal bond in the
sum of Rs. 40,000/- (Forty thousand) with one solvent
surety of the same amount to his satisfaction for securing
his presence in the course of trial of the case. The
appellant shall abide by the conditions enumerated in
<a href="/doc/25085007/" id="a_12">Section 437</a> (3) of the <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_13">Cr.P.C</a>. In case of bail jump, the trial
court will have power to cancel his bail.
</p><p id="p_10">7.    Accordingly, this appeal is finally disposed of.
</p><p id="p_11">      Certified copy as per rules.
