</p><p id="p_3">      2. The case of the prosecution in brief is as under
that :
</p>
<p id="p_4">     On 26.11.2013 at about 8.45 p.m., the accused No.1

to 5 on Main gate of Jinke Park near Kempambudi Water

Tank Road within the jurisdiction of Kempe Gowda Nagar

Police Station holding deadly weapons like Machu, clubs

and chilli powder packet etc. making preparations for

committing dacoity who would come there. C.W.1 - C.D.

Nagaraj   Sub-Inspector   of    Police   received   credible

information at about 8.45 p.m. when he was in Police

Station in that regard, he and C.W.4 to 8 along with 2

panchas went near the spot and noticed that the accused

No.1 to 5 holding deadly weapons in their hands making

preparations to commit dacoity. So, he and his staff

surrounded the accused and apprehended the accused

No.1 to 3 and it was revealed that accused No.4 and 5 by

name Chandra Babu and Venkatesh escaped leaving behind

clubs in the spot of the offence. On search of accused

No.1 to 3 found that the accused No.1 was having Machu

and accused No.2 having knife and accused No.3 having

Chilli powder packet, then he conducted mahazar in

presence of panchas and seized those weapons and

brought the accused persons and seized articles to the

Police station and registered a case against the accused

persons   in   Crime   No.140/2013    for    the    offences

punishable U/Sec. 399 and 402 R/W Sec. 34 of <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_3">I.P.C</a>. and

and after completion of investigation, C.W.1 submitted

charge sheet to the Court.
</p>
<p id="p_5">
</p><p id="p_6">     3. On receipt of the charge sheet, the learned 24th

ACMM, Bengaluru took cognizance of the offences cited

therein and the prosecution papers were furnished to the

accused as per <a href="/doc/1613898/" id="a_4">Section 207</a> of Cr.P.C. Since the offences

punishable under Sec.399 and 402 R/W Sec. 34 of <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_5">IPC</a>

are exclusively triable by the Court of Sessions, the case

was committed to the Court of Principal City Civil and

Sessions Judge, Bengaluru City, who in turn registered

case in S.C.No.808/2014, and pleased to make over the

case to this Court for disposal in accordance with law.


</p><p id="p_7">     4. After hearing the advocate for accused and the

learned Public Prosecutor for the State, the charge for
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                              6            S.C.No.808/2014</span>




the offence punishable U/Sec. 399 and 402 R/W Sec. 34

of <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_6">IPC</a> was framed, read over and explained to the

accused persons, the accused pleaded not guilty and

claimed for trial.
</p>
<p id="p_8">
</p><p id="p_9">     5. The prosecution in order to establish the guilt of

the accused, examined in all 2 witnesses out of 8

witnesses as P.ws.1 and 2 and through them got marked

Ex.P.1 and signatures Ex.P.1(a) and (b) and M.Os.1 to 5.

Inspite of sufficient opportunity given to the prosecution

and concerned police failed to secure the presence of

rest of witnesses, so the prayer of the prosecution to re-

issue NBW to C.W.1 to 3, 5, 6 and 8 was rejected and

evidence of prosecution was taken as closed. After

closure of prosecution evidence, I examined accused No. 1

to 3 U/Sec. 313 of <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_7">Cr.P.C</a>., so as to enable them to explain

the circumstances appearing against them. Wherein the

accused denied the incriminating evidence appeared in the

prosecution evidence and did not choose to lead any

defence evidence on their behalf.

</p><p id="p_11">     6. Heard the learned Public Prosecutor for the

State and defence Counsel for the accused and perused

the material placed on record.
</p>
<p id="p_12">
</p><p id="p_13">     7. The following points arise for my consideration:

</p><p id="p_14">     1) Whether the prosecution proves beyond
        all reasonable doubt that on 26.11.2013 at
        about 08.45 p.m., accused No.1 to 5 in
        front of Jinke Park situated at
        Kempambudi Water Tank road within the
        jurisdiction of Kempegowda nagar Police
        Station, formed themselves into an
        unlawful assembly with their object of
        committing dacoity of public who would
        come there and making preparations for
        committing dacoity, holding deadly arms
        like Machu, knife, clubs and chilli powder
        packet in their hands and thereby the
        accused committed an offence punishable
        U/s.399, 402 of <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_8">IPC</a>?
</p>
<p id="p_15">      2. What order?
</p>
<p id="p_16">     8. My findings on the above points are as under:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">              Point No.1 : Negative.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">              Point No.2 : As per final order,
                          for the following :
</blockquote><span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                             8             S.C.No.808/2014</span>




<blockquote id="blockquote_3">                        R E A S O N S

</blockquote><p id="p_17">     9. Point No.1 : Out of 2 witnesses examined by the

prosecution, P.W.1 - S. Renuka H.C. 412 and P.W.2

Mohammed Rafi P.C.10042 of Kempegowdanagar Police

Station at relevant point of time who accompanied. C.W.1

at the time of raid and conducting of seizure panchanama

P.W.1 and 2 in their evidence deposed that on 26.11.2013

at about 8.45 p.m., when they were in Police Station C.W.1

took them and C.W.5, 6 and 8 and two panchas C.W.2 and

3 near Kempambudi Water Tank road in Government

Vehicle, by that time, the accused persons were present

and talking with each other to rob the public, then C.W.1

directed all of them to surround the accused and to

apprehend   them. Accordingly,    they   surrounded     the

accused and arrested accused No. 1 to 3. But accused

No.4 and 5 by name Chandra babu and Venkatesh ran away

from the spot. Thereafter, C.W.1 conducted panchanama

between 9.00 p.m. to 11.00 p.m. and seized incriminating

articles like Machu, knife, clubs and chilli powder packet

from the possession of the accused. Then they brought
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                9              S.C.No.808/2014</span>




the accused along with seized articles to the Police

Station where C.W.1 registered a case against the

accused P.W.1 and 2 identified the accused No.1 to 5 as to

they are the persons who were making preparations to

commit dacoity, by that time. They identified Ex.P.1 -

Panchanama    and   their     signatures   Ex.P.1(a)   and      (b)

respectively. From the evidence of P.W.1 and 2, it

apparently appears that their evidence is in accordance

with prosecution case. In their evidence there are number

of discrepancies and infirmities. As per law, I.O. who

conducts pachanama should seize articles covering them

with clothes in the spot of offence itself. P.W.1 and 2

deposed in their cross-examination that it is not

mentioned in the statement as to who arrested which of

the accused persons. P.W.1 admits that the clothes

covered on and M.O.1 to 5 are stitched with sewing

machine but he says that he does not know where those

clothes were stitched. Whereas P.W.2 stated that in the

spot of offence, they stitched clothes M.O.1 to 5 by hand

in the spot of the offence.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                            10            S.C.No.808/2014</span><p id="p_18">




</p><p id="p_19">     10. P.W.2 also stated that he does not know which of

the accused he arrested and which of the staff arrested

which of the accused persons. If at all if this witness

present at the time of raid and panchanama certainly he

could have stated as to which of the accused he caught

hold. In the complaint there is no mention about the

names of the panch witnesses.
</p>
<p id="p_20">

</p><p id="p_21">     11. From the evidence of above witnesses it becomes

clear that their evidence is not in accordance with

evidence of each other. P.W.1 stated that he does not

know who are the panchas and he does not know what the

accused persons were talking with each other. He further

states that the clothes on M.O.1 to 5 were stitched with

sewing machine. But he does not know where the clothes

were stitched. P.W.2 states that the clothes were

stitched by hand. P.W.2 states that he does not know

which of the accused were arrested by whom. So there is

no corroboration in between the evidence of P.W.1 and 2

so their evidence is made unbelievable. In this case, the

most material witnesses like panchas the C.W.2 and C.W.3
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                             11            S.C.No.808/2014</span>




are not examined. The evidence of C.W.2 and C.W.3

panchas is important to prove the identity of the accused

persons, recovery of incriminating articles i.e. weapons

from the possession of the accused, the conducting of

seizure Panchanama in their presence. Apart from that

C.W.1, the investigating officer who conducted raid and

Panchanama is also not examined. So non examination of

these material witnesses has proved fatal to the

prosecution case. Under such circumstances, I am of the

view that in absence of corroborative independent

testimony of material witnesses, the sole evidence of

P.W.1 and 2 who are the police officials, interested in

securing the conviction of the accused is not safe to be

relied upon. Therefore, I am constrained to hold that the

prosecution has utterly failed to prove the guilt of the

accused beyond all reasonable doubts. As such, I answer

the point No.1 raised for my consideration in Negative.


</p><p id="p_22">     12. Point   No.2 : Having regard to my above

observations and findings on point No.1 in negative,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                12              S.C.No.808/2014</span>




extending the benefit of doubt to the accused No.1 to 5,

I proceed to pass the following :
