26/9/2013
      None for the appellant.

      Shri Gulab Sohane, Adv. for the respondent no.2.</pre>

<p id="p_1">      Arguments heard.
</p>
<p id="p_2">      This appeal filed under <a href="/doc/307321/" id="a_1">Section 30</a> of the Workmen's

<a href="/doc/1113485/" id="a_2">Compensation Act</a>, 1923 challenging the award dated 15.2.2011

passed by learned Commissioner, Workmen's <a href="/doc/1113485/" id="a_3">Compensation Act</a> &amp;

Labour Judge, Satna in Claim Case No.23/10 WC Act (non fatal) has

been admitted on the following substantial questions of law vide

orders dated 28.9.2011 &amp; 21.11.2012 respectively :-

</p><p id="p_3">             "1.      Whether       the          Commissioner,
             Workmen's Compensation was justified in
             not awarding the penalty though specific
             contention has been advanced in the
             application filed before him, however the
             appellant is entitled to get compensation
             along with the penalty ?
</p><pre id="pre_2">             2.       Whether       the          Commissioner,
             Workmen's      Compensation          has   rightly
             awarded     the    interest    as    per   Section
</pre><p id="p_4">             4A(3)(a) of Workmen's <a href="/doc/1113485/" id="a_4">Compensation Act</a>,
             1923 ?
</p><p id="p_5">             3.       Whether    the       Commissioner     for
             Workmen Compensation by ignoring the
             material piece of evidence regarding the
               wages which the workmen is drawing
              passed the award on lesser side ?"
</p><p id="p_6">        Cross-objections have been filed on behalf of respondent

no.2 and the appellant has filed an application under Order 41 Rule

27 of CPC for taking on record the certificate dated 20.1.2011 by the

Medical Board mentioning 40% disability to the appellant on the

ground that report of Medical Board came to the knowledge of

appellant on 20.1.2011 when after his evidence his statements were

recorded, therefore, he could not file the disability certificate before

the Commissioner.     The learned Commissioner has computed the

compensation on the ground of 19% permanent disability.

</p><p id="p_7">       Considering the fact that due to injury sustained in the

incidence, the disability of the appellant is 40% while the

Commissioner has awarded compensation by considering the

disability as 19%. Since, the certificate disability has been received

by the appellant after closure of the evidence, therefore, the reason

for delayed filing of disability certificate is sufficient and the

certificate filed by the appellant needs a consideration by computing

compensation. Simultaneously, respondents also deserve the right

of rebuttal with regard to certificate of permanent disability.

</p><p id="p_8">       Therefore, without going into the merits of the case, the

impugned award passed by the learned Commissioner is set aside

and the matter is remanded back to the Commissioner for affording
 opportunity to the appellant/claimant to adduce evidence by

producing certificate granted by the Medical Board, Satna and also to

afford opportunity to the respondents to adduce their defence with

regard to certificate and decide the matter afresh.

</p><p id="p_9">      The appeal is disposed of accordingly.
