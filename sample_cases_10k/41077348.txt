8. The date of such order            :     06.06.2015.


            THE BRIEF REASONS FOR FINAL ORDER:

     The prosecution's case in brief as set out in Cl. No.7 of

charge sheet is that the accused No.1 and 2 having common

intention to commit an offence and in furtherance of such

common intention on 1.2.2013 at about 8.30 p.m. at Harshitha

Hindu Military Hotel, situated at No.5, Muthurayappa Building,

near Mohan Talkies, Hegganhalli Main Road, Sunkadakatte, within

the limits of Kamakshipalya P.S., Bangalore, the accused persons

with regard to have the drinks quarreled with the complainant-

Puttaraju, and further the complainant demanded to pay the

Mutton Bill of Rs.300/-, the accused persons assaulted the
                                  3
                                                  CC No.17752/2013
complainant with the help of beer bottle over the left side of the

cheek, caused bleeding injuries and by showing the said beer

bottle put threat to the life of complainant by saying that when

they came to have the drinks, the complainant should not

question them. Thus, the accused persons have committed the

aforesaid offences as alleged. Hence, the charge sheet.

     2. During Crime stage, the accused persons enlarged on

regular bail. After submission of this charge sheet, this court has

taken cognizance of the aforesaid offences against the aforesaid

accused persons.      Copies of the charge sheet have been

furnished to them as per Sec. 207 of <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_3">Cr.P.C</a>. With no objection

from the Counsel for the Accused, this Court framed charge for

the aforesaid offences against them. The same read over and

explained to them in the language known to them. They pleaded

not guilty. The prosecution has examined the complainant as

PW.1 and it has got marked two documents as Ex.P1 and 2.

Statement of the accused persons has been dispensed since no

incriminating evidence placed against them.
                                  4
                                                   CC No.17752/2013
     3.Heard the arguments of both sides, perused evidence

placed before the court.

     4. The Ex.P1 is the Oral statement of complainant of this

case dtd., 1.2.2013 that recorded by the then ASI of

Kamskhipalya P.S., Bangalore. Ex.P2 is the Mahazar dtd.,

2.2.2013 that prepared by the IO in presence of the complainant

and others in between 9.00 to 9.45 a.m. at Harshitha Military

Hotel, No.5, Building Muthurayappa Building, near Mohan Talkies,

Hegganahalli   Main    Road,   Sunkadakatte,    that   situated   at

Kamakshipalya P.S., limits, Bangalore City.

     5.In the oral statement marked as Ex.P1, the PW.1 has

specifically stated to the IO by reiterating almost all the facts as

averred in the Cl. No. 7 of Charge sheet and para No.1 of this

judgment. Whereas, during the course of his oral evidence, PW.1

has not stated the evidence as stated in the oral statement

marked as Ex.P.1 or in Cl. No. 7 of charge sheet or in para No.1

of this judgment. He has stated that the accused persons neither

assaulted with beer bottle nor put threat to his life as alleged in
                                5
                                                 CC No.17752/2013
Column No.7 of charge sheet. He further deposed before the

Court that he did not know the contents of the document marked

in Ex.P1 and 2. PW-1 has deposed that he did not know that for

when, where and for what reason he put his signature on the

documents that are marked as Ex.P1 and 2.       The evidence of

PW.1 is not in accordance with Ex,P1 Complaint and Ex.P2

Mahazar. PW.1 is treated as an hostile witness at the request of

the prosecution.   He was subjected to cross examination on

behalf of case of the prosecution.     But nothing is elicited in

support of the case of the prosecution in the evidence of PW.1

recorded during the course of his cross-examination.    The said

evidence of PW.1 did not disclose that the accused persons have

committed the offences as alleged against them. Since the

complainant as turned hostile, other witnesses have been

discharged, since no purpose would be survived if they were

examined in view of the judgment of Hon'ble Apex Court that

reported in 1996(3) Crime 85.        Therefore, it would be very

difficult to accept that the accused persons have committed the
                                  6
                                                   CC No.17752/2013
aforesaid offences as alleged. Therefore, I am of opinion that the

prosecution miserably has failed to prove its case as alleged

against the accused persons beyond all reasonable doubt. The

accused persons are entitled to be acquittal.

     6. In view of the aforesaid discussion, this court proceed to

pass the following:-

                             ORDER
