<p id="p_1">                                   The challenge in the present writ petition is for

                    quashing of the minimum criteria of 55% marks in 10+2

                    examination.       The said criteria is to be obtained in physics,

                    mathematics and chemistry in the case of the petitioner. The

                    petitioner is seeking admission in BE-MBA Programme (5

<p id="p_2">                                   The sole argument raised by the petitioner is that as

                    Offering Technical Education By Universities Regulations 2014

                    notified on 28.02.2014, the criteria was fixed for colleges offering

                    technical education at degree level. Reliance is placed upon the

                    norms and requirements under Clause 6.1, whereby the entry level

                    the candidates belonging to the reserve category to which the

                    petitioner belongs and having 52.3% marks would be eligible for

                    admission. On the strength of the said criteria fixed by the UGC,

                    petitioner submits that the criteria in the prospectus could not be

                    over and above the qualifications prescribed.

                    student getting at least 45% marks, which would be the minimum

                    criteria. It is settled principle that the University can always fix

                    higher eligibility than the minimum fixed.

                    Division Bench of this Court reversed the judgment of the learned

                    Single Judge and laid down that the authorities could lay down

                    higher qualifications for the purpose of admission. The relevant

                    portion reads as under:-

<blockquote id="blockquote_2">                                  "We find substance in this argument of the learned
                                  counsel.     It will be seen from Regulation No.3.1
                                  prescribing the qualification for admission to M.Lib., that
                                  these are the minimum qualifications. In other words, the
                                  admission    cannot   be     made   by   prescribing   lower
                                  qualifications than mentioned in Regulation No.3.1.
                                  However, this did not debar the Authorities to lay down
                                  higher qualifications for the purpose of admission.        In
                                  Lavu Narendranath's case (AIR 1971 SC 2560) (supra),
                                  the   Apex   Court    held   that   though   the   minimum
                                  qualification for admission which was prescribed was
                                  50% at the qualifying examination, but this did not debar
                                  the Government which runs the Colleges, the right to
                                  make selection out of large number of candidates and for
                                  this purpose they could prescribe a test of their own
                                  which was not against any law.        The Supreme Court
                                  went on to say that merely because they tried to
                                  supplement the eligibility rule by a written test, the action
                                  could not be impeached. It observed as under:- Para 8)"

                                The Division Bench of this Court in Ajay Malik Vs.

                    Punjab University thorugh its Registrar, Punjab University,

                    Chandigarh and others 1992 AIR (Punjab) 308, upheld the

                    power of the University, whereby 45% of the aggregate marks had

                    been fixed for admission in law course. The argument that the Bar

                    Council had only provided that the minimum qualification required

                    for admission was a Bachelor Degree and therefore the University

                    had no jurisdiction to fix a higher qualification condition was

                    rejected. The relevant portion reads as under:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">                                   "It would be seen that, the power of the Bar Council is
                                   to prescribe only a minimum condition of eligibility for
                                   admission for purposes of recognising a University
                                   degree so that a certain level of legal education could
                                   be maintained but it does not imply that a University to
                                   maintain its own academic standards is prohibited from
                                   raising the minimum qualification as prescribed by the
                                   Bar Council. In other words, if the University prescribes
                                   any condition of eligibility for admission to the law
                                   degree course which is lower than the condition of
                                   eligibility prescribed by the Bar Council, the latter can
                                   refuse to recognise the law degree conferred by the
                                   University for the purpose of enrolment as an Advocate.</blockquote><p id="p_9">
</p><p id="p_10">                                   For instance, the University could prescribe that no
                                   candidate who has secured less than 50% marks in the
                                   Bachelor's degree would be eligible for admission to the
                                   law course. Such a clause in the University Regulations
                                   would not contravene the rules framed by the Bar
                                   Council.   In the present case, the University has
                                   prescribed the condition of 45% of the aggregate marks
                                   in the Bachelor's degree, which is the qualifying

                    Bench of the Apex Court set aside the order of the High Court,

                    wherein on account of the differences in norms fixed by the AICTE

                    and the norms fixed by the State Government directions had been

                    issued and students who had not secured the prescribed minimum

                    marks were allowed to take part in the admission process.

                    Accordingly, it was held that if higher minimum was prescribed by

                    the State Government than what had been prescribed by the

                    AICTE, it could not be said to be in any manner adverse to the

                                   prescribed by the AICTE, can it be said that it is in any
                                   manner adverse to the standards fixed by the AICTE or
                                   reduces the standard fixed by it? In our opinion, it does
                                   not. On the other hand, if we proceed on the basis that
                                   the norms fixed by the AICTE would allow admission
                                   only on the basis of the marks obtained in the qualifying
                                   examination the additional test made applicable is the
                                   common entrance test by the State Government. If we
                                   proceed to take the standard fixed by the AICTE to be
                                   the common entrance test then the prescription made
                                   by the State Government of having obtained certain
                                   marks higher than the minimum in the qualifying
                                   examination in order to be eligible to participate in the
                                   common entrance test is in addition to the common
                                   entrance test. In either event, the streams proposed by
                                   the AICTE are not belittled in any manner. The manner
                                   in which the High Court has proceeded is that what has
                                   been prescribed by the AICTE is inexorable and that
                                   that minimum alone should be taken into consideration
                                   and no other standard could be fixed even the higher
                                   as stated by this Court in Dr. Preeti Srivastava's case. It
                                   is no doubt true as noticed by this Court in Adhiyaman's
                                   case that there may be situations when a large number
                                   of seats may fall vacant on account of the higher
                                   standards fixed. The standards fixed should always be
                                   realistic which are attainable and are within the reach of
                                   the candidates. It cannot be said that the prescriptions
                                   by the State Government in addition to those of AICTE
                                   in the present case are such which are not attainable or
                                   which are not within the reach of the candidates who
                                   seek admission for engineering colleges. It is not very
                                   high percentage of marks that has been prescribed as
                                   minimum of 60% downwards, but definitely higher than
                                   the mere pass marks. Excellence in higher education is
                                   always insisted upon by series of decisions of this
