      THIS WRIT PETITION COMING ON FOR PRELIMINARY
HEARING THIS DAY, THE COURT, MADE THE FOLLOWING:
                                3




                          ORDER
</pre>

<p id="p_1">      Learned Additional Government Advocate is directed

to take notice on behalf of respondent Nos.1 to 7.


</p><p id="p_2">      2.    The petitioner has filed the present petition

seeking for issuance of a writ of mandamus to consider

his   representation   dated       05.02.2018   submitted   by

petitioner No.2 produced as Annexures-G and H.


</p><p id="p_3">      3.    It is the contention of the petitioners that they

are the owners of land bearing Sy. No.49/1+3A of

Bhukodihalli village of Haveri Taluk and that respondent

Nos.4 and 5, while forming a public road, had acquired an

extent of 17 guntas as per their records. It is, however, the

contention of the petitioners that the extent of land that

has been utilized is 26 guntas. The petitioner has

produced Annexure-B which indicates that the extent of

land as regards Sy.No.49/1+3A that had been notified is

17 guntas. As per Annexure-B, it is noticed that the

acquisition is said to have taken place in the year 1970
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                4</span>




and as per notification dated 30th April 1970. It is the

contention of the petitioner that various representations

had been made to the respondents as regards the

utilization of more land than what had been acquired. In

fact, as per Annexure-C, respondent No.3 has stated that

no records are available with respect to the award passed

with respect to the notification dated 30th April 1970.

Similarly, the Department of Public Works, by letter dated

10th July 2017 has also stated that no records are

available with respect to the formation of the road and

taking of possession of the lands for the purpose of

formation of road.
</p>
<p id="p_4">
</p><p id="p_5">      4.    The petitioner has sought for consideration of

his   representation   dated   05.02.2018   made    to   the

Assistant Executive Engineer, Public Works Department,

and to the Assistant Commissioner, Haveri Sub-Division,

Haveri, wherein it is stated that excess of 9 guntas of land

has been acquired for the purpose of formation of road
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                5</span>




and has sought for compensation to the extent of land

acquired that has been additionally utilized.


</p><p id="p_6">        5.    The learned Additional Government Advocate

would contend that the present petition cannot be

considered as it is a stale claim and, in the event there

was     any   dispute   as   regards   the   measurement    as

mentioned in the award, procedure under <a href="/doc/868941/" id="a_1">Section 18(1)</a> of

the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, ought to have been

resorted to and if the acquisition pertains to the year

1970, no direction, at this point of time, can be given to

consider the representations of the petitioner. It is further

submitted that the invocation of the procedure under

<a href="/doc/1517117/" id="a_2">Section 18</a> of the Land Acquisition Act is also barred by

time.
</p>
<p id="p_7">
</p><p id="p_8">        6.    It is noticed that there is no substantial reason

explaining the delay and even otherwise rights for seeking

compensation arising out of the claim that additional land

has been utilized for the purpose of formation of road as

contemplated under <a href="/doc/1517117/" id="a_3">Section 18</a> of the Land Acquisition
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                              6</span>




Act, having been extinguished, entertaining this writ

petition with unexplained laches is not permissible.


</p><p id="p_9">      7.     The parties, who come seeking for relief in

exercise of power under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_4">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of

India, are to be vigilant. Having slept over his rights for

more than 45 years, this Court cannot entertain such

claim of the petitioner. The defence of the State that no

records are available to examine the issue at this point of

time is reasonable considering that the proceedings for

acquisition have already concluded in the year 1970. In

view of the unexplained laches, present petition is

dismissed.
