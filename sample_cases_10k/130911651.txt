                                     BEFORE
                    HON'BLE MRS. JUSTICE RUMI KUMARI PHUKAN
                                             ORDER
</pre><p id="p_1">29-03-2019.
</p><p id="p_2">Heard learned counsel appearing for and on behalf of the petitioner and also the learned counsel for
the respondent.
</p>
<p id="p_3">The petitioner initially filed an FIR before the O.C., Tamulpur P.S., which was registered as the
Tamulpur P.S. Case No.248/2016 and the case ended at F.R. and thereafter on the complaint filed by
                                                                                          Page No.# 2/2

the present petitioner, the C.R. Case No.501/2017 was registered against the accused/respondents
herein and the case is pending before the Court of learned CJM at Mushalpur in Baksa District.
</p>
<p id="p_4">The case is now at the appearance stage. At this stage, the petitioner come forward with the present
petition for transfer of the suit from the Court of Baksa to a Court of competent jurisdiction of
Guwahati, as because she is now resided at Guwahati along with her husband and minor child
although at the time of filing the FIR and complaint, they were at Baksa. The sole ground that has
been raised in the present petition seeking transfer that the petitioner is apprehensive that since the
respondents have criminal antecedent and she being a woman find it unsafe to attend the Court at
different District at this stage and the accused have muscle power. So she feels totally unsecure to
face the trial at Baksa.
</p>
<p id="p_5">I have heard the submission of learned counsel for the petitioner and also the learned counsel for the
respondent who have raised objection for such transfer of the case on the ground that has been
assigned. It is submitted that the husband of the present petitioner, who was alleged injured in the
said case is close relative/nephew of the respondent/accused and he himself has criminal background.
However there is no reason for apprehension of the petitioner to face the trial and such trial will be
obviously held in a Court of law.
</p>
<p id="p_6">On due consideration of the entire matter it reflects that the petitioner herein as the
informant/complainant in the said case and in that case she is also a witness and for the purpose of
giving evidence, she is to appear only for one time before the Court to record her evidence. Unlike the
accused persons, the informant is not required to appear before the Court on each and every date
which may be difficult on the part of a woman having a child. It can be safely construed that for the
purpose of giving evidence to appear before the Court for one day cannot be an extreme difficulty on
the part of the present petitioner so as to seek transfer of a case. Only on the apprehension of the
petitioner/complainant, a case cannot be transferred which is otherwise pending before a Court of
competent jurisdiction and there appears no any prejudice or extreme inconvenience on the part of
the petitioner to appear before the Court, as has been indicated above.
</p>
<p id="p_7">I find no any cogent ground to interfere into the trial of the case and the present transfer petition
stands dismissed.
</p>
