</p><p id="p_3">     The petitioner has approached this court seeking the

following relief :-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">          i.    Issue a writ of mandamus or any other
     appropriate writ, order or direction commanding the
     5th respondent to in concurrence with the second
     respondent to see that the obstruction which are
     caused by respondents 3 and 4, and such similarly
     placed persons are removed by appropriate police
     protection orders being provided in any suitable
     manner in the interest of justice.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">          ii.   Issue a writ of mandamus or any other
     appropriate writ or direction commanding the 5th
     respondent to consider Ext.P2 and to decide upon the
     same in any appropriate manner by acting upon the
     same within such time as may be fixed by this Hon'ble
     court in the interest of justice.
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_3">     2. Briefly put, the case of the petitioner is as follows :-</blockquote><p id="p_4">

</p><p id="p_5">     On the eastern side of the bus stand a hotel is being run

by the petitioner which has got an access to the same.

Originally it was a proper way of the petitioner but the

persons on either sides of the way are using the access.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                              2</span>

When this way was sought to be blocked, he lodged Ext.P1

complaint before the second respondent. But nothing was

done in the matter.      The petitioner was threatened on

several   occasions     and therefore  for  removing   the

obstructions he had submitted a request before the 5th

respondent stating that because of the obstruction caused

there has been several occasions where skirmishes have

taken place between the employees in the hotel and the

persons who come to the hotel with respondents 3 and 4.

The petitioner again lodged a complaint before the 5th

respondent as Ext.P2.      There is grave law and order

situation prevailing at present.
</p>
<p id="p_6">     3.    We have heard the learned counsel for the

petitioner, the learned counsel for the 3rd respondent and

also the learned Government Pleader.          The learned

Government Pleader would point out that in Ext.P2 the

petitioner describes the way as the private way of the

petitioner. The petitioner essentially wants to have a no

parking board placed by the police authorities.          The

petitioner does not show any legal warrant for the same.

The petitioner, if aggrieved, may approach the competent

civil court or any other forum. Without prejudice to the

right of the petitioner, the writ petition is dismissed.
