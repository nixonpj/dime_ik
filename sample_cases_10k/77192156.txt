THE HONOURABLE MR.JUSTICE S.NAGAMUTHU
and
THE HONOURABLE DR.JUSTICE ANITA SUMANTH
									
H.C.P.No.2252 of 2016


Meri								   	              ....  Petitioner

vs.

1. State of Tamil Nadu
    Rep. by the Secretary to the Government,
    Home, Prohibition &amp; Excise Dept.,
    Secretariat, 
    Chennai  600 009.

2. The Commissioner of Police,
    Greater Chennai.				   			  .... Respondents
Prayer : Petition filed under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India praying for issuance of a Writ of Habeas Corpus calling for the entire records connected with the detention passed by the 2nd respondent in                               Memo No.1070/BCDFGISSSV/2016 dated 26.09.2016 and quash the same and direct the respondents to produce the body and person of petitioner's mother namely, Irudhaya Rani, female, aged about 55 years,                             W/o Lt.Arumugam, was detained as a 'Goonda' and lodged in Special Prison for Women, Puzhal, Chennai under the <a href="/doc/195458/" id="a_2">Tamil Nadu Act</a> 14 of 1982  before this  Court and set her at liberty.
		For Petitioner		..  	M/s.S.Senthil Vel
							
		For Respondents		..  	Mr. V.M.R. Rajentren,
							Additional Public Prosecutor
						
					     O R D E R
</pre>
      
<p id="p_1">(The order of the Court was made by S.NAGAMUTHU.,J )

	This Habeas Corpus Petition has been filed by the daughter of the detenuee to issue a Writ of Habeas Corpus to call for the records in connection with the order of detention passed by the second respondent dated 26.09.2016 in Memo No.1070/BCDFGISSSV/2016 against the petitioner's mother namely Irudhaya Rani, female, aged about 55 years,                             W/o Lt.Arumugam, and now confined at Special Prison for Women, Puzhal, Chennai and set aside the same and direct the respondents to produce the body of detenuee before this Hon'ble Court and set her at liberty .
</p>
<p id="p_2">	2. Even though the learned counsel for the petitioner raised many grounds in assailing the impugned order of detention in the petition, he confined his arguments only to the ground of delay in considering the representation of the detenue.  According to the learned counsel for the petitioner, the representation of the detenue, has been received by the Government on 20.10.2016  and remarks have been called for from the detaining authority on 20.10.2016.  However, the remarks have been received by the Government only on 01.11.2016, after a delay of 11 days. He adds that the file was dealt with by the Minister concerned on 24.12.2016 and the rejection letter was communicated to the detenue on 28.12.2016.  It is his further submission that as per the Proforma submitted by the learned Additional Public Prosecutor, there were 21 intervening holidays and there is a delay of 40 days, which remains unexplained. The unexplained delay in considering the representation of the detenue vitiates the detention order. In support of his contention, the learned counsel for the petitioner relied on the judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court in Rajammal Vs. State of Tamil Nadu, reported in (1999) 1 SCC 417.
</p>
<p id="p_3">	3. Resisting the contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner, the learned Additional Public Prosecutor had submitted that the impugned detention order has been passed on cogent and sufficient materials and there is no illegality or infirmity in the impugned order of detention.  The learned  Additional Public Prosecutor had further submitted that there was no deliberate delay on the part of the authorities concerned to consider and dispose of the representation of the detenue.  It is contended that such a delay is not fatal to the impugned detention order, as the authorities concerned are dealing with the file right from the date of receipt of the representation and therefore, he prayed for dismissal of the petition.		
</p><p id="p_4">	4. We have considered the rival submissions carefully with regard to facts and citation and perused the materials available on record.
</p>
<p id="p_5">	5. As per the Proforma submitted by the learned Additional Public Prosecutor, the representation of the detenue was received by the Government on 20.10.2016  and remarks have been called for from the detaining authority on 20.10.2016.  However, remarks have been received by the Government only on 01.11.2016, i.e., after a delay of 11 days and the case of the detenue was dealt with by the Minister concerned on 24.12.2016 and the same was rejected on 28.12.2016.  From the above, it is clear that in between 20.10.2016 and 01.11.2016, [i.e., the intermittent days between the remarks called for and the remarks received] there is a delay of 11 days. There were 21 intervening holidays, but still there is a delay of 40  days, which remain unexplained.
</p>
<p id="p_6">	6.It is trite law that the representation should be very expeditiously considered and disposed of with a sense of urgency and without avoidable delay.  Any unexplained delay in the disposal of the representation would be a breach of the constitutional imperative and it would render the continued detention impermissible and illegal. From the records produced, we find that no acceptable explanation has been offered for the delay of 40 days.  Therefore, we have to hold that the delay has vitiated further detention of the detenue.
</p>
<p id="p_7">	7.In the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Rajammal's case (cited supra), it has been held as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_8">	"It is a constitutional obligation of the Government to consider the representation forwarded by the detenue without any delay.  Though no period is prescribed by <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_3">Article 22</a> of the Constitution for the decision to be taken on the representation, the words "as soon as may be " in clause (5) of <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_4">Article 22</a> convey the message that the representation should be considered and disposed of at the earliest."
</p>	
<p id="p_9">	8. As per the dictum laid down by the Supreme Court in above cited Rajammal's case, number of days of delay is immaterial and what is to be considered is whether the delay caused has been properly explained by the authorities concerned.  But, here 40 days delay has not been properly explained at all.
</p><p id="p_10">	9. Further, in a recent decision in <a href="/doc/134784035/" id="a_5">Ummu Sabeena  vs. State of Kerala</a> - 2011 STPL (Web) 999 SC, the Supreme Court has held that the history of personal liberty, as is well known, is a history of insistence on procedural safeguards. The expression 'as soon as may be', in <a href="/doc/1709581/" id="a_6">Article 22(5)</a> of the Constitution of India clearly shows the concern of the makers of the Constitution that the representation, made on behalf of the detenue, should be considered and disposed of with a sense of urgency and without any avoidable delay. 
</p>
<p id="p_11">	10. In the light of the above fact and law, we have no hesitation in quashing the order of detention on the ground of delay on the part of the Government in disposing of the representation of the detenue.
</p>	
<p id="p_12">	11. Accordingly, the habeas corpus petition is allowed and the detention order dated 26.09.2016, passed by the second respondent is quashed. The detenue is directed to be set at liberty, forthwith, unless her presence is required in connection with any other case.
