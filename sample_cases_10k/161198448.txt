JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">1.      Accused Ramesh was challaned by the police under

<a href="/doc/4266/" id="a_2">section 308</a> of IPC. The challan against the accused was

filed in the court of ld.M.M. New Delhi, who committed the

same to the Court of Sessions vide order dated 4.4.2007.



</p><p id="p_2">2.   The brief facts of the prosecution case are that on on

21.4.2006 on receipt of DD No. 9A, WSI Pratibha Sharma

alongwith Ct. Jagbir Singh reached spot where she came to

know that injured have been shifted to hospital.

Thereafter, she reached Safdur Jung Hospital where she

found injured Vimla admitted there and the doctor

declared her fit for her verbal statement. She gave her

statement to the effect that at about 12 noon, her husband

Ramesh told her to vacate the house as he wanted to give
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                  2</span>

the same on rent and if she will not do so, he will kill. Her

husband Ramesh brought one plash and hit the same on

her head and shoulders several times. She raised alarm,

her daughter in law Pooja came there and saved her. Her

husband Ramesh fled away from the spot.            Upon his

statement, case FIR No. 145/06 was registered. After

completion of investigation, challan was filed in the court.

</p><p id="p_3">3.    After hearing both the parties, charge under <a href="/doc/4266/" id="a_3">Section

308</a> of IPC was framed against accused Ramesh to which

he pleaded not guilty and claimed trial.
</p>
<p id="p_4">4.    In support of its case the prosecution has examined

PW 1 Vimla, the injured. She has stated on oath that on

21.4.2006, in the noon time, her husband accused Ramesh

asked her to vacate the house in which she was living.

Accused Ramesh being her husband was not providing her

money for daily requirements.        When she refused to

vacate the house, accused Ramesh started quarrelling

with her, he abused her. She has further stated that while

running, she fell down on the floor and her head stuck

against the wall due to which she received bleeding

injuries. She was taken to Safdar Jung Hospital.         Her

signatures were obtained by the police on several papers.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                3</span>

She has stated that accused Ramesh had not caused any

injuries on her head.    She was permitted to be cross-

examined by Ld. Addl. PP as she was resiling from her

previous statement but nothing has come out in his cross-

examination. She has specifically denied the suggestion

that accused caused her injury on her head by an iron

plash several times.
</p>
<p id="p_5">5.         PW 2 is Pooja, daughter in law of PW 1 Vimla,

the injured. She has testified that accused Ramesh is her

father in law. One year ago, a quarrel took place between

her mother in law and      accused Ramesh. During this

scuffle, her mother     in law fell down and sustained

injuries. She has stated that she does not know as to what

statement was recorded by the police. She was also cross-

examined by Ld. Addl. PP but nothing has come out in her

cross-examination.
</p>
<p id="p_6">6.         From the perusal of the record, it is clear that

the star witness in this case is PW 1 Smt. Vimla, the

injured. She has not supported the case of the prosecution

and has categorically stated that her husband accused

Ramesh had not caused her injuries. The eye witnesss of

the incident was Pooja, daguther in law of accused who has
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                  4</span>

been examined as PW 2 who has categorically supported

the version of PW 1 that accused had not caused any injury

upon the person of PW 1. These were the witnesses on

whom the version of the prosecution was hinged. They

have not supported the case of the prosecution. No fruitful

purpose would be served in examining the remaining

witnesses   who   are   formal   in   nature   and   hence

Prosecution Evidence is closed. There being nothing

incriminating has emerged on record, the Statement of

Accused U/S 313 Cr P C is dispensed with.
</p>
<p id="p_7">7.     In view of the above facts and circumstances,

accused Ramesh is acquitted of the offences charged with.

He is on bail, his bail bonds cancelled, surety discharged.

File be consigned to Record Room.
