                        JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">     This is a complaint filed by the complainant under
Sec.200 of <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_2">Cr.PC</a> against the accused for the offence
punishable under Sec.138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act.
</p>
<p id="p_2">2.   The facts of the complaint in brief are that, both the
complainant and accused are known to each other since past
seven years. On account of well acquaintance with the
complainant, the accused has approached the complainant
and requested hand loan an amount of Rs.5,00,000/- during
the month of October 2016 in order to meet out his urgent
need of money and certain financial commitments and
accordingly, considering the request of the accused and on
account of good faith and believe the words of the accused,
the complainant has advanced an amount of Rs.5,00,000/- to
the accused and on that day, the accused has agreed that, he
would repay the said amount within a period of three months
and after lapse of stipulated period on repeated request and
demand made by the complainant to the accused for
repayment of the borrowed loan amount and at that time, the
accused for discharge the loan in question had issued Cheque
bearing   No.517155,   dated:       04.03.2017   for    a   sum   of
Rs.5,00,000/-   drawn     on        State   Bank       of   Mysore,
Hanumanthanagar Branch, Bengaluru IN favour of the
complainant and assured that, the said cheque would be
honoured on its presentation and as per the assurance made
by the accused, the complainant has presented the said
cheque for encashment through his banker i.e., State Bank of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                    3               CC No.16205/2017</span>

Mysore,     SBM     Colony    Branch,    Bengaluru,     but   it   was
dishonoured with an endorsement as "Funds Insufficient"
and thereafter, the complainant has informed the said fact to
the accused, but the accused did not responded the same.
Hence, the complainant had got issued the legal notice on
26.04.2017 through his counsel by RPAD calling upon him to
repay the said borrowed loan amount within 15 days from the
date of receipt of this legal notice and it was duly served upon
the accused.        Despite of service of the legal notice, the
accused neither repaid the borrowed loan amount nor reply
the legal notice. Hence, the complainant had constrained to
file   a   complaint   against    the   accused   for   the   offence
punishable under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_3">Section 138</a> of N.I. Act., which is well
within time and based on the records available on record
cognizance has been taken and registered it PCR.

complainant and complaint is registered in criminal case
register and after issuance of summons to the accused,
pursuant to the summons the accused had appeared before
this Court through his counsel and enlarged on bail.               The
substance of accusation was recorded and read over to the
accused in his vernacular.         He pleaded not guilty.     Hence,
claims for trail.

examined as PW.1 &amp; got 6 documents marked as Ex.P.1 to
Ex.P.6 and PW-1 has been fully cross-examined and the

ingredients under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_5">Section 138</a> of N.I.Act., There is no dispute
that, Ex.P1 cheque belonging to his own bank account and
the signature found on the Ex.P1(a) is his own signature.
</p>
<p id="p_13">13.   It is the case of the complainant that, on account of well
acquainted with the accused, he was advanced the loan
amount of Rs.5,00,000/- to the accused and the accused has
issued cheque in question for repayment of the borrowed loan
amount and when the said cheque presented for encashment
and it was dishoured and subsequently, he was issued legal
notice to the accused and after receipt of the legal notice the
accused has failed to gave reply notice or repay the borrowed
loan amount and thereby, he has filed the present complaint.
</p>

<p id="p_14">14.   On the other hand, it is specific defence of the accused
is that, he was borrowed the loan an amount of Rs.5,00,000/-
from the complainant in the month of April 2012 at the rate
of 3% per month interest in the year 2012 and at that time,
he was issued five MICR cheques to the complainant for the
security purpose and subsequently, he was paid interest
amount to his wife's bank account by way of cheques as well
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                    12             CC No.16205/2017</span>

as cash and in the year 2013, the complainant has return
back old cheques and again he was issued CTS cheque drawn
on   State   Bank   of    Mysore,       Hanumanthanagar   Branch,
Bengaluru and subsequently, he has paid an amount of
Rs.1,00,000/- on 30.04.2013, but the complainant has failed
to return the cheque bearing No.304961 drawn on State Bank
of Mysore, Hanumanthanagar Branch, Bengaluru and again
he was paid an amount of Rs.1,50,000/- by way of cheque
bearing No.145152 on 26.03.2015 and an amount of
Rs.1,50,000/- on 06.05.2015 by way of cheque bearing
No.151155 both the cheques drawn on Suvarna Co-Operative
Bank Limited, Srinagar Branch, Bengaluru and he was paid
an amount of Rs.1,25,000/- by way of cheque bearing
No.304961 on 10.12.2015 drawn on State Bank of Mysore,
Hanumanthanagar          Branch,    Bengaluru   towards   balance
amount along with interest as full and final settlement, but
the said cheque was dishonoured and then the complainant
has return the cheque and collected the amount and the
complainant has failed to return the cheque in question
which was issued for the security purpose even after
repayment of the entire borrowed loan amount and to with an
intention to get wrong full gain, he has misused the cheque in
question and filed the false complaint against the accused
and to substantiate the same he was not produced any
documents except his oral testimony. Therefore, the alleged
defence taken by the accused during the course of his defence
evidence is not sustainable.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                                13                    CC No.16205/2017</span>

<p id="p_15">15.   If really, he was not at all borrowed the loan in question
from the complainant and he has not at all issued the Ex.P1
for discharge of the loan in question to the complainant, he
ought to have gave stop payment instruction to his banker,
he ought to have gave reply notice to the legal notice issued
by the complaint, he ought to have challenged the cognizance
taken by this Court, he ought to have lodged private or police
complaint   against    the   complainant.        Therefore,     non-
performing the aforesaid legal proceedings that itself, it is very
much fatal to the alleged defence set-up by the accused
during the course of cross of his evidence and the cross of
PW-1. There is no dispute that, Ex.P1 cheque is belonging to
his own bank account cheque and signature found on the
Ex.P1(a) is his own signature.      It can be presumed that, the
accused has issued the Ex.P1 to the complainant knowing
fully well without having sufficient funds in his bank account
with an intention to defeat the claim of the complainant.
Further, it can be presumed that, the documents which are
produced by the accused and same are marked as Ex.D1 to
Ex.D10    the   said   documents      relates   to    the   previous
transaction and the said documents are not relevant case in
hand.
</p>

<p id="p_16">16.   With respect to the source of income of the complainant,
he being the lecture by profession and he was retired from his
service and thereby, during the course of his service, he was
getting handsome salary and after retirement he was received
retirement benefit and he being the pensioner. Therefore, it
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                                  14               CC No.16205/2017</span>

can be presumed that, he was having sufficient source of
income for advancement the loan in question to the accused.
Further, the complainant has stated that, he was withdrawn
an amount of from his bank account through self cheque and
same has been advanced to the accused and to substantiate
the same, he was produced his statement of account as pr the
Ex.P6. Therefore, an adverse inference is to be drawn that,
the accused has borrowed the loan in question from him and
for discharge the loan in question he was issued cheque in
question without having sufficient funds in his bank account
with an intention to defeat the claim of the complainant.
</p>

<p id="p_17">17.   Further, the complainant has proved his case by
adducing cogent and corroborative evidence under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_6">Section
138</a> of N.I.Act., On the other hand, the accused has failed to
rebut his case by adducing cogent and corroborative evidence
under <a href="/doc/268919/" id="a_7">Section 139</a> of N.I.Act.,        It can be presumed that, no
any ordinary prudent man will issue signed blank cheque to
any other persons without having monetary transaction
between themselves. It can be presumed that, the drawer of
cheque has to take abundant precaution prior to issuance of
the signed blank cheque to any other persons.          Hence, the
probability of the preponderance is higher on the side of the
complainant, rather than the accused.
</p>

<p id="p_18">18. Ordinarily    offence   under      <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_8">Section   138</a>   of   N.I.Act
"mensrea" is not essential, under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_9">Section 138</a> of N.I.Act , is
bring into operation rule of strict liability, whereas, "mensrea"
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                                15               CC No.16205/2017</span>

<p id="p_19">is essential ingredients in criminal offences. Therefore, The
complainant has proved his case against the accused, since
offence under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_10">Section 138</a> of N.I.Act element of Mensrea has
been excluded in general public interest to curb the instances
of dishonouring of cheque and to lend the credibility to the
commercial transaction.     Therefore, in this case also the
accused knowing fully he was borrowed the loan in question
from the complainant and for discharge the loan in question
he has issued the Ex.P1 to the complainant.           Since the
present complaint is summary trial and quasi-criminal in
nature, it is like recovery proceedings and punishment is fine
or in default of it simple imprisonment.
</p>

<p id="p_20">19.   Hence, in the light of the above observation, the
complainant has successfully proved that, the accused has
committed offence punishable under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_11">Section 138</a> of N.I. Act
with these reasons, I am the opinion that, the complainant
successfully established before the Court, the accused has
issued Ex.P1 to the complainant for the legally recoverably
debt. Therefore, I answer the point No.1 in the affirmative.
