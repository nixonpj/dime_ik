     5.   Director of Directorate of Project Land and Rehabilitation, Bokaro
                                                                    .... Respondents</pre>

<p id="p_1">     CORAM: - HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE RAJESH SHANKAR

     For the Petitioner         :- Mr. Prabhash Kumar, Advocate
     For the Respondents        :- A.C. to S.C. (L&amp;C)

Order No.-04                                         Dated: 25.04.2018

             The defects as pointed out by the office are ignored.
</p>
<p id="p_2">     2.      The present writ petition has been filed for quashing the 'Parcha'
     bearing no. 994 dated 13.06.2017(Annexure-7/1 to the writ petition)
     issued under the signature of the Director, Project Land and
     Rehabilitation, Bokaro (respondent no. 5) whereby the land of village
     Tanrmohanpur, R.T. No. 12, Khata no. 1, Khesra No.-7, rehabilitation
     Plot no. 15 measuring an area of 0.75 acre has been settled in favour
     of Sarbeshwar Mahto, Habulal Mahto and Laru Mahto in so far as it
     relates to settlement of land in question in favour of Habulal Mahto and
     Laru Mahto. Further prayer has been made for quashing the notice
     dated 29.11.2017 issued by the respondent no.3 (Anneuxre-9/1 and
     9/2 to the writ petition) for measurement of land of Smt. Sharda Devi
     to the extent of 0.25 acre without disposing of the objection dated
     06.12.2017 preferred by the petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_3">     3.      Heard learned counsel for the petitioner and the learned A.C. to
     S.C.(L&amp;C).
</p>
<p id="p_4">     4.      Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the land in
     question was settled in favour of Sarbeshwar Mahto on 03.09.1965
     being the displaced person due to acquisition of the land in connection
     with Bokaro Steel Project. The said Sarbeshwar Mahto thereafter made
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                        2</span>



         several family arrangements and sale among the family members in
         the year 1979. The grievance of the petitioner is that a 'Parcha' dated
         13.06.2017 has been issued under the signature of respondent no. 5,
         which contain the names of Habulal Mahto and Laru Mahto in addition
         to Sarbeshwar Mahto but the family arrangements/sale made among
         the family members by Sarbeshwar Mahto pursuant to settlement of
         land has not been taken into consideration. Further grievance of the
         petitioner is that due to issuance of 'Parcha' dated 13.06.2017 by the
         respondent no. 5, Smt. Sharda Devi (wife of late Laru Mahto) has
         preferred an application before the respondent no. 3 for measurement
         of 0.25 acre out of the original 0.75 acre of land, settled in favour of
         Sarbeshwar Mahto. The petitioner has already made objection before
         the respondent no. 3, which has not yet been taken note of.
</p>
<p id="p_5">         5.    Learned counsel for the State submits that the aforesaid issue
         requires factual determination, which cannot be adjudicated in the writ
         jurisdiction. However, if the petitioner files fresh objection/application
         before the respondent no.5, the same shall be considered in
         accordance with law.
</p>
<p id="p_6">         6.    In view of the submission made on behalf of the respondents,
         the petitioner is at liberty to prefer a fresh objection/application before
         the respondent no. 5 against the issuance of 'Parcha' dated 13.06.2017
         (Annexure-7/1 to the writ petition). The respondent no.5, on receipt of
         the said objection/application and on issuance of notices to the
         concerned parties and affording due opportunity of hearing to the
         petitioner and other concerned persons, shall pass appropriate order
         and shall take consequential steps in accordance with law preferably
         within a period of four months from the date of filing of the
         objection/application of the petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_7">         7.    The writ petition is disposed of with the aforesaid observation
         and direction.
