                W. P. C. No.29973 of 2008
          ------------------------------------------------
         Dated this the 10th day of December, 2008

                        JUDGMENT
</pre>

<p id="p_1">    Counsel for the first respondent/first

defendant  submits          that        a      decree      that  is

obtained  by    him       in     his       favour         cannot be

executed on account of the stay granted from

this Court; that the petitioner is not taking

necessary steps to complete service of notice

to respondents 2 and 3 who are plaintiffs in

the suit who suffered a decree the counter

claim advanced by the first respondent having

been decreed and that in the circumstances,

respondents 2 and 3 are not necessary parties

for the purpose of adjudicating the claim that

was advanced by the petitioner and rejected by

the court below. In the circumstances, notice

to respondents 2 and 3 is dispensed with.

</p><p id="p_2">    2. Heard counsel on both sides. The first

respondent   was         the        first           defendant    in

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">W. P. C. No.29973 of 2008         -2-</span>


      O.S.85/97 on the file of the Munsiff's Court,

      Wadakanchery, a suit instituted by respondents

      2 and 3 and their mother for a decree of

      permanent prohibitory injunction restraining

      him from trespassing into the said property

      having an extent of 19 acres claiming title

      over the said property. The first respondent/

      first defendant advanced counter claim for an

      extent of 3.93 acres of land from out of the

      said 19 acres of scheduled property. After

      trial the trial court found that the counter

      claim advanced by the first respondent/first

      defendant stands established in relation to

      3.65 acres and not in relation to 3.93 acres

      claimed by him and granted a decree allowing

      the counter claim in relation to the said 3.65

      acres         and   allowed first   respondent/first

      defendant to have boundaries thereof fixed as

      shown        by    Advocate Commissioner in  Ext.C2

      report and as illustrated in Ext.C4 plan. The

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">W. P. C. No.29973 of 2008         -3-</span>


      decree prayed for by the plaintiffs in the

      suit was negative.
</p>
<p id="p_3">              3.      The  first respondent/decree holder

      filed execution petition in the court below to

      have the decree executed fixing boundaries and

      putting up boundary walls for the said 3.65

      acres. It was then that the petitioner who is

      the sister of respondents 2 and 3 along with

      her other sisters advanced claim to the effect

      that they are also sharers to the scheduled

      property of 19 acres in relation to which suit

      was instituted by respondents 2 and 3 and

      their mother; that therefore, they were also

      necessary parties to the suit and that a

      decree passed in the suit in the counter claim

      advanced by the first respondent without them

      also on the party array is not binding on

      them. The said claim was being advanced on the

      execution          side when   they were   impleaded

      consequent on death of first plaintiff/Suseela

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">W. P. C. No.29973 of 2008         -4-</span>


      who is their mother and also the mother of

      respondents         2  and 3   and other additional

      judgment debtors. The execution court repelled

      their contentions and allowed boundary being

      fixed          and   put    up   deputing  Advocate

      Commissioner         vide Ext.P5  order. Ext.P5  is

      being challenged filing this Writ Petition

      only by the petitioner who is the additional

      fifth         judgment   debtor  in  the  execution

      petition and not by the others.
</p>
<p id="p_4">              4. It is worthy to note that the suit was

      being instituted by respondents 2 and 3 and

      their mother against the first respondent and

      the first respondent was advancing only a

      counter claim therein. Though the additional

      judgment debtors 4 to 9 including the present

      petitioner were impleaded on the execution

      side as the LRs of the deceased first judgment

      debtor who was their mother it is the case of

      the       petitioner    and   the other  additional

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">W. P. C. No.29973 of 2008         -5-</span>


      judgment debtors also that they are co-owners

      with respondents 2 and 3 who were plaintiffs 2

      and 3 in the suit. That means there was

      substantial representation on behalf of the

      petitioner, and respondents 2 and 3 along with

      their mother filed the suit for and on behalf

      of      the     other co-owners  as well  and  they

      resisted counter claim for and on behalf of

      also        other   co-owners.  A  decree  obtained

      allowing the counter claim advanced by the

      first respondent is hence, binding on all the

      co-owners including the present petitioner and

      they have no right to resist execution of the

      decree when the other co-owners who resisted

      the      counter     claim was  not  successful  in

      establishing the rights set up by them or to

      resist         the  claim  advanced by   the  first

      respondent/first        defendant  in  the  counter

      claim. Thus, there is no merit in this Writ

      Petition filed by the petitioner.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">W. P. C. No.29973 of 2008         -6-</span>


</p><p id="p_5">              5. It is further contended by the counsel

      for the petitioner that though when impleaded

      as additional judgment debtors consequent on

      death of their mother the petitioner as also

      her sisters did step into the shoe of the

      judgment debtors, they have got a contention

      that the decree has been collusively obtained

      between the first defendant and respondents 2

      and 3 and their mother. If at all they have

      got such a case of collusion and fraud which

      would        vitiate   the decree,  they  can  seek

      appropriate relief elsewhere and they cannot

      resist execution of the decree in the present

      suit.
</p>
<pre id="pre_2">              6.        This  Writ   Petition    in   the

      circumstances, is dismissed.
