the vacancies in the Indian Administrative Service by promotion which is

 to be filled in accordance with the provisions contained in the Indian
Administrative Service (fixation of Cadre Strength) Regulations, 1954. The
Central Government has also framed the Indian Administrative Service
(Recruitment) Rules, 1954 which provides that there are three methods of
recruitment to the IAS; i.e.:
</p>
<pre id="pre_3">        (a)     By a competitive examination;
        (b)     By promotion of a [substantive] member of a State Civil

                members of a State Civil Service.
</p>

<p id="p_3">2.      As per clause (a) of sub rule 1 of Rule 4, the recruitment is by
competitive examination. Clause (b) provides for recruitment by promotion
of a substantive member of the State Civil Service. Clause (c) stipulates
following mode:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">        "By selection, in special cases from among persons, who hold in
        a substantive capacity gazette posts in connection with the
        affairs of a State and who are not members of a State Civil
        Service."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_4">3.      In so far as recruitment by promotion or selection for appointment to
State and joint cadre is concerned it is regulated by Rule 8 of 1954 Rules,
which reads as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">        "8. Recruitment by promotion or selection for appointment

        such regulations as the Central Government may, after

        affairs of the State who is not a member of the State Civil

<p id="p_5">4.      Central Government has also framed the Indian Administrative
Service (Appointment by Promotion) Regulations, 1995 (herein referred to
as „the Promotion Regulations, 1955).           Appointment by selection is
governed by the Indian Administrative Service (Appointment by selection),
Regulations, 1997 (herein referred to as Regulations 1997).
</p>
<p id="p_6">5.      In the year 2001 four vacancies were earmarked in the State quota
for inclusion in Indian Administrative Service from the State of Haryana
two posts were earmarked for officials who were members of State Civil
Service whereas the other two were earmarked for Non-State Civil Services
in accordance with sub-Clause (c ) Sub-rule 1 of Rule 4 of 1954
Regulations as aforesaid.       Sh. J.D.Naharwal, respondent No.1 was a
member of the Haryana State Civil Service (Executive Branch) having
joined the service in September, 1983 and was an aspirant to be included
in Indian Administrative Service.       Sh.   Jai   Paul   Singh   Dahiya      was
another aspirant who wanted his inclusion from category of Non-SCS
officers.
</p>
<p id="p_7">6.      However, on account of the deficiency in supply of information
regarding eligible candidates to be considered in the category of Non-SCS
officers, UPSC in exercise of the powers available with it as per Regulations

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">W.Ps.(C) 6474/2003, 7220/2003                                  Page 3 of 17</span>
 5(1)(c) of the Regulations of 1997 declared that it was not practicable to
hold a meeting of the Selection Committee during the relevant year i.e. in
the year 2001 in the circumstances explained in the letter dated
04.02.2002 and accordingly Union of India decided to carry forward those
two vacancies in the next year 2002. It may be observed here that Shri
J.D.Naharwal who was not even in the zone of consideration in the year
2001 if the vacancies meant for State Civil Service were to be confined only
to two made a representation assailing the aforesaid decision to carry
forward the vacancies to the next year as it was his stand that those
vacancies remaining unfilled with respect to the category of Non-SCS
officers were then required to be considered available for SCS officers of the
State cadre in the year 2001 itself and if that would have been done the
said Shri Naharwal being member of State Civil Services would have been
in the zone of consideration if vacancies stood increased to 4.
</p>
<p id="p_8">7.      As his representation was not considered, Shri J.D.Naharwal
aggrieved from the aforesaid, declaration and decision taken by Union of
India, arrayed as the first respondent in both the aforesaid writ petition,
and one Jai Paul Singh Dahiya who filed a separate writ petition bearing
No 3414/2003 which now stands dismissed in default vide order dated
03.08.2010        assailed      the   aforesaid   declaration   before   the       Central
Administrative Tribunal to set aside the aforesaid action of the Union of
India and to direct inclusion of these 2 posts as part of the State Civil
Services officers cadre for the year 2001 itself and to fill them up by
holding a review DPC.            Sh. Jai Paul Dahiya on the other hand wanted
carrying forward of these vacancies in the quota of Non-SCS officers for the
next year.
</p>
<p id="p_9">8.      The application filed by Shri Jai Paul Singh Dahiya was registered as
OA No. 115/2003 while that of Shri J.D.Naharwal was registered as OA
No. 2042/2002 and both these applications were decided by a common
order by the Central Administrative Tribunal Principal Bench vide order
dated 02.05.2003.

<p id="p_10"> 9.      Vide impugned order the Tribunal dismissed the application filed by
Sh.Jai Paul Singh Dahiya but allowed the application of Shri J.D.Naharwal
the first respondent and gave the following directions:
</p>

        allowed and it is directed that:-

<blockquote id="blockquote_7">        (a)   the decision to fill up the vacancies in the Indian
        Administrative Service of Haryana Cadre from amongst non-

<blockquote id="blockquote_8">        (b)  the decision to carry forward two vacancies earmarked for

<blockquote id="blockquote_9">        (c)   the vacancies, if any would revert back to the State Civil
        Service Officers eligible for the year 2001; and

        held to prepare the revised list of the remaining eligible State
        Civil Service officers who may be within the zone of
        consideration.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_11">10.     Aggrieved by the aforesaid directions UOI has filed Civil Writ Petition
No. 6474/2003 praying for setting aside the order passed by the Tribunal
and to permit them to carry forward the aforesaid 2 vacancies to the year
2002.      Praveen Kumar, the second writ petitioner has filed CWP No.
7220/2003        without        having   approached   the   Central     Administrative
Tribunal and coming directly to this Court for seeking a similar direction
as prayed for by Union of India. According to him, if vacancies are carried
forward to the next year, he would come in the zone of consideration for
the next year as a member of Haryana State Civil Service, even though he
was not in the zone of consideration for the year 2001 and even if the
vacancies are considered as part of the quota meant for State Civil Service
for the said year.
</p><p id="p_12">11.     It is the submission of both the petitioners that the directions given
by the Tribunal could not be given as they are in the teeth of Regulation 5
of the 1955 Regulations.             Submissions were that after the vacancies
earmarked for Non-SCS Officers for the year 2001 are not filled up and if they
are filled up from amongst those Officers who belong to SCS Cadre it will disturb
the ratio/quota maintained between the Non-SCS Officers and SCS officers.            It


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">W.Ps.(C) 6474/2003, 7220/2003                                         Page 5 of 17</span>
 is also contended that there is no provision in the Rules for holding year
wise DPC.        It is also contended of the petitioner that there is also no
provision for holding review DPC with reference to the particular year.
</p>
<p id="p_13">12.     According to the petitioners the system of carrying forward of
vacancies is inbuilt into Regulation 5 of the aforesaid Regulations,
vacancies of each year are determined with reference to substantive
vacancies of 1st January of the year. It is also submitted that first proviso
of Regulation 5(1) provides that no meeting of the Committee shall be held
and the selected list for the year in question shall be prepared when there
are no substantive vacancies or the Central Government in consultation
with the State Government decides that recruitment shall be made during
the year to substantive vacancies. This Rule clearly indicates that it is not
necessary that determination of vacancies and preparation of the Select
List must be done for each of the year.        It is further argued that the
vacancy which is not filled up in a particular year gets merged with the
pool of vacancies to be determined for the subsequent year(s) and there is
no concept of wait list and review DPC in the Rules or in the Regulations.
Learned counsel further argues that method of recruitment to be adopted
for the purpose of filling up particular vacancy or vacancies during
particular year is to be determined by the Central Government in
consultation with the Commission and the State Government concerned.
Where a vacancy occurs in a State Cadre which is to be filled under the
provisions of Rule 8, the vacancy shall be filled by promotion of the
member of State Civil Service or as the case may be, by selection of any
other office serving in connection with the affairs of the States. This is the
position contained in Rule 4(2)(a)(b) and Rule 8(3)(a) of the IAS
Recruitment Rules, 1955.

Hon‟ble Supreme Court in the case of Tamil Nadu Administrative Service

where in para 32 of the judgment it has been held:

<blockquote id="blockquote_11">         "32. We think that this is a matter of policy which will be
        uniformly applicable after the amendments. Further, vacancies
        which are not filled up in one year will automatically get carried
        forward to the next year if they become actual vacancies by

        amendment is arbitrary and violative of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_1">Article 14</a> of the
        Constitution cannot be accepted."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_15">14.     The Tribunal however having considered the matter in detail in the
light of the rule position did not find favour with the Union of India who
was a party before the Tribunal. The Tribunal has observed:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_12">        17. We have already referred to above that the term "year"
        means the period commencing on the first day of January and
        ending on the 31st December of the same year. The Regulations
        of 1955 prescribe that no meeting of the Committee shall be
        held and no list for the year shall be prepared if substantive
        vacancies do not exist or the Central Government in
        consultation with the State Government decides that no
        recruitment shall be made during the year to the substantive
        vacancies. But it is mandatory that the select has to be
        prepared separately for each year from the date the Committee
        could not meet as on the 31st December of each year. To this
        extent, there is little controversy. The Supreme Court in the
        case of P.M.Bayas Vs. Union of India &amp; Ors. (1993) 3 SCC 319
        was considering the Recruitment Rules of 1954 particularly the
        expression "in special cases from among persons" in Rule 4(1)(c)
        of the said Rules and the expression "In special circumstances"
        in Rule 8(2) of the said Rules.       The relevant rules were
        interpreted and it was held:-
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_13">        9. We may examine the scheme of the Rules and Regulations.
        Rule 4(1) of the Rules provides four sources of recruitment to
        the IAS. The competitive examination and by promotion of
        substantive members of the State Civil Service are the two main
        sources of recruitment. Rule 4(1)(c) provides recruitment to IAS
        "by selection, in special cases from among persons, who hold in
        a substantive capacity gazetted posts in connection with the
        affairs of a State and who are not members of the State Civil
        Service". "In special cases from among persons" means the
        selection as special cases of the persons who have established
        their outstanding merit and ability while serving the State.
        Members of the State Civil Service who are not 'outstanding' but
        are only 'good' and 'very good' are also eligible to be considered
        for appointment to IAS but under Rule 8(2) of the Rules, it is
        only an 'outstanding' officer who is eligible. It is the outstanding
        merit and ability which makes him a 'special case' in terms of
        Rule 8(2) of the Rules. Rule 8(2) of the Rules read with
        Regulation 3 of the Regulations lays down the procedure for
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">W.Ps.(C) 6474/2003, 7220/2003                                  Page 7 of 17</span>
         making the special selection provided under Rule 4(1)(c) of the
        Rules. The Central Government, being the appointing authority
        to the IAS, has to be finally satisfied about the existence of the
        "special circumstances" as a condition precedent for making
        special recruitment. The "special circumstances" are to be
        spelled-out from Rule 8(2) of the Rules read with Regulation 3 of
        the Regulations. Rule 8(2) which talks of "outstanding ability
        and merit" when read with Regulation 3(1) and 3(4A) of the
        Regulations makes it clear that the "special circumstances"
        required to be seen are (i) the existence of officers with 12 years
        of continuous service in a gazetted post under the State
        Government other than State Civil Service Officers - who are of
        outstanding merit and ability and (ii) the satisfaction of the
        State Government that, in public interest, it is necessary to
        consider such officers for promotion to the IAS.

<blockquote id="blockquote_14">        18. Similarly in the case of Union of India &amp; Ors. Vs.
        Vipinchandra Hiralal Shah, JT 1996 (9) S.C. 686, the
        controversy was about the failure of the selection committee to
        meet during a particular year to prepare the select list for
        promotion to the Indian Administrative Service. The Supreme
        Court held that if for any reason the selection committee is not
        able to meet during a particular year, the committee when it
        meets next, should while making the selection, prepare a
        separate list for each year keeping in view the number of
        vacancies in that year. In paragraph 11, the findings returned
        were:-
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_15">        "11. It must, therefore, held that in view of the provisions
        contained in Regulation 5, unless there is a good reason for not
        doing so, the Selection Committee is required to meet every year
        for the purpose of making the selection from amongst State civil
        Service officers who fulfil the conditions regarding eligibility on
        the first day of the January of the year in which the Committee
        meets and fall within the zone of consideration as prescribed in
        Clause (2) of Regulation 5. The failure on the part of the Selection
        Committee to meet during a particular year would not dispense
        with the requirement of preparing the Select List for that year. If
        for any reason the Selection Committee is not able to meet during
        a particular year, the Committee when it meets next, should,
        while making the selection, prepare a separate list for each year
        keeping in view the number of vacancies in that year after
        considering the State Civil Service officers who were eligible and
        fall within the zone of consideration for selection in that year."
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_16">        19. From the aforesaid decisions, it is clear that the clubbing
        of vacancies per year is not permissible. As a general rule, the
        promotion to the Indian Administrative Service has to be made
        from the State Civil Service officers and the persons not
        belonging to the State Civil Service come as an exception. They
        can only be taken into service as per their fixed quota but

         subject to their satisfying the necessary norms which we have
        already referred to above and require no repetition.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_17">        20. The Regulations of 1997 explicitly deals with this
        controversy. At the risk of repetition, we mention that term
        "year" means the period commencing on the first day of
        January and ending 31st December of the same year. Rule 4 of
        the Regulations of 1997 specifically deals with the cases of
        persons not belonging to the State Civil Service but serving in
        connection with the affairs of the State.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_18">        21. Regulation 5 refers to the representation of a list of
        suitable officers by the committee. Necessarily, the selection of
        suitable officers has to be made and meeting held for the year in
        question but an important aspect of the same is that no
        meeting of the committee has to be held and no lit of any non-
        State Civil Service officers is to be prepared if there are no
        substantive vacancies and the Commission declares that it is
        not practicable to hold a meeting of the Committee during that
        year. This declaration of the Union Public Service Commission is
        a very important act because once such a declaration is issued,
        no meeting should be held to fill up the vacancies from the non-
        State Civil Service officers. In the case of J.D.Naharwal, our
        attention has been drawn towards an order issued by the Union
        Public Service Commission dated 09.01.2002 which reads as
        under:-

<blockquote id="blockquote_19">                "I am directed to refer to the subject mentioned above and
                to say that a proposal for convening the selection

                appointment to the IAS of Haryana Cadre during the year
                2001 was received from the Govt. of Haryana on
                26.12.2001. The Govt. of India had determined the
                number of vacancies available for Non-SCS officers as
                2(two). The State Govt. had recommended the names of
                four officers against the two vacancies.

<blockquote id="blockquote_20">                2.    Since the proposal of the State Govt. was
                incomplete, a letter was issued on 27.12.2001 requesting
                the State Govt. to furnish the deficient information and
                records. They were also requested to furnish some more
                names since a maximum of 10 officers could be
                considered against two vacancies. The State Govt. vide
                their Fax message dated 27.12.2001 &amp; 28.12.2001
                furnished some of the deficient information and records.
                However, the clarification furnished by them regarding
                the eligibility of some of the officers was not complete.
                The proposal of the State Govt. having been received in
                the Commission‟s office only a few days before the end of
                the year, the deficiencies could not be made good by the

                 provisions of the IAS (Appointment by Selection)
                Regulations, 1997, the Select List for the year 2001 for
                appointment of Non-SCS officers was to be prepared
                latest by 31.12.2001. In the circumstances explained
                above, the meeting of the selection committee for
                preparation of a Select List of Non-SCS officers (IAS-
                Haryana Cadre) could not be held during the year 2001.

<blockquote id="blockquote_21">                3.    Accordingly, in exercise of the powers conferred by

        Administrative Service of Haryana Cadre during the year 2001.

<blockquote id="blockquote_23">        22. Can we say that this declaration by the Union Public
        Service Commission is meaningless? The answer would be that
        it is meaningful. The purpose of making such a provision is
        obvious. Once such a declaration is issued, the right of
        consideration by the non-State Civil Service officers is lost. The
        exercise if any is, therefore, in futility. This is for the added
        reason that the primary right for consideration is that of the
        State Civil Service officers and consideration of non-State Civil
        Service officers is an exception. There is no provision to carry
        forward the said vacancies for the non-State Civil Service
        officers. It cannot be so carried forward particularly when such
        a declaration as referred to above had been issued. The
        clubbing of vacancies otherwise is not permitted.

        (fixation of Cadre Strength ) Regulations, 1955. The Central
        Government has also framed the Indian Administrative Service
        (Recruitment), 1954 which provide that there are three methods
        of recruitment to the IAS. As per clause (a) sub rule 1 the
        recruitment is by competitive examination. Clause (b) provides
        for recruitment by promotion of a substantive member of the
        State Civil Service. Clause (c) with which we are concerned

        after, certain vacancies for these years could not be filled up
        i.e. one vacancy for the year 2001, 2 vacancies for the year 2002
        and 7 vacancies for the year 2004. All these vacancies were
        carried forward by the Central Government to the year 2005 to
        be filled up along with the vacancies of 2005. Some officers who
        were eligible for consideration in the previous year challenged
        this action of the petitioner herein. In so far as this writ petition
        is concerned, it may be mentioned that two OAs , namely, OA
        No. 1097/2006 and OA No. 1137/2006 were filed by some such
        officers (Respondent Nos. 3 to 7 herein) . The action of the
        petitioner/Central Government was challenged on the ground
        that vacancy of a particular year should have been filled in that
        year only and even if it could not be filled for certain reasons,
        there should be a review DPC for that year to fill up the said
        vacancy. It was also argued that even if the vacancies to be
        filled up are related to SCS Cadre and candidates from said
        cadre were not available, then the vacancies should have been
        filled from the employees belonging to the officers of State Civil

        learned counsel for either side which have been discussed by

         the Non-SCS Officers. It is also contended that there is no
        provision in the Rules for holding year wise DPC. It is also the
        contention of the petitioner that there is also no provision for
        holding review DPC with reference to the particular year. Since
        these arguments are predicated on the position contained in
        Rule 5 of the Regulations 1955, we deem it appropriate to

<blockquote id="blockquote_36">        5(1)Each Committee shall ordinarily meet every year and

        held by them to be suitable for promotion to the service. The
        number of members of the State Civil Service to be included in
        the list shall be determined by the Central Government in
        consultation with the State Government, concerned, and shall
        not exceed the number of substantive vacancies as on the first
        day of January of the year in which the meeting is held, in the
        posts available for them under Rule 9 of the Recruitment Rules.
        The date and venue of the meeting of the Committee to make

        that the system of carry forward of vacancies is inbuilt into

         Regulation 5 of the aforesaid Regulations, vacancies of each
        year are determined with reference to substantive vacancies of
        1st January of the year. It is also submitted that first proviso of
        Regulation 5(1) provides that no meeting of the Committee shall
        be held and the selected list for the year in question shall be
        prepared when there are no substantive vacancies or the
        Central Government in consultation with the State Government
        decides that recruitment shall be made during the year to
        substantive vacancies. This Rule clearly indicates that it is not
        necessary that determination of vacancies and preparation of
        the Select List must be done for each of the year. It is further
        argued that the vacancy which is not filled in a particular year
        gets merged with the pool of vacancies to be determined for the
        subsequent year(s) and there is no concept of wait list and
        review DPC in the Rules or in the Regulations. Learned counsel
        further argues that method of recruitment to be adopted for the
        purpose of filling up particular vacancy or vacancies during
        particular year is to be determined by the Central Government
        in consultation with the Commission and the State
        Government concerned. Where a vacancy occurs in a State
        Cadre which is to be filled under the provisions of Rule 8, the
        vacancy shall be filled by promotion of the member of State Civil
        Service or as the case may be, by selection of any other office
        serving in connection with the affairs of the States. This is the
        position contained in Rule 4(2)(a)(b) and Rule 8(3)(a) of the IAS
        Recruitment Rules, 1955.

<blockquote id="blockquote_44">        Though the aforesaid arguments may appear to be attractive in
        the first blush, it loses its sheen and force when we consider
        these arguments with reference to other provisions of the
        relevant Rules and Regulations and the manner they are
        interpreted by the Supreme Court. We observe that all these
        aspects are considered by the Tribunal in greater details and
        therefore, it would not be necessary to unnecessary burden this
        judgment by repeating the same, more so when after reading
        the judgment of the Tribunal, we are in agreement with those
        reasons and the conclusions of the Tribunal. Therefore, we
        would be indicating our reasons in brief to support the
        conclusion arrived at by the learned Tribunal.

<p id="p_21">20.     Thus the Division Bench held that the directions given by the
Tribunal to hold a review DPC to fill up those vacancies if remained
unfilled on account of non-availability         of Non-SCS officers in that
particular area from amongst the members of service who were within the
zone of consideration was legal and valid as it was in the tune with
principles of law laid down of the Supreme Court in the case of Union of
India &amp; Ors. Vs. Vipinchandra Hiralal Shah (supra)
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">W.Ps.(C) 6474/2003, 7220/2003                                  Page 15 of 17</span>
</p><p id="p_22"> 21.     In the present case also there was no nomination of Non-SCS
officers as no list could be prepared because the meeting of the selection
Committee could not take place for considering the nomination of Non-
SCS officers in the year 2001 in the State of Haryana also.
</p>
<p id="p_23">22.     This is also the view taken by the Tribunal in the case before us.
Accordingly, we hold that directions given by the Tribunal which are in
accordance with a decision of the Division Bench of this Court and the
issue is no more res integra. In so far as Praveen Kumar is concerned, in
addition to the reasons as aforesaid we also find that he having
approached this Court directly is not even otherwise entitled to maintain
the writ petition. Further the Hon‟ble Supreme Court in Civil Appeal No.
2653-54 of 2010 arising out of SLP (C ) No. 7686-7687/2009) in the case
of Rajeev Kumar and Anr. Vs. Hemraj Singh Chauhan &amp; Ors has observed:

<blockquote id="blockquote_45">        12. The Constitution          Bench       explained      the said
        statement      of     law   by reiterating         in the next
        sentence:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_46">        "..By this, we mean that it will not be open for litigants to
        directly approach the High Court even in cases where they
        question the vires of statutory         legislations (except, as
        mentioned, where the legislation which           creates      the
        particular Tribunal      is   challenged)     by overlooking the
        jurisdiction of the Tribunal concerned.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_47">        13. On a proper reading of these two sentences, it is clear:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_48">        (a)    The Tribunals will function as the only Court of first
        instance in respect of the areas of law for which they have
        been constituted.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_49">        (b) Even where any challenge is made to         the    vires    of
        legislation, excepting the legislation under which Tribunal has
        been set up, in such cases also, litigants will not be     able to
        directly approach the High Court overlooking the jurisdiction of
        the Tribunal'.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_50">        14. The aforesaid propositions have been repeated again by the
        Constitution Bench in the penultimate paragraph 99 at page
        311 of the report in the following words:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_51">        "...The Tribunals will, nevertheless, continue to act like courts
        of first instance in respect of the areas of law for which they
        have      been constituted. It will not,    therefore, be open for
        litigants to directly approach the High Courts even in cases
        where they question the vires of statutory legislations (except
        where the legislation which creates the particular Tribunal is

         challenged) by overlooking the jurisdiction of the Tribunal
        concerned...."
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_52">        15.    In   view    of    such    repeated     and    authoritative
        pronouncement by the Constitution Bench of this Court, the
        approach made to the High Court for the first time by these
        appellants in respect of their service disputes over        which
        C.A.T. has jurisdiction, is not legally sustainable. The Division
        Bench of the High Court, with great respect, fell into an error by
        allowing the appellants to treat the High Court as a Court of
        first instance in respect of their service           disputes, for
        adjudication of which C.A.T. has been constituted.
</blockquote><p id="p_24">23.     Before parting with the case, we may note that in the case which
was decided by our co-ordinate bench in respect of the employees of U.P.
State on account of carrying forward the vacancies of the year 2001, 2002
and 2004 this Court has observed that not only the vacancies were carried
forward but they were not even filled up. As on the date of the judgment
delivered by the co-ordinate bench on 05.02.2009 there were 106
vacancies which were to be filled up under the promotion quota thereby
seriously affecting the functioning of the administration and denying the
dues of the State Services Officers in the quota of Indian Administrative
Services. The case of Haryana also appears` to be no exception.

to costs.
