consisting of Chief Justice S.R. Bannurmath and Kurian Joseph, J. (as he

then was), the matter was referred to the Full Bench doubting the

correctness of the judgment in W.A. No.1505/2006.
</p>
<p id="p_6">      4. We heard learned Senior Counsel Shri P. Ravindran and learned

Counsel Shri B. Gopakumar, appearing for the appellants/petitioners, Shri

P.V. Mohanan, learned counsel appearing for the contesting respondents

and Smt. Girija Gopal, learned Senior Government Pleader appearing for

the official respondents.
</p>
<p id="p_7">      5. The dispute, shortly stated, is one concerning the principles for

fixing the seniority. As far as the petitioners in W.P.(C) No.11178/2005

are concerned, they were appointed as Excise Guards in the Excise

Division, Palakkad. The contesting respondents 5 to 15 therein, who are

W.A.Nos.1466/2006 &amp; 802/2007
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">&amp; W.P.(C) No.26361/2006                 3</span>

appellants in W.A. Nos.1466/2006 and 802/2007, were appointed in the

Excise Divisions Ernakulam, Kannur and Kasaragod. They were appointed

through the Public Service Commission and were transferred to Palakkad

Division as per various orders produced as Exts.P3 to P5, before completing

less than one year of service in the respective Excise Divisions. The

present dispute arose when the final seniority list of Excise Guards of

Palakkad Division was published as per Ext.P13. The petitioners were

included in the provisional seniority list of Excise Guards in Palakkad

Division, Ext.P7, and respondents 5 to 15 were not included therein, but

were included in the seniority lists published in their respective district of

appointment. But later, respondents 5 to 15 were put enblock as seniors to

the petitioners in Ext.P13. The learned Single Judge allowed the writ

petitions accepting the contentions of the writ petitioners that the

transferees will get seniority in the new unit only after completion of five

years from the date of their initial appointment, as they were eligible for

transfer only in terms of Exts.P1 and P2 Government Orders which have put

a restriction on inter district transfer before completion of five years. The

said view has been upheld by the Division Bench in W.A.No.1505/2006.

</p><p id="p_8">      6. Shri P. Ravindran, learned Senior Counsel contended that as far as

W.A.Nos.1466/2006 &amp; 802/2007
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">&amp; W.P.(C) No.26361/2006                4</span>

the appointment of Excise Guards are concerned, they were appointed in

particular divisions and the appointment is not district-wise.           The

Government Orders like Exts.P1 and P2 providing for inter district transfer

and the restrictions therein will not, therefore, apply to them. As far as the

appointment and transfer of Excise Guards are concerned, they are governed

by Rules 10 and 11 of the Kerala Excise and Prohibition Subordinate

Service Special Rules, 1974 and as empowered by Rule 11, the competent

authority transferred the appellants as per Exts.P3 to P5 orders. Therefore,

as far as such transferees are concerned their seniority will have to be

reckoned in terms of the first proviso to Rule 27(a) of Kerala State and

Subordinate Service Rules (for short KS &amp; SSR) and therefore they will get

seniority from the date of their joining in the transferee division. It is

pointed out that in the Government             Orders Exts.P1 and P2, no

consequences have been provided, if the inter-unit transfer is effected

before completion     of five years. Elaborating his contentions, learned

Senior Counsel also submitted that the executive orders which go against

the provisions of the statutory rules, cannot have effect in deciding the

issue. It is also submitted that as far as inter division transfer of Excise

Guards are concerned, the orders Exts.P1 and P2 will not apply, meaning

W.A.Nos.1466/2006 &amp; 802/2007
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">&amp; W.P.(C) No.26361/2006               5</span>

thereby that they will govern only persons who are not covered by the

Special Rules. It is submitted that the court cannot supply words to a statute

which principle is well settled. Reliance is also placed on the decision of

the Apex Court in <a href="/doc/358939/" id="a_1">Sudhakaran v. State of Kerala</a> (2006 (2) KLT 817 -

SC), interpreting Rule 27(a) and the proviso thereto of KS &amp; SSR.

</p><p id="p_9">       7. Learned Senior Government Pleader, Smt. Girija Gopal, who

appeared for the official respondents, submitted that the scheme for inter

district transfer is governed by various Government Orders issued from

1960 onwards. After the Public Service Commission started recruitment on

district-wise basis, these Government Orders have been re-issued with

modified terms to protect the Public Service Commission hands who are

awaiting appointments.        The Government have prescribed various

stipulations from time to time as far as inter district transfer is concerned

and the important one is that a transfer will be allowed only after

completion of five years in the district of recruitment and the exception, if

any, will require the approval of the Council of Ministers. Our attention

was invited to various Government Orders in the matter. It is further

submitted that as far as Excise Guards are concerned, their appointments are

also district-wise, as the division, going by various circulars in the Excise

W.A.Nos.1466/2006 &amp; 802/2007
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">&amp; W.P.(C) No.26361/2006                6</span>

Department, is the Revenue District itself. It is submitted that the Special

Rules relied upon by the learned Senior Counsel for the appellants only

provide for the specified authority for issuing the order of transfer (Rule 11)

and therefore their transfers are also governed by the stipulations contained

in Exts.P1 and P2 orders. It is pointed out that in various Government

Orders the Government have stipulated that the adherence of five years rule

should be there and the exceptions are minimum, which are also governed

by the various Government Orders. It is pointed out that the appellants

cannot get the benefit of relaxation        and they were transferred after

specifying a condition in the orders of transfer itself that for the purpose of

appointment, seniority, etc. the Division in which they were appointed will

be the unit.
</p>
<p id="p_10">       8.   These contentions were supported by the learned counsel

appearing for the contesting respondents in the appeals,             Shri P.V.

Mohanan. It is argued that the proviso to Rule 27(a) is only the one

prescribing a principle for fixing the seniority and it is not the provision

under which inter district/inter-unit-wise transfers are being made. Various

Government Orders in the matter from 1960 onwards provide for inter

district transfer and from 1971 onwards the district has been made as the

W.A.Nos.1466/2006 &amp; 802/2007
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">&amp; W.P.(C) No.26361/2006                7</span>

unit of appointment. In respect of Excise Guards also, the revenue district

is the unit. Therefore, the Government Orders Exts.P1 and P2 will apply.

The decentralisation was made in 1971 making recruitment district-wise in

various categories of posts and the district is the unit for appointment, for

promotion, discharge as well as seniority. The specific conditions under

which the appellants were transferred, are clear from Exts.P3 and P4

transfer orders, whereby for the purpose of their appointment, discharge

and seniority, the parent unit itself will have to be considered. It is pointed

out that only when a transfer is made on a substantive basis along with the

transfer of lien alone, they will get any such rights in the transferred unit.

Therefore, as far as the appellants are concerned, their lien was retained in

the parent unit. Our attention was invited to definition of 'cadre' under Rule

12(4) of Part I of Kerala Service Rules (for short 'K.S.R.') and the definition

of "member of service" in the KS &amp; SSR and the provisions relating

transfer and termination of lien. It is therefore submitted that the reliance

placed on the decision of the Apex Court in Sudhakran's case (2006 (2)

KLT 817 - SC) cannot help the appellants. It is also submitted that the

Special Rules herein, viz. Kerala Excise and Prohibition Subordinate

Service Special Rules, 1974 itself was adopted only in 1974, whereas the

W.A.Nos.1466/2006 &amp; 802/2007
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">&amp; W.P.(C) No.26361/2006              8</span>

inter-district/inter-departmental transfers were governed by various

Government Orders issued from 1960 onwards. It is thus submitted that

there is no conflict between the provisions of the executive orders and that

of the Special Rules and the proviso to Rule 27(a) of KS &amp; SSR. Learned

counsel also submitted that the transfer made herein is by invoking the

general power of transfer and it is not one made under Rule 11 of the

Special Rules.
</p>
<p id="p_11">      9. The condition under which the appellants were transferred, as

evident from Exts.P4 and P5, reads as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">        "For the purpose of appointment, re-appointment to the service

        whether as full member or not discharge from service and seniority

        among members of the service that the excise divisions in which

        they were originally appointed shall be the unit of those Excise

        Guards as per Rule 10 of the Special Rules."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_12">It was ordered for administrative convenience and in public interest. The

impact of the same will have to be considered, to analyse the contentions of

the appellants.
</p>
<p id="p_13">      10. A survey of the various Government Orders will throw light on

the various aspects including the insistence for adhering to the conditions

for inter-district and inter-departmental transfers.  The first among the

W.A.Nos.1466/2006 &amp; 802/2007
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">&amp; W.P.(C) No.26361/2006              9</span>

Government Orders to be considered is G.O.(Ms) 4/61/PD dated 2.1.1961.

The same was issued in consultation with the Public Service Commission.

It provides that "mutual or inter-departmental transfers of Government

servants from one unit to another within the same Department, or from one

Department to another within the same Subordinate service may be ordered

by the Appointing Authority concerned" on request, subject to certain

conditions. The important conditions were the following:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">        (i) A person transferred to a new unit will take rank below the

        juniormost in the category in the new Unit or Department. He will

        not be allowed to count his previous service towards seniority, but

        it will be counted towards increment, leave, pension, gratuity, etc.;


</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">        (ii) A permanent person need to be required to relinquish the

        permanency. He can retain his permanent lien in the old post until

        he is confirmed in the new unit or department; and


</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">         (iii) Persons transferred from one department to another or from

         one unit to another in the same department due to proved

         administrative reasons will retain all their rights in the old unit or

         department, as the case may be."</blockquote><p id="p_14">

</p><p id="p_15">     11. As per a memorandum dated 9.1.1960, the district-wise recruitees

who have been recruited on the basis of their option to a district, cannot be

W.A.Nos.1466/2006 &amp; 802/2007
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">&amp; W.P.(C) No.26361/2006                 10</span>

transferred to other district except on administrative grounds. By

Memorandum No.52251/S(B)4/61.PD dated 24.10.1961 it was clarified that

"the restrictions in the said memorandum of 1960 are still in force and the

concession granted in G.O.(MS) No.4/1961", will be subject to the

restrictions.  The subsequent Government Orders will show that               the

insistence on the observance of the conditions was scrupulously being

maintained. The next important Government Order is G.O.(Ms)154/71/PD

dated 27.5.1971. The same was issued in the light of decentralisation of

the functions of recruitment to the District Recruitment Boards, in respect of

recruitment to the Lower Ministerial Cadres at district level. Importantly, it

was provided that recruitment at district level through such Recruitment

Boards will be subject to various conditions including the following:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_6">         (i) No transfers will be allowed from one District to another within

         a period of five years from the date of commencement of

         continuous service;
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_7">         (ii) Such inter-district transfers will be allowed only after five years

         and subject to the conditions laid down in G.O.(Ms) No.4/PD dated

         2.1.1961."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_16">Subsequent additions have been made for appointment to various posts by

W.A.Nos.1466/2006 &amp; 802/2007
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">&amp; W.P.(C) No.26361/2006                11</span>

issuing separate orders.
</p>
<p id="p_17">      12.    We will now refer to the Government Orders providing for

relaxation of the conditions in certain specific circumstances. In G.O.(Ms)

No.331/76/PD dated 27.9.1976, relaxation was made in respect of

relatives/dependents of serving soldiers and relatives, dependents of

defence personnel killed in action, with regard to the stipulations in G.O.

(Ms) No.154/71/PD dated 27.5.1971.            This relaxation was made after

consultation with the Public Service Commission. It was ordered thus:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_8">       "Government are pleased to order in relaxation of the five year rule

       referred to in para 3(i) and 3(ii) of G.O.(Ms) No.154/71/PD. dated

       27.5.1971 that requests for inter-district transfer of Government

       servants who are dependents relatives of serving soldiers/soldiers

       killed in action or died while on duty in the field/forward areas,

       would be sanctioned in deserving cases, and that the conditions in

       G.O.(Ms) No.4/PD. dated 2.1.1961 regarding seniority will not be

       insisted on in the case of the transferees so that they may be allowed

       to retain their original seniority in the new District."

</blockquote><p id="p_18">The Government by G.O.(Ms) 340/76/PD. dated 29.9.1976 granted the

relaxation in favour of lower ministerial cadres at district level of persons

who have entered into inter caste marriage and this order was also issued in

consultation with the Public Service Commission. It was stipulated that the

W.A.Nos.1466/2006 &amp; 802/2007
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">&amp; W.P.(C) No.26361/2006                12</span>

five year rule stipulated in G.O.(Ms) No.154/71/PD dated 27.5.1971 will

not apply to persons who have entered into inter-caste marriage.

</p><p id="p_19">      13. By G.O.(Ms) 442/80/GAD dated 26.9.1980 it was made clear

that the condition of five year service laid down in the Government Order

dated 27.5.1971 will not be applicable to the candidates who are advised for

appointment in the headquarters vacancies, so that a candidate could get

transfer to the district of his choice without insisting on the period of limit

of five years.    It was also ordered that transfers within the districts

comprised in the erstwhile Malabar and Travancore-Cochin areas will be

allowed within five years subject to other conditions specified. By G.O.(P)

3/82/GAD dated 2.1.1982 a proviso was inserted to Rule 27(a) of KS &amp;

SSR    to protect the seniority of persons advised for appointment in

headquarters vacancies.      In G.O.(Ms) 50/85/GAD dated 25.1.1985 the

Government ordered that          "dependents of Ex-servicemen who were

permanently disabled due to disease or accidents while in active service and

discharged on pension on that account will also be eligible for the

concession of inter-district transfers contemplated        as per   G.O.(Ms)

No.331/76/PD dated 27.9.1976."
</p>
<p id="p_20">      14.    In Circular No.92546/SDI/83/GAD dated             20.5.1985 the

W.A.Nos.1466/2006 &amp; 802/2007
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">&amp; W.P.(C) No.26361/2006                13</span>

Government relaxed the five year rule for inter-district/inter-departmental

transfers, in respect of the members of Last Grade Service, by making it

clear that "the orders are not applicable to them and that they will be

governed by the provisions in Rule 17(d) of the said rules for inter-district

transfer, mutual transfer, etc." Therefore, that is a case where one of the

services itself was excluded from the purview of the Government Order

insisting for five year rule.
</p>
<p id="p_21">       15. The next important circular with regard to the grant of concession

is one issued as per Circular No.476/Adv.C3/88/P&amp;ARD dated 22.2.1988

which granted a further concession to        relatives/dependents of serving

soldiers and relatives/dependents of defence personnel killed in action. It

was made clear that the applications of those seeking inter-district transfer

need not be placed before the Council of Ministers for relaxation of the five

year rule. The dependency of the applicant with the soldier will have to be

verified by the District Collector in such cases.
</p>
<p id="p_22">       16. By G.O.(Ms)12/96/P&amp;ARD dated 16.3.1996 the relaxation of

five year rule was made in the case of transfers to Idukki, Wayanad and

Kasaragod districts.      It was specified     by the said order that the

"Government servants (including Teachers) recruited in other districts will

W.A.Nos.1466/2006 &amp; 802/2007
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">&amp; W.P.(C) No.26361/2006                14</span>

be permitted to be transferred to the Districts of Idukki, Wayanad and

Kasaragod without insisting on completion of five years service in the

original districts of recruitment. This concession will be available only for

getting transfer into these districts, but not for getting transfer out of these

districts and will be granted only once in the career of a Government

servant." As per G.O.(P) No.30/98/P&amp;ARD dated 15.9.1998 it was further

ordered that "inter-district transfers without insisting on completion of five

years service in the original districts of appointments will be permitted

among the Districts of Idukki, Wayanad and Kasaragod. In G.O.(P)

37/96/P&amp;ARD dated 7.11.1996, certain doubts were raised regarding the

question whether the five years spent by a person in the same district in

different departments in the same category of posts could be reckoned for

the purpose of inter-district transfer and whether the stipulation regarding

loss of seniority will be applicable where the seniority is maintained on a

state-wise basis. In paragraph 3, it was clarified as follows:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_9">         "3. Government have examined the matter in detail and are pleased

         to clarify as follows:

<blockquote id="blockquote_10">                (i) A district-wise recruit shall complete five years service

                in the district of recruitment as well as in the department

                 district transfer to another district.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_12">                 (ii) Inter-district transfer of district-wise recruits will result

                 in loss of seniority even in cases where state-wise seniority

                 list is maintained for promotion."</blockquote><p id="p_23">

</p><p id="p_24">      17. The comprehensive Government Order issued with regard to

inter-district transfers of employees by modifying certain conditions in the

various Government Orders, is available in G.O.(P) No.36/91/P&amp;ARD

dated 2.12.1991 (produced as Ext.P1 in writ petition No.11178/2005 and

relied on by the petitioners therein) which was issued in supersession of the

existing orders. It is noted therein that the condition regarding completion

of five years which was imposed from 1971 onwards, was relaxed and

transfers from one district to another within the erstwhile Malabar and

Travancore-Cochin areas were permitted and the five year ban exists at that

point of time only in respect of transfers from a district in Malabar to

Travancore-Cochin area and vice versa. For issuing the above order, the

Government insisted to have modified guidelines, in the light of the fact that

the interest of the rank holders in the PSC lists awaiting advice, will have

to be safeguarded and to avoid any indiscriminate transfers ordered by the

appointing authorities. It was noticed that under the District Recruitment

Scheme, a candidate can choose any one district for the purpose of making

W.A.Nos.1466/2006 &amp; 802/2007
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">&amp; W.P.(C) No.26361/2006                 16</span>

an application and after weighing the interests of the candidates in PSC

rank lists and those who have already secured appointment and seeking

transfer to other districts than those opted by them, in paragraphs 4 to 6 of

the said Government Order the entire scheme was specified with stringent

conditions, as reproduced below:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_13">         "4. Government have weighted the interests of the candidates in

         PSC rank lists and those who have already secured appointment

         seeking transfers to districts other than those opted by them. They

         are of the view that the sanctity of PSC lists have to be protected

         against distortion by indiscriminate transfers of those who have

         already secured appointments, to the detriment of those in PSC

         rank lists. They, therefore, order in supersession of the existing

         orders, that thereafter inter-district transfers will be allowed only

         on the following conditions:--
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_14">                (i) Such transfers will be allowed only after completion of

         five years' service in the district of recruitment.          The only

         exceptions to this rule will be the cases of transfer to the district of

         choice, of candidates advised from district rank lists to

         headquarters vacancies and that of near relatives/dependents of

         service soldiers/soldiers killed in action or died while on duty in

         field/forward areas. Periods of service spent on deputation in a

         different district will not be reckoned as service for this purpose.</blockquote><p id="p_25">

</p><p id="p_26">                (ii) Any inter-district transfer except the one, of candidates

         advised to headquarters vacancies to the district of his choice will

W.A.Nos.1466/2006 &amp; 802/2007

        entail loss of seniority. Service prior to the transfer will count

        towards increment, leave and pension benefits.
</p>
<p id="p_27">        5. Relaxation of the five year rule in very exceptional cases that

        need sympathetic consideration will require the approval of the

        Council of Ministers. Cases should not be proposed for relaxation

        in a routine manner. There should be clear justifying grounds

        supported by the report of the District Collector of the district to

        which transfer is sought for. Proposal for relaxation in such cases

        shall be routed through Chief Secretary

</p><p id="p_28">        6. Only 10% of the vacancies arising in the district in an year in a

        category in a department shall be filled up by inter-district transfer,

        including relaxation cases and cases of near relatives/dependents of

        soldiers."
</p>
<p id="p_29">An analysis of the various Government Orders issued from time to time will

show that relaxations have been permitted only in exceptional cases, as

noticed already, in the case of Army personnel, inter caste marriage people,

etc. The above Government Order insists for approval of the Council of

Ministers when relaxation is granted of the five year rule, in a specific

case, and justifiable grounds had also to be shown and the application will

have to be routed through the Chief Secretary.
</p>
<p id="p_30">      18. The Government had instructed, by issuing various Government

Orders from time to time that the five year rule should be strictly adhered to,

W.A.Nos.1466/2006 &amp; 802/2007
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">&amp; W.P.(C) No.26361/2006                 18</span>

e.g. in Circular No.123746/SD5/73/PD dated 26.5.1976 after noticing that

certain inter-district transfers have been ordered before completing the

prescribed period of five years, the Government directed as follows so as

to strictly observe the five year rule:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_15">          "All Heads of Departments and other Appointing Authorities are

          therefore requested to see that the five year rule prescribed in the

          G.O. first cited for the inter-district/inter-departmental transfer of

          district-wise recruitment is strictly followed in future."

</blockquote><p id="p_31">Again the position was reiterated rather emphatically by issuing Circular

thus:

          the five year rule for transfers are on the increase. The grounds put

          forward are almost identical--family problems, inability to

          maintain two establishments, illness of aged parents etc. If every

          such case is to be treated as 'exception' and inter-district transfers

          allowed in relaxation of the rules, the rules themselves will

          become meaningless and redundant. Government therefore direct

          that such routine representations should not be entertained. Only

          cases which are supported by really exceptional and compelling

          circumstances should be considered for relaxation of rules e.g.

          inter-caste marriages, Harijan employees, near relatives of soldiers

          killed in action/serving soldiers, physically handicapped persons

          etc. All Heads of Departments and Offices and the Departments of

          the Secretariat are requested to bear these aspects in mind while

          forwarding proposals/considering requests, for such transfers."

</blockquote><p id="p_32">Circular No.9036/H2/90/Home dated 7.9.1991 directed the Heads of

Departments to strictly adhere to the above instructions and to avoid any

lapse on this aspect. It was ordered that the responsibility in this regard

will be that of the Head of the Department. Another circular is Circular

No.23033/Adv.C3/91/P&amp;ARD dated 19.12.1991 wherein it was directed

that the instructions in G.O.(P) No.36/91/P&amp;ARD dated 2.12.1991 should

be strictly adhered to and "violation if any shall be viewed seriously and

action taken against the officer ordering the transfer."

</p><p id="p_33">      19. In fact, in the general order containing the guidelines for transfer

of Government employees issued as per G.P.(P) No.15/89/P&amp;ARD dated

22.5.1989, condition No.2(a) incorporates the condition regarding five years

service for inter-district transfer and we extract the same as under:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_17">        "2(a) Subject to the condition regarding 5 years service for inter-

        district transfer applicable to D.R.B. recruits, employees who have

        not completed 3 years of duty/service in a station/district, shall not

        ordinarily be transferred."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_34">The same is also therefore material. The said condition has been retained

W.A.Nos.1466/2006 &amp; 802/2007
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">&amp; W.P.(C) No.26361/2006               20</span>

in all the subsequent orders, revising the guidelines issued as per G.O.(P)

No.13/2000 dated 27.4.2000 and G.P.(P) No.12/04/P&amp;ARD dated

10.9.2004, etc.

</p><p id="p_35">       20. A review of the principles under which these orders are issued,

will show that the prime concern        with regard to the restrictions for

indiscriminate inter-district transfers was to safeguard the interest of the

candidates included in the rank lists of the P.S.C. The availability of

regular employees in various districts       was the other consideration.

Exceptions have been specified in the cases of near relatives/dependents of

serving soldiers/ soldiers killed in action or died while on duty in

field/forward areas. Candidates selected against headquarters vacancies,

were also given the concession, apart from inter-caste married people.

Even though initially certain       posts only were included for district

recruitment, from time to time other posts were added. The order Ext.P1

herein reiterates these principles when the various circulars were

consolidated. It is apposite herein to extract from it the basis for issuance

of the revised order, which are clear from paragraphs 1 to 3. The same are

extracted below:
</p>
<p id="p_36">          "1. While introducing the system of district-wise recruitment to

W.A.Nos.1466/2006 &amp; 802/2007
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">&amp; W.P.(C) No.26361/2006               21</span>

          common category/lower category posts in various departments in

          1971, Government had stipulated that a person recruited from a

          district-wise rank list will not be transferred to another district

          before completion of five years in the district of recruitment and

          that on transfer to the district of his choice, after five years, he

          will take rank as the junior most in the new district. In course of

          time this condition was relaxed and transfers from one district

          to another within the erstwhile Malabar and Travancore-Cochin

          areas were permitted.     The five year ban now exists only in

          respect of transfers from a district in Malabar to Travancore -

          Cochin area and vice versa.
</p>
<p id="p_37">          2.    Government have been receiving many complaints of

          indiscriminate transfers ordered by many appointing authorities to

          the detriment of those in PSC rank lists. It has, therefore become

          necessary to review the existing system with            a view to

          safeguarding the interest of rank holders in PSC lists awaiting

          PSC advice.
</p>
<p id="p_38">          3.   Under the District Recruitment      Scheme a candidate can

          choose any one district for the purpose of making an application.

          A candidate choosing a particular district should therefore, make

          his option carefully and he should be prepared to work in the

          district. Normally, any candidate will choose the district, most

          convenient to him.
</p>
<p id="p_39">

It will show that the Government have been receiving many complaints of

W.A.Nos.1466/2006 &amp; 802/2007
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">&amp; W.P.(C) No.26361/2006               22</span>

indiscriminate transfers ordered by many appointing authorities to the

detriment of those candidates included in the PSC rank lists. As far as the

candidates are concerned, even while applying for the post, they had to

choose the district in the application. Therefore, when such persons who

have opted a particular district are seeking transfers, the restrictions were

thought of, as otherwise it will ruin the sanctity of the list published by the

P.S.C. Such indiscriminate transfers while helping the persons who have

secured appointment, will cause detriment to those included in the rank list.

Such was the concern and anxiety expressed by the Government while

issuing the orders and circulars. Relaxations were also made only in very

exceptional cases for which approval of the Council of Ministers will have

to be obtained.
</p>
<p id="p_40">      21.   In fact, the attempts to make indiscriminate transfers, were

adversely commended upon by this Court in various judgments. We will

now refer to the judgment of a learned Single Judge of this Court (V.

Sivaraman Nair, J.) in K.S. Mini v. Deputy Director of Education,

Ernakulam and others (1984 KLJ 457). The learned Judge was of the

view that inter-district transfers by issuing special orders in total violation

of the guidelines, cannot be accepted. The transfer involved therein relates

W.A.Nos.1466/2006 &amp; 802/2007
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">&amp; W.P.(C) No.26361/2006                 23</span>

to Government school teachers who are also governed by the very same

Government Orders and circulars. After referring to various aspects, the

principles were laid down thus in paragraphs 6, 8 and 9:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_18">         "6. .....Obviously, the Government was issuing orders to all who

         went to it without any reference to the number of vacancies

         available and without any regard to the principles of general

         application evolved by itself to channelise the exercise of power

         relating to inter-district transfer of teachers.

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_19">         8. The Government is of course the ultimate repository of control

         of the teaching staff of the Government Schools and therefore, the

         Government is entitled to oversee the implementation of directions

         relating to inter-district transfers also. But when once instructions

         were issued specifying the guidelines which should govern such

         transfers, it is essential that the Government confines itself to the

         duty of overseeing implementation of such directions instead of

         meddling with each individual case of transfer...............</blockquote><p id="p_41">

</p><p id="p_42">         9. In the present case, it is evident that the three petitioners have

         tried    to  over-reach      the  ordinary    instrumentality in   an

         understandable anxiety to get priority in their favour. They should

         ordinarily have applied to the first respondent for inter district

         transfer. He is expected to order such transfers on the basis of the

         rank among the registered applicants determined with reference to

         orders of uniform application. Obviously, each of the petitioners

         tried to get better of the other applicants and therefore went

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">&amp; W.P.(C) No.26361/2006               24</span>

         straight to the Government to obtain orders of transfer.          The

         Government appears to have willingly obliged, of course without

         considering the relevant facts and        without even pausing to

         consider for a moment the effect of the issue of such orders in

         favour of all persons who approached them................"

</p><p id="p_43">      22. A Division Bench of this Court in <a href="/doc/1601359/" id="a_2">Annamma Joseph v. State

of Kerala</a> (1989 (1) KLT 1), which was heavily relied upon by the learned

Senior Government Pleader, expressed strong reservation with regard to the

attempt to violate the five year rule. The Division Bench consisting of

Malimath C.J. and Bhaskaran Nambiar, J. speaking through Malimath C.J.

(as he then was), held as follows in paragraph 1:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_20">          " The learned single Judge has declined to interfere on the ground

          that the appellant having applied for appointment as Lower

          Division Clerk in Palghat District and having secured

          appointment in that district is ineligible for seeking transfer for a

          period of five years. The learned single Judge took the view that

          the Government order Ext.P2 cannot be understood as having an

          over-riding effect over the relevant order which precludes transfer

          of those appointed on district-wise basis for a period of five years

          to another district. We are inclined to agree with this view of the

          learned single Judge. The rule that those who have been

          appointed on district-wise basis should not be permitted to be

          transferred to another district for a period of five years has a

W.A.Nos.1466/2006 &amp; 802/2007
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">&amp; W.P.(C) No.26361/2006                25</span>

          salutary object to serve for the purpose of ensuring equity in

          the matter of appointment of persons hailing from different

          districts. Appointments are made on district-wise basis where

          selection is confined to those who apply for appointment in that

          particular district. It is a matter of common knowledge that there

          are better prospects for securing selection in certain districts, and

          for this reason persons belonging to another district claim that

          they belong to that district and secure appointment and after

          securing appointment they make every effort to get transfer to the

          district from which they hail. With a view to avoid, such

          unhealthy practice and exploitation the Government have

          imposed restrictions that for a period of five years such persons

          should not ordinarily be transferred. Ext.P2 order which grants

          certain facilities in the matter of transfer of those who undergo

          inter-caste marriages, provides that the employees will invariably

          be accommodated in the same station or near by station

          transferring out other personnel, if necessary, and only where for

          reasons to be recorded such arrangements are impracticable the

          concession will not be applicable. In other words, if there are

          other compelling reasons the facility provided in Ext. P2 need not

          be extended. If, as in this case, applications were called for

          and selection and appointments were made on district-wise

          basis with the further stipulation that they will not ordinarily

          be transferred for a period of five years, the transfer of such

          persons before the expiry of five years must be regarded as

W.A.Nos.1466/2006 &amp; 802/2007
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">&amp; W.P.(C) No.26361/2006                 26</span>

           impracticable or impermissible as the non-transferability of

           such appointees for a period of five years is one of the

           conditions of appointment. We have therefore no hesitation in

           agreeing with the view taken by the learned single Judge that as

           in the case in question, the appointment of the appellant was

           made on a district-wise basis with the stipulation that the

           appointee should not normally be transferred for a period of five

           years the question of claiming the benefit of Ext. P2 as a matter of

           right does not arise. The learned single Judge was therefore

           justified in declining to interfere." (Emphasis supplied)



The Division Bench was of the view that transfer of persons before the

expiry of five years, must be regarded as impermissible. We have already

noticed the various orders issued by the Government insisting for adherence

of the rules.</blockquote><p id="p_44">

</p><p id="p_45">      23. Thus, judged in the light of these principles it can be seen that it

is impermissible to grant inter district transfer within a period of five years

and only in exceptional cases it can be relaxed.
</p>
<p id="p_46">      24. In the light of the scheme available under various Government

Orders which have obtained judicial recognition, we will have to address

the contentions raised by the learned Senior Counsel for the

appellants/petitioners.

<p id="p_47">W.A.Nos.1466/2006 &amp; 802/2007
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">&amp; W.P.(C) No.26361/2006                27</span>

</p><p id="p_48">      25. Learned Senior Counsel, as already noticed, relies upon the first

proviso to Rule 27(a) which reads as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_21">          "Provided that the seniority of persons on mutual or inter-unit or

          inter-departmental transfer from one Unit to another within the

          same Department or from one Department to another, as the case

          may be, on requests from such persons shall be determined with

          reference to the dates of their joining duty in the new Unit or

          Department. In the case of more than one person joining duty

          in the same grade in the same Unit or Department on the same

          date, seniority shall be determined:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_22">          (a) If the persons who join duty belong to different units or

          different departments, with reference to their age, the older being

          considered as senior; and

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_23">          (b) If the persons who join duty belong to the same category of

          post in the same Department, in accordance with their seniority in

          the Unit or Department from which they were transferred."

</blockquote><p id="p_49">The rule as above provides the method of fixing seniority of persons on

mutual or inter-unit or      inter-departmental    transfer within the same

department or from one department to another made on request, and it must

be determined with reference to the dates of their joining duty in the new

unit or department. Plainly, it can be seen that what is envisaged therein is

the principle in fixing the seniority. The proviso does not concern itself with

W.A.Nos.1466/2006 &amp; 802/2007
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">&amp; W.P.(C) No.26361/2006              28</span>

the mode and conditions for inter-unit/inter-district or inter-departmental

transfer. The attempt made by the appellants is to show that the said rule

does not insist for a five year rule so far as the grant of inter-unit/inter-

district transfers are concerned and by relying upon the said rule, the

contention raised is that read along with the Special Rules, they are entitled

to count seniority from the date of joining duty in the new unit or

department. Non-completion of five years in the parent unit is immaterial,

it is contended.
</p>
<p id="p_50">       26. We shall now refer to the relevant provisions of the Special

Rules, viz. Kerala Excise and Prohibition Subordinate Service Rules, 1974.

Rule 7 provides for the "appointing authority" for various categories and

sub-rule (2) provides as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_24">          "7. Appointing authority.-- (1) xxxxxxx

          (2) The appointing authority for categories (2), (3) and (4) shall

          be the Assistant Excise Commissioner in charge of the Divisions

          concerned."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_51">Category 3 is Excise Guards. The appointing authority is the Assistant

Excise Commissioner in charge of the division concerned. Rules 10 and 11

were heavily relied upon by the learned Senior Counsel for the

W.A.Nos.1466/2006 &amp; 802/2007
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_28">&amp; W.P.(C) No.26361/2006              29</span>

appellants/petitioners which are also extracted below:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_25">           "10.   Unit of appointment, discharge and reappointment,

           Seniority and appointment as full member-- For the purposes

           of appointment or reappointment to the service, whether as a full

           member or not, discharge from the service and seniority among

           the members of the service, the State shall be the unit in the case

           of Excise Inspectors and the Excise Divisions shall be units in the

           cases of Excise Preventive Officers, Excise Guards and Drivers.

              Proviso - omitted.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_26">           11. Postings and transfers.-- (1) Postings and transfers of all

           persons appointed to service from one unit to another within an

</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_27">                 (2)   Postings and transfers    from one Excise Zone to

           another Excise Zone and to and from the special unit shall be

           made by the Additional Secretary (Excise), Board of Revenue."



</blockquote><p id="p_52">Rule 10 is important to consider the case of the appellants and heavy

reliance is placed on the same by the learned counsel for the respondents

also. The same provides for a "unit for the purpose of appointment,

discharge and re-appointment and seniority and appointment as full

member" . As far as Excise Guards are concerned, "Excise Divisions" shall

be the unit." Even though it is vehemently contended by the learned Senior

W.A.Nos.1466/2006 &amp; 802/2007
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_29">&amp; W.P.(C) No.26361/2006               30</span>

Counsel for the appellants that Rule 11 is the one governing the postings

and transfers under which the orders Exts.P3 to P5 were issued, evidently

the same confers power on a specified officer to issue the orders of posting

and transfer and the scope of the provision is not the one concerning the

principles governing transfer itself.     The argument therefore that the

transfers made herein are under the mode prescribed as per Rule 11 and the

same alone will govern the matter, cannot be accepted.

</p><p id="p_53">       27. The reliance placed on the decision of the Apex Court in

Sudhakaran's case (2006 (2) KLT 817 - SC) also cannot help the

appellants. Rule 27(a) and (c) of KS &amp; SSR came up for interpretation

therein. The facts of the case     will show that the post involved is LDC

(Lower Division Clerk) in different districts. The unit of recruitment was

the district therein.   After recruitment some of the appointees were

transferred to other districts on request.  Later, the question of fixing the

seniority arose. When the seniority list was published, the seniority of

transferred LDCs were shown        in the list with reference to the dates of

their first appointment and not with reference to the dates of their joining in

the district to which they were transferred on their own request. The

Division Bench, while disposing of the matter, took the view that the

W.A.Nos.1466/2006 &amp; 802/2007
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_30">&amp; W.P.(C) No.26361/2006              31</span>

Government Order dated 2.1.1961 and Rule 27 provides for fixing the

seniority only from the date of their joining duty at the District to which,

they were transferred on their own request, but it was held that as the

seniority list was finalised in 1984, the position of the transferred LDCs

should not be disturbed and it was further held that the provisions of the

Government Order dated 2.1.1961 and the proviso to Rule 27(a) should be

given effect only prospectively. The Apex Court did not agree with the

above view. In para 14, the legal position was explained thus:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_28">         "14. The transferred LDCs. (contesting private respondents)

         contended that the GO dated 27.5.1971 stated that it will not affect

         the existing procedure where State-wise promotions are involved.

         They point out that though the posts of LDCs. are District-wise, as

         the promotion of LDCs to UDCs is State-wise, the provisions of

         G.O. dated 2.1.1961 will not apply, in view of clause (iv) of G.O.

         dated 27.5.1971. It is unnecessary to examine whether clause (iv)

         of G.O. dated 27.5.1971 excludes the applicability of G.O. dated

         2.1.1961, as neither the G.O. dated 27.5.1971 nor the G.O. dated

         2.1.1961 governed the effect of 'own request' transfers, after Rule

         27(a) of the Service Rules was amended by introducing a proviso

         providing for the consequences of 'own request' transfers. Where

         Statutory Rules govern the field, prior executive instructions cease

         to apply."

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_31">&amp; W.P.(C) No.26361/2006              32</span>

Shri P. Ravindran, learned Senior Counsel for the appellants placed heavy

reliance on the said paragraph to contend that after the proviso to Rule 27

was amended, the executive instructions will not apply.

</p><p id="p_55">      28. A reading of the principles therein only show that the Apex Court

held that the principle under Rule 27(a) proviso will apply in fixing the

seniority of the transferred LDCs. Evidently, in the said case it can be seen

that persons concerned were transferred after their appointment under the

relevant orders. Therefore, their position in the seniority list after such

transfer was the matter which arose for consideration and it was held that

the proviso to Rule 27(a) will apply. We do not agree with the contention

of the learned Senior Counsel for the appellants that whatever may be the

mode of transfer, the dictum laid down therein should be understood as one

laying down that the seniority will have to be fixed from the date of joining

the new unit. Evidently it was a case of regular inter-district transfer, and

no contest was there with regard to the transfers made and the principle for

fixing seniority was thus laid down.        The facts emerging herein are

altogether different.
</p>
<p id="p_56">      29. One of the points raised by the learned Senior Counsel for the

appellants is that the appointment in the Excise Department is on division

W.A.Nos.1466/2006 &amp; 802/2007
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_32">&amp; W.P.(C) No.26361/2006               33</span>

basis and therefore the orders/circulars regarding inter-district transfer will

not apply. This is answered by the learned Senior Government Pleader and

learned counsel appearing for the contesting respondents by pointing out

that as far as Excise Department also is concerned, the recruitment is

district-wise and a division is equivalent to a Revenue district. Learned

Senior Government Pleader          made available the Government Order

showing the details of the divisions and contended that as far as the State is

concerned, there are 14 divisions equalling the total number of 14 Revenue

districts. Apart from that, the notification issued by the Public Service

Commission     which was published in the        Gazette dated 20.12.1983,

inviting applications for the post of Excise Guards, has also been placed for

perusal. Therein, column No.4 gives the number of vacancies district-wise

and Notes (1) (2) and (3) are also important. We extract column No.4

Note (1) shows that separate ranked lists will be prepared for each district.

not be sent to more than one District and Note (3) is important for

considering the contentions herein also. It is clearly specified therein that

selections made are on a Revenue District basis. Note (3) shows that a

candidate advised for appointment in one         Revenue District from the

ranked list prepared is not eligible for transfer to another District unless he

completes 5 years continuous service from the date of commencement of

service in the former District. Such transfer, even if allowed after five

years, will be subject to the rules in G.O.(Ms) No.4/PD dated 2.1.1961.

W.A.Nos.1466/2006 &amp; 802/2007
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_35">&amp; W.P.(C) No.26361/2006                36</span>

Therefore, it is now beyond the point to contend that as far as Excise

Department is concerned, a division is different from a district and the

appointment is not district-wise and therefore the Government Orders like

Ext.P1 and the earlier Government Orders prescribing the guidelines for

inter-district transfer and the principles thereon will not apply to the Excise

Department. In fact, the Division Bench in W.A. No.1505/2006             in the

judgment, noticed the fact that the appointment is district-wise as far as

Excise Department is concerned, in paragraph 5. The relevant portion is

extracted below:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_32">         "Of course, in Excise department, division is the unit unlike other

         departments. But the divisions are for each district. Recruitment to

         the category of Excise Guard is on district basis as conducted by

         the Kerala Public Service Commission. Necessarily, the division

         for the purpose of excise department is confined to each revenue

         districts. Therefore, going by Ext.P1, one can be transferred from

         the district in which he has been recruited to another district of his

         choice only after completion of five years. Before that he does not

         have any entitlement for such transfer with lien to the district of

         choice."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_60">Thus, evidently for the purpose of applying Rule 10 of the Special Rules,

the unit of appointment will be district itself. Hence, it can be safely

W.A.Nos.1466/2006 &amp; 802/2007
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_36">&amp; W.P.(C) No.26361/2006               37</span>

concluded that as far as Excise Department also is concerned, inter-district

transfer will be governed by the provisions of various orders including

Ext.P1 Government Order of the year 1991 and thus all the conditions

prescribed will apply.
</p>
<p id="p_61">      31. The next aspect is whether the Government Order runs contrary

to the proviso to Rule 27(a). Evidently, the proviso to Rule 27(a) concerns

the principle for fixing the seniority alone and it does not govern the

conditions for grant of inter-district/inter-unit transfer. Matters which are

not covered by the rules can         clearly    be brought in by executive

instructions, which legal position is well settled.

</p><p id="p_62">      32. The Apex Court had occasion to reiterate the said principle in

<a href="/doc/753100/" id="a_3">Pankajakshan Nair v. Jayaraj</a> (2001 (2) KLT 141 - SC), when a similar

argument was raised. The facts of the case show that before the statutory

recruitment rules came into force, an administrative order was in force and

it provided that in the category of DYSP in the local police, not more than

one out of eight vacancies should be filled up by transfer from amongst

Assistant Commandants of District Armed Reserve and Armed Police

Battalion. The statutory rules provides the method of appointment from

three different sources, viz. (a) by direct recruitment; or (b) by promotion

W.A.Nos.1466/2006 &amp; 802/2007
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_37">&amp; W.P.(C) No.26361/2006                 38</span>

from amongst Circle Inspectors; or (c) appointment from amongst Second

Commandants, Adjutants and Assistant Commandant, M.S.P. and Special

Armed Police Battalions and Assistant District Armed Reserve.              The

appellant before the Apex Court was an Assistant Commandant in the

District Armed Service Force under category (c). The argument was based

on the executive instructions earmarking not more than one out of eight

vacancies to be filled up by transfer from Assistant Commandants, etc. and

that it still governs the field, being not inconsistent with the rule. The Apex

Court Court answered the question in paragraph 8 thus:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_33">             " 8. It is undisputed that the executive order issued in the year

             1962, still continues to remain in force, being amended from time

             to time but the relevant Clause of that executive order contained

             in Clause (d) has not been touched. The statutory Rules which

             came into force on 14th of June, 1966, no doubt stipulates that it

             is in supersession of the Rules and orders on the subject.

             Necessarily therefore, if the statutory Rules provide any

             provision corresponding to Clause (d) of the executive

             instructions, then the said executive instruction must give way.</blockquote><p id="p_63">

</p><p id="p_64">             But if the statutory Rules are silent on the same and there is

             no provision which can be held to be contrary to the executive

             instructions, then the executive instructions will continue to

             operate in the field for which there is no provision in the

W.A.Nos.1466/2006 &amp; 802/2007
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_38">&amp; W.P.(C) No.26361/2006                39</span>

           statutory Rules. The executive instructions must be held to

           be supplemental to the statutory Rules." (Emphasis supplied)



It was noted that the statutory rules are silent on clause (d) of the executive

instructions and therefore there is nothing in the statutory rules which is

contrary to the executive instructions and the executive instructions will

continue to operate in the field for which there is no provision in the

statutory rules. In paragraph 9 it was further held thus:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_34">           "9. Having examined the provisions of the recruitment Rules of

           1966 as well as the executive instructions of the year 1962, we

           are unable to find any provision in the statutory Rules which can

           be said to be repugnant to the earlier executive order. That

           apart, the said executive order continues to remain in force by

           various amendments, though the very Clause has not been

           amended. In this view of the matter, the executive order of 1962

           must be held to be continuing in force and remains

           operative. ........."</blockquote><p id="p_65">

</p><p id="p_66">      33. Similar is the position herein also. When proviso was added to

Rule 27(a), what is taken care of is only the principle regarding seniority.

The same was added by G.O.(P) 11/76/PD dated 13.1.1976. It is not as if

as far as inter-district transfer and its principles are concerned, the proviso

will govern. We cannot agree with the submission that the introduction of

W.A.Nos.1466/2006 &amp; 802/2007
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_39">&amp; W.P.(C) No.26361/2006                  40</span>

the proviso nullifies all that is covered by the executive orders                and

circulars. There is no provision therein contrary to what is provided under

the proviso to Rule 27(a). Therefore, it cannot be said that Ext.P1 order

runs contrary to the plain terms of the proviso to Rule 27(a).

</p><p id="p_67">      34. In fact, another vehement contention raised by the learned Senior

Counsel for the appellants/petitioners is that as far as Excise Department is

concerned, the Special Rules alone will govern and therefore the executive

orders including Ext.P1 will govern persons who are not covered by the

Special Rules. We have noted Rule 11 of the Special Rules already. It only

specifies the authority who is empowered to issue posting and transfer

orders. The orders of transfer, therefore will have to be issued under the

general guidelines of transfer prescribed by the Government from time to

time and the inter-district/inter-unit       transfers will be governed by the

principles and conditions provided in Ext.P1 and other relevant orders and

circulars. It is not as if an inter-district transfer like the one herein, is issued

under Rule 11. The said argument is therefore rejected.

</p><p id="p_68">      35. In this context, learned Government Pleader relied upon the

principles stated by the Apex Court in <a href="/doc/627069/" id="a_4">Dhananjay Malik v. State of

Uttaranchal</a> (2008 (2) KLT 969 - SC) to show that the Government can

W.A.Nos.1466/2006 &amp; 802/2007
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_40">&amp; W.P.(C) No.26361/2006               41</span>

maintain administrative instructions when the rules are silent on           any

particular point. In paragraph 14, it is held as follows:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_35">         "Government cannot amend or supersede statutory rules by

         administrative instructions, but if the rules are silent on any

         particular point Government can fill up the gaps and supplement

         the rules and issue instructions not inconsistent with the rules

         already framed."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_69">Learned Government Pleader further relied upon the principles stated by a

Division Bench of this Court in <a href="/doc/1905142/" id="a_5">Regi v. State of Kerala</a> (2010 (2) KLT

</p><p id="p_70">265) to contend for the position that the power for issuing various orders

governing inter-district transfer can be traced to Rule 39 of the general

rules of KS &amp; SSR and therefore they are having statutory recognition. In

fact, the Division Bench (consisting of K. Balakrishnan Nair (as he then

was) and P. N. Ravindran, JJ.) in the said decision, has clearly held that the

orders permitting inter-district transfers are issued under Rule 39. K.

Balakrishnan Nair, J. (as he then was) speaking for the Bench in Regi's case

(supra) in paragraph 5 held as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_36">         "5.   The next contention raised is that the only method of

         appointment available for appointment to the District Armed

         Reserve is through transfer from the members of the Armed Police

         Battalion. But the orders permitting inter-district transfer are orders

W.A.Nos.1466/2006 &amp; 802/2007
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_41">&amp; W.P.(C) No.26361/2006              42</span>

         issued under R.39 of the General Rules of the K.S. &amp; S.S.R. The

         said Rule confers power on the Government to issue appropriate

         orders, notwithstanding anything contained in the Special Rules or

         the General Rules. Inter-unit and inter-district transfers have been

         permitted since 1961 under the order of the Government G.O.(MS)

         No.4/61/PD     dated   02.01.1961.    It  appears,    recently,  the

         Government have imposed a restriction on the percentage of

         vacancies to which inter-district transfers can be ordered. That is,

         orders have been issued to safe-guard the interests of the

         candidates included in the PSC list, awaiting appointment. We are

         of the view that the Government have power to permit inter-district

         transfer and the general orders governing the same are valid,

         notwithstanding anything contained in the Special Rules. So, the

         contention of the petitioners that inter-district transfer is

         impermissible in the light of the provisions of the Special Rules,

         cannot be accepted."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_71">The said discussion will show that the power conferred under Rule 39 is

notwithstanding anything contained in the Special Rules or the general

rules and therefore the Government have got power to permit inter-district

transfer invoking the provisions of the Government Orders in the matter.

In fact, the Bench was also of the view that these orders are issued to

safeguard the interests of the candidates included in the PSC list, awaiting

appointment. The same is also significant. Hence, for all these reasons, the

W.A.Nos.1466/2006 &amp; 802/2007
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_42">&amp; W.P.(C) No.26361/2006                43</span>

Special Rules herein cannot advance the case of the appellants.

</p><p id="p_72">       36. We are therefore of the view that the contention that the circulars

and executive orders will go against Rule 27(a) and the proviso, cannot hold

good. The transfer orders issued herein, as already noticed, are with a

condition that for the purpose of appointment, re-appointment, seniority etc.

the unit to which they were appointed originally, shall continue. This is

significant. The appellants therefore retained their lien in the parent units.

Therefore, it cannot be treated as a transfer inter-district or inter-unit in the

exact terms. The argument that violation, if any, of the condition provided

under Ext.P1, of the five year rule will not be material as no consequences

are provided therein, also therefore cannot hold good.           The principles

governing the grant of inter-district transfer will show that the general norm

is that it can be granted only after completion of five years of service in the

district opted by the appointee. Exceptional cases we have already noticed.

The appellants/petitioners do not come within any of the exceptional cases.

Even with regard to transfer in exceptional cases, the same also shall be

done by the approval of the Council of Ministers, which is also not

available here. Therefore, going by the dictum laid down in Annamma

Joseph,s case (1989 (1) KLT 1) such transfers can only be held to be

W.A.Nos.1466/2006 &amp; 802/2007
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_43">&amp; W.P.(C) No.26361/2006                44</span>

impermissible.     Learned Government Pleader submitted that when the

petitioners are beneficiaries of such an illegal order, they cannot claim

seniority over the appointees in the new unit which goes against the

conditions provided in Ext.P1 and other Government Orders.

</p><p id="p_73">      37. In our considered view, the absence of any consequences in the

executive orders cannot be a guiding factor to find out whether the orders

could be supported for giving seniority to the petitioners, even if the five

year rule is violated. That five year rule is the important aspect as far as

inter-district transfer is concerned, cannot admit of any doubt. Violations of

the same cannot get any justification or legal foundation. As we have

already discussed, all the Government Orders and general directions issued

by the Government from time to time, wanted to have strict adherence to the

five year rule. Therefore, the said contention also can only be rejected.

Apart from that, the conditions in the Gazette notification under which the

appellants/petitioners could submit applications for appointment, clearly

provided under Note (3) that "inter-district transfer can be obtained only

after putting five years service in the unit". The same also will go against

the contentions of the appellants/petitioners as non-transferability is a

condition for appointment.
</p>
<p id="p_74">W.A.Nos.1466/2006 &amp; 802/2007
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_44">&amp; W.P.(C) No.26361/2006               45</span>

</p><p id="p_75">       38. The next aspect is whether the appellants/petitioners are retaining

their lien in the unit to which they were appointed or in the unit to which

they are transferred the moment the transfers were effected. In fact, the

contention raised by the learned Senior Counsel, Shri P. Ravindran is that

the transfer of the lien is automatic. Shri P.V. Mohanan, learned counsel

appearing for the party respondents contended otherwise, by relying upon

the decision of a Full Bench of this Court in Balakrishnan Nair v. Ram

Mohan Nair (1998 (1) KLT 766 - FB (consisting of Mrs. K.K. Usha, K.S.

Radhakrishnan and S. Sankarasubban, JJ.). That was also a case where the

effect of the various rules under Part I K.S.R. relating to acquisition of lien,

suspension and cancellation were considered.          The Full Bench, after

considering various aspects including Rule 8 of KS &amp; SSR,             speaking

through S. Sankarasubban, J., laid down the principle thus in para 26:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_37">           "26. Thus, on the basis of the above decisions and the relevant

           Rules in the KSR and K.S.S.R., we are of the view that the lien of

           a member of a service to a post in the parent Department is not

           lost automatically when he joins another Department. The lien can

           be terminated only after hearing the concerned person. By mere

           completion of probation it cannot be said that a person has been

           substantively appointed to a permanent post. Unless a person is

           confirmed under R. 24 of K.S.S.R., it cannot be said that the

W.A.Nos.1466/2006 &amp; 802/2007
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_45">&amp; W.P.(C) No.26361/2006              46</span>

          person has been substantively appointed to a permanent post. In

          the present case, we find that the appellants have not been

          confirmed in the Co-operative Department. Hence they have no

          lien in the Co-operative Department. Their lien in the Rural

          Development Department has not been terminated. In that view of

          the matter, sending them back to the parent Department is legal."

</blockquote><p id="p_76">The same principles will apply herein. Therefore, merely because a person

joins another unit or another department, the lien in the unit of appointment

is not lost automatically. In fact, the relevant rules of Part I of K.S.R.

which have been referred to by the learned counsel for the party

respondents, throw light on this aspect. Under Rule 12(18), 'lien' is defined

as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_38">         "(18) Lien-- Means the title of an Officer to hold substantively,

         either immediately or on termination of a period or periods of

         absence, a permanent post to which he has been appointed

         substantively."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_77">Rules   16 to 19 are relevant for the purpose of this case, which are

reproduced below:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_39">         "16. Unless in any case it be otherwise provided in these rules, an

         officer on substantive appointment         to any permanent post

substantively a permanent post retains his lien. It is provided that unless

his lien is suspended under Rule 18 or transferred under Rule 20 an officer

holding substantively a permanent post retains a lien on that post. Rule 18

confers power on the Government to suspend the lien and Rule 19(a)

provides that "an Officer's lien on a post may in no circumstances be

terminated, even with his consent, if the result will be to leave him without

a lien or a suspended lien upon a permanent post" and finally, Rule 20

         transfer to another permanent post in the same cadre the lien of an

         Officer who is not performing the duties of the post to which the

         lien relates, even if that lien has been suspended."

</blockquote><p id="p_89">Therefore,     there is no automatic transfer of lien as contended by the

appellants herein. In this context, the condition provided in the various

orders, Exts.P4 and P5 that they will retain their position in the parent unit

for the purpose of appointment, discharge and reappointment, seniority, etc.

is therefore important and thus they retained their lien in the parent division

itself even after the transfer.
</p>
<p id="p_90">       40. The learned Senior Counsel for the appellants, Shri P. Ravindran

relied upon the principles stated by the Apex Court in <a href="/doc/374386/" id="a_6">Smt. Tarulata Syam

and others v. The Commissioner of Income Tax, West Bengal</a> (AIR

1977 SC 1802), <a href="/doc/520092/" id="a_7">DDA and others v. Joginder S. Monga and others</a>

{(2004) 2 SCC 297} and           <a href="/doc/1260341/" id="a_8">Union of India and another v. Central

Electrical &amp; Mechanical Engineering Service (CE&amp; MES) Group 'A'

(Director Recruitments) Assn. CPWD and others</a> {(2008) 1 SCC 354} in

support of his pleas.    The argument in a nutshell is that the Court cannot

supply words to a statute and executive instructions cannot go against the

W.A.Nos.1466/2006 &amp; 802/2007
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_49">&amp; W.P.(C) No.26361/2006               50</span>

statutory rules.
</p>
<p id="p_91">       41. In Tarulata's case (AIR 1977 SC 1802) in paragraph 33, it was

held that "even if there be a causus omissus, the defect can be remedied

only by legislation and not by judicial interpretation." This principle is thus

well settled. But as far as the present situation is concerned, as we have

already noticed, this is a case wherein the executive orders like Ext.P1 and

the proviso to Rule 27(a) operate in different fields, and therefore the

situation is dissimilar. Therefore, it is not a case where the question of

importing into the statute, words which are not there, arises and the said

principle cannot have any application herein.
</p>
<p id="p_92">       42. In DDA's case {(2004) 2 SCC 297}, in paragraphs 35 and 36 the

Apex Court referred to the principles laid down in two earlier decisions of

the Court in <a href="/doc/1320680/" id="a_9">Sant Ram Sharma v. State of Rajasthan</a> (AIR 1967 SC 1910)

and <a href="/doc/1789036/" id="a_10">State of M.P. v. G.S. Dall &amp; Flour Mills</a> (1992 Supp.(1) SCC 150),

which are reproduced hereunder:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_44">         "35. In Sant Ram (AIR 1967 SC 1910), this Court has categorically

         stated: (AIR p.1914 para 7)

               "It is true that Government cannot amend or supersede
               statutory rules by administrative instructions, but if the rules
               are silent on any particular point, Government can fill up the
               gaps and supplement the rules and issue instructions not
               inconsistent with the rules already framed."

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_50">&amp; W.P.(C) No.26361/2006               51</span>

</p><p id="p_94">          36. Yet again in G.S. Dall &amp; Flour Mills ((1992 Supp.(1) SCC

</p><p id="p_95">          150) this Court observed as under (SCC p. 174. para 19)

               "Executive instructions can supplement a statute or cover
               areas to which the statute does not extend. But they cannot
               run contrary to statutory provisions or whittle down their
               effect."
</p>
<p id="p_96">In fact, we have already referred to the similar principles stated in

Pankajakshan Nair's case (2001 (2) KLT 141 - SC). The principles stated

in all these decisions will show that executive instructions will govern

wherever statutory rules are silent. To the same effect is the dictum laid

down in paragraph 10 of Central Electrical &amp; Mechanical Engineering

Service (CE&amp; MES) Group 'A' (Director Recruitments) Assn.'s case

{(2008) 1 SCC 354}, that the power of the State Government to issue

executive instructions, is confined to filling up of the gaps or covering the

area which otherwise has not been covered by the existing rules. Learned

Senior Counsel for the appellants/petitioners also relied upon various

decisions    in support of the plea that a literal interpretation is required.

There cannot be any application of those principles herein, as we have

already held that the orders herein operate in different fields not covered by

the statutory rules and as held by the Division Bench of this Court in Regi's

case (2010 (2) KLT 265),         Rule 39 of KS &amp; SSR            empowers the

W.A.Nos.1466/2006 &amp; 802/2007
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_51">&amp; W.P.(C) No.26361/2006               52</span>

Government to issue such orders notwithstanding anything contained in the

Special Rules or the general rules.
</p>
<p id="p_97">      43. Therefore, going by the stipulations in various executive orders

including Ext.P1 any transfer, inter-unit or inter-district-wise, will have to

be substantively with the lien after a period of five years. The instances of

relaxation are minimum and even in the case of relaxation it will have to be

done by the Council of Ministers. Rule 27(a) of KS &amp; SSR prescribes the

principle wherein seniority can be reckoned when appointments are made

otherwise than on the advice by the Public Service Commission. The first

proviso provides for fixation of seniority of persons on mutual or inter-unit

or inter-departmental transfer from one unit to another, etc. The provisions

of KSR and that of KS &amp; SSR when considered together, will show that as

far as determination of permanent cadre is concerned, it will have to be

done by the Government in respect of each service, class, category and

grade. (Rule 2(18) of KS &amp; SSR). In fact, the definition of 'cadre' in Rule

12(4) of Part I K.S.R. means "the strength of a service or part of the

service sanctioned as a separate unit". A "member of service" means "a

person who has been appointed to that service and who has not retired or

resigned, been removed or dismissed, been substantively transferred or

W.A.Nos.1466/2006 &amp; 802/2007
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_52">&amp; W.P.(C) No.26361/2006                 53</span>

reduced to another service, or been discharged otherwise than for want of a

vacancy".     (Rule 2(9) of KS &amp; SSR).               The words "substantively

transferred" are quite important. We have already discussed Rules 16 to 20

of Part I K.S.R. providing for termination, transfer of lien, etc. Therefore,

only if a person is substantively transferred with lien alone, he can be

considered to have been transferred to the other unit. Unless and until the

lien is transferred for various purposes including seniority, the transferees

will have to be treated as borne       in the parent unit itself. They can get

seniority in the transferred unit only if the lien gets transferred in terms of

the rules and eligibility for inter-district transfer can be acquired only after

five years service in the district of appointment, based on which they can

get seniority in the transferred units. Therefore, clearly it is a case where

the persons like the appellants will not get seniority based on the present

orders of transfer on completion of five years in the unit of appointment

without a substantive transfer with lien, which alone could have enabled

them for assignment of seniority under the proviso to Rule 27(a) of KS &amp;

SSR. The general power of transfer conferred under Rule 32 of KS &amp; SSR

will also show that a "member of a service" or class of a service may be

required to serve in a post borne on the cadre of such service or class. The

W.A.Nos.1466/2006 &amp; 802/2007
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_53">&amp; W.P.(C) No.26361/2006               54</span>

provisions of Rule 8 of KS &amp; SSR are also important here and it will show

that for all purposes of getting the service benefits to a person the parent

cadre is important. Rule 8 enables a 'member of service' who is absent from

duty in such service to return back to that service if he is not otherwise

ineligible, as held by the Full Bench in Balakrishnan Nair's case (supra).

Therefore, when the appellants were transferred without transfer of lien,

their rights are retained in the parent unit itself which includes seniority.

Rule 10 of the Special Rules herein, as already mentioned, states that for the

purpose of appointment, discharge and reappointment, seniority and

appointment as a full member, the Excise division shall be the unit. Herein,

the Excise division is equivalent to a revenue district. In that view of the

matter, the appellants cannot get seniority as claimed by them based on

Exts.P3 to P5 in the new division.           Since the appellants were not

transferred with their lien, it cannot be treated as an inter-unit transfer in

strict sense and at any point of time they were liable to be transferred to the

parent division.
</p>
<p id="p_98">       44. The learned Single Judge (K. Balakrishnan Nair, J. as he then

was), in the common judgment, was of the explicit view that "Exts.P1 and

P2 deal with inter-unit/district transfer, which is not covered by the

W.A.Nos.1466/2006 &amp; 802/2007
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_54">&amp; W.P.(C) No.26361/2006                 55</span>

statutory Rules. Rule 27(a) deals with the reckoning of seniority of an

incumbent on his regular appointment to that unit, otherwise than on the

advice of the Public Service Commission. The first proviso thereof deals

with regular inter-unit/district transfer. In this case, the inter-unit transfer

ordered before completion of 5 years' service is illegal. So, the decision of

the Apex Court relied on by the party respondents has no application to the

facts of the case."
</p>
<p id="p_99">      45. The Division Bench of this Court, while dismissing Writ Appeal

No.1505/2006 arising from the same common judgment, speaking through

K.A. Abdul Gafoor, J. succinctly put the relevant principles in para 6 as

hereunder:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_45">          "True, as per proviso to Rule 27(a), a person transferred from the

          one district to another district, on request, is entitled to reckon

          seniority from the date of joining in the transferee district. That

          can only when such transfer is ordered as per Ext.P1 with transfer

          of lien for the purpose of seniority. But Exts.P4 and P5 transfer

          containing the specific conditions as extracted supra does not give

          them the benefit to reckon seniority in the transferee district.</blockquote><p id="p_100">

</p><p id="p_101">          These transfers were not ordered as per Ext.P1. It cannot also be

          considered as the inter unit transfer in terms of the proviso to Rule

          27(a) because of the specific condition in Exts.P4 and P5 transfer

          orders to the effect that, for the purpose of seniority they could be

W.A.Nos.1466/2006 &amp; 802/2007
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_55">&amp; W.P.(C) No.26361/2006                  56</span>

          regarded as incumbents in the respective district of initial

          recruitment.   Therefore it cannot be termed as a transfer for the

          purpose of reckoning seniority as contemplated in the proviso to

          Rule 27(a) or that to be ordered in terms of Ext.P1. Rule 27(a)

          does not govern inter district/unit transferees, as         such, as

          contended by the appellants. It governs only the seniority of the

          incumbent so transferred."
</p>
<p id="p_102">We respectfully endorse the said view.
</p>
<p id="p_103">      46. We may add here, further that, they had no grievance about the

crucial conditions in Exts.P4 and P5 at any point of time. They continued

after such transfer by retaining their lien in the parent divisions. Eight of

them were included in the provisional seniority list Ext.P8 in Kannur

District itself being their district of recruitment. Thereafter, appellant No.5

filed a representation to the first respondent claiming seniority in Excise

Division, Palakkad and pursuant to the direction issued by this Court in

O.P.No.34292/2001 to consider the representation, the Joint             Excise

Commissioner, heard the matter and issued Ext.P10 proceedings to include

his name in the seniority list of Excise Guards in Palakkad Division with

effect from the date on which he joined at Palakkad Division and gave

seniority from that date. He had completed only less than 3 months in

Kannur Division, at the time of transfer. Again, by Ext.P11 direction was

W.A.Nos.1466/2006 &amp; 802/2007
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_56">&amp; W.P.(C) No.26361/2006               57</span>

issued to the Assistant Excise Commissioner to obtain option from those

Excise Guards who were transferred either to continue in Kannur or to

remain in the District to which they wore transferred, within three days.

Finally, by Ext.P12 directions were issued to include the remaining of them

in the final seniority list in the transferred district. Thus, options were

called for after a long number of years and this exercise is unknown to the

scheme of inter-district transfer. They were never given any relaxation by

a decision of the Council of Ministers also. Therefore, the exercise done is

clearly one in perpetuation of an illegality. If that be so, they cannot get

seniority before five years which is the rule as far as regular inter-district

transfers are concerned. If the transfer is effected before five years, and

without getting an order of relaxation from the five year rule the seniority

claimed in the transferred unit/district based on the order of transfer, cannot

be granted.
</p>
<p id="p_104">      47. In that view of the matter and on the facts as explained above, it

can be seen that the appellants cannot get any right at all.    Therefore, we

respectfully agree with the view taken by the           Division     Bench in

W.A. No.1505/2006 and reaffirm the same.         The reference is answered

accordingly.

<p id="p_105">     For all these reasons, the  Writ Appeals and the Writ Petition are

dismissed. No costs.
