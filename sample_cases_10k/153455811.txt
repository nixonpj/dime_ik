<pre id="pre_1">IN THE COURT OF SH. KAMLESH KUMAR; AD&amp;SJ(CENTRAL)-17,DELHI


Suit No. 469/08


HDFC Bank Ltd                                                  .......Plaintiff

                                  Versus

Indus Airways Pvt. Ltd                                      .......Defendant


ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">            This order will dispose of the contention of ld counsel for the

respondent that this court has no territorial jurisdiction to entertain the

present petition filed by the petitioner HDFC Bank Ltd.

</p><p id="p_2">2)    Ld counsel for the respondent Indus Airways Pvt Ltd has argued

that as per the loan-cum-hypothecation agreement executed between the

parties, it was agreed that venue of arbitration proceedings shall be

Mumbai and therefore neither the arbitration proceedings can be

initiated at Delhi nor this court can entertain the petition. Ld counsel for

the petitioner, on the other hand, submitted that the loan cum

hypothecation agreement was executed at Delhi, the registered office of

the respondent Indus Airways Pvt Ltd is at Delhi and the petitioner Bank

has one of its office at Delhi and therefore, this court has jurisdiction to

entertain the petition.
</p>
<p id="p_3">

</p><p id="p_4">3)    I have considered the submissions made by the ld counsel for the

parties and have carefully gone through the record.




</p><p id="p_5">                                  -- 1 --
</p><p id="p_6"> 4)    The       respondent   Indus   Airways     Pvt.   Ltd    got   a   loan   for

Rs.9,53,629/- for purchase of a TATA LP 1512 TC in the year 2006 from

the petitioner HDFC Bank Ltd, under its loan-cum-hypothecation

scheme.     A    loan-cum-hypothecation        agreement      was    executed   on

23.12.2006 at New Delhi. Clause 24 of the said loan-cum-hypothecation

agreement provided as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">      24. Except where it has been provided otherwise, any
      dispute or difference arising out or in connection with the
      present agreement between the parties including any dispute
      of difference relating to the interpretation of the agreement or
      any clause thereof shall be referred to sole arbitration of, or of
      a person appointed by Regional Product Heard Delhi and the
      provisions of the arbitration and conciliation Act, 1996 and
      rules thereunder and any amendment thereto from time to
      time shall apply. No objection shall be taken on the ground
      that arbitrator so appointed is an employee of the bank or is in
      any way associated with the bank. The award of arbitrator
      shall be final, conclusive and binding on all the parties. The
      arbitrator shall be competent to decide whether any matter of
      dispute of difference referred to him falls within the purview of
      arbitration as provided for above and/or for any matter
      relating to arbitration under the Arbitration and <a href="/doc/1306164/" id="a_1">Conciliation
      Act</a>, 1996. The venue of the arbitration proceeding shall be at
      Mumbai.
</blockquote>


<p id="p_7">5)     The law on the point of territorial jurisdiction is now well settled

by the several authoritative pronouncements of the Apex Court.

(Reference may be had to (1993)2 SC 130, 2007(8) SUPREME 442].

</p><p id="p_8">      Sections 16 to 20 of the Code deal with territorial jurisdiction of a

Court. Whereas <a href="/doc/675839/" id="a_2">Sections 16</a> to <a href="/doc/1347069/" id="a_3">18</a> relate to immovable property, suits for

compensation for wrongs to persons or movables have been dealt with

under <a href="/doc/1731368/" id="a_4">Section 19</a>. Section 20 of the Code is a residuary provision and

covers all cases not falling under <a href="/doc/675839/" id="a_5">Sections 16</a> to <a href="/doc/1731368/" id="a_6">19</a>.

</p><p id="p_9">                                     -- 2 --
</p><p id="p_10">       The relevant part of <a href="/doc/385194/" id="a_7">Section 20</a> reads thus:
</p><p id="p_11">              (20) Other suits to be instituted where Defendants
      reside or cause of action arises. Subject to the limitations
      aforesaid, every suit shall be instituted in a Court within the
      local limits of whose jurisdiction -
</p><p id="p_12">              (a)   The Defendant, or each of the Defendants
      where there are more than one, at the time of the
      commencement of the suit, actually and voluntarily resides,
      or carries on business, or personally woks for gain; or
</p><p id="p_13">              (b)   any of the Defendants, where there are more
      than one, at the time of the commencement of the suit,
      actually and voluntarily resides or carries on business, or
      personally works for gain, provided that in such case either
      the leave of the court is given, or the Defendants who do not
      reside, or carry or business, or personally work for gain, as
      aforesaid, acquiesce in such institution; or
</p><p id="p_14">              (c) the cause of action, wholly or in part, arises. -----
              Bare reading of Clause (c) leaves no room for doubt
      that a petition would lie in a court within the local limits of
      whose jurisdiction the cause of action has arisen, wholly or
      partly.
</p>
<p id="p_15">6)    In the instant case the respondent has registered office at New

Delhi. The loan cum hypothecation agreement was executed at New

Delhi. The Defendant failed to pay the instalment of loan at New Delhi.

The cause of action has therefore arisen at New Delhi. Merely because

the clause 24 states that venue of arbitration proceedings shall be at

Mumbai, it does not take away the jurisdiction of courts of Delhi. Infact

this clause does not exclude the jurisdiction of courts at Delhi. The

contention of ld counsel for the respondent, therefore, is devoid of merits,

has no force in the eyes of law and is liable to be rejected outrightly. I

accordingly hold that this court has jurisdiction to entertain the present

petition.
