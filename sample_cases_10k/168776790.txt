 In the High Court of Judicature at Madras

Dated : 11.9.2014

Coram :

The Honourable Mr.Justice V.RAMASUBRAMANIAN

Writ Petition No.24730 of 2014 and MP.No.1 of 2014


Syed Chagan Zuleikha Memorial
Trust									...Petitioner
Vs

1.The Income Tax Officer, Ward 1(2),
   No.121, 60 Ft.Road, Tirupur-641604.

2.The Commissioner of Income Tax-III,
   No.63, Race Course Road, Coimbatore-18.

3.The Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals)
   II, No.63, Race Course Road, Coimbatore-18.		...Respondents

	PETITION under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1">Article 226</a> of The Constitution of India praying for the issuance of a Writ of Certiorarified Mandamus to call for the records on the file of the second respondent in C.No.317(2)/2014-15/CIT-III/CBE dated 1.9.2014, quash the same and direct the first respondent to treat the petitioner as not being in default of payment of income tax of Rs.2,89,04,250/- during the pendency of the appeal before the third respondent.			

	For Petitioner : Mr.B.Sivaraman
	For Respondents : Mr.T.Pramod Kumar Chopda, Standing Counsel

ORDER
</pre><p id="p_1">	The petitioner has come up with the above writ petition challenging a condition imposed by the second respondent for the grant of stay pending disposal of an appeal. 
</p>
<p id="p_2">	2. Heard Mr.B.Sivaraman, learned counsel for the petitioner. Mr.T. Pramod Kumar Chopda, learned Standing Counsel takes notice for the respondents.
</p>
<p id="p_3">	3. The petitioner sold a property, on which, capital gains were assessed. This led to an order of assessment, in which, the Department raised a demand for a sum of Rs.2,89,04,250/-. The petitioner filed a stay petition before the Assessing Officer in the first instance. However, the Assessing Officer rejected the stay petition. The petitioner again filed an application before the Assessing Officer for reconsideration. On the application for reconsideration, the Assessing Officer imposed a condition that the petitioner should pay 50% of the demand. 
</p>
<p id="p_4">	4. Thereafter, the petitioner moved an appeal along with a stay petition, before the second respondent. Upon considering the financial crunch of the petitioner, while granting stay, the second respondent modified the condition imposed by the Assessing Officer, directing the petitioner to pay 25% of the demand. Not satisfied with the deduction made by the second respondent, the petitioner is before this Court.
</p>
<p id="p_5">	5. Citing the decisions of the Delhi High Court in Soul Vs. Deputy CIT [(2010) 323 ITR 305] and the Bombay High Court in Nishith Madanlal Desai Vs. CIT [(2012) 345 ITR 545], the learned counsel for the petitioner contended that once the financial crunch of the petitioner is accepted, there is no justification for imposing a condition. Drawing my attention to the bank statement as on 16.7.2014, the learned counsel for the petitioner contended that the petitioner cannot pay the said sum. 
</p>
<p id="p_6">	6.  I have carefully considered the above submissions. The case cannot come under the category of an unreasonably high pitched assessment. But, the financial hardship of the petitioner has been taken into consideration. Therefore, strictly speaking, the impugned order does not warrant any interference.
</p>
<p id="p_7">	7. However, if we have a look at the fact that the petitioner is a public charitable trust and also if we have a look at the bank statement, I do not think that the petitioner will be able to make payment of 25% of the demand. 
</p>

<p id="p_8">V.RAMASUBRAMANIAN,J

RS
</p><p id="p_9">	8. Therefore, the writ petition is disposed of modifying the impugned order to the following effect :
</p><p id="p_10">	(i) The petitioner shall deposit 10% of the demand on or before 30.9.2014; and
</p><p id="p_11">	(ii) in respect of the balance of 15% of the demand, the petitioner shall furnish bank guarantee. 
</p><p id="p_12">	Upon the petitioner complying with these two conditions, there will be an interim stay pending disposal of the appeal before the second respondent. No costs. Consequently, the above MP is closed.
