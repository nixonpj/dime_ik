     These Appeals coming on for Further Orders this day,
Mohan M.Shantanagoudar J., delivered the following:

                        JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">     The respondents in these appeals purchased certain bits

of properties through a sale deed dated 28.10.2004 from three

persons viz., Rajendra S/o Shankar Rao Hanchate, Shailendra

S/o Shankar Rao Hanchate and Ravindra S/o Gopal Rao

Hanchate.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">     2. The properties purchased are Sy.No.106/2 measuring

3 acres out of 7 acres 2 guntas and Sy.No.107/2/a measuring

2 acres out of 5 acres 9 guntas total measuring 5 acres 20

guntas situated at Peth, Chittapur, Taluk Chittapur, District

Gulbarga. After purchase, the petrol bunk was put up in the

portion of the land, a building is constructed and the said

building is let out to Central Government for locating Moraji

Desai High School. In the remaining portion a building is put

up for running a Daal industry.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                5</span><p id="p_4">




</p><p id="p_5">     3. M/s. Chittapur Cement Works Private Limited was

established on Sy.No.107/3E. The entire premises of the

Cement works included Sy.Nos.106/2 and 107/2/a. The said

Cement Works was due certain sums of money to the

appellants towards electricity charges. Now the said Chittapur

Cement Works is closed.     In order to recover the electricity

bills, the appellants-Electricity Board filed O.S.No.485/2002

in the Court of Civil Judge (Sr.Dn.), Sedam, which came to be

decreed on 21.08.2006. Thus the decree is operating against

Chittapur Cement Works in respect of the electricity bills.


</p><p id="p_6">     4. When things stood thus, the respondents herein

approached the appellants herein seeking electricity power

supply to the building constructed by them. The appellants

demanded a sum of Rs.10,29,283/- the arrears of power

supply due to M/s. Chittapur Cement Works Private Limited

contending that the properties on which the respondents have

constructed the building is the very premises on which

Chittapur Cement Works Private Limited was located, to

which, power supply was provided by the appellants.           It is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                 6</span>




further stated that M/s.Chittapur Cement Works Private

Limited was due the aforementioned sum of money and

consequently, the respondents/subsequent purchasers of the

portions of the properties are liable to pay the said amount as

per Rules.
</p>
<p id="p_7">
</p><p id="p_8">     5.   The   question   as   to   whether   the   respondents

purchased the very property in which the Cement Works was

located is considered by the learned Single Judge in detail.

The learned Single Judge on verifying the averments in the

plaint in O.S.No.485/2002 and the judgment of the Trial

Court in the said suit concluded that, all through it is the case

of the appellants that Chittapur Cement Works is situated in

Sy.No.107/3E. No whisper is made by the appellants in the

suit that the said premises included the property bearing

Sy.Nos.106/2 and 107/2/a. Since the respondents have

purchased the properties which are totally different from the

properties over which the judgment debtor-Cement Works was

located, the learned Single Judge has rightly disallowed the

claim of the appellants made against the respondents. Since
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                               7</span>




the respondents did not purchase the property belonging to

Chittapur Cement Works Private Limited, they are not under

any obligation to pay the electricity charges of Chittapur

Cement Works Private Limited. We find that the order of the

learned Single Judge is just and proper and no interference is

called for.
</p>
<p id="p_9">
</p><p id="p_10">       Accordingly, the appeals fail and the same stands

dismissed.
