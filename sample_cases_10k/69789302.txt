      Let notice be issued to the respondents, returnable on 24th
July 2019. Ms.Mehta, the learned AGP waives service of notice
for and on behalf of the respondents - State.
</p>

<p id="p_2">      Having heard the learned counsel appearing for the parties
and having gone through the materials on record, we propose to
pass an interim order with regard to the release of the goods
seized by the officers of the Goods and Services Tax department.
</p>

<p id="p_3">      It appears from the materials on record that the writ-
applicant herein is engaged in the business of betel nuts. He is a
registered dealer under the Goods and Services Tax Act (for
short, 'the GST Act').
</p>

<p id="p_4">             C/SCA/11009/2019                      ORDER




     The writ-applicant is operating from the State of Tamil
Nadu. It appears that the consignment of betel nuts was being
transported from Vellor, State of Tamil Nadu, to Delhi. While the
goods were in transit and passing through the State of Gujarat,
the vehicle was intercepted by the officers of the GST and the
same came to be detained on the ground that E-Way Bill was not
produced when demanded. In such circumstances, the vehicle
along with the goods came to be seized.
</p>

<p id="p_5">     It appears that immediately the writ-applicant preferred a
representation dated 22nd April 2019 addressed to the State Tax
Officer (2), Mobile Squad, Division-1, Ahmedabad, stating that
the writ-applicant is ready and willing to deposit the requisite
amount without prejudice to his rights and contentions, and on
deposit of such amount, the vehicle along with the goods may be
released.
</p>

<p id="p_6">     It appears that one another representation dated 30th April
2019 addressed to the State Tax Officer (2), Mobile Squad,
Division-1, Ahmedabad, along with the copy of the challan.
</p>

<p id="p_7">     To cut-short the controversy for the time being, the writ-
applicant deposited an amount of Rs.1,85,500=00. However,
according to the authorities, the amount due and payable is
Rs.3,93,750=00.
</p>

<p id="p_8">     There are many larger issues involved in this petition, more
particularly, with regard to the interpretation of Sections 129
and 130 of the GST Act. Many petitions have been admitted and
are pending for consideration in this regard.

     We propose to pass an order directing the respondent
authorities to release the goods on the writ-applicant depositing
the balance amount, i.e. Rs.2,08,250=00.
</p>
<p id="p_10">     In passing the aforesaid order, we take support of one
order passed by a co-ordinate Bench of this Court dated 8th
March 2019 in the Special Civil Application No.4730 of 2019.
The order reads thus:

           provisions of sections 129 and 130 of the Central
           Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017,                 to point out the
           procedure which is required to be followed by the
           respondent authorities in case where any goods are in
           transit in contravention of the provision of the Act or
           the rules made thereunder. It was pointed out that
           firstly, under section 129 of             the Act, the officer is
           required to issue a notice as             contemplated            under

           an      opportunity of hearing to the person concerned,
           pass an order thereunder. It was submitted that it is
           only if there is no         compliance of the order passed
           under section 129 of the Act, that the provisions of
           section 130 of the IGST Act can be resorted to. The

as    "the       CGST        Act")        and         other     relevant statutes. It
was submitted that the goods in question were not
accompanied             by an E-way bill during the course of transit
and    therefore,            the        respondents are fully                justified in
passing        the detention order under section 129(1) of the
CGST Act.

provides        that         the    proper       officer detaining          or     seizing

<p id="p_14">5.    In        the          present       case,       the     show-cause notice
dated        01.03.2019              has       been     issued under               section
130     of      the          CGST      Act       calling upon the petitioner to
show cause as to why the goods in question as well as the
vehicle      should not be confiscated for non-payment of an
amount         of     Rs.60,72,639/-,                as detailed therein. On a
query by the Court, the learned                         Assistant         Government
Pleader       is     not in a position                 to point       out      that      the
procedure, as contemplated under subsections (3) and (4) of
section 129 of the CGST Act, has                        been      followed.          Thus,
prima      facie,         it appears          that     the     show-cause           notice
under section 130 of the CGST Act has been issued without
complying           with the requirements of                   section 129 of the
CGST Act. It is also an admitted position that the goods in
question are perishable in nature.

the petitioner has made out a strong prima facie case for the
grant of interim relief. By way of interim relief, the
