             pro-rata basis and to consider the petitioner's case for promotion to the post of

             A.O. (Scale-I).
</p>
<p id="p_2">                                Facts of the case are that petitioner joined respondent - Company as

             Assistant on 03.02.1987 (Annexure P1). He was promoted to the post of Senior

             Assistant in August 2013 (Annexure P2). Next channel of promotion from the

             post of Senior Assistant is to the cadre of Scale-I officer. It is submitted that the

             petitioner who has spent more than 27 years of service has been put to a

             disadvantageous position because of an arbitrary and illegal criteria adopted by

             the respondents. It is urged that he is appearing in the written examination every

             year from 2011 onwards and despite securing sufficient marks in the written test,

             he was superseded just because of the clause granting 30 marks on the basis of

             service. 30 marks were afforded to all candidates having service of 15 years and

             above thereby, putting the petitioner and similarly situated candidates who have

             put in more than 15 years of service to disadvantage.

</p><p id="p_3">                                Promotional exercise for the year 2014 was set in motion by

             issuance of notice dated 22.08.2014, Annexure P4. Twenty three (23) vacancies

             are reflected under the competitive channel of North Zone, out of which four are

             reserved for Scheduled Caste candidates. Written test was held on 21.09.2014.

             Petitioner's name figured at Serial No.24 in the provisional panel of employees

             declared eligible for interview. His base marks were calculated as 57 (Annexure

             P5). Final panel list (Annexure P6) was prepared and petitioner called for

             interview on 19.11.2014. Petitioner did not figure in the final promotion list

             (Annexure P8) while persons junior to him stood selected. Aggrieved therefrom,

             present writ petition has been filed.

                                Learned counsel for the petitioner vehemently argues that

             proportional marks should be awarded keeping in view the length of service of

             each employee who chooses to seek promotion through the competitive channel.

             It is submitted that a cap of 30 marks on account of service is illegal and

             arbitrary, working a disadvantage to the petitioner. Impugned Policy would lead

             to heart burn as seniors are not promoted and employees who are much juniors

             steal a march over them. Allotment of marks should be on pro-rata basis in

             consonance with length of service.
</p>
<p id="p_5">                                Learned counsel for respondents on the contrary submits that Policy

             in question is valid. It is applicable to employees of four companies/agencies all

             over India and has withstood the test for the past seven years after its

             formulation in the year 2008.
</p>
<p id="p_6">                                Furthermore, selected candidates have not been arrayed as party-

             respondents in this petition and petitioner is estopped from raising challenge to

             the abovesaid criteria after having participated in the process of selection and

             being unsuccessful therein. Learned counsel for respondents relies on judgment

             of Hon'ble Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/1129833/" id="a_1">Om Prakash Shukla v. Akhilesh Kumar Shukla

             and others</a>, 1986 (Sup.) SCC 285 to urge that petitioner having taken a chance

             by taking the competitive exam, is estopped from challenging the process or the

             criteria. It is submitted that even principle of seniority cum-merit is different

             from merit-cum seniority.           In the instant case, it is promotion through a

             competitive channel.
</p>
<p id="p_7">                                No discrimination is worked towards any of the employees by the

             criteria in hand which is fair, just and proper. It is the prerogative of the

                                Policy in question clearly provides for a competitive channel as well

             each completed year of service in the company as on 31st December of the

             preceding year shall be allotted. At the same time, it is a maximum of 30 marks

             made on the basis of seniority, qualification, work record, interview as well as

             marks obtained in the competitive examination. No illegality can be found with

             the Policy wherein maximum marks afforded to an employee for length of

             service have been specified. Perusal of the Policy and the underlining purpose

             clearly reveals that components other than length of service, are to be given

             weightage in the competitive channel.             In respect to length of service, the

             departmental channel takes care of this aspect.            It is a settled position that

             seniority per se cannot be relevant when promotion is by way of a competitive

             examination. There is no merit in the argument raised by the petitioner that

             weightage for length of service should be on a pro-rata basis. If such argument

             is accepted it shall amount to a definite premium on the length of service

             rendered by an employee which is clearly not the intention of Promotional

             Policy.
</p>
<p id="p_27">                                It is to be noted that very concept of affording a competitive channel

             negates reverence to seniority as such. It is not open to the petitioner to say that

             employees junior to him and those who have joined service much later, have

             stolen a march over him due to this criteria.             As stated above, concept of

             competitive channel itself permits said persons to steal a march irrespective of

             the length of service. Any other interpretation would render the provision for

             competitive channel redundant. Learned counsel for the petitioner is unable to

             point out any patent illegality or arbitrariness in the abovesaid provision in the

             Promotional Policy to invite interference by this Court.
