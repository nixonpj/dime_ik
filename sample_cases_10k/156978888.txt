:ORDER  
</pre>
<p id="p_1">[Order of the Court was made by M.SATHYANARAYANAN, J.]      
        
        By consent, the main writ petition itself, is taken up for final
disposal.
</p><p id="p_2">        2. The petitioner claims to be Ex-councilor of 3rd Ward of Thondi.
He came forward to file this Writ Petition styled as 'Public Interest
Litigation'.
</p>
<p id="p_3">        3. It is the case of the petitioner that in order to accommodate the
persons, who affected by natural causes such as cyclone etc., he made
arrangements to build houses under the Government Tsunami Scheme and    
tenements have also been built by spending a sum of                  Rs.3 +
crores  and the said tenements are located at A.Manakudi Village, near
Thondi. The respondents 5 to 23 were identified as beneficiaries and they
were allotted houses and despite that, the respondents 5 to 23 continued to
squat over the land by way of encroachment, without shifting their residence
to the houses built under the Government Tsunami Scheme in Survey Nos.49, 50,  
50/4,51 at Muni Iyaa Kovil Street, Pudukudi, Thondi.
</p>
<p id="p_4">        4. The petitioner would further aver that the private
respondents 5 to 23 without shifting the residence, continued to squat over
the land and also leased out the said tenements in favour of the third
parties and started gaining undue pecuniary advantages.   The petitioner in
this regard, has submitted a representation dated 24.05.2017 and yet another
representation dated 04.12.2017 to the official respondents for removal of
encroachment and despite the receipt and acknowledgment, no steps have been  
taken to do the said lawful exercise and therefore, he is constrained to
approach this Court by filing this Writ Petition.
</p>
<p id="p_5">        5. The  learned counsel appearing for the petitioner would draw the
attention of this Court to the typed set of documents and would submit that
though the private respondents 5 to 23 have been identified as beneficiaries
and they were allotted houses and despite that, they  continued to squat over
the land by way of encroachment without shifting their residence to the
houses built under the Government Tsunami Scheme and despite the   
representations drawing the attention of the official respondents as to the
said illegal act, they failed to invoke any kind of response and therefore,
the petitioner is constrained to file this Writ Petition.
</p>
<p id="p_6">        6. The learned counsel appearing for the fourth respondent/ Executive
Officer, Thondi Panchayat, would submit that the fourth respondent has sent a
communication to the third respondent requiring the assistance to survey and
measure the lands and the said process is yet to be completed and depending 
upon the same, the fourth respondent would take appropriate action for
removal of encroachment. 
</p>
<p id="p_7">        7. The learned counsel appearing for the private respondents would
submit that the petitioner, who is an Ex-councilor with an oblique motive,
targeting the private respondents and therefore, the Writ Petition filed by
him cannot be categorised as 'Public Interest Litigation' and hence, prays
for dismissal of this Writ Petition with exemplary costs.
</p>
<p id="p_8">        8. This Court heard the rival submissions and perused the materials
placed before it.
</p>                
<p id="p_9">        9.Though the petitioner prays for a larger relief, this Court, in the
light of the aforesaid facts and circumstances of the case and without going
into the merits of the claim projected by the petitioner either in this Writ
Petition or in his representations,  directs the third respondent to act on
the communication of the fourth respondent dated 11.12.2017 in
Na.Ka.No.105/2017 and with the help of the jurisdictional Surveyor to cause
inspection of Survey Nos.49, 50, 50/4,51 at Muni Iyaa Kovil Street, Pudukudi,
Thondi, Ramanathapuram District, within a period of eight weeks from the date
of receipt of a copy of this order and communicate the decision taken, to the
fourth respondent and depending upon the result of the said Report, the
fourth respondent after putting the encroachers including the private
respondents 5 to 23 on notice, shall take further action on merits and in
accordance with law, within a further period of twelve weeks thereafter and
communicate the decision taken, to the petitioner, private respondents 5 to
23 as well as other encroachers.
</p>        
<p id="p_10">        10. The Writ Petition stands disposed of accordingly.  No costs.
</p>
<p id="p_11">        11. The Registry is directed to mark a copy of this order to the Taluk
Surveyor, Thiruvadanai Taluk, Ramanathapuram District.
