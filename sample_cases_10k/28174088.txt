                                  Criminal Miscellaneous No.8533 of 2013

                                             ORAL ORDER</pre>

<p id="p_1">3   02-09-2013                Learned counsel for the petitioners and learned APP

                 for the State are present.
</p>
<p id="p_2">                              The application seeks quashing of order taking

                 cognizance dated 09.07.2012 passed by the Chief Judicial

                 Magistrate, Purnia in Sadar P.S. Case No. 205 of 2000 under

                 <a href="/doc/988620/" id="a_1">Sections 406</a>/<a href="/doc/1436241/" id="a_2">420</a>/<a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_3">34</a> of the Indian Penal Code.

</p><p id="p_3">                              The allegation against the petitioners in nut shell is

                 that two trucks were delivered to the informant (complainant) at

                 the behest of the petitioner no. 4 for which payment was also

                 made in the year 1996 and 1998. It is alleged that on 18.07.2000,

                 the trucks were taken away from the informant on the plea that

                 some delivery had to be made but later on neither the trucks nor

                 the money was returned to the complainant. It is further alleged

                 that inspite of taking money and handing over possession of the

                 trucks, the ownership was not transferred on paper in favour of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1"> 2   Patna High Court Cr.Misc. No.8533 of 2013 (3) dt.02-09-2013</span>


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                           2/3</span>




             the informant.
</p>
<p id="p_4">                            Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that the

             story is unbelievable inasmuch as no person would land over his

             commercial vehicle i.e., a truck to somebody else, retaining his

             name so that if there is any violation of any law, the

             responsibility would lie with him and the person to whom the

             vehicle was given can freely carry on all types of illegal

             activities. It is further submitted that it is also not believable that

             a person having made payment and also receiving the vehicles

             would not insist or take steps for transfer of the vehicles in his

             name for almost four and a half years. Learned counsel further

             submits that in any view of the matter, the issue basically

             involves dispute which is civil in nature for which the remedy to

             the informant was either to file suit for recovery of the truck and

             transfer of the ownership or for recovery of money paid for such

             purpose. It is submitted that the criminal prosecution is abuse of

             the process of the Court.
</p>
<p id="p_5">                            Learned APP for the State submits that though there

             may be some allegations having criminal overtones, but basically

             the issue is one of dispute with regard to money/property, i.e.,

             civil in nature.
