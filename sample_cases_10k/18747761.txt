ORAL JUDGMENT : 
</p>
<p id="p_3">
</p><p id="p_4">1.     The petitioner/factory has challenged the order of the Hon'ble 

Minister   Co-operation   dated   19/02/1997   by   which   the   Revision 

Application No.235/1992 filed by the factory, challenging the order of 

the Regional Joint Director, Sugar, Nanded permitting 13 persons to 

be inducted as members, has been rejected. 



</p><p id="p_5">2.     On 07/03/1998, the petitioner and the respondents were heard 

at length. A detailed order has been passed by this Court and interim 

relief is specifically refused by concluding that there is no merit in 

this   petition.     The   relief   granted   earlier   was   continued   only   for   15 

days.   LPA   was   dismissed.     The   petitioner   approached   the   Hon'ble 

Apex Court in an SLP.  By order dated 19/11/1999, the Hon'ble Apex 

Court did not agree with the order of this Court dated 07/03/1998 

and the dismissal of the LPA by the Appeal Bench.  It was observed 

in the order that if the revision filed by the petitioner was disposed of 

without   hearing   the   petitioner,   the   matter   needs   to   be   remanded.

There   is   no   dispute   that   during   the   pendency   of   this   petition,   3 

persons   out   of   the   13   at   issue,   have   been   inducted   as   members. 

None   of   the   learned   Advocates   for   the   respective   sides   are   able   to 

make a statement as to whether any further development has taken 

place in the last 20 years of the pendency of this petition. 



</p><p id="p_6">3.     It   is   apparent   that   this   petitioner   was   not   heard   when   the 

Hon'ble Minister passed an order on 19/02/1997.



</p><p id="p_7">4.     As   such,   this   petition   is   partly   allowed.   The   impugned   order 

dated 19/02/1997 is quashed and set aside and Revision Application 

No.235/1992 is restored to the file of  the Hon'ble State Minister for 

Co-operation.  Needless to state, this order would not create a right in 

the petitioner to remove those 3 persons or any more amongst the 13 

applicants,   who   have   been   inducted   as   members   during   the 

pendency of this petition. 
</p>
<p id="p_8">

</p><p id="p_9">5.     It is expected that respondent No.2 / Hon'ble Minister would 

issue notices to all the litigating sides giving them at least 3 weeks to 

appear before it and then decide the said revision on its own merits 

after hearing all the sides.
