 JUDGMENT:
</pre>

<p id="p_1">   1.         Vide this Judgment, I shall dispose of the present

        appeal     filed     against          impugned             order       dated

        12.11.2018 and 21.01.2019, passed by the Court of

        Ms. Neha, Ld. MM, Mahila Court, Dwarka, New Delhi

        in   CC No. 19795/17 titled as ''Smt Daya Sirohi Vs.

        Vijender Singh Sirohi''.
</p>
<p id="p_2">

</p><p id="p_3">   2.         Briefly stated, respondent filed a complaint

        under <a href="/doc/1373165/" id="a_1">section 12</a> of DV Act wherein vide order dated

        12.11.2018, Ld. Trial Court directed the respondent to

        pay a sum of Rs. 6,000/- towards payment of bills of

        essential amenities of the shared household like

        water bill, electricity bill, gas bill, land line bill etc. It

        was further made clear that the amount of Rs.

        6,000/-shall be in addition to the amount of Rs.

</p><pre id="pre_2">        30,000/-      already             being            paid       by           the

CA 45/19               Vijender Singh Sirohi Vs. Smt Daya Sirohi           Page No. 2/14
</pre><p id="p_4">         respondent(appellant herein) as maintenance to the

        complainant(respondent                herein).           Further,      an

        application was moved by appellant for modification

        of order dated 12.11.2018 but the same was

        dismissed vide order dated 21.01.2019.



</p><p id="p_5">   3.        Feeling aggrieved with the impugned orders

        dated 12.11.2018 and 21.01.2019, the appellant has

        filed the present appeal on the following grounds:-.



</p><p id="p_6">   4.        Ld. Counsel for the appellant has argued that Ld.

</p><p id="p_7">        Trial Court has passed the impugned orders without

        appreciating the complete and true facts of the case.

        It is further argued that respondent has filed the case

        at the instance of their elder son. It is further argued

        that the application under D.V.Act has been filed by

        the respondent without any new cause of action after



CA 45/19             Vijender Singh Sirohi Vs. Smt Daya Sirohi        Page No. 3/14
         the settlement arrived at between the parties before

        the Family Court which fact has not been considered

        by Ld. Trial court.
</p>
<p id="p_8">

</p><p id="p_9">   5.        On the other hand, it is contended by Ld.

</p><p id="p_10">        Counsel for the respondent that both the impugned

        orders dated 12.11.2018 and 21.01.2019 have been

        passed by Ld. Trial court considering all the facts of

        the case as well as income of appellant herein. It is

        further argued that considering the monthly income

        of appellant, there is no scope of any modification in

        the impugned orders. It is further argued that by

        filing this appeal, appellant is back-tracking from his

        legal liability towards her legally wedded wife who is

        a simple house wife and totally dependent on the

        monthly maintenance of appellant.
</p>
<p id="p_11">


CA 45/19              Vijender Singh Sirohi Vs. Smt Daya Sirohi   Page No. 4/14
</p><p id="p_12">         6.   I have heard arguments advanced by Sh.

        Y.P.Sirohi, Ld. Counsel for the appellant and Ms. Manju

        Chaudhary, Ld. Counsel for the respondent and also

        gone through the record and documents available

        before the Court.
</p>
<p id="p_13">

</p><p id="p_14">   7.        Before going into the merits of the case, it is

        worthy to mention here that the marriage between

        appellant and respondent is not disputed. It is also

        not in dispute that out of the said wedlock, two sons

        were borne out. Maintenance of Rs. 30,000/- decided

        before the Family Court, Dwarka towards monthly

        maintenance to the respondent is also admitted by

        both the parties. Further, both the parties have also

        admitted that they are residing together at H. No. A-

        75, Hilansh Apartment, Plot no. 1, Sector-10, Dwarka,

        New Delhi along with their sons.                   Perusal of appeal



CA 45/19             Vijender Singh Sirohi Vs. Smt Daya Sirohi      Page No. 5/14
         filed by appellant, it reveals that the bone of

        contention   is    with      regard        to     the    order    dated

        12.11.2018 whereby appellant was directed to pay

        Rs. 6,000/- to the respondent in addition to                          Rs.

        30,000/-   being     given       by      the      appellant      to   the

        respondent    which       as     per       Ld.     Counsel    for     the

        appellant is not as per law and unjustified.



</p><p id="p_15">   8.        Though, the counsel for the appellant has made

        forceful   submissions          seeking          setting     aside      of

        impugned orders dated 12.11.2018 and 21.01.2019, I

        am not inclined to accept the same.                          A careful

        examination of impugned order dated 12.11.2018

        reveals that Ld. Trial court has very precisely

        considered all the aspects of the case such as

        monthly pension, bank statement and rental income

        of appellant while passing the impugned order dated



CA 45/19             Vijender Singh Sirohi Vs. Smt Daya Sirohi        Page No. 6/14
         12.11.2018 directing appellant to pay Rs. 6,000/- to

        the respondent in addition to                  Rs. 30,000/- already

        being given by the appellant to the respondent in

        view of settlement arrived at in Family Court.

        Further, I also find no ambiguity in the order dated

        21.01.2019 and find merits in the opinion of the Ld.

        Trial Court that no change of circumstances were

        shown since the passing of the interim maintenance

        order and therefore, Ld. Trial Court rightly dismissed

        the application filed for modification of order dated

        12.11.2018.
</p>
<p id="p_16">

</p><p id="p_17">   9.       It is argued by Ld. Counsel for the appellant that

        the earlier two cases filed by the respondent were

        amicably settled vide order dated 26.08.2017 before

        the Family court, Dwarka but respondent again at the

        instance of her elder son has filed the present case



CA 45/19              Vijender Singh Sirohi Vs. Smt Daya Sirohi   Page No. 7/14
        under <a href="/doc/1373165/" id="a_2">section 12</a> of DV Act before Ld. Trial court

       without any new cause of action and just to harass

       the appellant. Having perused the entire material, I

       am not in agreement with this contention of Ld.

       Counsel for the appellant.               Perused the application

       under <a href="/doc/1373165/" id="a_3">section 12</a> DV Act filed by the respondent, it

       finds that respondent has categorically mentioned in

       his   application     before        the      Ld.     Trial   court   that

       respondent(appellant herein) has filed a case

       under the Maintenance and welfare of parents

       and Senior Citizen Act, 2007 against his elder

       son Mr. Kushal Pal Sirohi at Kapeshera for his

       eviction from his residential house.                            She is

       senior citizen and is suffering from old aged

       problems and his elder son is only caretaker of

       her at her residence and respondent(appellant

       herein) is willing to harass her through an act



CA 45/19             Vijender Singh Sirohi Vs. Smt Daya Sirohi        Page No. 8/14
        of expelling her elder son from his house.

       Respondent(appellant herein) had tried to beat

       the complainant with table on 23.09.2017 at

       2.27 pm.     So, in view of above facts, it cannot be

       said that respondent herein has filed the application

       under <a href="/doc/542601/" id="a_4">DV Act</a> before Trial court without any new

       cause of action after the settlement before family

       court and is acting at the instance of their elder son. I

       am also in agreement with the contention raised by

       respondent that her elder son is the only caretaker of

       her at her residence.
</p>
<p id="p_18">

</p><p id="p_19">   10.      It is further argued by Ld. Counsel for the

       appellant   that      electricity          bill     shown   by      the

       respondent were on account of consumption of the

       amenities(A.C) by the elder son at the premises and

       on the basis of aforesaid consumption by the elder



CA 45/19            Vijender Singh Sirohi Vs. Smt Daya Sirohi      Page No. 9/14
        son of the respondent, additional amount of Rs.

       6,000/- per month was granted to the respondent but

       perusal of impugned order dated                           12.11.2018, it

       reveals that the additional amount of Rs. 6,000/-

       awarded by the Ld. Trial Court to the respondent was

       not exclusively for electricity charges but also a joint

       amount for other essential amenities of the shared

       household like water bill, electricity bill, gas bill, land

       line bill etc. Had the awarded amount of Rs. 6,000/-

       been for exclusively for electricity bills, the request of

       Ld. Counsel for the appellant may have been

       considered but it is not the case here.                      Rs. 6,000/-

       was awarded to the               respondent for all essential

       amenities of shared household which as per my

       opinion is not a very big amount to meet the daily

       essential amenities expenditure.                      More so, if the

       appellant is enjoying all the essential amenities of



CA 45/19             Vijender Singh Sirohi Vs. Smt Daya Sirohi        Page No. 10/14
        shared household, it is well settled principal of law

       that respondent is also entitled to enjoy same

       standard of living being legally wedded wife.



</p><p id="p_20">   11.      It is well settled proposition of law that amount

       of maintenance fixed for the wife should be such as

       she can live in reasonable comfort considering her

       status and the mode of life she was used to when she

       lived with her husband and also that she does not

       feel handicapped in the prosecution of her case. At

       the same time, the amount so fixed cannot be

       excessive or extortionate. It is also well settled that

       at the time of deciding the interim maintenance, the

       status and means of the parties should also be taken

       into consideration.
</p>
<p id="p_21">

</p><p id="p_22">   12.      As far as other liabilities as submitted by



CA 45/19            Vijender Singh Sirohi Vs. Smt Daya Sirohi   Page No. 11/14
        appellant are concerned, it is also well settled

       principle   of     law       that      right      of     wife     is   always

       predominant over the right/liabilities. The fact cannot

       be ignored that respondent is not working anywhere

       so any alteration/modification in the impugned order

       will cause grave              prejudice          to    the      interests     of

       respondent who has approached before the court for

       enactment of her legal rights under D.V.Act.



</p><p id="p_23">   13.      It is well settled law of the land that the husband

       cannot take subterfuges to deprive her wife of the

       benefit of living with dignity. Regard being had to the

       solemn pledge at the time of marriage and also in

       consonance with the statutory law that governs the

       field, it is the obligation of the husband to see that

       the wife does not become a destitute, a beggar. A

       situation is not to be malafidely created where under



CA 45/19                Vijender Singh Sirohi Vs. Smt Daya Sirohi         Page No. 12/14
        she is compelled to resign to her fate and think of life

       "dust unto dust". It is totally impermissible. In fact,

       it is the sacrosanct duty to render the financial

       support even if the husband is required to earn

       money with physical labour, if he is able-

       bodied. There is no escape route unless there

       is an order from the court that the wife is not

       entitled to get maintenance from the husband

       on any legally permissible grounds.                           The pleas

       taken by the appellant prima-facie appears a plea

       taken to escape from his legal liabilities.



</p><p id="p_24">   14.      In view of above facts and circumstances, I find

       no infirmity in the impugned orders dated 12.11.2018

       and 21.01.2019 and accordingly, the appeal filed

       by the appellant for setting aside of impugned

       orders    is   hereby           dismissed.                 Copy     of    this
