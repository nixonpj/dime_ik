</pre><p id="p_1">     1. Vide this judgment this court shall decide the present case under <a href="/doc/73862/" id="a_3">Section 25</a>

          Arms Act 1959.
</p>
<p id="p_2">     2. The story of the prosecution is that on 07.10.2005 at about 8.20 am at Outer

          Ring Road, Near CNG Petrol Pump, Paschim Vihar, Delhi within the jurisdiction

          of PS Paschim Vihar, the accused Varun @ Mannu was found in possession of


State v. Varun @ Mannu                 U/s 25/54/59 <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_4">Arms Act</a>                                1/7
FIR No.860/2005 PS Paschim Vihar
           one buttondar knife in contravention of the notification issued by the Delhi

          Administration. Hence, the accused is alleged to have committed an offence

          under <a href="/doc/73862/" id="a_5">Section 25</a> Arms Act. The knife was seized and taken into possession by

          the police. FIR was registered. After completing the formalities, investigation

          was carried out.
</p>
<p id="p_3">     3. Charge sheet was filed against the accused. Copy of chagesheet and other

          scruttable documents were supplied to the accused. Charge under <a href="/doc/73862/" id="a_6">Section 25</a>

          Arms Act was framed against the accused by the Ld. Predecessor vide order

          dated 01.11.2007, to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed trial.

</p><p id="p_4">     4. In order to prove the charge against the accused, the prosecution has

          examined two witnesses namely (1) Ct.Harish and (2) ASI Sukhwinder.

</p><p id="p_5">     5. PW-1 Ct. Harish deposed that on 07.10.2005, he was posted at Anti Snatching

          Cell, Paschim Vihar. On that day HC Sukhvinder received a secret information

          that one person was wandering in the area with a weapon. HC Sukhvinder

          organized a raiding team and went to the spot i.e. CNG Petrol Pump near

          Peera Garhi. At about 08:00 AM, they started vehicle checking. At about 08:20

          a.m, one person came at the spot and on pointing out by secret informer, they

          apprehended the said person. On formal search, one buttondar knife was

          recovered from the back side pocket of his pant. On interrogation, the name of

          the accused was revealed as Manu @ Tarun. IO asked 3/4 public persons to

          join the investigation but they refused to join the same and left the spot. IO

          prepared a rough sketch of knife which is Ex.PW1/A. On measuring, the length



State v. Varun @ Mannu                  U/s 25/54/59 <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_7">Arms Act</a>                          2/7
FIR No.860/2005 PS Paschim Vihar
           of the knife was found to be 24.5 cm, length of blade was 11.3 cm, width of

          blade was 2.4 cm and the length of the handle was 13.3 cm. IO prepared the

          pullanda of the knife and sealed it with the seal of 'SS'. The seal was handed

          over to the witness after use. IO seized the case property vide seizure memo

          Ex.PW1/B. IO prepared tehrir and sent the witness to the PS for registration of

          FIR. After registration of FIR, he came back at the spot and handed over the

          original rukka and carbon copy of FIR to HC Sukhvinder.

</p><p id="p_6">     6. This witness was cross examined by the Ld. APP as he was resiling from his

          previous statement made before the police. During cross examination, he

          admitted that the knife was recovered from the accused. He admitted that IO

          had prepared the site plan in his presence. He admitted that IO had arrested

          the accused and conducted his personal search vide memos Ex.PW1/C and

          PW1/D respectively. Witness also identified the accused and knife in the court.

</p><p id="p_7">     7. During cross examination, PW-1 stated that he did not know whether IO had

          asked any employee of the CNG Pump to join the investigation/proceedings.

          He admitted that they had not offered their personal search before conducting

          the search of the accused. The accused was arrested at about 09:30 AM. The

          seizure memo Ex.PW1/B was prepared at 08:45-09:00 AM. He received the

          rukka at about 09:30 AM. He came back at the spot at about 09:45 AM after

          registration of FIR.
</p>
<p id="p_8">     8. PW-2 ASI Sukhwinder Singh deposed that on 07.10.2005 he was posted at

          anti-snatching cell, West District. He has corroborated the testimony of PW-1.



</p><p id="p_9">State v. Varun @ Mannu                  U/s 25/54/59 <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_8">Arms Act</a>                           3/7
FIR No.860/2005 PS Paschim Vihar
           He has proved the rukka as Ex.PW2/A. He further deposed that after

          registration of FIR, further investigation was marked to HC Murlidhar. He had

          handed over the sketch memo, seizure memo and case property along with the

          accused to HC Murlidhar. He deposed that HC Murlidhar prepared the site plan

          at his instance and recorded his statement. He also identified the accused and

          the knife.
</p>
<p id="p_10">     9. During cross examination, witness admitted that he had not given any written

          notice to the public persons who had refused to join the investigation. He had

          made DD entry regarding departure for patrolling. However, he did not

          remember the number of the same. They all were in civil dress. He denied the

          suggestion that nothing was recovered from the possession of the accused. He

          stated that he had prepared the seizure memo before sending the rukka for

          FIR. He admitted that seizure memo Ex.PW1/B bears the FIR Number and

          other details on the top. He denied the suggestion that the seizure memo was

          prepared later on in the police station that is why it bears the FIR number. He

          stated that he had offered his personal search to the accused before

          conducting his search but he he refused to do so.
</p>
<p id="p_11">     10. By his separate statement, recorded under <a href="/doc/1086076/" id="a_9">Section 294</a> Cr.P.C, the accused

          has admitted the genuineness of the FIR No.860/2005, PS Paschim Vihar and

          DAD notification.
</p>
<p id="p_12">     11. The prosecution evidence was closed and statement of accused was recorded

          under <a href="/doc/224316/" id="a_10">Section 281</a> Cr.P.C. The accused has pleaded innocence and stated that



State v. Varun @ Mannu                 U/s 25/54/59 <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_11">Arms Act</a>                           4/7
FIR No.860/2005 PS Paschim Vihar
           he has been falsely implicated in this case. He did not lead defence evidence

          despite opportunity.
</p>
<p id="p_13">     12. I have heard the arguments addressed by the Learned APP for state and the

          Legal Aid Counsel for accused and carefully perused the record.

</p><p id="p_14">     13. It is a cardinal principle of criminal jurisprudence that prosecution has to prove

          its case beyond reasonable doubts by leading reliable, cogent and convincing

          evidence. Further, it is a settled proposition of criminal law that in order to

          successfully bring home the guilt of the accused, prosecution is supposed to

          stand on its own legs and it cannot derive any benefits whatsoever from the

          weakness, if any, in the defence of the accused. Accused is entitled to the

          benefit of every reasonable doubt in the prosecution story and any such doubt

          in the prosecution case entitles the accused to acquittal.

</p><p id="p_15">     14. In the case at hand, PW-1 and 2 have deposed that they have received secret

          information regarding accused and they reached at the spot and started vehicle

          checking. However, the DD entry vide which they left the police station has not

          been placed on record. This casts a doubt on the very presence of the

          witnesses at the spot.
</p>
<p id="p_16">     15. Further, in "<a href="/doc/136204151/" id="a_12">Roop Chand v. State of Haryana</a>" reported in 1990(1) CLR 69, it

          was observed that such explanations that the public persons refused to join the

          proceedings are unreliable. In case of "<a href="/doc/280656/" id="a_13">Pradeep Narayana V. State of

          Maharashtra</a>" AIR 1995 Supreme Court 1930, it was held that failure of police

          to join witness from locality during search creates doubt about fairness of the



State v. Varun @ Mannu                   U/s 25/54/59 <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_14">Arms Act</a>                           5/7
FIR No.860/2005 PS Paschim Vihar
           investigation, benefit of which has to go to the accused. Similarly it was held in

          the case of "<a href="/doc/176236/" id="a_15">Kuldeep Singh V. State of Haryana</a>" 2004(4) RCR 103 and

          "<a href="/doc/108931933/" id="a_16">Passi @ Prakash V. State of Haryana</a>" 2001(1) RCR 435, that whenever any

          recovery in connection with the place of the commission of offence is made,

          public persons must be made witness.
</p>
<p id="p_17">     16. From the overall testimony of the witnesses, it is clear that the IO has not

          joined any public witness at the time of arrest or while completing the

          formalities. Even though it was late in night and no public persons were present

          at the time and place from where the accused was apprehended. However,

          some vehicles were coming and going from the spot. It is hard to believe that

          no vehicle stopped despite signalled by the IO, who presumably was dressed in

          his uniform. All the witnesses examined are police witnesses. This casts a

          doubt about the sincere efforts made by the IO to join independent witnesses.

</p><p id="p_18">     17. The <a href="/doc/1662226/" id="a_17">Section 100(4)</a> CrPC provides that "Before making a search of the

          officer or other person about to make it shall call upon the two or more

          independent and respectable inhabitants of the locality in which the place

          to be searched is situated or any other locality if no such inhabitant of the

          said locality is available or is willing to be a witness of the search, to

          attend the witness the search and may issued an order in writing to them

          or any of them so to do".
</p>
<p id="p_19">     18. The above said provision has not been complied with in this case.

</p><p id="p_20">     19. It has also been noticed that the recovery memo and other documents were



State v. Varun @ Mannu                  U/s 25/54/59 <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_18">Arms Act</a>                             6/7
FIR No.860/2005 PS Paschim Vihar
           prepared before the registration of FIR. When documents are prepared before

          registration of FIR and it contains the FIR number, an inference has to be drawn

          that either FIR was recorded prior in time or the documents were prepared later

          on and in such cases, benefit of doubt is to be given to the accused.

</p><p id="p_21">     20. Another lacuna in the prosecution case relates to seal. Prosecution case is that

          the knife was sealed by IO with the seal of SS and was handed over to Ct.

          Harish. However, no handing over memo was prepared. Further, the seal was

          neither handed over to an independent witness nor deposited in malkhana. No

          explanation has come on record as to why handing over memo was not made

          or seal was not handed over to an independent witness or deposited in

          malkhana. In these circumstances, the possibility of tampering of case property

          cannot be ruled out.
</p>
<p id="p_22">     21. In the case at hand, all the lapses in investigation casts a doubt on the very

          recovery of the knife from the possession of the accused. The court is of the

          considered view that prosecution has not been able to prove the guilt of the

          accused and has failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt. Accordingly,

          accused Varun @ Mannu s/o Joginder Singh is acquitted under <a href="/doc/73862/" id="a_19">Section 25</a>

          Arms Act.
</p>
