<div class="doc_title">Pragya Mishra vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 6 March, 2012</div><pre id="pre_1">                       W.P.No.11404/2011
06/03/2012
      Shri V.K.Shukla, learned counsel for the petitioner.
      Shri Vivek Sharma, learned PL for the respondents/State.</pre>
<p id="p_1">      Petitioner is the daughter of Late Smt. Savita Mishra,
who was working as a Staff Nurse (Family Health Worker) at
Community     Health    Center   Majhgawan      Block-Majhgawan,
District-Satna. From the records, it is seen that after death of
petitioner's mother, a sum of Rs.25,000/- as Exagratia, a sum of
Rs. One Lac as Group Insurance Scheme and G.P.F amount of
Rs.39,942/- has been paid to the petitioner as on date. However,
as the claim of the petitioner, pertaining to family pension, to
which the petitioner is entitled to, has not been settled,
petitioner has filed this writ petition seeking a direction to the
respondents to pay to her the family pension due in accordance
with rule.
</p><p id="p_2">      On notice being issued, respondents have filed the reply
and the reply filed the respondents is to the effect that as
husband of the petitioner's mother (her father) i.e. Shri Shrikant
Mishra is still alive and as he is entitled to and has a right to
seek family pension, therefore, the same cannot be paid to the
petitioner.
</p><p id="p_3">      Having heard learned counsel for the parties and on a
perusal of the records, it transpires that father of the petitioner,
who is intervener in the present proceedings, Shri Shrikant
Mishra is living separately and even when Smt. Savita Mishra
was alive, he was staying separately, he has filed an affidavit
before this Court indicating that he is living separately and as
the petitioner is the only daughter born out of the wedlock, he
has stated that he has no objection, if the entire family pension
 is paid to the petitioner and he has relinquished all his rights to
receive the family pension. Records further indicate that after
death of the petitioner's mother, when the petitioner was minor,
proceedings were initiated in the Court of First Additional
District Judge, Sidhi under the Guardian and Words Act and in
the said proceedings, the maternal Grand Father of the
petitioner Shri Munendra Prasad Mishra was appointed as
Guardian of the petitioner. Proceedings held before the court
below shows that in those proceedings also, petitioner's father
Shri Shrikant Mishra appeared and testified before the court
that he is living separately and after death of his wife, he has
relinquished all the rights arising after the death of his wife. It
was under such circumstances that the order was passed by the
trial court on 11.10.2004 in Civil Case No.1/2003 granting
custody of the petitioner to her maternal Grand Father Shri
Munendra Prasad Mishra, who was working as teacher.
</p><p id="p_4">        From the facts that have come on record, it is clear that
after death of her mother, the amount of Exagratia, Group
Insurance, G.P.F has been paid to the petitioner. She is the only
surviving legal heir apart from her father, who has relinquished
all his claims to receive the estate of her mother and, there is
no objection in directing for settlement of the claim of the
petitioner with regard to family pension in accordance with
rule.
</p><p id="p_5">        Even though, a reply is filed by the respondents but
except for contending that the petitioner has not produced the
succession certificate, nothing is brought to the notice of this
Court to show that any other person is claiming the benefit.
Records indicate that the amount of Exagratia, G.I.F, G.P.F has
been paid to the petitioner on 11.6.2003, 29.7.2003 and on
 25.3.2008 respectively and even after more than 8 years have
passed, nobody has objected for settlement of these claims.
</p><p id="p_6">      Considering all these factors, this Court is of the
considered view that the claim of the petitioner with regard to
family pension should be settled.
</p><p id="p_7">      In   view   of   the   above,   the   petition   is   allowed.
Respondents are directed to settle the claim of the petitioner
with regard to family pension within 45 days' from the date of
receipt of certified copy of this order. That apart, if any other
dues are to be paid with regard to unpaid salary or any other
monitory benefits, the same shall be settled within the aforesaid
period.
</p><p id="p_8">      With the aforesaid, the petition stands allowed and
disposed of.
</p><p id="p_9">      Certified Copy as per rules.
</p>
