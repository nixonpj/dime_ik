  IN THE HIGH COURT OF KARNATAKA AT BANGALORE

        DATED THIS THE 3RD DAY OF JULY 2014

                       BEFORE

       THE HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE A.S. BOPANNA

         COMPANY APPLICATION NO.862/2014
                      A/W
         COMPANY APPLICATION NO.863/2014
                       IN
          COMPANY PETITION NO.166/2001

BETWEEN:

N.HARIHARAPPA,
S/O.LATE NINGAPPA,
AGED ABOUT 56 YEARS,
EX-EMPLOYEE,
R/O.3RD MAIN, 3RD CROSS,
A.K.COLONY, HARIHAR,
DAVANGERE DISTRICT.                    ... APPLICANT
                                          (COMMON)

(BY SRI MALLIKARJUNA G. CONTRACTOR, ADV.)

AND:

THE OFFICIAL LIQUIDATOR,
THE MYSORE KIRLOSAKAR LTD.,
[IN LIQN.],
12TH FLOOR, RAHEJA TOWERS,
M.G.ROAD,
BENGALURU.                           ... RESPONDENT
                                          (COMMON)
(SRI K.S.MAHADEVAN, ADV. FOR OFFICIAL LIQUIDATOR)

     THESE     COMPANY APPLICATIONS ARE FILED BY
THE APPLICANT UNDER RULE 164 OF THE COMPANIES
[COURT] RULES, 1959 PRAYING TO SET ASIDE FORM NO.69
AND ISSUE DIRECTIONS TO THE OFFICIAL LIQUIDATOR TO
RE-ADJUDICATE THE CLAIMS OF THE APPELLANT BY WAY
                               2



OF ADMITTING CLOSURE COMPENSATION AND GRATUITY
AND UNDER SECTION 5 OF LIMITATION ACT, R/W RULE 164
OF THE COMPANY (COURT) RULES, 1959 PRAYING TO
CONDONE 1222 DAYS DELAY IN FILING THE APPLICATION.

     THESE APPLICATIONS COMING ON FOR ORDERS,
THIS DAY, THE COURT MADE THE FOLLOWING:

                        ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">IN C.A.NO.863/2014

      This application is filed seeking condonation of

delay of 1222 days in filing the Company Application

No.862/2014.
</p>
<p id="p_2">     2.    Though there is inordinate delay, considering

the fact that the applicant is a former employee of the

Company under liquidation and is presently seeking

financial benefits for the period he had rendered services

in the Company in liquidation, the delay is necessarily to

be condoned.         Hence, delay is condoned and CA

No.863/2014 is allowed.
</p>
<p id="p_3">
IN C.A.NO.862/2014

</p><p id="p_4">     3.    CA No.862/2014 is filed by the applicant

claiming to be aggrieved by the rejection of portion of the

amount    claimed.      The       Official   Liquidator   while
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                3</span>



adjudicating the claims had admitted the portion of the

amount and has rejected to the extent as indicated in the

order. The contention in the instant Application is that

the Official Liquidator was not justified in not considering

the closure compensation and the payment of Gratuity.

The said issue has already been considered by this Court

in CA Nos.1382 and 1433 of 2012 disposed of on

21.3.2013.     With regard to the gratuity amount, it has

been held that the claim is to be preferred before the

Gratuity Trust and as such, the reason assigned by the

Official Liquidator is justified.
</p>
<p id="p_5">      4.     The issue is however with regard to closure of

compensation.     Though the Official Liquidator has held

that the applicant would be entitled to the closure

compensation,       there     appears     to    be     certain

mis-conception with regard to the manner of calculation

and the head under which it is to be paid.                  The

observation that it is arrears of wages would not be

appropriate.       The   method     of   calculation   of   the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                 4</span>



compensation has been considered in the above noticed

application which was disposed of by this Court.

</p><p id="p_6">      5.     Hence, on that aspect, the Official Liquidator

would have to take note of the length of service rendered

by   the     applicant   and    based   on    the    same,    the

compensation calculated at 15 days wages for every

completed year of service will have to be reckoned.

Therefore,     the   Official   Liquidator   would     have    to

re-consider that aspect of the matter.              In all other

respects, the order of the Official Liquidator is justified. To

enable re-consideration, the order dated 18.11.2010

impugned herein is set aside to the extent indicated

above. The Official Liquidator shall re-consider the matter

in terms of the above observation.
</p>
<p id="p_7">      Accordingly, the applications are disposed of.
