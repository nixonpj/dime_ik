HIGH COURT OF JUDICATURE AT ALLAHABAD
 
 

?Court No. - 36
 

 
Case :- WRIT - A No. - 28927 of 2015
 

 
Petitioner :- Nar Singh Pandey And 2 Others
 
Respondent :- State Of U.P. And 5 Others
 
Counsel for Petitioner :- Rajkumar Pandey,Shailesh Verma
 
Counsel for Respondent :- C.S.C.
 

 
Hon'ble Mrs. Sunita Agarwal,J.
</pre> 
<p id="p_1">The service report indicates that service of notice on respondent no. 6 is sufficient. No one has put in appearance on behalf of the respondent no. 6. There is no Vakalatnama on record. No counter affidavit has been filed on behalf of the State respondents.
</p> 
<p id="p_2">Heard Sri Shailesh Verma learned Advocate for the petitioners and learned Standing Counsel for the respondent nos. 1 to 5.
</p> 
<p id="p_3">The petitioners herein claim to have been appointed in the institution namely Shri Shiv Japat Singh Inter College, Bhitauli Bazar, Mahrajganj in the year 1989 and having worked uptil their superannuation in 2013-14.
</p> 
<p id="p_4">It is contended that the pension admissible to the petitioner had wrongly been fixed by ignoring the total length of services rendered by the petitioners on the post of Assistant Teacher. The institution-in-question had been brought in grant-in-aid list of the State Government w.e.f. 1.10.1989 and the name of the petitioners, who were working in the attached primary section of the Intermediate College at that point of time were included in grant-in-aid list of the State Government. They were getting salary from the State Exchequer.
</p> 
<p id="p_5">By the Government Order dated 28th January, 2004, by benefit of pension had been accorded to the teachers retired from the attached primary institution to an aided Secondary Education Institution. 
</p> 
<p id="p_6">The submission is that the said Government Order is wrongly being interpreted by the respondents and the denial of full pension is on the premise that the managerial contribution had not been deposited for a period of ten years i.e. from 1989 till the year 1998. 
</p> 
<p id="p_7">The submission is that the issue with regard to the admissibility of the pensionary benefits on the plea of non-deposit of managerial contribution had been settled by this Court in the judgment and order dated 29.1.2015 passed in Writ Petition No. 28679 of 2009 (<a href="/doc/58186198/" id="a_1">Sri Krishna Prasad Yadav &amp; others vs. State of U.P</a>.). 
</p> 
<p id="p_8">This Court has held therein that once the institution has been brought in grant-in-aid list and the primary section of the institution being an integral part of the secondary institution, the teachers working in the attached primary section could not have been discriminated in the matter of payment of pension. It was held therein that under the Uttar Pradesh State Aided Educational Institutions Employees Contributory Provident Fund, Insurance Pension Rules, 1964 (In short "the Rules, 1964"), which came into force on 1.10.1964, there is no provision which curtails the computation of length of qualifying service to the time when the primary section came under grant-in-aid list.
</p> 
<p id="p_9">The petitioners therein have been held entitled to full pension under the provisions of the Rules, 1964 by taking their entire length of service into consideration. A direction has been issued therein that the managerial contribution was required to be deposited by the management and the pension was to be recomputed taking into account of the total length of qualifying service rendered by the petitioners therein.
</p> 
<p id="p_10">The special appeal filed against the said judgment had been dismissed on 24.5.2017.
</p> 
<p id="p_11">Learned counsel for the petitioners vehemently submits that the plea taken by the petitioner in the present writ petition is the same and dispute raised by the petitioners herein is covered by the decision of this Court in the aforesaid judgment.
</p> 
<p id="p_12">It is contended that decision for re-computation/revision of pension by taking into consideration the entire length of service of the petitioners is to be taken at the ends of the Deputy Director of Education (Secondary), Gorakhpur Region, Gorakhpur. 
</p> 
<p id="p_13">Considering the said submissions, noticeable is that the factual controversy cannot be addressed by this Court in absence of the counter affidavits of the respondents. However, in order to bring the dispute to its logical end, the Deputy Director of Education (Secondary), Gorakhpur Region, Gorakhpur is directed to seek comments/report from the Committee of Management of the institution and take a decision by passing a reasoned and speaking order in accordance with law, preferably, within a period of three months from the date of submission of certified copy of this order, on the claim of the petitioner for revision/re-fixation of pension by taking into consideration of the entire length of services rendered by them, in the line of the judgment and order dated 29.1.2015 passed in Writ Petition No. 28679 of 2009.
</p> 
<p id="p_14">Any comment or reply of the petitioners, if needed, shall also be duly taken by the said authority.
</p> 
<p id="p_15">The claim of the petitioners for payment of interest for the delay on account of wrong fixation at the ends of the respondents shall also be duly considered.
</p> 
<p id="p_16">Subject to the above observations and directions, the writ petition is disposed of.
</p> 
<p id="p_17">Order Date :- 19.10.2019
