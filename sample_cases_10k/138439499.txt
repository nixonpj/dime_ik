                           JUDGMENT
</pre>

<p id="p_1">      The petitioner, who is stated to be in ownership of four acres

of land in Survey No.734 of Vagamon Village, on the strength of

Ext.P5 sale deed, has approached this Court, aggrieved by the

steps taken by the respondents to evict him from the said land. The

facts in the writ petition would indicate that the petitioner traces

the title over the four acres of land, that was obtained by him

pursuant to Ext.P5, to four pattas that were granted by Ext.P1

series, to four different persons, by the Government. In Ext. P1

series of pattas, the land assigned is seen as forming part of

Survey No.734 of Vagamon Village. It is stated that in 2002, the

petitioner constructed a residential building in the property that

was purchased by him vide Ext.P5 sale deed, and immediately

thereafter, he was served with a prohibitory order (Ext.P8 order

dated 12.06.2003), alleging that the construction was on

Government land. Thereafter, on the petitioner filing his reply to

the said prohibitory order, the proceedings were not continued

against the petitioner.   Much later, in 2007, by a notice dated

05.10.2007 issued under Rule 9 of the Kerala Land Conservancy

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">W.P.(c).No.7350 of 2015           : 2 :</span>




Rules, the petitioner was asked to show cause as to why action to

resume the land should not be initiated on the allegation that the

petitioner was in occupation of Government land. To the notice so

issued to the petitioner, the petitioner submitted Ext.P9 reply. It is

the case of the petitioner that, thereafter, the matter was not

adjudicated after notice to him, but the respondents proceeded to put

up a board on the property suggesting that the land in question was

Government land. It is under these circumstances that the petitioner

approached this Court through the present writ petition, seeking a

declaration that the property purchased by the petitioner vide Ext.P5

deed cannot be treated as Government land, and for a further

direction to the respondents, not to interfere with the ownership or

possession of the petitioner over the said properties. There is also a

prayer seeking to quash the order, if any passed against the

petitioner, under the Land Conservancy Act and Rules.




</p><p id="p_2">       2. In a counter affidavit filed on behalf of the 2nd respondent,

there is a mention with regard to a notice dated 05.11.2008, having

been served on the petitioner in connection with the allegation that

the petitioner had unauthorisedly occupied Government land.

Thereafter, it is stated that, an order dated 11.07.2011 was served on

the petitioner, through the Village Officer, Vagamon, directing him to

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">W.P.(c).No.7350 of 2015         : 3 :</span>




vacate the unauthorised occupation within 48 hours.       It is further

stated that, the land was already resumed to the Government on

08.11.2013 and that the land, and the partially constructed building,

stand forfeited to the Government for Government purposes. Along

with the counter affidavit, after referring to the notice dated

05.11.2008, supposedly served on the petitioner, what is produced as

Ext.R2(d), is a notice dated 05.10.2007, which appears to be the one

to which the petitioner had replied by Ext.P9 reply, and not the notice

referred to in the counter affidavit of the respondents. The order

dated 11.07.2011, stated to have been passed by the respondents, is

also produced as Ext.R2(e), along with the counter affidavit of the

respondents. A perusal of Ext.R2(e) would indicate that the reference

therein is to the notice dated 05.10.2007 served on the petitioner, to

which the petitioner had preferred Ext.P9 reply.         There is no

reference therein to any notice dated 05.11.2008, which is stated in

the counter affidavit as having been served on the petitioner

subsequently. I also find from a perusal of Ext.R2(e) order that it also

refers to a direction dated 07.07.2011 by the District Collector of

Idukki and further an instruction received from the District Collector

by phone.
</p>
<p id="p_3">


</p><p id="p_4">       3. I have heard Sri.Ramesh Babu, the learned Senior Counsel,

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">W.P.(c).No.7350 of 2015          : 4 :</span>




duly assisted by Sri.Geen T. Mathew, for the petitioner and the

learned Special Government Pleader for the respondents.




</p><p id="p_5">       4. On a consideration of the facts and circumstances of the case

and the submissions made across the bar, I find that, Ext.R2(e) order

dated 11.07.2011 passed by the respondents, cannot be legally

sustained, primarily for the reason that, it was passed without notice

to the petitioner and without hearing him in the matter. I also find

that, Ext.R2(e) refers to an instruction received from the District

Collector, the contents of which were not made available for the

petitioner for his comments.     It is also relevant to note that the

proceedings under the Land Conservancy Act being summary

proceedings, it would be incumbent upon the Government to first

establish that the land in question is 'Puramboke' land, before

proceeding to take steps for the eviction of the petitioner, in terms of

the said Act. Inasmuch as I do not find any of the said aspects having

been noted in Ext.R2(e) order, as already noted above, the said order

cannot be legally sustained. I, therefore, quash Ext.R2(e), for the

purposes of granting the relief sought for by the petitioner in the writ

petition, making it clear that the respondents shall proceed further

with the notice dated 05.10.2007 issued to the petitioner under Rule 9

of the Kerala Land Conservancy Rules, after considering Ext.P9 reply

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">W.P.(c).No.7350 of 2015           : 5 :</span>




preferred by the petitioner to the said notice, as also other documents

to be produced by the petitioner to establish that the land, which is

covered by Ext.P5 sale deed, and on which he has put up the

construction in question, is not Government land for the purposes of

the Kerala Land Conservancy Act and Rules. The respondents shall

pass fresh orders, after considering the objections of the petitioner

and the documents submitted by the petitioner to substantiate his

contentions with regard to the land in question not being Government

land, and after affording the petitioner an opportunity of being heard,

within a period of three months from the date of receipt of a copy of

this judgment.       To enable the respondents to do so, I direct the

petitioner to appear before the 2nd respondent at his office, at 11 a.m.,

on 07.02.2017.
