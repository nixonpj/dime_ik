<p id="p_4">                             This is first application filed under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_1">Section 439</a> of Cr.P.C. for grant of
                    bail to the applicants, as they have been arrested in connection with Crime
                    No.345/2019 registered at Police Station Lordganj, District Jabalpur for the
                    offence punishable under <a href="/doc/1068394/" id="a_2">Sections 393</a> and <a href="/doc/764237/" id="a_3">394</a> of the IPC.
</p><p id="p_5">                             Allegation against the applicants is that on 11.7.2019 near Central Book
                    Depot at Police Station Lordganj, Jabalpur, the complainant, who is a student
                    of MBA along with his elder brother Yashraj Singh was going to his house,
                    then on the way the applicants with other co-accused riding on a motorcycle
                    had tried to snatch his mobile phone. When the accused persons tried to flee

                    away from the spot, then one of the co-accused namely Suleman was caught
                    on the spot. Later on, on interrogation, he has given the information regarding
                    the applicants who were accompanying him at the time occurrence of
                    incident. The applicants have also been arrested. During investigation, the
                    motorcycle which the applicants and the co-accused were riding at the time of
                    commission of said offence was recovered from applicant Ajay Raikwar.
</p><p id="p_6">                             It is submitted by the learned counsel for the applicants that the
                    applicants are innocent. They are young boys aged 20 and 22 years
                    respectively. They have not committed any offence. They have falsely been
                    implicated in the case. They are in judicial custody since 11.7.2019. The trial
                    will take time to conclude. There is no likelihood of their absconding or
                    tampering with the prosecution witnesses. Therefore, it is prayed that the
                    applicants be released on bail.</p><pre id="pre_2">

                    submissions made on behalf of the applicants and prayed for rejection of the
                    bail application.
</p><p id="p_8">                           Keeping in view the facts and circumstances of the case particularly the
                    facts as pointed out by the learned counsel for the applicants, allegation made

                    against the applicants and their period of detention, in my opinion, it is a fit
                    case for grant of bail, hence, without commenting on merits of the case, this
                    application is allowed.
</p><p id="p_9">                           It is directed that the applicants Pale @ Sarbar Ansari and Ajay
                    Raikwar shall be released on bail on furnishing personal bond in the sum of
                    Rs.30,000/- (Rupees Thirty Thousand only) along with one solvent surety
                    each of the like amount to the satisfaction of the trial Court to appear before
                    the Court on the dates given by the concerned Court. It is further directed
                    that applicant shall comply with the provisions of Section 437 (3) of Cr.P.C.
