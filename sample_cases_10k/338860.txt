                  ---------------------------------
             Dated this the 9th day of December, 2008


                            JUDGMENT
</pre>



<p id="p_1">      This appeal is preferred against the order of the Workmen's

Compensation Commissioner, Thiruvananthapuram in W.C.C.No.

60/2001.    The workmen claims to be a worker under the 1st

opposite party before the said court and the Compensation

Commissioner fixed compensation at Rs. 32,734/- and passed an

award. It is against that decision the Insurance Company has come

up in appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_2">      2. The learned counsel for the Insurance Company has made

available before me the relevant records for the determination of

this case.  Heard the learned counsel for all. It has to be borne in

mind that the contention of the 1st respondent as per para 5 of the

written statement is to the effect that "No such person was

employed by the opposite party directly."      In a reply also it is

specifically contended that the claimant was working as an

employee under its Civil contractor Mr. Vijayan. So until and unless

it is proved that Vijayan is an employee under the 1st opposite

party, there cannot be a further employee employer relationship

M.F.A.NO. 18/2007
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                    -2-</span>


between the 1st opposite party and the present claimant. When the

1st opposite party contends that they have entrusted the work

contract to Mr. Vijayan and that Vijayan had employed the present

applicant, we cannot call the present applicant as an employee of

the 1st opposite party. It is very specifically sated in a letter dated

23.9.2000 that "we would like to inform you that Mr. Bhaskaran,

casual labourer working under one Civil Contractor Mr. A. Vijayan

had an accident at Kings Hospital Construction site on 24.8.2000".

So 1st opposite party has got a specific contention that Vijayan was

only a Civil Contractor under the said party and therefore

employment made by Vijayan of the applicant can be only a

employee under the contractor. The Insurance policy specifically

contains the exclusion clause to the effect that the workers of a

contractor are specifically excluded from the purview of the

coverage.    Therefore the Insurance company cannot be saddled

with the liability in the light of the policy conditions. But that does

not mean that the claimant is not entitled to any relief.          The

claimant can proceed against the 1st opposite party for the

realization of the amount.
</p>
<p id="p_3">      Therefore the M.F.A. is allowed and the Insurance company is

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                -3-</span>


exonerated from the liability and the claimant before the

Compensation Commissioner is permitted to realise the amount

awarded from first opposite party by Compensation Commissioner.

The amount deposited by the Insurance Company shall be

reimbursed when a proper application is made. If the first opposite

party has any claim against the immediate employer he may resort

to such proceedings as permitted by law.
