 IN THE HIGH COURT OF JUDICATURE AT MADRAS           

Dated: 23/01/2006 

CORAM   

THE HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE K.MOHAN RAM         

Second Appeal No.946 of 1995  


Manickam                                       .. Appellant

        Appeal against  the  judgment  and  decree  dated  of  the  learned  I
Additional  District  Judge  of Coimbatore dated 08.08.1994 in A.S.No.172 of 1
993 reversing the judgment and Decree of the I Additional District  Munsif  of
Coimbatore dated 21.06.1993 in O.S.No.673 of 1983. 

!For Appellant          :       Mr.  Nicholas.

^For Respondents        :       Mr.  J.Raja Kalifulla

:J U D G M E N T 
</pre>
<p id="p_1">        The  plaintiff  in  O.S.No.673  of  1983  on  the  file  of the Second
Additional District Munsif Court Coimbatore, who succeeded  before  the  Trial
Court,  but  lost before the first Appellate Court, has filed the above second
appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_2">        2.  The suit in O.S.No.673 of 1983 was  filed  by  the  appellant  for
partition  and separate possession of her 1/3rd share in the suit property and
for mense profits at Rs.250/- per month from the date of filing of suit,  till
possession is delivered to her.
</p>
<p id="p_3">        3.   For  the  sake of convenience, the parties are referred to as per
their ranking in the suit.
</p>
<p id="p_4">        4.  The case of the plaintiff before the Trial Court is as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_5">        The suit property is a house property,  bearing  Door  No.12/39  A  in
Arunthathiyar Street,  Coimbatore.  The suit house was originally purchased by
one Savadammal by a Sale Deed Ex.A.5  dated  01.07.1956,  from  one  Marimuthu   
Reddy for  Rs.2,445/-.    The eldest son Ponnuswamy got himself separated from
the family.  1/4th share in the house property was settled in  favour  of  the
eldest  son  Ponnuswamy  by  the deceased Savadammal as per Ex.A.1, Settlement    
Deed dated 27.03.1972.  There is no dispute with regard to the aspects.
</p>
<p id="p_6">        5.  The case of the plaintiff is that the  original  owner  Savadammal
died intestate  on  10.07.1973.    On  the  death  of the said Savadammal, the
plaintiff and the other  son  Ramachandran  and  another  daughter  the  sixth
defendant became  entitled  to 1/3rd share in the suit property.  Defendants 1
to 5 are the legal heirs of the said Ramachandran.  The plaintiff had issued a
notice calling for the division of the suit  property.    On  08.03.1983,  the
first  defendant  issued a false reply stating that Savadammal had left a Will
on 19.05.1973 under which the  suit  property  was  bequeathed  in  favour  of
Ramachandran the husband of the first defendant.  Such a will in favour of the
said  Ramachandran  could  only  be  a  forged Will and not genuine, valid and
binding on the plaintiff and hence the suit is filed claiming partition of the
1/3rd share in the suit property.
</p>

<p id="p_7">        6.  Denying the averments in the plaint, Defendants 1 to 5 have  filed
the written statement contending as follows:  The deceased Savadammal had much  
love  and  affection  for Ramachandran, who was taking care of his mother till
her death.  The plaintiff and the sixth defendant are married and  settled  in
life.  The deceased Savadammal was conscious of the needs and responsibilities
of the said Ramachandran and hence she bequeathed the suit property as per the 
Will  dated  19.05.1973,  by  which  she  cancelled  the  earlier  Will  dated
27.03.1972.  In fact, the husband of the sixth defendant had also attested the
Will in favour of the said Ramachandran and hence the plaintiff and the  sixth
defendant  are  estopped  from  denying  the  genuineness  of  the  Will dated
19.05.1973.   In  pursuance  of  the  Will,  the  first  defendant's   husband
Ramachandran  had  taken  possession of the suit property and is in continuous
possession of the suit property and the property tax is  also  transferred  in
the name  of the said Ramachandran.  After the death of the said Ramachandran,
the plaintiff and the sixth defendant with a view to gain unfair advantage are
trying to cause harassment to the helpless widow, the first defendant  herein.
The plaintiff is not entitled to claim any share in the suit property.
</p>

<p id="p_8">        7.   The  sixth defendant filed a separate written statement interalia
contending that one year after the death of Savadammal, Ramachandran  came  to 
her  house  and obtained her husbands signature in the alleged Will purported
to have been executed by the said Savadammal.  Late Savadammal did not execute   
any such Will, either in favour of Ramachandran or in  favour  of  his  family
members.   On the date when her husband signed in the Will, Savadammal was not  
alive and hence the unregistered Will, said to have been executed by the  said
Savadammal  does  not have any binding force either on the plaintiff or on the
sixth defendant.  But in the Trial, the sixth defendant remained ex-parte.
</p>
<p id="p_9">        8.  On the above said pleadings, the Trial Court framed the  following
issues:
</p>
<p id="p_10">i)Whether the plaintiff is entitled to one-third share in the suit?
</p><p id="p_11">ii)Whether the plaintiff is entitled to mense profits, as claimed?
</p><p id="p_12">iii)Whether the Court Fee paid is correct?
</p><p id="p_13">iv)To what relief the plaintiff is entitled to?
</p>
<p id="p_14">But  unfortunately,  the  Trial  Court  did  not frame any issue regarding the
validity of Ex.B-1, Will.  But, however, the Trial Court elaborately discussed
in its judgment about the various circumstances put forth by both the  parties
regarding the validity of the Will.
</p>
<p id="p_15">        9.   The  Trial Court on a consideration of the oral evidence, came to
the conclusion, that the following are the suspicious circumstances:
</p><p id="p_16">        a) As per Ex.A.1 Settlement Deed the late Savadammal had  settled  1/4
th  share  in  favour  of  her  eldest  son  and  on the same date 27.03.1972,
Savadammal had executed a registered  Will  bequeathing  1/4th  share  in  the
property  to the plaintiff, the sixth defendant and the deceased Ramachandran.
There is a glaring inconsistency in the manifest  intention  of  the  deceased
Savadammal as per the earlier Will and Ex.A.1.
</p><p id="p_17">        b)  Exclusion  of  the two daughters and the preference of the younger
son Ramachandran.  
</p><p id="p_18">        c) In view of the fact that Savadammal was ill towards the end of  her
life,  she  could  not have executed Ex.B.1, unregistered Will, out of her own
volition.
</p><p id="p_19">        d) Late Ramachandran actively participated in the preparation  of  the
Will, Ex.B.1.
</p>



<p id="p_20">The  Trial  Court  pointing  out  certain  contradictions in the deposition of
D.Ws.1 and 2, the attestors of Ex.B.1 Will, did not accept  the  evidence  and
held  that  the Ex.B.1 has not been proved in accordance with law beyond doubt
and accordingly decreed the suit as prayed for by the plaintiff.
</p>
<p id="p_21">        10.  Being aggrieved by the  judgment  and  decree  dated  21.06.1993,
passed  in  O.S.No.673  of  1983,  defendants  1 to 5 filed A.S.No.172 of 1993
before the learned First Additional District Judge, Coimbatore.
</p>
<p id="p_22">        11.  The  lower  Appellate  Court  framed  the  following  points  for
determination in the appeal, namely:
</p><p id="p_23">        i)  Whether  the  contention  of  the plaintiff that Ex.B.1, Will is a
forged one is acceptable?
</p><p id="p_24">        ii) Whether the contention of the plaintiff that Ex.B.1, Will  is  not
executed by the deceased Savadammal out of her own volition is acceptable? 
</p><p id="p_25">        iii)  Whether  the  defendants 1 to 5 have proved due execution of the
Will?
</p><p id="p_26">        iv) Whether the various circumstances  stated  to  be  the  suspicious
circumstances by the Trial Court are sufficient to invalidate the Will?
</p><p id="p_27">        v)  Whether  the  conclusion  of the Trial Court that the plaintiff is
entitled to 1/3rd share in the suit property is acceptable?
</p>
<p id="p_28">The lower Appellate Court on an independent and elaborate consideration of the
oral and  documentary  evidence  adduced  in  the  case,  disagreed  with  the
reasonings  and findings of the Trial Court and held that by examining P.W.s 1
and 2, the attesting witnesses of Ex.B.1 Will, defendants 1 to 5

have proved the due execution  of  the  Will  Ex.B.1  and  further  held  that
defendants  1 to 5 have discharged the initial burden and hence the burden has
shifted to the plaintiff to prove that Ex.B.1 is a forged  will.    The  lower
Appellate Court on a consideration of the evidence on record held that, though
the  consistent  stand  of  the  plaintiff  and  the  sixth defendant in their
pleadings is that the alleged Will in favour of late Ramachandran is a  forged
and  created  one,  during  the course of the Trial and arguments, the plea of
forgery had been given a go-bye.  The lower Appellate Court has  also  pointed
that D.Ws.1 and 2 were also not cross-examined regarding the mental faculty of
late Savadammal.    The  lower  Appellate  Court  considering  the evidence of
D.W.3/first defendant found that Savadammal was admitted in the hospital prior
to her death and she died  in  the  hospital.    Prior  to  her  death,  while
Savadammal  was in the hospital, the pl aintiff took care of her, for about 10
to 15 days and merely Savadammal was in hospital, for a  short  while,  Ex.B.1
Will cannot be alleged to be a forged one.  The lower Appellate Court has also
pointed  out  an  important  aspect  that  the plea that Savadammal was in the
hospital under the care and custody of the plaintiff was  neither  pleaded  in
the  plaint  nor in the written statement of the sixth defendant and therefore
has held that no importance could be attached to the answers elicited  in  the
unguarded moment in cross-examination of D.W.3.  The lower Appellate Court has 
also  pointed  out  that  P.Ws.1  and  2  have  also not deposed that deceased
Savadammal could not execute the Will as she was admitted in the hospital  for
a continuous period of time prior to her death.
</p>
<p id="p_29">        12.   On  the above said reasoning, the lower Appellate Court rejected
the contention of the plaintiff that the Will, Ex.B.1 is a forged one and  the
same could not have been executed by Savadammal.   
</p>
<p id="p_30">        13.   The  Lower Appellate Court independently considered the evidence
in  respect  of  suspicious  circumstances  alleged  by  the   plaintiff   and
disbelieved  the  evidence  and  the lower Appellate Court also considered the
alleged active participation of Ramachandran in the execution of the Will  and
came  to  the  conclusion  that mere participation of said Ramachandran in the
process of execution of  the  Will  does  not  lead  to  the  conclusion  that
Savadammal  was  pressurized and was under stress from Ramachandran to execute    
the Will Ex.B.1.  The lower Appellate Court rightly kept in mind the fact that
the exclusion of the daughters, the plaintiff and the sixth  defendant  throws
considerable  doubt  upon  the  genuineness  of  Ex.B.1  Will and took care to
consider the evidence with extra care and came to the  conclusion  that,  when
due   execution   is  proved,  the  Courts  cannot  sit  over  the  subjective
satisfaction of the testator and for its conclusion, the Lower Appellate Court
relied upon a judgment of the Apex Court reported in (A.I.R.1971 Supreme Court
Page No.2236, Sushila Devi Vs.  Pandit Krishna Kumar Missir and Others).   One 
of the reasons recorded by the Trial Court for rejecting Ex.B.1, Will was that
no reason  is indicated for cancelling the earlier Registered Will.  The Lower
Appellate Court considered that aspect also and held that it is not imperative
for the testator while executing the second Will  to  state  the  reasons  for
canceling the  earlier  Will.  The Lower Appellate Court on a careful analysis
of the entire evidence on record held that  the  due  execution  of  the  Will
Ex.B.1  has  been proved by defendants in the manner known to law and reversed
the judgment and decree of the Trial Court and allowed the appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_31">        14.  Aggrieved by the judgment  of  the  Lower  Appellate  Court,  the
plaintiff has  filed  the  above  second  appeal.   While admitting the second
appeal, the following substantial question of law has been formulated:
</p>
<p id="p_32">        "Whether the judgment of the lower Court is vitiated by its failure to
apply the correct principles of law laid down by the Supreme  Court  of  India
while considering the genuineness of Will?".
</p>
<p id="p_33">        15.  I  heard  Mr.    V.Nicholas,  learned  counsel  appearing for the
appellant and Mr.    J.Raja  Kalifulla,  learned  counsel  appearing  for  the
respondents. 
</p>
<p id="p_34">        16.   Though,  learned  counsel  for the appellant, argued extensively
pointing out the various minor discrepancies in the evidence  adduced  by  the
defendants  he  did  not submit that the lower Appellate Court has not applied
the correct principles of law laid down by the Supreme Court of  India,  while
considering the  genuineness  of  the Will.  But what he submitted is that the
lower Appellate Court has not properly appreciated the evidence on record.
</p>
<p id="p_35">        17.  I am of  the  view  that,  in  view  of  the  limited  scope  for
interference, in a second appeal under Section 100 C.P.C.  as laid down by the
Apex  Court in a catena of decisions, unless the case fell within one of those
categories of cases where the High Court may be justified in  looking  at  the
evidence  afresh,  this Court cannot interfere with findings of facts recorded
by the lower Appellate Court which is the final Court of facts.  The mere fact
that on appreciation of the evidence the Appellate  Court  came  to  record  a
finding  from  which,  it may be possible to differ is not a sufficient ground
for interfering in Second Appeal.  In 2005 (9) SCC  232,  (Commissioner  Hindu
Religious  &amp;  Charitable  Endowments  Vs.,  P.Shanmugama and others), the Apex  
Court has laid down that the High Court has  no  jurisdiction  in  the  second
appeal  to interfere with the finding of facts recorded by the First Appellate
Court after careful consideration of the evidence, oral  and  documentary,  on
record  and  it  was not open to the High Court to reverse the findings of the
facts recorded by the Lower Appellate Court.  In 2 005 (10)  SCC  38  (Manicka
Poosali Vs.    Anjali  Ammal) the Apex Court has laid down that the High Court
while exercising its power under Section 100 of CPC, on re-appreciation of the
evidence cannot set aside the findings of fact recorded by the First Appellate
Court unless the High Court comes to the conclusion that the findings recorded
by the First Appellate Court were  perverse  i.e.    based  on  misreading  of
evidence or  based  on  no  evidence.   In yet another decision of the Supreme
Court reported in 2004 (11) SCC 394, (Basavantaraya Patel Vs.    Laxmibai  and
Others)  the Honourable Supreme Court has laid down that the findings recorded
by the First Appellate Court were based on  appreciation  of  evidence,  which
could not  be  interfered with by the High Court in the Second Appeal.  In the
judgment reported in 2004 (5) SCC 762 ( Thiagarajan Vs.   Sri  Venugopalaswamy 
B.Koil  and  Others)  the  Honourable  Supreme  Court has laid down that where
findings of fact by the Lower Appellate Court are based on evidence, the  High
Court  in  Second Appeal cannot substitute its own findings on re-appreciation
of evidence merely on the ground that another view was possible.
</p>
<p id="p_36">        The  present  case  is to be considered in the light of the above said
principles laid down by the Honourable Supreme Court.
</p>
<p id="p_37">        18.  Though there is no scope for re-appreciation of the evidence, out
of deference for counsel for the appellant, who  wanted  me  to  look  at  the
evidence  adduced  by  the  defendants, I permitted him to place before me the
material on record including evidence, which according to him was  adduced  by
the  defendants and which according to him does not prove the due execution of
the Will Ex.B.1.
</p>
<p id="p_38">        19.  The learned counsel for the appellant drew my  attention  to  the
deposition  of D.W.1 and pointed out the following answers elicited from D.W.1
in his cross-examination.  D.W.1 has stated  in  his  cross  examination  that
because of blood pressure, he could not recollect as to what happened even the
previous  day  and  he  is not capable of remembering as to what happened even
half-an-hour earlier and he does not remember as to where Ex.B.1 was  written,
in which  year  month  and date on which it was written.  He does not remember
whether the Will was written in the morning or in  the  evening.    D.W.1  has
stated  that  Ex.B.1 was written at the house of Ramachandran, but immediately
he changed his version and told that Ex.B.1 was written at the house of scribe
Palaniswamy Chettiyar and Ex.B.1 Will was written as per the  instructions  of
D.W.1.  D.W.1 has stated that in Ex.B.1 Will Savadammal affixed only one thumb 
impression.   D.W.1  has  admitted  that  Ramachandran  took  care  of all the
necessary things for the execution of Ex.B.1.  But immediately he changed  his
version and stated that Ramachandran did not know anything about Ex.B.1 Will.
</p>
<p id="p_39">        20.   The  learned counsel for the appellant also drew my attention to
the evidence of D.W.2 and he points out that D.W.2 has stated  that  the  Will
was  written  as  per  the  directions  of  Savadammal, which according to the
learned counsel is contrary to what D.W.1 has deposed.  Learned  counsel  also
points  out  that D.W.2 has stated that the Will was executed in his house and
he has also stated that Ramachandran was not present  at  the  time  when  the
Ex.B.1, Will was written which according to the learned counsel is contrary to
the deposition  of  D.W.1.    Learned  counsel  also points out that D.W.3 has
admitted that for writing the Ex.B.1 Will, Ramachandran  took  Savadammal  and
the attesters,  D.Ws.1 and 2.  He has also pointed out that D.W.3 had admitted
that her husband  went  to  Saibaba  Colony  and  obtained  the  signature  of
Rangaraj, one  of  the  attesting witnesses.  Learned counsel also has pointed
out that D.W.3 has admitted that Savadammal was in the house of Raju  Chettiar
and  Manickkam  for  two  months  before she was admitted in hospital and even
before that she was not keeping good health and for six months  prior  to  her
death, she was not keeping well.  On the basis of the above evidence of D.Ws.1
to 3, the learned counsel for the appellant submits that their evidence is not
reliable  and  acceptable  and  he  further  submitted  that  prima facie, the
circumstance that no share was made to the plaintiff and the  sixth  defendant
by the testator, will make the Will appear unnatural.
</p>
<p id="p_40">        21.  Per contra, Mr.  Raja Kalifulla learned counsel appearing for the
respondent  strenuously contents that the lower Appellate Court has considered
all the above said portions of the evidence of D.Ws.1 to 3 and has  chosen  to
believe  their  evidence  and  therefore  this Court in a second appeal cannot
re-appreciate the evidence and record a different finding.    Learned  counsel
for  the  respondent  further submitted that it is not a case, where the Lower
Appellate Court has over looked any evidence or misread the evidence and it is
not the submission of the learned counsel for the appellant that  the  finding
of the  lower Appellate Court is perverse.  The learned counsel relying upon a
judgment of the Apex Court  reported  in  A.I.R.1995  SC  2086  (V.S.Mane  Vs.
R.V.Ganeshkar)  submitted  that  a  decision  of facts arrived at by the First
Appellate Court could not be disturbed in Second Appeal.  The lower  Appellate
Court  had  after  recording  cogent reasons accepted the testimony of the two
attesting witnesses and there is no reason to differ with the findings of  the
lower Appellate Court.  Learned counsel for the respondents also relied upon a
judgment  of  the  Apex Court reported in A.I.R.1971 SC 2236 (Sushila Devi Vs.
Krishna Kumar) wherein it is laid down as follows:-
</p>
<p id="p_41">        "If the bequest made in a Will appears to be unnatural then the  Court
has  to scrutinise the evidence in support of the execution of the Will with a
greater degree of care than usual, because every person must  be  presumed  to
act  in  accordance with the normal human behaviour but there is no gainsaying
the fact that some individuals do behave in an abnormal manner.  Judges cannot
impose their own standard of  behaviour  on  those  who  execute  Wills.    As
observed by this  Court  in  H.    Venkatachala  Iyengar Vs.  B.N.Thimmajamma,
(1959) Supp (1) SCR 426 = (A.  I.R.1959 SC 443) that the  mode  of  proving  a
Will does not ordinarily differ from that of proving any other document except
as  to the special requirement of attestation prescribed by S.63 of the Indian
Succession Act.  Proof in either case cannot  be  mathematically  precise  and
certain  and so that test should be one of satisfaction of the prudent mind in
such matters.  The onus must be on the propounder and in absence of suspicious 
circumstances surrounding the execution of the  Will,  proof  of  testamentary
capacity and signature of the testator as required by law may be sufficient to
discharge the  onus.    Where, however, there are suspicious circumstances the
onus would be on the propounder to explain them to  the  satisfaction  of  the
Court before the Will can be accepted as genuine".
</p>
<p id="p_42">        Relying upon this judgment which has also  been  relied  upon  by  the
Lower  Appellate  Court,  the learned counsel for the respondents submits that
the mere circumstance that no share was made to the plaintiff  and  the  sixth
defendant by  the testator will not make the Will appear unnatural.  Since the
execution of the Will is satisfactorily proved the fact that the testator  had
not  bequeathed  any  property to the plaintiff and the sixth defendant cannot
make the Will invalid.  He further submitted that the  Lower  Appellate  Court
has  considered  these  aspects and has rightly held that the exclusion of the
plaintiff and the  sixth  defendant  cannot  make  the  Will  invalid  as  the
defendants  had  proved  the due execution of the Will and have also dispelled
all the alleged suspicious circumstances.  Learned counsel also  submits  that
the  Court  cannot  impose  its  own  standard of behaviour on the person, who
executed the Will.  Learned counsel for the respondents by relying upon  on  a
judgment of the Apex Court reported in (Volume II (2005) S.  L.T.  38, Sridevi
and Others  Vs.  Jayaraja Shetty Others) submits that except the fact that the
testator was old and she died within a short time after the execution  of  the
Will,  nothing  is brought on record to show that the testator was not in good
health and the learned counsel further submits that there is  no  averment  in
the  plaint  that  the  testator  was seriously ill and she was not in a sound
disposing state of mind.  He further submitted that simply because, D.W.3  had
admitted  that  the testator was not ill for over a period of six months prior
to the execution of the Will and she was in the hospital for some  time,  that
does  not  by  itself Will show that the testator was not in a sound disposing
state of mind.
</p>

<p id="p_43">        22.   Countering  the  submission  of  the  learned  counsel  for  the
appellant that the earlier Will executed by the testator was a Registered Will
and equal distribution of property was made to the children and Ex.B.1 Will is
not  registered,  the  learned  counsel  for the respondents by relying upon a
judgment of this Court reported in 1994 (1) MLJ  216  ,  (Rajesh  Vs.    Raja)
submits  that though registration will go a long way to dispel the doubt as to
the genuineness of the Will, when  the  execution  is  proved  by  cogent  and
acceptable  evidence,  the Court should not disbelieve the Will merely because
it is not registered.  He further submits that once a Will  is  proved  to  be
true  and  it  was executed by the testator, it is not for the Court to embark
upon an enquiry, whether the dispositions made therein are fair and just.
</p>
<p id="p_44">        23.  I have gone through the judgment of the Trial Court  as  well  as
the  judgment  of  the  lower Appellate Court and oral evidence adduced in the
case.  As pointed out above,  the  Lower  Appellate  Court  has  independently
considered the  evidence of D.Ws.1 to 3 and the evidence of P.Ws.1 and 2.  The
Lower Appellate Court has rightly pointed out that the burden of  proving  the
due  execution  of the Will, squarely lies upon defendants 1 to 5 and has also
pointed out that the onus of proving the Will is on the propounder and in  the
absence  of  suspicious  circumstances  surrounding the execution of the Will,
proof of testamentary capacity and then signature of the testator as  required
by law  is  sufficient to discharge the onus.  Thus, the Lower Appellate Court
has applied the correct principles of law as laid down by  the  Supreme  Court
while considering the genuineness of Ex.B.1 Will.
</p>

<p id="p_45">        24.   The Lower Appellate Court has pointed out that D.Ws.1 and 2 have
consistently deposed that Ex.B.1, Will was executed  by  late  Savadammal  and
that  Savadammal  signed  in  Ex.B.1, Will, which D.Ws.1 and 2 have witnessed.
Further, it is pointed out that the evidence of D.W.s.1 and 2 is cogent on the
aspect, that Savadammal had seen both D.Ws.1 and 2 signing in the Will.    The
evidence of D.Ws.1 and 2 on the aspect of mental faculty of Savadammal and she 
had executed  the  Will  on  her  own volition is natural and acceptable.  The
Lower  Appellate  Court  has  pointed  out  that  both  D.Ws.1  and   2   have
categorically  asserted  that  Savadammal was not in any manner pressurised to
execute the Will.  It has also pointed out that D.Ws.1 and 2 are  not  in  the
age  group  of the legatee Ramachandran and D.W.2 is an octogenarian and D.W.1  
is in the age of 70 and it is quite natural and probable that  Savadammal  has
chosen her close relatives who are elderly people as eye witness for executing
the Will in favour of her younger son, Ramachandran.  D.Ws.1 and 2 who are the
meternal  uncles  of  Ramachandran  as  well  as  the  plaintiff and the sixth
defendant, have no axe to grind against the plaintiff and the sixth defendant.
As rightly pointed out by the lower Appellate Court this important aspect  has
been omitted  to  be  considered  by  the  Trial Court.  While considering the
evidence of P.W.2, the husband of the sixth  defendant,  who  is  one  of  the
attesting witnesses to Ex.B.1, Will, the Lower Appellate Court has pointed out
that P.W.2  while in the witness box admitted that Mr.  E.A.Sardar khan is the
Advocate for his wife, the  sixth  defendant  and  also  he  is  the  advocate
appearing for  the  plaintiff.   From this, the Lower Appellate Court has held
that the plaintiff and her husband P.W.1  and  P.W.2,  the  sixth  defendants
husband have  joined  together and engineered the suit.  There is no reason to
differ with the above said finding.  It is quite unbelievable that P.W.2 would
have signed in a Will, which according to him did not contain the signature or
thumb impression of Savadammal.  P.W.2 has stated that he had  not  spoken  to 
about the attesting of an unsigned Will to anyone including his wife before he
deposed in   the  Court.    This  version  of  P.W.2  is  quite  unbelievable.
Considering all the above said aspects, only the  Lower  Appellate  Court  has
accepted the evidence of D.Ws.1 and 2, the attestors and rejected the evidence
of P.Ws.1  and  2.    The  Lower  Appellate  Court  has  rightly held that the
execution of Ex.B.1 Will has been duly proved by the  defendants  through  the
attesting  witnesses,  D.Ws.1  and  2  and  the  plaintiff has not proved t he
allegation of forgery.  The Lower Appellate  Court  has  also  considered  the
alleged   suspicious   circumstances  and  has  rightly  held  that  the  mere
participation of the legatee Ramachandran in the execution of the Ex.B.1 Will,
will not in any way affect the genuineness of the Will.  The  Lower  Appellate
Court  has  also  noticed  that the plaintiff and the sixth defendant have not
been examined, whereas P.W.1 the husband  of  the  plaintiff,  and  P.W.2  the
husband  of  the  sixth  defendant,  alone have been examined and P.W.1 is not
assertive in his evidence that no such Will  was  executed  by  Sovdammal  and
P.W.1s  answer  is evasive, that he does not know whether Savadammal had left
any Will.
</p>

<p id="p_46">        25.  The Lower Appellate Court has considered  the  exclusion  of  the
daughters  namely  plaintiff  and  the  sixth  defendant and noticed that the
plaintiff and the sixth defendant are already married and  they  are  in  good
position  in  life  and  that  would  have  weighed with the testator, for not
providing a share in the property to her daughters.  The Lower Appellate Court
has rightly held that the Court cannot sit over the subjective satisfaction of
the testator and for reaching that conclusion the Lower  Appellate  Court  has
rightly  relied  upon  the  ruling of the Apex Court reported in A.I.R.1971 SC
2236.  The Lower Appellate Court has pointed out that it is not imperative for
the testator while  executing  the  second  Will  to  state  the  reasons  for
cancelling the  earlier  Will.    I  agree  with  the  reasoning  of the lower
Appellate Court for interfering with the judgment of the Trial Court.   I  see
no  reason  to differ from the conclusion arrived by the Lower Appellate Court
on the various issues discussed above.  The discrepancies pointed out  by  the
learned  counsel for the appellant in the evidence of D.Ws.1 to 3 are minor in
nature and all those discrepancies have been considered by the lower Appellate
Court.  Sitting in second appeal, this Court cannot re-appreciate the evidence
and come to a different conclusion.  When it is not the case of the  appellant
counsel  that  the  Lower  Appellate  Court's finding is perverse or the Lower
Appellate Court has overlooked the material evidence or misread  any  material
evidence, I do not think it proper to interfere with the findings of the Lower
Appellate Court.   The substantial question of law is answered by holding that
the judgment of the Lower Appellate Court is not vitiated as  it  has  applied
the  correct  principles  of law laid down by the Supreme Court of India while
considering the genuineness of the Will.
