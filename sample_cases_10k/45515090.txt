JUDGMENT: (Per the Hon'ble the Acting Chief Justice) 

        This Writ Appeal by the petitioner is filed against the Order dated
29.12.2012 passed by the Hon'ble Single Judge in W.P.No.17621 of 2011. 
</p><p id="p_5">        The facts of the case briefly stated are as follows:
</p><p id="p_6">        The appellant-writ petitioner is the owner of Ac.20.30 cents of land
comprised in various survey numbers of Menakur Village, Naidupet Mandal, Nellore
District. The State authority issued notice under <a href="/doc/169774/" id="a_1">Section 4(1)</a> of the Land
Acquisition Act, 1894 (hereinafter referred to as 'the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_2">LA Act</a>') on 12.1.2007 and
proposed to acquire the said land under the impugned notification for the
purpose of establishment of an industrial park.   The appellant challenged the
said notification on the ground that the Respondent No.3 being a company, the
procedure envisaged in Part VII of the LA Act has not been followed, therefore,
the whole land acquisition proceedings have been vitiated.   It is further
submitted before the Hon'ble single Judge that no opportunity was given to the
appellant to place the objections.  It is further contended that the 'industrial
purpose' as mentioned in the acquisition proceedings is not really for
'industrial purpose' and as such the acquisition by the State authority under
the impugned notification  is illegal, arbitrary and unreasonable.
</p><p id="p_7">        The Writ Petition was contested by the respondent-authorities by filing a
counter-affidavit.   It has been stated in the counter that the authorities have
duly followed the provisions and issued notifications under <a href="/doc/169774/" id="a_3">Section 4(1)</a> and
<a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_4">Section 5-A</a> of the LA Act and publication under <a href="/doc/466483/" id="a_5">Section 6(1)</a> and thereafter
passed award in the matter on 31.5.2007.   It is pointed out that the
infrastructure development project undertaken by the State  and executed under
the auspices  of Respondent No.3 falls within the meaning of 'public purpose'
and in support of the said contention reliance was placed  on the decision of
the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/1313008/" id="a_6">Sooraram Pratap Reddy v. District Collector, Ranga Reddy 
District1</a>  and submitted that in the said decision Supreme Court held that the
infrastructure development project undertaken by the State Government  and
executed under the auspices of Respondent No.3 falls within the expression of
'public purpose'.
</p><p id="p_8">        The Hon'ble single Judge after hearing the parties came to the conclusion
that the appellant has failed to prove that the acquisition proceedings are
illegal and arbitrary and were issued in colourable exercise of power.  Learned
single Judge held that since no allegation has been made in the writ petition
alleging any procedural irregularity or illegality in the publication of
notification, declaration and holding of enquiries and passing of award, writ
petition cannot be entertained and accordingly dismissed the writ petition.
</p><p id="p_9">        Being aggrieved and dissatisfied with the order of the learned single
Judge, this appeal has been filed before us.
</p><p id="p_10">        Learned counsel appearing for the appellant contended that the learned
single Judge ought to have held that the entire process of land acquisition
proceedings adopted by the State  is a colourable exercise of power depriving
the appellant and others of their land who are agriculturists.     It is further
urged that the petitioner is an agriculturist and the land which is sought to be
acquired by the state authorities is the only source of livelihood of the family
of the appellant. The further point which was stated before us is that the
respondent authorities proposed to acquire about 6,000 acres of land and already
acquired 4,000 acres of land out of which  nearly 800 acres of land was either
sold or allotted to different companies  and recently the 3rd respondent -
Andhra Pradesh Industrial Infrastructure Corporation (APIIC) advertised for sale
of land in newspapers which clearly shows that the entire exercise of
acquisition of land is fraudulent  and in support of the said contention placed
reliance on the decision of the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/1962061/" id="a_7">M/s Royal Orchid Hotel Ltd. And
another vs. Jayaram Reddy</a> and others2 
        It appears to us that the concept of 'public purpose' connotes public
welfare.  With onward march of the concept of socio economic welfare of the
people, notions as to the scope of general interest of the community are fast
changing and expanding.  The emphasis is unmistakably shifted from the
individual to the community.  Therefore, we find that the concept of 'public
interest' and 'public purpose' is not static and varies with time and needs of
the society.  'Public purpose' does not always mean for benefit of the public at
large.   If public derives an advantage out of it, it would be treated as for
public utility.   The development of housing, establishment of industrial
estates comes within the purview of  'public purpose'.   Whether a public
purpose existed or not was a justiciable matter.    Prima facie, it is true that
the Government is the best judge as to whether public purpose is served by
requisitioning the land in question.  But, at the same time, Courts have
expressed that Government is not the sole judge and Courts have jurisdiction and
authority to determine the matter whenever a question is raised whether a
requisition order is for a 'public purpose' or not. The Courts, however, adopted
a very liberal attitude on the question of public purpose and was rare indeed
for a Court to hold that an acquisition of land was not for a public purpose.
<a href="/doc/984542/" id="a_8">Section 6(3)</a> of the LA Act provides that the declaration by the State Government
on the existence of 'public purpose' for land acquisition shall be conclusive
evidence and that land is needed for a 'public purpose'.  This provision
completely barred judicial review of acquisition proceedings where the land is
acquired for a 'public purpose' under the Act, however, excepting where
challenge to the notification was on the ground of colourable exercise of power.
The finding of the Government under <a href="/doc/984542/" id="a_9">Section 6(3)</a> of the Act is conclusive not
only with regard to 'public purpose' but also with regard to its need and
government's satisfaction.
</p><p id="p_11">        We have noticed that where the acquisition would not serve any 'public
purpose' or where it was for a 'private purpose' then it could be challenged
stating that the action is nothing but colourable.
</p><p id="p_12">        After considering the facts of the case and having heard the learned
advocates for the parties, it appears to us that the appellant herein has failed
to make out a case in this matter to show us that the state has acted or
exercised its power colourably.  On the contrary, we find that the provisions of
<a href="/doc/984542/" id="a_10">Section 6(3)</a> of the Act have been duly taken care of in requisitioning the land
in question and ultimately award was passed by the LAO in accordance with law.
We have also noticed that award has already been published in the matter and
property has also been vested in the Government.  In these circumstances, we do
not find that the impugned action of the authorities in acquiring the land can
be said to be either in violation of the principles of natural justice or the
impugned action of the state authority can be termed as a colourable exercise of
power in adopting such acquisition proceedings.   In this view of the matter, we
are of the opinion that the order of the learned single Judge does not suffer
from any illegality or irregularity warranting interference by us. We,
therefore,  find no merit in the appeal and it is accordingly dismissed. No
costs.
