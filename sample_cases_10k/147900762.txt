                                  ORDER
</pre><p id="p_1">P.K.BHASIN, J:
</p>
<p id="p_2">       Defendant no.2, Raj Pal Navrang Yadav, who claims himself to be a
bollywood actor of good repute having acted in good number of Hindi
movies, mostly as a comedian, decided to produce movies himself and with
that desire in view, brought into existence two Companies, defendant no.1
and 4 and made his wife, defendant no. 3, as the managing director of these
Companies. A movie by the name of 'ATTA PATTA LAPATTA' was
produced by defendant no.2 but it proved to be a big flop. Since for the
production of a movie crores of rupees are required and the film to be
produced by defendant no.2 was to cost him about fifteen crores of rupees
which amount defendant no.2 did not have and so he had to seek the
financial assistance from the plaintiff Company whose directors        were

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">CS(OS) 3037/2012                                                  Page 1 of 14</span>
 known to him. He managed to get a loan of five crores of rupees from the
plaintiff sometime in May, 2010 in the name of defendant no.1. The loan
amount with interest was re-payable by 30.06.2011 and defendant nos. 2 and
3 gave their personal guarantees for the re-payment of the said loan amount
and defendant no.4 company also became the guarantor.
</p><p id="p_3">       However, when the time came for re-payment of the money to the
plaintiff, defendant no.2 started playing a sad role before the plaintiff's
directors claiming that his film had flopped and so he was in great financial
crisis. The plaintiff's directors' hearts melted because of the sad acting done
before them by defendant no.2 and so they restructured the payment
schedule and extended the time for the re-payment of the loan amount.
However, defendants did not honour their assurances but still the plaintiff
further extended the re-payment time. Again the plaintiff extended the time
for re-payment of loan amount at the request of the defendants. Every time
the defendant no.2 had given post dated cheques to the plaintiff as security
with the assurance that those cheques shall be duly honoured by his bankers
as and when presented as per the understanding between the parties. Those
post dated cheques, however, were not honoured when presented for
encashment by the plaintiff to the bank of the defendants.
</p><p id="p_4">       Having thus failed to get its money back in normal course, the
plaintiff decided to have recourse to its legal remedy and accordingly filed
the present suit for permanent and mandatory injunctions but when the
suit and ad interim injunction application came up for ex parte consideration
before this Court the relief of recovery of the principal loan amount of five
crores as also interest thereon which amount as per the agreement between
parties had become more than five crores, calculated at the contractual rate
of 30% p.a., was also claimed.
</p><p id="p_5">       On 3rd October, 2012 this court had while ordering issuance of

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">CS(OS) 3037/2012                                                     Page 2 of 14</span>
 summons to the defendants as also the notice on the stay application for 11 th
October,2012 restrained the defendants from from creating any third party
interest in the negative prints of the film 'Atta Patta Lapatta' and assigning
music audio and video rights, satellite rights etc. to anyone without prior
permission of the Court.
</p><p id="p_6">       On 11th October, 2012 the defendants entered appearance in the
matter and it appears now that defendant no.2 had by that time decided to
start acting again, but not in the movies anymore but in this Court, which he
thought could be easily converted into a studio for enacting some drama
and by his sad acting he could succeed in deceiving the Court also. And
that would become more than evident from the facts which are now going to
be narrated hereinafter.
</p><p id="p_7">       On 11th October, 2012 this court passed the following order:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">           "CS(OS) 3037/2012 and IA No.18374/2012 (under Order 39 Rule 1
           and 2 CPC), IA No.18375/2012 (under Order 38 Rule 5 CPC), IA
           No.18376/2012 (under Order 2 Rule 2 CPC), IA No.18377/2012
           (under Section 149 CPC), IA No.18725/2012 (under Order 6 Rule 17
           CPC) and IA No.18726/2012 (under Order 2 Rule 2 CPC)
           The learned counsel for the defendants informs that the defendants
           have already entered into an agreement with PVR Pictures Limited on
           5.9.2012 for exhibiting the film "Ata Pata Laapata". He undertakes
           on instructions that the amount which would payable to the defendants
           in terms of agreement with PVR Pictures Limited would be paid by
           PVR Pictures Limited directly by way of cheque/ pay order in the
           name of Registrar General of this Court and the defendants would
           take a letter to this effect from PVR Pictures Limited and file the same
           in the Court within a week. The remittance to this Court would stop,
           once the remitted amount becomes Rs.11 crores. If the defendants
           enter into an agreement with any distributor/ exhibitor other than PVR
           Pictures Limited for exhibiting the film "Ata Pata Laapata", the
           agreement would contain a stipulation that the entire amount payable
           to the defendants would be remitted to this Court by way of a pay
           order/ cheque in the name of Registrar General of this Court. The
           defendants would be relieved from this obligation the moment the
           amount remitted to this Court either by PVR Pictures Limited or by
           any other distributor/ exhibitor reaches the figure of Rs.11 crore. The
           defendants would file a copy of any such agreement with a distributor/
           exhibitor other than the PVR Pictures Limited in the Court before
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">CS(OS) 3037/2012                                                                Page 3 of 14</span>
            releasing the blue prints of the film "Ata Pata Laapata" to that
           distributor/ exhibitor.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">           Subject to the defendants complying with this order, they would be at
           liberty to release the film "Ata Pata Laapata". It is, however, made
           clear that the film "Ata Pata Laapata" would not be released till
           the letter from PVR Pictures Limited is filed and the copies of the
           agreement, if any, with the distributor/ exhibitor other than the PVR
           Pictures Limited is filed in the Court in terms of this order.
           Written statement be filed within four weeks. Rejoinder thereto can be
           filed four weeks thereafter.

           rights and contentions of the parties in the suit.
           A copy of this order be provided dasti under the signatures of the
           Court Master to both the sides."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_8">       The defendants however did not honour the assurances which they
gave to this Court on 11th October,2012 and so the plaintiff came out with an
application(being IA.No.19802 /2012) under Order XXXIX                       Rule 2-A
C.P.C. That application was taken up by the Court on 1 st November,2012 in
the presence of the counsel for the defendants and the following order came
to be passed with the consent from both the sides:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_6">           "After arguments, it has been agreed between the parties that the
           film ?Ata Pata Laapata? shall be released by the defendants only after
           giving an undertaking that the cheques which they have issued to the
           plaintiff, when presented to the Bank on due date, would be honoured
           to the extent of Rs.7 crores. The agreements which the defendant has
           executed with PVR Cinemas, Yellow and Red Music Movies Mobile
           Distribution and Phantom Films Pvt. Ltd. are taken on record. It has
           been agreed between the parties that if any amount is remitted to this
           Court by any of these three parties with whom the defendant has
           entered into agreements, that would be offset from the abovereferred
           amount of Rs.7 crores and the cheques presented to the Bank would be
           limited only to the balance amount. To illustrate, if an amount of Rs.1
           crore is remitted to this Court by one or more these three parties, the
           defendant would be bound to get cheques only to the extent of Rs.6
           crores honoured on being presented to the Bank. If defendants No.2
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">CS(OS) 3037/2012                                                               Page 4 of 14</span>
            and/or 3 are Directors of defendant No.4, similar undertaking on
           behalf of defendant No.4 shall also be filed. Since the defendants are
           based in Bombay, the undertaking may be scanned and sent through e-
           mail to the counsel who will file the same before the Court at 10.30
           AM tomorrow. The original undertaking would be filed within three
           working days."</blockquote>


<p id="p_9">       The defendants, however, this time also did not honour the
assurances/undertakings given by them to this Court and not only that the
post dated cheques of the total value of seven crores of rupees, which they
had given to the plaintiff, were also got dishonoured. That led to the filing of
fresh application under Order XXXIX Rule 2-A C.P.C.(being I.A.No.5427/
2013, which is now being disposed of by this order). On 5 th April,2013 that
application was taken up by this Court and the following order was passed:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_7">               "This is the second application filed by the plaintiff for punishing
           the defendants for having committed contempt of this Court.
               The present suit for permanent injunction was filed by the plaintiff
           on the allegations that it had advanced loan of crores of rupees to
           defendant no.1 and re-payment thereof was guaranteed by defendant
           nos. 2 to 4. The plaintiff had advanced the loan to the defendant no. 1
           for producing a movie by the name of „Ata Pata Laapata‟, the
           defendant no. 1 had also undertaken to assign its music audio and
           video rights, CD/DVI/internet rights, satellite rights, channel rights,
           export/international rights in favour of the plaintiff as security and
           also not to create any encumbrance, lien, charge etc. on the aforesaid
           securities without the prior consent of the plaintiff.
               Having failed to get back the loan amount as per the loan
           agreement, the plaintiff filed the present suit for injunction in which
           one of the prayers made was for directing the defendants to deliver the
           laboratory letter, conveying the rights on the negative print(s) of the
           above named film in favour of the plaintiff. Along with the suit an
           application under Order 39 Rules 1 &amp; 2 CPC was also filed in which
           injunction was sought against the release of the aforesaid film.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_8">                  The defendants entered appearance and on 11th October, 2012,
           this Court passed the following order:-

                   would payable to the defendants in terms of agreement with PVR

                   defendants would be relieved from this obligation the moment the

                   any other distributor/exhibitor reaches the figure of ` 11 crore. The
                   defendants would file a copy of any such agreement with a
                   distributor/exhibitor other than the PVR Pictures Limited in the
                   Court before releasing the blue prints of the film „Ata Pata

<blockquote id="blockquote_16">                  Since     the      defendants     did  not   honour       the

           moved an application under Order 39 Rule 2A of the CPC, which
           came to be taken up for consideration on 1st November, 2012, when
           this Court passed the following order :-

                   parties that the film „Ata Pata Laapata‟ shall be released by
                   the defendants only after giving an undertaking that the
                   cheques which they have issued to the plaintiff, when
                   presented to the Bank on due date, would be honoured to the
                   extent of Rs. 7 crores. The agreements which the defendant
                   has executed with PVR Cinemas, Yellow and Red Music
                   Movies Mobile Distribution and Phantom Films Pvt. Ltd are
                   taken on record. It has been agreed between the parties that

                   that would be offset from the above referred amount of Rs. 7
                   crores and the cheques presented to the Bank would be limited
                   only to the balance amount. To illustrate, if an amount of Rs.
                   1 crore is remitted to this Court by one or more these three
                   parties, the defendant would be bound to get cheques only to
                   the extent of Rs. 6 crores honoured on being presented to the
                   Bank. If defendants no. 2 and/or 3 are Directors of defendant
                   no.4, similar undertaking on behalf of defendant no.4 shall
                   also be filed. Since the defendants are based in Bombay, the
                   undertaking may be scanned and sent through e-mail to the
                   counsel who will file the same before the Court at 10.30 A.M.
                   tomorrow. The original undertaking would be filed within
                   three working days.

<blockquote id="blockquote_20">               It is now alleged by the plaintiff that the cheques given to the
           plaintiff on being presented have been dis-honoured and that
           necessitated filing of the second contempt application.
               On a prima facie view, it becomes clear that the defendants do not
           have any sanctity for the assurances and undertakings given by them
           to this Court in the present proceedings and that is also more evident
           from the fact that they had succeeded in setting adverse order against
           them when the first application under Order 39 Rule 2-A CPC was
           moved by the plaintiff. Thereafter, they have repeated violation of the
           undertakings given by them to this Court. This conduct of the
           defendants justifies requiring their personal presence in Court this
           time.

           returnable for 10th April, 2013, the date already fixed in the matter.

 defendant no.1 also pleaded for mercy. On that date this court passed the
following order:

                   Defendant No.2, who happens to be the Director of two

            wife, defendant No.3, who happens to be the Managing Director of
            both the two defendant Companies, is however not present today
            though she has been served with the bailable arrest warrants, as
            submitted by her counsel. Mr. Sanjiv Sindhwani, learned senior
            counsel for the defendants has submitted that she could not come
            today as she is in family way. He has shown to me medical papers to
            that effect and, therefore, seeks exemption from her personal
            appearance today. This request is allowed.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_25">                    Learned senior counsel for the defendants has submitted that
            there can be possibly no defence to the show cause notice issued to the
            defendants by this Court for their having violated the undertakings
            given to this Court not once but twice and by getting the cheques given
            to the plaintiff in terms of the undertakings dishonoured and so all the
            defendants are offering their unconditional and unqualified apology to
            this Court and they do not wish to file any reply to this contempt
            application and to contest it. It is also submitted that the dispute
            between the parties was purely of a commercial nature and the
            defendants have already suffered huge losses in their venture for
            producing a movie. The defendant No.2, who is present in person,
            also feels highly apologetic and personally also tenders his
            unconditional and unqualified apology as also on behalf of his wife.
            He makes a prayer that he will do genuine efforts to collect money
            from all possible sources to clear the dues of the plaintiff for which he
            as well as his counsel seek some time. Learned senior counsel has also
            submitted that the defendants have already submitted before this Court
            that they do not have wished to contest the suit also. He requests for
            accepting the apologies of the defendants.

<p id="p_11">       However, before the present application could be disposed of the
plaintiff    moved      an    application      under     section     151     C.P.C.(being
I.A.No.6684/2013) informing the Court that there had been fresh settlement
between the parties terms whereof had been incorporated in the settlement
agreement annexed with the application as Annexure P-1 and so this court
was requested not to pronounce any order on the application orders on
which stood reserved on 5th April,2013. That application was taken up on

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">CS(OS) 3037/2012                                                                  Page 8 of 14</span>
 26th April, 2013 when counsel for both the parties sought time to have some
instructions from their respective clients and accordingly the hearing was
adjourned to 29th April, 2013. On that, however, counsel for the plaintiff
sought permission to withdraw I.A. No.6684/2013 and this Court passed the
following order:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_27">              "Today counsel for plaintiff seeks permission to withdraw this
           application.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_28">               In this matter, earlier also one application was filed by the
           plaintiff for punishing the defendants for violating the undertakings
           given by them to this Court on 1st November, 2012 but on that
           occasion this Court had not taken any action against the defendants in
           view of some fresh assurances/undertakings given by the defendants to
           clear the dues of the plaintiff. In terms of the assurances given by the
           defendants certain cheques were also handed over to the plaintiff with
           the assurance that the same would be honoured as and when
           presented but all the cheques came to be dishonoured when presented
           by the plaintiff to defendants banks. That necessitated filing of second
           contempt application by the plaintiff and this Court after issuing
           notice to the defendants and hearing the parties had reserved the
           contempt application for orders on 10th April, 2013.
               Before the second contempt application could be disposed of the
           present application came to be filed by the plaintiff in which the
           plaintiff alleged that fresh settlement had been arrived at between the
           parties and defendants have once again undertaken to clear the
           plaintiff‟s dues in installments and in terms of the settlement
           defendants have already made a part payment of `40 lakhs to plaintiff
           and the balance amount of `10 crores has been agreed to be cleared
           by 30th September, 2014 and defendants have also handed over to the
           plaintiff some post dated cheques, details whereof are mentioned in
           this application.

           adjourned for today.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_30">               Today, as noticed already, counsel for plaintiff has sought
           permission to withdraw this application in which one of the prayers
           made was to allow the defendants to purge the contempt and also to
           accept the fresh settlement arrived at between the parties. Though not
           specifically prayed in the application but the tenor of the averments
           made in this application shows that actual prayer which was being
           made to the Court on behalf of the plaintiff was not to pass any orders
           on the second contempt petition, orders on which already stand
           reserved and to revive the same to its original status in case
           defendants once again commit breach of the fresh undertakings being

            given in the form of an affidavit of defendant No.2 dated 23rd April,
           2013.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_31">               So far as the permission being sought on behalf of the plaintiff for
           withdrawal of the present application is concerned, this Court is of the
           view that it is the plaintiff‟s right to pursue this application or not but
           considering the fact that after this Court had reserved orders on its
           application for initiating contempt proceedings and for punishing the
           defendants for having committed contempt of Court, filing of the
           present application for not disposing of the contempt application and
           to accept fresh undertakings of the defendants after they had failed to
           honour their earlier undertakings given to the Court on two occasions
           and now plaintiff deciding not to pursue the present application, this
           application is dismissed as withdrawn but plaintiff is burdened with
           cost of `25,000/- for abusing the process of Court. Costs shall be
           deposited in the Lawyers Welfare Account being maintained by Delhi
           High Court Bar Association within two weeks."</blockquote>


<p id="p_12">       Counsel for the defendants, however, maintained that they would still
stick to the fresh payment schedule agreed to between the parties.
</p>
<p id="p_13">       Now is the time to pronounce whether the defendants are guilty of
wilful breach of the assurances and undertakings given by them to this
Court. As noticed already, it has been very fairly admitted on behalf of the
defendants by their learned senior counsel Mr. Sanjiv Sindhwani that there
has been breach of the undertakings and assurances given to this Court by
the defendants but according to Mr. Sindhwani that breach of undertakings
was not wilful and intentional but was due to adverse circumstances in
which the defendants, particularly defendant no.2, got entangled because of
their first venture in the field of production of movies landing in rough
weather. Mr. Sindhwani further submitted that when the going is good
people are with you but when someone is in problems all your near and dear
ones also distance themselves and that is what has happened with the
defendant no.2 also. Since the movie produced by the defendant no.1 and
the production of which he took huge loan from the plaintiff failed to
impress the public at large he has suffered huge losses and for that reason

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">CS(OS) 3037/2012                                                                 Page 10 of 14</span>
 only he could not repay the loan amount to the plaintiff and the undertakings
were given to this Court for the re-payment of money to the plaintiff only
with a hope that defendant no.2 would be able to generate funds from his
friends etc. but that is not happening. As also noticed already, unconditional
apology was also tendered on behalf of all the defendants by Mr. Sindhwani
and defendant no.2 had also tendered apology for himself and his wife who
could not come to Court as she was in the family way and they had all told
the Court on the first date itself that they had decided not to contest the
present contempt application. Mr. Sindhwani simply made a fervent plea on
behalf of the defendants for being merciful to them.
</p>
<p id="p_14">       Now, whether the defendant no.2 suffered losses due to his movie not
doing well commercially or not nobody knows. The defendants have not
even filed any affidavit stating the losses suffered by them were so huge that
they were not in a position to re-pay the loans taken from the market. In any
event, their suffering losses might have been a justification for their delaying
the re-payment of the loan amount to the plaintiff and in that regard they did
get full co-operation from the plaintiff. Thrice, the plaintiff had re-structured
the payment schedule on the request of the defendants. That fact was also
admitted on their behalf during the course of hearing on this application by
their senior counsel who had submitted, to gain sympathy of the Court, that
because of that good and co-operative gesture on the part of the Directors of
the plaintiff Company the defendants had decided not even to contest the
suit claim. However, in my view, their decision not to contest the suit has
nothing to do with their act of committing breach of undertakings given by
them to this Court. The defendants could have very well contested the suit
claim on any number of grounds. Nobody had forced them to give
undertakings and assurances to this Court that they shall clear off their

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">CS(OS) 3037/2012                                                      Page 11 of 14</span>
 liability towards the plaintiff within a time frame and also to give post dated
cheques to the plaintiff with the further assurance that those cheques shall by
duly honoured if the need arose for their presentment to their bank for
encashment upon the failure of the defendants to make the payments
otherwise by the due dates of those cheques. After having given
undertakings to the Court that the dues of the plaintiff shall be cleared
within the agreed period and having assured the encashment of the cheques
the defendants had no business to breach those undertakings and the
assurances/undertakings and to get the cheques dishonoured on the ground
of insufficiency of funds in their bank account. It is not even being put forth
by the defendants that when they gave the post dated cheques to the plaintiff
they were expecting some miracle to happen bringing crores of rupees in
their bank account for the encashment of those cheques. And their cheques,
which they gave to the plaintiff during the pendency of this suit, got
dishonoured not once but twice. In these circumstances, the submission of
the learned senior counsel for the defendants that there was no wilful and
deliberate breach of the undertakings given to the Court cannot be accepted.
</p>
<p id="p_15">       Even during the course of hearing the defendants did not come out
with the money due to the plaintiff which might have indicated that they had
the desire to purge the contempt. Of course, after hearing the counsel for the
parties matter had been reserved for orders, plaintiff had moved an
application, as noticed already, informing the Court that a fresh settlement
had been arrived at between the parties and defendants had made a part
payment for rupees forty lacs and rupees five crores was agreed to be paid
by 31st July, 2013 and balance of five crores, out of total settled amount of
ten crores and forty lacs, was agreed to be paid in some instalments. The
plaintiff had requested the Court not to pass any orders in its contempt

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">CS(OS) 3037/2012                                                     Page 12 of 14</span>
 application and fresh undertaking of the defendants should be recorded and
accepted. However, that application was subsequently not pressed. In any
event, this Court cannot be persuaded again and again to record
undertakings of defendants. That way there would be no end to recording
of undertakings on behalf of defendants since they would get an impression
that violation of undertaking given to Court carries no consequences and
they can keep on giving the undertakings and committing breaches also.
</p>
<p id="p_16">       As far as the apology tendered by the defendants is concerned, that
can, in the facts and circumstances of the case, only be a factor for
consideration by this Court while considering the question of punishment to
be awarded to the defendants but they cannot get exoneration from being
held guilty of committing wilful breach of the undertakings given by them
and total discharge. That may be one of the mitigating circumstances, as
held by a Full Bench of this Court in "<a href="/doc/1326546/" id="a_1">State vs Bhavani Singh</a>". AIR 1968
Delhi 208. If defendants are discharged, then they would succeed in getting
premium for their acts of breach of solemn undertakings and assurances
given to this Court and the plaintiff, in the process, will be left with
unfulfilled promises of the defendants only and the money payable to it shall
remain in the bank accounts of the defendants. That merciful and benevolent
decision, if taken by this Court, would convey to the public at large that the
Courts cannot ensure enforcement of the undertakings given to them by the
litigants.
</p>
<p id="p_17">       In the light of above discussion, I am of the view that the defendants
are guilty of committing breach of the undertakings given to this Court.
However, before awarding punishment to the defendants, I deem it
appropriate to give them an opportunity of hearing and for that purpose list
the matter on 17th May, 2013 when defendant no.2 shall appear in person as

 defendant no. 3 was already given exemption from personal appearance
since she is in the family way.
