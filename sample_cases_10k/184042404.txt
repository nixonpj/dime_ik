DISTRICT JUDGE: WEST DISTRICT: TEES HAZARI COURTS:
                       DELHI.

             Judgment Passed on    :03.02.2015


JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">             The present appeal has been directed against the

judgment and decree of dated 11.10.2013 passed by the court

of Shri Subhash Kumar Mishra, Civil Judge-7 (West), Delhi,

whereby suit of the respondent/plaintiff has been decreed.



2            The facts in brief are that plaintiff/respondent had

filed a suit for recovery of Rs. 2,72,384.57/- against the

appellants/defendants.        It was, inter alia, stated in the plaint

RCA No. 170/2013   Ranjit Singh &amp; Sompal Vs. SBI    Page 1/6
 that    defendant      No.1/appellant        No.1   approached       the

respondent/plaintiff bank for personal loan facility for the

marriage of his daughter. The respondent/plaintiff considered the

loan application of defendant No.1 and sanctioned a loan of

Rs. 2 lacs which was released to him on 18.8.2004.             Defendant

No.1 was to repay the said loan in 30 EMIs of Rs. 7,820/- each

alongwith interest @ 12.75 per annum. Defendant No.2/appellant

No.2 stood guarantor for the said loan and executed loan

agreement in favour of the respondent/plaintiff bank.             It was

alleged that defendant No.1 defaulted in making payment of

EMIs.   The respondent/plaintiff bank had to recall the loan by

legal notice dated 30.6.2010. However, defendants did not repay

the outstanding amount. Hence, the suit.
</p>
<p id="p_2">

3            In the written statement, defendant No.1 raised the

preliminary objection that the suit was barred by limitation; the

revival letter was forged and fabricated as it did not bear his

signature and some blank papers were got signed by the plaintiff

bank/respondent.
</p>
<p id="p_3">

4          In the written statement filed on behalf of         defendant

No.2, he also took the preliminary objection of limitation and the

revival letter was forged and fabricated as it did not bear his



RCA No. 170/2013   Ranjit Singh &amp; Sompal Vs. SBI    Page 2/6
 signature. Other pleas were also denied parawise.

5         No replication was filed by the respondent/plaintiff bank.



6     On the pleadings of the parties, the trial court framed the

following issues:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">      i) Whether        the    plaintiff    is      entitled   to    recover

          Rs.2,72,384.57alongwith                interest      from     the

          defendant ? OPP

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">      ii) Whether the suit of the plaintiff is barred by

          limitation? OPD

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">      iii)Relief.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">

</blockquote><p id="p_4">7            I have heard Ld. Counsels for the parties and have

perused the material placed on record.
</p>
<p id="p_5">      It has been argued on behalf of the appellants that the trial

court has wrongly concluded that suit of the respondent/plaintiff

was within the period of limitation.        It has been argued that the

suit was time barred and the revival letters were not signed by

the appellants/defendants. This is the only short argument which

has been advanced on behalf of the appellants/defendants.

</p><p id="p_6">      On the other hand, Ld. Counsel for the respondent/plaintiff

has argued that the trial court has wrongly concluded that the

suit was within the limitation.        He has further argued that no



RCA No. 170/2013    Ranjit Singh &amp; Sompal Vs. SBI         Page 3/6
 evidence was brought on record to show that the revival letters

were not signed by the appellants/defendants.



8             To appreciate the arguments of Ld. Counsels for the

parties, a look has to be made to the judgment of the trial court

and the evidence on record.
</p>
<p id="p_7">      Firstly, the judgment of the trial court is taken up.      If the

judgment of the trial court is perused, it is noticed that the trial

court after making reference to Ex.PW.1/6 which was the revival

letter denied by defendant No.1 having executed, have concluded

that Ex.PW.1/6 was placed on record by the plaintiff/respondent

on the basis of which limitation period was got extended.        Since

this revival letter Ex.PW.1/6 was brought on record on behalf of

plaintiff/respondent, the burden of proof which           was on the

plaintiff/respondent was discharged and the onus shifted on the

defendants to disprove the same.         It has taken the view that the

defendants did not bring any expert witness to prove the said

fact. That being so, the defendants failed to discharge the proof

which was on them.         Thus, the trial court has relied upon the

revival letter Ex.PW.1/6 which was executed on 7.7.2007 and the

suit was instituted on 6.7.2010 which was within the period of

limitation.
</p>
<p id="p_8">


RCA No. 170/2013   Ranjit Singh &amp; Sompal Vs. SBI     Page 4/6
 9            Coming to the evidence on record, if the testimony of

Smt. Sunita Dhingra, DW.1 is perused, it is noticed that          with

regard to Ex.PW.1/6 only suggestion has been given to this

witness. Further, to the testimony of Shri Ranjit Singh, DW.1, he

has admitted in his cross-examination that at the time of taking

loan, he had signed many documents including loan agreement.

He has voluntarily stated that documents were blank. However,

he has stated that he did not make any complaint before any

authority regarding signing blank papers.          To quote from his

testimony, "It is right to suggest that I never made any complaint

before any authority regarding signing of blank papers by me."

He has further denied of having signed any revival letter         The

fact that he has not made any complaint with regard to having

signed on blank papers, his plea that the bank officials have got

his signatures on blank papers cannot be accepted.

</p><p id="p_9">      With regard to his plea that he never signed the revival

letter, the fact that he has not brought any witness to show that

Ex.PW.1/6 was forged and fabricated and he never signed the

same, his this plea also goes.        Further, he has admitted in his

cross-examination that he had taken the loan of Rs. 2 lacs from

the plaintiff bank in the year 2004.          With regard to the court

question about his liability to pay the loan, it has come on record

that he remained silent for a while and then said the plaintiff



RCA No. 170/2013   Ranjit Singh &amp; Sompal Vs. SBI     Page 5/6
 bank did a wrong with him.              The fact that the defendant

admitted    of having taken loan of Rs.2 lacs, certainly he was

liable for the same.      When the defendant has not made any

complaint of having signed blank papers and has not examined

any witness to show that the revival letter Ex.PW.1/6 was forged

and fabricated, document Ex.PW.1/6 has to be taken as signed

by the defendant.
</p>
<p id="p_10">      Since the revival letter Ex.PW.1/6 was of dated 7.7.2007

and the suit has been instituted on 6.7.2010, certainly the suit

was within the period of limitation.          Therefore, the argument

advanced on behalf of Ld. Counsel for the appellants/defendants

that the suit was not within the period of limitation is of no avail

and the same stands rejected.
</p>
<p id="p_11">

11           In view of the above, I am of the opinion that there is

no error or illegality in the judgment passed by the trial court.

Therefore, the appeal is devoid of any merits and the same

deserves dismissal. Hence, the appeal is dismissed. TCR be sent

back with a copy of the order. Appeal file be consigned to Record

Room.
