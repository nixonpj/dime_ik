</pre>

<p id="p_1">     This is an appeal filed by the State under <a href="/doc/1280620/" id="a_2">Section

378</a> (1) &amp; (3) of <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_3">Cr.P.C</a> challenging the judgment dated

24.03.2009 made in S.C.No.10/2007 on the file of

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                               3</span><p id="p_2">


</p><p id="p_3">     2. For the purpose of convenience, and better

understanding, 'the respondents 1 to 4' are hereinafter

referred to as 'the accused Nos.1 to 4' respectively.


</p><p id="p_4">     3. Brief facts of the case leading to the filing of the

appeal may be stated as under:
</p>
<p id="p_5">
</p><p id="p_6">     PW1-Amita is the wife of deceased Jaiprakash

Shetty. On 15.10.2006, she lodged a missing complaint

stating that her husband was missing after he left the

house at 10.30 p.m. on 13.10.2006. Her complaint at

Ex.P1    was     registered   in    Crime     No.88/06    of

Shankaranarayana Police Station, Udupi. After the dead

body of Jaiprakash Shetty was traced, PW4-Seetarama

Shetty, brother of the deceased lodged a complaint and

the same was registered in Crime No.91/2006 against the

accused Nos.1 to 4 for the offences punishable under

<a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_9">Sections 302</a>, <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_10">201</a> &amp; <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_11">109</a> r/w <a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_12">Section 34</a> of IPC and under

<a href="/doc/1092263/" id="a_13">Sections 3</a> and <a href="/doc/73862/" id="a_14">25</a> of the Indian Arms Act, 1959. The case

of the prosecution is that the accused Nos.1 and 2 are

cousin brothers and they are close associates of accused
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                              4</span>

No.3-Subramanya Udupa. It is stated that a lady by name

Shubbavathi agitated against accused No.3 when he

refused to pay her coolie amount.       At that time, the

deceased Jaiprakash Shetty of Kodaledi Village supported

her and as a result of which accused No.3 had ill-will

against him and therefore, the accused No.3 along with

accused Nos.1 and 2 got Jaiprakash Shetty killed for a

sum of Rs.1 Lakh.       It is stated that on 13.10.2006,

accused Nos.1 to 3 after hatching a plan of killing

Jaiprakash Shetty, acused Nos.1 and 2 secured a gun

from PW-5-Krishna Poojary (owner of gun with licence) on

the pretext of going to forest area for hunting and on the

same evening, they called Jaiprakash Shetty and asked

him to accompany them for the purpose of cutting and

removing    sandalwood     trees   in   the   forest   area.

Accordingly, Jaiprakash Shetty took his motor cycle

bearing registration No.KA20/S 2421 along with accused

Nos.1 and 2 as a pillion rider and on that night at about

11.45 p.m., accused No.1 who was sitting as a pillion rider

fired at the back of chest of Jaiprakash Shetty, as a result
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                5</span>

of which, he sustained gun shot injury and fell down along

with the motor cycle and breathed his last and accused

Nos.1 and 2, the pillion riders also fell down and

sustained injuries.
</p>
<p id="p_7">
</p><p id="p_8">      4. During the course of investigation, accused Nos.1

and   2     were   arrested   on   17.10.2006.         After   the

investigation was over, charge sheet came to be laid

against the accused for the above said offences.               The

accused faced trial for the above said offences.


</p><p id="p_9">      5. In support of the case of the prosecution, it has

got examined as many as 18 witnesses, got marked 32

documents and got exhibited 15 Material Objects. During

the course of cross-examination of PWs1 to 9, the defence

has got a portion of their statement marked as Exs.D1

and   D2.      Further,   copy     of   the   charge   sheet    in

C.C.No.443/01 on the file of JMFC, Kundapura has been

marked as Ex.D3.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                             6</span><p id="p_10">

</p><p id="p_11">     6. After the evidence of the side of the prosecution

was closed, the trial Court recorded the statement of the

accused under <a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_15">Section 313</a> of Cr.P.C. The accused have

denied all the incriminating circumstances appearing in

the evidence of prosecution witnesses.      They have not

adduced any defence evidence.
</p>
<p id="p_12">
</p><p id="p_13">     7. The Trial Court after hearing arguments and

perusing the oral and documentary evidence on record,

came to a conclusion that the accused are innocent of the

offences alleged against them and therefore, recorded an

order of acquittal in their favour, which is impugned in

this appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_14">
</p><p id="p_15">     8.   Learned   Additional   State   Public   Prosecutor

submits that though there is no eye-witness to the alleged

incident, the circumstantial evidence adduced is sufficient

to base conviction, but the trial Court erred in rejecting

the same. He further submits that the prosecution proved

that accused Nos.1 and 2 have sustained injuries in the

incident and that PW5-Krishna Poojary has deposed that
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                7</span>

he has given his gun to accused No.1 for the purpose of

hunting. He also submits that the shirt of accused Nos.1

and 2 worn at the time of the incident were seized under a

panchanama and they were subjected to FSL report and

according to the report, the shirts of accused Nos.1 and 2

were stained with blood. Therefore, he submits that the

impugned judgment may be set aside and the accused

may be convicted for the offences alleged against them.


</p><p id="p_16">      9. There is no representation for the respondents-

accused.
</p>
<p id="p_17">
</p><p id="p_18">      10. We have perused the LCR.
</p>
<p id="p_19">
</p><p id="p_20">      11.   In   view   of    the     grounds   urged   in    the

memorandum of appeal and the arguments addressed by

the   learned    Additional   State    Public   Prosecutor,   we

formulate the following point for our consideration:


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">            Whether the impugned judgment calls
      for our interference?</blockquote><p id="p_21">
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                               8</span>

</p><p id="p_22">        Our answer to the above point is in the negative for

the following reasons:
</p>
<p id="p_23">
</p><p id="p_24">        At the very outset, it must be mentioned that the

very motive for the accused to commit murder of

Jaiprakash Shetty on account of his supporting a lady-

Shubbavathi who made dharna in front of accused No.3 is

not proved by examining the said lady.       The allegation

made against the accused No.4 is that after accused Nos.1

and 2 killed Jaiprakash Shetty with the assistance of

accused No.4, and caused disappearance of the dead

body.     There is no cogent and satisfactory evidence on

record to show that the accused No.4 has committed the

offence punishable under <a href="/doc/386021/" id="a_16">Section 201</a> of IPC.


</p><p id="p_25">        12. Now we come to accused No.3.     At the cost of

repetition, it must be mentioned that the whole case of the

prosecution hinges upon the circumstantial evidence. The

case of the prosecution is that after the accused Nos.1 and

2 killed Jaiprakash Shetty, accused No.1 came and

handed over the gun to PW5 and also reported to accused
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                 9</span>

No.3 that they killed Jaiprakash Shetty, but the same is

not proved in evidence.             There is no cogent and

satisfactory evidence to connect the accused No.3 with the

alleged offences.
</p>
<p id="p_26">
</p><p id="p_27">     13. Now we come to the case of accused Nos.1 and

</p><p id="p_28">2. No doubt, accused Nos.1 and 2 have sustained injuries

as per wound certificates at Exs.P14 &amp; P15, issued by -

PW11-Dr.Rupa,       she   has   certified   stating   that   they

(Accused Nos.1 &amp; 2) had sustained injuries and the age of

the injury was 3 to 4 days.          Merely, because accused

Nos.1 and 2 have sustained injuries cannot be a sufficient

ground to convict them as there is no evidence on record

to show that accused Nos.1 and 2 were pillion riders on

the motor cycle driven by the deceased Jaiprakash Shetty.


</p><p id="p_29">     14. PW5 who is the owner of the gun, has not lodged

a complaint with the police. As per the conditions of the

licence, PW5-Krishna Poojary who is a licenced gun holder

is not supposed to give the same to any other person, but,

the police have not initiated any action against PW5. The
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                             10</span>

case of the prosecution is that accused No.1-pillion rider

fired at the back of the deceased while the deceased was

driving the motor cycle.   The post mortem report of the

deceased at Ex.P22, discloses that the cause of death was

due to short gun injury to the chest and the time of death

was between 3 to 4 days prior to conducting post mortem

examination.   But the Ballistic report of the gun (which

was alleged to be seized from accused No.3) does not

support the case of the prosecution to that effect. In other

words, the Ballistic Expert report at Ex.P11 reveals that

the approximate range of firing with respect to wound of

entry mentioned in the PM report is beyond nine feet from

the mazzle end of the gun.       Thus, the Ballistic report

falsifies the case of the prosecution that accused No.1 as a

pillion rider fired at the back of Jaiprakash Shetty who

was driving the motor cycle.     The prosecution has not

established the chain of circumstances.      Therefore, we

hold that the trial Court is justified in acquitting the

accused for the charges levelled against the accused and

the impugned judgment does not call for our interference.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                             11</span>

</p><p id="p_30">      15. In the result, we pass the following order:

Appeal fails and the same is hereby rejected.
