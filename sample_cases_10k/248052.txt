<p id="p_1">JUDGMENT
 

A.R. Dave, J.
</p> 

<p id="p_2"> 1. Rule.  Learned advocate Mr.Jadeja  appearing  for  the respondent waives service of rule.  At the request of  the learned advocates, the matter is heard finally today. 
</p>  

<p id="p_3"> 2. The  facts giving rise to the present petition in  a nutshell are as under:- 
</p><p id="p_4">  The respondent was working as a  Conductor  under  the petitioner-corporation.  By an order dated 28/7/1993,  the respondent  was  dismissed  from  the  service.    On  1/5/1992, a bus in which the  respondent  was  performing  his  duty  as  a Conductor was checked and at the time of  checking, it was found that the respondent had not issued  tickets to 36 passengers belonging to  different  groups.  In  the circumstances, departmental inquiry was conducted  and ultimately by an order dated  1/5/92  the  respondent  was dismissed from service. 
</p> 

<p id="p_5">  3. The  respondent  thereafter  raised a dispute and  ultimately approached  the  Labour  Court,  Junagadh  and  after  hearing the concerned parties and after perusal of  the evidence, by an  award  dated  16/10/99,  the  Labour  Court  quashed  and  set  aside the order dated 28/7/1993  whereby the respondent was dismissed  from  the  service.  It  was  directed by the Labour Court that the respondent  should  be  reinstated  in  service  with  continuity  of  service and 70% back wages. 
</p> 

<p id="p_6"> 4. Learned  advocate  Mr.Jhaveri,  appearing for the  petitioner has submitted that the impugned order  is  not  just  and  proper  for  the  reason that the Labour Court  should not have directed the  petitioner  to  award  back  wages  to the extent of 70% ,especially when it was found  that  the  respondent  had  not  issued  tickets  to   36  passengers.  He has also submitted that even in the past,  several   punishments   had   been   inflicted  upon  the  respondent and, therefore, the Labour  Court  should  not  have shown any sympathy to the respondent. 
</p> 

<p id="p_7"> 5. On  the  other  hand,  learned  advocate   Mr.Jadeja  appearing  for  the  respondent  has vehemently submitted  that the order of dismissal was unjust and  improper  and  therefore,  the  Labour  Court  had rightly set aside the  order of dismissal.  It has been submitted  by  him  that  the   respondent  was  going  to  issue  tickets  to  the  passengers boarded from Bhad, but before tickets  can  be  issued, the  bus  was  checked at Kutiyana.  According to  the learned advocate, distance between Bhad and  Kutiyana  is hardly  7  km.    and the said distance can be covered  within about 7 to 10 minutes and at the time when the bus  was checked, the respondent was issuing  tickets  to  the  concerned passengers.   It has been submitted by him that  the respondent had no  intention  to  misappropriate  the  amount received  from  the  passengers.   He has drawn my  attention  to  the  fact  that  the  respondent  had  not  received  any  amount  by way of fare from the passengers  who were not issued tickets.  Had the  intention  of  the  respondent   been  to  misappropriate  the  fund  of  the  petitioner-corporation,   the   respondent   would   have  recovered  the fare and would not have issued the tickets  to the concerned passengers.  He  has  further  submitted  that the punishments inflicted upon the respondent in the  past  were  not of substantial nature because in no case,  there was a charge against the respondent with regard  to  misappropriation of  funds  of  the  petitioner.  In some  cases in the past, he could not issue the tickets but  at  the  same  time,  he had also not recovered fare from the  concerned passengers.  
</p> 

<p id="p_8">   5. In the circumstances, it has been  submitted  by  the  learned  advocate  appearing  for the respondent that the  petition should be rejected. 
</p> 

<p id="p_9"> 6. I have heard learned advocates and have also perused  the impugned award.   It  is  not  in  dispute  that  the  distance between  Bhad  and  Kutiyana is hardly 7 km.  It  appears  that  it  would  have  been  difficult  for  the  respondent  to issue tickets to all the passengers within  a very short period of about 5 to 10 minutes.  It is also  not in dispute that the respondent had not  received  the  fare  from  the  concerned  passengers and, therefore, it  cannot be  said  that  the  respondent  had  a  dishonest  intention of misappropriating money of the petitioner. 
</p> 

<p id="p_10"> 7. Upon perusal of the default card, it  is  also  clear  that  even  in  the  past,  whenever  the  respondent was  punished,  he  was  not  punished  for  the   charge   of  misappropriation but he was punished because he could not  issue tickets to certain passengers.   
</p>  

<p id="p_11">  8. Upon careful consideration, it appears  that  the  order  of dismissal was in fact very harsh as observed by  the Labour Court.  It however, appears  that  the  Labour  Court  should  not  have reinstated the respondent with a  direction to pay 70% back wages.  It  is  true  that  the  respondent  was little slow or negligent becuase he could  not complete his work within the time which was available  at his disposal.  In my opinion, ends of justice will  be  served  if  the  respondent is reinstated in service with  less back wages so that this would  set  an  example  not  only for  him  but  also  for  other  conductors.  In the  circumstances, the  award  is  modified  so  far  as  the  payment of  back wages is concerned.  It is directed that  30% back wages should be given to the respondent  and  he  should be reinstated in service forthwith.  
</p> 

<p id="p_12">   6. With the above directions, the petition is partly  allowed.  Rule  is  made absolute to the above extent. No  order as to costs. 
</p>
