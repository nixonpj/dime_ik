JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">1            Appellant   has   been   found   guilty   under   Sections 
66/192­<a href="/doc/785258/" id="a_1">A of Motor Vehicles Act</a> and has been fined Rs. 2,500/­ 
by learned Special Metropolitan Magistrate.  Such conviction and 
sentence is under challenge. 
</p>


<p id="p_2">2            At   the   very   outset,   I   would   like   to   mention   that 
conviction, as per record, is consequent upon the plea of guilt of 
accused.     However,   appellant   has   taken   a   typical   stand. 
According to him, he had, though, gone to the Court of learned 
Special Metropolitan Magistrate on the date fixed and had come 
along with the carbon copy of the challan yet according to him, 



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                            1 (CA No. 05/2008)</span>
 he never pleaded guilty before the Court.  It has been argued that 
he was simply told by the  Naib Court that Court had imposed a 
penalty of Rs. 2,500/­ and amount was deposited by him in order 
to secure release of the bus in question. 
</p>


<p id="p_3">3               Sh. Arvind Kumar, learned counsel for appellant has 
contended that appellant never confessed before the Court.   It 
has been argued that even the substance of accusation was never 
explained and the alleged signatures of convict on Summary Trial 
Register have been vehemently disputed.  So much so, it has been 
contended   that   convict   would   have   no   objection   if   signatures 
appearing on Summary Trial Register are ordered to be compared 
by   forensic   lab   with   the   specimen   signatures   or   the   admitted 
signatures   on   the   challan.     Last   but   not   the   least,   it   has   been 
contended   that even   otherwise  case   was  tried  in  a  mechanical 
manner by affixing a rubber stamp which was in gross violation 
of established rules and norms.  
</p>


<p id="p_4">4               Undoubtedly,   as   per<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_2">   Chapter   XXI   of   Criminal 
Procedure   Code</a>   (hereinafter   referred   to   as   Code)   and   <a href="/doc/86587000/" id="a_3">Section 
208</a>   of   Motor   Vehicles   Act,   such   type   of   offences   can   be   tried 
summarily.  However, procedure of trial of such cases is virtually 
the same as is prescribed for trial of summons cases under Chapter 
XXI of Code.  
</p>

<p id="p_5">5               <a href="/doc/154324/" id="a_4">Section 263</a> of Code reads as under:

                shall  enter,  in   such  form   as   the   State

           of   sub­section  (1)   of   <a href="/doc/785258/" id="a_5">section   260</a>,   the 
           value of the property in respect of which 
           the offence has been committed: 
</p><p id="p_13">           (g)   the   plea   of   the   accused   and   his

<p id="p_17">6          It would be also worthwhile to extract <a href="/doc/429078/" id="a_6">Sections 251</a> 
&amp; <a href="/doc/1750806/" id="a_7">252</a> of Code which read as under:

            appears   or   is   brought   before   the 
            Magistrate, the particulars of the offence 
            of which he is accused shall be stated to 
            him,  and  he  shall  be   asked  whether  he 
            pleads guilty or has any defence to make, 
            but it shall not be necessary to frame a 
            formal charge.

<blockquote id="blockquote_2">            Conviction   on   plea   of   guilty­  If   the 
            accused pleads guilty, the Magistrate shall 
            record   the  plea  as nearly   as possible  in  
            the words used by the accused  and may, 
            in his discretion, convict him thereon. 
</blockquote>


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                          3 (CA No. 05/2008)</span>
<p id="p_18"> 6              On careful perusal of the Summary Trial Register, it is 
noticed   that   there   is   no   requisite   compliance   with   respect   to 
aforesaid   mandatory   provisions   of   law.     Full   name,   parentage, 
age   and   residential   address   of   the   accused   have   not   been 
mentioned. It also becomes evident that accusation has not been 
explained   to   accused   in   the   desired   manner.     It   is   incumbent 
upon   the   Magistrate   to   record   the   plea   of   guilt   as   nearly   as 
possible in the words used by the accused.  Affixing rubber stamp 
does   not   reflect   application   of   mind   and   it   rather   seems 
mechanical.   For the moment, I am not even entering into the 
fact whether the relevant entry contains signatures of convict or 
not.   Suffice it to say that a bare perusal of the relevant entry 
clearly and evidently indicates that even if there was such plea, it 
was not recorded in terms of the mandatory provisions of law 
which has resulted in serious miscarriage of justice.   So much so, 
learned trial court had though imposed a fine of Rs. 2,500/­ yet it 
was not mentioned as to what would be fate in case such fine was 
not deposited as the requisite column in this regard has been left 
blank.  
</p>

<p id="p_19">7              Sh. Arvind Kumar, learned counsel has also argued 
that even otherwise challan could not have been prepared by a 
police official of the rank of ASI.   He has contended that as per 
the   directiond   given   by   Hon'ble   Supreme   Court   in   the   case   of 
<a href="/doc/69408974/" id="a_8">M.C. Mehta vs. Union of India</a>, AIR 1998 SC 190, powers could 
only have been exercised by a team headed by SDM.  I have seen 
the aforesaid judgment and I have no hesitation in holding that 
learned   counsel   has   completely   misread   the   judgment.     In   its 
order, Apex Court, in Para­A has given directions to police and all 


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                              4 (CA No. 05/2008)</span>
 the   authorities   entrusted   with   the   administration   and 
enforcement of <a href="/doc/785258/" id="a_9">Motor Vehicles Act</a> and generally with the control 
of the traffic to ensure certain things.  Simultaneously, in Para­A 
Sub   Para   (g),   it   has   been   observed   that   for   the   purpose   of 
enforcing   these   directions   flying   squad   would   be   made   to   be 
headed by an SDM.  Thus, in the first place, the directions are to 
be followed by the concerned police and traffic authorities and 
the role of SDM is only of supervision.  It does not mean that if a 
particular police official or traffic official, though fully competent 
to book a person for violation under <a href="/doc/785258/" id="a_10">Motor Vehicle Act</a>, notices a 
violation but cannot book such person unless SDM is also present 
at  the   spot.    Role  of   SDM   is  of   supervisory   in  nature   and  the 
competent police official and traffic official can certainly book an 
offender   at   the   spot   in   case   they   notice   any   violation   of   the 
directives of Hon'ble Supreme Court. 
</p>

<p id="p_20">8              In view of aforesaid discussion, impugned conviction 
and sentence is set aside and appellant/accused is given a chance 
to   appear   before   learned   Special   Metropolitan   Magistrate   on 
16.10.2008 at 2.00 PM.  Learned Special Metropolitan Magistrate 
would   proceed   as   per   provisions   of   law   and   would   follow   the 
necessary procedure in case accused wants to contest the matter. 
In case, accused still wants to plead guilty then accusation would 
be   explained   and   the   plea   of   guilt   would   be   recorded   in 
consonance with the provisions of law as discussed above. 
</p>

<p id="p_21">9              Appeal stands allowed in aforesaid terms.   Fine be 
refunded.
