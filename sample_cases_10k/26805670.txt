      Bengaluru-562123.                         ... Respondents

(By Smt. H.R. Renuka, Advocate for R-1
Notice to R2 is dispensed with
vide order dated 09.03.2011)

     This MFA is filed under <a href="/doc/93665491/" id="a_1">section 173(1)</a> of MV Act against
the judgment and award dated 03.07.2009 passed in MVC
No.6589/2007 on the file of Cheif Judge, Court of Small
Causes and Principal MACT, SCCH-1, Bengaluru, partly
allowing the Claim Petition for compensation and seeking
enhancement of compensation and etc.,

      This MFA coming on for Final Hearing this day, the
court delivered the following:-

                        JUDGMENT
</pre>

<p id="p_1">      This    appeal   by    the     claimant     challenges      the

judgment and award dated 03.07.2009 rendered by

Principal    M.A.C.T   for   allowing M.V.C.No.6589/2007

whereby a compensation of Rs.25,000/- with interest at

the rate of 6% per annum has been awarded. Challenge

is on the ground of inadequacy of compensation.


</p><p id="p_2">      2.     The brief facts of the case stated are: In a

vehicular accident involving the rash and negligent

driving of Mahindra Luggage Auto bearing Registration

No.KA 52/412, the claimant a minor boy of 15 years
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                               -3-</span>




suffered grievous injuries. The claimant represented by

the minor guardian, had filed             a Claim Petition in

M.V.C.No.6589/2007; that was stoutly resisted by the

insurer by filing written statement.


</p><p id="p_3">      3.      Going by the evidentiary matter on record

and keeping in view the rival pleadings of the parties, the

M.A.C.T. has made impugned judgment and award.


</p><p id="p_4">      4.      The   learned   counsel      for   the   claimant

vehemently contends that the award of compensation is

too much on the meager side and therefore, indulgence

of this Court is warranted.
</p>
<p id="p_5">
</p><p id="p_6">      5.      The panel counsel for the respondent-insurer

vehemently opposes any enhancement of compensation

stating that the M.A.C.T has duly considered the medical

evidence      and   therefore,      has    leniently   awarded

compensation of Rs.25,000/-, which does not merit any

alteration.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                              -4-</span><p id="p_7">




</p><p id="p_8">     6.    I have heard the learned counsel for the

claimant and the learned counsel for the insurer. I have

perused the appeal papers.
</p>
<p id="p_9">
</p><p id="p_10">     7.    The guardian of the claimant who was

examined as PW-1, has spoken about the injury with his

rustic wisdom. However, the Doctor, who was examined

as PW-2 has specifically stated about the nature of 5

injuries sustained by the minor boy and the treatment

given to him.
</p>
<p id="p_11">
</p><p id="p_12">      8.   Apparently the award appears to be on the

lower side and therefore, by making an addition of

Rs.10,000/- to what has been already awarded, the

same graduates to a just and reasonable compensation.


</p><p id="p_13">     9.    In the above circumstances, the appeal is

favoured in part; the impugned judgment and award are

modified   by   enhancing          the   compensation   from

Rs.25,000/- to Rs.35,000/- (Rupees thirty five thousand

only) with interest at the rate of 6% per annum; the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                            -5-</span>




condition for bank deposit is relaxed and the amount is

to be released in favour of the claimant immediately.


</p><p id="p_14">        Costs made easy.
</p>
<p id="p_15">

</p><p id="p_16">                                        Sd/-
</p><p id="p_17">                                       JUDGE
