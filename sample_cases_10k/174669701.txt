<p id="p_5">     5. Heard the arguments of the learned Public Prosecutor and
the learned counsel for the accused.    On perusal of the oral and

each other, hence, they are taken up together for             common
discussion to avoid repetition of facts.</blockquote>


<p id="p_6">     8.     During the course of arguments, the learned Public
Prosecutor has submitted that in order to prove the prosecution
case totally 8 witnesses are examined as PWs-1 to 8 and 9
documents are marked as Exs.P1 to P9. The evidence of PWs-1 to
3 are very much important in the present case in order to bring
home the guilt of the accused.         The mother of the victim girl is
examined as PW1, PW2 who is none other than the complainant
and the father of the victim girl has set criminal law into motion
and PW3 is the victim girl herself.           PW4 and PW5 are the
circumstantial witnesses.    Though PWs-1 to 5 have totally turned
hostile to the prosecution case, particularly the victim girl/Pw3
has turned hostile to the prosecution case,        though the learned
counsel for the accused subjected PWs-1 to 5 for cross-
examination but, nothing is elicited to discredit their evidence of
but it settled position of law that the evidence has to be weighed
but not counted. Under these circumstances considering the oral
and documentary evidence furnished by the prosecution to convict
the accused in the interest of justice and equity.
</p>
<p id="p_7">     9.    Per contra, the learned counsel for the accused submitted
that the prosecution has miserably failed to prove the guilt of the
accused beyond all reasonable doubt. The prosecution witnesses
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                    6               Spl CC No.473/2016</span>


particularly PWs-1 to 3 have totally turned hostile to the
prosecution case and they have not supported the case of the
prosecution that the accused has committed the alleged act of
aggravated penetrative sexual assault on the victim girl. With these
the prosecution failed to prove the guilt of the accused beyond all
reasonable doubt, thereby the accused is entitled for acquittal.
Hence, the learned counsel for the accused       prays to acquit the
accused in the interest of justice and equity.
</p>

<p id="p_8">        10.     I have perused the oral and documentary evidence
furnished by the prosecution before this court. The prosecution in
order to prove its case has examined as many as 8 witnesses, out
of them,        PW1 is the mother of the victim girl,      PW2 is the
complainant        as well as the father of the victim girl who set
criminal law into motion by lodging a complaint. PW3 is the victim
girl herself,    PWs-4 and 5 are the circumstantial witnesses, PW6 is
the WPC who took the victim girl to Bowring hospital for medical
examination, PW7 is the Police Inspector who submitted charge-
sheet     before the court and PW8 is the PSI who received the
complaint and registered a case in Cr.No.664/2016 and submitted
FIR to the court and to his higher officers.
</p>

<p id="p_9">        11. Now coming to the evidence of the prosecution witnesses,
PW1 who is the mother of the victim girl and PW2 who is the father
of the victim girl have deposed that, victim girl is their daughter.
She knows the accused.        Now [as on 11.6.2018], the    age of the
victim girl is 18 years and during the year 2016, the age of the
victim girl was 16 years and she was studying in I PUC. The victim
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                    7                 Spl CC No.473/2016</span>


girl used to go to the college at 8.30 A.M. and she used to return
by 5-5.30 P.M. In front of their house, there were some bachelors
boys residing in a room, but she [PW1] does not know whether the
accused was also residing in the said room because she was also
going to work. When thier daughter/victim girl had to go to the
college, she had to pass through the room where the boys were
residing.    PW1 and PW2 have further deposed that, they do not
know anything about this case and they have not given any
statement.     One day their daughter/ victim girl went out of the
house and did not return in the night.        So, PW2 had given a
complaint. On the next day, her daughter/victim girl came back to
the    house   and   PW2   had    brought   the      victim   girl   from
Rajagopalanagara Bus stop.       But, they [PW1 and PW2] had not
questioned her daughter/victim girl as to where she had gone or
with whom she had gone.          Other than this, they do not have
anything to say.       At this stage, the learned Public Prosecutor
prayed this court to treat these witnesses as hostile and sought
permission to cross-examine them. After getting permission of this
court, the learned Public Prosecutor subjected these witnesses
[PW1 and PW2] to         cross-examination.       But, in their cross-
examination, PWs-1 and 2 have denied that they has given their
statement before the police. The statement of PW1 given before the
complainant police is marked as Ex.P1 and the statement given by
PW2 before the complainant police is marked as Ex.P2. They have
also   denied that as their daughter/victim girl is residing         with
them and as because her [victim girl] future will be spoiled, they
are deposing falsely before this court.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                  8               Spl CC No.473/2016</span>


<p id="p_10">     12. PW3 is the victim girl herself. In her evidence she has
deposed that, during the year 2016, she was studying                in
10th standard. She has not identified the accused in the
accused platform kept in the court hall.   She has denied that the
accused was not residing in any room near her house.              The
accused has not taken her anywhere and he has not committed
anything and she do not know anything about this case.            The
police have not taken her to the hospital or to the court.    At this
stage, the learned Public Prosecutor prayed to treat this witness as
PW3 and sought permission to cross-examine this witness. After
getting permission of this court, the learned Public Prosecutor
subjected this witness [PW3] for cross-examination.           In her
cross-examination also, this witness has denied that the accused
has committed sexual act on her and she has given her statement
as per Ex.P3. She has also denied that she has given statement
before the SJPU as per Ex.P4. Further she has also denied that she
has given her statement before the Learned       Magistrate      under
Sec.164 of <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_12">Cr.P.C</a>, as per Ex.P6. She has also denied that in order
to help the accused she is deposing falsely before this court.
Hence, nothing worth is elicited from the cross-examination of PW3
to prove the guilt of the accused beyond all reasonable doubt.
</p>

<p id="p_11">     13. PWs-4 and 5 are the circumstantial witnesses.        PWs-4
and 5 are the relatives of the victim girl and her family. They have
deposed in their chief examination evidence that, they do not know
anything about this case. At this stage, the learned Public
Prosecutor prayed to treat this witness as PW3 and sought
permission to cross-examine this witness. After getting permission
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                    9             Spl CC No.473/2016</span>


of this court, the learned Public Prosecutor subjected these
witnesses [PW4 and PW5] for cross-examination.      In their cross-
examination, these witnesses have denied that they have given
their statements before the complainant police. The statement
given by PW4 before the complainant police is marked as Ex.P7
and the statement given by PW5 before the complainant police is
marked as Ex.P8.
</p>

<p id="p_12">     14. PWs-6 to 8 are the police official witnesses. Among them,
PW6 is the then WPC of the complainant police station, who has
deposed that, as per the instruction of the PSI, on 3.8.2016, she
had taken the victim girl to Bowring Hospital for medical
examination. After the medical examination of the victim girl, this
witness has collected the Report and also 10 articles seized from
the victim girl and produced them before the PSI     and given her
statement.     This witness was cross-examined by the learned
defence counsel. In her cross-examination by the learned defence
counsel, Pw6 has      denied that to help the victim girl, she is
deposing falsely.    Hence, PW6 has discharged her official duty as
per the instructions of the PSI.
</p>

<p id="p_13">     15.     PW7 is the then Police Inspector of the complainant
police station who deposed that, on 26.10.2016, he received the
case file pertaining to this case from CW18. CW18 had completed
the investigation.    As seen from the   investigation papers,   the
accused had committed the crime.       Hence, he [PW7] submitted
charge-sheet to the court.     This witness was cross-examined by
the learned defence counsel. In his cross-examination, this witness

[PW7] has stated that,      in order to help the victim girl, he is
deposing falsely. Hence, PW7 has discharged his statutory duty.

<p id="p_14">     16. PW8 is the then ASI of the complainant police station.
He has deposed that, on 2.8.2016, he was in the morning shift, the
complainant of this case at about 11 A.M., came to the police
station and lodged a written complaint, he [PW8] received the said
complaint and registered a case in Cr.No.664/2016 and prepared
FIR and sent it to this Hon'ble court and to his higher officials.
He has identified the FIR as Ex.P9. He has handed over the case
file to CW18 for further investigation.      This witness has not been
cross-examined by the learned defence counsel. Hence, PW8 has
discharged his statutory duty


</p><p id="p_15">     17. On consideration of the evidence discussed above,          the
material witnesses i.e., Pws-1 to 3 totally turned hostile to the
prosecution case and they have not supported the case of the
prosecution that, the accused kidnapped the victim girl from her
the custody of her parents, thereafter the accused took her to his
house and kept kumkum on her forehead and got her marriage and
committed aggravated penetrative sexual assault on her.          As the
material witnesses i..e, PWs-1 to 3 being the mother of the victim
girl, father of the victim girl and the victim girl herself turned
hostile to the prosecution case,        there is no material to link the
accused to the alleged crime.   With these observations, I hold that
the prosecution has failed to prove the guilt of the accused beyond
all reasonable doubts, and, the accused is entitled for acquittal.
Hence, I answer     Point Nos.1 and 2 in the Negative.
