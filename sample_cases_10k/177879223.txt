                               ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">        This petition is filed by the petitioner/accused

No.1 under <a href="/doc/1290514/" id="a_2">Section 439</a> of Cr.P.C. seeking his release on

bail of the offences punishable under <a href="/doc/455468/" id="a_3">Sections 307</a>, <a href="/doc/1517318/" id="a_4">436</a>

and <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_5">302</a> of IPC, registered in respondent - police station

Crime No.288/2017.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">        2.      Brief facts of the prosecution case that the

mother of the deceased lodged the complaint, wherein

she has stated that on 14.07.2017 after completion of

work and return to their residence and had dinner and

after    that     they   all   asleep   by   9.00p.m.   itself.

Complainant herself and her son had slept over the

ground floor and her daughter had slept on the bed and

by 11.30p.m. her son shouted at the top of the voice by

calling fire, fire, all of a sudden she woke up and seen
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                              3</span>



that fire was covered to whole house. But at that time

somebody wandering near the window. Afterwards, all

came near to the front door and shouted loudly and

tried to open the lock of the door but it seems that from

the outside somebody locked the door.       Immediately,

her son called his friend by name one Mr.Chidanand

over the phone informing the causing of fire, his friend

came to her house and opened the door lock and saved

them by admitting all the people to private Hospital. On

the basis of the said complaint, case came to be

registered for the said offences.
</p>
<p id="p_4">
</p><p id="p_5">     3.    Heard the arguments of the learned counsel

appearing for the petitioner/accused and also the

learned High Court Government Pleader appearing for

the respondent-State.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                   4</span><p id="p_6">



</p><p id="p_7">        4.      Learned counsel for the petitioner during the

course of his arguments has submitted that there are

no direct witnesses to the incident and case of the

prosecution rests on circumstantial evidence. It is also

submitted       that    five   days    after   the    incident,   the

complainant given the statement raising suspicion

against the petitioner. Regarding the statement of

Chidanand,        the   friend    of   the     deceased,    he    has

submitted that it is recorded after two days, hence,

there is delay in recording the said statement. He has

further submitted that petitioner has filed the suit

against the complainant and the said suit is also still

pending. Looking to these materials there is no prima-

facie    case    and    there    is    delay    in    recording   the

statements.         Hence,      submitted      that    by   imposing

reasonable conditions, petitioner may be enlarged on

bail.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                5</span><p id="p_8">



</p><p id="p_9">     5.     Per contra, learned High Court Government

Pleader, during the course of his arguments has

submitted that, the statement of Chidanand, who came

to the house, opened the door, tried to save the injured

as well as the deceased and shifted to the hospital, is

recorded after two days, wherein he clearly stated about

the persons, who came to the house for setting fire and

ran away and he also identified the petitioner. Learned

HCGP also submitted that there is recovery of the Can

at the instance of the petitioner in the presence of

panch     witnesses   during       investigation.   He   also

submitted that there is motive.         Hence, he submitted

that prima-facie material has been collected during

investigation, therefore, petitioner is not entitled to be

released on bail.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                              6</span><p id="p_10">



</p><p id="p_11">     6.     I have perused the grounds urged in the bail

petition, FIR, complaint and the entire charge sheet

material.
</p>
<p id="p_12">
</p><p id="p_13">     7.     Looking to the materials collected by the

Investigating Officer during investigation, the statement

of Chidanand is recorded two days after the incident,

wherein he has stated about the persons, who came to

the said house and running out of the house, when he

went to the said house as requested by the deceased.

His statement shows that he has seen the persons. The

prosecution    material   also   shows   that   Chidanand

identified the present petitioner.   During investigation,

I.O. has recorded the voluntary statement of the

petitioner, wherein he has stated that if he is taken to

the place, he will take out and produce the Can, which

was used for throwing the oil on the house of

complainant.    Accordingly, the Police have seized the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                             7</span>



Can at the instance of the petitioner in the presence of

panch witnesses. Looking to these materials collected

by the prosecution, I am of the opinion that it is not a

case for exercising discretion in favour of the petitioner.

Hence, petition is hereby rejected.
