</p><p id="p_2">2.        Suit filed  proceeds on the premises that  the plaintiff was a 

body   corporate   constituted   under   <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_2">State   Bank   of   India   Act</a>,   1955

the plaintiff vide application dated 10.10.2004 for grant of loan facility 

in   connection   with   the   aforesaid  business   and   on   such   request,   the 

plaintiff   granted   to     the   defendant   No.1   a   cash   credit   (special

defendant   No.1   as   borrower   and   the   defendant   No.2   as   guarantor, 

signed and executed the following loan and guarantee documents on 

14.10.2004 : 
</p>
<p id="p_3">

</p><p id="p_4">(i)     Defendant No.1 signed and executed a demand promissory note 

        for Rs.3 Lacs in favour of the defendant No.2, who in turn duly 

        endorsed the same in favour the plaintiff, promising therein to 

        pay on demand to the plaintiff a sum of Rs.3 Lacs alongwith 

        interest @ 10.50% p.a. with monthly rests and the said demand 

        promissory   note  was  duly delivered by  the defendants to the 

        plaintiff vide DP note delivery letter dated 14.10.2004;

        hypothecation of goods and other assets dated 14.10.2004 for 

        Rs.3 Lacs in favour of the plaintiff, wherein the defendant No.1 

        hypothecated   in   favour   of   the   plaintiff   her   entire   stocks 

        consisting of electronic goods etc.  and further agreed therein to 

        pay interest at State Bank of India advance rate with a minimum 

        of 10.50% p.a. with monthly rests; and

</p><p id="p_6">(iii)   Defendant No.2 as guarantor signed and executed a guarantee 

        agreement dated 14.10.2004 for Rs.3 Lacs promising therein  to

         pay the outstanding amount in respect of the cash credit limit of 

        Rs.3 Lacs besides interest, costs, charges, expenses etc. to the 

        plaintiff.
</p>
<p id="p_7">

</p><p id="p_8">                 Defendant No.1 availed the cash credit limit of Rs.3 Lacs 

but became highly irregular in conduct of the same and neglected to 

adhere   to   the   financial   discipline   and   regularity   in   repayment. 

Defendant Nos.1 &amp; 2 however signed and executed revival letter dated 

20.12.2006 acknowledging their liability to the plaintiff, to repay the 

outstanding amount in respect of the said cash credit limit granted to 

the defendant No.1 by the plaintiff.   Since the defendants remained 

irregular in conduct of the said cash credit facility and neglected to 

maintain its financial discipline despite several reminders and requests 

and   the   promises   and   the   assurances   made,   the   plaintiff   sent   legal 

demand notice dated 22.4.2008 calling upon the defendants to repay 

the   outstanding   amount   but   the   defendants   failed   to   liquidate   the 

outstanding amount.   As per the books of account maintained by the 

plaintiff in their regular course of business,  a sum of Rs.4,24,841.23 

inclusive of interest calculated upto 31.1.2008, was due and payable by 

the defendants to the plaintiff.  As per the plaintiff bank practice and 

procedure,   no   interest   was   debited   in   the   subject   account   from 

Suit No.333/09                                                                       Page 4/13
 1.2.2008   onwards   but   the   defendants   were  liable   to  pay   interest   as 

agreed @ 12.75% w.e.f. 16.2.2008 and 12.50% w.e.f. 27.2.2008 with 

monthly rests from 1.2.2008 to 29.2.2008, 12.50% p.a. with monthly 

rests from 1.3.2008 to 23.7.2008 and as such, a sum of Rs. 26,090/­ 

was due and payable by the defendants towards accrued interest from 

1.2.2008 to 23.7.2008.   Thus, according to the plaintiff, a sum of Rs.

4,24,841.23  was due and payable by the defendants to the plaintiff 

jointly and/or severally.   According to the plaintiff, defendants were 

liable to the plaintiff accrued interest on the outstanding amount as per 

the RBI guidelines and the present rate of interest in the said account 

was 12.50% p.a. with monthly rests.  Hence, the suit.



</p><p id="p_9">3.        Defendants in the written statement filed, save and except the 

admissions   made,   while   denying   the   assertions   and   the   allegations 

made in the plaint, took the preliminary objections viz.  suit filed was 

gross abuse and misuse of the process of law and had been filed with 

ulterior motives with intention to harass the defendants on the basis of 

manipulated and fabricated documents; suit was barred by limitation; 

suit   was   without   any   cause   of   action   and   therefore,   liable   to   be 

dismissed  U/o  7 R.11  CPC;  plaintiff had not approached the Court 

with clean hands and was guilty of suppressing the material facts; suit 

Suit No.333/09                                                                       Page 5/13
 was liable to be dismissed, as the same had not been signed, verified 

and instituted by a competent person on behalf of the plaintiff bank 

and   that,   Sh.   M.K.   Kalra,   alleged   Chief   Manager   and/or   Principal 

Officer of the plaintiff was not authorized person to do so; plaintiff 

bank had manipulated and fabricated the documents; and the statement 

of   account   did   not   reflect   the   true   picture   of   the   account   of   the 

defendants,   as   the   said   statement   of   account   appeared   to   be 

manipulated and fabricated.  On merits, the defendants have also taken 

the plea that the defendants were made to sign many documents in 

blank at the time of availing the loan facility and the plaintiff bank had 

manipulated and fabricated the said documents, thereby filling up the 

blank documents, got signed from the defendants without letting them 

know   the   true   import   and   understand   the   substance   of   the   said 

documents and that, the writing appearing on the said revival letters 

relied upon was not of the defendants but of someone on behalf of the 

plaintiff   bank,   without   the   explicit   consent   of   the   defendants.   Also 

according to the defendants, the statement of account relied upon by 

the plaintiff bank, did not reflect the true picture of the account of the 

defendants, as the same appeared to be manipulated and fabricated and 

that, the defendants were not liable to pay any interest, as alleged.

                  In   his   deposition   PW1   has   categorically   deposed   that 

during the period from November 2003 till April, 2007, he was posted 

as Branch Manager and Principal Officer of the plaintiff bank at its 

Pushpa Bhawan Branch and acquainted with the facts of the case, as he 

had dealt with the account of defendant No.1. He has also categorically 

deposed that he had seen the defendants writing and signing and could 

identify   their   signatures   and   that,   the   defendants   had   signed   and 

executed the loan documents in his presence.  In his such deposition, 

he   has   also   categorically   deposed   that   vide   application   dated 

10.10.2004 Ex.PW1/1, the defendant No.1 had approached the plaintiff 

for   grant   of   loan   and   on   such   request,   a   cash   credit   (special 

hypothecation) limit of Rs.3 Lacs was granted to defendant No.1 and 

in   consideration   thereof,   the   defendant   No.1   as   borrower   and   the 

defendant   No.2   as   guarantor   had   executed   the   loan   and   guarantee 

documents on 14.10.2004, which were Exs.PW1/2 to PW1/5. Though 

cross­examined,   I   find that  his  such deposition  has gone unshaken. 

PW1   during   cross,   has   also   reiterated   that   all   the   documents 

Exs.PW1/1   to   PW1/5   were   signed   and   executed   in   his   presence. 

During cross, though a suggestion has come to be given that Exs.PW1/ 

to   PW1/5   were   got   signed   in   blank   from   the   defendants,   mere 

suggestion does not establish such plea of the defendant.  But for such 

Suit No.333/09                                                                     Page 10/13
 suggestion, the defendants on their part have not led any evidence to 

establish   their   plea   that   they   signed   any   blank   documents.     Mere 

suggestion to the contrary is therefore, of no avail.  Deposition of PW1 

does establish the fact that on 14.10.2004 on being approached by the 

defendants,   the   plaintiff   granted   loan   facility   of   Rs.3   Lacs   to   the 

defendant No.1 and in consideration thereof, the defendant Nos. 1 and 

2   signed   and   executed   the   documents   Ex.PW1/2   and   PW1/3 

respectively.
</p>
<p id="p_28">                 PW2 in her deposition by way of affidavit Ex.PW2/A has 

deposed that from May 2007 till July, 2008, she was posted as the 

Branch Manager and the Principal Officer of the plaintiff at its Pushpa 

Bhawan   Branch   and   dealt   with  the  account   of   defendant  No.1   and 

therefore, was well acquainted with the facts of the case.  In her such 

deposition,  she  has  also categorically deposed that  defendant Nos.1 

and 2 signed and executed in her presence the Revival Letters dated 

13.10.2007   Exs.PW2/1  and  PW2/2,  acknowledging  their  liability  to 

repay the outstanding the loan amount in respect of the subject loan 

account.  During cross, she has also stated that Ex.PW2/1 was in her 

handwriting   alongwtih   the   date   appearing   on   the   document   i.e. 

13.10.2007, though admitting that in the said document Ex.PW2/1, she 

had used two different pens. Though, she was suggested that she used 

Suit No.333/09                                                                       Page 11/13
 two   different   pens   and   that   the   writings   were   incorporated   at   two 

different   times/intervals,  such  suggestion   is  unsubstantiated.   Merely 

because two different pens have come to be used while   filling the 

blanks   in   Ex.PW2/1,   it   does   not   attract   any   presumption   for   the 

documents   having   been   filled   up   at   different   points   of   time   or 

manipulated.  Needless to say, PW2 during cross, has explained that it 

could   be   due   to   change   of   refill.   She   has   similarly   deposed   for 

Ex.PW2/2.  I find the deposition of PW2 to be equally unshaken and 

unrebutted.   Depositions of PW1 and PW2 corroborate each other's 

version.     It   is  established therefrom  that  the defendant  No.1 as the 

borrower and the defendant No.2 as guarantor approached the plaintiff 

for grant of cash credit (special hypothecation) limit of Rs.3 Lacs and 

in   consideration   of   the   plaintiff   having   granted   the   said   loan,   the 

defendants signed and executed the loaning documents Ex.PW1/1 to 

Ex.PW1/5 and on 13.10.2007, the defendants also signed and executed 

the revival letters Ex.PW2/1 and Ex.PW2/2 respectively.  Statement of 

A/c Ex.PW3/1, which is duly certified under the Bankers' <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_3">Evidence 

Act</a>,   also   shows   that   the   defendant   No.1   operated   the   A/c   by 

withdrawals and deposits till 8.5.2006, which is debit entry by way of 

cheque.     Suit   was  filed on 11.8.2008.   Suit  filed is as such within 

limitation.   None of the entries in the statement of A/c Ex.PW3/1 is 

Suit No.333/09                                                                       Page 12/13
 shown to have incorrectly made and therefore, I have no reason to 

disbelieve   any   of   the   entries   made.     As   per   statement   of   A/c 

Ex.PW3/1,   a   sum   of   Rs.4,24,841.23   was   due   and   payable   as   on 

31.1.2008.     Loaning documents Exs.PW1/1 to PW1/5 also establish 

the claim of the plaintiff towards interest.  It establishes the suit claim. 

I have therefore, no hesitation in concluding that the suit is filed within 

limitation and the plaintiff is entitled to recover Rs.4,50,931.23 from 

the defendants jointly and/severally.  All the issues are answered in the 

affirmative accordingly.
