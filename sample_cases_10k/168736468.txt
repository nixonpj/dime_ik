 JUDGMENT
</pre>

<p id="p_1">                  Vide this Judgment I shall dispose off the suit of the plaintiff 

filed     for   recovery   of   Rs.2,90,832.55/­   with   pendente   lite   and   future 

interest @ 13.25 % per annum with monthly rests  from the date of filing 

of the suit till the realization of the amount along with costs.



</p><p id="p_2">2.                Facts   as   stated  in  the   plaint  are   as  follows:   The  plaintiff 

Bank has filed the present suit through its Chief Manager and Principal 

Officer, Sh. M.K. Kalra, stated to be authorized in this regard. It is the 

case of the plaintiff that the defendant no.1 approached the Prashant 

Vihar Branch of the plaintiff Bank for the grant of a Term Loan (Car 

Loan) for the purpose of purchasing a "Maruti Versa DX" car. A sum of 

Rs.3 lacs was granted to the defendant no.1 and defendant no.2 stood 

as a guarantor thereof. The defendant no.1 as the borrower and the 

defendant   no.2   as   the   guarantor   executed   the   following   documents 

towards the said loan:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">                  (i)     A Letter of Arrangement on form Annexure VII dated 

                  22.04.2005, in token of defendant no.1 receiving a sum of 

                  Rs.3 lacs.</blockquote><p id="p_3">

                   Annexure V dated 22.04.2005 wherein the defendant no.1 

                  agreed  to  create  a  first  charge  in  favour     of  the  plaintiff 

                  Bank.

</p><p id="p_6">                  (iv)     Declaration   signed   and   executed   by   the   defendant 

                  no.1 to the effect that he had not availed of any loan from 

                  any other Bank or official institution for the same purpose.



</p><p id="p_7">3.                Consequent to the Sanction of the said loan an account in 

the name of defendant no.1 was opened in the usual books of accounts 

of the plaintiff Bank wherein all the transactions and entries pertaining 

thereto   were   entered   in   the   regular,   ordinary   and   usual   course   of 

Banking   business.     Due   to   administrative   reasons,   the   aforesaid 

account   was   transferred   from   the   Prashant   Vihar   Branch   to   the 

Stressed Assets Resolution Centre of the plaintiff Bank at 23, Najafgarh 

Road, New Delhi­110015.

 became   highly   irregular   and   negligent   in   adhering   to   the   financial 

discipline   and   regularity   in   repayment.   The   defendants   signed   and 

executed Revival Letters dated 20.11.2007 acknowledging their liability 

to the plaintiff Bank to repay the outstanding amount in respect of the 

aforesaid loan amount.
</p>
<p id="p_10">

</p><p id="p_11">5.                Since the defendants remained irregular in conduct of the 

aforesaid Term Loan (Car Loan) facility and also neglected to maintain 

its   financial   discipline   despite   several   requests   and   reminder   of   the 

plaintiff   Bank   including   requests   /   reminders   made   vide   letter   dated 

22.11.2007,   the   plaintiff   Bank   sent   a   legal   demand   notice   dated 

15.07.2008   calling   upon   the   defendants   to   repay   the   outstanding 

amount. Despite receiving the said notice, defendants failed to liquidate 

the outstanding amount.

<p id="p_12">

</p><p id="p_13">6.                As  per   the  books  of   accounts   maintained   by  the   plaintiff 

Bank, a sum of Rs.2,70,563.55/­ is due and payable by the defendants 

to   the   plaintiff   Bank   inclusive   of   interest   calculated   upto   31.01.2008 

which the defendants have failed to pay despite repeated requests and 

reminders   of   the   plaintiff   Bank.   As   per   the   Bank's   practice   and

 procedure and instructions of the Reserve Bank of India no interest has 

been debited in the Term Loan (Car Loan) account from 01.02.2008 

onwards, but the defendants are still liable to pay interest as agreed till 

date of repayment on the outstanding amount. Thus the defendants are 

liable   to   pay   a   sum   of   Rs.20,269/­towards   the   accrued   interest   from 

01.02.2008   to   04.09.2008.   The   suit   amount   includes   the   aforesaid 

interest also. As per the guidelines of the Reserve Bank of India it is 

stated that the defendants are liable to pay the interest at the rate of 

13.25% per annum on the aforesaid amount.

the following preliminary objections:
</p>
<pre id="pre_2">                  (i)     Suit is barred by limitation.

                  (ii)    The   plaintiff   Bank   had   obtained   the   signatures   of

                  said documents have been filled up only prior to filing of the 
                  present suit.
</p>
<p id="p_17">                  (iii)   The claim of the plaintiff is sham and bogus both on 
                  the facts and the law applicable thereto. The plaintiff had 
                  failed   to   supply   the   regular   statement   of   account   of   the 


RBT No.434/14                State Bank of India Vs. Sunil Rajput &amp; Anr.     Page No. 5 of 21
                   Term   Loan   (Car   Loan)   related   to   the   said   account   as 
                  opened   and   maintained   by   the   plaintiff   to   the   defendant 
                  no.1.   Thus   the   defendant   was   precluded   from   either 
                  verifying the relevant statement of account or objecting to 
                  the unlawful and baseless entries made in it and also to the 
                  terms   and   condition   of   the   car   loan   facility.   The   date 
                  mentioned   in   para   no.3   of   the   plaint   with   regard   to   the 
                  opening of the said account was 16.04.2004 (application for 
                  the   grant   of   the   same   was   filed   with   the   Bank   on 
                  08.03.2004)   and not 22.04.2004. This it is apparent that 
                  the   Bank   officials   do   not   even   know   the   exact   date   of 
                  disbursement   of   the   loan   amount   and   therefore   the 
                  defendant is not bound by such fictitious claim.

                  agreement and an amount of Rs.1,89,000/­ (approximately) 
                  has been paid while only an amount of Rs.1,32,000/­ is due 
                  to the Bank in the loan period of five years. The plaintiff 
                  Bank has failed to provide suitable adjustment against the 
                  payments made by the defendant.

                  true and correct statement of account on the basis of which 
                  the defendant could verify such entries.
