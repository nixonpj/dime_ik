         04.06.2019                    W.P. No. 9697 (W) of 2019
sd

Ct 37.


                      Mr. Deb Kumar Deashi
                      Mr. P. Agarwal
                      Mr. S. Banerjee
                      Ms. Paramatia Miaty .. For the Petitioner

                      Mr. Indranil Roy
                      Mr. Sumit Kr. Roy ..For the M.C.I.

                      Mr. D.N. Maity
                      Mr. S. Roy           ..For the University


                               The petitioner is the doctor by profession and

                      passed the Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery

                      course in the year 2017. The petitioner participated in the

                      National Eligibility-cum-Entrance test-PG 2019, with the

                      intention to improve his qualification. The petitioner's

                      contention is that although two rounds of counseling for

                      admission were over, he had not been invited to appear for

                      counseling. The petitioner came to know of a notice dated

                      30th May 2019 issued by the University seeking admission of

                      candidates who had qualified in the second round counseling

                      of 2019 NEET-PG seats under the West Bengal State Quota

                      and Private Management Quota Seats. The petitioner was

                      present before the university at the time of counseling on 30th

                      May 2019 and 31st May 2019 but his turn to appear on the
                 2


counseling did not come. As a result, the petitioner made a

representation before the Registrar, West Bengal University of

Health Sciences on May 30, 2019 with a request to allow the

petitioner to participate in the counseling as several seats

were lying vacant.

         The petitioner relied on a Division Bench judgement

of this Court dated July 2, 2018 passed in AST 43 of 2018 (In

re: The State of West Bengal University of Health Sciences

and Ors vs. Dr. Paban Mandal and Ors.).

         The Hon'ble Division Bench of this Court in the said

matter while considering the appeals filed by the West Bengal

University of Health Sciences and Others against the

judgment and order dated June 26, 2018 passed by a learned

Single Judge of this Court in W.P. 7040 (W) of 2018 had

directed that the writ petitioner/respondent therein should</pre>

<p id="p_1">be given admission without prejudice to the rights and

conditions of the University as also the Board of Governors in

the said appeal. The said order was passed on similar facts

and circumstances as in this writ petition.

</p><p id="p_2">         It is submitted on behalf of the writ petitioner that

up to May 30, 2019 an interim order had been granted by

this Court whereby the entire admission process had been

stalled. It was only at the instance of in service candidate
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                   3</span>


that the said interim order was vacated by a Hon'ble Division

Bench of this Court in two appeals bearing MAT 716 of 2019

and MAT 718 of 2019.
</p>
<p id="p_3">          It appears that the interim order staying the entire

admission process of PG 2019 NEET had been continued

beyond the cut off date of May 31, 2019 and as such,

admittedly the University could not conduct the counseling

and continue with the admission process until May 30, 2019

when the interim order was vacated. The Hon'ble Division

Bench vacated the interim order in consideration of the

Regulation and the mandate of the Hon'ble Apex Court that

no other admission beyond May 31st of every year should be

allowed by the University and the cut off date was

mandatory. On this ground the interim was modified and the

Hon'ble Division Bench directed the University to complete

the admission process strictly in terms of the Regulation

2000. The University authorities admitted before this Court

that in the admission      notice and also in the Post Graduate

Medical Education Regulation, 2000 (hereinafter referred to

as the said Regulation), there is a provision for four rounds of

counseling before the closure of admission due to the interim

order that was passed only first two rounds of counseling

were completed.       The University thus failed to comply with
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                  4</span>


the Regulation to the effect that the counseling could not be

completed in four rounds as the cut off date was May 31st

2019.
</p>
<p id="p_4">          Mr. Indranil Roy, learned advocate appearing for

the Board of Governors submits that the petitioner does not

have a prima facie case in view of the fact that the petitioner

has ranked way below in the examination and he does not

come within the zone of consideration. He further submits

that the Regulations provided a cut off date that is 31st May

of every year as per mandate of the Hon'ble Apex Court and

this Court sitting in writ jurisdiction cannot extend such date

of admission. He further submits that there may be more

meritorious students than the petitioner who could have got

admission in the seats vacant had the University conducted

the mop up counseling and the college level counseling.

</p><p id="p_5">        It appears that the University could not complete the

 all four rounds of counseling as per the Regulations because

 of an interim order passed by this Court on 26th April 2019.

 The first round of counseling was done and the second

 round of counseling was partially completed when the

 interim order was passed staying the entire process.

 Thereafter, once the interim order was modified by the

 Hon'ble Division Bench the remaining part of the second
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                   5</span>


round of counseling was completed but due to shortage of

time because of the cut off date which was prescribed as

31st May, the University did not continue with the third and

4th round of counseling. According to the University those

candidates who did not merit in the first round and the

second round of counseling may have come up at the third

and forth round of counseling. However, due to shortage of

time the University was not in a position to declare the

surrendered seats and call the candidates for the next

round of counseling.      At the moment there are 153 vacant

seats.    The Hon'ble Division Bench in MAT 716 of 2019 has

stated while modifying the interim order that the admission

should be done in accordance with the said Regulations

which means that the process of mop up counseling and

college level counseling cannot be given a go by. Secondly,

it was due to an interim order staying the entire counseling

process    that   the   University   could   not   complete   the

counseling and could not follow the Regulation. Neither the

University nor the candidates who may have featured in the

third and fourth round of counseling can be faulted for this.

There is a catena of decisions on the point that the

relaxations could be granted in such cases where process of

appointment or admission       was stalled by interim orders of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                  6</span>


 Courts. The petitioner had made out an arguable case.

 Moreover, the decision of this Court in AST 43 of 2018,

 prima facie comes in aid of the petitioner. The contention of

 Mr. Roy about merit being compromised has also been

 taken up by the Division Bench wherein it has been held

 that only the petitioner there was diligent enough to

 approach the Court. In this case too the petitioner was

 present on 30th and 31st before the University expecting to

 be called for counseling and had intimated the authorities

 that he was desirable to take admission in the post vacant,

 but no other candidate with higher merit had approached

 either the University or this Court.
</p>
<p id="p_6">      The said order of the Division Bench was challenged

 by way of a Special Lave Petition by Board of Governors

 (Medical Counsel of India) before the Hon'ble Apex Court

 but the said case was disposed of keeping the question of

 law open,   meaning thereby, that the Hon'ble Apex Court

 did not wish to interfere with the order of Hon'ble Division

 Bench at that stage.
</p>
<p id="p_7">          Under such circumstances, in my prima facie

opinion the petitioner is also covered by the Division Bench

decision passed in Dr. Paban Mandal &amp; Ors. (supra). The

petitioner will be provisionally admitted by the University in a
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                   7</span>


College selected by the University within 5 days. University

will give such admission subject to the final result of this writ

petition. The petitioner shall not claim any equity in his

favour even if he qualifies or is allowed to take an

examination by the University. The point of maintainability of

this writ petition is kept open.
</p>
<p id="p_8">          Let affidavit in opposition be filed within a period of

six weeks; reply thereto, if any, be filed within a fortnight

thereafter.
</p>
<p id="p_9">          Let the matter appear in the list after completion of

affidavits.
</p>
<p id="p_10">          Liberty to mention.
</p>
<p id="p_11">          Mr. Roy prays for staying of operation of the said

order.
</p>
<p id="p_12">          Prayer considered and rejected.
</p>
<p id="p_13">          Urgent Photostat certified copy of this order be

given to the petitioner, if applied for.
</p>
