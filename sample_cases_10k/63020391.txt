<p id="p_13">13.          The learned trial Court determined points No.1 and 2 in favour

of the prosecution. However, points No.3 to 7 were determined against the

prosecution. Consequently, all the accused were acquitted of the charges

levelled against them vide judgment dated 3.7.2001.

</p><p id="p_14">14.          Feeling dissatisfied with the    judgment dated 3.7.2001, the

Delhi Special Police Establishment, CBI, ACB Chandigarh has directed the

present appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_15">15.         The learned counsel for the appellant has submitted that the

trial Court has given much stress to the provisions of <a href="/doc/741791/" id="a_19">Section 300</a> Cr.P.C.

and <a href="/doc/17858/" id="a_20">Article 20(2)</a> of the Constitution of India. It is submitted that there were

20 transactions in all and out of which the present ten transactions relates to

the period prior to the nationalization of the bank and other ten relate to the

period after nationalization of the bank. Separate case was initiated against

all the accused in respect of transitions after the nationalization by adding

<a href="/doc/1420677/" id="a_21">section 5(2)</a> of the Prevention of Corruption Act.         The accused were

convicted in that case after trial in respect of transactions after
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4"> Criminal Appeal No.S-1638-SBA of 2002                                 5</span>




nationalization of the bank that and the conviction was upheld by this Court

in criminal appeal Nos.542, 550 and 579- SB of 1995 vide order dated

13.7.2009 passed by this Court. Each and every transaction of granting loan

to each fictitious person call for a separate case. However, the case relating

to specific period can be clubbed together in view<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_22"> of the Code</a> of Criminal

Procedure. So, it cannot be said to be a case of double jeopardize.

Moreover, regarding that ten transactions, the present accused have been

convicted and their conviction upheld which relates to period after the

period of nationalization of the bank.      The same set of evidence and

witnesses have been produced in those cases and the present case and the

trial Court has acquitted the accused on flimsy grounds. The Document

Expert has clearly stated that the official of M/s P.S.Jain Motors have

prepared the fictitious document and have raised the loan from the bank.

The other accused have forged the insurance policy in order to advance the

loan. Mere fact that bank has not made any complaint is no ground to

acquit the accused. It is admitted fact that previously Punjab and Sind Bank

was a private bank. There was huge type of bungling in the bank and on

that account there was nationalization of the said bank along with other

banks. The report of the Government Expert has been ignored on flimsy

grounds.
</p>
<p id="p_16">16.         Counsel for the respondents-accused        were fair enough to

concede that the evidence against the present accused is similar to that of

evidence in earlier appeals, in which conviction of the present respondents-

accused have been upheld and which relates to the period after
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5"> Criminal Appeal No.S-1638-SBA of 2002                                  6</span>




nationalization of the bank. They have also conceded that the finding of the

trial Court regarding double jeopardize is imaginary and no case for double

jeopardize is made out. However, it is contended that the case relates to the

period prior to the nationalization of the bank i.e. more than 30 years and as

such lenient view may be taken regarding quantum of sentence.

</p><p id="p_17">17.          It is further contended that in Criminal Appeals No.542, 550

and 579- SB of 1995, the sentence of the accused has been reduced to the

period already undergone by increasing the sentence of fine. So, it is

contended that the judgments may be passed accordingly.

</p><p id="p_18">18.         I have considered the submission made by both the sides and
have gone through the records.
</p>
<p id="p_19">19.         Learned counsel for both the parties are fair enough to concede

that the evidence against the present accused is similar to that of evidence in

earlier appeals, in which conviction of the present respondents-accused

have been upheld and which relates to the period after nationalization of the

bank. So, after considering the submissions made by both the parties and I

have no hesitation in holding that the trial Court has acquitted the accused

on flimsy grounds on the same set of allegations. The present accused have

been convicted and their conviction stood upheld as in criminal appeal

Nos.542, 550 and 579- SB of 1995. However, in these appeals Nos.542,

550 and 579- SB of 1995, this Court has taken a lenient view regarding

quantum of sentence.
</p>
<p id="p_20">20.         In the present case Nem Chand accused is reported to have

died. So, the appeal qua Nem Chand stands abated.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_6"> Criminal Appeal No.S-1638-SBA of 2002                                7</span><p id="p_21">




</p><p id="p_22">21.         Shri Arshwinder Singh Advocate appeared on behalf of M/s

P.S.Jain Motors through Ramesh Chander Jain son of Shri P.S.Jain, Parbash

Chand Jain son of P.S.Jain, and R.K,Jain son of R.C.Jain accused No.2(ii )

and 2(iii) Shri N.K.Jain Advocate appeared on behalf of respondent No.5

and 6 at one stage of the trial. These Advocates have not come present

during the course of arguments. So, I have myself examined the case of the

said accused and have gone through the records of the case.

</p><p id="p_23">22.          All the accused have entered into criminal conspiracy to take

advance of Rs.11,00,000/- by getting the loan in the name of various

unauthorized persons from M/s P.S.Jain Motors on the basis of forged

documents. The insurance agents have also prepared forged documents to

enable the bank to advance the money. So, all the respondents except Nem

Chand are held guilty under <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_23">Section 120-B</a>, <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_24">IPC</a> read with <a href="/doc/1436241/" id="a_25">Section 420</a> of

the IPC. N.C.Jain, Parbash Chand Jain and S.K.Jain stood as guarantor to

those fictitious loanees and forged the signatures of fictitious loanees

namely Subhash Chand, Raj Kumar Bansal, Rajinder Parshad, Bal Krishan,

Vijay Kumar and Abhay Ram. V.K.Chawla (PW-31) has proved various

documents prepared during the course of granting of loan to these fictitious

persons. N.C.Jain, S.K.Jain and P.C.Jain have forged these signatures. So,

these accused   are held guilty under <a href="/doc/556166/" id="a_26">Section 468</a> IPC along with Avinash

Chander and Padam Sen Jain. However, regarding quantum of sentence,

this Court has to keep into consideration that matter relates to more than 30

years back. Moreover, this Court in Criminal Appeal Nos.542, 550 and 579-

SB of 1995 has sentenced the accused by way of fine to the extent of 1/4th
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7"> Criminal Appeal No.S-1638-SBA of 2002                                    8</span>




of the amount, which was embezzled by the accused.
</p>
<p id="p_24">23.           Counsel for the CBI is fair enough to concede that loan amount

has been deposited.
</p>

</pre><p id="p_28">has submitted that against an amount of Rs.11 crores, 20 lacs the appellants

have already paid a sum of Rs.14 crores. 50 lacs. However, well reasoned

judgment passed by the learned trial Court based upon documentary

evidence has not been seriously challenged. Thus, this Court has no reason

to interfere in the judgment of conviction passed by the learned trial Court

and as such, the same is hereby maintained.
</p>
<p id="p_29">As against the sentence, learned counsel for the appellants

has argued that this case relates to the year 1984. The appellants have

faced protracted trial for over 25 years and now the appellants are quite old.

It is also submitted by Mr.Ghai that Prabhash Chand Jain is more than 67

years, Manjit Singh Sandhu 64 years and Raj Kumar Jain is of 58 years.

Learned counsel for the appellants has relied upon a decision of this Court

passed in Crl.Appeal No.962-SB of 1997 titled as Prabash Chand Jain Vs.

State of Punjab and another, to contend that in the said case, some of the

present appellants were tried in RC No.14 of 1985 under the same

provisions of <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_27">IPC</a> and the Prevention of corruption Act, by the learned

Special Judge, C.B.I, Patiala and the appellants were sentenced for a

maximum period of two years and all the substantive sentences of

imprisonment were ordered to run concurrently. The said order of

conviction and sentence dated 17.11.1997 has been maintained by this

Court as the total loss suffered by the bank was Rs. 3,60,000/-. It is

submitted that in the said case, sentence of imprisonment was reduced to

one already undergone, however, the sentence of fine was enhanced to

Rs.70,000/- which was ordered to be equally shared by the appellants.

On a pointed question put to Mr. Ajay Kaushik, learned



counsel appearing for the C.B.I as to whether the order passed in Crl.Appeal

No.962-SB of 1997 has been challenged by the prosecution before the

Apex Court, the learned counsel very fairly conceded that said order has

not been challenged.
</p>
<p id="p_30">After hearing the learned counsel for the parties and taking

into consideration the fact that the appellants have become old and have

suffered protracted trial of 25 years as the charge sheet is of the year 1984

and also the fact that the appellants have already deposited the amount of

the bank, the order of sentence of imprisonment is ordered to be reduced to

one already undergone by them. However, since the amount involved in

this case is Rs.20 lacs, therefore, the fine is enhanced to Rs. 4 lacs which

shall be equally shared by the appellants. The impugned order of sentence

thus stands modified to the extent indicated herein-above.

The amount of fine shall be deposited by the appellants in

the trial Court within a period of two months from the date of receipt of a

copy of this order. If any of the appellants fails to deposit his share of the

fine amount before the trial Court within the period stipulated above, his

appeal shall be deemed to have been dismissed. The Registry of this Court

is directed to send the records of these appeals along-with this judgment

immediately to the trial Court, and the trial Court, on receipt of the same,

will try to convey to the appellants the result of their appeals decided by this

Court in the best possible way i.e. either through the counsel for the

appellants in the trial Court or through the Process Serving Agency at the

District Headquarters, so as to ensure that the appellants know the result of

their appeals and deposit the fine amount.
