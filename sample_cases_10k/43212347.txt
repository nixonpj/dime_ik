           IN THE HIGH COURT OF PUNJAB AND HARYANA                   I attest to the accuracy and integrity
                                                                     of this document

                                        vs

The State of Haryana and others                            .. Respondents


Coram:       Hon'ble Mr. Justice Rajesh Bindal

Present:     None for the petitioner.
             Mr. Harish Rathee, Senior Deputy Advocate General, Haryana.


Rajesh Bindal, J.
</pre><p id="p_1">             The petitioner approached this Court with a prayer that after
setting aside of his dismissal order, he was entitled to all consequential
benefits.
</p><p id="p_2">             Reply of the State is not on record. A copy furnished by learned
counsel for the State in Court, is taken on record. Learned counsel for the
State submitted that it has been stated in para 4-A of the reply that the
period of absence was treated to be on duty for all intents and purposes and
accordingly the arrears of salary were paid to the petitioner as per rules. In
para 11 thereof, it is stated that the petitioner having not qualified the Lower
School Course to bring his name on promotion List C-1 as per Rules 13.7 of
the Punjab Police Rules Volume II, he could not be granted the promotion.
Otherwise also, he was not eligible to attend the Lower School Course as
even on the date of his dismissal from service in the year 1979, he was over
age. The petitioner was considered and promoted as Head Constable (UGC)
in August, 1992. As per the Rules, he did not have any right for further
promotion.
</p><p id="p_3">             Considering the aforesaid stand in the reply, prima facie, there
is no merit in the present petition, however, as none appeared for the
petitioner, the writ petition is dismissed for non-prosecution.
</p>
