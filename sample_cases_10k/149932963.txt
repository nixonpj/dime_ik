      <div class="docsource_main">Madhya Pradesh High Court</div>
<div class="doc_title">Siddhgopal Verma vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 24 November, 2014</div><pre id="pre_1">                Criminal Revision No. 2007/2014
               Siddhgopal Verma Vs. The State of M.P.
24.11.2014</pre>
<p id="p_1">      Shri Siddharth Datt, Advocate for the applicant.
      Smt. Anjali Gyanani, Panel Lawyer for the State.
      Heard finally with the consent of the learned counsel for
the parties.
</p><p id="p_2">      This revision has been filed by the applicant under <a href="/doc/1457888/" id="a_1">Section
397</a>/<a href="/doc/1571667/" id="a_2">401</a> of the Cr.P.C. being aggrieved by order dated 27.8.2014
passed by Second Additional Sessions Judge, Umariya, in S.T.
No. 6/2014 by which the charge under <a href="/doc/92983/" id="a_3">Section 306</a> of the IPC
has been framed against the applicant.
</p><p id="p_3">      The facts, in short, giving rise to this revision are that on
18.6.2013 Badri Prasad Burman had committed suicide by
hanging himself. It is alleged against the applicant that he, in the
capacity of CEO of Janpad Panchayat, Manpur, District Umariya,
along with other co-accused persons did not pay the labour
charges to Badri Prasad Burman and when he went to take
labour charges of Kapildhara scheme, the applicant and co-
accused persons refused to pay the aforesaid charges, therefore,
Badri Prasad Burman committed suicide. The report was lodged
by his brother.
</p><p id="p_4">      After usual investigation, the applicant and other co-
accused persons have been charge sheeted before JMFC, who
committed the case to Additional Sessions Judge. Learned
Additional Sessions Judge framed the charges under <a href="/doc/92983/" id="a_4">section 306</a>
of the IPC against the applicant and other co-accused persons,
hence this revision on behalf of the applicant.
</p><p id="p_5">      Learned counsel for the applicant has submitted that the
trial Court has committed illegality in framing the charge under
<a href="/doc/92983/" id="a_5">Section 306</a> of the IPC against the applicant. As per prosecution,
 there is no prima facie evidence on record against the applicant
to show that the applicant had instigated the deceased or due to
his acts or illegal omission,   Badri Prasad Burman committed
suicide, therefore, no prima facie evidence has been collected by
the prosecution under <a href="/doc/1667403/" id="a_6">Section 107</a> of the IPC. As per the post
mortem report, the deceased had the history of mental illness
and he was treated by a Psychologist at Jabalpur, which shows
that the applicant might have committed suicide in depressed
state of mind, therefore, no case under <a href="/doc/92983/" id="a_7">Section 306</a> of the IPC is
made out against the applicant. Counsel has placed reliance on a
decision of the Apex Court in Gangula Mohan Reddy Vs. State
of Andhra Pradesh - AIR 2010 SC 327.
</p><p id="p_6">      Learned counsel for the State has supported the order
passed by the trial Court.
</p><p id="p_7">      I have perused the case diary along with the post mortem
report of the deceased. It reveals that the applicant was not the
person, who was authorized to make payment of the labour
charges. No ingredient of <a href="/doc/1667403/" id="a_8">Section 107</a> of the IPC has been found
against the applicant. As per the post mortem report, the
deceased had history of mental illness and he had obtained
treatment from a Psychologist, which shows that at the time of
committing suicide, he might be under depressed state of mind.
</p><p id="p_8">      The Apex Court in Gangula Mohan Reddy Vs. State of
Andhra Pradesh - AIR 2010 SC 327 observed that the
deceased was undoubtedly hypersensitive to ordinary petulance,
discord and differences which happen in our day-to-day life.
Human sensitivity of each individual differs from the other.
Different people behave differently in the same situation. Apex
Court further observed that abetment involves a mental process
of instigating a person or intentionally aiding a person in doing
of a thing. Without a positive act on the part of the accused to
 instigate or aid in committing suicide, conviction cannot be
sustained.
</p><p id="p_9">      In the light of the aforesaid decision of the Apex Court and
in the facts and circumstances of the case, in my opinion, the
trial Court has committed illegality in framing the charge under
<a href="/doc/92983/" id="a_9">Section 306</a> of the IPC against the applicant.
</p><p id="p_10">      Consequently, the revision is allowed. Impugned order
dated 27.8.2014, so far as it relates to the applicant, is hereby
set aside. The applicant is acquitted to the charge under <a href="/doc/92983/" id="a_10">Section
306</a> of the IPC.
</p><p id="p_11">      Let a copy of this order be sent to the trial Court for
compliance and necessary action.
</p><p id="p_12">      Certified copy as per rules.
</p>

<p id="p_13">                                       (G.S.Solanki)
