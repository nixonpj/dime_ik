ORDER
</pre>

<p id="p_1">1.        By this order, I shall dispose off the application moved by the

petitioner under section 33 C (2) of <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_1">Industrial Disputes Act</a>, 1947.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                   2</span>




</p><p id="p_2">2.       It is alleged by the applicant that she was employed as a

'Telly - Caller' by the management No.1 on monthly wages of

Rs.6000/- per month w.e.f. 03.02.05. That the claimant performed

her duties continuously with the management to their satisfaction.



</p><p id="p_3">3.       It is further alleged that the management No.2 and the

management No.1 are sister concerns. That the management did not

pay wages from 03.02.05 up to the date of termination to the

workman amounting to Rs.23571.43. That the overtime amounting to

Rs.17501.20 has also not been paid.
</p>
<p id="p_4">

</p><p id="p_5">4.       That the management only paid, by cheque, an amount of

Rs.1898/- to the claimant/workman. It is, therefore, prayed that the

management be directed to pay the balance sum of Rs.39174.63 to

the claimant as this amount is legally payable by the management to

the claimant as a part of her earned wages. The claimant has also

sought interest @18% per annum on the aforesaid amount.



</p><p id="p_6">5.       The respondent did not appear despite service and was
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                   3</span>

proceeded ex parte.
</p>
<p id="p_7">

</p><p id="p_8">6.        The claimant has examined herself and has also examined

one more witness in support of her claim and contentions.



6A.       I have carefully gone through the entire relevant material

appearing on record and have given my considered thought to the

arguments that have been advanced, on behalf of the workman.



</p><p id="p_9">7.        The claimant has proved her identity card, copy of which is

Ex.WW1/1, to show the relationship between the parties. It is further

deposed by the claimant that both the managements are sister

concern of each other and are liable to answer the claim, preferred in

this case, by the claimant.
</p>
<p id="p_10">

</p><p id="p_11">8.        The claimant has further alleged that she was paid only one

cheque amounting to Rs.1898/-. Copy of the said cheque has been

proved as Ex.WW1/2. She has also proved the documents exhibited

as Ex.WW1/3 &amp; Ex.WW1/4 and has substantiated, the contentions

raised by her, in her petition.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                    4</span><p id="p_12">




</p><p id="p_13">9.       The claimant has also claimed the interest @18% per

annum.     WW-2 has proved that the cheque, copy of which is

Ex.WW1/2 was duly credited in the account of the petitioner.     This

witness has proved the documents exhibited as Ex.WW2/1 and

Ex.WW2/3.
</p>
<p id="p_14">

</p><p id="p_15">10.      There is no evidence on the part of the management to

counter or contradict the evidence led by the petitioner. Under these

circumstances, the petitioner/workman has proved her contentions.



</p><p id="p_16">11.      An award in the sum of Rs.39174.63 is passed in favour of

the petitioner and against the management.        The management is

further directed to pay the interest on the aforesaid amount @8% per

annum, from the date of petition till the realization of the aforesaid

decreed amount.    The interest @18% per annum demanded by the

petitioner, to my mind, is excessive and, therefore, I have granted

interest @ 8% per annum which appears to be just and reasonable. In

the aforesaid terms, the application stands allowed.
