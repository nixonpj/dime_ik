                     HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE RAKESH KUMAR
                     And
                     HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE ASHWANI KUMAR SINGH

          C.A.V. JUDGMENT
          (Per: HONOURABLE THE CHIEF JUSTICE)

          Date: 25 -11-2014


                         This group of writ petitions and the Letters Patent
         Appeal have landed before the Full Bench pursuant to the
         reference made by the learned single Judge under order dated 21st
         July 2009.
</p><p id="p_156">                         The matter at issue is the legality of the appointment
         of each petitioner in Class III service in Intensive Artificial
         Insemination Programme made by the Regional Director in Animal
         Husbandry Department of the State of Bihar.
</p><p id="p_157">                         According to the State Government, concerned posts
         were of State Cadre; the Regional Director of Animal Husbandry
         did not have power or authority to make appointment; the
         appointment of the writ petitioners was made without the authority
         of law; was illegal and void ab initio. In the above view of the
         State Government, the State Government issued direction to the
         Regional Directors of Animal Husbandry to take steps to terminate
         the service of each such employee. It is the said direction issued by
         the State Government and the consequent action of termination of
         service taken by the Regional Director of Animal Husbandry
         which are the subject matter of challenge in each writ petition.
</p><p id="p_158">                         The learned single Judge has, under the reference

         dated 21st July 2009, traced the history of the appointment and
         termination of service of the writ petitioners. The learned single
         Judge has noted that there were diverse opinion of several benches
         of this Court. A Division Bench of this Court had, under order
         dated 11th October 1993 made in CWJC No.7162 of 1993, upheld
         the action of the State Government. However, that view was
         questioned by another bench under its order dated 29th August
         2008 made pending CWJC No.4402 of 2000. The learned single
         Judge has also noted various orders made by the Benches of the
         learned single Judge in several writ petitions; the orders of the
         Division Bench dated 26th November 1999, 6th December 1999 and
         25th January 2005 which upheld the action of the State Government
         and also the judgment of the Hon‟ble Supreme Court in the matter
         of <a href="/doc/591273/" id="a_1">State of Bihar vs. Upendra Narayan Singh &amp; others</a> [(2009) 5 SCC 65].
         The learned single Judge also noted that while making the
         aforesaid order dated 29th August 2008 the Bench had not noticed
         the above referred Division Bench judgments dated 26th November
         1999; 6th December 1999; and 25th January 2005. Nevertheless, the
         learned single Judge instead of following the binding precedent in
         the matter of Upendra Narayan Singh (supra) preferred to refer the
         matter to the Full Bench.
</p><p id="p_159">                         We have heard the learned advocates appearing for
         the writ petitioners. More or less the facts are common. Each writ
         petitioner was initially appointed as casual worker in Intensive
         Artificial Insemination Programme under the Regional Director,
         Animal Husbandry, Patna Barauni/ Darbhanga in 1988/1989. After
         working as casual worker for around a year, under the orders made
         by      the      Regional        Director      of   Animal   Husbandry,
         Patna/Barauni/Darbhanga each writ petitioner was "in view of his
         long service for years" appointed as "Progressive Assistant" or
 Patna High Court CWJC No.12904 of 1996 dt. 25-11-2014

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">                                        15/19</span>




         "Computer/ Enumerator" in Class III service in 1989/1990. The
         series of such appointments made by the Regional Directors came
         to the notice of the State Government. The State Government,
         therefore, in 1997 directed the Regional Directors, Animal
         Husbandry to examine all such appointments and to take steps to
         cancel the illegal appointments. Pursuant to the said direction, after
         giving opportunity to each petitioner to show cause, their service
         has been terminated under the respective orders.
</p><p id="p_160">                         According to the learned advocates appearing for the
         writ petitioners, the action taken by the State Government and the
         consequential orders made by the Regional Director of Animal
         Husbandry are not justified.
</p><p id="p_161">                         The first submission is that the Regional Director of
         Animal Husbandry was authorized to make appointments. As held
         by this Court under order dated 25th September 1999 made in
         CWJC No.10785 of 1997, the Regional Director enjoyed the said
         authority until 28th October 1991. Each appointment in question
         was made by the concerned Regional Director in 1989/1990 in
         exercise of the power conferred upon him. The very basis that the
         Regional Director had no authority is erroneous. Each petitioner
         was validly appointed on a sanctioned vacant post by the
         competent authority.
</p><p id="p_162">                         The second submission is that even if the appointment
         of the writ petitioners/appellant were not legal and regular, the
         order of termination of their service made without holding enquiry
         envisaged by <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_2">Article 311 (2)</a> of the Constitution was not
         sustainable.
</p><p id="p_163">                         The third limb of the submission is that in any view of
         the matter the appointment of the writ petitioners was made on
         sanctioned vacant posts. All the petitioners having rendered about

         10 years‟ service, their service was liable to be regularised as held
         by the Hon‟ble Supreme Court in the matters of State of Karnataka
         &amp; Ors. Vs. Uma Devi (3) [(2006) 4 SCC 1] and of State of Karnatka &amp;
         Ors. Vs. M.L. Keshari [(2010) 9 SCC 247].
</p><p id="p_164">                         The      reliance      is   also   placed   on   Government
         Communications dated 17th February 1962 and dated 30th April
         1966 issued by the Deputy Secretary to the Government addressed
         to the Accountant General. Under the said Communications, the
         Accountant General had been informed that the State Government
         had delegated, inter alia, the power of appointment of Class III
         ministerial staff to the Range and Sectional Officers of the Animal
         Husbandry Department and the administrative and financial
         powers to the Special Officer, Patna and Barauni and Artificial
         Insemination Officer and Veterinary Officer as per the attachment
         under communication dated 30th April 1966. On perusal of the said
         attachment it is apparent that the administrative powers, such as
         purchase, repairs, production of cattle feed, medicines were
         delegated to the officers at various level. The Special Officer,
         Patna and Barauni were, inter alia, delegated full power of
         appointment of Class III ministerial staff and Class IV staff.
</p><p id="p_165">                         According to the State Government, the said
         delegation was no longer in operation. On 20th April 1981, the
         Personnel and Administrative Reforms Department had, in
         supersession of all earlier directions, issued general direction for
         appointment to various State Cadre posts. The Class III posts under
         the Regional Director were the State Cadre posts. Consequent upon
         the instructions issued on 20th April 1981 the power to make
         appointment on such posts were vested in the State. For the
         purpose of selection, the State Government had established the
         Bihar State Subordinate Service Selection Board. In other words,
 Patna High Court CWJC No.12904 of 1996 dt. 25-11-2014

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">                                        17/19</span>




         the power to make selection was exclusively vested in the Bihar
         State Subordinate Service Selection Board and the authority to
         make appointment was vested in the State Government.
         Admittedly, each writ petitioner was appointed after 20th April
         1981. None of the writ petitioners was appointed after going
         through due selection procedure. Not one appointment was legal
         and valid.
</p><p id="p_166">                         These are the basic facts and contentions raised before
         us. We need not delve into the matter further since the matter has
         already been set at rest by the Hon‟ble Supreme Court in the matter
         of State of Bihar Vs. Upendra Narayan Singh [(2009) 5 SCC 65]. In the
         said matter an identical issue was raised in respect of the
         appointment of the respondent Upendra Narain Singh made by the
         Regional Director of Animal Husbandry. The Hon‟ble Judges have
         discussed the right to equality enshrined under Articles 14 and 16
         of the Constitution. The learned Judges of the Hon‟ble Supreme
         Court have relied upon "Framing of India's Constitution Volume
         II, edited by B. Shiva Rao" and the parliamentary discussions. The
         Hon‟ble Court has held, "The basic principle which, therefore, informs
         both Articles 14 and 16 is equality and inhibition against discrimination".
</p>
<p id="p_167">         After extensive discussion on the basic principle and plethora of
         judgments on the issue, the Hon‟ble Court has upheld the action of
         the State Government. The Hon‟ble Court dismissed the arguments
         based on right to life protected under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_3">Article 21</a> of the
         Constitution.
</p><p id="p_168">                         In view of the aforesaid judgment of the Hon‟ble
         Supreme Court, the binding precedent, I have but to uphold the
         action of the State Government.
</p><p id="p_169">                         Let me assume for a moment that the Regional
         Director of Animal Husbandry was empowered to make
 Patna High Court CWJC No.12904 of 1996 dt. 25-11-2014

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">                                        18/19</span>




         appointment of Class III ministerial staff and Class IV staff under
         him. Even in that case, was the Regional Director justified in
         making the appointments in the manner in which he made the
         appointments. The power has to be exercised in the manner in
         which it is directed to be exercised. Even under 1966 delegation of
         power, the Regional Director was not empowered to make
         appointments indiscriminately, at his will or without following due
         process of selection.
</p><p id="p_170">                         In the present case, each petitioner was initially
         appointed as a casual worker. After serving for a year or so, each
         writ petitioner was regularised in Class III service on the pretext
         that each petitioner had rendered „long service‟. Evidently, the
         appointment of the petitioners was made contrary to all canons of
         service jurisprudence. Admittedly, the Regional Director had not
         invited applications by public notice. None of the petitioners had to
         face competition. They were offered the employment on a platter
         without following due process of law. The appointment of the writ
         petitioners was ex facie bad and illegal and untenable. The
         judgments of the Hon‟ble Supreme court in the matter of Uma
         Devi (supra) or M. L. Keshri (supra) cannot be pressed into
         service to regularise totally illegal service of the writ petitioners.
         Time and again the Hon‟ble Supreme Court has deprecated the
         illegal appointments made in the State service by adopting dubious
         measures and the act of regularization of such dubious
         appointments.
</p><p id="p_171">                         In my view, the appointment of the writ petitioners
         was totally illegal and arbitrary, the least that the State Government
         could do is to get rid of such employees appointed on extraneous
         consideration in utter disregard of the principle of equality
         enshrined in Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution.

                                   For the aforesaid reasons, the writ petitions and the
                   appeal are dismissed.
