HON'BLE THE ACTING CHIEF JUSTICE
HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE RAJIV SAHAI ENDLAW
                                    JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">RAJIV SAHAI ENDLAW, J.
</p>
<p id="p_2">1.     The writ petition, filed in public interest, seeking directions for
enforcement of Delhi Apartment Ownership Act, 1986, was disposed of
vide judgment dated 28th May, 2010; various infirmities/deficiencies/
loopholes in the Act and the limitations of the court in issuing any directions
for amendment or replacement of the Act noticed; however an attempt was
still made to make the Act workable by giving certain directions for (i)
appointment of Competent Authority under the Act; (ii) registration of
deeds of apartment and, (iii) formation of Apartment Owners Association.
The matter was kept pending to ensure compliance.
</p><p id="p_3">2.     Though more than two years have since passed and status reports as
to implementation of the directions issued have been filed by various
agencies from time to time but unfortunately the benefits of the Act have till
now not percolated to the apartment owners. Besides the petitioner, several
other persons have been appearing before us making grievance in this
regard. They state that the Deeds of Apartment are not being executed and
registered as yet and owing whereto they are unable to beneficially hold,
use, enjoy, transfer, mortgage the apartments, the full consideration whereof
has been paid by them and for which reason they remain in the clutches of
the promoter/builder of the multi-storied buildings containing the
apartments.
</p>

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">W.P.(C) Nos.1959/2007 &amp; 8705/2011                                  Page 2 of 8</span>
<p id="p_4"> 3.     The L&amp;DO and DDA, in their status reports have informed of the
appointment by them respectively of Competent Authority under the Act.
They however inform that the delay in execution of the Deeds of Apartment
is owing to the promoter/builder of the apartments not supplying to them,
inspite of requests, the information necessary for drawing up the said deeds.
The petitioner and other affected persons rejoin by contending that no
cooperation can be expected from the promoter/builder who would not be
interested in execution of the Deeds of Apartment and which would take
away the promoter's/builder's control over the apartments. Their further
grievance is that the Competent Authorities appointed are far too few and
which has resulted in the appropriate steps being not taken against the
promoter/builder of the apartments.
</p><p id="p_5">4.     As far as appointment of Competent Authority under the Act is
concerned, though Section 3(m) of the Act constitutes a Secretary in the
Delhi Administration or the Vice Chairman of the DDA or the Land &amp;
Development Officer of the Central Government, who may be authorized by
the Administrator by Notification in the Official Gazette, as the Competent
Authority under the Act but this court vide order dated 28 th May, 2010 supra
directed area/building wise appointment of Competent Authority, to enable
effective discharge of functions under the Act; it was further directed that
the Competent Authority may further authorize as many officers of the rank
of Dy. Commissioner or Joint Commissioner as may be necessary for
discharge of functions.
</p><p id="p_6">5.     The Act empowers the Competent Authority to:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">       (i)    extend the time prescribed under Section 13 of the Act for
              execution of Deed of Apartment [(See Proviso to Section

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">W.P.(C) Nos.1959/2007 &amp; 8705/2011                                Page 3 of 8</span>
                13(1)];
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">       (ii)    keep and maintain a record of Deeds of Appartment filed with
               it [See Section 13(2)];
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">       (iii)   record successions in title to apartment and to decide disputes
               if any as to succession [See Sections 13(4) &amp; 14(3)]; and,
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">       (iv)    send to the Registrar concerned for registration such changes in
               succession [See Section 13(5)].
</blockquote><p id="p_7">6.     The responsibility, under Section 13(1) of the Act, of execution of
Deed of Apartment is of the promoter. Promoter is defined in Section 3 (w)
of the Act inter alia as the person by whom the multi-storied building
containing the apartments has been constructed. The Deeds of Apartment
are registrable, under Section 14(1) of the Act, under the <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_1">Registration Act</a>,
1908 i.e. with the Registrar of Assurances and as aforesaid, only a copy
thereof is to be filed with the Competent Authority under the Act. <a href="/doc/46343/" id="a_2">Section
13(6)</a> further clarifies that the provisions therein of execution of Deed of
Apartment are in addition to and not in derogation of any other law in force
relating to transfer of immovable property. Thus the provisions of the
<a href="/doc/515323/" id="a_3">Transfer of Property Act</a>, <a href="/doc/171398/" id="a_4">Contract Act</a> and <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_5">Registration Act</a> etc. apply to
transfer of apartments also.
</p><p id="p_8">7.     This Court, vide order dated 28.05.2010 has directed the promoter/
builder to execute the Deeds of Apartment in the proforma as may be
approved by the Competent Authority, keeping in view the provisions of
<a href="/doc/1805463/" id="a_6">Section 13(1)</a> of the Act.           It was further directed that where the land
underneath the multi-storied building is leasehold, the L&amp;DO on behalf of
President of India shall also join as confirming party in the execution of the
Deeds of Apartment. The Competent Authority was further directed to give

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">W.P.(C) Nos.1959/2007 &amp; 8705/2011                                   Page 4 of 8</span>
 notice to the promoters / builders directing them to execute the Deeds of
Apartment.     Failure to comply with such directions was directed to be
treated as evasion of necessary stamp duty and registration charges inviting
imposition of penalty and action for recovery thereof. It was yet further
directed that upon the failure of the promoters / builders to execute and
register the Deed of Apartment, the buyer be treated as the owner of the
apartment for the purpose of getting the benefits under the Act.
</p><p id="p_9">8.     Learned Additional Solicitor General appearing for the L&amp;DO has
stated that though the Competent Authorities so appointed have repeatedly
called upon the promoters / builders including by insertion of public notices
in the newspapers, to furnish the details of their own title to the land,
description and measurements thereof including the built up areas, common
areas and the building plans, sale / transfer consideration etc. but no
response is being received. It is further stated that L&amp;DO has substantial
claims under the leases of the land underneath the multi-storied buildings
and L&amp;DO cannot be forced to transfer title in the apartments in favour of
the persons claiming the same without payment of the said dues. It is further
stated that under the Policy for freehold conversion of leasehold rights,
L&amp;DO is willing to grant freehold rights in the apartments in favour of the
apartment owners willing to pay the conversion charges. It is yet further
stated that in the absence of promoters / builders, it cannot be known as to
whom apartment was allotted / transferred.
</p><p id="p_10">9.     As far as the contents of the Deed of Apartment are concerned, the
Delhi Apartment Ownership Rules, 1987 provide the form of a Deed of
Apartment. A perusal thereof shows that the particulars required to be filled
therein, though available with the promoters/builders, would also be

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">W.P.(C) Nos.1959/2007 &amp; 8705/2011                                  Page 5 of 8</span>
 available with the apartment buyers and/or with the municipal agencies
which have sanctioned the construction. The said particulars inter alia
comprise     of   the   title   of   holder   of   the   land   underneath    the
buildings/apartments, the ground area, the total built up area, the number of
floors, the number of apartments and sizes thereof. The said particulars are
likely to be found in the documents of allotment of apartment and transfer of
possession of the apartment and can also be verified from the records of the
municipal agencies and of DDA/L&amp;DO who have granted leases of the land
underneath. Even if the building plans with the municipal agencies do not
show the sizes of the apartments, the Competent Authority can have the
same drawn up.
</p><p id="p_11">10.    Though the Deed of Apartment by the promoter / builder in favour of
the first allottee of the apartment as well as endorsement of subsequent
transfers of the apartment are to be registered with the Registrar under the
<a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_7">Registration Act</a> as aforesaid and the remedy under the prevalent laws of a
purchaser of immovable property, as an apartment is, even if in possession,
against the seller for non-execution of the Sale Deed is to sue for specific
performance but this Court has already vide order dated 28.05.2010 directed
that inaction / failure of the promoters / builders in executing and registering
the Deed of Apartment would entitle the owner of the apartment to get all
the benefits of the Act. However, the question whether the promoter /
builder has failed to so execute and register the Deed of Apartment is also to
be adjudicated either in a suit for specific performance or in an arbitration, if
provided for in the allotment / possession letter of the apartment. The
Competent Authority, as aforesaid, under <a href="/doc/46343/" id="a_8">Section 13(4)</a> supra has been
empowered to decide the disputes as to succession to the apartment. We are

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">W.P.(C) Nos.1959/2007 &amp; 8705/2011                                   Page 6 of 8</span>
 of the opinion that the dispute whether the promoter / builder has failed in
executing and registering the Deed of Apartment would be within the scope
of <a href="/doc/46343/" id="a_9">Section 13(4)</a> of the Act and the Competent Authority would be entitled
to pass an order directing the promoter / builder to execute the Deed of
Apartment and if the Promoter / Builder inspite thereof does not execute the
Deed of Apartment, to itself execute and register the Deed of Apartment on
behalf of the promoter / builder. Similarly, the disputes if any, as to who, at
present is entitled to the apartment, are also to be decided by the Competent
Authority.
</p><p id="p_12">11.    We thus direct that in the event of the apartment owners applying to
the Competent Authority, the Competent Authority shall, after granting
opportunity of hearing to the promoters / builders and after satisfying itself
as to the transfer of apartment to the promoters /builders and possession
thereof, pass such orders directing promoters / builders to execute and
register the Deed and if the promoters / builders still defaults, execute and
register the Deed itself.
</p><p id="p_13">12.    As far as the claims aforesaid of the land owning agencies as DDA
and L&amp;DO are concerned, they cannot seek to recover the entire amount
due with respect to the land, only from the apartment owners who approach
them for so joining in the Deeds of Apartment. The said claims have to be
spread out pro-rata i.e. proportional to the size of the apartment, on each of
the apartments. We thus direct that upon any of the apartment owners so
approaching the DDA or L&amp;DO, DDA or L&amp;DO as the case may be to
within three months intimate pro-rata demand against that particular
apartment and upon payment thereof join the promoter / builder or the
Competent Authority as the case may be in executing the Deeds of

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">W.P.(C) Nos.1959/2007 &amp; 8705/2011                                  Page 7 of 8</span>
 Apartment. However, if the said claims are disputed by the apartment
owners, we are afraid the same cannot be adjudicated neither in these
proceedings nor by the Competent Authority and appropriate remedy
thereagainst will have to be taken. All that can be observed is that DDA /
L&amp;DO ought to take a reasonable stand and explore the possibility of
granting rebates etc. as in fact also provided in <a href="/doc/1033713/" id="a_10">Section 25</a> of the Act. We
may also mention that the land owning agency shall be entitled to collect the
freehold conversion charges only from such of the apartment buyers as are
interested in having their share in the leasehold rights in the land underneath
so converted and shall not be entitled to impose the same on others whose
share in the land underneath shall remain on leasehold basis and subject to
the terms of the lease.
</p><p id="p_14">13.    Else, we are assured that the registering authorities have been directed
to register the Deeds of Apartment.
</p><p id="p_15">14.    The petitioner has also sought a direction for waiver of stamp duty.
Though the Central Government under <a href="/doc/1033713/" id="a_11">Section 25</a> of the Act has been
empowered to grant such exemption but it is beyond the powers of this
Court. No such direction can thus be issued by us.
</p><p id="p_16">15.    With the aforesaid directions, need is not felt to keep these petitions
pending and the same are disposed of.
</p>
