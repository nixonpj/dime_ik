UNDER    SECTION 173(1) OF THE MOTOR VEHICLES ACT,
PRAYING TO ALLOW THE ABOVE APPEAL BY SETTING
ASIDE THE JUDGMENT AND AWARD DATED 14.11.2016 IN
M.V.C.NO.765/2013, PASSED BY THE PRL. SENIOR CIVIL
JUDGE &amp; MACT, KALABURAGI.
                                    3


        This    appeal     is    coming   for   order   this   day,
N.K.SUDHINDRARAO J, delivered the following:


                                JUDGMENT
</pre>

<p id="p_1">        With the consent of learned counsel on both sides,

the matter is taken up for final disposal.


</p><p id="p_2">        2.     MFA No.200300/2017 is directed against the

judgment and award passed by the learned Prl. Senior Civil

Judge and MACT at Kalaburagi, in MVC No.765/2013

challenging the quantum of compensation awarded by the

Tribunal and the liability being fastened on the appellant-

Insurance Company.
</p>
<p id="p_3">
</p><p id="p_4">        3.     In order to avoid confusion and overlapping,

the parties hereinafter are referred in accordance with

their respective rankings before the Tribunal.


</p><p id="p_5">        4.     The claimants are the mother and father and

grand        mother   of    the    deceased     -   Abhishek   S/o
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                4</span>


Harishchandra Bharath, who met with an accident on

27.08.2013 at about 15.00 hours near Kudaremukha

Hodda. The deceased Abhishek was travelling in a Hundayi

Eon Car bearing Reg.No.AP-29-AX-2199 along with his

relatives   from   Hyderabad   to   Bijapur   via   Humnabad

National Highway.
</p>
<p id="p_6">
</p><p id="p_7">      5.     One Siddharth was driving the said car and the

deceased Abhishek was sitting on the backside of the said

car. The car was being driven at high speed and in a rash

and negligent manner without following the traffic rules,

endangering to human life by overtaking the vehicles in

spite of it, driver was being instructed to drive slowly. But

at that time, the driver suddenly turned the car at the right

side of the road and applied the brake due to which the car

tilted and accident occurred. Due to which, all the persons

including   Abhishek    sustained    severe     injuries   and

succumbed on the spot. The claim petition came to be

preferred under <a href="/doc/136948773/" id="a_1">Section 166</a> of the Motor Vehicles Act
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                    5</span>


claiming compensation of Rs.31,50,000/- by Smt. Renuka,

mother of deceased Abhishek, Sri.Harishchandra, father of

Abhishek and Smt.Parvathamma, grand mother.


</p><p id="p_8">      6.       The second respondent is said to be the insurer

of the offending vehicle.              The learned Member after

considering the material regarding the accident, injury,

disability   and     entitlement    of    compensation,   awarded

compensation of Rs.17,15,760/- to the claimants together

with interest at 6% per annum from the date of petition till

the deposit.
</p>
<p id="p_9">
</p><p id="p_10">      7.       The deceased Abhishek was working in a

Private Company by name Panasonic India Pvt. Ltd., as a

Product Promoter and getting salary of Rs.20,000/- per

month. The learned Member has taken the income of the

deceased at Rs.10,920/- per month and added 50% of the

monthly income of the deceased towards future prospects

and   the    total    income   of       the   deceased   comes   to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                 6</span>


Rs.16,380/- per month (Rs.10,920/- + Rs.5,460/-). The

Tribunal has considered the claimant Nos.1 and 2 as

dependents of deceased and 50% of the income has been

deducted towards personal and living expenses of the

deceased and taken the net income at Rs.8,190/- per

month.
</p>
<p id="p_11">
</p><p id="p_12">     8.     In this context the learned counsel for the

appellant would submit that the income of the deceased

taken by the Tribunal is on the higher side, as the

deceased was not earning such amount.


</p><p id="p_13">     9.     However, he has left his parents and it cannot

be ruled out that he cannot look after his parents.

Claimant No.3 is the grand mother of the deceased and

she was not dependent on the deceased. Therefore,

claimant No.3 is not entitled for any compensation.


</p><p id="p_14">     10.    In the circumstances of the case, the total

amount     granted   to   the   claimants   towards   loss   of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                7</span>


 dependency is *Rs.16,70,760/- (8,190x12x17) appears to

 be just and proper. In so far as the compensation granted

 on the other heads deserves to be maintained.


</p><p id="p_15">       11.   We have also noted that claimant No.3 is not

 dependent on the deceased and we do not find any

 infirmity or irregularity in the judgment and award passed

 by the Tribunal and the compensation awarded by the

 Tribunal is neither higher nor less. Hence, appeal does not

 deserve to be allowed. Hence, it is rejected.


</p><p id="p_16">       12.   The appellant is hereby directed to deposit the

 compensation amount as stated in the judgment and

 award passed by the Tribunal,** along with interest as

 awarded by the Tribunal.
</p>
<p id="p_17">
</p><p id="p_18">       13.   The appellant - Insurance Company shall

 deposit the remaining amount apart from the deposit

 within four weeks from the date of receipt of the certified

 copy of this judgment.
</p>
<p id="p_19">

** Inserted vide Court order dated: 04.10.2017.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                             8</span>


</p><p id="p_20">     14.   The amount in deposit is ordered to be

transmitted to the concerned Tribunal forthwith.
