               Dated this the 17th day of December, 2013

                           JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">S.Siri Jagan, J.
</p>
<p id="p_2">      The unfortunate minor children of Tessy, who died in a

motor vehicle accident, caused by the negligent driving of a

vehicle driven by the 1st respondent, owned by the 3rd

respondent and insured with the 2nd respondent are the

appellants herein. They filed OP(MV) No.1148/2001 before

the    Motor     Accidents     Claims     Tribunal,  Pala,  claiming

compensation for the death of their mother impleading their

father as the 4th respondent who was driving the vehicle in

which the deceased was travelling at the time of the accident.

The Tribunal, after finding the negligence on the part of the

driver of the vehicle, awarded compensation of .5,13,000/-

on various heads as follows:-
</p>
<pre id="pre_2"> Loss of dependency                   4,76,000/-

 Transport to Hospital                1500/-

 Damage to clothing                   500/-

 Funeral expenses                     5000/-

 Pain and suffering                   10,000/-

 Loss  of Consortium to     the   4th 10,000/-
 respondent

 Loss of love and affection           10,000/-

 Total                                5,13,000/-

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">MACA No. 741 of 2005             2</span>

</pre><p id="p_3">Dissatisfied with the quantum of compensation awarded by the

Tribunal, the appellants have filed this appeal before this court,

seeking enhanced compensation.
</p>
<p id="p_4">     2.     The accident was on 21-08-2000. The deceased was

32 years old at that time. According to the appellants, their

mother was a qualified lecturer and she was working in an

aided college prior to the accident. She had worked in various

leave vacancies in that college and was earning a monthly

salary of 7,873/-.     She had a realistic chance of getting a

permanent appointment in the next arising vacancy in view of

the right conferred on her by the University statutes on the

basis of the approved service in the leave vacancies. Despite

the same, the Tribunal fixed her monthly income only as 

3500/-, which is on the lower side is the first contention. It is

further submitted that as per the decision of Supreme Court in

<a href="/doc/108651051/" id="a_1">Rajesh V.Rajbir Singh</a> 2013(3) KLT 89 (SC), 50% should

have been added for future prospects, which the Tribunal has

not done. It is further submitted that the compensation for

loss of consortium awarded to the 4th respondent is on the

lower side. The appellants seek enhancement of compensation

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">MACA No. 741 of 2005             3</span>

for loss of love and affection also.     It is submitted by the

appellants that no amount has been awarded for loss of estate.

The appellants seek enhancement for funeral expenses as well.

</p><p id="p_5">     3.     We have heard the counsel for the insurance

company as well. The learned counsel would point out that the

multiplier to be adopted is 16 and not 17 as adopted by the

Tribunal. It is further submitted that the Tribunal assessed

compensation due in accordance with the correct parameters

and the appellants are not entitled to          enhancement of

compensation.
</p>
<p id="p_6">     4.     We have considered the rival contentions in detail.

</p><p id="p_7">     5.      Despite the fact that the appellants have examined

PW1, the Principal of Nirmala College, where the deceased had

worked, to prove that a permanent vacancy arose on 1.6.2004

and the deceased would have been appointed to the said post

had she been alive, since the appointment is to be approved by

the University and the Government, it cannot be held with any

amount of certainty that the income of the deceased would

have been that attached to a permanent post. As such, the

evidence adduced by the appellants are not sufficient to prove

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">MACA No. 741 of 2005            4</span>

that the deceased would have earned income as applicable to

a permanent lecturer. Still, we are of opinion that the monthly

income fixed by the Tribunal is on the lower side. Considering

the date of death and the living conditions as well as future

prospects, we take the income of the deceased adding future

prospects as 6000/- per month. But, as rightly pointed out by

the counsel for the insurance company, the multiplier to be

adopted is only 16 and not 17. Since there were only 2 minor

children and a husband of the deceased, the deduction for

personal expenses should be 1/3rd as per the decision in <a href="/doc/837924/" id="a_2">Sarla

Verma V. Delhi Transport Corporation</a> 2010(2) KLT 802

SC.     If the      compensation for loss of dependency is

recalculated       on the  basis  of   these    inputs,    the

compensation          would     come       to      7,68,000/-
</p>
<p id="p_8">(6000x12x16x2/3) instead of 4,76,000/- awarded by the

Tribunal. The difference would be 2,92,000/-. We are of

opinion that the compensation for love and affection for the

2 minor children is on the lower side. We enhance the

same to 40,000/-. The difference would be 30,000/-.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">MACA No. 741 of 2005          5</span>

The Tribunal has not awarded any compensation for loss of

estate for which a conventional amount should have been

fixed as 10,000/-. We are also inclined to enhance the

funeral expenses to 10,000/- from 5000/-. The husband

has not come forward to claim compensation for loss of

consortium. Therefore, we are not inclined to consider the

claim of the appellants for enhancement of compensation

for loss of consortium of the husband. We are not inclined

to enhance compensation under the other heads, since we

are of opinion that the amounts of compensation awarded

under the other heads are just and proper.
</p>
<p id="p_9">     6.     Adding together the appellants would get an

additional compensation of 3,37,000/- over and above what

has been awarded by the Tribunal. This amount would carry

9% interest from the date of the claim petition till date

payment. The 2nd respondent insurance company is directed

to deposit this amount also within two months.   The above

entire additional compensation shall be deposited in a

nationalised bank in a fixed deposit so as to get maximum

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">MACA No. 741 of 2005            6</span>

interest.    The appellants may after attaining maturity shall

approach the Tribunal for disbursal of whole or part of the

compensation so deposited showing the reasons for the same.

</p><p id="p_10">     With the above modification of the impugned award of the

Tribunal, the appeal is disposed of.
