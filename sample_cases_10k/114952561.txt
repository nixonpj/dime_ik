                      2 to 7) in O.S.No.464 of 1995 and 2nd defendant in O.S.No.172 of

                      temporary construction made in the third schedule property which is

<p id="p_23">

</p><p id="p_24">                            3. The brief facts of the case of the plaintiff, are as follows:

                            The suit property and the property situated on northern side

                      belongs to one Ameenal Beevi.       The said Ameenal Beevi sold the

                      first schedule property to the first defendant and the second

                      schedule property to the plaintiff. The first schedule property is a

                      vacant site.   The portion situated on southern side of the second

                      schedule property is the third schedule property.        The said third

                      schedule property was given to the second defendant for rent, over

                      which the second defendant has constructed a temporary structure

                      and he was paying rent to Ameenal Beevi. The remaining portion

                      after giving rent to the second defendant, was given to the first

                      defendant by Ameenal Beevi, over which the second defendant has

                      constructed a temporary structure and he was paying rent to

                      Ameenal Beevi.

</p><p id="p_26">                            4. It is also averred by the plaintiff that there is no permanent

                      wall in between the shops of defendants 1 and 2 and in respect of

                      the third and fourth schedule property, the defendants are paying

                      monthly rent to Ameenal Beevi. The first defendant was paying rent

                      for the first schedule property at Rs.50/- and the second defendant

                      for the third schedule property, was paying rent at Rs.50/- to

                      Ameenal Beevi. But after purchase of the second schedule property

                      from Ameenal Beevi by the plaintiff, the defendants are not paying

                      the rent for the vacant site.
</p>
<p id="p_27">

</p><p id="p_28">                            5. It is the case of the plaintiff that even the persons who are

                      enjoying very meager extent of the land, are paying rent at Rs.

                      250/- whereas the first defendant is paying very less amount

                      towards rent.   If the fourth schedule property is given for rent to

                      third persons, definitely he can get Rs.250/- as rent.        The first

                      defendant has to pay Rs.250/- per month from the date of purchase

                      of the second schedule property.       The defendants are also not

                      vacating the second schedule property though demanded by the

                      plaintiff. While so, the first defendant has filed a suit in O.S.No.172

                      of 1995, it is also grievance of the plaintiff that the first defendant,

                      apart from the fourth schedule property, has occupied a portion

                      adjourning the highways and he is liable to vacate the same,

                      otherwise, the plaintiff will be put to difficulty to reach his property

                      from the highways.

</p><p id="p_30">                            6. Aggrieved by the action of the defendants, the plaintiff

                      issued legal notice to the defendants. For the said legal notice, the

                      first defendant gave a reply notice containing false details and the

                      second defendant did not make any reply.          The property in which

                      the first defendant has laid a temporary shed, is a part of the

                      second schedule property and it is not the property which belongs to

                      him by purchase.        The plaintiff also denies the facts that the

                      property given for rent to the second defendant is also a part of the

                      first schedule property and it is the first defendant who has rented

                      the same to the second defendant.          Further, the claim of the first

                      defendant that he is entitled for the relief under City Tenant

                      Protection Act also denied by the plaintiff. Hence, the plaintiff has

                      filed the suit for the said reliefs.

                      schedule property was obtained from Ameenal Beevi for rent is

                      denied by the first defendant.     It is the contention of the first

                      defendant that the third schedule property lies on the northern side

                      of the first schedule property and the said first schedule property

                      was purchased by the first defendant, the second defendant taken

                      the third schedule property on rent and he paying the rent to the

                      first defendant and the temporary shed in the third schedule

                      property was put up by the first defendant and he is also paying tax

                      in respect of the said property.       On any occasion, no permanent

                      structure in the third schedule property was put up by the second

                      defendant.   The first defendant further states that the vacant site

                      measuring North-South 15 feet and East-West 15 feet in the second

                      schedule property was taken by the first defendant for rent.

                      Accordingly, the first defendant in the said vacant site has made

                      permanent walls and also permanent structure by putting asbestos

                      roof.   The first defendant was also paying water tax to the

                      Kadaiyanallur Municipality and he was also paying Rs.50/- as rent to

                      Ameenal Beevi. Hence, the first defendant is claiming relief under

                      the Tamil Nadu City Tenants Protection Act. The first defendant also

                      denied the sale of the plaintiff dated 30.05.1995.          The first

                      defendant need not to pay any rent to the plaintiff at the rate of Rs.

                      250/-.    Originally the first defendant was paying rent to Ameenal

                      Beevi at the rate of Rs.50/- and subsequently the sons of Ameenal

                      Beevi received the rent and made entry in the book and the first

                      defendant also paid rents from 1992 to 1995, whereas the said

                      book was retained by Ameenal Beevi, when he offered the rent in

                      the year 1995 April. The said Ameenal Beevi also demanded the

                      first defendant to resale the property to him, but the demand of the

                      Ameenal Beevi was refused.

                      sons of Ameenal Beevi and therefore, according to him, he is

                      entitled to the protection under City Tenants Protection Act. While

                      so, it is pertinent to note that the plaintiff purchased the second

                      schedule property from the original owner Ameenal Beevi by way of

                      sale deed dated 30.05.1995 under Ex.A1 and after purchase, she

                      issued quit notice dated 1.10.1995 under <a href="/doc/80042/" id="a_1">Section 106</a> of the

                      Transfer of Property Act to the defendants 1 and 2.         It is also

                      pertinent to note that the first defendant has purchased the first

                      schedule property from Ameenal Beevi, in respect of which, he

                      claimed declaration of title, which was rightly granted by the trial

                      Ex.A1 dated 30.05.1995 in respect of second schedule property, is

                      not legally valid and it is not binding upon him. However, in order to

                      prove the same, the first defendant has not produced any

                      documents nor he proved that the original owner Ameenal Beevi

                      had not sold the property to the plaintiff. Therefore, after purchase

                      Beevi after having purchased the second schedule property and

                      after issuing quit notice, she also terminated the tenancy. Hence,

                      schedule property, which are part of the second schedule property,

                      is higher than the extent of second schedule property, for which, the

                      plaintiff has no right or title and she cannot claim recovery of

                      Court to inspect the suit property.    He filed a report along with a

                      plan. In the report, it is observed that the major portion of the third

                      schedule property falls in the first schedule property and it is kept

                      vacant.     The   Advocate    Commissioner      has   mentioned    the

                      measurements of the first schedule property as North-South 11 feet

                      6 inches and 1 feet 6 inches as width and the second schedule

                      property measurement has been shown as North South 14 feet. In

                      between the first schedule and the second schedule property

                      measure 6 feet and 9 inches. There was no objection raised either

                      by the plaintiff and the defendants over the report of the Advocate

                      Commissioner.     The plaintiff has purchased the property from

                      Ameenal Beevi, situated on North South 15 feet and the first

                      defendant purchased the property situated on North South 18 feet

                      and this has been accepted by both the plaintiff and the first

                      defendant. Leaving the third schedule property, the plaintiff's

                      property North-South measurement shows 11½ feet and the first

                      defendant's property North-South measurement shows 14 feet.

                      Further the Commissioner report also reveals the fact that on the

                      South side of the first schedule property, there were road lines and

                      in between the road lines and the first schedule property, there is a

                      vacant site. The Commissioner has not measured the property with

                      the boundaries, however, he measured the property from the

                      constructed wall in the second schedule property.         It has to be

                      assessed that when both the parties admit that the property of the

                      Ameenal Beevi lies on the North, the measurement has been taken

                      by the Commissioner from the permanent construction of the wall.

                      The Commissioner report also shows that the measurement of the

                      second schedule property is 14 feet and the further Southern side

                      the measurement has been shown as 6 feet 9 inches and as per the

                      document, the first defendant North South measurement is 18 feet.

                      The first defendant is entitled for 4 feet out of 6 feet 9 inches in the

                      third schedule property, hence, the remaining 2 feet 9 inches

                      belongs to the plaintiff.

                      area alone lies in the first schedule property, hence, the 3/4th

                      portion of the third schedule property lies in the second schedule

                      property. It is the evidence of the first defendant that he only

                      constructed the permanent structure and the second defendant is

                      paying rent to him. Further, it is also the evidence of the first

                      defendant that the second schedule property was purchased by the

                      were road lines on the Southern side of the first schedule property

                      shown as a area with bushes. The first defendant has also deposed

                      clear evidence of the first defendant that there is no written

                      document for giving rent to Sahul Hameed. Further, the said Sahul

                      Hameed who was the tenant under first defendant, was not

                      examined by the first defendant. Further, it is also observed that for

                      the legal notice issued by the plaintiff, the second defendant who

                      claimed to be his tenant has not made any reply.     Hence, it has to

                      be presumed that the second defendant Sahul Hameed was

                      originally a tenant under the Ameenal Beevi and was never a tenant

                      of the second defendant.

</p><p id="p_49">                              18. In fact, the original owner who was examined as D.W.2

                      Ameenal Beevi has clearly deposed that she has sold the property

                      measuring North South 15 feet to the first defendant and the

                      property furthern North measuring 18 feet North South to the

                      plaintiff. The evidence of D.W.2 is different from              the chief

                      examination to cross examination regarding the occupation of Sahul

                      Hameed. Ex.B2 is the rental agreement.                In the said rent

                      agreement, the measurement has been shown as 15 X 15 feet. It is

                      the property which was rented to Sahul Hameed, hence, the

                      measurement has been shown as 15 feet. Ex.A2 proves that the

                      third schedule property is part of the second schedule property and

                      part of the first schedule property. From the said observation and

                      from     the   Commissioner   Report   and   also     Ex.A2,   the   lessor

                      measurement has been shown by the first defendant regarding the

                      North    South   measurement    and    the   larger   extent   has   been

                      purchased by the plaintiff and the said Sahul Hameed is not a

                      tenant of the first defendant and he is only a tenant under Ameenal

                      Beevi.    It is observed that the property shown as fourth schedule

                      property has been purchased by the plaintiff from Ameenal Beevi

                      and the same was admitted by the first defendant and the notice

                      canceling the rent by the plaintiff and she is entitled to recovery of

                      possession of the fourth schedule property, hence, the relief sought

                      by the plaintiff with regard to third schedule property, she is entitled

                      for the same. Accordingly, theses issues are answered in favour of

                      the plaintiff and against the defendant.
