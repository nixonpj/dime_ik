                        ----------------------------------------
                             R.S.A.No.634 of 2009
                        ----------------------------------------
                  Dated this the 10th day of August, 2009

                                   JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">       The Second Appeal is directed against the the judgment and decree

in A.S. 26/2007 on the file of the Sub Court, Koyilandy which arises from

the judgment and decree in O.S. No.151/2006 on the file of the Munsiff

Court, Koyilandy. The suit for injunction restraining the defendants, from

evicting    the plaintiff forcefully from the premises belonging to 1st

defendant-Municipality, was dismissed by the trial court and confirmed in

appeal     Hence the Second Appeal. The parties hereinafter referred to as

plaintiff and defendants as arrayed in the suit.
</p>
<p id="p_2">        2.    The plaintiff is conducting a workshop making gold covering

and silver ornaments in the plaint schedule room belonging to the 1st

defendant-Municipality.      It is his case that the plaint schedule room

developed leakage and parts of the concrete on the terrace started falling

down and due to the repeated requests, ultimately, in the month of May

2004 the 1st defendant-Municipality started repair works. Due to the said

repair works the plaintiff had to partly close the business and shift the

same to another building.        According to him, he had compelled to pay

an amount of Rs.87,000/- as rent to the other building for 29 months at the

rate of Rs. 3,000/- per month, that he had to incur expenses for shifting the

materials and hence the loss caused to him is solely due to the wilful

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">R.S.A. No. 634 of 2009                 -2-</span>

negligence and omission on the part of the Municipal Authorities to do the

repair works in time. It is also submitted by the plaintiff that even though

he approached the defendants for getting exemption from paying the rent

for the period of 29 months during which period the plaint schedule room

was under maintenance, his request fall in deaf ears. The 1st defendant-

Municipality also issued a notice dated 29.9.2009 demanding the rent.



</p><p id="p_3">       3.     In the written statement filed       by the defendants they

contended that the plaintiff is not a tenant but only a licensee, that they

put up an over head roof of          sheets for preventing the leakage, that

nobody was directed to surrender the premises for the purpose of repair

works and there was no need for the stoppage of business in the plaint

schedule room due to the repair works . It is also contended by them that

the plaintiff is not entitled to get any exemption from paying the rent and

that the plaintiff   has defaulted      payment of rent for a long period.

Therefore they       are constrained to issue a notice to        the plaintiff

demanding the payment of rent. In order to avoid the payment of rent,

the present suit was filed for injunction. They also contended that no

attempt was made by them to evict the plaintiff by force.

</p><p id="p_4">       4.     The evidence in this case consists of the oral testimony of

PW1 and Exts.A1 and A2 on the side of the plaintiff. No evidence was

adduced by the defendants.
</p>
<p id="p_5">       5.     The trial court noticed the fact that even though the plaintiff

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">R.S.A. No. 634 of 2009               -3-</span>

has stated that he is entitled to get an exemption of Rs. 87,000/- i.e the

amount he had paid for a period of 29 months at the rate of 3,000/- per

month to the other building, the only prayer in the suit is for an injunction

and no relief is claimed by the plaintiff for realisation of the said amount

which is alleged to be incurred due to the shifting of the materials and

business. The trial court held   that there is no evidence to prove that he

shifted his business to another building and he paid Rs. 3,000/- per month

as rent for 29 months.     At the same time the defendants contended that

the building required minor repairs because of the leakage and they put up

overhead roof sheets and thus the leakage is solved and that for the said

purpose there is no need for the plaintiff to vacate the building .



</p><p id="p_6">       6.     The trial court also considered the legality of Ext.A1 notice

issued by the defendants directing the plaintiff to vacate the premises.

Admittedly, the plaintiff is a defaulter of licence fee for a long period.

Referring to Section 215 (8) of the Kerala Municipalities Act, the trial court

held that if there is any default beyond the period for which deposit is

made, it is mandatory on the part of the Secretary to demand the Licencee

to remit the Licence fee together with such penalty or interest within 7 days

of the service of such notice and in case of failure, the Secretary shall

cause the premises to be closed down temporarily and the person or

persons in occupation shall be got removed with the assistance of Police or

otherwise.    In such circumstances the trial court held that the plaintiff is

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">R.S.A. No. 634 of 2009                 -4-</span>

not entitled to get any reliefs as prayed for and dismissed the suit.

</p><p id="p_7">       7.     In the appeal filed by the plaintiff the lower appellate court

also re-appreciated and re-considered the questions raised by him and

held that the findings arrived at by the trial court on facts, circumstances

and evidence,       requires no interference.     The lower appellate court

observed that there is no material to show that the plaint schedule room

was in a dilapidated condition and that the plaintiff had suffered a huge

loss and earnings because of the repair works and consequent shifting of

the business to the other building. The lower appellate court also observed

that there is no prayer for any compensation from the defendants for the

loss sustained by him by the consequent shifting of the business to other

building and     that the plaintiff has not brought out any material to show

that he was unable to conduct the business in the plaint schedule room

during the time when the repair was effected. The legality of Ext.A1 notice

was also considered by the lower appellate court and held that Ext.A1

notice is a valid notice issued under the circumstances stated in the written

statement filed by the defendants.        Finally, the Lower appellate court

agreed with the findings of the trial court and confirmed the same.

</p><p id="p_8">       8.      The findings of the courts below are based on facts evidence

and circumstances.      I   find that no    grounds    are made out by the

plaintiff/appellant to interfere with the findings of the courts below, by

invoking    this Court's jurisdiction under Section 100 of the C.P.C. No

questions of law much less any substantial question of law arises for

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">R.S.A. No. 634 of 2009                -5-</span>

consideration in this appeal. This appeal fails and dismissed in limine.

</p><p id="p_9">       9.     The learned counsel for the plaintiff/appellant submitted that

the plaintiff is entitled to get exemption of rent for the period when the

plaint schedule room         was under maintenance ,that the plaintiff is

compelled to shift the business to other building for the reason that he was

not in a position to carryout the business in the plaint schedule room since

major repair works        were  going on there.     Even though the plaintiff

approached the Municipal Authorities for getting exemption from paying

the rent during the period when the plaint schedule room was under

repair, the Municipal Authorities dismissed his petition in that regard. The

counsel for the plaintiff/appellant requested that the plaintiff      may be

permitted to approach the Appellate Authority under the <a href="/doc/1986722/" id="a_1">Municipalities Act</a>

to ventilate his grievances. In such circumstances this Court directs the

Appellate Authority to consider the plaintiff's statutory appeal if the plaintiff

file the same within a period of one month from today and pass appropriate

orders, as expeditiously as possible without considering the question of

limitation in filing that appeal
