</p><p id="p_9">1.            The appeal is for enhancement of compensation for the

property acquired through a notification dated 28.07.1987.             The

Collector had originally determined a compensation of ` 5584/- per acre

for barani land, which was the category of land that the land owner was

possessed of and from whom the property was acquired.         Before the

Reference Court in a claim for enhancement, the land owner had placed

reliance on a judgment of the District Judge, Hoshiarpur in Kashmiro

Devi Vs. State of Punjab in LAC No.52 of 1993 decided on 05.06.1995.

The Reference Court had enhanced the compensation at ` 25,000/- per

acre for barani land with 15% severance charges as damages.            The

reference to this judgment was discarded by the Reference Court on the

ground that there was no proof that the property, which was acquired
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1"> RFA No.1522 of 2000                                  -2-</span>

was of the same quality as the property, which was dealt with in LAC

No.52 of 1993. I do not think that it will be possible to obtain 100%

congruity of the quality of land and the Courts making an approximation

in considering only whether the property acquired was of particular

category and was through a same notification and same village. In this

case, it is not denied that the compensation, which was in LAC No.52 of

1993 was with reference to the very same notification for a very same

category of land in the same village. It was only appropriate that the

same compensation as determined in the said case was also applied for

the benefit of the land owner.       The amount of compensation as

determined at ` 22,500/- would stand enhanced to ` 25,000/- per acre

with damages for severance, which I will estimate at 15% of the value of

the land, which is determined for the acquired land.       The statutory

benefits under Section 23(1)(A) will enure to the valuation for the land

and the severance damages would attract interest under <a href="/doc/1945807/" id="a_1">Section 28</a> of

the Land Acquisition Act and no other benefit under other Sections.

</p><p id="p_10">2.         With these observations, the appeal is allowed.
