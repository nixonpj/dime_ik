<p id="p_1">1.	Applicant
IFCI Limited, a financial institution, which is one of the secured
creditors of the respondent No.1 Company in liquidation, has moved
this application requesting for holding meeting of the Assets Sale
Committee for revising the upset price of land admeasuring 1,46,195
sq.meters of the Company situated at village Katol, Taluka: Kalol,
District: Panchmahals and also for fresh advertisement to sell lease
hold land of plot Nos.118, 119 and 120 A admeasuring 18,322, situated
at GIDC Kalol. Counsel for the petitioner submitted that all the
secured creditors are before the Court and agree to downward revision
of the upset price  instead of calling the meeting.
</p> 

<p id="p_2">2.	Counsel
for the applicant pointed that the land at village Katol was
attempted to be sold more than twice through public auctions with an
upset price of Rs.6.29 crores. However, at that price no bids were
received. Auction advertisement, therefore, failed. He further
pointed that Bank of Baroda had also valued the property fixing the
upset price of Rs.4.50 crores, which may be adopted as a fresh upset
price for the new advertisement to be issued.  
</p>
 

<p id="p_3">3.	Learned
advocates for the parties for either the secured creditors as well as
Official Liquidator agree that in past attempts were made to sell the
said land with an upset price of Rs.6.29 crores. Auctions, however,
failed for want of any bid. 
</p>
 

<p id="p_4">4.	My
attention was also drawn to an order dated 18.6.2010 passed by
learned Single Judge in Official Liquidator's Report No.7 of 2010
wherein, the Court had permitted the Official Liquidator to approach
for refixing the upset price for the properties in question.
</p> 

<p id="p_5">5.	Under
the circumstances, since the previous attempts to sell the property
had failed, the Official Liquidator is permitted to readvertise the
sale of 1,46,195 sq.meters of the land of the Company situated at
Katol at an upset price of Rs.4.50 crores, all other terms remaining
unchanged. Simultaneously, the Official Liquidator shall also
advertise the sale of leasehold land of plot Nos.118, 119 and 120 A
admeasuring 18,322 sq.meters situated at village Katol on the same
upset price previously fixed also on the same terms and conditions
previously advertised. Such advertisement shall be carried in two
local newspapers of Indian Express (English) and Gujarat Samachar
(Gujarati) of Ahmedabad and Vadodara editions respectively.  The
advertisement may indicate that the bids received in seal cover will
be presented before the Court and opened on 25th February,
2011, on which date inter se biding shall take place. 
</p>
 

<p id="p_6">6.	The
Official Liquidator shall file report on the basis of bids that may
be received as also verify the claims of the secured creditors. Those
secured creditors who have lodged the claim may do so within 4 weeks
from today. Communication will be made to such creditors by the
Official Liquidator. 
</p>
 

<p id="p_7">7.	Counsel
for the Standard Chartered Bank, clarified that though at the time
Official Liquidator filed his report dated 25.10.2010, the said Bank
had not filed its claim since then. The Bank shall also lodge its
claim with the Official Liquidator.
</p> 

<p id="p_8">8.	With
these directions, this application is disposed of. 
</p>
