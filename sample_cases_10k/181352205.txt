                                           JUDGMENT 
</pre>
<p id="p_1">1.             Plaintiff   has   filed   the   present   suit   to   pass   a   decree   of   recovery   of   Rs. 

2,22,915.30/­ in favour of the plaintiff and against the defendants with interest @ 18% 

from December, 1985 along with costs of the suit. 
</p>
<p id="p_2">2.             Plaintiffs Version:­

               In the present suit, plaintiff stated that the Defendant No. 1 is a transport 

corporation and defendants No. 2 and 3 are its officers appointed by defendant No. 1 to 

discharge the functions of the corporation. The defendant No. 1 has provided various 

facilities to its employees and one of them is to provide medicine to its employees as and 

when they need it. To make the scheme effective and successful, the defendants have 

selected a panel of Medical Stores and shops. The defendants have given various code 

numbers to these medical stores/shops to deal with the purposes of their transactions. 

The plaintiff is running a shop at shop No. 11,  Super Bazar Market, J­block, Saket, New 

Delhi­17 of Chemists and Druggists. The above plaintiff's name is  on the panel of the 

defendants.   The   code   number  allotted   to  the   plaintiff   is   0429   by  the   defendants   for 

submitting   the   bills   and   receiving   the   amounts.   That   the   plaintiff   used   to   issue   the 

medicines   to   the   employee   of   the   defendants   and   used   to   get   the   money   from   the 

defendants after submitting bills.  The above shop M/S Gogia Medicos in a joint Hindu 

Family business and is being run in the surname of the family. Therefore, the registration 

Suit No. 677/10         M/s  Gogia Medicos Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation                       Page No. 2/26
 of the firm is not necessary and institution of the above suit is not barred by <a href="/doc/797638/" id="a_1">Section 69</a> 

of the Indian Partnership Act. 
</p>
<p id="p_3">               The   plaintiff   submitted   a   bill   of   Rs.   2,57,   915.30/­   for   the   period   from 

01.04.1985   to   30.11.1985   on   various   dates   in   the   office   of   the   defendants   for   the 

medicines sold to the employees of the defendants and the same bill was duly received 

by the office of the defendants. Out of the above amount, the defendants have paid only 

Rs. 35,000/­ through two different cheques of Rs. 15,000/­ dated 24.10.1985 and Rs. 

20,000/­ dated 21.01.1986 respectively. Therefore, an amount of Rs. 2,22,915.30/­ is due 

in favour of the plaintiff from the side of defendants. The plaintiff had been visiting the 

office   of   the   defendants   and   making   personal   request   and   enquiries   for   the   above 

payment but to no effect. He finally sent a registered letter on 05.10.1987 which was duly 

received in their office. The letter was replied by Sh. M.R. Arya, Administrative Office 

(H.Q)   through   his   letter   dated   23.10.1987   vide   No.   Admn­I,   7/(27)/87.   Finally,   the 

plaintiff issued a legal notice on 28.04.1988 demanding the outstanding bills. The notice 

was   replied   by   the   defendants   through   counsel   on   30.05.1988   in   usual   form.   It   is 

submitted that the defendants have admitted about the bills and about the outstanding of 

the   bills,   but   they   have   taken   a   very   strange   plea   that   they   are   investigating   the 

genuineness of the bills. The plaintiff has suffered a big loss of more than Rs. 50,000/­ 

in his business due to non payment of his outstanding bills of Rs. 2,22,915.30/­.   The 

plaintiff is  entitled to receive Rs. 2,22,915.30/­ with 18% interest from December, 1985. 

The defendants have not refused to make the payments. On the other hand, they have 

admitted the claim of the above plaintiff. But they are not releasing the above amount for 


Suit No. 677/10         M/s  Gogia Medicos Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation                     Page No. 3/26
 the reasons best known to them. Because the amount of claim has been admitted by the 

defendants,   therefore,   the   defendants   can   not   take   the   plea   that   the   matter   is   under 

investigation. The defendants are estopped from their own conduct from contending that 

the matter is under investigation. They have already taken two and half year under the 

pretext of investigation of the bills. 
</p>
<p id="p_4">               Since the defendants were liable to make the payment of Rs. 2,22,915.30/­ 

in December, 1985 and due to their delay in making the payments, the plaintiff has 

suffered a loss of more than Rs. 50,000/­ but the plaintiff is confining his claim upto Rs. 

2,22,915.30/­ with 18% interest from December. 1985 till the final decree of the court. 

All   the   defendants   are   jointly   and   severally   liable   to   make   the   payment   of   Rs. 

2,22,915.30/­ with 18% interest to the plaintiff. Hence, the present suit has been filed for 

the above mentioned relief. 
</p>
<p id="p_5">3.             Defendants Version:­

               In the WS, the defendants have denied all the claims of the plaintiff stating 

that   the contents of the plaint are vague giving no particulars of cash memos with 

amount thereof, of the patients to whom medicines were issued, of the unit in which the 

employees were working and the details of the payment received. The plaintiff have 

further failed to give copies of account books to the defendants relating to the claim in 

suit which account books are basis of suit. The plaintiff should be ordered to give better 

particulars U/o 6  Rule 5 CPC and to furnish copy of the account books and other copies 

failing   which   the   suit   be   ordered   to   be   dismissed   with   costs.     The   scheme   as   new 

Medical Scheme was formulated vide office order No. 8, dated 28.04.1984 for providing 


Suit No. 677/10         M/s  Gogia Medicos Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation                    Page No. 4/26
 prompt medical facilities to the employees of DTC and their family members in cases of 

sickness. Defendants have also stated some relevant features regarding the scheme.

</p><p id="p_6">             Further, defendants stated that about 550 chemists and about 1260 doctors 

in Delhi were placed on the panel of DTC for issuing of medicines to the employee of 

the DTC under New Medical Scheme as detailed above. The empaneled chemists and the 

doctors were to carry out and copy with the directions issued by DTC from time to time. 

The schems was put into operation w.e.f 01.05.1984 and with in a few months. Some of 

the employees were getting issued medicines of more than Rs. 100/­ at one and the some 

time each for himself and for other members of his family, the DTC issued office Order 

No. 35, dated 15.10.1984 which contained instructions to the following by the empaneled 

chemists and   the doctors.   The plaintiff  used to issue medicines to the employees of 

defendants corporation in gross  violations of terms and conditions of the supply and the 

plaintiff had been paid money erroneously. It is admitted that Rs. 35,000/­ has been paid 

to the plaintiff. Infact the plaintiff in addition to the aforesaid amount has been paid 

much more though erroneously. The true position is that according to computer different 

sums amounting to Rs. 6,65,046.75/­ stands paid to the plaintiff and the said amount 

stood   erroneously   paid.   The   circumstances   under   which   the   amount   has   been 

erroneously paid and the claimed amount is not payable are as under:­

             That   about   1,50,000/­   persons   has   been   covered   by  the   scheme.   On   the 

average about Rs. 3,00,000/­ cash memos had been issued by the empaneled chemists 

and similar number of prescription slips had been issued by the empaneled doctors per 

month during the period 01.05.1984 to 15.07.1985 and the dealing staff did not find time 


Suit No. 677/10      M/s  Gogia Medicos Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation                Page No. 5/26
 to   check   6,00,000/­   cash   memos   and   prescriptions   in   a   month.   This   resulted   into   a 

payment of about about Rs. 18,00,00,000/­ to the empaneled chemists and doctors for the 

bills/cash memos under the circumstances mentioned above. The bill of the plaintiff and 

other chemists had been erroneously cleared and paid prior to 16.03.1985 and after 31st 

March,   1985   without   proper   chemists.   On   account   of   the   fraud   played   upon   the 

defendants DTC, the cheque for Rs. 20,242.25/­ had also been issued to the plaintiff 

under the same circumstances as mentioned above and the amount of the same remained 

unpaid till the fraud/scandal came to light as stated  hereinafter and the payment of the 

cheque was also with helds. The reason for non payment of the cheque was that firstly it 

was sent to a wrong party and then it was returned to DTC, the same was not given to 

the plaintiff because of financial stringencies. The plaintiff filed a suit on the basis of the 

said cheque in the court of S.J.I, Class Delhi which was dismissed and RFA No. 50/89 is 

pending before the Hon'ble High Court of Delhi.

             the allotment of code No. 0429 as a panel chemist. I had received all  

             the circular sent by defendant's corporation from time to time. Vol. I

             some   times   used   to   bear   stamps   of   the   panel   doctor   also   but  



Suit No. 677/10       M/s  Gogia Medicos Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation                 Page No. 8/26
              signature used to be always there. The DTC had never sent us the  

             specimen signatures of the panel doctor. As the patient defendant  

             family members used to bring prescription issued by panel doctor on  

             the prescription slip issued by the DTC. The DTC used to issue a  

             prescription pad. It was not mandatory that prescription slips must  

             have been signed and stamped by the panel doctor for issuing the  

             medicines. Initially there were no rules and regulations informed by  

             DTC   for   issuing   the   medicines   but   later   on   the   order   35   was  

             circulated by DTC showing the rules and regulations. I had never  

             compared   the  signatures  obtain on  the  cash  memo  by patient/his  

             dependent family members/employees with any specimen signatures  

             as   no   specimen   signatures   of   employees   or   dependent   family  

             members were provided by the DTC. I do not  know whether any  

             index   card   showing   the   names   of   employee   and   their   dependent  

             family   members   along   with   the   signatures   or   thumb   impressions  

             were issued to every DTC employee benefited under this medicine  

             scheme. At the time of issuing of the cash memo, it was mandatory to  

             write   the  name  of   the   medicine, quantity of  the  medicine, batch  

             number, expiry date, amount and doctors name. After issuing some  

             office order I was suppose to issue smaller packing of the medicines  

             described by the panel doctor. It is correct that I can issue medicine  

             prescribed only for three days and in cash of chronic deceased I was  

Suit No. 677/10       M/s  Gogia Medicos Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation                 Page No. 9/26
              entitled to give medicine for 15 days. No such rule in office orders  

             35 and 8 whereby I suppose to give all the medicines prescribed in  

             the   prescription   slip   and   I   was   not   to   do   give   the   complete  

             dispensing of medicine. It is correct that I was not allowed to give a  

             cheaper  substitute  of   any medicine prescribed  in the prescription  

             slip. It is correct that it was mentioned in the office order 35 and 8  

             that if the cash memo exceeds 50 Rs. Then I was not allowed to give  

             medicine to the employee or dependent family member in that cash  

             the medicine is to purchased from the super bazar. It is correct that I  

             have received a list of in admissible medicines as per rules I was not  

             supposed   to   give   in   admissible   medicines   mentioned   in   the   list.  

             Besides   that   there   was   a   book   namely   CGHS   Scheme   by  

             Muthhuswami. Where the names of the in admissible medicine was  

             mentioned   and   I   was   not   supposed   to   give   those   in   admissible  

             medicine.  I am  income tax payee.  I am also maintaining record  

             regarding purchase of the medicines. I do not remember as to how  

             much medicines were purchased during the year 1985­86. I have not  

             brought the said record today in the court. I can not produce the  

             same in the court because after the assessment of sale tax etc such  

             record   can   not   be   maintained   for   such   a   long   period.   This   suit  

             pertains to the period 01.04.1985 to 30.11.1985. I also can not say as  

             to whether I can   produce the balance sheet, income tax return or  

Suit No. 677/10       M/s  Gogia Medicos Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation                  Page No. 10/26
              the sale tax record, for the said period or not. I have to check from  

             my office whether the same are still available. It is wrong to suggest  

             that I am not producing the aforesaid record because I have never  

             been filing the returns and maintaining the record. I can not produce  

             the account books for the said period, now since it is very long. It is  

             wrong to suggest that I am not producing the account books because  

             I was not maintaining the same. It is correct that there was condition  

             in the office order No. 8 and 35 that I can not supply medicines of  

             the   value   more   than   Rs.   50/­   per   prescription.   In   the   case   any  

             prescription   for   the   medicines   of   more   than   Rs.   50/­   is   being  

             produced, either I can return the  same or ask him to purchase the  

             medicines for the value upto Rs. 50/­ or to write off some medicines  

             so that the value may be decreased, upto Rs. 50/­. I did not use to  

             advice,   the   employee   himself   used   to   do   so.   I   do   not   remember  

             whether there was any condition that such dispensing with was not  

             allowed. It is correct that as per the rules, I was obliged to mention  

             expiry date and batch number on the bills. I can not say whether the  

             batch number and expiry date of the medicines were mentioned on  

             the bills. It is correct that the bills were issued in duplicate. I do not  

             have the duplicate copies of the bills. However, the originals are  

             with DTC. Since assessment had taken place long back, I did not  

             preserve the duplicate copies of the bills..............

Suit No. 677/10       M/s  Gogia Medicos Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation                  Page No. 11/26
                     .............It   is   correct   that   the   signatures   of   the   doctor  

             prescribing the prescription for giving the medicines to the employee  

             or patient is must. However, I can not say whether stamp of a doctor  

             is   also   must   before   giving   medicine   on   that   prescription.   The  

             prescription slips and bills are numbered as 1 to 40 forming part of  

             Ex.   PW1/D­1.   The   objections   shown   as   NA   on   the   bills   are   not  

             correct. It is correct that wherever the objection NED is exists, the  

             expiry date is not mentioned. Vol. The expiry date get cleared by the  

             batch   number   of   the   manufacturer.   It   is   correct   that   the   bills  

             containing   in   the   Ex.   PW1/D2   (nine   bundles)   does   not   show   the  

             expiry date of the medicines written thereon in the bills. It is correct  

             that as per office order No. 8 and 35, I was not supposed to give the  

             bigger   packet   prescribed   by   the   doctor   in   the   prescription.   It   is  

             correct that in prescription No. 358796 issued by the doctor, four  

             number of the medicines were prescribed by the doctor and I had  

             given only three medicines as per bill No. 8673 dated 16.12.1984.  

             The   said   bill   is   Ex.   PW1/D3.   Similarly,   in   the   prescription   No.  

             158098 four numbers of medicines were prescribed by the doctor  

             and   I   had   issued   only   three   medicines.   The   same   is   also   Ex.  

             PW1/D3. The witness was shown the whole bundle Ex. PW1/D3 and  

             the witness admits the same that the bills issued by him shows the  

             incomplete  dispensing  of  medicines. It  is correct  that in the bills  

Suit No. 677/10       M/s  Gogia Medicos Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation                   Page No. 12/26
              mentioned   in   bundle   Ex.   PW1/D5   shows   certain   bills   exceeding  

             amount   of   Rs.   50/­,   The   said   fact   is   also   mentioned   in   the   list  

             attached with the said bundle Ex. PW1/D6 shows the discrepancies  

             in the bills with regard to no expiry date not admissible and excess  

             amount. I had received the circular dated 06.06.1984 issued by DTC  

             during the scheme and the same is Ex. PW1/D7. I had not received  

             Mark   and   B.   It   is   correct   that   Ex.   PW1/D8   was   received   by   me  

             during the said scheme.

             "........The scheme was started from 01.05.1984 and was closed on  

             31.01.1986.  During  the period of validity of the said scheme, the  

             scheme was misused by the employees, panel doctors and chemist  

             and thereafter a question was raised in Parliament and the scheme  

             was immediately closed. It is also admitted that when the scheme  

             was enforce some bills were reimbursed as per rules and regulations  

             to the chemist. The reimbursements were made after the  scrutiny of  

             bills was made. Vol. Generally annual turn over of DTC remains up  

             to 70 to 80 lacs but during the period of this scheme the turn over  

             shoot up to 18 corers annually and when the papers were sent to the  

             Parliament, Parliament ordered to stop the scheme immediately. I do  

Suit No. 677/10       M/s  Gogia Medicos Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation                     Page No. 13/26
              not remember the date, month or year when the facts of misused of  

             the scheme came to the knowledge of DTC. The DTC had stopped  

             the payment of the employees, chemist and doctors and screening  

             committee was appointed by DTC. The DTC had also taken action  

             against   its   employees,   chemist   and   panel   doctors.   Some   of   the  

             employees were also put under suspension. Similarly, the action was  

             also   initiated   against   the   doctors   and   chemist   on   panel,   by   de­

             paneling, the doctors and chemist found misusing the scheme. I do  

             not   have   personal   knowledge   about   criminal   action   against   the  

             employees or chemist or doctors as it is the matter of record. It is  

             wrong to suggest that the DTC at no point of time issue any letter or  

             notice to de­panel the plaintiff and also did not make any complaint  

             to any department because the plaintiff always obeyed the rules and  

             instructions as per the scheme and orders. The plaintiff, however,  

             has been violating the rules and instructions.

<p id="p_18">                    DTC issued medical card to each employee of DTC, showing  

             the name of employee as well as his/her dependent family members  

             along with their signatures/thumb impression and age. It is wrong to  

             suggest   that   the   medical   card   did   not   bear   the   signatures/thumb  

             impression of any dependent family members. I can not produce the  

             medical   card   with   signatures/thumb   impression   of   any  dependent  

             family members of DTC employees as the same remained with the

              employees. One copy of the said medical card is always retained by  

             DTC. We have not filed the medical card or any copy there out on  

             record.   The   prescription   slips   by   doctors  used   to   be  prepared  in  

             triplicate out of which one copy was retained by the doctor, one with  

             the   employee   and   the   third   was   forwarding   to   chemist.   The  

             prescription slips used to  be sent by the doctors to DTC along with  

             their bills fortnightly. The DTC had never issued any letter to the  

             chemist or the prescribing doctors raising objections that the bills  

             submitted by the plaintiff did not have the seal of the prescribing  

             doctors as the same is mentioned in rules. I can not tell any date,  

             month of year as to when the DTC discovered that the plaintiff was  

             exploiting the scheme. (Vol. When the screening committee screened  

             the   documents,   I   came   to   know).   I   was   not   in   the   screening  

             committee. I do not remember as to when I had seen the report of  

             the screening committee for the first time. The screening was not  

             done in my presence. DTC did not write any letter to the plaintiff  

             regarding exploiting of scheme by plaintiff even after receiving the  

             report   of   screening   committee.   I   do   not   have   any   personal  

             knowledge whether DTC or Screening Committee made any enquiry  

             into the aspect that the medicines for which the bills were raised by  

             the plaintiff were actually supplied or not supplied to the patients. I 

             do not remember whether  DTC had written any letter to the plaintiff 

Suit No. 677/10      M/s  Gogia Medicos Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation                 Page No. 15/26
              pointing out any irregularities or violation of rules and regulation, 

             after receiving bills along with prescriptions from the plaintiff. The 

             scheme was videly exploited, I do not want to say anything about the 

             plaintiff exclusively. The document Ex. DW2/1 and Ex. PW1/D9 
             does not bear my signatures. The same were neither prepared 
             in   my   presence   nor   were   prepared   by   me.   It   is   wrong   to 
             suggest that the report submitted the screening committee is 
             not correct. Ex. PW1/D1 to Ex. PW1/D3 were neither prepared 
             in present nor were prepared by me.   It is wrong to suggest 
             that the plaintiff is entitled to the amount claimed in the suit. 
             It is wrong to suggest that all bills submitted by the plaintiff 
             are   admissible.   The   DTC   has   maintained     records   of   all 
             payments made to plaintiff against the scheme but DTC has 
             not   produced   any   statement   of   account.   (Vol.   DTC   has 
             produced Ex. DW2/1 which is screening committee report). It 
             is correct that there is no detail of the payment made to the 
             plaintiff   against   the   bills   submitted   by   the   plaintiff,   in   Ex.

             in the DTC dispensary after joining.   The said dispensary is still 

             working.   The DTC dispensaries are in all depots of DTC and are 



Suit No. 677/10      M/s  Gogia Medicos Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation               Page No. 16/26
              manned by medical and paramedical staff.   The said dispensaries 

             continued functioning even during the continuance of the medical 

             scheme for its employees. I do not remember the exact date as to 

             when the screening committee was constituted. (vol.) perhaps it was 

             in the month of July 1986.  Every region had one committee. I was 

             made member of the committee for south region.   The committee 

             constituted   three   members,   one   myself   and   the   others   were   one 

             administrative officer and one Accounts officer.  I never scrutinized 

             any bills submitted by the chemists in the medical scheme prior to 

             the formation of screening committee.  I do not know whether any 

             scrutiny used to be done by other medical officers of the bill prior to 

             the   formation   of   the   screening  committee.   Within a  week of   its 

             constitution, the screening committee started functioning.  Ex. DW 

             2/1 was neither prepared by me nor it bears my signatures at any 

             place.  The noting on the bills in red pen are the discrepancies noted 

             by me from the angle of medical discrepancies.   NED means 'no 

             expiry date.' It is correct that from the batch no. the date of expiry 

             can be verified from the manufacturers.  It is correct that in the cash 

             memo no. 24875 dated 24/9 serial numbered as 10 in Ex. PW­1/2, 

             the   batch   nos.   are   mentioned   against   the   medicines   rounded   and 

             remarked   by   me   in   red.       Same   is   the   position   against   all   bills 

             submitted   by   the   plaintiff   in  Ex.  PW  1/D2.    The  observations  at

             26334,26332,25986,26855,   28430   is   not   my   observation.     The 

             abbreviations N.A. means 'not admissible', NED means "no expiry 

             date", ID means "incomplete dispensing". I have submitted the bills 

             to  the  administrative  department  after screening.   Again said, the 

             screening committee submitted all original bills to the administrative 

             department.
</p>
<p id="p_20">                    The   scrutiny   was   done   by   the   screening   committee   on   the 

             original   bills   submitted   by   the   plaintiff.   It   is   correct   that   the 

             observations were mentioned by me during screening from medical 

             point of view on the original cash memos submitted by the plaintiff. 

             My signatures are at point A on Ex. DW­2/1 (colly).  Except the bills 

             mentioned in the sheet dated 15/01/1997 bearing my signatures at 

             Point A, I did not mention any observation on any other bill. It is not 

             in   my   knowledge   as   to   whether   the   report   of   the   screening 

             committee was ever sent to the plaintiff as it was not my job. I did 

             not make any objection regarding false medical prescription. It is 

             correct that if any discrepancy of false medical prescription is found 

             by   the   screening   committee   the   said   objection   was   raised   by  the 

             medical office or not by the account and administrative officials. In 

             the bills/claims raised by the plaintiff, I did not make any objections 

             for false medical prescription, as mentioned by me in para No. 5 of 


Suit No. 677/10       M/s  Gogia Medicos Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation                  Page No. 18/26
                my affidavit. It is wrong to suggest that the suit filed by the plaintiff 

               is not false or frivolous............."
</p>
<pre id="pre_4">(d)            Arguments heard. Record perused.

(e)            It is well settled rule of law that in civil cases the burden of proof upon the 

</pre><p id="p_21">plaintiff is preponderance of probabilities i.e after considering  the evidence lead by both 

the parties, the court has to weigh in whose favour the probabilities lie or in other words 

whose version seems   to be more probable. Further, it is also well established legal 

principle that the onus to prove its case is always upon the plaintiff and the suit of the 

plaintiff has to stand on its own legs.
</p>
<p id="p_22">(f)            During course of arguments, counsel for defendants has raised a issue of 

litigation. It is argued on behalf of the defendants that the suit is not within the period of 

limitation and has been filed after the expiry of period of limitation. On the other hand, 

plaintiff has argued that the suit has been filed within period of limitation. Further, the 

plaintiff   has   relied   upon   the   judgment  Pradeshiya   Industrial   &amp;   Investment 

Corporation   of   UP   Limited  Vs.  M/s   Bell   Polymers   &amp;   Ors   in   CS   No.   888/1996 

decided on 24.08.2012 by the Hon'ble High Court of Delhi. 

</p><p id="p_23">               It is clear in view of the above quoted judgment relied upon by the plaintiff 

that defendants have not taken the plea of limitation anywhere in the pleading and no 

issue   has   been   raised   by   the   defendants.   Therefore,  at   the   stage   of   final   arguments, 

defendants can not take the plea of limitation and reopen the trial. 

</p><p id="p_24">(g)            Plaintiff has filed the present suit for recovery. The admitted facts are that:­

</p><p id="p_25">(i)            That the the defendant No. 1 started a scheme for supplying medicines to its 

Suit No. 677/10         M/s  Gogia Medicos Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation                  Page No. 19/26
 employees. The plaintiff applied for empanelment with the defendant No. 1 under the 

scheme. I applied in the prescribed proforma. In the prescribed proforma the rules were 

mentioned.   The   DTC   granted   the   plaintiff   empanlement   under   the   said   scheme   and 

alloted the code No. 429. The code number was probably allotted for the purposed of 

convenience in administration work. The DTC used to issue a prescription pad to its 

panel doctors who after examining the patients (the employees of DTC and its dependent 

members ) would prescribed the medicines on this form. The said form was in triplicate. 

One copy was retained by the doctors, second copy was for the chemists which was the 

original copy, the last copy was retained by the employee. The holder of this prescription 

used to come to the plaintiff and purchase/collect the prescribed medicines for which the 

plaintiff would make a full bill which was counter signed by the patients receiving the 

medicines. Even the dependent of the employee of the defendants, would counter signed 

the bill of the chemists. The said person would receive the medicines but no payment 

was ever made.  The bills were being made in duplicate. As per the rules, the plaintiff 

would submit all the copies of the bills and doctor prescriptions with the defendants 

every 15 days or some time monthly. 
</p>
<p id="p_26">(ii)          I   submitted   that   original   bills   along   with   original   doctors   prescriptions 

submitted to the defendant No. 1 accompanied with the statements in original on the 

prescribed proforma bearing the name of the plaintiff, copy number of the plaintiff, 

registration number of the plaintiff, period for which the bills were being accompanied 

with particular statement, employees description, token number, medical card number, 

prescription  number,  bill  number and date, amounts of the bill. The said statements 


Suit No. 677/10       M/s  Gogia Medicos Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation                 Page No. 20/26
 showing the total amount claimed vide each page of the statements accompanied with 

that   particular   summary   slip.   The   concerned   dealing   clerk   used   to  acknowledge   the 

above said original documents from the plaintiff and the acknowledgment was used to be 

given   on   the   summary   slips   after   verifying   whether   all   the   bills   etc   stated   in   the 

statements were enclosed with the summary. The said statements used to be separately 

prepared for separate depots/offices/workshop. Plaintiff has filed the carbon copies of 

the   statements   and   the   summary   slips   bearing   acknowledgment/receipt   of   defendant 

No­1.
</p>
<p id="p_27">               Now,   as   per   plaintiff,   plaintiff   submitted   submitted   a   bill   of   Rs. 

2,57,915.30/­ for the period of 01.04.1985 to 30.11.1985 but defendants paid only Rs. 

35,000/­ through cheque and has not paid remaining amount despite several requests and 

service of legal notice. On the other hand, as per the defendants the plaintiff has failed to 

give   copies   of   accounts   book   to   the   defendants   relating   to   the   claim   and   further, 

defendants   have   alleged   that   due   to   misuse   of   the   medical   health   scheme   of   the 

defendants, the payment of the bills after 31.03.1985 was withhold. Defendants have also 

alleged that there was gross violation of rules and regulations of the medical health 

scheme   of   the   defendant   No.   1   by   the   plaintiff   in   collusion   with   the   employees   of 

defendant No. 1. 
</p>
<p id="p_28">(h)            Plaintiff has filed the suit for recovery of amounts, therefore, the onus is 

upon the plaintiff to show that the plaintiff has purchased the medicines and has supplied 

the   medicines   to   the   defendants   but   plaintiff   has   not     filed   any   documentary   proof 

regarding purchase of medicines for his chemist shop and subsequently has sold the 


Suit No. 677/10         M/s  Gogia Medicos Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation                   Page No. 21/26
 medicines. During cross examination, PW­1 has deposed that

                      "I   am   income   tax   payee.   I   am   regularly   giving   the  
              income tax and sales tax to the respective department. I do  
              not  remember whether I have filed the balance sheet on the  
              record of the court file. I can not say whether I have not  
              filed   any   documentary   proof   for   the   outstanding   amount  
              towards   the   defendant.   I   am   also   maintaining   record  
              regarding purchase of the medicines. I do not remember as  
              to   how   much   medicines   were   purchased   during   the   year  
              1985­86.   I   have   not   brought   the   said   record   today   in   the  
              court. I can not produce the same in the court because after  
              the   assessment   of   sale   tax   etc   such   record   can   not   be  
              maintained for such a long period. This suit pertains to the  
              period   01.04.1985   to   30.11.1985.   I   also   can   not   say   as   to  
              whether I can  produce the balance sheet, income tax return  
              or the sale tax record, for the said period or not. I can not  
              produce the account books for the said period, now since it is  
              very long."
</p>
<p id="p_29">             Thus, as per the plaintiff, plaintiff can not produce the records as it is an old 

record but the plaintiff is filing the suit for bills for the period between 01.04.1985 to 

30.11.1985 and suit has been filed in 1988. Therefore, prime burden is upon the plaintiff 

to maintain  the record and while considering the contentions, the date of institution of 

the suit has to be considered and not the date the evidence of the plaintiff. Therefore, 

plaintiff can not take plea that he is not in position to produce the relevant documents as 

the trial of the suit has taken a lot of time.
</p>
<p id="p_30">(i)           Further, plaintiff has not filed any balance sheet of income tax or sales tax 


Suit No. 677/10       M/s  Gogia Medicos Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation                   Page No. 22/26
 or any account book to show how the outstanding amount claimed by him in the suit is 

due as per the <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_4">Evidence Act</a>, the onus is upon the plaintiff to show how the outstanding 

amount is due by the defendants towards the plaintiff but the plaintiff has not filed any 

such account book.  Further, plaintiff has not produced any statement of accounts or bills 

in support of his contention of the outstanding amount. During cross examination, PW­1 

has admitted that 

                             "The   bills   were   issued   in   Duplicate.   I   do   not  
                have the duplicate copies of the bills. However, the originals  
                are with DTC. Since assessment had taken place long back,  
                I did not preserve the duplicate copies of the bills."
</p>
<p id="p_31">               Thus as per the admission of the plaintiff himself, one copy of the bill is to 

be with the plaintiff though the original has been sent to the defendants. Thus, it is clear 

that   the   plaintiff   is   presumed   to   have  the  best   evidence   within,  but  as   per  plaintiff, 

plaintiff has sent one notice U/o 12 R 8 CPC to produce the originals of the bills in the 

court but this can not held the plaintiff because in view of the above admission, as one 

copy has to be with the plaintiff and plaintiff has not come up with any plea that the 

copy which is required to be with the plaintiff has been destroyed or lost. In view of 

thereof,   it   can   be   said   that   plaintiff   has   failed   to   prove   any   of   the   circumstances 

mentioned in <a href="/doc/487818/" id="a_5">Section 65</a> of the Indian Evidence Act, so as to, permit the plaintiff to lead 

secondary   evidence.   Further,   even  in  the   legal   notices   which  are   Ex.   PW1/368,   Ex. 

PW1/373   and   Ex.   PW1/383,   the   plaintiff   has   not   mentioned   or   explained   how   the 

outstanding amount has been calculated by the plaintiff. Thus, plaintiff has completely 

failed to show how the plaintiff has made the calculation of the outstanding amount so as 

Suit No. 677/10          M/s  Gogia Medicos Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation                   Page No. 23/26
 to show that plaintiff' is entitled to relief of recovery of the suit amount. 

</p><p id="p_32">(j)          Further, letter dated 21.07.1986 and 09.12.1986 which are Mark A and B, 

show that in case of violation of the rules and regulations of the Medical Health Scheme, 

the payment of the bill will be stopped. Defendants have also averred that due to the 

misuse of the Medical Health Scheme by the defendant No. 1, the scheme was taken 

back and the bills raised after 31.03.1985 were with holding for examination of bills and 

an Scrutiny Committee was constituted to determine the genuineness of the bills and the 

bill was made only that the Scrutiny Committee passed the bills or has given decision 

that the bills are genuine. The defendants have stated  some of rules and regulations in 

the pleadings as well as in the evidence and during examination, as is recorded above. 

PW­1 has admitted a such rules and regulations. Now as per plaintiff, plaintiff has raised 

the bills as per rules and regulations, but during cross examination, PW­1 has admitted 

that

                               "It is correct that the bills containing in the Ex.  
</p><p id="p_33">              PW1/D2 (nine bundles) does not show the expiry date of  
              the medicines written thereon in the bills. It is correct that  
              as per office order No. 8 and 35, I was not supposed to give  
              the   bigger   packet   prescribed   by   the   doctor   in   the  
              prescription. It is correct that in prescription No. 358796  
              issued  by the doctor, four number of  the medicines were  
              prescribed   by   the   doctor   and   I   had   given   only   three  
              medicines as per bill No. 8673 dated 16.12.1984.  The said  
              bill   is   Ex.   PW1/D3.   Similarly,   in   the   prescription   No.  
              158098 four numbers of medicines were prescribed by the  
              doctor and I had issued only three medicines. The same is  
              also Ex. PW1/D3. The witness was shown the whole bundle  

Suit No. 677/10       M/s  Gogia Medicos Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation              Page No. 24/26
               Ex. PW1/D3 and the witness admits the same that the bills  
              issued   by   him   shows   the   incomplete   dispensing   of  
              medicines. It is correct that in the bills mentioned in bundle  
              Ex. PW1/D5 shows certain bills exceeding amount of Rs.  
</p><p id="p_34">              50/­,  The  said   fact  is also mentioned in  the list attached  
              with the said bundle Ex. PW1/D6 shows the discrepancies  
              in the bills with regard to no expiry date not admissible and  
              excess amount."
</p>
<p id="p_35">
             Thus, plaintiff has admitted that the bills shown by the defendants during 

cross examination of PW­1 were raised in violation of Rules and Regulations of the 

Scheme and thus defendants have   succeeded in establishing their stands and plaintiff 

has failed to show that the bills were rejected or payment was withhold without any 

reason. Though, defendants have failed to show whether any action was taken by the 

defendants against the plaintiff in violation of the Rules and Regulations and for misuse 

of the scheme but the same is not an issue in the present suit and moreover plaintiff can 

not take benefit of the defects in the stand of the defendants and the case of the plaintiff 

has to stand on its own. Therefore, it is clear that the plaintiff has failed to prove that he 

is entitled to recovery of any money and consequently no question of any interest arises. 

Accordingly,  the  issue  No. 2  and 3 are decided in favour of the defendants and 

against the plaintiff.

 been lead over the said issue nor any arguments have been addressed,  therefore the 

issue No. 1  is decided in favour of the plaintiff and against the defendants. 

</p><p id="p_38">9.           As the issue No. 2 and 3 have been decided in favour of the defendants and 

against the plaintiff, the suit is liable to be dismissed.    Accordingly, the suit of the 

plaintiff is dismissed as the plaintiff has failed to prove his own case.
