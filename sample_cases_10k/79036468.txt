                     This writ petition has been filed by the petitioner who is
       also one of the employees of Mineral Area Development Authority
       (MADA).     Petitioner's   contention   is that the   respondent no.     6,
       Shailendra Kumar Singh should not have been given the post of SDO,
       Water Supply Department and Assistant Engineer, Town Planning
       Department, MADA as he was not eligible for such posts and that the
       respondents should complete the enquiry which has been ordered by
       the Urban Development Department.
</p><p id="p_4">       2.            Mr. Abhay Prakash, learned counsel appearing for the
       State-respondents, while referring to the counter-affidavit filed on
       behalf of the Urban Development Department, submitted that though,
       respondent no. 6 is working as Assistant Engineer, Jharia Water
       Supply, MADA, Dhanbad, but, he was / is not eligible to hold such
 posts and the higher pay scale given to him was contrary to the
guidelines of the State Government and therefore, the Managing
Director, MADA was directed to hold inquiry and submit a report to the
Department, but the enquiry report was not found satisfactory and
MADA is not replying to the questions raised in the letter dated
28.12.2010 and is not cooperating in the enquiry. He further
submitted that further inquiry is needed regarding the allegations of
committing financial irregularities by respondent no. 6.
</p><p id="p_5">3.          On the other hand, Mr. Aparesh Kumar Singh, learned
counsel appearing for the MADA, defended the action of the MADA and
submitted that several public interest litigations / writ petitions were
filed by other employees raising similar pleas which were not
entertained by this court and were accordingly dismissed. He further
submitted that even then, MADA is agreeable to hold / cooperate in
any inquiry into the allegations made by the petitioner. He further
submitted that till the conclusion of the inquiry, respondent no. 6 will
be reverted back to his substantive post of Mechanical Chargeman,
Water Supply Division, Jharia which he was holding, though he was
given additional charge / post of SDO, Water Supply Department and
Assistant   Engineer,       Town    Planning    Department     in   view    of
administrative exigency and as per the decision of MADA.
</p><p id="p_6">4.          Mr. Rajiv Ranjan, learned counsel appearing for the
respondent no. 6, denied and disputed the allegations made against
his client by the petitioner.

allegations and several disputed question of facts, I am inclined to
