Appearing Counsel:

For the Petitioner(s): Mr. Baldev Singh, Advocate
For the Respondent(s): Mr. Asheesh Singh Kotwal, Advocate.</pre>

<p id="p_1">1.     These civil revisions have been filed against the order dated 25.04.2015
       passed by the learned Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Reasi in case titled
       Gulshama Begum and others vs. Bajaj Allianz General Insurance
       Company Limited and others, and in case titled Shafiqa Begum and
       another vs Bajaj Allianz General Isurance Company Limited and in case
       titled Tajo Begum and others vs. Bajaj Allianz General Insurance
       Company Limited and others whereby the applications of the petitioner for
       setting aside of the ex parte Awards dated 04.11.2013 &amp; 25.11.2013 have
       been dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_2">2.     Since common questions of law and facts arise for consideration in these
       petitions, they were heard analogously and are being decided by this
       common order.
</p>
<p id="p_3">3.     The facts leading to filing of these petitions briefly stated are that the
       impugned order is against the law, hence the same is liable to be set aside.
       The respondents /claimants           filed      claim petitions before the learned

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">C. Rev. No.25/2015 c/w C. Rev. Nos.29/2015 &amp; 30/2015                          Page 1 of 9</span>
        MACT, Reasi with regard to death of Sh. Abdul Rahim, Sh. Mushtaq
       Ahmed and Sh. Abdul Gaffar, who died in an accident on 14.10.2011. The
       appellant after receipt of notice of filing the claim petitions from the
       learned Tribunal had engaged the counsel namely Sh. Diwakar Sharma,
       Advocate as counsel who also filed the objections to the claim petitions.
       In the objections, in addition to other factual pleas, have taken a plea of
       validity of driving licence of the driver of the alleged offending vehicle
       which was commercial vehicle (TATA Sumo) but was possessing driving
       licence to drive Motorcycle with gear and LMV only. The learned
       counsel after filing the objections absented from the proceedings before the
       learned Tribunal as a result the ex parte order was passed against the
       appellant and on coming to know about the ex parte proceedings an
       application was filed through another counsel namely Mr. Akhil Prashev,
       Advocate for contesting the cases on behalf of the appellant company. The
       said application was allowed and the ex parte proceedings against the
       petitioner company were set aside. It is further stated that after engaging
       another counsel made communication to him through his mobile but he
       assured that the cases are going on well and the appellant-company will be
       provided the dates when the presence of its law officer was required for his
       statement in support of its defence. It was also brought to the notice of the
       learned counsel engaged through its communication with Investigation
       report that the driving licence of the driver of the offending vehicle is not
       valid for the purpose of driving of offending vehicle hence requested for
       taking appropriate steps for summoning of the witnesses so that the
       appellant-company be able to establish and prove the statutory defences. It
       is further stated that the counsel who was engaged by the appellant-
       company advised the officer/official of the appellant-company that as the
       matter of fact that the case is of civil nature hence their attendance is not
       required before the learned Tribunal and when their presence is required he
       will inform. But to the surprise of this appellant the counsel had neither

        informed nor responded any letters of the appellant nor took the defence as
       informed to him along with record. Hence the company is burdened with
       the liability to pay compensation by means of ex parte award although it
       had none. It is further stated that the Law Officer of the appellant company
       on coming to know of the ex parte award through Sh. Deepak Atri,
       Advocate who was appointed as counsel for the petitioner-company for
       contesting the cases of the company at Reasi as the earlier counsel engaged
       stopped coming to the Court at Reasi because of some domestic problems,
       as Mr. Atri received the notice in execution petition of the ex parte award
       from the learned Tribunal. He immediately informed the appellant company
       and applied for the certified copy of the award on the instructions of the
       appellant. Thereafter filed an application for setting aside of the ex parte
       award by highlighting the factual position supported with documents. The
       learned Tribunal invited the objections to the application filed by the
       appellant but has not given any chance to led any evidence in support of the
       application and fixed the case straight way for final arguments. The learned
       Tribunal without going into facts highlighted in the petition for setting
       aside the award passed, dismissed the same on the simple grounds that the
       domestic problems of the counsel engaged has not been highlighted and
       there will be injustice to widows and orphaned children who are eluded for
       the relief despite passing of ex parte order. The order impugned is bad in
       law and is passed without application of mind and the facts highlighted in
       the petition. It is further stated that the learned Tribunal's order is against
       the ratio laid down in the National Insurance Co. Ltd. Vs Gowramma
       (Decided on 25th April, 2013 in MFA No.6828 of 2009-Karnataka HC) &amp;
       in case titled Bajaj Allianz General Insurance v C.Rajagopal (Decided on
       11th October, 2012-Karnataka High Court), wherein it is held that an
       opportunity has to be given to the appellant to put-forth its contentions with
       regard to issuance of policy and liability of the appellant to indemnify or
       otherwise &amp; the tribunal ought to have verified after service of notice as to

       before it.

               for commercial vehicle-Passenger carrying as such the driver of the IV must
               possess PSV endorsement on DL. Herein, the driver does not have any PSV
               endorsement, was being plied the offending vehicle on public road. Hence the
               driver has violated the Driver Clause of the Policy terms &amp; conditions as well
               as <a href="/doc/152999974/" id="a_1">Section 149(2)</a> of the Motor Vehicle Act, 1988.

               offending vehicle respondent No.3 does not possess the valid &amp; effective
               driving licence at the time of accident. The accused does not have any PSV
               endorsement at the time of accident which is in violation of policy terms and
               conditions as well as Sec-149(2) of the <a href="/doc/785258/" id="a_2">Motor Vehicle Act</a> 1988. Hence,
               Insurance Company is not liable for any compensation.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">               f)       That the offending vehicle was being plied in the District Udhampur
               while the accident took place in District Reasi. However, as per the Permit
               verification report, the offending vehicle does not have any valid route permit
               to ply the vehicle in the district Reasi on the date of accident. Hence, the driver
               has violated the terms and conditions of the Policy as well as Sec-66 &amp; 149(2)
               of the <a href="/doc/785258/" id="a_3">MV Act</a>. Hence, on both the grounds the appellant Insurance Company
               is not liable to pay any compensation and absolve from all the liabilities.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_7">               g)    That the award amount is on higher side and failed to consider the

</p>
<p id="p_9">9.     I have given my thoughtful consideration to whole aspect of the matter.

<p id="p_10">10.    From the perusal of record, it reveals that four claims petition arising out of
       same accident, which took place on 14.10.2011 due to rash and negligent
       diving of driver of offending vehicle Tata Sumo JK14-B5340 at Shadole
       falling under jurisdiction P/S Mahore, were filed for grant of compensation.
       In this accident, four persons namely Mushtaq Ahmed, Abdul Gaffar and
       Abdul Rahim died. Their legal heirs filed claim petitions and one injured
       Javaid Ahmed also filed claim petition on account of injuries sustained by
       him. Petitioner herein was arrayed as insurance company along with owner
       and diver; company appeared and filed objections through Advocate
       Diwaker Sharma on 18.4.013; other respondents also filed objections.
       Advocate of company thereafter did not appear and so ex-parte proceeding
       were initiated against company. Finally on 4.11.2013 and 25.11.2013 court


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">C. Rev. No.25/2015 c/w C. Rev. Nos.29/2015 &amp; 30/2015                            Page 5 of 9</span>
        below (MACT Reasi) passed award in all claims petitions against company.
       Thereafter, execution petitions were filed and notice was issued to
       company. The company then filed applications for setting aside ex-parte
       awards; in the applications it has been stated that company engaged a
       counsel, who filed objections but due to domestic problem the counsel
       could not appear in court with the result ex-parte proceedings were initiated
       and thereafter awards were passed. That company has not been given any
       opportunity of being heard. That a specific stand was taken that driver of
       the offending vehicle was not having valid licence. That it was only on
       26.5.2014, the company came to know about awards, when counsel for
       applicant received notice of execution of award. That immediately
       thereafter certified copy of award was applied.
</p>
<p id="p_11">11.    Other side filed objections stating that Advocate Diwaker Sharma
       appeared for company and filed vakalatnama, then absented and ex-parte
       proceeding was initiated, then it was set aside and advocate for company
       filed objections on 18.4.2013 . Thereafter again wilfully absented.
</p>
<p id="p_12">12.    Court below after hearing the parties, dismissed all the applications for
       setting aside ex-parte awards on the ground that due to domestic problem
       Advocate for company could not appear, but what was domestic problem
       has not been pleaded; court below further held that proceeding remained
       pending for two years, so reason mentioned are not plausible, but sheer
       negligence on part of company and counsel.
</p>
<p id="p_13">13.    Law with regard to setting aside ex-parte decree/order is settled. The
       period for filing application for setting aside ex-parte decree/order is 30
       days from date of decree, when party is prosecuting the case, as is evident

<p id="p_15">15.    <a href="/doc/100581/" id="a_13">Section 5</a> of Limitation Act reads as under:-

<blockquote id="blockquote_11">              "5. Extension of period in certain cases

              An appeal or an application for a review of a judgment or for leave to
              appeal or an application to set aside an order of dismissal of a suit for
              plaintiff's default or an application to set aside a decree passed ex-parte in
              an original suit or appeal or an application to bring the heirs of a deceased
              party on the record or an application to set aside an order of abatement of a
              suit or appeal or any other application to which this section may be made
              applicable by or under an enactment for the time being in force may be
              admitted after the period of limitation prescribed therefore, when the

<p id="p_16">16.    From the bare perusal of this section, it is evident that court can condone
       the delay in filing application for setting aside ex-parte decree, if applicant
       satisfies the court that he was having sufficient cause due to which he could
       not file application within prescribed period of limitation. Sufficient cause
       means cause, which court thinks adequate and beyond control of person
       seeking benefit of <a href="/doc/1542963/" id="a_14">section 5</a> of limitation act.
</p><p id="p_17">17.    Now law is settled that each and every days after expiry of limitation
       period, have to be explained by party seeking condonation of delay, after
       the limitation period is over. This delay has to be explained by cogent
       reasons.

       his counsel to defend the claim petition, but subsequently counsel neither
       appeared before the MACT nor informed company about the status of the
       claim petition, is neither tenable nor a plausible explanation. As is evident
       from the impugned order, the claimants are unfortunate legal heirs of

        deceased persons, claimed the damages on account of death of their only
       earning members. The petitioner- company was duly served and initially
       represented by his counsel. Subsequently, as nobody appeared on their
       behalf, therefore, ex parte proceedings were ordered against them. The
       application for setting aside the ex parte award was dismissed by the
       MACT. Order 9 Rule 13 CPC postulates that in any case, in which, a
       decree is passed ex parte against a defendant, he may apply to the Court by
       which the decree was passed for an order to set it aside; and if he satisfies
       the Court that the summons was not duly served, or that he was prevented
       by any sufficient cause from appearing when the suit was called on for
       hearing, the Court shall make an order setting aside the decree as against
       him upon such terms as to costs, payment into Court or otherwise as it
       thinks fit, and shall appoint a day for proceeding with the suit. What cannot
       possibly be disputed that in the instant case, the company was duly served.
       Company has miserably failed to prove they were prevented by sufficient
       cause from appearing in Court, which is a condition precedent for setting
       aside the ex parte award. The ex parte awards were passed on 4.11.2013
       and 25.11.2013; whereas the applications for setting aside the same were
       filed on 14.6.2014, that too, without an application for condonation of
       delay.
</p><p id="p_19">19.    From the grounds mentioned in applications for setting aside ex-parte
       awards, it is therefore apparent that these are after thought and have been
       cleverly been drafted, thereby creating illusion of knowledge. This is not
       permissible under law. Law of limitation has to be applied with its entire
       rigour, if party fails to demonstrate sufficient cause, otherwise very purpose
       of limitation act will be rendered inconsequential. Speedy trial especially
       under <a href="/doc/785258/" id="a_15">M.V. Act</a> is fundamental rights of every person. Liberal approach
       does not mean company shall be considered better footing than ordinary
       litigants, while considering the application for setting aside ex-parte decree.
       Therefore, the MACT has correctly dismissed the applications of petitioner
