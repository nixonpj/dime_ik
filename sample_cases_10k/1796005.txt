:COMMON ORDER      


</pre><p id="p_3">        The petitioner has filed WP No.  4844 of 2001 praying for  a  Writ  of
Mandamus  forbearing  the respondents 2 and 3 from issuing LPG Distributorship
for HP Gas in Tharamangalam locality, Salem District in open (women)  category
list to the fourth respondent which was called and advertised on 28.08.2000 by
the second respondent without following the usual and normal procedures.
</p>
<p id="p_4">        2.      The prayer  in  WP  No.    11066  of  2001  is  for  a Writ of
Certiorarified Mandamus to call for the records from the respondents 1 to 3 in
respect of the file relating to issue of LPG Distributorship  for  HP  Gas  in
Tharamangalam locality, Salem District in open (women) category list which was
called and advertised on 28.08.2000 and quash the impugned order passed by the 
third  respondent herein by order dated 22.11.2 000 relating to the above said
subject matter and grant the same distributorship to the petitioner herein.
</p><p id="p_5">        3.      The case of the petitioner is as follows:-
</p><p id="p_6">        The second respondent/Petroleum Corporation, hereinafter  referred  to
as   'corporation',   has   issued   notification  dated  19.05.1998  inviting
applications for award of LPG Distributorship of HPC Gas for  seven  locations
under  various  categories  and  the  petitioner submitted her application for
allotment  of  Distributorship  under   open   (women)   category   list   for
Tharamangalam, Salem  District.   Thereafter, the corporation did not take any
steps for two years and issued another notification dated 28.08.2000  and  the
petitioner submitted  another  application  on  09.10.2000.   According to the
petitioner, she is financially sound and experienced in explosive materials as
well  as  transport,  owns  lands  suitable  for  construction  of  godown  at
Taramangalam thereby satisfied the qualifications required by the Corporation.
On  01.11.2000, the third respondent sent a letter calling upon the petitioner
to attend  an  interview  on  22.11.2000  and  accordingly  she  attended  the
interview  and the third respondent selected the petitioner, fourth respondent
and one M.  Kamalakanna.  Thereafter,  the  petitioner  did  not  receive  any
communication  from  the  third  respondent,  hence,  she  sent a letter dated
10.02.2001 requesting the third respondent to award the LPG distributorship in
her favour.  On 17.02.2001, the corporation sent  a  reply  stating  that  the
selection  for  the  LPG dealership is completed and letter of intent was also
issued to the fourth respondent.  Immediately, the petitioner sent a letter on
19.12.2001 to the third respondent requesting to give the order of  rejection,
for which, the third respondent has sent a reply dated 28.02.2001 stating that
after   publication   of   merit   list,   no  correspondence,  whatsoever  is
entertainable.  According to the  petitioner,  for  the  purpose  of  awarding
dealership,  the  respondents  2  and  3  herein ought to have conducted field
survey for all the candidates, but conducted only in  respect  of  the  fourth
respondent ignoring the usual procedure.
</p>
<p id="p_7">        4.      The  corporation  has  filed  a  counter affidavit denying the
averments made by the petitioner as mentioned below:-
</p><p id="p_8">        Originally, the Corporation has issued a  notification  on  19.05.1998
and  in  response  to the same various applications were received, scrutinised
and submitted to the third respondent for conducting interviews, however,  the
selection  process  for new dealership was kept in abeyance by the Ministry of
Petroleum and Natural Gas.   Again,  as  per  the  directions  issued  by  the
Ministry, notification  was  issued  on  28.08.2000.    The  third  respondent
conducted interview and selected three candidates including the petitioner and
fourth respondent and as per the directions issued by  the  third  respondent,
field  investigation  report  in respect of the candidate placed number one in
the merit panel, namely the fourth respondent, was  conducted  and  submitted.
The  third  respondent further directed to issue letter of intent in favour of
the candidate placed number one in the merit  panel,  if  found  suitable  and
accordingly dealership was awarded in favour of the fourth respondent.  In any
event,  financial  soundness/capability  alone not the criterion for selection
and placing a candidate in No.1 in the merit panel.  The field  inspection  is
done  only  for  the first empanelled candidate for the first instance in line
with the revised dealership selection procedure formulated  by  the  ministry.
It  is  not incumbent for the third respondent to communicate the final result
of the dealership selections to all the  candidates.    The  third  respondent
found  that  the eligibility, status and field inspection report in respect of
the fourth respondent was satisfactory, hence,  issued  letter  of  intent  in

favour of  the  fourth  respondent.    The corporation has followed guidelines
issued by the Ministry and there is  no  illegality  or  irregularity  in  the
selection of the fourth respondent.
</p>
<p id="p_9">        5.      The  third  respondent has filed counter stating that there is
no omission or commission in the selection of the candidates as alleged by the
petitioner and  the  selection  was  made  in  accordance  with  law  and  the
guidelines  issued  by  the  Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, New Delhi,
periodically.
</p>
<p id="p_10">        6.      The  selected  candidate,  fourth  respondent  has  filed  the
counter affidavit wherein it is stated thus:-
</p><p id="p_11">        The  allegation  that  the  petitioner  is  financially  sound and has
experience in the field of explosives and transportation and that she  possess
land suitable for construction of godown are all false.  The averment that the
petitioner   is   the   only  candidate  fully  qualified  for  the  award  of
distributorship is untrue and misleading.   The  fourth  respondent  is  fully
qualified  and  is  possessing  land and show room in Tharamangalam as well as
sound financial stability than that of the petitioner.  The third  respondent,
after having satisfied with the eligibility and financial status of the fourth
respondent has  finally  selected  her  and awarded the dealership.  It is not
necessary for the respondents 2 and 3 to conduct field survey  in  respect  of
all the  candidates who were selected.  Pursuant to the award of dealership on
10.01.2001, as required, the fourth respondent has arranged for a show room at
Tharamangalam with telephone, constructed godown at a cost of Rs.2 lakhs etc.,
The Chief Controller of Explosives, Department of  Explosives,  Government  of
India  Chennai,  after  satisfied  with  the construction of the godown issued
licence in Form F for storage of LPG Cylinders under Gas Cylinder Rules, 1981.
She has also obtained certificate of registration  under  Tamil  Nadu  General
Sales  Tax  Act  and the <a href="/doc/1645178/" id="a_3">Central Sales Tax Act</a> from 20.03.2001 under TNGST Rc. 
No.  3243325 and CST Rc.No.677407 respectively.  The  fourth  respondent  also
deposited  a  sum  of Rs.22,500/- with the second respondent in respect of 450
cylinders.  The fourth respondent has  spent  huge  amount  towards  acquiring
land,  construction  of  godown,  setting  up  show  room, acquiring transport
vehicles,  employing  technical  men,  getting  registration  certificates,  F
licence  from  Controller  of  Explosives  etc., but because of the injunction
granted by this Court, she was put to irreparable loss and hardship and  could
not commence the dealership business.  
</p>
<p id="p_12">        7.      Mr.  S.C.   Palanisamy, learned counsel appearing for the writ
petitioner reiterated the contents of the affidavit filed in  support  of  the
writ  petition  and  stated that the respondents 1 to 3 have failed to compare
the merits and demerits of the petitioner and  the  fourth  respondent  before
awarding the distributorship; that the higher merits and qualifications of the
petitioner  was  not  properly  considered;  the  respondents 1 to 3 failed to
follow the procedures and formalities before selecting the fourth  respondent;
that  the  respondents 1 to 3 failed to conduct field survey report in respect
of the petitioner.  The learned counsel for  the  petitioner  highlighted  the
argument  that  the  respondents 1 to 3 in their notification dated 28.08.2000
mentioned that applicant should furnish along with the application the details
of land for godown  with  measurement,  whereas,  in  this  case,  the  fourth
respondent has not furnished the said details.  In support of this contention,
the  learned  counsel  for the petitioner relied on the decision of a Division
Bench of this Court reported in (<a href="/doc/1616887/" id="a_4">K.  Vinodkumar  v.    I.S.    Palanisamy  and
others</a>)  2003  Writ  Law  Reporter  476,  wherein in para-8 and 11 it was held
thus:-
</p>
<p id="p_13">        "8.     The last limb of the clause has been taken by Mr.  Subramanian
for his aid to contend that the land has to be offered within two months  from
the date of grant of distributorship, which provides that, if the selectee has
not  offered  the land, the particulars of which had already been given within
two months, the dealership granted would be cancelled.  This  would  mean,  if
the  selectee is not able to make available the land which has been considered
more suitable on evaluation by the Corporation on the commercial point of view
within two months from selection, the dealership  granted  in  favour  of  the
selectee would  be  cancelled.   This exercise of consideration of the land by
the Corporation has to be done prior to selection.  Hence, the details of  the
land  should  be made known to the corporation well in advance so as to enable
the corporation to evaluate prior to selection.  Hence the  contention  contra
to the same by  Mr.   R.  Subramanian has to be rejected.  Even in this clause
also, there is a reference to the land, the details of which has already  been
furnished.  Hence, a cojoint reading of the four limbs of the clause (v) would
make  it clear that the applicant has to furnish the details of the land along
with the application.
</p><p id="p_14">        11.     Each case depends on  its  own  facts.    A  close  similarity
between  one  case and another is not enough because even a single significant
detail may alter the entire aspect.  It is well settled that in deciding  such
cases,  one should avoid the temptation to decide cases by matching the colour
of one case against the colour of another.  To  decide,  therefore,  on  which
side of the line a case falls, the broad resemblance to another case is not at
all decisive.    A  single  additional  or  different fact may make a ocean of
difference between conclusions in two cases."
</p>
<p id="p_15">        8.      The learned counsel appearing for  the  corporation  submitted
that  field  inspection  has been done only in respect of the first empanelled
candidate namely the fourth respondent, in line with  the  revised  dealership
selection  procedure  formulated  by  the  ministry  and as per the directions
issued by the third respondent; that as per the guidelines, if  the  candidate
in  the merit panel No.1 is not found suitable for any reason, a report has to
be forwarded to the Chairman of the selection Board, so, it is  crystal  clear
that  the  intention of the third respondent is to conduct field investigation
only in respect of the first merit candidate; that there is no  illegality  or
irregularity  in  the  selection process and the corporation has complied with
all the formalities before awarding  the  distributorship  in  favour  of  the
fourth respondent.  The averment that details of land for godown not furnished
by  the fourth respondent along with the application is concerned, the same is
not mentioned in the affidavit, hence, the  corporation  has  not  been  given
opportunity  to meet the said grounds, however, the said averment is false and
prayed for dismissal of the writ petitions.
</p>
<p id="p_16">        9.      The learned counsel appearing for the third respondent submits
that the petitioner's superior claim over others in the matter of selection is
untenable; that the allegation that there was a final selection in  which  the
fourth  respondent  was  selected as No.1 is not substantially correct, on the
other hand, there was only one selection and this was  immediately  after  the
conclusion  of  the  interview  and  in this selection three candidates in the
order of merit would be made on assessing the performance  of  the  candidates
who  appeared  for  the  interview  and also based upon the documents filed by
them; that the selection would be made by the third  respondent  by  allotting
marks  to  each and every candidate on their merit and the highest scorer will
be the first; that as per the guidelines, shortlist was notified in the notice
board in alphabetical order and later, as  per  the  revised  guidelines,  the
notification  of shortlist was dropped and only the merit list in the order of
merit alone is being notified in the notice board;  that  in  any  event,  the
selection  of  the  fourth  respondent was made in accordance with law and the
guidelines issued periodically by the ministry of Petroleum and  Natural  Gas,
New Delhi and prayed for dismissal of the writ petitions.
</p>
<p id="p_17">        10.     The  learned  counsel  appearing  for  the  fourth  respondent
submits that the allegation that the petitioner is financially sound  and  has
experience  in the field of explosives and transportation and that she possess
land suitable for construction of  godown  are  all  false;  that  the  fourth
respondent  is  fully  qualified  and  is  possessing  land  and  show room in
Tharamangalam  as  well  as  sound  financial  stability  than  that  of   the
petitioner;  that  the  details  of  the  same  were  furnished  by the fourth
respondent along with the application; that the third respondent, after having
satisfied with the eligibility and financial status has finally  selected  the
fourth  respondent  and  awarded  the dealership in her favour; that it is not
necessary for the respondents 2 and 3 to conduct field survey  in  respect  of
all the candidates who were selected; that pursuant to the award of dealership


on  10.01.2001,  the  fourth  respondent  has  complied with all the statutory
requirements; that the petitioner is not entitled to the relief sought for  in
the writ petitions and prayed for dismissal of the same.
</p>
<p id="p_18">        11.     The  learned  counsel  appearing  for  the respondents 2 and 3
relied on the below mentioned decisions:-
</p>
<p id="p_19">                (<a href="/doc/952082/" id="a_5">Raunaq International Ltd.  v.  I.V.R.    Construction  Ltd</a>.,)
(1999) 1  SCC  492,  wherein  in  Para Nos.  10 and 18, the Honourable Supreme
Court held thus:-
</p>
<p id="p_20">        "10.  When a writ petition is filed in the High Court challenging  the
award  of  a  contract  by  a public authority or the State, the court must be
satisfied  that  there  is  some  element  of  public  interest  involved   in
entertaining such  a petition.  If, for example, the dispute is purely between
two tenderers, the court must be very careful to see if there is  any  element
of public  interest  involved  in  the  litigation.   A mere difference in the
prices offered by the two tenderers may or may not  be  decisive  in  deciding
whether  any  public  interest is involved in intervening in such a commercial
transaction.  It is important to bear in mind that by court intervention,  the
proposed project may be considerably delayed thus escalating the cost far more
than  any  saving  which  the court would ultimately effect in public money by
deciding the dispute  in  favour  of  one  tenderer  or  the  other  tenderer.
Therefore, unless the court is satisfied that there is a substantial amount of
public  interest,  or  the  transaction  is  entered into mala fide, the court
should  not  intervene  under  <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_6">Article  226</a>  in  disputes  between  two  rival
tenderers.
</p>
<p id="p_21">        18.   A  somewhat  different  approach may be required in the cases of
award of a contract by the Government for the purchase of items for  its  use.
Judicial  review would be permissible only on the established grounds for such
review  including  mala  fides,  arbitrariness  or  unreasonableness  of   the
Wednesbury variety.    Balance  of  convenience  would  play  a  major role in
moulding interim relief.
</p>
<p id="p_22">        12.     The  second  respondent/corporation  has  issued  notification
dated  19.05.1998  inviting  applications  to  grant  LPG  distributorship for
Hindustan Petroleum Gas in  Taramangalam  locality,  Salem  District  in  Open
(Women) Category  list.   After receipt of applications, selection process for
new dealership was kept in abeyance by the Ministry of Petroleum  and  Natural
Gas.   Again,  after  clearance  from the Ministry, notification was issued on
28.08.2000, applications were received and processed.   The  third  respondent
conducted interview and selected three candidates including the petitioner, in
which, the  fourth  respondent  herein  was  first  among them.  The selection
process was made by allotting marks to each  and  every  candidates  on  their
merit and the highest scorer will be the first.
</p>
<p id="p_23">        13.     Considering  the facts and circumstance of the case, it is not
proper for this Court to go deep into the records of the Board or  Corporation
and  to  examine  the validity of the rival claims upon appreciation afresh of
the materials on such record and, on the basis of such re-appraisal, to decide
whether the selection was properly made or not.  In this context, it would  be
relevant  to  look  into the decision of a Division Bench of the Calcutta High
Court reported in (Chinmoy Sarkar and etc., vs.   Md.    Shaniat  Hossain  and
etc.,) AIR 1990 Calcutta 4 12 wherein in para-4 it was held thus:-
</p>
<p id="p_24">        "4.     Now,  it  must be pointed out at the outset that this Court in
Writ Jurisdiction cannot sit in appeal over the selection of a  Dealer  for  a
Retail Outlet  made  by  the  Board.   True, the Corporation and the Board are
amenable to the Writ Jurisdiction since they are "State" within the meaning of
<a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_7">Article 12</a> and also "authority" or "person" within the meaning of <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_8">Article 226</a>,
and what is involved in the selection for Retail  Dealership  of  articles  of
monopoly business  carried  on by a wholly-owned Government Company.  However,   
the exercise of such jurisdiction  and  the  judicial  reviewability  of  such
selection are subject to well-known limitations.  If the selection is vitiated
by  a arbitrary or irrational exercise of power or by malafides or is based on
no materials or made on the basis  of  irrelevant  materials  or  by  ignoring
relevant  factors  including  eligibility, the Writ Court would and should, on
proof of the relevant facts, grant an appropriate relief.  However, it is  not
for  the  Writ  Court  to  delve  deep  into  the  records of the Board or the
Corporation and to examine the validity of the rival claims upon  appreciation
afresh of the materials on such record and, on the basis of such re-appraisal,
to  decide  whether the selection was properly made and to give effect to such
decision by the issue of a Writ.  It cannot be overlooked in  this  connection
that  the  Board,  which  is  vested  with  the  function  of selection, is an
independent entity.  It is a high level body  consisting  of  a  retired  High
Court Judge  and  a retired Civil Servant.  Ordinarily, there would be minimal
scope for alleging malafides against such a body although it  can  conceivably
be  alleged  and  proved  in  a  given  case  that the selection made by it is
otherwise vitiated."
</p>
<p id="p_25">        14.     In this case, the  third  respondent,  after  considering  the
materials on record, personal assessment on merits, business ability, capacity
etc.,  of the applicant has prepared a panel according to their merits, hence,
judicial review would be permissible only  on  the  established  grounds  like
malafide, arbitrariness  or unreasonableness.  In this case, I do not find any
such grounds.  In the absence of such grounds and the  fact  that  the  Board,
which  is  vested  with  the  functions of selection, is an independent entity
consisting of retired Judges and retired Civil Servants  possessing  necessary
expertise and experience to perform their duty properly, there is only minimal
scope for  alleging  malafide  against  such a body.  As mentioned above, such
elements  like  malafide,  arbitrariness   and   unreasonableness   were   not
effectively canvassed and proved by the petitioner.  In this context, it would
be  useful to refer the decision of a Division Bench of this Court reported in
(<a href="/doc/923930/" id="a_9">V.  Chandran vs.  Oil Selection Board, Tamil Nadu,  Pondicherry  and  Andaman
and Nicobar Islands, Madras and others</a>) AIR 1996 Madras 87 wherein in para-14,
it was held thus:-
</p>
<p id="p_26">        "14.    As  already  seen,  the first respondent Board is a high level
body consisting  of  a  retired  Judge  of  this  Court,  one  retired  Deputy
Accountant  General and former member and acting Chairman of Tamil Nadu Public  
Service Commission and another respectable  person.    The  first  respondent,
after  considering  the  materials  on  record  and the personal assessment on
merits, business ability, capacity etc., of the  applicants,  has  prepared  a
panel  according  to  their  merits and granted the distributorship to the 4th
respondent by the Letter  of  Indent  dated  2  9.03.1994.    The  process  or
appreciating  and weighing the various factors, materials and rival merits, is
the function of the 1st  respondent  Board,  which  is  having  the  necessary
expertise and  experience  to perform its duties properly.  In our view, there
cannot therefore be any re-appreciation or re-appraisal of  relevant  material
factors,  relative  qualifications and evaluation of the comparative merits of
the candidates in a writ proceeding under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_10">Art.  226</a>  of  the  Constitution  of
India."
</p>
<p id="p_27">        15.     It  is  to be remembered that when two parties are challenging
the award of distributorship, the Court must be satisfied that there  is  some
element  of  public  interest  involved  in  entertaining  such  petition,  as
mentioned in the decision of the Honourable Supreme Court reported in  (<a href="/doc/952082/" id="a_11">Raunaq
International Ltd.  v.    I.V.R.  Construction Ltd</a>.,) (1999 ) 1 SCC 492, cited
supra.  In this case, I do not find any such public interest involved.
</p>
<p id="p_28">        16.     An argument was  advanced  by  the  learned  counsel  for  the
petitioner  surprisingly  that  the  fourth  respondent  has  not included the
particulars of lands along with the application, which is mandatory as per the
notification, but the same was not raised in the affidavit filed in support of
the writ petition, as pointed out by the learned counsel for the  corporation,
besides,  the  learned counsel for the corporation denied the said averment as
false.  In view of the same, the argument  of  the  learned  counsel  for  the
petitioner in that aspect is rejected.
</p>


<p id="p_29">        17.     The  other  argument of the learned counsel for the petitioner
that the respondents 1 to 3 have not made field inspection in respect  of  the
lands of the petitioner, who was in the third place in the panel is concerned,
the  respondents/Board  have  rightly  replied  that  field  inspection of the
person, who is number one in the merit list is sufficient and in case, if  the
same  is  found  not fit and if it is warranted, field inspection of the other
candidates will be conducted, hence, the said argument of the learned  counsel
for the petitioner is also rejected.
</p>
<p id="p_30">        18.     It  is  seen  from  the records that the fourth respondent has
provided lands, building and  other  amenities  to  the  satisfaction  of  the
respondents  1  to  3,  which  was  also  duly  inspected  by  the authorities
concerned, hence, this Court is of the considered view that the respondents  1
to  3  have  rightly  awarded  the  distributorship  in  favour  of the fourth
respondent and I do not find any illegality or infirmity in the same.
</p>
<p id="p_31">        19.     In view of  the  above  discussion,  the  writ  petitions  are
dismissed.  No costs.  Consequently, connected WPMPs are closed.
