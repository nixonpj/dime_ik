In case of his absence, without sufficient cause, the trial court may proceed against him under <a href="/doc/77781517/" id="a_9">Section 229-A</a> of the Indian Penal Code. 
</p>

If in the opinion of the trial court absence of the applicant is deliberate or without sufficient cause, then it shall be open for the trial court to treat such default as abuse of liberty of bail and proceed against him in accordance with law.
