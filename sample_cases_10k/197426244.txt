 2                Briefly stated, it is the case of the prosecution that the 

</pre><p id="p_2"> appellant / accused and injured PW5 Vinod Yadav were friends. 

 The appellant / accused  used to reside in the vicinity of the flour 

 mill where injured PW5 Vinod Yadav was working.  The incident 

 allegedly took place on 31st December 2008 at about 4 p.m. in the 

 house located at Galli No.15, Shri Sai Dalit Seva Samiti, Andheri. 

 As  the   appellant   / accused Ujwal Paris and injured PW5 Vinod 

 Yadav were friends, on that day, they indulged in a booze session. 

 During  the   course  of  drinking liquor,  injured  PW5 Vinod  Yadav 

 questioned the appellant / accused  Ujwal Paris as to why he had 

 beaten   his   parents   prior   to   two   or   three   days.     Upon   that,   the 

 appellant / accused   Ujwal Paris started quarreling with injured 

 Vinod Yadav.   During the course of that quarrel, the appellant / 

 accused   Ujwal   Paris   took   one   spade   from   the   bathroom   of   the 

 house and gave blow thereof on head of injured PW5 Vinod Yadav. 

 Because   of   that   blow,   injured   Vinod   Yadav   sustained   bleeding 

 injury and he was taken to Cooper hospital by his brother.

 indicated in the opening paragraph of the judgment.



 8                I have heard Ms.Nasreen Ayubi, the learned advocate 

 appearing   for   the   appellant   /   accused.   She   vehemently   argued 

 that   evidence   of  PW5 Vinod Yadav goes to show that  he  along 

 with the appellant / accused had consumed lot of liquor on the 

 day of the incident and there was quarrel between them.  With the 

 aid   of   material   elicited   from   cross-examination   of   PW5   Vinod 

 Yadav, Ms.Nasreen Ayubi, the learned advocate appearing for the 

 appellant / accused argued that the appellant / accused cannot be 

 said   to   be   the   author   of   injuries   suffered   by   the   injured   Vinod 

 Yadav.   She further argued that panch witness PW2   Kisan Babu 

 Pawar has turned hostile and even the injured had not identified 

 the weapon of the offence.  According to the learned advocate for 

 the appellant / accused, evidence of PW3  Raju Gautam cannot be 

 relied upon because he has admitted in cross-examination that he

 had signed one blank paper.  This witness has also admitted that 

 the paper in which clothes of the injured were wrapped was not 

 produced   before   the   court.     With   this,   the   learned   advocate 

 submitted that  the  impugned judgment and order of conviction 

 cannot be sustained.
</p>
<p id="p_7">

 9                The   learned   APP   supported   the   impugned   judgment 

 and order of conviction of the appellant / accused  for the offence 

 punishable under <a href="/doc/1540253/" id="a_6">Section 326</a> of the Indian Penal Code.  



 10               I have carefully considered the rival submissions and 

 also   perused   record   and   proceedings   including   oral   as   well   as 

 documentary evidence adduced by the prosecution.  The appellant 

 /  accused    has  been convicted of the offence punishable  under 

 <a href="/doc/1540253/" id="a_7">Section   326</a>   of  the   IPC  for voluntarily causing  grievous hurt   to 

 PW5 Vinod Yadav by means of a dangerous weapon i.e. a spade.

 11               PW5 Vinod Yadav is an injured witness.   The case in 

</pre><p id="p_9"> hand is that of a sole accused.   After the incident of assault on 

 him, PW5 Vinod Yadav was admitted at Cooper hospital, Mumbai, 

 where PW6 Dr.Saifulla had treated him.   As per version of PW6 

 Dr.Saifulla, upon medical examination of PW5 Vinod Yadav on 31 st 

 December 2008, he noticed the following injuries on head of PW5 

 Vinod Yadav :-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">                         1.        CLW admeasuring 8 x 6 cm on left occipital 

                         area   extending   into   the   neck   caused   by   sharp 

                         object.

                         the injuries were fresh.

<p id="p_10"> As   seen   from   evidence   of   PW6   Dr.Saifulla,   the   injured   was 

 subjected   to   City   Scan   and   PW6   Dr.Saifulla   deposed   that   after 

 perusal of the report of the City Scan, it was revealed that injured 

 PW5   Vinod   Yadav   had   suffered   fracture   of   right   occipital   bone 

 extending anteriorly to the right side mastoid.   Evidence of PW6 

 Dr.Saifulla is duly corroborated by contemporaneous documentary

 evidence produced on record by the prosecution at Exhibit 17 and 

 Exhibit 18.  The report of City Scan of bone of PW5 Vinod Yadav 

 reveals   that   he   had   suffered   undisplaced   fracture   of   the   right 

 occipital   bone.     As   such,   the   prosecution   has   established   that 

 injured PW5 Vinod Yadav had suffered fracture injury to his head.



 12               Now   let   us   examine   whether   the   prosecution   has 

 established that it was the appellant / accused who was the author 

 of the fracture injury to head of PW5 Vinod Yadav.    Injured PW5 

 Vinod Yadav has stated that while he and the appellant / accused 

 were drinking liquor, he questioned the appellant / accused  as the 

 appellant / accused   had earlier beaten his own parents.   Upon 

 that, as seen from evidence of PW5 Vinod Yadav, the appellant / 

 accused started quarreling with him, took out a spade and gave 

 blow   thereof   on   his   head   causing   bleeding   injury.       There   is 

 nothing   in   cross-examination   of   injured   PW5   Vinod   Yadav   to 

 disbelieve his version.  Suggestions that he suffered injury because 

 of   his   fall   under   intoxication   is   categorically   denied   by   this 

 witness.   As such, there is no reason to disbelieve version of the 


 avk                                                                         8/10

 and the author of the injury.

<p id="p_11">

 13               Evidence   of   Investigating   Officer   PW7   Sarla   Vasave, 

 A.P.I.,   shows  that  she   had seized  the   weapon   of  the   offence   by 

 preparing   panchnama.   No   doubt,   panch   witness   to   this   seizure 

 panchnama namely PW2 Kisan Babu Pawar has turned hostile, but 

 there  is  nothing  in cross-examination of Investigating Officer to 

 doubt seizure of the spade from the spot by her. The seized spade 

 was   duly   identified   by   the   injured   while   in   the   witness   box. 

 Though the handle of the spade was found missing, nothing boils 

 on that.
