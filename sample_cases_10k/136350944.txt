<p id="p_1">2   25.03.2009            Heard learned counsel for the petitioners and Mr.

                 R.P.S. Singh, Addl. P.P. appearing for the State.

</p><p id="p_2">                          The offence alleged is under <a href="/doc/1985627/" id="a_1">section 467</a> of the Indian

                 Penal Code.
</p>
<p id="p_3">                          Allegation against the petitioners, who are the owner

                 of the cold storage, had kept the potatoes of the complainant

                 and thereafter sold out the same, and as a result of which, the

                 complainant sustained severe loss.
</p>
<p id="p_4">                          It has been submitted on behalf of the petitioners

                 that in the cold storage as per the terms the Potatoes were to

                 be kept only up to the month of October and thereafter the

                 cold storage was to be kept closed. The complainant under the

                 terms was required to receive the Potatoes, however despite

                 notice he did not receive the same and thereafter Potatoes were

                 sold out in the market. It is further submitted that the

                 complainant has initiated proceeding under the <a href="/doc/1733066/" id="a_2">Consumer

                 Protection Act</a> and in the said proceeding as directed by the

                 forum the petitioner deposited Rs. 1,50,000/- and presently
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                -2-</span>




           the matter is pending before the Hon'ble Supreme Court. As

           per the order contained in Annexure-3 to the supplementary

           affidavit filed   today   the   complainant was    permitted   to

           withdraw the amount on furnishing security to the satisfaction

           of the district forum.
</p>
<p id="p_5">                    Learned counsel for the complainant has appeared by

           filing Vakalatnama. He opposes the prayer for bail and

           submits that the petitioner in fact sold away the Potatoes on

           throw away price. He submits that the printed terms

           mentioned in the contract can not be given effect to, as a

           matter of fact, the petitioner ought to have taken the consent

           of the complainant before selling the same.

</p><p id="p_6">                    Learned counsel appearing for the State submits that

           the matter is pending with regard to the said transaction

           before the consumer Court.

           directed that in the event of arrest or surrender within a period

           of four weeks from today, the petitioners, above named, be

           released on bail on furnishing bail bonds of Rs. 10,000/- (ten

           thousand) with two sureties of the like amount each to the

           satisfaction of the Judicial Magistrate, Ist Class, Nalanda at
