<p id="p_1">    All these writ petitions raise a common issue and

are being disposed of together.     The petitioners are

working as Higher Secondary School Teachers in various

disciplines in Government Higher Secondary Schools.

They are from different districts of the State.     The

common thread as far as the petitioners are concerned

is that for appointing Principals of the respective

schools, they have been thrown out.  The dispute herein

is with respect to the non grant of suitable postings

to many of them in spite of options being submitted in

time.
</p>
<p id="p_2">    2.   Heard  the   learned    Senior   Counsel   Shri

N.N.Sugunapalan and learned counsel Shri K.Mohanakannan

appearing  for   the   petitioners   and   the   learned

Government Pleader Smt.Nisha Bose.

</p><p id="p_3">    3.   For  easy  reference,  I   shall  consider the

pleadings and documents in W.P.(C).No.2607/2011.     The

W.P.(C). No.1822/2011-C,
        and connected cases

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                         -:2:-</span>

petitioners are relying upon Ext.P1, a Circular dated

27/11/2010 issued by the Director of Higher Secondary

Education. The same relates to shifting of H.S.S.Ts,

teaching  the  same  subject as   Principals.    It  is

mentioned that the "teachers who are thrown out for

want  of   posts  consequent   as  the   transfer  and

appointments  of   Principals  in   Government   Higher

Secondary  Schools  on  the  orders  cited  above   are

directed to apply online for shifting to convenient

schools within the Districts where they are working now

in  the  Proforma   appended  on  or   before  5   P.M,

01/12/2010".     Ext.P2  is   another  Circular   dated

04/01/2011, therein also the HSSTs who became excess

are directed to apply online for transfer on or before

10/01/2011.  Those who have applied already also are

directed  to  apply  online  so  as  to  process  their

applications   along   with   the   General    Transfer

applications of HSSTs in various subjects, as per the

norms for General Transfer.
</p>
<p id="p_4">W.P.(C). No.1822/2011-C,
        and connected cases

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                         -:3:-</span>

</p><p id="p_5">    4.   It is the case of the petitioners in all these

writ petitions that they had submitted their options

showing the schools convenient to them.    They insist

that the applications submitted by them through online

were liable to be considered separately and not along

with the applications of general transfer optees.    It

is the case of the petitioners that Ext.P1 Circular as

well as Ext.P2, the later Circular, gives them a right

to submit option as they are thrown out teachers.

Finally, when orders were passed showing the list of

the transferees, many of the petitioners could not get

the opted stations and some of them did not find their

place in the list at all.  It is in those circumstances

they  approached  this  Court  by  filing  these   writ

petitions.
</p>
<p id="p_6">    5.   This Court passed a common interim order on

02/02/2011.  The Director of Higher Secondary Education

had maintained the stand that Ext.P1 Circular has

already been withdrawn and they have issued another

Circular  dated   28/01/2011  produced   as   Ext.R2(b)

W.P.(C). No.1822/2011-C,
        and connected cases

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                         -:4:-</span>

allowing  various  parties  to  submit  further  option

statement within a period of five days from the date of

the order.   This Court after considering the matter,

allowed time upto 07/02/2011 for the petitioners to

submit options.  The petitioners were allowed to file

separate objections also with regard to the complaints

regarding convenient posting given to any of their

juniors in the opted schools of the petitioners.  Again

the list was published and it is pointed out by the

petitioners that apart from the options submitted by

the petitioners, additional options were added and

shown against their names by the officials which is

really irregular.   As a result of the said exercise,

what has happened is that many of the petitioners could

not get any posting in the choice station.     Some of

them were given postings but in different stations far

away which according to the learned Senior Counsel for

the petitioners are in different districts also.

</p><p id="p_7">    6.   The learned Senior Counsel for the petitioners

Shri N.N.Sugunapalan submitted that the whole exercise

W.P.(C). No.1822/2011-C,
        and connected cases

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                         -:5:-</span>

made by the department is illegal.     It is submitted

that the case of the thrown out teachers had to be

considered  first  and  the  method  attempted  by  the

Director of Higher Secondary Education to consider

their options along with the optees under the General

Transfer applications cannot be justified.

</p><p id="p_8">    7.   The learned Government Pleader submitted that

what was done by the Department was perfectly justified

and it was as per the common guidelines issued by the

Government, a copy of which is produced as Ext.R1(a)

along with the counter affidavit.     It is therefore,

submitted that the thrown out teachers will not get any

better preference and their case can be considered only

along with general transfer applicants.

</p><p id="p_9">    8.   The respondents have filed separate counter

affidavits justifying their stand.

</p><p id="p_10">    9.   It is the case of the petitioners that in many

of the districts, vacancies may arise on 31/03/2011

because  of  retirement.    It  is  prayed  that  those

stations could be allotted to them so as to redress

their grievances.
</p>
<p id="p_11">    10. In W.P.(C).No.2697/2011 it is pointed out that

a  vacancy  will  arise  on  31/03/2011  at  Government

H.S.S., Ezhipuram, Ernakulam.
</p>
<p id="p_12">    11. As far as W.P.(C).No.2825/2011 is concerned,

it is submitted that a vacancy will arise at G.H.S.S,

Kodakara, Thrissur.
</p>
<p id="p_13">    12. With   regard  to  W.P.(C).No.2932/2011  it  is

pointed out that at the time of submission of option,

there was an open vacancy at G.H.S.S, Irinjalakuda,

Thrissur.

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_25">    17. One   of  the  points  raised  by  the  learned

Government Pleader is that the Ext.P1 Circular or the

guidelines will not confer any benefits to the thrown

out teachers.</blockquote><p id="p_23">

</p><p id="p_24">    18. The learned Senior Counsel for the petitioners

submitted that the plight of the thrown out teachers

ought to have been considered before considering the

options  submitted  by   the  applicants  for   general

transfer  because  general   transfer  applicants   are

already occupying posts in schools and there are no

W.P.(C). No.1822/2011-C,
        and connected cases

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                         -:9:-</span>

impediments for their continuance in their respective

schools.    That   the  petitioners  were  thrown   out

consequent to the transfer and appointment of the

Principals, cannot be a matter for dispute.  It is the

case of the petitioners that going by paragraph (1) of

the guidelines, namely, Ext.R1(a), it is mentioned that

the shifting of Principals will be done initially and

if any H.S.S.T's are shifted as a result of it, they

will be given opportunity to opt to their convenient

schools and also after considering their applications,

the general transfer will be effected.  This is relied

upon by the learned Senior Counsel for the petitioners

to submit that even the Government has prescribed the

very same principle and, therefore, Ext.P1 Circular was

only in tune with the general guidelines for transfer

and not against it.
</p>
<p id="p_25">    19. Since the Department has taken the stand that

the Circular Ext.P1 is not in tune with the Government

Order, the Government will have to consider all issues

in the light of the guidelines for transfer and the

W.P.(C). No.1822/2011-C,
        and connected cases

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                        -:10:-</span>

contentions raised herein.   As the petitioners point

out that the thrown out teachers should get a better

treatment,  different   from   the   general   transfer

applicants, the said aspect will be considered by the

Government.  It is pointed out by the learned counsel

for the petitioners that the cancellation of Ext.P1 is

only after the transfer orders were issued and it was

only to cause inconvenience to them.   But the learned

Government Pleader explained that the Department was of

the view that the same goes against the guidelines for

general transfer.  Based on the interim orders passed

by this Court, the petitioners who could not get the

opted  stations  are  continuing  in  their  respective

schools.  Some of the petitioners have already obtained

the opted stations and they have joined also.

</p><p id="p_26">    20. Therefore, with regard to the petitioners who

have not obtained their opted stations, they will have

to  approach  the  Government  by   filing  appropriate

representations.   Representations already filed have

         I.A.No.4629/2011 in W.P.(C).No.2825/2011.




</blockquote><p id="p_27">There will be a direction to the Government to consider

the representations filed by the petitioners and pass

appropriate orders after hearing them within a period

of  two  months.  Those  of  the  petitioners  who  are

permitted to continue in terms of the interim order,

will continue till orders are passed by the Government.

Appropriate orders will be passed by the Government

after  considering  the  case of   the  petitioners  on

merits.  It will be open to the Government to consider
