     THIS WRIT PETITION IS FILED UNDER <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_1">ARTICLE 227</a>
OF THE CONSTITUTION OF INDIA, PRAYING TO SET ASIDE
ORDER DTD. 30.11.2016 PASSED BY THE COURT OF I
ADDL. CIVIL JUDGE, SENIOR DIVISION, AT MYSORE, IN
O.S.NO.738/2014 DISMISSING I.A.NO.4 OF 2016 FILED BY
THE PETITIONER UNDER ORDER VI RULE 17 OF CPC
SEEKING FOR AMENDMENT OF WRITTEN STATEMENT
ANNEX-A SO FAR AS TO AMENDMENT NO.2 OF THE
APPLICATION AND ALLOW THE SAID AMENDMENT.

    THIS PETITION COMING ON FOR PRELIMINARY
HEARING THIS DAY, THE COURT MADE THE FOLLOWING:

                       ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">     Petitioner is the defendant and respondents are

plaintiffs in O.S.No.738/2014, which suit has been

instituted for recovery of money of Rs.2,16,57,700/-

contending interalia that said amount had been paid by

the plaintiffs to the defendant by account payee cheques

by transferring from their account to defendant's

account and to secure repayment of said amount,

defendant had executed a mortgage deed on 21.03.2012

by depositing the title deeds of the property as described

thereunder.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">     2.    Defendant on service      of suit summons

appeared, filed his written statement and denied the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                             3</span>


averments made in the plaint except to the extent

expressly admitted therein. On the basis of pleadings,

issues came to be framed and parties have gone for

trial.    When the   matter was    set down for cross

examination of plaintiffs' witnesses, an application for

amendment of written statement came to be filed by

defendant proposing to incorporate paragraphs 3(a),

3(b), 3(c), 3(d), 3(e), 16(a) and 16(b). This application

was opposed by the plaintiffs and trial Court by the

impugned order has rejected the said application on the

ground that plea which was sought to be put forward is

relating to the period of pre-execution of mortgage deed

dated 21.03.2012 and defendant is not entitled to

contend that he has made payment prior to execution of

document by order dated 30.11.2016. Assailing said

order, defendant is before this Court.


</p><p id="p_4">         3.   I   have   heard    the    arguments     of

Sri.G.Krishnamurthy, learned Senior Counsel appearing

on behalf of Sri. Purushotham, for petitioner and Sri.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                            4</span>


Yoganarasimha, learned Senior Counsel appearing on

behalf of Smt.Deepashree, for respondents/plaintiffs.


</p><p id="p_5">     4.    Sri.G.Krishnamurthy,      learned       Senior

counsel appearing for petitioner would fairly submit

that petitioner/defendant would restrict his claim for

amendment of written statement only in respect of

Amendment No.2, whereunder defendant has sought to

incorporate paragraph 3(6) only. Proposed amendment

reads as under:
</p>
<p id="p_6">           "AMENDMENT NO.2:           After para
           No.3(a) to include a fresh para under
           reference No.3(b).
</p>
<p id="p_7">                 3(b). The Defendant submits
           that the Defendant from the money
           actually received by him repaid a sum
           of Rs.30,00,000/- (Rupees Thirty
           Lakh only) towards principal of the
           loan by way of three posted dated
           cheques bearing Nos.061111, 061112
           and 061113 dated            1-10-2012
           drawn on State Bank of Travancore,
           Mysuru Branch for a sum of
           Rs.10,00,000/- (Rupees Ten Lakh
           only) each. From the three cheques
           the last of the cheque bearing
           No.061113 came to be returned.
</p><p id="p_8">           Thereafter the said amount was paid
           by the Defendant to the Plaintiff
           through cash. The Plaintiff has not
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                   5</span>


              given deduction to the said sum in
              the course of the plaint."
</p>
<p id="p_9">
</p><p id="p_10">       5.     It is sought to be pleaded by defendant

under proposed amendment that three (3) payments

came    to be      made    by defendant to       plaintiffs   on

01.10.2012 under three (3) cheques and out of three (3)

cheques one of the cheque had been dishonoured or in

other words, it was not realized and defendant has also

sought to plead that said amount was paid by cash to

plaintiffs.   In fact, Sri. Yoganarasimha, learned Senior

Counsel appearing for respondents has contended that

plaintiffs have been cross-examined on this aspect

before trial court and as such, there is no need or

necessity     to   plead   this   fact.   When   defendant    is

contending that he has paid the amounts to plaintiffs it

is needless to state that burden is on him to prove the

said fact namely, whether amounts have been paid to

plaintiffs and if so, when, where and how such payment

was made. Any exercise if undertaken by this Court to

examine said plea on merits, it is likely to prejudice the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                 6</span>


rights of both parties, hence no opinion is expressed in

that regard.
</p>
<p id="p_11">
</p><p id="p_12">       6.     Be that as it may.           Perusal of written

statement would indicate that defendant has pleaded

certain amounts have been paid to plaintiffs and by

proposed amendment defendant has sought to amplify

or specifically plead as to when amounts namely

Rs.30,00,000/- was paid by him. Amendment of written

statement      stands     on   a     different   footing    than

amendment of a plaint and in case of <a href="/doc/1247346/" id="a_2">SUSHIL KUMAR

JAIN vs. MANOJ KUMAR &amp; ANOTHER</a> reported in AIR

2009 SC 2544 Hon'ble Apex Court has held that even

admission made in the written statement can be

explained or amplified and Court has to adopt more

liberal     approach    than   adopting    the   approach    for

allowing amendment of plaint.
</p>
<p id="p_13">
</p><p id="p_14">       7.     In the light of said law enunciated by the

Apex      Court   and    taking     into   consideration    that

defendant had already pleaded that he had paid certain

amounts to plaintiffs and now by proposed amendment
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                    7</span>


namely, Amendment No.2 defendant is seeking to

incorporate paragraph 3(b) to the written statement

specifying thereunder that he has paid an amount of

Rs.30,00,000/-       to      plaintiffs,    if   allowed   to   be

incorporated, no prejudice would be caused to plaintiffs.

As already observed hereinabove, burden is on the

defendant to establish the said fact and no amount of

plea would amount to proof and any plea raised has to

be proved.

the following:
