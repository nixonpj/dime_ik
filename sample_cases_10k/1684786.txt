                                  JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">      This writ petition is filed by the unmarried daughter of late Shri

Choyankadan Raman Nambiar who was a freedom fighter. It is stated that

she is remaining without any employment. The grievance raised in the writ

petition is that the respondents, in spite of various applications submitted by

the petitioner, have not sanctioned the pension under the Swathanthratha

Sainik Samman Pension Scheme, along with arrears.
</p>
<p id="p_2">      2. Late Shri Choyankadan Raman Nambiar was an active participant

in the freedom struggle and was arrested in connection with Kavumbhai

struggle and had undergone imprisonment. It is stated that he was arrested

on 31.1.1947 in Crime No.117/1946 of Thaliparamba Police Station and

remanded to jail. The offences levelled against the petitioner's father were

under Sections 147, 148, 332 read with 307 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_1">IPC</a>. It is further stated that the

criminal case was committed to the Sessions Judge, North Malabar and it

was tried as S.C. 21/1947. The petitioner's late father was in jail as an

under trial prisoner from 31.1.1947 and no bail was granted and finally he

was convicted by the Sessions Court and was transferred to Central Jail,

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">wpc 28033/2009                        2</span>

Vellore. He was the 89th accused in the crime. Ext.P1, true extract of the

register of under trial prisoners maintained by the Superintendent, Central

Jail, Kannur is relied upon in support of the above.
</p>
<p id="p_3">      3. It is pointed out that Kavumbhai struggle has been recognised by

the Central Government as part of the freedom struggle as per Ext.P2 order

dated 20.1.1998. Ext.P3 is the copy of the application submitted by the

petitioner's late father for pension. The matter was enquired through the

District Collector, Kannur and District Advisory Committee recommended

the case of the petitioner's father for SSS pension and the Government

forwarded their recommendation as per Ext.P4.
</p>
<p id="p_4">      4. The petitioner's father died on 10.11.2007 and under the Scheme

for pension, an unmarried daughter is entitled for the benefits. Ext.P5 is the

copy of the proceedings to prove that the petitioner is receiving State

pension which was originally granted to her late father.

</p><p id="p_5">      5. It is submitted by the learned counsel for the petitioner that the

Central Government has not so far communicated any decision in the matter

in spite of the State Government recommending the same and                 the

application is accompanied by valid documents.
</p>
<p id="p_6">      6. A reading of Ext.P4 verification-cum-entitlement report by the

State Government shows that after relying upon the extract of the under

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">wpc 28033/2009                          3</span>

trial register, the application has been recommended.

</p><p id="p_7">       7.   In that view of the matter, there will be a direction to the

respondents      to take a decision on the application submitted by the

petitioner for SSS pension within a period of five months from the date of

receipt of a copy of this judgment. Since this is an old claim, more

attention should be given by respondents 1 and 2 to consider the matter and

pass orders within the above time frame.
</p>
<p id="p_8">       The writ petition is disposed of as above. No costs.
</p>
