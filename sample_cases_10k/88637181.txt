               -------------------------------------
                   Crl.M.C.No. 1344 of 2013
             -----------------------------------------
           Dated this the 22nd day of March, 2013

                            O R D E R
</pre>
<p id="p_1">           The petitioner is the third accused in Crime No.6/2009

of Vellarikund Police Station in Kasargod District registered

alleging commission of offences punishable under Sections 452

and 323 r/w <a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_1">Section 34</a> of the Indian Penal Code against him and

his co-accused. Annexure-A is the FIR registered in that crime.

After the investigation Annexure-B        Final Report was laid

thereon. Cognizance was taken on the said final report and it

was taken on file as C.C.No.159/2009 by the Court of the Judicial

First Class Magistrate-II, Hosdurg. The co-accused of the

petitioners were tried by the Court of the Judicial First Class

Magistrate-II, Hosdurg in C.C.No.159/2009 and they were

acquitted as per Annexure-C judgment dated 05.09.2011.Since

the petitioner was then absconding the case as against him was

split up and it was re-filed as C.C.No.987/2011. This petition is

filed seeking quashment of Annexure-B Final Report and all

further proceedings pursuant thereto against the petitioner in

C.C.No.987/2011 which is, now, pending before the Court of the

Crl.M.C.No. 1344 of 2013
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                  2</span>

Judicial First Class Magistrate-II, Hosdurg on the strength of

Annexure-C judgment, Annexures-D settlement and Annexure-E

affidavit sworn in by the first respondent, who is the defacto

complainant in the aforesaid crime and on whom the hurt was

caused. He was also wrongfully restrained.
</p>
<p id="p_2">            2.    I have heard the learned counsel for the

petitioner, the learned counsel for the first respondent and also

the the learned Public Prosecutor.
</p>
<p id="p_3">            3.    As noticed hereinbefore the petitioner seeks for

quashing Annexure-B Final Report and all further proceedings in

C.C.No.987/2011 on the files of the Court of the Judicial First

Class Magistrate-II, Hosdurg on the strength of Annexures-C,D

and E. Annexure-C is the judgment of acquittal passed by the

Court of the Judicial First Class Magistrate -II, Hosdurg in respect

of all the co-accused of the petitioner who stood the trial        in

C.C.No.159/2009.       That cannot by itself be a reason for the

petitioner to contend that he is not liable to face the trial or that

the proceedings against him pending before that court is liable to

be quashed, in the light of a Full Bench decision of this Court in

Crl.M.C.No. 1344 of 2013
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                  3</span>

<a href="/doc/1958014/" id="a_2">Moosa V. Sub Inspector of Police</a> reported in 2006(1) KLT 552

(F.B.). The only exception to the law is laid in paragraph 50

thereunder. Going by the same in a case where the substratum

of the very prosecution case is lost with the pronouncement of a

judgment of acquittal of co-accused the general law laid down

would not be applicable. A scanning of Annexure-C judgment

would reveal the non-applicability of the aforesaid exception in

the case of the petitioner and as such, I am of the considered

view that the petitioner cannot be heard to contend that he is not

liable to face trial or that the entire proceedings pending against

him are liable to be quashed on the strength of Annexure-C

judgment. The learned counsel for the petitioner very fairly

conceded the position of non-applicability of the exception to the

law laid in Moosa's case (supra) in this case. In that decision this

Court held that a judgment of acquittal of co-accused would not

be a bar for the subsequent trial of an absconding accused.

</p><p id="p_4">            4.    In this case certain other aspects also call for

consideration. Annexure-A FIR and Annexure-B Final Report

would reveal that the petitioner and his co-accused were accused

Crl.M.C.No. 1344 of 2013
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                4</span>

of commission of offences punishable under <a href="/doc/838469/" id="a_3">Sections 452</a> and

<a href="/doc/1011035/" id="a_4">323</a> r/w <a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_5">Section 34</a> of the Indian Penal Code. Offence punishable

under <a href="/doc/1011035/" id="a_6">Section 323</a>, <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_7">IPC</a> is compoundable in terms of the

provisions under <a href="/doc/895891/" id="a_8">Section 320</a>, <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_9">Cr.P.C</a>. whilst the offence

punishable under <a href="/doc/838469/" id="a_10">Section 452</a> is not compoundable. However,

that cannot be a reason for declining the exercise of inherent

power under <a href="/doc/903398/" id="a_11">Section 482</a>, <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_12">Cr.P.C</a>. if the case on hand is otherwise

a fit case for its invocation going by the decision of the

Honourable Apex Court in       <a href="/doc/469138/" id="a_13">B.S.Joshi V. State of Haryana</a>

reported in 2003 (2) KLT 1062

</p><p id="p_5">            5.    The submissions made by the learned counsel for

the first respondent with Annexure- D settlement dated

26.04.2012 Annexure-E affidavit sworn in by the first respondent

fully endorsing would reveal that the entire disputes that

constrained the first respondent to lodge the complaint against

the petitioner and his co-accused that ultimately resulted in

registration of the aforesaid crime against them have been

amicably settled.     I am of the view that even if the criminal

proceedings are compelled to be continued against the petitioner

Crl.M.C.No. 1344 of 2013
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                   5</span>

no fruitful purpose could be served as the chance for a successful

prosecution against the petitioner herein is very bleak in the

aforesaid circumstances. The nature of the injuries and

Annexures-A and B would reveal that the petitioner cannot be

said to have committed heinous offence and on the otherhand

they would suggest that the petitioner and the first respondent

are justified in contending that the nature of the case is personal

and private and therefore, they are entitled to settle the disputes

and seeks for termination of the criminal proceedings against the

petitioner in the light of the decisions of the Honourable Supreme

Court in B.S.Joshi's case (supra) and in <a href="/doc/69949024/" id="a_14">Gian Singh V. State of

Punjab</a> reported in 2012(4)KLT 108(SC). In such circumstances,

allowing continuation of the criminal proceedings against the

petitioner would not be in the interest of justice and it would

ultimately result in sheer wasting of the invaluable time of the

court. In this context it is to be noted that Accused Nos. 1, 2 and

4 in the Crime No.6/2009 who stood the trial in C.C.No.159/2009

before the Court of the Judicial First Class Magistrate-II, Hosdurg

were acquitted as per Annexure-C judgment. It is also to be

Crl.M.C.No. 1344 of 2013
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                6</span>

noted in this context that the petitioner herein was implicated as

an accused in this case with the help of <a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_15">Section 34</a> of the Indian

Penal Code and evidently no specific overt act is alleged against

him. In the decision       in Gian Singh's case (supra) the

Honourable Apex Court held that it is the duty of the High Courts

to prevent continuation of criminal proceedings which became

absolutely unnecessary, in the interest of justice. In the totality

of the circumstances I am inclined to invoke the inherent power

under <a href="/doc/903398/" id="a_16">Section 482</a>, <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_17">Cr.P.C</a>.     to terminate the entire criminal

proceedings against the petitioner. Resultantly, this Crl.M.C. is

allowed. Annexure-A FIR and Annexure-B Final Report laid in

Crime No. 6/2009 of Vellarikund Police Station and all further

proceedings     against  the  petitioner   pursuant   thereto    in

C.C.No.987/2011 on the files of the Court of the Judicial First

Class Magistrate-II Hosdurg are hereby quashed.
