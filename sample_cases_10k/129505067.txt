     Age:60 Years, Occupation: Agriculture,
     Resident of Hullolihatti-591 309,
     Taluka Hukeri, District: Belagavi.
                                            ... Respondents

(Respondent Nos.1 to 3 are served, but unrepresented)

      This Regular First Appeal is filed under Section 96 read
with Order 41 Rule 1 of Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, against
the judgment and decree dated 03.03.2015, passed in O.S.No.58
of 2013, on the file of Senior Civil Judge, Hukkeri, decreeing
the suit filed for partition and separate possession.

      This Regular First Appeal coming on for hearing, this
day, Anand Byrareddy J., delivered the following:

                           JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">      The    respondents    have      been   served     and   remain

unrepresented.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                :3:</span><p id="p_2">



</p><p id="p_3">2.    Heard the learned counsel for the appellant.        The

appellant was defendant No.1 before the Court below in a suit

for partition and separate possession.

</p><p id="p_4">3.    The genealogical tree of the appellant's family is as

follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">                     Bhimappa (Propositus)



                   Ramappa (Dead)        Laxmana (Dead)


                   Shivappa
               (Defendant No.2)



          Gouravva             Sattevva          Irappa
      (Wife-plaintiff No.1) (Plaintiff No.2) (Defendant No.1)


</blockquote><p id="p_5">4.    The claim for partition was in respect of the share that

had fallen to Laxmana as between himself and his brother.

Laxmana having died in the year 2003, the succession opened

and according to the law as prevailing in the year 2003,

property belonging to Laxmana's branch would have been

shared at a notional partition between Laxmana and Irappa, the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                :4:</span>



present appellant and out of the share that Laxmana would have

got, it would be equally divided between the plaintiffs and the

present appellant. However, the trial Court has decreed the suit

granting 2/3rd share in the Â½ share in the suit schedule property.

This would be an incorrect application of the law, as rightly

contended by the learned counsel for the appellant.          The

property would have to be divided equally between the father

and the son, namely, Laxmana and Irappa and thereafter out of

the share of the father, each of the surviving legal

representatives, namely, the widow of Laxmana and             the

daughter and son of Laxmana would get one share each.

Therefore, the judgment and decree would have to be modified

accordingly.
</p>
<p id="p_6">
</p><p id="p_7">5.    The appeal is therefore allowed as prayed for.          the

plaintiffs are entitled to one share each along with the present

appellant in the half share that would fall to Laxmana at a

notional partition.
</p>
<p id="p_8">6.    It is stated that the present defendant has constructed a

house after having raised a loan with the bank and that he is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                               :5:</span>



repaying the loan at his own cost. Therefore, if the plaintiffs

are to be given a share in the said house, they would have to

proportionately share the liability of discharging the loan. The

appellant undertakes to furnish accounts in respect of such loan

transaction.
</p>
<p id="p_9">      The preliminary decree of the Court below stands

modified in terms as above.
