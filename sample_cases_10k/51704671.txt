                      JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">      The plaintiff-bank has filed this suit for recovery of

sum of Rs.3,73,083/- with interest from the defendants

jointly and severally and for sale of hypothecated vehicle.


</p><p id="p_2">      2.     The brief facts of the plaintiff's case are

as under:-
</p>
<p id="p_3">      The plaintiff is a Body Corporate constituted under

the   Banking    Companies        (Regulation     &amp;   <a href="/doc/1232997/" id="a_1">Transfer       of

Undertakings) Act</a>, 1980, having its Head Office at

Mangalore     and    inter-alia       branch     at   Vijayanagar,

Bengaluru.
</p>
<p id="p_4">      Defendant     No.1   on     the    guarantee       of   second

defendant availed loan of Rs.3,46,948/- on 28.03.2012

for purchase of Tata Indica V2LS Car by executing

necessary documents, agreeing to repay it with interest

at 12.75% p.a. in 60 monthly instalments of Rs.7,829/-

each and hypothecated the purchased vehicle.

</p><p id="p_5">      Further case of the plaintiff-bank is that after

utilizing the said loan, defendants failed to repay the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                  3            O.S.No.7315/2014</span>



amount as agreed by them and committed default inspite

of requests, demands and legal notice. Hence plaintiff-

bank has been constrained to file this suit for recovery of

Rs.3,73,083/- with interest at 12.75% per annum.

</p><p id="p_6">       3.    After service of summons, the defendants

remained absent, hence placed exparte. Thereafter one

R.M.    Thippeswamy,         Manager    of   the   plaintiff-bank

examined as P.W.1 and got the documents marked as

Ex.P.1 to Ex.P.7.
</p>
<p id="p_7">       4.    Heard arguments of plaintiff's counsel and

perused the records.
</p>
<p id="p_8">
</p><p id="p_9">       5.    The points that arise for my determination are

as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">             1)   Whether      the    plaintiff-bank   is
                  entitled      for      decree        of
                  Rs.3,73,083/- with future interest
                  at 12.75% per annum?
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">             2)   What order?</blockquote><p id="p_10">

</p><p id="p_11">       6.    My findings on the above points are as

follows:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">             1) In the affirmative;
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">             2) As per final order, for the following:-
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                4               O.S.No.7315/2014</span>



</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_6">                       REASONS
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_7">     7. POINT No.1:- After going through the materials

on record, it is evident that defendant No.1 on the

guarantee   of   second    defendant           availed   loan     of

Rs.3,46,948/- on 28.03.2012 for purchase of Tata Indica

V2LS Car by executing necessary documents, agreeing to

repay it with interest at 12.75% p.a. in 60 monthly

instalments of Rs.7,829/- each and hypothecated the

purchased   vehicle.   After       utilizing    the   said   loan,

defendants failed to repay the amount as agreed by them

and committed default inspite of requests, demands and

legal notice and hence the defendants are liable to pay

the suit claim amount with interest.</blockquote><p id="p_12">

</p><p id="p_13">     8. It is matter of record that after receipt of

summons, defendants remained absent, hence placed

exparte. Thus the case of plaintiff-bank and the oral and

documentary evidence placed on record by the plaintiff-

bank against the defendants to show that it had lent loan

of Rs.3,46,948/- and outstanding dues of Rs.3,73,083/-

as on the date of the suit as well as execution of

documents by the defendants in favour of the Bank are

all remained unchallenged. As per the Bankers' Book

Evidence Act as well as <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_2">Negotiable Instrument Act</a>,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                    5            O.S.No.7315/2014</span>



documents      produced       by       the    plaintiff-bank       got

presumptive value in the eye of law. As per Order VIII

Rule 10 CPC, when the defendants are called upon to file

written statement and not filed, the suit of the plaintiff

has to be decreed. It is therefore I am of the confident

opinion that the plaintiff-bank has successfully proved

that it had lent loan of Rs.3,46,948/- to the defendants

with interest at 12.75% p.a. and the defendants failed to

repay the loan amount. As such, it is entitled to decree

for recovery of Rs.3,73,083/- with future interest at

12.75% p.a., but yearly rests. Hence, point under

discussion is answered in affirmative.


</p><p id="p_14">     9. POINT No.2:- For the reasons stated above, I

proceed to pass the following:-

<p id="p_15">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_8">                          ORDER

     entitled to recover suit claim amount of

     Rs.3,73,083/-     with    future        interest   at

     12.75% p.a. at yearly rests from the date

     defendants jointly and severally.

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_10">           The defendants are directed to pay

     the decreetal amount with interest within 6

     months, failing which, the bank is at liberty

     to recover the outstanding loan amount by

     way of sale of the hypothecated schedule

     property and if sale proceeds failed to

     satisfy the due amount, the plaintiff-bank

     is   at   liberty   to   proceed   against   the

     defendants and their properties.
