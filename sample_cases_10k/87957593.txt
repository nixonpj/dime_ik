                 ======================================================
                 CORAM: HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE NAVIN SINHA
                 ORAL ORDER</pre>

<p id="p_1">2   02-07-2012                Heard learned counsel for the petitioner and the

                   State.
</p>
<p id="p_2">                              The petitioner is aggrieved by the enquiry report

                   dated 6.1.2012 submitted in a departmental proceeding

                   initiated against him during service, but continued under

                   Rule-43(b) of the Bihar Pension Rules.
</p>
<p id="p_3">                              Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that one

                   Dr. Nirmal Kumar Singh was suspended and filed C.W.J.C.

                   No.13480/09. On 12.1.2010 the Court directed status quo

                   ante. The petitioner in his capacity as a Civil Surgeon passed

                   appropriate orders in terms of the directions of the Court on

                   22.1.2010.      He     informed      the    authorities      also    who

                   subsequently recalled the suspension of Dr. Nirmal Kumar

                   Singh on 22.6.2010. A charge memo was issued to him on

                   26.4.2011 for indiscipline by issuance of letter dated

                   22.1.2010 without departmental approval.

</p><p id="p_4">                              If the petitioner acted pursuant to the orders of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1"> Patna High Court CWJC No.11004 of 2012 (2) dt.02-07-2012                        2</span>




               Court, he committed no illegality. He took this defence in his

               reply to the charges. The enquiry report annexed to the

               second show cause notice given to him does not consider

               this very crucial defence of his and therefore the enquiry

               report itself suffers from gross illegality when it fails to

               consider an extremely relevant defence. The Court may

               therefore set aside the enquiry report.

</p><p id="p_5">                           Learned counsel for the State submits that if the

               petitioner had participated in the departmental proceedings

               and the proceedings appear on the verge of conclusion

               directions may be issued for concluding the departmental

               proceeding at an early date.
</p>
<p id="p_6">                           Prima facie, the facts, as presented, appear to be

               that one Dr. Nirmal Kumar Singh was suspended. This

               Court on 12.1.2010 directed:- "In the meantime, petitioner

               will not be disturbed and the status quo as existing before

               issuance of suspension order shall be maintained by the

               parties".
</p>
<p id="p_7">                           Reading the order reasonably and prudently, it

               leads to only one conclusion that for all purposes the order

               of suspension was stayed. If that be so, the petitioner being

               the controlling authority of Dr. Nirmal Kumar Singh and

               also Respondent No.7 in the writ petition appears to have

               acted only in implementation of the impugned order. Once

               the Court pronounces on an issue, the order of the Court
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">             Patna High Court CWJC No.11004 of 2012 (2) dt.02-07-2012                                     3</span>




                           has to be implemented by one and all concerned, especially

                           when they are parties to the litigation. Any bureaucratic

                           procedure or ministerial act to be performed by issuance of

                           any formal order by the authorities in pursuance of an order

                           of a Court does not override or supersede the order of the

                           Court to the extent that the order of the Court shall not

                           remain      unoperational         till   the   ministerial   act   is   not

                           performed. Such an interpretation shall be rendering Court

                           orders a futility and nugatory.
</p>
<p id="p_8">                                       If the Court stayed the suspension on 12.1.2010,

                           the subsequent order by the authorities on 22.6.2010 was a

                           ministerial act. The defence of the petitioner is that he acted

                           in implementation of the Court order in a writ petition which

                           impleaded him as a respondent also. He was also the

                           controlling authority.
</p>
<p id="p_9">                                       Let the respondents pass final appropriate orders

                           in the departmental proceeding within a maximum period of

                           four weeks from the date of receipt/production of a copy of

                           this order.
</p>
<p id="p_10">                                       The writ application stands disposed.
</p>
<p id="p_11">                                                        (Navin Sinha, J)
