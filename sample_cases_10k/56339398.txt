<p id="p_4">                                         C. O. No. 1482 of 2018

                                            Sri Barhan Das
                                                  Vs.
</p><p id="p_5">                                    Sri Ram Awadh Shah and another

       Mr. Sudip Ghosh Chowdhury

                      ...for the petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_6">       Mr. Tanmoy Chowdhury

                      ...for the opposite parties.
</p>
<p id="p_7">       The defendant in a suit for eviction has preferred the instant revisional application.

       Initially an order was passed under Section 7(2) of the West Bengal Premises

Tenancy Act, 1997 directing the defendant/petitioner to deposit the arrears of rent,

however, the quantum of interest was not calculated in such order. Subsequently, the

petitioner took out an application for modification of such order for quantification of the

amount of interest.
</p>
<p id="p_8">       The modification application was allowed on May 10, 2008, thereby directing the

petitioner to deposit a composite amount of Rs.9,275/- (Rupees nine thousand two

hundred and seventy five) only within one month from that date.

</p><p id="p_9">       It is an admitted position that the said amount could not be deposited by the

petitioner within the stipulated period of one month. The first instalment of such arrear

was deposited on the day after the expiry of the said period and the rest, a few days

thereafter within the same month.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                               2</span><p id="p_10">


</p><p id="p_11">       The suit was thereafter dismissed for default and subsequently restored on the

prayer of the plaintiffs/opposite parties. In the interregnum no deposit could be made by

the petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_12">       After restoration of the suit, the petitioner approached the court below with an

application seeking an order for depositing the unpaid dues for the period during which

the suit remained dismissed for default.
</p>
<p id="p_13">       By virtue of the impugned order, such prayer was refused and the matter was fixed

for hearing of an application under Section 7(3) of the Act of 1997 filed by the

plaintiffs/opposite parties.
</p>
<p id="p_14">       Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the petitioner was, in any event,

entitled to at least one extension as per the provisions of the said Act of 1997 and the

court below refused to exercise jurisdiction vested in it by law in refusing such prayer.

</p><p id="p_15">       Controverting such submission, learned counsel for the opposite parties argues

that, in terms of the proviso to sub-section (2) of Section 7 of the said Act of 1997, the

petitioner had to pay/deposit the amount directed vide order dated May 10, 2008 to the

trial court within one month from that date. Even if the order dated May 10, 2008 could be

deemed to be a part of the initial order passed under Section 7(2) of the said Act of 1997,

the payment was made after the period stipulated in the order dated May 10, 2008,

thereby subjecting the petitioner to the rigours of sub-section (3) of Section 7 of the 1997

Act.
</p>
<p id="p_16">       It is further argued on behalf of the opposite parties that although the said default

remained on the part of the petitioner, no prayer for extension or for acceptance of such

delayed deposit was ever made by the petitioner at any point of time.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                                    3</span>


</p><p id="p_17">       The only application made by the petitioner in this context was for being permitted

to deposit the arrears for another period when the suit remained dismissed for default.

</p><p id="p_18">       Upon hearing both sides and going through the materials on record, it is evident

that the petitioner did not pray for extension in respect of the payment directed to be made

by the order dated May 10, 2008, although the amount quantified therein was paid late by

the petitioner. The other prayer, for acceptance of deposit for the period when the suit

was dismissed for default, was unrelated to the direction dated May 10, 2008.

</p><p id="p_19">       In such view of the matter, the petitioner would, in any event, be subject to the

rigours of Section 7(3) of the Act of 1997. The other aspect of the matter is that, despite

having been dismissed for default and restored subsequently, the suit remained the same

and the non-compliance of the order by the petitioner with the provisions of Section 7(2) of

the Act of 1997 still continues to remain in force.
</p>
<p id="p_20">       In view of such non-compliance, the trial court was justified in refusing the

subsequent prayer of the petitioner to deposit further arrears.

</p><p id="p_21">       Accordingly, C. O. No. 1482 of 2018 is dismissed on contest, without any order as

to costs.
</p>
<p id="p_22">       Urgent certified website copies of this order, if applied for, be made available to the

parties upon compliance with the requisite formalities.

</p><p id="p_23">                  (Sabyasachi Bhattacharyya, J.)
