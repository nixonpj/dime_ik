Ld.   Predecessor   of   this   Court   has   doubted   the   very   factum   of   any   such 
incident having taken place. Accordingly the said judgment was perused and 
it was found that during the course of trial the Ld. Judge called for the 
records of the movements of the police officials from the office of Special 
Staff and after perusing the same and analysing the deposition of  police 
officials   who   had   apprehended   the   present   accused   or   the   other   accused 
persons,   doubted   the   factum   of   any   such   incident   as   deposed   to   by   the 
prosecution   witnesses   having   ever   taken   place.   It     was   in   these 
circumstances that a detailed order sheet dated 14.03.14, it was observed by 
the undersigned that no purpose will be served by recording the statement

passed by my Ld. Predecessor which has since attained finality having been 
not challenged by the prosecution so no incriminating evidence exists on

                 basis of a secret information a police party was constituted  
                 and they intercepted one  motorcycle with two riders and a  
                 TSR in which four persons were travelling. However upon  
                 seeing the police party the pillion driver of motorcycle took  
                 out a pistol and fired towards the police party but no one  
                 was injured.  It   is further  the case  of  prosecution that the  
                 motorcyclist himself also took out a desi katta and pointed  
                 towards the police party. The police party however managed  
                 to apprehend both the motorcyclist and three out of the four  
                 TSR   riders.   The   fourth   person   managed   to   flee   away.  
                 Accordingly charge sheet was filed in the court against five  
                 accused persons. However the then Ld. Predecessor of this  
                 court vide order dated 02.5.2006 discharged accused Sanjay  
                 and Manoj of all the charges in this case but chose to frame  
                 charges   for   the   offence   u/s   307/34   <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_11">IPC</a>   against   accused  
                 Shamim, Jakir and Abidur. Separate charges for the offence  
                 u/s 25 of the <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_12">Arms Act</a> were also framed against all the three  
                 accused persons as they were allegedly found in possession  
                 of pistol at the time of incident.

                 prosecution   evidence   was   being   recorded   two   accused  
                 persons   namely,   Shamim   and   Jakir   absconded   away   and  
                 were   declared   Proclaimed   Offender   vide   order   dated  
                 09.01.2009.   The   trial   thereafter   proceeded   only   against  
                 accused   Abidur   Rehman.     Subsequently   vide   a   detailed  
                 judgment dated 06.01.2012 the then Ld. Predecessor of this  
                 court  namely, Sh. H. S. Sharma acquitted accused Abidur  
                 Rehman of all the charges giving him the benefit of doubt.  
                 The prime consideration which prevailed with the Ld. Judge  
                 while acquitting accused Abidur Rehman was that during the  
                 course of trial the record of the Police Station vide which the  
                 police party had allegedly left for the spot or later reached  
                 back after apprehending the accused persons or the rukka  

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">State Vs.Mohd. Shamim @ Chaman                                                                                                    Page No.   7 of 10</span>
                  was sent to the police station from the spot and the copy of  
                 FIR thereafter was sent back was called for. The Ld. Judge  
                 after   detailed   analysis   of   the   said   record   visÂ­aÂ­vis   the  
                 statements   of   the   police   witnesses   so   examined   by   the  
                 prosecution found inherent improbabilities in the entire story  
                 as unfolded by the witnesses. Thus doubted that any such  
                 incident   at   all   took   place.   No   public   witnesses   were  
                 admittedly joined in the proceedings by the IO and Ld. Judge  
                 also came to the  conclusion that in view of the said inherent  
                 improbabilities, the entire story of the prosecution much less  
                 the explanation furnished for nonÂ­joining of public witnesses  
                 was highly doubtful.   The file was thereafter consigned to  
                 record room u/s 299 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_13">Cr.P.C</a>. qua accused Shamim and Jakir  
                 who   were   proclaimed   offenders.   Subsequently   accused  
                 Shamim came to be apprehended and the present trial thus  
                 proceeded against them.

                 order   sheets   recorded   by   my   Ld.   predecessor   certain  
                 confusion   arose   as   trial   of   the   present   case   was   being

                 the two cases.

                 considered view that in view of the detailed judgment passed  
                 by   my   Ld.   Predecessor   which   is   based   on   cogent   and  
                 convincing   reasoning,   the   very   basis   of   the   entire  
                 prosecution case has become doubtful. In fact a perusal of  

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">State Vs.Mohd. Shamim @ Chaman                                                                                                    Page No.   8 of 10</span>
                  the said judgment which has since attained finality as it has  
                 not been challenged either by the State or by anybody else  
                 till   date   shows   that   the   records   of   the   Police   Station  
                 completely belies the taking place of any such incident at all.  
                 Thus it will be an exercise in futility   to continue with the  
                 present trial much less recording the statement of accused  
                 u/s 313 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_17">Cr.P.C</a>. From a perusal of the entire record coupled  
                 with the judgment rendered by my Ld. predecessor it is thus  
                 clear   that   no   incriminating   evidence   exists   on   record   as  
                 against present accused Shamim for which he may be called
