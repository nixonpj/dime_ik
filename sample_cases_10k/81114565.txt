                         J U D G M E N T

<p id="p_1">           The decision of the Indian Railways Catering and

Tourism Corporation Limited ('the Corporation' for short), as

communicated to the petitioner as per Ext.P12, is under

challenge in this writ petition.
</p>
<p id="p_2">           2. The facts relevant for decision are the following :

           The Corporation invited bids for running a food plaza

at the South Railway Station, Ernakulam for a period of nine

years on the terms and conditions stipulated in the bid

document. The petitioner was one among the bidders. The

award of the right was based on the percentage of licence fee

offered by the bidders on the sales turn over projected by them

for the period of nine years. The petitioner being the highest

bidder, they were awarded the right to conduct the food plaza.

As per the terms of the bid document, the petitioner had to

construct the structures required for conducting the food plaza

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">WPC 11977/16                     2</span>




in the place earmarked by the Corporation in the Railway

Station building.   Pursuant to the award, the petitioner had

constructed the necessary structures in a portion of the Railway

Station building and opened the food plaza on 27.9.2004.

Ext.R4(f) is the agreement executed by the petitioner with the

Corporation in this connection with the conduct of the food

plaza. As per Ext.R4(f), the arrangement was for a period of

nine years from 27.9.2004.        The period specified in the

agreement was due to expire on 26.9.2013. It is also provided

in the agreement that the arrangement is renewable by three

years more from 26.9.2013. In the light of the said provision,

before the expiry of the period, the Corporation sought the

willingness of the petitioner to continue the arrangement for a

further period of three years as per Ext.R4(b) communication on

the further terms and conditions specified therein. Though the

petitioner communicated his willingness to continue the

arrangement for a further period of three years on the terms

and conditions stipulated in Ext.R4(b) as per Ext.R4(c), the

arrangement was extended initially only for a period of six

months. Later, the arrangement was extended for the balance

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">WPC 11977/16                     3</span>




period also.   While   the petitioner was conducting the food

plaza under the extended period, they submitted Ext.P10

representation to the Corporation, stating that the bid process

was initiated for award of the right to run the food plaza based

on the catering policy evolved by the Railways in the year

2000; that as per the said policy, the tenure of the licence

arrangement in respect of projects involving substantial civil

construction is twelve years renewable for a further period of

three years; that the project undertaken by the petitioner was a

project involving substantial civil construction; that the tenure

of the licence arrangement was shown by mistake in the bid

document and also in the agreement as nine years and that all

other similarly placed licensees have been granted a term of

twelve years renewable by three years.           The petitioner,

therefore, prayed for orders permitting them to continue for a

period of fifteen years. The request made by the petitioner as

per Ext.P10 representation was turned down by the Corporation

as per Ext.P12 communication stating that as per the terms of

the bid document and the agreement, the petitioner is entitled

to licence only for a maximum period of twelve years. Ext.P12

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">WPC 11977/16                      4</span>




is under challenge in this writ petition.
</p>
<p id="p_3">           3.    A counter affidavit has been filed by the

Corporation.   The essence of the contentions raised by the

Corporation in the counter affidavit is that in the light of the

categoric terms in the bid document as also in the agreement

executed by the petitioner with the Corporation, the petitioner

is not entitled to claim extension of the arrangement beyond

twelve years. According to the Corporation, the petitioner was

permitted to establish the food plaza in a portion of the Railway

Station building and that the twelve year period contemplated

in the catering policy is applicable only to bidders who have

been given vacant lands for construction of building for the

purpose of establishing the food plaza.
</p>
<p id="p_4">           4.    A reply affidavit has been filed by the petitioner

to the counter affidavit filed by the Corporation, contending

mainly that the premises handed over to the petitioner for

running the food plaza was though a portion of the Railway

Station building, the petitioner had to demolish the structures

existed there and had to erect a totally new structure spending

approximately Rs.75,00,000/- and therefore, the petitioner and

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">WPC 11977/16                      5</span>




the bidders who have been handed over vacant sites, cannot be

treated differently in so far as the term of the licence is

concerned.
</p>
<p id="p_5">           5.   Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner as

also the learned counsel for the Corporation.

</p><p id="p_6">           6.   It is beyond dispute that the term for which

bids have been invited for establishment of the food plaza is

nine years, renewable by an additional period of three years.

The said term of nine years renewable by an additional period

of three years has been categorically mentioned in the

agreement entered into by the petitioner with the Corporation.

According to the petitioner, in the light of the specific provision

in the catering policy, in so far as the project awarded to them

is a project involving substantial civil construction, the term

specified in the tender document and in the agreement is a

mistake and therefore, they are entitled to run the food plaza

for fifteen years.  According to the Corporation, fifteen year

term is applicable only to projects where vacant lands are given

to successful bidders and in so far as the petitioner has been

given a portion of the Railway Station building, they are not

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">WPC 11977/16                       6</span>




entitled to the benefit of fifteen years.      The short question,

therefore, is whether the term specified in the bid document as

also in the agreement is a mistake and if so, whether the

petitioner is entitled to run the food plaza for a period of fifteen

years in terms of the grant.
</p>
<p id="p_7">           7.    It is seen that it is by virtue of the terms of the

catering policy formulated by the Railway in the year 2000,

projects in the nature of one referred to in the writ petition have

been introduced. It is also seen that the said policy provides for

a longer tenure of twelve years for projects involving

substantial civil constructions.    The fact that all the projects

referred  to   in   the   catering   policy   would   involve   civil

constructions is not in dispute. The petitioner has no case that

there exists any guidelines for categorising projects involving

substantial civil works and projects not involving substantial

civil works. In the absence of any guidelines to distinguish the

projects, the freedom to distinguish the projects has to be

conceded to the Corporation.          As such, in so far as the

Corporation classified the project as a project not involving

substantial civil construction by prescribing a period of nine

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">WPC 11977/16                      7</span>




years for grant of licence, the petitioner is not entitled to

challenge the said specification on any ground whatsoever.

Even if the project is one involving substantial civil construction

and similar projects have been classified so by the Corporation

by prescribing a tenure of twelve years for grant of licence, the

petitioner is not entitled to the benefit of the said longer period

for reasons more than one. First of all, as noted above, bid was

invited for the project only for a period of nine years. It is

conceded by the parties that it is based on the higher turn over

projected by the petitioner and the percentage of licence fee

offered by the petitioner based on the projected sales turn over

for a period of nine years, the bid has been confirmed in favour

of the petitioner. Having obtained the bid for running the food

plaza for a period of nine years, the petitioner cannot claim the

right to conduct the food plaza for an extended period, for, had

such an option been available at the time of invitation of the

bid, it cannot be said that the petitioner would have been the

successful bidder in the bid process. Further, Ext.R4(f) is the

agreement executed by the petitioner in connection with the

conduct of the food plaza. It is categorically stated in Ext.R4(f)

agreement that the petitioner is entitled to run the food plaza

only for a period of nine years, renewable by another period of

three years. The petitioner has been granted a term of twelve

years as per the terms of the contract. Having agreed to run a

food plaza for a period of nine years renewable by another

period of three years, the petitioner cannot be heard to contend

that he is entitled to run the food plaza for a period beyond the

term specified in the contract.
