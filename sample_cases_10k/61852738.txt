</p>
<p id="p_3">      Learned counsel for the applicant submits that the applicant

has been falsely implicated in this case. The liquor has not been

seized from the possession of the applicant. Conclusion of trial is

likely to take time. The applicant is a permanent resident of Bada

Bazar, near takia, Karera, District Shivpuri and there is no

likelihood of his absconsion if released on bail. With the aforesaid

submissions, prayer for grant of bail is made.

three years and that 60 bulk liters of country made liquor has been

seized from the possession of the applicant.

</p><p id="p_6">      Considering the fact that prolonged pre-trial detention is an

anathema to the concept of liberty, this Court is inclined to extend

the benefit of bail to the applicant, but with certain stringent

condition in view of criminal antecedent and nature of offence.

</p><p id="p_7">      Accordingly, without expressing any opinion on merits of the

case, this application is allowed and it is directed that the applicant
