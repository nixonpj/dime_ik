     [Shekhar Halva vs. State of M.P. and others</a>]

9.08.2017
     Shri R.L. Gupta, Advocate for the appellant.
     Shri   A.P.    Singh,   Govt.   Advocate   for   the
respondents/State.</pre>


<p id="p_1">     I.A. No.10124/2017
     There is delay of 2 days in filing the present writ
appeal. For the reasons stated in the application, we
find that sufficient cause is made out for condonation
of delay. Thus the prayer is allowed and the delay is
condoned.
</p>

<p id="p_2">W.A. No.613/2017


     Challenge in the present writ appeal is to an
order passed by the learned Single Judge in W.P.
No.7413/2014 on 18-4-2017 whereby claim of the
petitioner-appellant for the wages from the date he
ought to have been appointed till the date he was
appointed, was declined.
</p><p id="p_3">     The appellant earlier had filed W.P. No.8144/2011
which was allowed on 5-9-2012 and in pursuant to the
direction issued therein the appellant was appointed.
</p><p id="p_4">     Admittedly, there was no direction in the writ
petition that the appellant shall be conferred all
 consequential benefits including the wages from the
date other appointments were made in the selection
process.    In terms of the directions issued, the
respondents have passed an order on 18-02-2013 to
permit the appellant to join duty. Since there was no
order of payment of consequential benefits, therefore,
such benefits were not conferred and the order
impugned in the writ petition was passed by the
respondents on 28-4-2014 in terms of another writ
petition filed by the appellant.
</p><p id="p_5">     The appellant is denied benefit of salary from the
date he ought to have been appointed till the date he
has been appointed, for the reasons that he has not
worked for the said period. Therefore, keeping in view
the principle of 'no work no pay' the appellant is not
entitled to salary, though he has been given the
notional benefit of such period by fixing his seniority
and pay.
</p><p id="p_6">     From a perusal of the records, we find that the
fact remains that the appellant has not worked from
16-8-2011 till the order passed on 18-02-2013. After
his appointment, his pay has been notionally fixed as
he was appointed on 16-8-2011.       The fact is that in
the earlier writ petition preferred by the petitioner-
appellant, there was no direction for payment of
consequential benefits.     Once consequential benefits
were not ordered in the first writ petition filed by the
       appellant, the appellant cannot claim for such benefits
      in a subsequent writ petition.
</p><p id="p_7">            We    find    that     the       reasoning   given   by   the
      authorities in the impugned order dated 28-4-2014
      cannot be termed illegal warranting interference in writ
      jurisdiction of this Court. This Court in the writ petition
      examines the decision-making process and not the
      decision itself.        The decision-making process of the
      respondents does not suffer from any irregularity,
      irrationality      or     illegality     which     may     warrant
      interference in the writ petition. The order passed by
      the learned Single Bench is impeccable and the same
      is not required to be interfered with in this intra-court
      appeal.
</p><p id="p_8">            It is accordingly dismissed.</p><pre id="pre_2">
