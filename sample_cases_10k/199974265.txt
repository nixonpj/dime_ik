     THIS CRIMINAL PETITION COMING ON FOR ORDERS THIS
DAY, THE COURT MADE THE FOLLOWING:
                               2




                           ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">1.   This petition is filed by the petitioner-accused No.1 in

Kerur P.S. Crime No. 170/2017 registered for the offences

punishable u/S 143, 147, 148, 341, 323, 324, 355, 504,

506(2) r/w Sec. 149 of <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_2">IPC</a> r/w Sec. 3(1)(S) of SC/ST (POA)

Act, 1989. Due to apprehension of arrest by the Police, this

bail petition is filed by the petitioner seeking for grant of

anticipatory bail in the event of his arrest by urging various

grounds.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">2.   Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and the

learned SPP for the State and perused the records.


</p><p id="p_4">3.   It is alleged in the complaint that the petitioner being

arrayed as accused No.1 has dashed his tractor against a cat,

that the cat belonged to the complainant, by driving in a rash

and negligent manner, due to the accident the cat died. The

incident had happened for about 20 days back. Due to the

said incident there was an altercation verbally took place

between the complainant and this petitioner-accused and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                  3</span>




there was nursing of grudge against the complainant by this

accused. Therefore, on 14.09.2017 at about 6.30 am when

the complainant was returning to his home after attending

the nature's call, that the accused herein waylaid him and

assaulted him with means of sickle, stones and hands and

also abusing him in filthy language by held his caste, which

wounded his feelings.    It transpires in the complaint which

was filed by the complainant before the Police, based upon

the same, crime was registered and thereafter proceeded with

the case for investigation.
</p>
<p id="p_5">
</p><p id="p_6">4.   Whereas     the   learned       counsel   appearing   for   the

petitioner during the course of his arguments contending that

no direct overt act attributed against the accused for

commission of the offences including life threat. Keeping in

mind the incident which took place 20 days back, the alleged

incident happened on the fateful day but the Police are

making hectic efforts to arrest this petitioner without there

being any reasons to commit the alleged offence as the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                 4</span>




accused did not abuse by held caste of the complainant.

There are no materials find place either in the complaint or in

the FIR which was recorded by the Police.           There is no

materials against the accused to commit the offence that too

to be incorporated in the FIR but the accused who hails from

a respectable family and also having respect in the eye of the

society. Moreover, the accused is ready to abide by any terms

and conditions to be imposed by this Court while granting

bail to him. It is further contended that the co-accused are

already granted with bail. The co-accused and this petitioner

are in the similar footing. But, merely because the axe which

alleged to be used by the petitioner herein and also extending

life threat, it cannot be said that the petitioner shall be denied

of bail. For all these reasons urged by the learned counsel

appearing for the petitioner seeking for bail as sought for.


</p><p id="p_7">5.   Countering the arguments advanced by the learned

counsel for the petitioner and keeping in view the averments

made in the complaint as well as the FIR which is recorded by
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                5</span>




the Police in Crime No. 170/2017 that has to be abusing the

complainant by naming his caste, which wounded the feelings

of the complainant and also the accused picked up quarrel

and so also extending life threat. That the allegations made

in the complaint finds place in the FIR which was recorded by

the Police but the fact that the accused is absconding from

the date of alleged incident, itself is sufficient to hold that

there are prima facie involvement of this petitioner in the

alleged crime. Therefore, the petitioner is not entitled to be

enlarged on bail.   Hence, sought for dismissal of the bail

petition.
</p>
<p id="p_8">
</p><p id="p_9">6.    As stated supra in detail about the contention which

was taken by the learned counsel appearing for the petitioner

and similarly the contention which was taken by the learned

SPP, Crime No. 170/2017 was registered upon the complaint

of the complainant, which was filed keeping in mind the

incident that occurred 20 days back.      In that view of the

matter, there was some verbal altercation took place between
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                  6</span>




the accused and the complainant. Subsequent to registration

of the crime the case is still under investigation which

requires recording the statement of witnesses as well as

securing material documents, drawing mahazar in the

presence of panch witnesses. Therefore, it does not require

any detailed discussion while considering the bail petition.

The apprehension of the learned SPP that if the petitioner

accused is released on bail he would certainly come in the

way of investigation and destroy the evidence, could be

curtailed by imposing suitable conditions.

</p><p id="p_10">       In view of the aforesaid reasons, I pass the following

order.
</p>
<p id="p_11">                             ORDER
