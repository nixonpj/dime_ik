                STATE OF KERALA
                THROUGH THE SUB- INSPECTOR OF POLICE, TALIPARAMBA
                POLICE STATION, REPRESENTED BY THE PUBLIC

THIS BAIL APPLICATION HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON 25.10.2018,
THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING:

                              O R D E R
</pre>

<p id="p_1">         This application is filed under ยง438 of the <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_1">Cr.P.C</a>.

</p><p id="p_2">         2.     The applicant herein is the accused in Crime No.989 of

    2018 of the Thaliparamba Police Station. In the aforesaid crime

    he is being proceeded against for having committed offences

    punishable under ยง379<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_2"> of the Indian Penal Code</a>.
 Bail Appl..No. 6607 of 2018

</p><p id="p_3">         3.    On 19.09.2018, at about 4 pm, the applicant herein

    was found mining river sand from the Kuppam Puzha and was

    seen loading it into a goods autorickshaw bearing Reg. No.KL-13

    S-7791. When an attempt was made to apprehend him by the

    Station House Officer of the Thaliparamba Police Station, the

    applicant is alleged to have taken to his heels.   The vehicle as

    well as the sand were seized.
</p>
<p id="p_4">
</p><p id="p_5">         4.    Heard the learned counsel appearing for the applicant

    as well as the learned Public Prosecutor.


</p><p id="p_6">         5.    I have considered the submissions advanced and have

    gone through the case diary.        The contention of the learned

    counsel that the applicant herein is a prominent leader and that

    he was falsely implicated cannot be accepted as there are

    materials which points to his complicity in the case diary. After

    going through the case records, I am unable to accept the

    contention of the learned counsel that the allegation against the

    applicant are frivolous and vexatious.


</p><p id="p_7">         6.    As has been held by this Court, the ramifications of

    illegal sand mining and the adverse impact that it would have on

    the ecology and the environment are matters of great concern.
 Bail Appl..No. 6607 of 2018

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                     3</span>



    Having regard to the facts and circumstances, I see no reason to

    allow this application. I direct the applicant to surrender before

    the Investigating Officer or the court having jurisdiction and seek

    regular bail. If an application for bail is filed, the same shall be

    considered and orders shall be passed expeditiously and on its

    merits.
