CORAM: HON'BLE MS. JUSTICE JAISHREE THAKUR

Present:    Mr. Amar Sharma, Advocate,
            for the appellant.

                  ****

JAISHREE THAKUR, J. (ORAL)
</pre>
<p id="p_1">1.          This is a first appeal against the order of the Addl. District

Judge, SAS Nagar Mohali dismissing the application filed under <a href="/doc/1722761/" id="a_1">Section 34</a>

of the Arbitration and <a href="/doc/1306164/" id="a_2">Conciliation Act</a> seeking to challenge the award dated

08.04.2016 passed by the Arbitrator.
</p>
<p id="p_2">2.          Admittedly, a dispute had arisen between the appellant and

respondent No.1 which led to the appointment of an Arbitrator in terms of

the Arbitration Agreement. An award dated 08.04.2016 came to be passed

which was to be challenged within the time frame as specified under <a href="/doc/1722761/" id="a_3">Section

34(3)</a> of the Arbitration &amp; <a href="/doc/1306164/" id="a_4">Conciliation Act</a>, 1996, which reads as under :-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">            "34(3)- An application for setting aside may not be made after
            three months have elapsed from the date on which the party
            making that application had received the arbitral award or, if
            a request had been made under Section 33, from the date on
            which that request had been disposed of by the arbitral

             tribunal;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">             Provided that if the Court is satisfied that the applicant was
             prevented by sufficient cause from making the application
             within the said period of three months, it may entertain the
             application within a further period of thirty days, but not
             thereafter."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_3">3.           Admittedly, the objections to the said award were filed under

<a href="/doc/1722761/" id="a_5">Section 34</a> of the Arbitration &amp; <a href="/doc/1306164/" id="a_6">Conciliation Act</a>, 1996 on 25.07.2016 which

is beyond the period of three months as stipulated under <a href="/doc/1722761/" id="a_7">Section 34(3)</a> of the

Act.
</p>
<p id="p_4">4.           If the appellant herein had supported the said petition along

with an application seeking condonation of delay giving adequate reasons,

the appeal would have been within the specified time. However, when the

objections were filed, there was no application filed seeking condonation of

delay, which came to be filed on 19.09.2016, well beyond the period of

three months and additional period of 30 days. The Addl. District Judge,

taking these dates into account, has rightly dismissed the objections petition

on the ground of limitation. Finding no infirmity in the same, this petition is

dismissed without merit.
