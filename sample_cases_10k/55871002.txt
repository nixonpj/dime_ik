                      W.P. No.13201 (W) of 2017
                   M/s. Saltee Technology Pvt. Ltd.
                                 -Vs.-
14.07.17          Joint Commissioner, Service Tax-I,
SL-26              Commissionerate Kolkata &amp; Ors.
Ct-13
(S.R.)   Mr. Aniruddha Chatterjee
         Mr. Srijib Chakraborty              ... for the petitioner.

        Mr. Somnath Ganguli
        Mr. Bhaskar Prosad Banerjee          ... for the State.


              The petitioner assails an order in original dated

        March 28, 2017 disposing of a show-cause notice dated

        September 13, 2015 and the reply thereto.


              Learned advocate for the petitioner submits that,

        although the impugned order is appealable, the petitioner

        is entitled to maintain a writ petition against such order.

        He submits that, the adjudicating authority has acted in

        breach of principles of natural justice in passing the order

        impugned.     The adjudicating authority did not serve

        notice of hearing of the proceedings upon the petitioner.

        He refers to the affidavit-in-opposition and submits that,

        the envelope claimed to be sent to the office of the

        petitioner was not received by the petitioner. He refers to

        the postal endorsement on such envelope and submits

        that, the recording is "intimation served".    He submits
                              2


that, it is preposterous that, the petitioner having

appeared in the matter all throughout and having received

the earlier notices, it would not receive the subsequent

notice. Moreover, the provisions for appeal are illusory,

as the petitioner is required to make a pre-deposit. The

petitioner as an excellent chance of success before the

adjudicating authority itself, in the event, the petitioner is

afforded a chance to appear before the adjudicating

authority and make its case.


      Learned advocate appearing for the respondents</pre>

<p id="p_1">submits that, the provisions of the Central Exercise Act of

1944 are applicable to proceedings under the Service Tax

Act. He refers to the affidavit-in-opposition and submits

that, the notice of hearing was dispatched to the

petitioner by registered post and that, the postal envelope

in respect thereof has come back with the endorsement

"intimation served". The same is good service in view of

Section 37-C of the Central Exercise Act, 1944. He refers

to the Authority for advance Rulings (Central Excise,

Customs and Service Tax) Procedure Regulations, 2005

and submits that, the service is in terms of Regulation 7

thereof.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                              3</span><p id="p_2">


</p><p id="p_3">      In reply, learned advocate for the petitioner submits

that, in every situation, "intimation served" cannot

constitute a good service.       Moreover, service was not

effected in terms of Rule 7(3) of the Regulations of 2005.


</p><p id="p_4">      I have considered the rival contentions of the

parties and the materials made available on record.


</p><p id="p_5">      The petitioner had suffered a show-cause notice

cum demand notice from the Service Tax authority. The

allegation against the petitioner is that, the petitioner

having engaged itself in acquiring, constructing and

transferring rights in respect of Ground plus 14 flours

building was required to register itself for service tax and

pay the same.    It had replied thereto.   The show-cause

notice and the reply thereto stood disposed of by the

impugned order in original.      The impugned order is in

original is appealable. The petitioner, however, seeks to

maintain a writ petition against it on the ground of breach

of principles of natural justice. It claims that it was not

heard.   A writ petition is maintainable notwithstanding

the existence of its statutory alternative remedy, once the

petitioner establishes that, the impugned order suffers

from the defect of jurisdiction or that the impugned order
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                4</span>


was passed in breach of principles of natural justice.


</p><p id="p_6">      In support of the contention that the petitioner was

not heard on January 31, 2017, the petitioner relies upon

the dates of hearing and the notice in respect of the same.

According to the petitioner, it did not receive the notice of

hearing for January 31, 2017. The postal envelope was

returned   to   the    authorities   with   the   endorsement

"intimation served".       Therefore, it cannot constitute a

valid service of notice.
</p>
<p id="p_7">
</p><p id="p_8">      The provisions of <a href="/doc/160890273/" id="a_1">Section 37-C</a> of the Central Excise

Act, 1944 are applicable to service tax. <a href="/doc/160890273/" id="a_2">Section 37-C</a> of

the Central Excise Act, 1944 deals with service of

decisions, orders, summons, etc. it is as follows: -

</p><p id="p_9">       "37-C. Service of decisions, orders, summons,
etc. - (1) any decision or order passed or any summons or
notice issued under this Act or the rules made
thereunder, shall be served, -
</p><p id="p_10">       (a) by tendering the decision, order, summons or
notice, or sending it by registered post with
acknowledgement due [ or by speed post with proof of
delivery or by courier approved by the Central Board of
Excise and Customs Constituted under the <a href="/doc/76600/" id="a_3">Central
Boards of Revenue Act</a>, 1963 (54 of 1963)], to the person
for whom it is intended or his authorised agent, if any;

sub-section (1)] or a copy thereof is affixed in the manner
provided in sub-section (1).]"
</p>
<p id="p_14">
</p><p id="p_15">      In Sub-section 2 of Section 37-C of the Act of 1944,

a summon or notice is deemed to be good service if it is

tendered to the addressee.       There is no dispute as to the

address of the petitioner in the notice for the hearing

dated January 31, 2017.          The petitioner claims not to

have received the same.      However, the authorities are

required to tender the same in accordance with law.         It

has done so. The affidavit-in-opposition establishes that

the notice of the hearing was dispatched to the address of

the   petitioner,   known   to    the   respondents   through

registered post with acknowledgement due.          The postal

envelope came back with the recording "intimation

served". In the facts of the present case, the same has to

be held to be a good service of the notice as it was

tendered at the address of the petitioner.


</p><p id="p_16">      Regulation 7(3) of the Regulations of 2005 requires
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                 6</span>


delivery of notice at the address of the noticee. Regulation

7(3) of the Regulations of 2005 has to be read in the

context of <a href="/doc/48169716/" id="a_4">Section 37-C(2)</a> of the Central Excise Act, 1944.

The word "delivered" used in Regulation 7(3) will bring in

its wake a tender to the addressee should it have been

done in terms of <a href="/doc/48169716/" id="a_5">Section 37-C(2)</a> of the Act of 1944.


</p><p id="p_17">      The impugned order reveals that the hearing of the

show-cause notice was fixed on December 30, 2016,

January 11, 2017 and on January 31, 2017.                The

petitioner did not appear on all of the three dates. The

petitioner was adequate, proper and sufficient notice of

the hearing. It had chosen not to appear. The petitioner

cannot be heard to contend that, the petitioner was not

given the notice of hearing remitting on the breach of the

principles of natural justice.      Requirement of predeposit

for preferring an appeal does not make the appeal

provisions illusory. On the contrary, a petitioner should

not be allowed to circumvent the appeal provisions, dodge

the predeposit and have its rights adjudicated through a

writ petition.
</p>
<p id="p_18">
</p><p id="p_19">      In such circumstances, I am not minded to interfere

in the present writ petition.
