Present :   Mr. Rishu Mahajan, Advocate for the petitioner.

<p id="p_1">            The present petition has been filed under <a href="/doc/1783708/" id="a_1">Section 438</a> of the

Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 for grant of anticipatory bail to petitioner

Gursimranjit Singh in case FIR No.164 dated 27.09.2017 under <a href="/doc/455468/" id="a_2">Sections

307</a>, <a href="/doc/1011035/" id="a_3">323</a>, <a href="/doc/763672/" id="a_4">148</a> and <a href="/doc/999134/" id="a_5">149</a> of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (for short - '<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_6">IPC</a>') and

</p>
<p id="p_2">            Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the petitioner

has falsely been implicated in the case and he has become victim of

conspiracy at the hands of the complainant. The dispute was there between

one Harpal Singh and the complainant. Learned counsel further submits that

as per the allegations in the FIR, the petitioner has been alleged to fire a

shot on the complainant which hit on the right arm of a school going child.

There was no intention to harm the school going child. Another shot was

fired on the complainant, which hit on his left biceps, which is non-vital

part of the body. It was a case of sudden provocation and there was no

intention to kill, attracting <a href="/doc/455468/" id="a_9">Section 307</a> IPC. Learned counsel further

submits that weapon has already been recovered from co-accused Harpal

Singh and nothing is to be recovered from the petitioner. Both the co-

accused of the petitioner have been granted benefit of bail. The petitioner

undertakes to abide by all the terms and conditions to be imposed by this

Court or by the Investigating Officer.
</p>
<p id="p_3">            Heard arguments of learned counsel for the petitioner and I

have also perused the contents of the FIR and other documents on the file.

</p><p id="p_4">            As per allegations in the FIR, complainant Gurwinder Singh

was coming back to his village on motorcycle along with Amanpreet Singh

and on reaching on Adda Bhillowal, where Harpal Singh alias Happy armed

with pistol, Gursimranjit Singh (petitioner) armed with Dang, Amritpal

Singh armed with baseball and Gurjant Singh armed with baseball were

standing on two Bullet motorcycles, at about 11:30 a.m. They were

quarreling with one Gagan Kumar alias Soni who was running a mobile

repairing shop at the Adda. Petitioner got annoyed and took revolver from

Harpal alias Happy and fired shot, which struck on the right arm of school

child namely Navtej Singh, who was standing near Rehari of Golgappa and

fell down. Thereafter, the petitioner again fired a shot on complainant which

hit on his left biceps. The motive behind the occurrence is that the

complainant stopped the above said persons from quarreling with

shopkeeper Gagan Soni and because of that reason they caused injury to

him and school child namely Navtej Singh. Even while leaving the place,

third shot was fired in the air.
</p>
<p id="p_5">              On perusal of the allegations in the FIR as stated above, the

petitioner has fired two shots, one hit the school going child namely Navtej

Singh on his right arm near elbow and the second hit the complainant on his

left biceps. Both the injured remained admitted in Guru Nanak Dev

Hospital, Amritsar and as per the medical record, both the injured received

three injuries each on their persons, which are attributed to the present

petitioner. Although, as per the medical record the injuries received by both

the persons are simple in nature but said injuries could have been dangerous

to life. Petitioner has been shown to be armed with deadly weapon and he

took active participation in the occurrence.
</p>
<p id="p_6">              Accordingly, by seeing nature of offence, active role of the

petitioner and the intention, no ground is made out to release him on

anticipatory bail and, therefore, the present petition being devoid of any

merit is hereby dismissed.
