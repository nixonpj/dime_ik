<p id="p_1">THOTTATHIL B. RADHAKRISHNAN, J.
</p>
<p id="p_2">

</p><p id="p_3">     The 2nd defendant in a suit for specific performance of a

contract for sale is the appellant. He challenges the common

order by which, the court below refused to set aside the ex parte

decree passed against him and also to condone the delay of 146

days in applying for such relief.
</p>
<p id="p_4">

</p><p id="p_5">     2. Alleging that the 1st defendant executed a contract for

sale on 8.10.2005 and pleading that the plaintiff thereafter found

that the 1st defendant had sold the property to the 2nd defendant,

the suit was laid in 2007. The 1st defendant entered appearance.

Summons to the 2nd defendant was taken to his address as

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">F.A.O.188/10                      2</span>


available from the assignment shown to have been made by the

1st defendant to the 2nd defendant.
</p>
<p id="p_6">

</p><p id="p_7">       3. The process server returned it by saying that the 2nd

defendant was not found and that his address could not be

traced out even from the post office.           The court below,

thereafter, issued substituted service by paper publication. That

was carried out in a newspaper.
</p>
<p id="p_8">

</p><p id="p_9">       4. Thereafter, the 1st defendant, going by the materials and

as noticed by the court below even in these proceedings,

seriously contested the litigation on all possible grounds.

Ultimately the suit was decreed on 20.1.2009 overruling the

contentions of the 1st defendant.       Therefore, the factum of

existence of a contract for sale between the plaintiff and the

1st defendant and the legal consequence flowing there from

vis-a-vis those parties are concluded by the judgment as it

stands. The finding that the 1st defendant is obliged to perform

his part of that contract for sale and that the plaintiff is eligible

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">F.A.O.188/10                    3</span>


to get the sale deed executed in terms thereof is also concluded.

The only question that could have survived is whether the

appellant/2nd defendant is a bona fide purchaser for valuable

consideration without notice of the contract for sale and is,

therefore, entitled to avoid specific performance resulting in the

2nd defendant being deprived of the property.



</p><p id="p_10">       5. The plea raised by the appellant/2nd defendant in his

applications to set aside the ex parte decree and to condone

delay, was that the summons was never taken to him and he had

not seen the notice published in the newspaper. He tendered

evidence as PW1. He also produced Exts.A1 and A2 documents

of 2009 and 2010 which were utilized by the petitioner to project

a case that he had not been staying in the address shown in the

plaint.
</p>
<p id="p_11">

</p><p id="p_12">       6. The court below was not impressed by the evidence of

the petitioner as PW1. It came to the conclusion that the story

that he did not know about the pending litigation which was also

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">F.A.O.188/10                       4</span>


in the same court, cannot be believed. The court below relied on

the proviso to Rule 13 of Order IX of the Code of Civil Procedure

to state that the materials disclosed that the decree cannot be

set aside. It took note of the entire facts and circumstances in a

wholesome way in the back drop of the fact that the

petitioner/2nd defendant is an Advocate practicing from 1995

onwards.
</p>
<p id="p_13">

</p><p id="p_14">       7. We are in complete agreement with the finding of the

court below that on the totality of the facts and circumstances,

the irresistible conclusion appears to be that the 2nd defendant

was aware of the litigation.       The common course of human

conduct does not lead to any other conclusion, more particularly

because the contract for sale that the 1st defendant made in

favour of the plaintiff is for a total consideration of around Rs.14

lakhs while the sale deed held out by the plaintiff is only for a

total amount of Rs.1,30,000/-. We are not, as at present, inclined

to accept the suggestion made on behalf of the appellant through

his learned counsel that the entire consideration for the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">F.A.O.188/10                      5</span>


transaction was not reflected in the sale deed in his favour.



</p><p id="p_15">       8. With the aforesaid, all that needs to be examined is

whether the appealing 2nd defendant should be given an

opportunity to place before the court below, his grievances,

namely, as noticed above, that he is a bona fide purchaser for

valuable consideration without notice, provided, he has such a

case. No other issue can be agitated before the court below

since the findings against the 1st defendant cannot be disturbed.



</p><p id="p_16">       9. We accede to the suggestion on behalf of the appellant

that the notice was published in a newspaper that did not have

sufficient circulation to bring the notice to the attention of the

2nd defendant. We also find that the summons issued to the 2nd

defendant was ultimately returned. It is not a case where the

summons was shown to be duly served through the process

server, putting the burden on the 2nd defendant to prove that the

summons was not duly served.        Taking a lenient view in this

regard, we feel that the appeal can be allowed on terms

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">F.A.O.188/10                      6</span>


providing the appellant an opportunity, as stated above.



</p><p id="p_17">       In the result, this appeal is allowed and I.A.Nos.5007 and

5008 of 2009 in O.S.No.65 of 2007 on the file of the Ist Additional

Sub Court, Ernakulam will stand allowed on payment of

Rs.25,000/- as costs payable to the plaintiff by making such

payment to the counsel appearing for him before this Court

within a period of three weeks from now, failing which, this

appeal will stand dismissed. We further order that the setting

aside of the decree, as a result of this judgment would be

confined to the interest of the 2nd defendant in the litigation and

the suit will further proceed only from that stage and the

questions in issue for further trial would be only as indicated

above. It is further ordered that in the event of trial on payment

of costs as ordered above, the amount that the plaintiff has

deposited before the court below would be permitted to be

converted as a Fixed deposit in a bank of his choice and receipt

to be retained before the court below and the court below will

expedite the trial disposal, to complete, at any rate, within a

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">F.A.O.188/10                      7</span>


period of six months from the date of receipt of a copy of this

judgment. It is clarified that this judgment will not stand in the

way of issuing such orders as may be necessary for the proper

trial of the issues arising for decision by summoning the parties

and witnesses even if they have already been examined.
