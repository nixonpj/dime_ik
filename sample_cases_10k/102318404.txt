EXPARTE JUDGMENT:
</p>
<p id="p_5">1        Petitioner   has   filed   the   present   petition     U/S   9   of   the 

Indian  Arbitration  &amp; <a href="/doc/1306164/" id="a_2">Conciliation  Act</a>, 1996  claiming  that  the 

respondent had approached the petitioner bank seeking grant of 

loan for purchase of  vehicle/equipment Tata LPO 1616 bearing 

Chassis   No.   MAT   46129590P22094   and   Engine   No. 

90M62818747.  On the request of the respondent an amount of 

Rs.14,70,000/­   was   sanctioned   as   loan   vide   loan­cum­

hypothecation   agreement   No.OCV017028R1000215952   dated 

21.01.2010.    The respondent  agreed to repay the loan amount 

with   interest   in   47   monthly   installments   of   Rs.40,050/­   each. 

Necessary documents in that regard were claimed to have been 

executed  by the respondent. As per case of the petitioner, the 

petitioner had duly paid the financed amount to the respondent 

and vehicle was under exclusive hypothecation of the petitioner. 

The   respondent   started   defaulting   in   repayment   for   which   a 

demand­cum­termination   notice   dated   11.05.2011   was   sent   to 

the respondent recalling the loan facility.  It was further claimed 

that there existed an arbitration clause in the agreement entered 


(Suit No.549/11)                                                                       (2 of 4)
 into  between  the  parties  and  the  dispute  was  to  be  settled  by 

arbitration.   The petitioner had prayed that Sh. Vikash Kumar, 

authorized   representative   of   the   petitioner   bank   may   be 

appointed   as   Receiver   to   take   into   custody     the   vehicle   in 

question.
</p>
<p id="p_6">2.         Vide order  dated  27.05.2011  passed  by  this  Court,  Sh. 

Vikash Kumar,  authorized representative of the petitioner bank 

was   appointed   as   interim   receiver   to   take   possession   of   the 

vehicle in question.  
</p>
<p id="p_7">3          Notice sent  to the respondent  through  ordinary process 

received back duly served. As none has appeared on behalf of 

respondent, he was proceeded ex­parte.   

</p><p id="p_8">4.       I have heard ld. counsel  for the petitioner and carefully 

gone through the record.
</p>
<p id="p_9">5.       Ld. counsel for the petitioner submitted that vehicle has 

not   been   re­possessed   till   date.     However,   proceedings   for 

Arbitration  have already  been  initiated  and  award has  not  yet 

been passed.  He requested that order of interim receiver may be 

made   effective   till   conclusion   of   proceedings   for   Arbitration. 

The request appears to be reasonable and is allowed.

</p><p id="p_10">6.       Perusal of record reveals that as per Arbitration Clause of 

(Suit No.549/11)                                                                       (3 of 4)
 the Loan Cum Hypothecation Agreement entered into  between 

the parties, all  disputes, differences or claims  arising out of the 

agreement   shall   be   settled   by   arbitration   in   accordance   with 

provisions   of   Arbitration   &amp;   <a href="/doc/1306164/" id="a_3">Conciliation   Act</a>,   1996.   As   per 

provisions of <a href="/doc/1120409/" id="a_4">Section 9</a> of the Arbitration &amp; <a href="/doc/1306164/" id="a_5">Conciliation Act</a>, a 

party   can   approach   the   court     either   before     or     during   the 

arbitration proceedings or at any time after making of the award 

for interim injunction or appointment of a Receiver.

</p><p id="p_11">7.       Accordingly,   the   petition   is   allowed   and   order   dated 

27.05.2011   passed   earlier   is   made   absolute.   As   arbitration 

proceedings   have   already  been   initiated,   the   receiver   shall  be 

duly bound to maintain the vehicle in the same condition   till 

appropriate   order   in   that   regard   is   passed   by   ld.   Arbitrator. 

Petition  stands  disposed  of accordingly.   File be consigned  to 

Record Room.</p><pre id="pre_3">
