</pre>
<p id="p_1">1.      The petitioner management by this writ petition has assailed the
industrial award dated 11.09.2006 made by the Central Government
Industrial Tribunal-cum-Labour Court-II (hereinafter referred to as CGIT),
Rajendra Bhawan, Rajendra Place, New Delhi in I.D. No.37/2003 arising out
of the industrial disputes raised by the respondent workman, which were
referred by the Appropriate Government for adjudication. The terms of
reference read as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">        "1. Whether the demand of the union in relation to equal
        wages for equal work as performed by Shri Ramesh Chander


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">W.P.(C.) No. 894/2007                                            Page 1 of 25</span>
         for performing the work at par with the permanent employees
        for the period w.e.f. 01.04.1986 to 30.09.1988 as Peon and
        w.e.f. 01.10.1988 to 01.09.1996 is just, fair and legal? If yes,
        what relief he is entitled to and from what date.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">        2.    Whether the action of the management of Council for
        Advancement of Pupil's Action and Rural Technology, New
        Delhi in terminating the services of Shri Ramesh Chander, Ex.
        Clerk w.e.f 21.08.1998 during probation period for not obeying
        the lawful order of competent authority, without holding
        domestic inquiry is just, fair and legal? If not, what relief the
        workman is entitled to and from what date."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_2">2.      The CGIT by the impugned award answered the points of reference in
favour of the respondent workman. In the claim statement filed by the
respondent, he stated that he was initially employed as a Peon on daily
wages w.e.f. 01.04.1986 and worked in that capacity up to 30.09.1988.
Thereafter he was again appointed to the post of L.D.C. on daily wages
w.e.f. 01.10.1988. The petitioner was issued the appointment letter dated
20.06.1996 appointing him to the post of L.D.C. and his services were
regularized as L.D.C. w.e.f. 02.09.1996 in the pay scale of Rs.950-20-1150-
EB-25-1500.             This letter of appointment stated that the appointment was
offered against a post sanctioned for the North Zone Regional Committee,
Jaipur of the petitioner Council for Advancement of People‟s Action and
Rural Technology (CAPART). The appointment memorandum contained,
inter alia, the following clause:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">        "2.     The appointment is subject to the following conditions:-
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">        (i)     The appointee will be on probation for a period of two
                years which will be extended at the discretion of the
                competent authority. If no orders are passed by the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">W.P.(C.) No. 894/2007                                                    Page 2 of 25</span>
                 competent authority on expiry of the said period of two
                years, the period of probation shall be deemed to have
                been extended till such time as specific orders are passed
                in this regard. During the probation, he will be required
                to undergo such training etc. as may be considered
                necessary, as part of duty. The appointing authority,
                however, reserves the right of terminating the service of
                the appointee forthwith or before the expiry of notice
                period by making payment to the appointee a sum
                equivalent to the pay and allowances for the period of
                notice or the unexpired portion thereof."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_3">3.      The respondent claimed that the appointment to the post of L.D.C. was
of regular nature.
</p>
<p id="p_4">4.      The respondent further submitted that he was directed to put up two
files mentioned in the communication dated 07.01.1998 issued by the
petitioner management, failing which he was threatened that he would be
suspended and disciplinary action would be initiated against him. He further
claimed that without issuing any charge-sheet or conducting any inquiry,
vide order dated 14.08.1998, his services were terminated with effect from
21.08.1998.       The respondent claimed the order of termination to be a
camouflage. It was claimed that the termination was, in fact, penal though
on the face of it, the same appeared to be innocuous. He further claimed that
one Sh. Rajender Kumar, Research Assistant, who was also terminated at the
same time, was eventually taken back into service as his termination was set
aside in a departmental appeal.        But the respondent was denied similar
treatment. The respondent, therefore, alleged discriminatory treatment at the
hands of the petitioner. He claimed that though he had served continuously
from 1.4.1986 to 30.09.1988 as Peon, and thereafter as L.D.C. from


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">W.P.(C.) No. 894/2007                                                  Page 3 of 25</span>
 01.10.1988 to 01.09.1996, whereafter his services were also regularized in
the same position from 02.09.1996, his services were terminated on
21.08.1998 without one month‟s notice or one month‟s pay in lieu of notice
and he was also not paid any compensation, gratuity etc. As aforesaid, the
termination was not preceded by any domestic enquiry. Consequently, the
respondent claimed that the termination of his services was illegal,
unjustified and unfair. He claimed regularization of his services from the
date another daily wager/LDC Shri Gulshan Chadha, junior to him, was
regularized, i.e., 01.09.1994. As is evident from the terms of reference, he
also claimed equal wages at par with permanent employees for the period
01.04.1986 to 30.09.1988 as Peon, and w.e.f. 01.10.1988 to 01.09.1996 as
L.D.C. He placed reliance on office memorandum issued by the Ministry of
Personnel, Public Grievance and Pension, Department of Personnel &amp;
Training, Government of India, dated 07.06.1988 to claim that daily rated
workers were also entitled to the wages equivalent to their regular counter
parts.
</p>
<p id="p_5">5.       In their written statement, the petitioner management claimed that
termination of the respondent‟s services was in accordance with the terms of
his services contained in para 2(i) of his appointment letter dated 26.06.1996.
It was claimed that though the termination was on account of unsatisfactory
service and negligence on the part of the respondent, the termination order
was innocuous and was not penal in nature. The respondent contended that
the services of probationer may be terminated during probation if his
performance is not satisfactory prior to the expiry of the period of probation.
So far as the respondent‟s claim for parity in pay scale with his counterparts-
</p>


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">W.P.(C.) No. 894/2007                                                Page 4 of 25</span>
<p id="p_6"> who were permanent employees of the petitioner, was concerned, reliance
was placed on legal pronouncements to submit that a daily wager cannot
claim parity of pay with regular employees even if the work performed by
them is identical. The petitioner also set out the act of misconduct/negligence
attributed to the respondent and also led evidence on this aspect to justify the
termination of the respondent‟s services. The petitioner claimed that the
respondent was sent a cheque on 14.01.2002 in lieu of one month‟s notice
pay on 15.01.2002, which was returned by him vide letter dated 17.01.2002
to the petitioner.      The petitioner also sought to distinguish the case of
Rajender Kumar, Research Assistant, on the ground that the termination was
for different reasons and, consequently, the two cases could not be
compared.
</p>
<p id="p_7">6.      After recording evidence the issues for determination were taken up
for consideration - the first being with regard to the respondent‟s claim for
equal wages with his permanent counterparts. In this regard, the Industrial
Adjudicator took note of the decision cited by the petitioner reported as State
of Orissa &amp; Others Vs. Balaram Sahu &amp; Others, 2003 SCC (L&amp;S) 65.
This decision had been rendered by following the earlier decision of the
Supreme Court in State of Haryana Vs. Jasmer Singh, (1996) 11 SCC 77.
The Supreme Court had disallowed the claim of equal pay for equal work
made by the NMR workers as it was claimed by the State that the duties &amp;
responsibilities of the employees in regular establishment were more onerous
than those of NMR workers who were employed in various projects on daily
basis. While disregarding the aforesaid decision, the Industrial Adjudicator
has placed reliance on a three-judge bench of the Supreme Court in



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">W.P.(C.) No. 894/2007                                                 Page 5 of 25</span>
 Bhagwati Prasad Vs. Delhi State Mineral Development Corporation, 1990
1 L.L.J. 320. The Industrial Adjudicator has also referred to the statement
made by the petitioner‟s witness MW-1 in support of his decision.
</p>
<p id="p_8">7.      On the second issue-with regard to the termination being legal or
illegal, the learned Industrial Adjudicator returned a finding in favour of the
petitioner that the termination order is not stigmatic. It was also held that the
services of the respondent were terminated within the period of probation of
two years and that no inquiry was needed in case termination was stigmatic
or punitive. However, the Industrial Adjudicator decided the said issue
against the petitioner management since the petitioner had not paid one
month‟s salary at the time of termination of the respondent‟s services in view
of Clause 12(i) of the Service Bye-Laws, which read thus:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">        "(i) The appointee will be on probation for a period of two
        years which will be extended at the discretion of the competent
        authority. If no orders are passed by the competent authority
        on expiry of the said period of two years, the period of
        probation shall be deemed to have been extended till such time
        as specific orders are passed in this regard. During the
        probation, he will be required to undergo such training etc. as
        may be considered necessary, as part of duty. The appointing
        authority, however, reserves the right of terminating the
        services of the appointee forthwith or before the expiry of
        notice period by making payment to the appointee a sum of
        equivalent to the pay and allowances for the period of notice or
        the unexpired portion thereof."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_9">8.      The Industrial Adjudicator also referred to the case of Sh. Rajender
Kumar, who had been similarly terminated without payment of the salary
and compensation for the termination period and had been reinstated on a


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">W.P.(C.) No. 894/2007                                                  Page 6 of 25</span>
 departmental appeal. Since the respondent had served the petitioner for 12
years earlier as Peon and thereafter as L.D.C., he was held entitled for 25%
back wages along with consequential benefits and continuity of service.
</p>
<p id="p_10">9.      The submissions of Mr. Rungta, learned senior counsel for the
petitioner, in relation to the award made on the first point of reference are
that the approach of the learned Industrial Adjudicator in disregarding the
decision cited by the petitioner in the case of Balram Sahu (supra), by
placing reliance on an earlier decision of the Supreme Court in Bhagwati
Prasad (supra) was laconic. He submits that in Balram Sahu (supra), the
Supreme Court had applied the earlier decision in Jasmer Singh (supra),
wherein the Supreme Court had held that the persons employed on daily
wages could not be treated at part with persons regularly appointed. Daily
rated workers are not required to possess qualification prescribed for regular
workers nor were they required to fulfill the requirement relating to age at
the time of recruitment. They are not selected in the manner in which the
regular employees are selected. Consequently, the requirements of selection
are not as rigorous.    A regularly appointed person is also liable to be
transferred and be subjected to disciplinary action by the authorities, to
which the daily rated workers are not. In Balram Sahu (supra), reliance was
placed by the respondent workman on a three-judge bench decision of the
Supreme Court in Chief Conservator of Forests Vs. Jagannath Maruti
Kondhare (1996) 2 SCC 293 in support of their claim for equal pay for equal
work. The Supreme Court, however, rejected the workman‟s submission
founded upon that decision in paragraphs 13 &amp; 14, which read as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">        "13. On a careful consideration of the materials placed on


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">W.P.(C.) No. 894/2007                                               Page 7 of 25</span>
         record, we are of the view that the principles firmly laid down
        in the well-considered decision of Jasmer Singh [(1996) 11
        SCC 77 : 1997 SCC (L&amp;S) 210] squarely applied on all fours
        to the cases on hand and the respondent workers would be
        entitled to only, apart from the regularization order for which
        the appellants have had no serious objections, the payment of
        minimum wage prescribed for such workers if it is more than
        what they were being paid and that the High Court was in
        serious error in directing that the respondents should be paid
        the same salary and allowances as were being paid to the
        regular employees holding similar posts. The respondent
        workers cannot be held to hold any posts to claim even any
        comparison with the regular and permanent staff, for any or
        all purposes including a claim for equal pay and allowances.
        The fact that no materials were placed before the High Court as
        to the nature of duties of either categories should have been
        viewed as a disentitling factor so far as the workers are
        concerned and dissuaded the High Court from embarking upon
        an inquiry in the abstract and with no factual basis and not to
        empower the court to assume and presume equality in the
        absence of proof to the contra or of any unequal nature of the
        work performed by them. To claim a relief on the basis of
        equality, it is for the claimants to substantiate a clear-cut basis
        of equivalence and a resultant hostile discrimination before
        becoming eligible to claim rights on a par with the other group
        vis-à-vis an alleged discrimination. In the light of the decision
        directly on this issue rendered in Jasmer Singh [(1996) 11 SCC
        77 : 1997 SCC (L&amp;S) 210] we are unable to persuade ourselves
        to countenance the claim for minimum basic salary given in
        some unreported decisions brought to our notice which appear
        on the face of it to be certain directions given on the peculiar
        facts and circumstances of the same without an objective
        consideration of any principle of law. An order made to merely
        dispose of the case before court by issuing certain directions on
        the facts and for the purposes of the said case, cannot have the
        value or effect of any binding precedent and particularly in the
        teeth of the decision in Jasmer Singh case [(1996) 11 SCC 77 :
        1997 SCC (L&amp;S) 210] .

submits that the finding retuned by the Tribunal is in favour of the petitioner
that the termination was made during the period of probation, and was non-
stigmatic.     However, the reference has been answered in favour of the
respondent and the termination has been held to be illegal only on account of
the fact that payment of one month‟s salary in lieu of notice period has not
been made in terms of Section 12(1) of the Service Bye-Laws quoted above,
simultaneously at the time of termination of the respondent‟s services.
</p>
<p id="p_14">13.     Mr. Rungta submits that the mere failure to make payment of the

<p id="p_15">14.     In support of his submission Mr. Rungta has placed reliance on
Oriental Insurance Company Limited Vs. T. Mohammed Raisuli Hassan,
(1993) 1 SC 553, wherein the Supreme Court held as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_14">        "5. When the above term in the clause relating to the condition
        of service of the respondent with the appellant is seen as a
        whole, there is nothing to indicate or suggest, even remotely,
        that non-service of one month's notice as a condition precedent
        for termination of the respondent's service would result in
        vitiation or invalidation of termination, if effected. On the
        contrary, the second part of the term contained in the clause,
        "breach of this condition, will entitle the company to recover
        from you one month's salary in lieu of notice" makes it obvious
        that the same would be the consequence if there was a breach
        of condition on the part of the company in the matter of service
        of one month's notice before termination of the respondent's
        service. Hence, we are constrained to hold that the non-service
        of one month's notice in writing by the appellant to the
        respondent before terminating the latter's service did not
        invalidate or vitiate such termination. From this, it follows that
        courts below had misread the said clause, by which either party
        was required to serve notice for putting an end to service of the
        respondent and consequently committed an apparent error in
        taking the view that non-service of one month's prior notice to
        the respondent had vitiated the termination of his service.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_16">15.     He also places reliance on the judgment of the learned Single Judge of
the Andhra Pradesh High Court in P. Usha Radhey Mohan Vs. M.V. Ramu,
Manager (Personnel) CMC, Hyderabad, 1998 LawSuit (AP) 4, decided on


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">W.P.(C.) No. 894/2007                                                  Page 11 of 25</span>
 01.01.1998. In this case, the Andhra Pradesh High Court placed reliance on
the decision of the Supreme Court in Oriental Insurance (supra) and
observed as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_15">        "5. The Supreme Court took the same view in <a href="/doc/1010226/" id="a_1">Oriental
        Insurance Co. Ltd. v. T. Mohammed Raisuli Hassan</a>, 1982 FJR
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_16">        242. The Supreme Court held that there was nothing to
        indicate or suggest, even remotely, that the non service of one
        month's notice as a condition precedent for termination of the
        employee's service would result in vitiation or invalidation of
        the termination. Service of such notice as a condition
        precedent to terminating the service of the employee is not a
        mandatory requirement so that the breach of the same could
        result in vitiation of that termination. The Supreme Court
        further observed that the non service of one month's notice
        before termination of the employees service would, at the most,
        entitle him to claim one month's salary in lieu thereof and
        nothing else."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_17">16.     On the other hand, the submission of learned counsel for the
respondent is that so far as the finding of the first issue/reference is
concerned, the same is not premised only on the judgment of the Supreme
Court in Bhagwati Prasad (supra). He submits that in the cross-examination
of the petitioner‟s witness, the said witness had admitted that "at the time of
daily wagers were performing duties in our establishment they were allowed
to the payments and other benefits as per the instruction of Central
Government".
</p>
<p id="p_18">17.     Learned counsel for the respondent has also sought to place reliance
on the Office Memorandum dated 21.10.1990 issued by the Directorate
General of Works, CPWD, Government of India, in pursuance of the

 Supreme Court judgment in the case of Surinder Singh &amp; Anr. Vs.
Engineer-in-Chief, CPWD &amp; Others (1986) 1 SCC 639 decided on
17.01.1986, whereby the method of calculation of wages of daily rated
workers was provided. This memorandum provided that the total monthly
emoluments admissible to regular counterparts of the daily rated workers, at
the minimum of the respective scale of pay, may be multiplied by the
number of days in a particular month after deducting therefrom the days of
absence plus the days of rest falling in the week/weeks in which the worker
remained absent and the result may be divided by number of days in the
month. The figure so arrived at will be the daily rate of wages for the
worker.

<p id="p_19">18.     So far as the second aspect is concerned, i.e., with regard to the
respondents termination, learned counsel for the respondent submits that the
petitioners have not even raised the challenge to the finding of the Industrial
Adjudicator in favour of the respondent on the ground of discrimination.
Learned counsel submits that the case of Rajender Kumar, who was
identically placed with the respondent, has not been disputed by the
petitioner. He has also tendered in Court the copy of the memorandum dated
04.09.1998 issued to Sh. Rajender Kumar, terminating his services while he
was on probation and the order passed in the appeal preferred by him to the
Chairman, EC, CAPART on 25.05.2000.             In this order, the Chairman
observed as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_17">        "WHEREAS the appeal has been considered by the Chairman,
        CAPART vis a vis provision of Bye-Law 12(1) and (2) (ii) and

        therefrom that it is mandatory to give one month's notice or

          payment of such period as the notice falls short of one month
         before terminating of services. The said stipulation of the Bye-
         Laws and terms of appointment letter has not been complied
         with in the instant case and to that extent the order of
         termination could be construed to be in contravention of the
         Bye-Laws and the stipulation of the appointment letter.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_18">         NOW THEREFORE, the Chairman, CAPART hereby accepts
         the appeal preferred by Shri Rajendra Kumar and directs his

         of his re-joining the service in CAPART. The intermittent
         period between the date of termination of his services and his
         re-joining the services will be treated as dies non and will not
         count for any purpose for the service rendered in CAPART. It
         is further ordered that his period of probation could be
         extended if considered necessary."

<p id="p_20">19.      He further submits that the appointment order in respect of the
respondent was issued on 26.06.1996, whereas his termination has taken
place on 14.08.1998, i.e., after two years of service in probation. He submits
that the termination was, therefore, beyond the period of probation of two
years.     Learned counsel further submits that in cross-examination the
petitioner‟s witness had admitted that the termination of the respondent was
based on misconduct. He submits that the same was, therefore, punitive.
</p>
<p id="p_21">20.      The next submission of the learned counsel for the respondent is that,
in any event, the respondent was entitled to protection under <a href="/doc/1056316/" id="a_2">Section 25-F</a> of
the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 (hereinafter referred to as the Act) since he
had continuously been serving for 12 years-earlier as a Peon and thereafter
as L.D.C.       He submits that even a probationer is entitled to protection
available to a workman under the Act, as a probationer is also a workman.

simultaneously in terms of <a href="/doc/1056316/" id="a_5">Section 25-F</a> (a) &amp; (b) would be null &amp; void. In
this regard, he has placed reliance on the decision of Division Bench of this
Court in Delhi Cantonment Board Vs. Central Government Industrial
Tribunal &amp; Others, 2006 (88) DRJ 75 (DB), wherein the Division Bench has
observed:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_19">    "4. Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the
    respondents were on probation and hence their services could be
    terminated without enquiry. In our opinion, the basic flaw in this
    argument is that it relies on a principle of service law, whereas we
    are concerned with industrial law. The principle of one branch of
    law cannot be automatically applied in another branch.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_20">    5. In service law there is an important difference between a
    temporary employee and a permanent employee. A permanent
    employee has a right to the post whereas a temporary employee
    does not, vide <a href="/doc/1489350/" id="a_6">State of U.P. v. Kaushal Kishore Shukla</a>:

        justification for not sending the demand draft by post

<p id="p_24"> 24.      Mr. Rungta submits that in Devender Singh (supra) relied upon by the
respondent, the Supreme Court had not permitted the respondent employer to
raise the plea that the action is covered by <a href="/doc/1418464/" id="a_46">Section 2(oo)</a> because no material
was produced by the employer to show that the engagement of the appellant
workman was discontinued by relying upon the terms &amp; conditions of the
employment.
</p>
<p id="p_25">25.      So far as the petitioner‟s grievance in relation to the adjudication on
the first point of reference is concerned, I find that there is merit in the same.
It is now well-settled that a workman appointed and working as a casual
worker/daily wager de hors the recruitment rules, for which no regular
vacancy exists, cannot claim parity of pay with his regular counterparts.
</p>
<p id="p_26">26.      The submission of Mr. Rungta that the Industrial Adjudicator erred in
not following judgment of the Supreme Court in Balram Sahu (supra) and,
instead, relied upon Bhagwati Prasad (supra) is well founded. In Balram
Sahu (supra), the Supreme Court had relied upon its earlier decision in
Jasmer Singh (supra), wherein the distinction between persons employed on
daily wages and those regularly appointed was clearly brought out. The
nature     of    their   engagement;    responsibilities,   age,   qualifications,
accountability, rights and; obligations differ substantially. The Constitution
Bench in Umadevi (supra) placed the matter absolutely beyond any doubt in
this respect. Consequently, merely because the casual worker/daily wager
may be performing what seem like the same job as the regular counterpart,
he would not become entitled to receive pay as payable to the regular
workman.

<p id="p_27"> 27.     At the same time, the Director General of Works, CPWD,
Government of India has issued the memorandum dated 21.10.1990 in
pursuance of the decision of the Supreme Court in Surinder Singh (supra).
The petitioner CAPART is a society under the aegis of Ministry of Rural
Development, Government of India.         The aforesaid memorandum dated
21.10.1990 issued by the Government of India in respect of the Directorate
General of Works, CPWD would get attracted to the petitioner as the
petitioner just like the CPWD are two different wings of the same body, i.e.,
the Government of India. The respondent, in my view, be entitled to be paid
wages in terms of the said office memorandum dated 21.10.1990. This
memorandum stipulates:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_36">        "The total monthly emoluments admissible to regular
        counterparts of the daily rated workers at the minimum of the
        respective scale of pay may be multiplied by number of days in
        a particular month after deducting therefrom the days of
        absence plus the days of rest falling in the week/weeks in which
        the worker remained absent and the result may be divided by
        number of days in the month. The figure so arrived will be the
        daily rate of wages of the worker."

<p id="p_28">The impugned award in respect of the first term of reference stands modified
to that extent.
</p>
<p id="p_29">28.     The respondent was initially appointed as a Peon on daily wages w.e.f.
01.04.1986 and worked in that capacity till 30.09.1988. Thereafter, he was
appointed to the post of L.D.C. on daily wages w.e.f. 01.10.1988. Vide
appointment letter dated 20.06.1996, he was regularly appointed as LDC
w.e.f. 02.09.1996 in the relevant pay scale. Merely because the petitioner
made the respondent‟s appointment to the post of LDC on probation, it


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">W.P.(C.) No. 894/2007                                               Page 21 of 25</span>
 would not mean that the respondent could, firstly, be continued in probation
for an indefinite period and, secondly, even if his probation was continued
indefinitely, and his services were found to be unsatisfactory, his services
could have been terminated without compliance of <a href="/doc/1056316/" id="a_47">Sections 25-F</a> &amp; <a href="/doc/41851/" id="a_48">25-G</a>.
In any event, he would, in that eventuality, be entitled to revert to his
original position as a Peon.
</p>
<p id="p_30">29.     The submission of Mr. Rungta that because the respondent was a
probationer, his services could be dispensed with any time, cannot be
accepted in absolute terms. The right vested in the respondent on account of
his having worked for more than 240 days initially as a Peon between
01.04.1986 to 30.09.1988 and, thereafter, as LDC w.e.f. 01.10.1988 till the
date of his termination, in a calendar year and in the year preceding his
termination, by virtue of <a href="/doc/1056316/" id="a_49">Section 25-F</a> could not be taken away merely on
account of the fact that the respondent was a probationer. Pertinently, the
so-called probation of the respondent continued from 02.09.1996 till the date
of his termination, i.e., 14.08.1998.     In all, the respondent served the
petitioner for a period of about 12 years - initially as a Peon and, thereafter,
as LDC.       I agree with learned counsel for the respondent that even a
probationer is a workman under the Act. This is clear from the various
decisions cited by the respondent including the decision of the Division
Bench in Delhi Cantonment Board (supra).
</p>
<p id="p_31">30.     The submission of Mr. Rungta that the failure to make payment of the
notice pay/compensation at the time of termination would not be fatal to the
termination order, also has no merit. The decision in T. Mohammed Raisuli
Hassan (supra) was rendered by the Supreme Court in the context of a


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">W.P.(C.) No. 894/2007                                                Page 22 of 25</span>
 materially differently worded clause. The clause considered by the Supreme
Court, in terms, provided that "breach of this condition will entitle the
company to recover from you one month's salary in lieu of notice", which
made it obvious that the same would be the consequence, if there was a
breach of condition on the part of the company in the matter of service of
one month‟s notice before termination of the respondent‟s service.
However, in the present case, bye-law 13(i) extracted above, does not state
that the failure to give one month‟s notice or pay in lieu thereof would not
invalidate the order of termination of the probation. On the other hand,
Anoop Sharma (supra) while taking note of various earlier decisions re-
emphasises the legal position that <a href="/doc/1056316/" id="a_50">Sections 25-F</a> (a) &amp; (b) of the Act are
mandatory and non-compliance thereof would render the retrenchment of an
employee a nullity. To the same effect is the judgment in Devinder Singh
(supra).
</p>
<p id="p_32">31.     I cannot permit the petitioner to raise, at this stage, a submission that
the petitioner is not an industry. No such submission was raised before the
Labour Court. The Labour Court has not examined the said issue on the
basis of the evidence that the parties may have led, had the issue been raised.
</p>
<p id="p_33">32.     The submission that the termination of the respondent falls within
<a href="/doc/1418464/" id="a_51">Section 2(oo)(bb)</a> of the Act also has no merit. The said provision excludes
from the realm of "retrenchment" the termination of the services of the
workman as a result of non-renewal of contract of employment between the
employer and the workman on its expiry, or of such contract being
terminated under a stipulation in that behalf contained therein. In the present
case, <a href="/doc/1418464/" id="a_52">section 2(oo)(bb)</a> is not applicable because the contract of employment


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">W.P.(C.) No. 894/2007                                                 Page 23 of 25</span>
 was not a fixed term contract.
</p>
<p id="p_34">33.     The termination of the respondent‟s services by resort to Clause 2(i) of
the memorandum dated 26.06.1996 is not an order since the memorandum
dated 14.08.1998 terminating the respondent‟s services did not comply with
the condition prescribed in Clause 2(i) of the memorandum dated
26.06.1996, i.e., "by making payment to the appointee a sum equivalent to
the pay &amp; allowances for the period of notice or unexpired portion thereof".
</p>
<p id="p_35">34.     The petitioner has not been able to establish before the Labour Court
that it had sent the notice pay to the respondent contemporaneously with the
termination notice. The Labour Court has returned a finding of fact in this
respect and has also held that the cheque was sent to the respondent
workman in 2002, which was then received by him. Since the notice pay
was not sent to the respondent along with the termination order, the said
termination order was, obviously, bad as the bye-law did not give leeway to
the petitioner to send the notice pay on a subsequent date and did not save
the termination order sent without a notice pay from invalidity.
</p>
<p id="p_36">35.     I also find merit in the submission of the respondent that the petitioner
has not been able to explain the discriminatory treatment meted out to the
respondent in comparison with Sh. Rajinder Kumar, whose case was
identically situated as that of the petitioner.       In fact, in the case of
Sh.Rajinder Kumar the petitioner admitted that the termination order, of the
kind issued to the respondent, was illegal as it is mandatory to give one
month‟s notice or payment for such period of notice under bye-law 12(i) and
12(2) (2).
