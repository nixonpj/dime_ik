 IN THE HIGH COURT OF PUNJAB &amp; HARYANA AT CHANDIGARH

                                                    FAO No. 1176 of 1999 (O&amp;M)

CORAM: HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE SURINDER GUPTA

Present:       Mr. V. Ramswaroop, Advocate
               for the appellant.
               Mr. Jagdish Manchanda, Advocate
               for respondent no. 1.

Surinder Gupta, J.
</pre>
<p id="p_1">               This is appeal by United India Insurance Co. Ltd against award

dated 24.11.1998 passed by Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Faridabad

(later referred to as 'the Tribunal') in MACT Case No. 177 of 26.02.1993,

awarding compensation of `3,19,000/- in respect of injuries suffered by

respondent no. 1-claimant Sanjay Solanki in a motor vehicle accident with

truck bearing registration no. HRC-4107 (later referred to as 'the offending

vehicle').
</p>
<p id="p_2">2.             Learned counsel for the appellant has assailed the award on two

counts, firstly, that the accident was caused due to contributory negligence

of claimant; and secondly, the compensation awarded by Tribunal is on

higher side.
</p>
<p id="p_3">3.             Claimant has given brief description of accident in para 24 of

claim petition, which reads as follows:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">               "24. That the petitioner was coming from Badkhal Road, and

                      going to B.K. (sic hospital) side and when he reached at

                      4/5 Chowk, NIT Faridabad, on his Yamaha Motorcycle

                   No. HR-29-2939, and he crossed the said chowk, in the

                   meantime, a truck bearing no. HRC-4107 came from the

                   backside i.e. from Railway Road, NIT Faridabad without

                   giving any horn, being driven by the respondent no. 1

                   rashly and negligently, at a very high speed, and hit the

                   motorcycle of the petitioner, resulting which the

                   petitioner fell down on the road and received injuries.

                   The said accident was witnessed by Dev Parkash

                   Aggarwal. The detailed description of the said accident

                   has been mentioned in the FIR No. 672 dated 23.10.1992,

                   which may be read as part of this petition."

</blockquote><p id="p_4">4.           Respondent no. 2-Ram Sharan, who was allegedly driving the

offending vehicle at the time of accident, filed written statement, wherein he

denied the accident. Appellant-Insurance Company in its reply took the plea

that claimant was driving his Yamaha Scooter carelessly, negligently and

recklessly at the time of accident, which was caused due to contributory

negligence of claimant himself. Respondent no. 2-Ghansham Dass (since

deceased) before the Tribunal in his separate written statement also denied

the accident. Dev Parkash, who lodged FIR No. 672 dated 23.10.1992

regarding this accident, stated in his statement to police that the offending

vehicle came from the railway road side in a very rash and negligent manner

and hit the vehicle of claimant as a result of which he (claimant) fell down

and suffered injuries.
</p>
<p id="p_5">5.           PW-1 Man Singh was examined as eye-witness of the accident,

who described the accident in following words:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">                   "On 23.10.1992, I was going on foot from my home

             situated in Sanjay colony towards NH Market No. 5, Faridabad.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4"> FAO No. 1176 of 1999                                            -3-</span>


            When I reached on the crossing of No. 4 and 5, I saw that

            Sanjay Solanky was going from the side of B.K. Hospital on his

            motorcycle and was taking a turn towards Badkhal side, in the

            meanwhile, a truck No. HRC-4107 came from the other side

            and hit the motorcycle from the back side. As a result of this

            accident, Sanjay Solanky came under the truck. In fact, the

            truck crushed Sanjay Solanky. The truck was being driven

            rashly or negligently by Ram Saran respondent and without

            blowing any horn. The petitioner Sanjay sustained multiple

            injuries on the hip, stomach, and both the legs including

            fractures. This accident took place at about 1.00 p.m. The truck

            driver after causing the accident had fled away after leaving the

            truck there. I saw this accident with my own eyes. I knew

            Sanjay Solanky from the very beginning. I removed Sanjay

            Solanky to the B.K. Hospital and admitted him there. Police

            had enquired me about this accident?
</blockquote>
<p id="p_6">6.          Claimant while appearing as PW-2 has stated that on the fateful

day, he was coming from chowk of Sectors 4 and 5, NIT, Faridabad, when

the offending vehicle came from behind and hit against his motorcycle.

Statement of claimant and eye-witness is un-rebutted.          Driver of the

offending vehicle has not been examined to give his own version of the

accident. Relying on un-rebutted statements of claimant and eye-witness,

the Tribunal has committed no error while observing that the accident was

caused due to rash and negligent driving of the offending vehicle by its

driver. Findings of the Tribunal on issue no. 1, as such, are affirmed.

</p><p id="p_7">7.          On the issue of quantum, learned counsel for the appellant has

argued that medical bills produced by claimant were not duly approved by
                               3 of 5
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">            ::: Downloaded on - 04-03-2018 16:00:17 :::</span>

calling the concerned doctor, who prescribed the medicines or by examining

the chemist, who had issued those bills. He has further argued that disability

certificate of claimant was also not duly proved and the Tribunal has

committed error while allowing compensation on this score. The Tribunal

has computed compensation awarded to claimant as follows:-

</p><pre id="pre_2">     Sr.                        Heads                         Calculation
     No.
     (i)   Medical expenses actually incurred by              `169000
           petitioner and to make it round figure as
     (ii) Past and future mental agony pain and               `100000
          sufferings and on account of permanent
          disability/injuries to the extent of 55%
</pre><p id="p_8">     (iii) Loss of career, special diet and transportation `50000
           etc.
</p><p id="p_9">                             Total                            `319000

</p><p id="p_10">8.           Though, doctor who issued the disability certificate has not

been examined but no objection was raised by learned counsel for appellant-

Insurance Company, when this document was tendered in evidence.

Disability certificate of claimant has been issued by doctors of Safdarjung

Hosptial, New Delhi. 50% disability was relating to his right lower limb and

the amount of compensation on this score is not on higher side. Even

otherwise, there is no rebuttal to statement of claimant that after the accident

on 23.10.1992, he lost his consciousness and was taken to B.K. Hospital

from where he was referred to Safdarjung Hospital, New Delhi on

24.10.1992, where he remained admitted for about three months and again

for 4 ½ months. Third time he was again admitted in Sardarjung Hospital,

New Delhi for treatment of his injuries and he remained admitted for about

seven months. The claimant has though placed on record bills of more

amount than as allowed by the Tribunal, proforma invoice of Femoral Stem

(with HP coated), Acetabular Head, Acetabular Cup and Acetabular Insert

                               4 of 5

(within 5 spikes) of `77,000/- was also placed on record. However, the

Tribunal has considered the bills issued by hospital and medical agencies

only. The Tribunal allowed compensation of `50,000/- towards loss of

career, special diet and transportation etc. but has not allowed any

compensation towards loss of income, loss of future prospects, loss of

amenities of life, loss of marriage prospects, expenses of attendant, future

medical expenses etc. When the loss suffered by claimant on these scores is

looked into, compensation of 3,19,000/- as allowed by the Tribunal seems to

be not on higher side.
</p>
<p id="p_11">9.          Here learned counsel for respondent no. 1 has argued that if this

Court feels that compensation awarded to claimant is on lower side, the

same can be enhanced without any appeal filed by claimant.

</p><p id="p_12">10.         Respondent no. 1-claimant appears to be satisfied with the

compensation awarded to him and has not filed any appeal seeking

enhancement of compensation, as such, I find no reason to enhance the

compensation in the appeal filed by Insurance Company.

</p><p id="p_13">11.         As a sequel of my above discussion, I find no merit in this

appeal and the same is dismissed.
