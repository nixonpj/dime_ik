</p><p id="p_3">      The appellants are the judgment debtors whose property has been

sold in execution of the decree obtained for realisation of the amount due

to a scheduled Bank. The property was purchased by the Bank itself since

there was no other buyer. Contending that the property has been sold for

an inadequate price, an application was filed to set aside the same. It is

contended that the property is having an extent of 94 cents with a building

thereon. But on the date on which the petition was posted, the petitioners

were absent. Still the court below considered the matter on merits. As a

matter of fact, objection was raised by the judgment debtors and

proclamation was settled only after considering such objection.  But even

now, petitioners are not in a position to say as to the value that the

property would fetch.
</p>
<p id="p_4">      2. We have heard the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the

appellants and the respondents and gone through the records. We find that

the E.P. Amount comes to Rs. 7,44,000/-. Petitioners did not ask for any

private sale. The Execution Petition was filed as early as in 2007 and two

years have elapsed thereafter. Even now, the petitioners are not in a

position to say as to whether they could get a buyer for a higher amount so

as to impress upon this Court that the property has been sold at a lesser

price.   It is up to the petitioners to adduce evidence in support of their

contention that the property will fetch a higher value than what has been

settled as per the proclamation. No such evidence is adduced. In such

circumstances, we find no merit in the contention.             However, an

opportunity is given to the appellants and in case the appellants deposits

the entire amount within a period of six weeks from today, the impugned

order will stand set aside and the appellants will be given an opportunity to

adduce evidence in the I.A. In case of default, this appeal will stand

dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_5">      The appeal is disposed of as above.
