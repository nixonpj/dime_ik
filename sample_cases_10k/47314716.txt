           THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH
                      MP 388 of 2018

      National Health Mission vs. Sitaram Sharma and Anr.
Gwalior, Dated :29/11/2019

       Shri Sankalp Sharma, Counsel for the petitioner.

      None for the respondent no.1.</pre>

<p id="p_1">      Ms. Chitra Bais, Counsel for the respondent no.2.

      This petition under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_1">Article 227</a> of the Constitution of India has

been filed against the Order dated 31-10-2017 passed by <a href="/doc/142278/" id="a_2">Authority

Minimum Wages Act</a> in C.O.C. /120/D/MWA/2017 by which the claim

of the respondent no.1 for overtime has been allowed.

(2)    The necessary facts for the disposal of the present petition in

short are that the petitioner is a body created for providing better health

services and assisting the State Authorities in expanding the reach of

Medical Health Services in each and every part of the State. Several

programmes are being run by the petitioner for the betterment of the

health services.
</p>
<p id="p_2">(3)    The petitioner also works in close relationship with different

private bodies under the "Public Private Partnership" Scheme. Under

this Scheme, 108 Ambulance Services, Janani Suraksha Vehicle and

Deen Dayal Mobile Hospital are being run across the State of Madhya

Pradesh. At present these programmes are being run with an agreement

with respondent no.2. It is the case of the petitioner, that direct payment

is made to respondent no.2 on per kilometer basis. It is claimed by the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                           2</span>
           THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH
                      MP 388 of 2018

petitioner that as per Clause 2.5(b) and 2.5(k) of the Notice Inviting

Tender, all the responsibilities arising out of the employment offered by

respondent no.2 for providing the services, is the responsibility of the

respondent no. 2. As per the agreement, the petitioner has no control or

supervision of the services in any manner.

(4)    The respondent no.1, who claims himself to be an employee of

respondent no. 2 and was working as Ambulance Pilot (Driver) had filed

an application under <a href="/doc/1042342/" id="a_3">Section 20(1)</a> of Minimum Wages Act. It is alleged

by the respondent no.1 that the respondent no.2 has taken 12 hours work

from him and the payment of only 8 hours was done and for the rest of 4

hours, no payment was made. It was also the case of the respondent no.1

that even the payments were made with delay or some past payments are

still pending.
</p>
<p id="p_3">(5)    After the notices, the respondent no2. was proceeded exparte.

However, the petitioner claimed that it has no control or supervision

over the respondent no.2 nor does the petitioner has any relationship

with the respondent no.2.
</p>
<p id="p_4">(6)    The Authority, after recording the evidence of the petitioner and

the respondent no.1, allowed the claim filed by the respondent no.1 by

impugned order.
</p>
<p id="p_5">(7)     Challenging the impugned order passed by the Authority,

<a href="/doc/142278/" id="a_4">Minimum Wages Act</a>, it is submitted by the Counsel for the petitioner,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                          3</span>
          THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH
                     MP 388 of 2018

that there was no employer and employee relationship between the

petitioner and the respondent no.1. The respondent no.1 was employed

by the respondent no.2. The petitioner had no control or supervision

over the respondent no.2. Further, it is submitted that no overtime can

be paid to the drivers of the Ambulance in the light of <a href="/doc/1371707/" id="a_5">Section 13</a> of

Motor Transport Workers Act as held by this Court in the case of

Gursharan Singh Brijbhushan Singh Vs. Manager Rewa Transport

Services reported in AIR 1968 MP 10. It is further submitted that the

provisions of <a href="/doc/1042342/" id="a_6">Section 20(1)</a> of Minimum Wages Act do not apply as

there was no dispute with regard to the rates of Wages, therefore, the

application filed by the respondent no.1 was not maintainable.       To

buttress his contentions, the Counsel for the petitioner has relied upon

the judgments passed by the      Supreme Court in the case of Town

Municipal Council, Athani Vs. The Presiding Officer, Labour

Courts, Hubli and others reported in (196) 1 SCC 873, and the

judgment passed by this Court in the case of Manganese Ore (India)

Ltd., Nagpur Vs. Bisen Rajaram and others reported in 1978 JLJ

411, judgment passed by Karnataka High Court in the case of Chief

Warden, National Institute of Technology Vs. Labour Enforcement

Officer (Central) and others reported in 2012 (135) FLR 897 and

Chhattisgarh High Court in the case of Danteshwari Agencies Vs.

Regional Lab. Commissioner (Central) Authority under Minimum

<a href="/doc/794158/" id="a_7">Wages Act</a>, 1948, Raipur reported in 2018 LabIC 1444.

(8)    Per contra, it is submitted by the Counsel for the respondent no.2,

that the petitioner was the Principal employer and if the petitioner is of

the view that he is not responsible for the acts of the respondent no.2,

then he can recover the awarded amount from it. It is further submitted

that it is incorrect to say that the claim filed by the respondent no.1 was

not maintainable. It is further submitted that the judgment passed in the

case of Gursharan Singh Brijbhushan Singh (Supra) has no

application to the facts and circumstances of the case.

(9)    Heard the learned Counsel for the parties.

(10)   The Supreme Court in the case of Town Municipal Council,

Athani (Supra) has held as under :

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                 5</span>
 THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH
            MP 388 of 2018

20(1) shows that the Authority appointed under that
provision of law is to exercise jurisdiction for
deciding claims which relate to rates of wages, rates
for payment of work done on days of rest and
overtime rates. If there be no dispute as to rates
between the employer and the employees, <a href="/doc/1042342/" id="a_14">Section
20(1)</a> would not be attracted. The purpose of <a href="/doc/1042342/" id="a_15">Section
20(1)</a> seems to be to ensure that the rates prescribed
under the <a href="/doc/142278/" id="a_16">Minimum Wages Act</a> are complied with by
the employer in making payments and, if any
attempt is made to make payments at lower rates, the
workmen are given the right to invoke the aid of the
Authority appointed under <a href="/doc/1042342/" id="a_17">Section 20(1)</a>. In cases
where there is no dispute as to rates of wages, and
the only question is whether a particular payment at
the agreed rate in respect of minimum wages,
overtime or work on off-days is due to a workman or
not, the appropriate remedy is provided in the
<a href="/doc/794158/" id="a_18">Payment of Wages Act</a>. If the payment is withheld
beyond the time permitted by the <a href="/doc/794158/" id="a_19">Payment of Wages
Act</a> even on the ground that the amount claimed by
the workman is not due, or if the amount claimed by
the workman is not paid on the ground that
deductions are to be made by the employer, the
employee can seek his remedy by an application
under <a href="/doc/1803226/" id="a_20">Section 15(1)</a> of the Payment of Wages Act. In
cases where <a href="/doc/1106018/" id="a_21">Section 15</a> of the Payment of Wages Act
may not provide adequate remedy, the remedy can
be sought either under <a href="/doc/142278/" id="a_22">Section 33-C</a> of the Act or by
raising an industrial dispute under the Act and
having it decided under the various provisions of
that Act. In these circumstances, we are unable to
accept the submission made by Mr Sen on behalf of
the appellant that <a href="/doc/1042342/" id="a_23">Section 20(1)</a> of the Minimum
Wages Act should be interpreted as intended to
cover all claims in respect of minimum wages or
overtime payment or payment for days of rest even
though there may be no dispute as to the rates at
which those payments are to be claimed. It is true
that, under <a href="/doc/1764073/" id="a_24">Section 20(3)</a>, power is given to the
Authority dealing with an application under <a href="/doc/1042342/" id="a_25">Section
20(1)</a> to direct payment of the actual amount found
due; but this, it appears to us, is only an incidental
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                           6</span>
           THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH
                      MP 388 of 2018

          power granted to that Authority, so that the
          directions made by the Authority under <a href="/doc/1042342/" id="a_26">Section
          20(1)</a> may be effectively carried out and there may
          not be unnecessary multiplicity of proceedings. The
          power to make orders for payment of actual amount
          due to an employee under <a href="/doc/1764073/" id="a_27">Section 20(3)</a> cannot,
          therefore, be interpreted as indicating that the
          jurisdiction to the Authority under <a href="/doc/1042342/" id="a_28">Section 20(1)</a> has
          been given for the purpose of enforcement of
          payment of amounts and not for the purpose of
          ensuring compliance by the employer with the
          various rates fixed under that Act. This
          interpretation; in our opinion, also harmonises the
          provisions of the <a href="/doc/142278/" id="a_29">Minimum Wages Act</a> with the
          provisions of the payment of <a href="/doc/794158/" id="a_30">Wages Act</a> which was
          already in existence when the <a href="/doc/142278/" id="a_31">Minimum Wages Act</a>
          was passed. In the present appeals, therefore, we
          have to see whether the claims which were made by
          the workmen in the various applications under
          <a href="/doc/142278/" id="a_32">Section 33-C(2)</a> of the Act were of such a nature that
          they could have been brought before the Authority
          under <a href="/doc/1042342/" id="a_33">Section 20(1)</a> of the Minimum Wages Act
          inasmuch as they raised disputes relating to the rates
          for payment of overtime and for work done on
          weekly off-days.
</p>
<p id="p_9">
(11)   Thus, it is clear that if there is no dispute as to rates between the

employer and the employees, <a href="/doc/1042342/" id="a_34">Section 20(1)</a> of Minimum Wages act

would not be attracted because the purpose of <a href="/doc/1042342/" id="a_35">Section 20(1)</a> of

Minimum Wages Act is to ensure that the rates prescribed under the

<a href="/doc/142278/" id="a_36">Minimum Wages Act</a> are complied with by the employer in making

payments and if any attempt is made to make payments at lower rates,

the workmen can approach the Authority under <a href="/doc/1042342/" id="a_37">Section 20(1)</a> of

Minimum Wages Act. In the present case, it is not the case of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                           7</span>
           THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH
                      MP 388 of 2018

petitioner that there was no dispute with regard to rates between the

employer and the employee.       In fact the respondent no.2, who had

employed the respondent no.1 did not appear before the Authority,

<a href="/doc/142278/" id="a_38">Minimum Wages Act</a>, and it was proceeded ex parte.             In fact, the

petitioner had not pleaded before the Authority, that there was no dispute

with regards to the rates of overtime. On the contrary, the only stand

which was taken by the petitioner before the Authority, <a href="/doc/142278/" id="a_39">Minimum Wages

Act</a>, was that it is not responsible and the entire responsibility is of the

respondent no.1. Thus, in fact, the disputed question of fact with regard

to the rates of wages for overtime was never raised by the petitioner

before the Authority, <a href="/doc/142278/" id="a_40">Minimum Wages Act</a>, and therefore, this disputed

question of fact, cannot be raised for the first time, before this Court.

Accordingly, this Court is of the considered opinion that the proposition

of law laid down by the Supreme Court in the case of Town Municipal

Council, Athani (Supra) does not apply to the facts of the case because

of lack of necessary pleadings before the Authority, <a href="/doc/142278/" id="a_41">Minimum Wages

Act</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_10">(12)   It is next contended by the Counsel for the petitioner, that the

respondent no.1 is not entitled for overtime in the light of the judgment

passed by this Court in the case of Gursharan Singh Brijbhushan

Singh (Supra).
</p>
<p id="p_11">(13)    The submission made by the Counsel for the petitioner is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                           8</span>
           THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH
                      MP 388 of 2018

misconceived and is hereby rejected.
</p>
<p id="p_12">(14)   <a href="/doc/76437/" id="a_42">Section 38</a> of Motor Transport Workers Act, 1961 reads as under :

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">          38. Exemptions.-- (1) Nothing contained in this
          Act shall apply to or in relation to any transport
          vehicle--
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">          (i) used for the transport of sick or injured persons;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">          (ii) used for any purpose connected with the security
          of India, or the security of a State, or the
          maintenance of public order.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_6">          (2) Without prejudice to the provisions of sub-
          section (1), the State Government may, by
          notification in the Official Gazette, direct that
          subject to such conditions and restrictions, if any, as
          may be specified in the notification, the provisions
          of this Act or the rules made thereunder shall not
          apply to--
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_7">          (i) any motor transport workers who, in the opinion
          of the State Government, hold positions of
          supervision or management in any motor transport
          undertaking;

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_9">          (iii) any class of employers:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_10">          Provided that before issuing any order under this
          sub-section, the State Government shall send a copy
          thereof to the Central Government.
</blockquote>

<p id="p_13">(15)   The respondent no.1 is the driver of 108 Ambulance which is

used for transport of sick or injured person. Therefore, in view of

exemption clause, it is held that the provisions of <a href="/doc/1276952/" id="a_43">Motor Transport

Workers Act</a>, 1961 have no application to the facts of the case.

(16)   So far as the liability of the petitioner to pay the compensation

amount is concerned, <a href="/doc/130309/" id="a_44">Section 2(e)</a> of Minimum Wages Act, defines the

word "employer" which reads as under :

<p id="p_15">(17)   In the present case, undisputedly, the petitioner entered into an

agreement to operate and maintain the Basic Life Support Ambulances,

Advance Life Support Ambulance, Mobile Medical Units, Janani

                        MP 388 of 2018

Express and Health Helpline. The service provider (respondent no.2)

was entitled for the payment at the rate and in the manner mentioned in

the agreement and different rates were provided for different category of

Ambulances/Services. It is submitted by the Counsel for the petitioner,

that since, a lump sum amount was payable to the service provider

(respondent no.2) at the rate of per km, therefore, the entire liability is of

the respondent no.2.
</p>
<p id="p_16">(18)    Considered the submissions made by the Counsel for the

petitioner. An agreement was entered into with the respondent no. 2 for

operation and maintenance of different categories of Ambulances/

Services.     The respondent no.2 cannot operate and maintain the

Ambulances without employing the drivers. Therefore, employment of

drivers is the integral part of the agreement. Further more, clause 7 of

the agreement reads as under :
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_17">            7.     Monitoring and Evaluation
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_18">            a) The State MPEMAHS Executive Committee and
            State Steering Committee on MPEMAHS shall
            review the performance of the service provider
            monthly/quarterly.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_19">            b) The District Level Monitoring Committee on
            MPEMAHS shall oversee the activity within their
            respective Districts and review the performance of
            service provider in every month.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_20">            c) The services and records of the service provider
            shall be subject to inspection by designated
            officer(s) of the SHSMP.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_21">            d)    SHSMP/Government reserves the right to
            evaluate the performance of the Service Provider as
            well as the Project at any time by an independent

          external agency or through its own internal agency.
          Service Provider shall extend all support to such
          external/internal agency during evaluation(s).
</blockquote>
<p id="p_17">(19)   Thus, it is incorrect to say that the petitioner had no control or

supervision over the activities of the service provider /respondent no.2.

Therefore, it can be safely said that the petitioner had employed the

driver indirectly through the respondent no.2. Thus, the petitioner is a

Principal Employer and he is also jointly liable to pay the amount.

(20)   Further Clause 2.5(k) of Notice Inviting Tender issued by the

petitioner reads as under :
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_22">          2.5       Service Provider's Responsibilities

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_23">          k) Recruit, train and position qualified and suitable
          personnel for implementation of the project i.e.,
          EMAHS at various levels.              The staff so
          engaged/recruited/appointed by the Service Provider
          shall be exclusively on the pay rolls of the bidder
          and shall under no circumstances this staff will ever
          have any claim, whatsoever, for appointment with
          the Government. The service provider shall be
          solely responsible for the performance and conduct
          of the staff notwithstanding the source of hiring such
          staff. The service provider shall be fully responsible
          for adhering to provisions of various laws applicable
          on them including Labour Laws. In case the Service
          Provider fails to comply the provisions of applicable
          laws and thereby any financial or other liability
          arises on the Government by Court orders or
          otherwise, the Service Provider shall be fully
          responsible to compensation/indemnify to the
          Government for such liabilities. For realization of
          such damages, Government may even resort to the
          provisions of any Act, which is in force or other laws
          as applicable on the occurrence of such situations.
</blockquote><span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                                  12</span>
<blockquote id="blockquote_24">                  THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH
                             MP 388 of 2018

       (21) Thus, if the petitioner feels that it has suffered any financial loss

       due to the mistake of the service provider, then it can enforce the

       indemnity clause against the service provider, but cannot escape from

       the liability of making payment of amount to the respondent no.1.

<blockquote id="blockquote_25">       (22)   No other argument is advanced by the Counsel for the petitioner.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_26">       (23)   Accordingly, this Court is of the considered opinion, that the

       Counsel for the petitioner could not point out any perversity in the order
