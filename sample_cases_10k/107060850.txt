<p id="p_1">2   11-01-2017                    Heard learned counsel for the parties.

</p><p id="p_2">                                  Petitioner, by means of this application under

                 <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_1">section 482</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure, have invoked the

                 inherent jurisdiction of this Court with prayer to quash the order

                 dated 24.10.2013, passed by Judicial Magistrate, 1st Class, Banka,

                 Sri Randhir Kumar Prasad, in Complaint Case No. 636 of 2013,

                 wherein and whereby cognizance of the offence under <a href="/doc/1517318/" id="a_2">sections

                 436</a>/<a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_3">34</a> of the Indian Penal Code has been taken and further

                 summons for appearance has been issued against the petitioners.

</p><p id="p_3">                                  The contention of the learned counsel for the

                 petitioner is that no offence against the petitioner is disclosed and

                 the present prosecution has been instituted with mala fide intention

                 for the purposes of harassment. Learned counsel pointed out

                 towards certain documents and statements in support of his
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1"> Patna High Court Cr.Misc. No.51398 of 2013 (2) dt.11-01-2017</span>

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                           2/3</span>




             contention.
</p>
<p id="p_4">                               Having heard learned counsel for the parties and

             keeping in view the facts and circumstances of the case, there

             appears no force in the arguments advanced by learned counsel for

             the petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_5">                               The law regarding sufficiency of material which

             may justify the summoning of accused and also the Court's

             decision to proceed against them in a given case is well settled.

             The Court has to eschew itself from embarking upon a roving

             enquiry into the last details of the case. It is also not advisable to

             adjudge whether the case shall ultimately end in conviction or not.

             Only a prima facie satisfaction of the Court about the existence of

             sufficient ground to proceed in the matter is required.

</p><p id="p_6">                               The submissions made by the learned counsel for the

             petitioner calls for adjudication on pure questions of fact which

             may be adequately adjudicated upon only by the trial Court and

             while doing so even the submission made on point of law can also

             be more appropriately gone into by the trial Court in this case.

             This Court does not deem it proper, and therefore, cannot be

             persuaded to have a pre trial before the actual trial begins.

                                 discretion in the matter and the discretion has to be
                                 judicially exercised by him. Once the magistrate has
                                 exercised his discretion it is not for the High Court,
                                 or even this Court, to substituted its own discretion
                                 for that of the Magistrate or to examine the case on
                                 merits with a view to find out whether or not the
                                 allegations in the complaint, if proved would
                                 ultimately end in conviction of the accused."

<blockquote id="blockquote_2">                                          Perusal of the complaint and also the materials

                        available on record, make out a prima facie case against the

                        accused at this stage. I do not find any justification to quash the

                        order taking cognizance or the summoning order. The prayer for

                        quashing the same is refused as I do not see any abuse of the

                        court's process.
