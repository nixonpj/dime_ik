<pre id="pre_1">         HON'BLE Dr. JUSTICE B.SIVA SANKARA RAO

            CRIMINAL PETITION No.7463 of 2018

ORDER:
</pre>
<p id="p_1">     The petitioner is the sole accused of crime No.550 of

2018 dated 22.06.2018 registered by Madhapur (Guttala)

Police   Station,   Cyberabad,   registered   for   the   offences

punishable under <a href="/doc/1436241/" id="a_1">Sections 420</a> &amp; <a href="/doc/180217/" id="a_2">506</a> IPC, which is outcome

of the private complaint of the 2nd respondent dated

05.06.2018 referred by the learned Magistrate to the police for

investigation under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_3">Section 156(3)</a> Cr.P.C. from which police

having received on 22.06.2018 registered the crime supra,

which is pending for investigation.
</p>
<p id="p_2">      2. The contentions in the quash petition are that the

allegations made in the private complaint supra are false and

frivolous with intend to black mail the petitioner by the 2nd

respondent and there is no prima facie case against the

petitioner/accused and the said crime outcome of private

complaint is abuse of process and liable to be quashed to

secure the ends of justice. The complaint states that accused

made a memorandum of understanding dated 05.01.2016

with Sirisha Constructions to cheat the complainant and one

Deepthi (sister) to a tune of more than Rs.1 crore, said

allegation is false so also the allegation of the petitioner wants

to knock away the property for just Rs.21 lakhs for

committing criminal breach of trust.      The allegation further

that the petitioner/accused realized that he would never
                                    2                                     Dr.SSRB,J
                                                             Crl.P.No.7463 of 2018



succeed in his illegal claims came to the complainant to

threaten with dire consequences by abuse in filthy is also

false   and     frivolous   allegation.   The      allegation        of     the

petitioner/accused shouted on the complainant to see her

end and never allowed to enjoy the property is also not correct

for false and frivolous. It is averred that O.S.No.942 of 2017

filed by the petitioner/accused is pending by the time a

private complaint filed and the same is suppressed. It is also

averred that the complainant and her sister supra owners of

600 square yards in S.No.27 at Guttalabegumpet village,

Serlingampally Mandal, Ranga Reddy District, offered to sell

the same to the petitioner and executed agreement of sale

dated 28.08.2013 for a consideration of Rs.1.20 crores and

petitioner paid Rs.10 lakhs advance to them and handed over

original sale deed dated 19.04.1991, which is source of title in

their name to the petitioner/accused and later even petitioner

made several requests to execute registered document, they

postponed time and again even petitioner is ready with

balance sale consideration of Rs.1.10 crores.            It is for the

repeated requests to execute registered sale deed as supra,

the     complainant         and    her    sister      requested             the

petitioner/accused to enter into a development agreement-

GPA     which     was   dated     06.01.2014       entered      from        the

negotiation and the proposal made by them and when he

approached concerned authorities for approval of the plan for

construction therein, they informed the petitioner that there
                                 3                                Dr.SSRB,J
                                                     Crl.P.No.7463 of 2018



is lot of litigation and unless entire litigation settled the

authorities will not approve any plan. At that time it came to

the notice of the petitioner that there are some civil litigations

pending immediately he approached the defacto complainant

and her husband and father who informed of O.S.No.232 of

2013 pending on the file of District Judge, LB Nagar, for

permanent injunction in relation to the property and it is also

came to light of some other suit O.S.No.210 of 2013 pending

on the file of II Additional District Judge, LB Nagar, for

partition and separate possession of the property. They did

not inform about the aforesaid facts and suppressed to cheat

the petitioner malafide. Subsequently the petitioner came to

know of another suit O.S.No.1541 of 2014 also pending and

where he was impleaded as 1st defendant, however he was not

served with notice, but set exparte. Having come to know of it

he filed application to set aside the exparte order and filed

written statement that were allowed and he is contesting. It

is also averred that the complainant and her sister entered

agreement referred supra and later entered development

agreement-GPA referred supra registered No.457 of 2014 and

subsequently it is on their request the petitioner entered into

agreement of sale dated 23.04.2016 to purchase where it is

referred about the earlier development agreement supra and

all the disputes in relation to the property referred supra and

petitioner paid Rs.7 lakhs further through RTGS to the

account of the complainant thereby paid total Rs.17 lakhs.

                                                   Crl.P.No.7463 of 2018



</pre><p id="p_3">O.S.No.232 of 2013 filed by the complainant and her sister as

plaintiffs, Sirisha constructions was not party to the suit.

One KV Durga Prasad was D.4.              On 14.07.2017 the

defendants in O.S.No.232 of 2013, one KV Durga Prasad and

defacto complainant entered into deed of settlement No.8095

of 2017 in which it is stated first part including Sirisha

construction and transfers and conveys all their rights in the

schedule property to the defacto complainant as 2nd part.

Thereafter they entered into development agreement with

Sirisha construction and obtained approved plan and started

work of construction.    The development agreement entered

with the petitioner by the complainants is a registered

agreement and same not cancelled. When said agreement in

force they have no right to enter into agreement and allowing

of Sirisha construction to make construction in the land

illegally and suppressing the facts they allowed Sirisha

construction to make construction by cheating and playing

fraud. The petitioner thereby filed O.S.No.942 of 2017 which

suit is also pending. It is further averred that the above facts

clearly establish the nature and conduct of the defacto

complainant and the issues are purely civil in nature pending

in civil Courts.   It is also averred that Sirisha construction

with defacto complainant and her husband and father and

IPS officer approached the petitioner/accused saying that

they entered into the development agreement-GPA and

requested to enter into agreement with Sirisha construction
                                  5                                    Dr.SSRB,J

and   KV    Durga    Prasad      by   allowing   them         to     make

constructions and proposed to allot 3200 square feet

comprising of 2 plots to petitioner and they also stated about

already    handed   over   the    land   to   the    builder-Sirisha

construction and they also stated unless same is accepted,

the petitioner has to wait 5 or 6 years and he has also to face

dire consequences and obtained his signatures on some

papers. The petitioner is receiving phone calls from husband

of Deepthi and father of complainant to keep the petitioner in

jail and also receiving phone calls from police at the influence

of IPS officer, their relative. Due to which, the petitioner has

suffered lot of mental agony and tension therefrom. The filing

of the private complaint and registration of the FIR with the

facts in civil nature is nothing but abuse of process and same

is liable to be quashed.
</p>
<p id="p_4">      3. The agreement dated 28.10.2013 first in point of time

entered between Deepthi and her sister Swathi referring as

vendors     with    C.Naganandeeshwar,              who        is        the

petitioner/accused for the 600 square yards site in S.No.27 at

Guttalabegumpet village, which they purchased from Mallesh

and sale deed registered No.3241/1991 dated 19.04.1991 for

Rs.1.20 crores and paid advance of Rs.10 lakhs and balance

payable at the time of registration.             The subsequent

development agreement-GPA registered No.457 of 2014 dated

06.01.2014 between Deepthi and Swathi as first part and
                                6                                   Dr.SSRB,J
                                                       Crl.P.No.7463 of 2018



petitioner/accused    as    2nd        part    as   owners           and

developer/builder respectively for the 600 square yards site

supra referring to the source of title mentioned that the

+ 5 upper floors and residential complex on the schedule land

at the sole and exclusive cost and expenses of him and in the

total built up area and parking areas and undivided shares

land shall be shared between landlord and developer at 30:70

etc., other terms. It also speaks that the construction shall

be completed within 15 months from the date of obtaining

permission from GHMC and grace period is 3 more months.

It is subsequent to the said registered development agreement

without referring to the earlier sale agreement supra between

them     another   agreement      of    sale   dated     23.04.2016

unregistered between Deepthi and Swathi as vendors and

accused as vendee refers to the registered document GPA-

development agreement dated 06.01.2014 and 30% and 70%

respectively to the shares of the owners and developer with

grace period to complete within 15 months the construction

with GHMC permission. Condition No.A3 mentioned apart

from A.1 &amp; A.2 supra of 1st vendor Deepthi at America and 2nd

vendor    at   Mahabubabad        and    the    vendee     (accused)

understood that there is some dispute with the property

under development and it would require some more time to

clear disputes and take up the development activities and

nullify the earlier 2 agreements entered into by the vendors
                                7                                 Dr.SSRB,J
                                                     Crl.P.No.7463 of 2018



and vendee regarding the plot. The condition No.A5 speaks of

mutual discussions, the vendee herein agreed to purchase the

land under development as it is and whereas it is in the

condition for the total consideration of Rs.1 crore and original

sale agreement total Rs.1.20 crores and whereas now it is

confined to Rs.1 crore and it refers to Rs.10 lakhs + Rs.7

lakhs refers to RTGS paid to adjust as advance and remaining

93 lakhs on or before 15.07.2016 with grace period of 15 days

failing which the agreement becomes void.

</p><p id="p_5">     4. Though grace period was till 15.07.2016, the legal

notice given by the accused to Deepthi and Swathi only on

26.06.2017 about one year after expiry of the grace period for

specific performance, saying they (defacto complainant and

her sister) are the owners covered by the registered sale deed

24.04.1991 and applied for urban land clearance and

competent authorities issued Memo stating land falls in

retainable area by rejecting the application.        The defacto

complainant and her sister represented of they have no

experience and qualification in taking up construction of

multistoried building and prevailed upon him to take the

property for development and pursuant to the above, the

development    agreement-GPA       entered   and   registered        on

06.01.2014 for 30% to them and 70% share to him in the

constructed area.     Thereafter he came to know of the

litigation and survey conducted by the AD, surveyor and

given report mentioning entitled only to 180 square yards of
                                 8                               Dr.SSRB,J
                                                    Crl.P.No.7463 of 2018



the land in plot No.1 in S.No.27 and he approached them and

requested to deliver him the land under development. They

requested the petitioner/accused to purchase 600 square

yards for total consideration of Rs.1 crore and entered the

sale agreement on 23.04.2016 supra and they received Rs.7

lakhs through RTGS as advance and Rs.1 crore at the rate of

Rs.16,000/- per square yard. Now the area is 180 square

yards and out of Rs.1 crore, the value is Rs.29 lakhs in

requesting them to permit him to develop said land or to

accept Rs.29 lakhs and execute sale deed in his favour. He

further says in the notice Para 7 onwards ready and willing to

perform his contract and called upon them to deliver

possession or to receive balance sale consideration of Rs.22

lakhs and get the sale deed executed. No doubt in his notice

he was sailing regarding earlier sale agreement of 2013

advance of Rs.10 lakhs referred paid out of Rs.1.20 crore.

They issued their reply dated 10.07.2017 with the averments

some of which contend in the private complaint referred

supra though not in detail.    It is the same now averred as

cheated and deception and criminal intimidation in filing

private complaint and the defacto complainant Swathi for and

on behalf of her sister also in the course of hearing produced

the memorandum of agreement dated 05.01.2016 entered

with Sirisha construction and KV Durga Prasad as first part

with accused as second part for construction therein. One of

the conditions says first part shall be entitled to construct the
                                            9                              Dr.SSRB,J
                                                              Crl.P.No.7463 of 2018



proposed building pursuant to the sanctioned plan referred

dated 15.07.2015 and second part Deepthi and Swathi do not

have any objection, Deepthi and Swathi are not the

signatories to it. He referred in entering on their behalf as

GPA-development holder registered on 06.01.2014 and not

referred the subsequent sale agreement and referred supra of

April 2016.               It is further mentioned by his representing

Deepthi and Swathi of they did not have any claim over 2396

square yards and covered by sanctioned plan and compound

wall and it also referred Sirisha construction responsible to

sell 3200 square feet comprising 2 plots in the proposed

building to build over the property at Rs.5,000/- per square

feet including costs of amenities and pay sale proceeds to the

second part. Leave about the earlier civil litigation pending if

any. Once the allegation is regarding the memorandum of

agreement                entered   with   Sirisha   construction     by      the

petitioner/accused dated 05.01.2016 and the genuineness or

otherwise of the subsequent agreement between the petitioner

and the defacto complainant and her sister of April 2016 is

also in issue from which the earlier GPA-development

agreement registered of 2014 mentioned cancelled. These are

issues when requires investigation, this Court cannot quash

the proceedings merely because earlier disputes are pending.

</p><p id="p_6">           5. In this regard the petitioner in the quash petition

placed reliance on Mohd. Khalid Khan Vs. State of UP1


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">1</span>
    2015 Cri.L.J. 4494
                                         10                            Dr.SSRB,J
                                                          Crl.P.No.7463 of 2018



where it is observed that suit and first appeal are pending on

the subject matter of the present litigation and the issue

regarding ownership of land in question yet to be finalized

therein.         Looking at the aforesaid facts, we are of the view

that at this stage no case has been made against the quash

petitioner for initiating against, thereby set aside the

impugned order.                So far as appellant/accused by quashing

the proceedings against them and also the charge sheet

against them in pursuance of the FIR registered by Wazirganj

Police Station, Lucknow by allowing the appeal.                      There

because the dispute is long pending covered by the civil suit

and appeal required to be finalized, which is the subject

matter not chosen to continue the proceedings. Here the very

sale agreement of 2013 registered development agreement of

2014, subsequent sale agreement of April 2016 between the

defacto complainant and her sister on one side and the

petitioner/accused on other side in issue, leave about his

entering         into     construction/development    agreement        with

Sirisha construction in January 2016, which are the subject

matter of the so called cheating. Once that is required to be

investigated it cannot be quashed merely because earlier civil

suits regarding disputed property if any by saying those are

purely of civil nature.

<p id="p_7">          6. The expression of the Apex Court in Thelapalli

allegation of company hatched the criminal conspiracy and

cheated and misappropriated the complainant, when High
