                  W.P.(C) No. 1990 of 2018
       ---------------------------
           Dated this the 5th day of March, 2018


                        JUDGMENT
</pre>

<p id="p_1">          Petitioner was a dealer under the Kerala Value

Added Tax Act (the Act). The case of the petitioner is that

even before serving a copy of the order imposing penalty

on him under the Act, steps are being taken to invoke the

bank guarantee furnished by the petitioner earlier for

release of the goods in respect of which the penalty is

imposed on him.
</p>
<p id="p_2">          2.   On    25.01.2018,   this   Court   passed   an

interim order directing the respondents concerned to

provide the petitioner a copy of the order imposing

penalty on him.
</p>
<p id="p_3">          3.   Today, when the matter was taken up, the

learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that pursuant
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">W.P.(c) No.1990 of 2018         -2-</span>



to the interim order dated 25.1.2018, he was served with

a copy of the order and immediately thereupon he

preferred Ext.P6 appeal challenging the said order. The

limited prayer made by the learned counsel for the

petitioner, in the circumstances, is for a direction to the

additional sixth respondent to take a decision on Ext.P6

appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_4">           4.   Heard     the   learned   counsel   for   the

petitioner as also the learned Government Pleader.

</p><p id="p_5">           Having regard to the facts and circumstances,

especially the fact that the petitioner has already

furnished the bank guarantee for the amount covered by

the penalty order, I deem it appropriate to dispose of the

writ petition directing the additional sixth respondent to

consider and pass orders on Ext.P6 appeal, within three

months from the date of receipt of a copy of this

judgment. Ordered accordingly. Needless to say that until

orders are passed on the appeal as directed aforesaid, the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">W.P.(c) No.1990 of 2018       -3-</span>



bank guarantee referred to in the writ petition shall not be

invoked.
