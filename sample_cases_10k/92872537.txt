     considered for collateral purpose when the suit is filed for relief

<p id="p_7">     4)               The reasoning given by the Trial Court shows that the

     Court has not touched the provisions of Maharashtra Stamp Act,




                                       
     1958. Both the sides took this Court through the provisions of

     sections 33 to 37 of the said Act. These provisions show that it is
                             
     the duty of the Court to see that the document on which proper
                            
     stamp duty is not paid, is impounded and further procedure is

     followed. It appears that in the present matters, there is some

     misconception. In the agreement which was written on stamp
      


     paper, the consideration amount was shown, but separate
   



     possession receipts were prepared to avoid the payment of

     stamp duty and also registration. In view of these circumstances,





     this Court holds that the Trial Court has committed error in view

     of provision of section 34 of the aforesaid Act. The Trial Court

     ought to have impounded the documents. The Trial Court is to





     follow the procedure laid down for recovery of stamp duty and

     penalty.
