A.M.SHAFFIQUE, J.
</p>
<p id="p_2">

</p><p id="p_3">     Petitioners 1 to 4 and 7 to 10 have approached this Court,

inter alia contending that though they were working as Pre-

Primary School Teachers and Ayahs attached to various schools,

they were not paid the honorarium for the period from August

and September 2012 onwards.
</p>
<p id="p_4">     2.    A statement was filed by the first respondent inter

alia stating that the aforesaid persons were not qualified and

there were no sanctioned posts for payment of honorarium.

</p><p id="p_5">     3.    The learned Single Judge, after considering the

materials placed on record, observed that, petitioners 11 and 12

were qualified and have the eligibility to receive honorarium

and accordingly direction was issued to the Government to pay

their honorarium within a period of four months.

</p><p id="p_6">     4.    As far as petitioners 4, 5, 6 and 13 are concerned, it is

observed that, the institutions, in which, they were working did

not have the approval to conduct Pre-primary section in the

schools. When such a view has already been taken and there is
 WA.No.1650 OF 2019

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                   4</span>


no dispute about the said fact, no claim arise for honorarium as

far as those persons are concerned.
</p>
<p id="p_7">      5.   In respect of petitioners 1, 3, 7, 8 and 9 the learned

Single Judge had observed that they were denied honorarium on

the ground that they did not acquire the qualification. But

according to the learned counsel for the appellant they are all

qualified. Petitioners 1, 3, 7, 8 and 9 were permitted to move

the Government. In such an event, it shall be open for

petitioners 1, 3, 7, 8 and 9 to file proper representation to the

Government       producing   all       materials   relating   to   their

qualification along with the petition and on receipt of the same

the   Government shall consider and pass appropriate orders

within a period of two months from the date of receipt of their

representations.
</p>
<p id="p_8">      With the above observation, this writ appeal is disposed of.
