Ex.P6 is the postmortem certificate. He preserved the viscera for chemical
examination, which revealed that there was no poison detected.  Finally, he
gave opinion that the deceased would appear to have died of shock and
hemorrhage due to multiple stab wounds. 
</p>
<p id="p_37">        2.7. During the course of investigation, on 13.06.2009, at 8.30 a.m.,
P.W.19 arrested the accused near the Petrol Bulk on the Antipatti ? Madurai
Road in the presence of P.Ws.8 and 9.  On such arrest, he made a voluntary
confession, in which, he disclosed the place, where he had hidden the knife.
In pursuance of the same, he took P.W.19 and the witnesses to the said place,
produced a knife (M.O.1).  Then, he forwarded the accused to Court for
judicial remand and handed over the material objects for chemical
examination. According to the analyst report, human blood was found on all
the material objects including M.O.1 ? knife.  But the grouping of the blood
on the knife was inconclusive.  P.W.20 continued the investigation from
17.07.2009 and laid charge sheet against the accused under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_10">Section 302</a> IPC.
</p>
<p id="p_38">        2.8. Based on the above materials, the trial Court framed charges under
<a href="/doc/1318185/" id="a_11">Sections 449</a>, <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_12">302</a> and <a href="/doc/180217/" id="a_13">506(ii)</a> IPC against the accused.  He denied the same.
In order to prove the case, on the side of the prosecution, as many as 20
witnesses were examined, 18 documents and 7 material objects were marked.   
</p>
<p id="p_39">        2.9. Out of the said witnesses, P.Ws.1, 2 and 3 claimed to be the eye
witnesses.  P.W.4 has turned hostile and he has not supported the case of the
prosecution in any manner.  P.W.5 ? a neighbour has stated that he saw the
accused at or about the time of occurrence fleeing from the place of
occurrence.  P.W.6 is the mother of the deceased, who has spoken only on the 
hear say information.  P.W.7 is the wife of the deceased had stated that
while she was at work, she received message from P.W.1 that her husband was  
stabbed.  Therefore, she rushed to the place of occurrence and took the

registration of the case.  P.Ws.19 and 20 has spoken about the investigation

</p>

<p id="p_40">        3. When the above incriminating materials were put to the accused under
<a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_14">Section 313</a> Cr.P.C., he denied the same as false.   On his side, three
witnesses were examined as D.Ws.1 to 3.  D.W.1 is the resident of
Silukkuvarpatti Village.  According to him, there was a longstanding dispute
between P.W.1 and one Subbian and thus, Subbian was an enemy to the family of  
the deceased.  D.W.2 is one Mr.Nagarajan, who is also a resident of
Silukkuvarpatti.  According to him, on the crucial date of occurrence, he
found the deceased lying under a light post at Thirumalkottaipatti with
injuries.  According to him, he gave a phone call for ambulance.  After
arrival of the ambulance, P.W.7 the  wife of the deceased had also come to
the spot.  Thus, according to him, the deceased was taken to the hospital.
D.W.3 is the resident of Kondamanayakkanpatti.  According to him, there was
enmity between one Mr.Subbian and the family of the deceased.  According to
him, the accused and his wife were taken to the custody of the police on
11.06.2009 and after some time, his wife was let off, but the accused was
sent for judicial remand.
</p>
<p id="p_41">        3.1. On his side, he has marked Ex.D.1, which is the intimation sent by
the Casualty Medical Officer of Theni Medical College Hospital to the Sub
Inspector of Police, K.Vilakku Police Station.  This has been marked to prove
that intimation was sent to the police at 12.30 p.m. on 11.06.2009 itself.
In crux, the defence of the accused was a total denial.  Having considered
all the above, the trial Court convicted him as detailed in the first
paragraph of the judgment and accordingly punished him.  That is how, he is
before this Court with this appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_42">        4. We have heard the learned senior counsel for the appellant, the
learned Additional Public Prosecutor for the State and we have also perused
the records carefully.
</p>
<p id="p_43">        5. The learned senior counsel for the appellant would submit that at
the earliest point of time, when the deceased was taken to the hospital, he
told P.W.15 that he was stabbed by an unknown person with knife at his
residence.  This statement, according to the learned senior counsel, being a
dying declaration should be given weightage of.  He would further submit that
P.W.1 could not have been present at the time of occurrence at all.  He would
further submit that P.Ws.2 and 3 being chance witnesses also would not have
been there at the time of occurrence and therefore, their presence also
cannot be believed.  So far as P.W.5 is concerned, this evidence also
deserves rejection, in view of the earliest statement made by the deceased to
the Doctor.  So far as the recovery of knife ? M.O.1, the learned senior
counsel would submit that it is immaterial.  The learned senior counsel would
further submit that there is enormous delay in registering the case and also
despatching the same to the Court, which is not explained by the prosecution,
which also creates doubt in the case of the prosecution.  Thus, according to
the learned senior counsel, the prosecution has failed to prove the case
beyond reasonable doubt and thus, the appellant is entitled for acquittal.
</p>
<p id="p_44">        6. The learned Additional Public Prosecutor would, however, oppose this
appeal.  According to him, the presence of P.W.1 at the house of the deceased
was quite natural and therefore, the same cannot be disbelieved.  He would
further submit that P.Ws.2 and 3 have also witnessed the occurrence and there
are no reasons to reject their evidences.  He would further submit that
simply because P.Ws.2 and 3 are chance witnesses, their evidences cannot be  
rejected, because their evidences duly corroborated by the evidence of P.W.5.
He would further submit that at the time, when the deceased was taken to the
hospital, he was not conscious and therefore, the statement recorded in the
Accident Register that the deceased was stabbed by unknown person was only   
made by his wife ? P.W.7.  Since P.W.7 had not seen the occurrence, quite
naturally, it would not have been possible for her to say the stab injury on
the deceased.  Thus, the statement now recorded in the accident register does
not in any manner disturb the case of the prosecution, the learned Additional
Public Prosecutor submitted.  He would further submit that the medical
evidence duly corroborate the eye witness account of P.W.1.  He would lastly
submit that the recovery of M.O.1 further strengthens the case of the
prosecution.
</p>
<p id="p_45">        7. We have considered the above submissions. 
</p>
<p id="p_46">        8. According to the case of the prosecution, the alleged occurrence was
at 12.30 p.m. on 11.06.2009.  It is alleged that P.Ws.1,2 and 3 had witnessed
the occurrence and P.W.5 saw the accused fleeing away from the scene of 
occurrence.  P.W.7 ? wife of the deceased was not at the house at that time,
as she was in her field.  It was only P.W.1, who sent intimation to her about
the occurrence.  Then P.W.7 returned to her house.   Then, all of them made
arrangement for ambulance to shift the deceased to the hospital.  They went
together to the hospital.     P.W.7 in her chief examination itself stated
that she was told by P.W.1 that the accused stabbed the deceased.  Therefore,
at the time when they had reached the hospital, even P.W.7 was aware of the
fact that it was the accused, who caused the injuries on the deceased.
</p>
<p id="p_47">        9. Now, at 1.30 p.m., the deceased was examined by P.W.15 ? Dr.Dinesh.  
Ex.P11 is the Accident Register.  In the said Accident Register, P.W.15 has
recorded that it was alleged that the deceased was stabbed by a knife by an
unknown person.  According to the learned Additional Public Prosecutor, this
statement would not have been made by the deceased at all.  But during the
cross examination, P.W.15 has categorically stated that the deceased was 
conscious.  In Ex.P11, he recorded that the deceased was conscious.  During
the further cross examination, he has stated that it was only the deceased,
who told him that he was stabbed by an unknown person at his house with 
knife.  Thus, the statement recorded in Ex.P11 was made only by the deceased. 
This statement is a dying declaration falling within the ambit of <a href="/doc/1959734/" id="a_15">Section 32</a>
of the Indian Evidence Act. This dying declaration being the earliest dying
declaration should carry weightage.  It is not as if the accused was not a
known person to the deceased.  When that be so, had it been true that this
accused had stabbed the deceased, the deceased would have told P.W.15 that he  
was attacked by a known person.  But the very fact that he had told the
Doctor that he was stabbed by an unknown person would go to show that there 
is no truth in the case of the prosecution and the prosecution case has been
developed subsequently. 
</p>
<p id="p_48">        10. But the learned Additional Public Prosecutor would submit that this
statement would have been made only by P.W.7 and not by the deceased.   
Assuming that the statement has been made by P.W.7, it is not as if she was
not aware of the fact that the deceased was stabbed by the accused.  Even in
the chief examination, she had told that when she reached the house, P.W.1
told her that the accused had stabbed the deceased.  Thus, she had full
knowledge that it was only the accused, who caused the stab injury on the
deceased.  Had it been true, when she made the statement to P.W.15, she would  
have told that her husband was stabbed by a known person, which has been duly 
contradicted by the statement also.  But she had no explanation for that.
Thus, either way whether it was made by the deceased or it was made by P.W.7, 
it destroys the case of the prosecution.
</p>
<p id="p_49">        11. Added to that the delay in the FIR creates enormous doubt. The
deceased was admitted in the hospital at 1.30 p.m.  Intimation was sent
immediately under Ex.D.1 to the police station.  But no police officer came
to the hospital to record the earliest information regarding the occurrence.
The deceased died at 5.05 p.m.  After receipt of the death intimation only,
P.W.18 rushed to the hospital and recorded the statement of P.W.1.  In the
interregnum period, lot of deliberations would have been gone to make
development in the case.  Whether Ex.P1 would have been preferred at 5.30
itself is doubtful, because the FIR reached the hands of the learned
Magistrate only at 11.30 p.m.  Absolutely there is no explanation for the
same.  After all the hospital, the police station and the residence of the
Magistrate are situated within few kilometres.  After al,l Theni itself, is a
very small town.  Therefore, for a man to carry the FIR from the police
station to the house of the Magistrate, it would not have been taken 5 hours.
That delay also has not been explained away.  This creates doubt in the very
genesis of the FIR.
</p>
<p id="p_50">        12. Then, comes the evidence of P.W.1.  P.W.1 has been disbelieved by 
the trial Court having regard to the conduct of P.W.1.  There was no
bloodstain on his dress materials to substantiate his claim that he was
present at the time of occurrence.  It is not known whether he accompanied
the deceased to the hospital or not.  Going by this conduct and other
inconsistencies in the evidence, the trial Court has disbelieved him.  We
also fall in line with the same.  If P.W.1 is so disbelieved, quite
naturally, P.Ws.2, 3 and 5 are also disbelieved, because, according to them,
they were attracted by the hue and cry raised by P.W.1.  Therefore, the
evidence of P.Ws.1,2, 3 and 5 are also doubtful.  Their evidences are
completely destroyed by the earliest information, i.e. the dying declaration
made by the deceased to the Doctor. 
</p>
<p id="p_51">        13. So far as the motive is concerned, though it is alleged that the
accused developed grudge against the accused, because the deceased had   
developed illicit intimacy with his wife, there is no evidence let in to
prove the same.  Assuming that there was enmity between the accused and the  
deceased, as contended by the learned senior counsel, the motive is a double
edged weapon and it can also be said that because of the said motive, the
appellant has been falsely implicated.  At any rate, in our considered view,
the prosecution has failed to prove the case beyond all reasonable doubts and
therefore, the appellant is entitled for acquittal.
</p>

<p id="p_52">        14. In the result, the criminal appeal is allowed, the conviction and
sentence imposed on the appellant are set aside and he is acquitted of all
the charges.  Fine amount, if any paid by him, shall be refunded to him.
Bail bond shall stand terminated.
