<p id="p_1">              The present appeal has been directed against order dated

14.10.2015 passed by the Additional District Judge, Rupnagar, whereby the

first appellate court has set aside the judgment and decree passed by the trial

court by allowing an application for additional evidence filed by the

defendants with further direction to provide two effective opportunities to

the plaintiffs to rebut the additional evidence to be led by the

defendants/appellants.
</p>
<p id="p_2">             Counsel for the appellants has submitted that the appeal may be

dismissed as withdrawn but the observations made by the first appellate

court in para 18 of the judgment may not be read against the appellants at

the time of final disposal of the suit by the trial court after due compliance
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1"> SAO No. 8 of 2016(O&amp;M)                                     -2-</span>



with the directions issued by the first appellate court.

</p><p id="p_3">             Counsel for respondent No. 1 has got no objection if the trial

court is directed to dispose of the suit without being influenced by any

findings recorded in the impugned judgment dated 14.10.2015.

</p><p id="p_4">             In view of the above coupled with the fact that as the appellate

court has set aside the judgment and decree passed by the trial court for

adjudication afresh in compliance with the direction issued by the said

court, any observations made by the appellate court in regard to merits of

the case would not cause prejudice to rights of the either party and the trial

court would decide the suit afresh without being influenced by any

observations made by the first appellate court.

</p><p id="p_5">             Disposed of accordingly.
