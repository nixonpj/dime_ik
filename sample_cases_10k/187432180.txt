        All these C.M.As. and C.R.P.(MD) No.1039 of 2006 arise out of
compensation awarded due to the accident that took place on 05.10.1998.  The
issue involved in all these matters is one and the same and therefore, all
the cases are disposed of by this common judgment. 
        2. C.M.A.(MD) No.91 of 2011 is filed by the claimant in M.C.O.P.No.1373
of 2000, for enhancement of compensation. 

        3. The respondent/s who has/have filed claim petitions are referred to
as claimant/s, the Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation Ltd., Madurai is
referred to as the first respondent, V.V.R. Transport is referred to as the
second respondent and the United India Insurance Company is referred to as
the third respondent.
        4. The claimants are legal heirs of deceased and injured persons, who
travelled on 05.10.1998 in the buses belonging to the <a href="/doc/167044696/" id="a_2">Tamil Nadu State
Transport Corporation Ltd. and V.V.R. Transport</a>.  The claimants filed
M.C.O.Ps. against the respondents claiming compensation for the death and 
injuries sustained by them due to the accident that took place on 05.10.1998,
involving the buses belonging to the first respondent and the second
respondent, insured with the third respondent.  In 6 M.C.O.Ps., the Tribunal
held both the drivers belonging to the first respondent and the second
respondent were rash and negligent in their driving and held that the first
respondent Corporation is liable to pay 50% and the respondents 2 and 3 are
jointly and severally liable to pay compensation of 50%.  Against the said
award, the third respondent has filed C.M.A.Nos.1785 to 1787 of 2002,
C.M.A.(MD) No.1173 of 2006, 385 of 2007 and C.R.P.(MD)No.1039 of 2006.  In  
M.C.O.P.Nos.909 of 2001 and 1373 of 2000, the Tribunal held that the accident
occurred only due to rash and negligent driving by the driver of the first
respondent and directed the first respondent to pay entire compensation
awarded.  Against that, the first respondent has filed C.M.A.(MD)Nos.1090 of
2006 and 907 of 2013.  The claimant in M.C.O.P.No.1373 of 2000, not being
satisfied with the award amount, filed C.M.A.(MD) No.91 of 2011 for
enhancement of compensation.  
        5. Facts</pre><p id="p_1"> of the case:-
</p><p id="p_2">                (i) On 05.10.1998, at 9.00 a.m., on Vadipatty - Dindigul Main
Road, near Vadipatty Palani Andavar Bus Stop, at Madurai District, the driver
of the bus belonging to the first respondent while overtaking an autorickshaw
going in front of the bus, driver of the bus belonging to the second
respondent came in the opposite direction and dashed each other and that
there was a head-on-collision.  In the accident, few persons died and number
of persons were injured.  The claimants in C.M.A.Nos.1785 to 1787 of 2002 and
C.M.A.(MD) No.385 of 2007 are the legal heirs of the deceased.  The claimants
in C.M.A.(MD)Nos.1173 and 1090 of 2006 and 907 of 2013 and C.R.P.(MD)No.1039    
of 2006 are injured persons.  According to the claimants, the drivers of both
the buses driven the same in a rash and negligent manner and due to that,
accident had occurred.  The claimant in C.M.A.(MD)No.1173 of 2006 stated that
the accident occurred only due to rash and negligent driving by the driver of
the second respondent.  The claimant in C.M.A.(MD) No.907 of 2013 stated that
the accident occurred only due to rash and negligent driving by the driver of
the first respondent.
</p>

<p id="p_3">                (ii) Respondents 1 and 3 filed counter statement denying their
liability on the ground that the driver of other bus was responsible for the
accident and blamed each other.  They also stated that the claimants must
prove the age, income, nature of injury and also submitted that the
compensation claimed is excessive. 
</p><p id="p_4">                (iii) M.C.O.P.Nos.843, 1033 and 1209 of 1999, against which
C.M.A.Nos.1785 to 1787 of 2002 are filed, were heard together, by the learned
Principal District Judge, Madurai and an award was passed on 29.10.2001.  The
Tribunal considering the evidence of eyewitnesses and documents Exs.A1 to A5, 
held that the accident took place due to the rash and negligent driving by
the drivers of both the buses.  The Tribunal rejected the evidence of R.W.1,
the  Conductor of the first respondent corporation bus and R.W.2, the Driver
of the second respondent bus.  The Tribunal also held that the judgment
rendered by the Criminal Court is not binding on the Tribunal and considering
the report of the Motor Vehicle Inspector, Exs.A1, A3 and B1 - certified copy
of rough sketch of place of accident, held that both the drivers are equally
responsible for the accident.  The Tribunal considering the pleadings, oral
and documentary evidence and arguments, awarded compensation, directing the  
first respondent to pay 50% compensation amount and respondents 2 and 3 to  
pay 50% compensation amount jointly and severally. 
</p><p id="p_5">                (iv) M.C.O.P.Nos.334 of 1999, 428 of 2001 and 1223 of 2000,
against which C.M.A.(MD)Nos.1173 of 2006 and 385 of 2007 and C.R.P.(MD)   
No.1039 of 2006 filed, were heard subsequently by a different Tribunal and
considering the common award in M.C.O.P.Nos.843, 1033 and 1209 of 1999, dated   
29.10.2001,  the Tribunal held by separate award that the first respondent is
liable to pay 50% of compensation amount and the respondents 2 and 3 are 
liable to pay 50% of the compensation amount jointly and severally.
</p><p id="p_6">                (v) In M.C.O.P.Nos.909 of 2001 and 1373 of 2001, the Tribunal
held that only the driver of the first respondent was responsible for the
accident and directed the first respondent to pay entire compensation.
Against the said award, C.M.A.(MD) Nos.1090 of 2006 and 907 of 2013 are filed
by the first respondent.
</p>
<p id="p_7">        6. The learned counsel appearing for the third respondent Insurance
Company contended that the Tribunal failed to consider the evidence let in by
the parties in proper perspective and erred in holding that the driver of the
bus belonging to the second respondent is also responsible for the accident.
The Tribunal erroneously rejected the evidence of R.W.2, the driver of the
bus belonging to the second respondent.  The Tribunal ought to have held that
the driver of the first respondent alone was responsible based on the
evidence of R.W.2 and Ex.A1 FIR and Ex.B1 Rough Sketch.  The Tribunal ought  
to have seen that criminal proceedings were initiated only against the driver
of the bus belonging to the first respondent and as per the Rough Sketch, the
accident took place on extreme right side of the road.  The Tribunal did not
properly appreciate the evidence of witnesses that the accident occurred when
the driver of the bus belonging to the first respondent was trying to
overtake an autorickshaw and dashed against the bus belonging to the second
respondent, which was coming in opposite direction.  The learned counsel for
the third respondent also submitted that the claimant in one M.C.O.P. has
categorically stated that the accident took place due to rash and negligent
driving by the driver of the bus belonging to the first respondent.
</p>        
<p id="p_8">        7. The first respondent was represented by Mr.D.Sivaraman in
C.M.A.No.1785 of 2002 and Mr.M.Prakash in C.M.A.(MD) No.907 of 2013.  Both   
the learned counsel contended separately that the evidence clearly shows that
the driver of the bus belonging to the second respondent was driving the bus
in a rash and negligent manner and in spite of signal given by the driver of
the bus belonging to the first respondent, the driver of the bus belonging to
the second respondent proceeded further and dashed against the bus belonging 
to the first respondent.  The Tribunal rightly rejected the evidence of
R.W.2, driver of the second respondent and FIR and judgments in Criminal
Proceedings and rightly relied on the report of Motor Vehicle Inspector and
rough sketch, and consequently, held that both drivers are equally
responsible for the accident.  The Tribunal in M.C.O.P.No.909 of 2001 and
M.C.O.P.No.1373 of 2000, did not properly appreciate the evidence and
judgment delivered in other 6 M.C.O.Ps., fixing the liability on both the
drivers.  The learned counsel for the first respondent contended that except
the claimant in one M.C.O.P., all other claimants and witnesses have stated
that both the drivers were driving the buses in a rash and negligent manner.
</p>
<p id="p_9">        8. The learned counsel for the first respondent also submitted that
while overtaking autorickshaw, driver of the bus belonging to the first
respondent gave necessary signal to the bus coming in opposite direction,
therefore, the Tribunal ought to have held that the driver of the bus
belonging to the second respondent is alone responsible for the accident.
</p>
<p id="p_10">       9. The learned counsel appearing for the appellant in C.M.A.(MD)No.91
of 2011 contended that the appellant/claimant was working as noon meal
organizer and also as a Tailor, she was earning           Rs.1,200/- p.m..
Due to the accident, appellant/claimant in C.M.A.(MD)No.91 of 2011 suffered
dislocation of hip and shortening of leg by 5 cm.  She underwent three
surgeries and a rod was inserted. The appellant was taking treatment as
inpatient in Government Rajaji Hospital, Madurai, from 05.10.1998 to
04.02.1999 and in Government Hospital, Vadipatty, as inpatient from
04.02.1999 to 11.03.1999.  The appellant suffered 62% permanent partial
disability. The Tribunal failed to grant proper compensation for permanent
partial disability and also on other heads as claimed by the appellant.  In
view of 62% disability suffered by the appellant, the Tribunal ought to have
applied multiplier and granted compensation for loss of income.
</p>
<p id="p_11">        10. The learned counsel for the respondents in C.M.A.(MD)No.91 of 2011
contended that the Tribunal had properly appreciated the evidence and awarded
just compensation and prayed for dismissal of C.M.A.(MD) No.91 of 2011.
</p>
<p id="p_12">        11. I have heard the learned counsel appearing for the parties and
perused the materials available on record.
</p>
<p id="p_13">        12. Points for consideration in all these appeals are,
</p><p id="p_14">                (i) Whether the drivers of both the buses are equally responsible
for the accident or whether the driver of the bus belonging to the first
respondent alone is responsible?; and
</p><p id="p_15">                (ii) Whether the appellant in C.M.A.(MD) No.91 of 2011 is
entitled for enhancement of compensation?
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">        13. Point No.(i):
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">                (i) From the materials available on record, it is seen that in
all the claim petitions, eyewitnesses were examined.  All the eyewitnesses
except the claimant in M.C.O.P.No.1373 of 2000, stated that both the drivers
were driving the bus in a rash and negligent manner.  They have also stated
that the accident occurred when the driver of the bus belonging to the first
respondent was trying to overtake an autorickshaw going in front of the bus.
</blockquote><p id="p_16">Evidence was also let in that the driver of the bus belonging to the first
respondent gave signal to the bus coming in the opposite direction that he is
overtaking the autorickshaw.  The driver of the bus belonging to the second
respondent deposed that on seeing the bus belonging to the first respondent,
coming in a rash and negligent manner, he stopped the bus and in spite of the
same, the driver of the bus belonging to the first respondent dashed against
the bus belonging to the second respondent.  The Tribunal considered these
rival contentions of R.W.1, the conductor of the bus belonging to the first
respondent as well as R.W.2, the driver of the bus belonging to the second
respondent and the report of the Motor Vehicle Inspector and rough sketch of
the place, where the accident took place, and came to the conclusion that the
accident took place only due to rash and negligent driving by both the
drivers.  The Tribunal rightly rejected the evidence of R.W.1 and R.W.2, as
they are interested witnesses.  The Tribunal rejected the F.I.R. and the
Judgment of the Criminal Court after properly appreciating the evidence, both
oral and documentary, let in before it.  The Tribunal has given valid reason
for not accepting the F.I.R. and Judgments of Criminal Court.  It is well
settled that when two vehicles are involved in the accident, based on
evidence, liability must be fastened on the owners of both the vehicles.  In
the present case, evidence available on record clearly shows that the drivers
of both the vehicles are equally responsible for the accident.  Therefore,
the finding of the Tribunal that the first respondent is liable to pay 50%
and the respondents 2 and 3 are to pay 50% is based on valid and cogent
reasons and there is no infirmity in the said finding.  Therefore, the said
finding is confirmed.
</p><p id="p_17">                (ii) As far as the award in M.C.O.P.Nos.909 of 2001 and 1373 of
2000 are concerned, the Tribunal has not properly appreciated the evidence.
The Tribunal has erred in accepting the evidence of the claimant in
M.C.O.P.No.1373 of 2000 to hold that only the driver of the first respondent
alone was responsible for the accident.  Similarly, the Tribunal failed to
see the evidence of the claimant in M.C.O.P.No.909 of 2001, where the
claimant had deposed that the driver of the first respondent gave signal, but
the driver of the second respondent failed to react on the said signal.
Therefore, the reasons given by the Tribunal fixing the liability only on the
driver of the first respondent corporation bus are not valid and hence, the
finding of the Tribunal in these two M.C.O.Ps are liable to be set aside and
accordingly, set aside.
</p>
<p id="p_18">        14. Point No.(ii):
</p><p id="p_19">                (i) The appellant in C.M.A.(MD) No.91 of 2011 has proved that he
was inpatient from 05.10.1998 to 11.03.1999 in two different Government
Hospitals and that he suffered 60% partial permanent disability due to
dislocation of hip, surgeries, inserting plate and shortening of his leg by 5
c.m.  The appellant claimed that he was earning a sum of Rs.1,200/- p.m. as
noon meal organizer as well as Tailor.  She produced Ex.P5 salary
certificate, with regard to his employment as noon meal organizer and was
earning Rs.900/- p.m.  The appellant has not proved that due to the accident
and injury, she lost her job as noon meal organizer.  The respondents have
not let in any contra evidence to prove that the appellant did not work as
noon meal organizer.  In the circumstances, the contention of the learned
counsel for the appellant that the appellant is entitled to compensation for
loss of earning capacity as well as for partial permanent disability, as she
suffered 62% disability, has considerable force.  Similarly, the contention
of the learned counsel for the appellant that the compensation amount awarded
under different heads is meagre is also acceptable. Therefore, award of the
Tribunal is modified as follows:
</p><p id="p_20">The appellant was 45 years at the time of accident.  Therefore, proper
multiplier applicable to her age as per the second schedule to <a href="/doc/22871263/" id="a_3">Section 163-A</a>
of the Motor Vehicles Act, is 14.  Hence, the appellant is entitled to loss
of earning capacity as follows:
</p><p id="p_21">                900 x 12 x 14 x 62 / 100 = Rs.93,744/-
</p><p id="p_22">                (ii) The appellant was in hospital for 5+  months.  The Tribunal
did not grant any amount towards attendant charges.  Considering the facts
and circumstances, a sum of Rs.12,000/- is granted towards attendant charges.
The Tribunal awarded a sum of Rs.10,000/- towards pain and suffering. Taking
into consideration the fact that the appellant was in hospital for 5+  months
and underwent surgeries, the same is enhanced to Rs.20,000/-.  In all other
aspects, the award of the Tribunal is confirmed.
