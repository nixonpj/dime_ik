       IN THE HIGH COURT OF PUNJAB AND HARYANA AT
                       CHANDIGARH


                        Civil Revision No. 243 of 2009
                        Date of decision: 21.01.2009


Bhupinder Singh                                         ...Petiitioner
                                  Versus

Harvinder Singh and others                            ...Respondents


CORAM: HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE S.D.ANAND.


Present:    Mr. Chanchal K.Singla, Advocate, for the petitioner.

                                            *****

S.D.ANAND, J.
</pre>
<p id="p_1">            Plaintiff-Harvinder Singh filed a suit for a declaration that the

selection of respondent no.2 as a Salesman was illegal inasmuch as the

selection process by which respondent no.2 (Bhupinder Singh) had been

appointed was void and unlawful/unfair and against the principle of natural

justice.
</p>
<p id="p_2">            The respondent no.1-Harvinder Singh also sought the restraint

of respondents No.1 and 3 from allowing respondent no.2 to join as a

Salesman and also applied for a mandatory injunction for a direction to

respondents no.1 and 3 to appoint the petitioner (Harvinder Singh) as a

Salesman and to allow him to join that post.
</p>
<p id="p_3">            That suit was decreed in his favour by the learned Trial Court,

vide judgment and decree dated 23.5.2008.
</p>
<p id="p_4">            Defendant -petitioner Bhupinder Singh filed an appeal against

impugned judgment and decree before the learned District Judge, Patiala.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1"> Civil Revision No. 243 of 2009                                   -2-</span>

</p><p id="p_5">                                       ****


In that appeal, he also filed an application for the stay of operation of the

impugned judgment and decree whereby his services had been

terminated.
</p>
<p id="p_6">              The plea was declined by the learned Ist Appellate court by

observing that service of the appellant having already been terminated on

23.5.2008 and successful plaintiff having already joined that post on

18.7.2008, the requested interim relief could not be granted.

</p><p id="p_7">              Since the impugned decree stands effectuated, the clock

cannot be put back. A restraint plea would be competent only if the act to

be restrained has not yet been effected. In the present case, the decree

has been given effect to inasmuch as the services of defendant/petitioner

were terminated on 23.5.2008 and respondent-plaintiff has already joined

on 18.7.2008. These facts are noticed in the impugned order itself.

</p><p id="p_8">              The petition is held to be completely devoid of merit and

ordered to be dismissed in limine. However, in response to a verbal plea, it

is directed that the learned Ist Appellate court shall dispose of the appeal

itself within six months from the next date of hearing. This order is granted

in view of the fact that fate of the appeal would, in all probability, turn upon

the legal interpretation of the Rules under reference.
