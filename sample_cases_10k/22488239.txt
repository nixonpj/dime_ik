     Mandya District - 571 434.      ...RESPONDENTS

(By Smt.Harini Shivananda, Advocate for R-2
     Notice to R-1 dispensed with)

      This MFA is filed under <a href="/doc/93665491/" id="a_1">Section 173(1)</a> of MV Act
against the Judgment and Award dated 30.03.2016
passed in MVC No.729/14 on the file of the Additional
Senior Civil Judge and JMFC, Pandavapura, partly
allowing the claim petition for compensation and
seeking enhancement of compensation.

     This appeal coming on for Orders, this day, the
Court delivered the following:-


                       JUDGMENT
</pre>

<p id="p_1">     The present appeal has been preferred by the

appellant-claimant   challenging   the   Judgment    and

Award passed by Additional Senior Civil Judge and

JMFC,   Pandavapura    in   MVC    No.729/2014      dated

30.03.2016.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">     2. The accident in question is not in dispute. So

also, the involvement of the offending vehicle insured

with the respondent.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                    3</span><p id="p_4">


</p><p id="p_5">        3. It is contended by the learned counsel for the

appellant that though the doctor has assessed the

disability to the extent of 20% of the particular limb,

Tribunal, by taking the national income at Rs.6,000/-

p.m.,     and   disability    at       7%,    has    awarded   the

compensation      on    the    lower         side.    He   further

contended that the compensation awarded under the

head loss of amenities, loss of income during laid up

period are also on the lower side. On these grounds,

he prays for allowing the appeal by enhancing the

compensation.
</p>
<p id="p_6">
</p><p id="p_7">        4. Per contra, learned counsel for respondent-

insurer vehemently argued by justifying the Judgment

and Award passed by the Tribunal.
</p>
<p id="p_8">
</p><p id="p_9">        5. As could be seen from the Judgment and

Award passed by the Tribunal and Wound Certificate

at Ex.P.6, the petitioner has suffered lacerated wound

over left eye-brow, lacerated wound over right eye-
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                              4</span>


brow and CT scan of the head was done and found

right zigomatic arch, lateral wall of right orbit,

anterior, medial, lateral walls and roof of right

maxillary.   Sinus was found and the doctor who has

treated him has opined that the injuries are grievous

in nature.    Records also indicate that the petitioner

has   sustained   fracture   of   right     zygomatic   arch,

fracture of lateral wall of right orbit, fracture of

anterior, medial, lateral walls and roof of right

maxillary sinus with hemosinus and soft tissue injuries

in    bilateral   peri-orbita     region.      Taking    into

consideration the said aspect, P.W.2-Dr.B.S.Madhu

who was examined before the Tribunal, has assessed

the disability to the particular limb at 20%.            The

Tribunal, by taking 7% disability to the whole body,

has assessed the compensation as follows:

</p>                                               Rs.<pre id="pre_2">

1. Pain, shock and agony                    20,000-00

2. Medical expenses, foot, diet
Nourishment, attendant,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                            5</span>


Conveyance and other
Incidental expenses                     20,000-00

3. Loss of income during
Treatment period                          6,000-00

4. Disappointment and
Discomfort and loss of
Amenities                               85,680-00

5. Disappointment, discomfort
Frustration and loss of amenities        10,000-00
                                     ----------------
                Total                  1,41,680-00
                                    ----------------

</pre><p id="p_10">     6. Though under the normal circumstances, the

compensation awarded by the Tribunal appears to be

justifiable, but the Tribunal has committed an error at

the time of taking the notional income at the rate of

Rs.6,000/- p.m.    Admittedly, the accident is of the

year 2014. Even in Lok Adalath, while assessing the

compensation, notional income at Rs.8,500/- p.m., is

the yard stick adopted. If the income is taken as

Rs.8,500/- p.m., taking 7% disability, the appellant-

claimant is entitled to an amount of Rs.1,21,380/-

(Rs.8,500/- x 12 x 17 x 7/100) under the head loss of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                  6</span>


future income and discomfort. Keeping in view the

injuries and the fracture, the compensation awarded

under the other heads also appears to be on the lower

side. Therefore, I deem it proper to award an amount

of Rs.40,000/- under the head pain and suffering,

Rs.25,500/- is awarded under the head loss of income

during laid up period and Rs.30,000/- is awarded

under the head loss of amenities and discomfort. The

compensation     awarded        under      the   head     medical

expenses, food and other incidental expenses, is

undisturbed.
</p>
<p id="p_11">
</p><p id="p_12">     7. Keeping in view the above said facts and

circumstances, the appellant-claimant is entitled to a

total compensation of Rs.2,36,880/-.                   Since the

Tribunal   has   already        awarded      an       amount    of

Rs.1,41,680/-,    after        deducting     the      same,    the

appellant-claimant        is     entitled        to     additional

compensation of Rs.95,200/- with 6% interest p.a.,

from the date of petition till realization. Accordingly,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                 7</span>


the appeal is allowed in part.           The Judgment and

Award passed by Additional Senior Civil Judge and

JMFC,      Pandavapura     in   MVC      No.729/2014   dated

30.03.2016 is modified as indicated above.


</p><p id="p_13">         The respondent-insurer is directed to deposit the

compensation awarded by the Tribunal and additional

compensation awarded by this Court within a period of

six weeks from today.           While depositing the said

amount, insurer is directed to deduct the interest for

the delayed period of 224 days.
</p>
<p id="p_14">
</p><p id="p_15">         Registry   is   directed   to    draw   the   award

accordingly.
