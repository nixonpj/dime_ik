25.3.11                       W.P. 11479 (W) of 2009
sk


          Mr. Gautam Kumar Maity
                         ... For Petitioner

          Mrs. Arati Sircar
                              ... For State



                       The writ petitioner has impugned the action
          of the respondent authorities for deducting a sum of Rs.</pre>
<p id="p_1">          55,607/- on account of overdrawn at the time of
          preparation of the Pensionary Payment Order, being
          Annexure P-2 to the writ petition.
</p><p id="p_2">                       The    writ   petitioner   attained   the   age    of
          superannuation on and from 30.3.1991 By exercising
          option under ROPA 1990, the writ petitioner was allowed
          to work on extension.       The writ petitioner availed five
          extensions and was paid salary for the service he
          rendered during the extended period.
</p><p id="p_3">                       Even on expiration of the fifth extension, the
          writ petitioner was not paid the retiral benefits.           After
          persuasion    Pensionary     Payment      Order    was   issued
          deducting and/or adjusting a sum of Rs. 55,607/- as
          overdrawn.
</p><p id="p_4">                       According     to   the     writ   petitioner,     the
          authorities have wrongfully and illegally adjusted and/or
          deducted the said sum from the terminal benefits without
          giving any opportunity of hearing. It is further contended
          that the authorities cannot deduct the amount which has
          been legally paid to the writ petitioner treating the same
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                               2</span>


as overdrawn from the retiral benefit.
</p><p id="p_5">             The     District     Inspector   of   Schools,
respondent no. 3, contends that the writ petitioner was
not entitled to avail any extension after attaining the age
of superannuation and the salary, which was paid by the
authority, was under mistaken belief that the writ
petitioner was entitled to such extension.
</p><p id="p_6">             It is further contended that the mistake is
capable of being rectified and the excess salary which has
been paid to the writ petitioner, during the extended
period, is liable to be adjusted and/or deducted from the
retiral benefit.
</p><p id="p_7">             Having considered the respective submissions
of the parties, it appears that the writ petitioner was
allowed to work on extension and in fact enjoyed upto
fifth extension. For the work, which he rendered during
the extended period, the writ petitioner was paid salary
for the same. The authorities are now trying to contend
that the petitioner was not entitled to such extension and
the excess amount which has been paid is liable to be
refunded by the writ petitioner.
</p><p id="p_8">             It is equally true that the petitioner has
worked during the extended period and it is his legal right
to get the salary for which he has rendered his service.
The authorities cannot turn around and contend that
such payment has been made in contravention to the
relevant circulars and Rules, after having availed of the
services of the petitioner.
</p><p id="p_9">             The point whether the Court can grant relief
against the recovery of excess money adjusted and/or
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                            3</span>


deducted as overdrawn by the authority at the time of
issuance of Pensionary Payment Order, is answered in the
case of <a href="/doc/1993685/" id="a_1">Shyam Babu Verma &amp; Ors. -vs- Union of India &amp;
Ors</a>., reported in (1994) 2 SCC 521, wherein the Hon'ble
Apex Court has passed an order against recovery or
adjustment of any excess amount paid to the employee for
no fault on his part. Relying upon the said judgment of
the Apex Court, a Single Bench of this Court, in the case
of <a href="/doc/134048489/" id="a_2">Kamala Kant Jha -vs- State of West Bengal &amp; Ors</a>., in
paragraph 14 has observed the following:
</p><p id="p_10">            "I,     however,   find   substance   in   the
submissions of the learned Advocate for the petitioner and
I hold the petitioner is entitled to get the benefit of pay
fixation as contained in Annexure 'P-2' to this petition.
By following the decision of the Hon'ble Apex Court in the
case of Shyam Babu Verma (supra), I further hold that
even if any excess payment was found to have been made
to the petitioner while he was in service, such excess
payment cannot be realised and/or adjusted from the
retiral benefits of the petitioner after his retiremement,
particularly when it is found that the petitioner had no
hand either in the process of such refixation or pay or in
the process of such alleged overpayment."
</p><p id="p_11">            Another Single Bench of this Court, in the
case of <a href="/doc/174680830/" id="a_3">Dhirendra Nath Purkait -vs- State of West Bengal
&amp; Ors</a>., reported in 2008 (3) CHN 771, has also taken a
similar view.     The Division Bench of this Court, in the
case of <a href="/doc/75776993/" id="a_4">Manohar Mishra -vs- State of West Bengal &amp; Ors</a>.,
reported in 2009 (2) CLJ (Cal) 468, uniformly laid down
that the excess amount, if paid to the employee for no
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                   4</span>


fraud    on    his    part,     cannot     be     recovered    after   his
retirement.
</p><p id="p_12">               Thus on the basis of the discussion above,
the purported act of the respondent authorities, in
deducting the said sum of Rs. 55,607/- as overdrawn is
not sustainable and is hereby quashed and set aside.
</p><p id="p_13">               It    further     appears         that   the   respondent
authorities have unreasonably withheld the pensionary
benefits of the writ petitioner. The petitioner attained the
age of superannuation on and from 30.3.1991 and the
authorities have issued the Pensionary Payment Order on
19th February 2009. The gratuity amount has not been
paid    to    the    writ     petitioner    which       the   respondent
authorities     are     liable        to   pay     on    attainment     of
superannuation.
</p><p id="p_14">               In such view of the matter, the petitioner is
further entitled to an interest at the rate of 10% to be
calculated from the from the date of attainment of
suppernuation, i.e. 30.3.1991, till the actual payment,
so far as the amount on account of gratuity is
concerned.
</p><p id="p_15">               The Director of Pension, Provident Fund
and Group Insurance, respondent no. 4, is directed to
recast the Pensionary Payment Order in the light of the
observations made hereinabove within six weeks from the
date of communication of this order and while preparing
the Pensionary Pension Order, shall also include an
interest at the rate as awarded hereinabove.
</p><p id="p_16">               The     writ    application,        accordingly, stands
disposed of.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                             5</span>


<p id="p_17">             There will be no order as to costs.
</p><p id="p_18">             Urgent photostat certified copy be supplied to
the parties, if applied for, on priority basis.
</p>
