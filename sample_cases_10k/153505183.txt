to the notice of motion no.4227 of 2007.

amendment is only to introduce paragraph to state that the suit is barred by

limitation, which right plaintiff would have had even without pleadings, he

has no objection.

accordingly disposed in terms of prayer clauses - (a) and (b).

1                Not on board. By consent, taken up for hearing.


2                Mr. Rebello, counsel for plaintiff has no objection to the relief

prayed for in this notice of motion by defendants.


3                Therefore,   notice   of   motion   is   allowed   and   accordingly

disposed in terms of prayer clause - (a).

1                This chamber summons is taken  out by plaintiff  for  leave to

amend the plaint as per the Schedule annexed to the chamber summons.


2                Defendants have filed an affidavit in reply through Dr. Praveen

C. Pahurkar affirmed on 6th October 2017.</p><pre id="pre_3">

3                At the outset, I have to observe that the reply is filed without

</pre><p id="p_9">proper application of mind. This chamber summons is for leave to amend

the plaint and the question of seeking any interim or ad-interim relief does

not arise nor it is prayed for in this chamber summons. Paragraph 1 of the

affidavit in reply, however, states "I say that I am filing the present affidavit

in   reply   for   the   limited   purpose   of   opposing   a   grant   of   any   interim   or

ad-interim   reliefs   in   the   chamber   summons   and   I   crave   leave   to   file   an

additional   affidavit   as   and   when   necessary   .........".   Therefore,   I   have   no

hesitation to observe that Dr.   Praveen C. Pahurkar, who has affirmed the

affidavit in reply, has not even understood what he is filing the reply for.


4                I must now add that I am dealing with this chamber summons

without   any   assistance   from   anybody   appearing   for  Brihanmumbai

Municipal   Corporation  or   others.   Mr.   Pimple   states   that   he   has   no

instructions in this matter. There is nobody else appearing for defendants. If

one reads the  affidavit in  reply, the  defence  taken  by  defendants  is  that

there is a delay which has not been explained and there is no explanation as

to why the amendment application was not taken out earlier and plaintiff

wants to delay this proceeding.

<p id="p_10">
5                From the Schedule, it is obvious that plaintiff wish to introduce

certain   developments   which   have   transpired   after   the   suit   was   filed,

particularly,   the   order   passed   on   31st  October   2011   by   the   Charity

                             Commissioner. This chamber summons has been lodged on 4 th  May 2012.

                             I do not see any undue delay in the matter. Issues are also yet to be framed.


                             6                Therefore,   chamber   summons   is   allowed   and   accordingly
