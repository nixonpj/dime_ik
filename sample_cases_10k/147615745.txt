Present:-    Mr. Shvetanshu Goel, Advocate,
             for the petitioner.

             Ms. Simranjeet Kaur, AAG, Punjab.

             None for respondent No.2-complainant.

<p id="p_1">             Petitioner - Ramanjit Singh Walia has brought the instant petition

under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_1">Section 482</a> Cr.P.C. for quashing of FIR No. 0081 dated 15.06.2017, for

offences under <a href="/doc/1293807/" id="a_2">Sections 461</a>, <a href="/doc/1904534/" id="a_3">462</a>, <a href="/doc/222396/" id="a_4">427</a>, <a href="/doc/180217/" id="a_5">506</a> and <a href="/doc/1897847/" id="a_6">120-B</a> of IPC, registered at Police

Station City Division No.8, Ludhiana, against him, alongwith consequential

proceedings arising therefrom, on the basis of compromise, stated to have been

effected between him and complainant Amit Yadav - arrayed as respondent No.2.

</p><p id="p_2">             When the petition came up for hearing on 19.03.2018, notice of

motion was ordered to be issued. Mr. Yashasve Kapila, Advocate, had put in

appearance on behalf of complainant-respondent No.2.            Then in light of the

contention that parties have since effected compromise, they were directed to put

in appearance before the trial Court to get their statements recorded with regard to

compromise and the trial Court was directed to send a report to this Court.

             Report has been received from Judicial Magistrate 1st Class,

Ludhiana, through District and Sessions Judge, Ludhiana, in terms of which

complainant-Amit Yadav and accused-petitioner Ramanjit Singh Walia had

appeared there and their statements were recorded, in terms of which they have

admitted to have entered into a voluntary compromise, with free will, without any

pressure, threat or undue influence. Further complainant has stated that he has no

objection if the FIR in question is quashed by this Court. There is nothing on

record to doubt the genuineness of the compromise so arrived at between the

parties.   It has been reported that no accused has been declared proclaimed

offender in the FIR in question.                 Alongwith the report statement of the

complainant and the accused, in original, have been annexed.

</p><p id="p_4">             I have heard learned counsel for the petitioner and learned State

counsel, besides going through the record.
</p>
<p id="p_5">             The dispute between the parties has been resolved amicably, which

appears to have been arrived at between them voluntarily without any threat or

coercion and in terms of ratio of the authority reported as <a href="/doc/50709322/" id="a_7">Kulwinder Singh and

others vs. State of Punjab and others</a> 2007 (3) RCR (Criminal) 1052, where in

para 28, it has been held as under :-

<p id="p_6">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">                "The compromise, in a modern society, is the sine qua

                non of harmony and orderly behaviour. It is the soul of

                justice and if the power under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_8">Section 482</a> of the Cr.P.C.

                is used to enhance such a compromise which, in turn,

                enhances the social amity and reduces friction, then it

                truly is "finest hour of justice"."

             It has been observed that High Court has power to quash prosecution

in order to achieve ends of justice and to prevent abuse of process of law. Though

such powers are unlimited but those are to be exercised sparingly and with utmost

care and caution. Though there is no statutory bar which can effect the inherent

power of High Court under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_9">Section 482</a> Cr.P.C.</blockquote><p id="p_7">

</p><p id="p_8">             The compromise is in interest of peace and tranquility in the society

and for such like reasons this Court can quash the FIR and ancillary proceedings

exercising power under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_10">Section 482</a> Cr.P.C., it appears to be a fit case to exercise

such powers.
</p>
<p id="p_9">             Accordingly, the petition is allowed and the abovesaid FIR alongwith

ancillary proceedings are hereby quashed.</p><pre id="pre_2">
