HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH : AT JABALPUR

              Criminal Appeal No. 1605/2007

        Jawaharlal Yadav @ Chunkaman and another
                           Vs.
                       State of M.P.

                   As Per : G.S.Solanki, J.

           Shri Satish Chaturvedi, Advocate for the appellants.
           Shri R.N. Yadav, PL for the State.
                       JUDGMENT
</pre><p id="p_1">                        [18.7.2013]
</p><p id="p_2">1)         This appeal has been filed by the appellants under
     <a href="/doc/929532/" id="a_1">Section 374(2)</a> of the Cr.P.C. being aggrieved by
     conviction and sentence recorded by the learned Second
     Additional Sessions Judge, Sehore vide order dated
     18.7.2007 passed in Special Case No. 43/2006 whereby
     the appellants have been convicted for the offences
     punishable under <a href="/doc/594493/" id="a_2">Sections 294</a>, <a href="/doc/1208971/" id="a_3">353</a>, <a href="/doc/68146/" id="a_4">509</a> of the IPC and
     Section 3(1)(x) of the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act
     and sentenced to S.I. for 1 month and fine of Rs. 100/-,
     R.I. for 1 year and fine of Rs. 500/-, S.I. for 1 year and
     fine of Rs. 500/-, R.I. for 6 months and fine of Rs. 1000/-,
     with default stipulations.
</p><p id="p_3">2)         The facts, in short, giving rise to this appeal are
     that complainant Butan Saket, Sarpanch of Gram
     Panchayat    Sukwar    had         sent   a     written    report     to
     Commissioner Rewa alleging that on 17.10.2004 at about
     2:00 PM, when she was conducting a meeting of Gram
     Panchayat appellant along with co-accused Diwakar and
     some other persons came there, abused her and
     interrupted the proceedings of the meeting. It was
     further alleged that such type of incident had also taken
                                  [2]

                                             Criminal Appeal No. 1605/2007


     place on 20.9.2004, at that time also the appellants
     abused her and tore the register of proceedings of Gram
     Panchayat. The aforesaid report was sent by the
     complainant on 5.1.2005 to Commissioner, Rewa, same
     was forwarded to Superintendent of Police, Rewa. After
     enquiry, Crime No. 2/2005 has been registered for the
     offences under <a href="/doc/594493/" id="a_5">Sections 294</a>, <a href="/doc/180217/" id="a_6">506</a>, <a href="/doc/1208971/" id="a_7">353</a>, <a href="/doc/488479/" id="a_8">186</a> of the IPC
     and Section 3(1)(x) of the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities)
     Act against the appellants. After usual investigation, the
     appellants were arrested and charge sheeted before
     JMFC, who committed the case to Special Judge, Rewa.
</p><p id="p_4">3)           Learned Special Judge framed the charges under
     <a href="/doc/594493/" id="a_9">Sections 294</a>, <a href="/doc/68146/" id="a_10">509</a>, <a href="/doc/1208971/" id="a_11">353</a> of the IPC and Section 3(1)(x) of
     the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act.
</p><p id="p_5">4)           The appellants abjured the guilt and pleaded false
     implication.
</p><p id="p_6">5)           On appraisal of evidence on record, learned Special
     Judge     convicted   and   sentenced     the   appellants     as
     mentioned hereinabove, hence this appeal.
</p><p id="p_7">6)           Learned counsel for the appellants has submitted
     that the trial Court has committed illegality in not
     appreciating the evidence on record in its proper
     perspective. It is a case of belated FIR. Independent
     witnesses like Ashok Kumar Pathak (PW-3), Secretary of
     Gram Panchayat and Yaduvansh Prasad Pathak (PW-5)
     have not supported the version of the complainant,
     therefore, the conviction and sentence recorded by the
     trial Court be set aside and appellants be acquitted to the
     aforesaid charges.
</p><p id="p_8">7)           Learned Panel Lawyer for the State has supported
     the conviction and sentence recorded by the trial Court.
</p><p id="p_9">                                [3]

                                         Criminal Appeal No. 1605/2007


</p><p id="p_10">8)        I have heard the learned counsel for the parties at
     length, gone through the evidence recorded by the trial
     Court and other material on record. Complainant Butan
     Saket (PW-4) in her statement has stated that on the date
     of incident when she was conducting a meeting of
     Panchayat where Ashok Kumar Pathak (PW-3) and
     Yaduvansh Prasad Pathak (PW-5) were also present, at
     that time Diwakar came there, abused her, asked for
     register of Agenda and grabbed the same. Appellants also
     accompanied him and they also scuffled with her.
     However, eye witnesses Ashok Kumar Pathak (PW-3)as
     well as Yaduvansh Prasad Pathak (PW-5) have not
     supported the aforesaid version of the complainant.
     Yaduvansh Prasad Pathak specifically stated that Diwakar
     grabbed the register from Sarpanch Butan Saket.
     Though, they have been declared hostile in cross-
     examination by the prosecutor, however, nothing has
     been brought on record to support the case of the
     prosecution. It is also on record that the incident of
     grabbing the register had also taken place long back on
     20.9.2004 before this incident and the matter was not
     reported to anyone. Further, if any offence has been
     committed as per the statement of eye-witnesses, same
     was committed by co-accused Diwakar. So far as the
     appellants are concerned, merely their presence on the
     spot do not establish any offence against them. It is also
     very strange that the complainant was Sarpanch, she has
     not lodged any report at Police Station and sent a belated
     written FIR after about 2-3 months of the incident to the
     Commissioner.
</p><p id="p_11">9)        Considering    the   statements   of   aforesaid     eye
     witnesses and complainant, the statement of complainant
                                   [4]

                                              Criminal Appeal No. 1605/2007


       appears to be highly exaggerated and unbelievable. In my
       opinion, the trial Court has committed illegality in
       appreciating the evidence on record and in convicting the
       appellants under <a href="/doc/594493/" id="a_12">Sections 294</a>, <a href="/doc/1208971/" id="a_13">353</a>, <a href="/doc/68146/" id="a_14">509</a> of the IPC and
       Section 3(1)(x) of the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities)
       Act, same is liable to be set aside.
</p><p id="p_12">     10)     Consequently, the appeal is allowed. The conviction
       and sentence recorded by the trial Court under <a href="/doc/594493/" id="a_15">Sections
       294</a>, <a href="/doc/1208971/" id="a_16">353</a>, <a href="/doc/68146/" id="a_17">509</a> of the IPC and Section 3(1)(x) of the SC/ST
       (Prevention of Atrocities) Act against the appellants is
       hereby set aside. The appellants are acquitted to the
       aforesaid charges.
</p><p id="p_13">             The appellants are on bail, their bail bonds and
       surety bonds stand discharged.
</p><p id="p_14">             Record of the trial Court be sent back immediately
       along with the copy of this judgment for information and
       necessary action.
</p>
