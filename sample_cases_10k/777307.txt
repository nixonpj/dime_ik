       Industrial  Dispute-Abolition of contract system of  labour-
       Dispute	raised by regular workmen of  company-Reference	 to
       Tribunal, if competent-<a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_1">Industrial Disputes Act</a>, 1947 (14	 of
       1947), SS. 2 (k), 10.



HEADNOTE:
A dispute was raised by the respondents, the workmen of	 the
appellant company, with respect to contract labour  employed
by  it	for  cleaning  maintenance  work  at  the   refinery
including  premises and plant belonging to it.	They made  a
demand	for  abolition	of  the	 contract  system  and	 for
absorbing the workmen employed through the contractors	into
the regular service of the company.  The matter was referred
to the Tribunal under<a href="/doc/1669932/" id="a_2"> s. 10</a> of the Industrial Disputes	Act,
1947.  The company objected to the reference on the  grounds
(1) that it was incompetent inasmuch as there was no dispute
between	 it and the respondents and it was not open to	them
to raise a dispute with respect to the workmen of some other
employer, viz., the contractor, and (2) in any case, it	 was
for  the  company  to decide what was  the  best  method  of
carrying  on  its  business  and  the  Tribunal	 could	 not
interfere  with	 that  function	 of  the  management.	 The
Tribunal  held that the reference was competent and  on	 the
merits it was of opinion that the work which was being	done
through	 the contractor was necessary for the company to  be
done  daily, that doing this work through  annual  contracts
resulted in the deprivation of security of service and other
benefits,  privileges,	leave, etc., of the workmen  of	 the
contractor  and	 that  therefore the  contract	system	with
respect to this work should be abolished:
Held,  (1)  that  the dispute in the  present  case  was  an
industrial  dispute  within the meaning of<a href="/doc/1418464/" id="a_3"> s.  2(k)</a>  of	 the
Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, as interpreted in <a href="/doc/156482219/" id="a_4">Workmen  of
Dimakuchi  Tea	Estate v. The Management  of  Dimakuchi	 Tea
Estate</a>, [1958],
467
S.C.R. 1156, because (i) the respondents had a community  of
interest with the workmen of the contractor, (ii) they	hall
also  a	 substantial interest in-the subject-matter  of	 the
dispute in the sense that the class to which they  belonged,
namely,	 workmen,  was substantially affected  thereby,	 and
(iii) the company could give relief in the matter.
The reference was, accordingly, competent.
(2)  that  the	direction  given by the	 Tribunal  that	 the
contract  system  should  be  abolished	 was  just  in	 the
circumstances of the case and should not be interfered with.

</p><p id="p_5">       1960.  April 6. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by
       WANCHOO,	 J.-This  is  an  appeal by  special  leave  in	 an
       industrial  matter.   The appellant is The  Standard  Vacuum
       Refining	 Company of India Limited (hereinafter	called	the
       company).   A  dispute  was raised by  the  workmen  of	the
       company (hereinafter called the respondents) with respect to
       contract	 labour	 employed  by  the  company  for   cleaning
       maintenance of the refinery, (plant and premises)  belonging
       to the company.	The system in force in the company is  that
       this  work is given to contractors for a period of one  year
       from  October  1	 to September 30.  At  the  time  when	the
       reference was made the contract. was with Ramji Gordhan	and
       Company	for the period from October 1, 1957,  to  September
       30, 1958.  On April 27, 1957, the respondents made a  demand
       for  abolition of the contract system that prevailed in	the
       company	and for absorbing the workmen employed through	the
       contractors  into  the regular service of the  company  with
       retrospective  effect from the date of their  employment	 in
       the  company  through  the contractors.	 The  case  of	the
       respondents was that the contractor used to change sometimes
       from year to year with the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">       468</span>
       result that the workmen employed by the previous	 contractor
       were thrown out of employment.  As an instance, it was  said
       that  previous  to October 1, 1957, the	contract  was  with
       Gowri  Construction  Company.   That  company  employed	 67
       workmen to do the work.	But when the contract was given	 to
       Ramji Gordhan and Company, all these 67 workmen were  thrown
       out  of employment, though 40 of them were subsequently	re-
       employed	 as fresh employees by Ramji Gordhan  and  Company.
       The  result  of the system therefore was that there  was	 no
       security of service to the workmen who were in effect  doing
       the  work  of  the company.  Besides  the  contractors  were
       paying much less to the workmen than the amount paid by	the
       company	to  its unskilled regular  workmen.   Further,	the
       workmen	of  the	 contractors were  not	entitled  to  other
       benefits	 and  amenities such as provident  fund,  gratuity,
       bonus,  privilege leave, medical facilities  and	 subsidised
       food and housing to which the regular workmen of the company
       were entitled.  The work was of a permanent nature, but	the
       contract	 system	 was  introduced to deny  the  workmen	the
       rights  and  benefits  which the company	 gave  to  its	own
       workmen.
</p><p id="p_6">       The  dispute  was taken to the conciliation  officer.   When
       conciliation  failed,  the  Government of  Bombay  made	the
       following reference on May 13, 1958.
</p><p id="p_7">       "  The contract system for cleaning the premises	 and  plant
       should  be  abolished and workers working  in  the  refinery
       through	the Ramji Gordhan and Company should be treated	 as
       workers	of  the Standard Vacuum Refining Company  of  India
       Limited,	 Bombay,  and wage-scales, conditions  of  service,
       etc., that are applicable to the workers of the refinery	 be
       made  applicable	 to them.  Past service	 of  these  workers
       should be counted and they should be treated as continuously
       in  the	service of the Stanvac refinery from  the  date	 of
       their entertainment."
</p><p id="p_8">       The   company  resisted	the  claim  and	 raised	 two   main
       contentions.   In the first place it was contended that	the
       reference under<a href="/doc/1669932/" id="a_6"> s. 10</a> of the Industrial Disputes Act, No. 14
       of  1947 (hereinafter called the Act), was incompetent.	 In
       the second place it was contended
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">       469</span>
       that  the  work	done by the contractor's  workmen  was	not
       germane	to  the	 manufacturing process	and  was  therefore
       entrusted  to  the  contractor.	 If  the  workmen  of	the
       contractor  were	 not  satisfied	 with  the  conditions	 of
       service, they could take up the, matter with the	 contractor
       and  the	 company  had  nothing to do with  it.	As  to	the
       difference  between the wages and benefits and amenities	 of
       the  regular  workmen of the company  and  the  contractor's
       workmen,	 it  was  said that the work of	 the  two  sets	 of
       workmen	was very different and that in any case this was  a
       matter	between	 the  contractor  and  its  workmen.	The
       contractor was an independent employer and it was  incorrect
       to  say that the real employer was the company.	It was	for
       the  company to decide what was the best method of  carrying
       on  its	business  and the industrial  tribunal	should	not
       interfere with that function of the management.
       The tribunal held that the reference was competent.  On	the
       merits it was of -opinion that the work which was being done
       through the contractor was necessary for the company and had
       to  be  done  daily,  though  it	 was  not  a  part  of	the
       manufacturing  process.	It further held that doing of  this
       work through annual contracts resulted in the deprivation of
       security	 of service and other benefits, privileges,  leave,
       etc.,   for  the	 workmen  of  the  contractor.	  Therefore
       considering  the nature of the case it was of  opinion  that
       this was a proper case where a direction should be given	 to
       the  company to abolish the contract system with respect	 to
       this  work.   In the result the company	was  directed  with
       effect from November 1, 1958, to discontinue the practice of
       getting	this work done through contractors and to  have	 it
       done  through workmen engaged by itself.	 The other part	 of
       the  demand, namely, that all the workmen of the	 contractor
       should be taken over by the company and their past  services
       should  be  counted and that they should be given  the  same
       wage  scale  and	 conditions of service,	 etc.,	which  were
       applicable  to  the  regular  workmen  of  the  company	was
       rejected.   The	company	 was  further  directed	 to  engage
       regular workmen for this work and in so doing it was to give
       preference to the workmen employed by Ramji
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">       60</span>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">       470</span>
       Gordhan	and Company.  Wage-scale and other benefits  to	 be
       given  to  these	 workmen were left to  the  company  to	 be
       determined by it.
</p><p id="p_9">       Learned.	 Solicitor-General appearing for the company raised
       two  contentions before us, namely, (i) is this	dispute	 an
       industrial dispute and therefore the reference was competent
       ? and (ii) is the tribunal justified in interfering with the
       management function as to how it should get its work done ?
       Re. (i) :
</p><p id="p_10">       The  contention under this head is that there is no  dispute
       between the company and the respondents and that it was	not
       open  to the respondents to raise a dispute with respect	 to
       the  workmen  of some other employer (in	 this  case,  Ramji
       Gordhan	and  Company).	 Reliance in  this  connection	was
       placed  on the definition of " industrial dispute " in<a href="/doc/1418464/" id="a_7"> s.  2</a>
</p><p id="p_11">       (k) of the Act and the judgment of this Court in <a href="/doc/156482219/" id="a_8">Workmen	 of
       Dimakuchi  Tea  Estate v. The Management -of  Dimakuchi	Tea
       Estate</a> (1).  The definition of " industrial dispute " in
      <a href="/doc/1418464/" id="a_9"> s.   2</a> (k) requires three things-
</p><p id="p_12">       (i)  There should be a dispute or difference;
</p><p id="p_13">       (ii) The	 dispute or difference should be between  employers
       and  employers, or between employers and workmen or  between
       workmen and workmen;
</p><p id="p_14">       (iii)	 The  dispute or difference must be connected  with
       the employment or non-employment or the terms of	 employment
       or with the conditions of labour, of any person.
       The  first  part	 thus refers to the factum of  a  real	and
       substantial  dispute, the second part to the parties to	the
       dispute and the third to the subject-matter of the  dispute.
       The contention of the learned Solicitor General is  two-fold
       in  this	 connection, namely, (i) that there is no  real	 or
       substantial dispute between the company and the respondents,
       and (ii) that the subject matter of the dispute is such that
       it  cannot come within the terms of the definition in <a href="/doc/1418464/" id="a_10"> s.  2</a>
</p><p id="p_15">       (k).
</p><p id="p_16">       The  first submission can be disposed of shortly.  There	 is
       undoubtedly  a  real  and substantial  dispute  between	the
       company	 and  the  respondents	on  the	 question  of	the
       employment of contract-labour for the
       (1)  [1958] S.C.R. 1156.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">       471</span>
<p id="p_17">       work of the company.  The fact that the respondents who have
       raised this dispute are not employed on contract basis  will
       not  make  the dispute any the less a  real  or	substantial
       dispute	between	 them and the company as to the	 manner	 in
       which  the  work of the company should be carried  on.	The
       dispute	in  this  case is that the  company  should  employ
       workmen directly and not through contractors in carrying	 on
       its  work and this dispute is undoubtedly real and  substan-
       tial even though the regular workmen (i.e., the respondents)
       who have raised it are not employed on contract labour.	 In
       Dimakuchi  case	(1) to which reference has been	 made,	the
       dispute	was relating to an employee of the tea	estate	who
       was not a workman.  It was nevertheless held that this was a
       real  and  substantial dispute between the workmen  and	the
       company.	  How the work should be carried on is certainly  a
       matter  of  some	 importance  to	 the  workmen  and  in	the
       circumstances it cannot be said that this is not a real	and
       substantial  dispute  between the company and  its  workmen.
       Thus  out of the three ingredients of<a href="/doc/1418464/" id="a_11"> s. 2(k)</a> the  first	 is
       satisfied; the second also is ,satisfied because the dispute
       is between the company and the respondents ; it is the third
       ingredient which really calls for determination in the light
       of the decision in Dimakuchi case (1).
</p><p id="p_18">       <a href="/doc/1418464/" id="a_12">Section	2(k)</a>,  as it is worded, would allow  workmen  of  a
       particular  employer to raise a dispute connected  with	the
       employment or non-employment, or the terms of employment	 or
       with  the conditions of labour of any person.  It  was  this
       aspect of the matter which was considered in Dimakuchi  case
       (1) and it was held that the words " any person " used in<a href="/doc/1418464/" id="a_13"> s.
       2(k)</a> would not justify the workmen of a particular  employer
       to  raise a dispute about any one in the world, though-	the
       words  " any person " in that provision may not	be  equated
       with  the  words " any workman ". The test therefore  to	 be
       applied in determining the scope of the words " any person "
       in <a href="/doc/1418464/" id="a_14"> s.  2(k)</a>  was  stated in  the  following  words  at	pp.
       1174-75:-
</p><p id="p_19">       "  If, therefore, the dispute is a collective  dispute,	the
       party raising the dispute must have either a direct interest
       in the subject-matter of dispute or a
       (1) [1958] S. C. R. 1156.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">       472</span>
<p id="p_20">       substantial interest therein in the sense that the class	 to
       which the aggrieved party belongs is substantially  affected
       thereby.	 It is the community of interest of the class as  a
       whole-class of employers or class of workmen-which furnishes
       the  real nexus between the dispute and the parties  to	the
       dispute.	 We see no insuperable difficulty in the  practical
       application  of this test.  In a case where the party  to  a
       dispute is composed of aggrieved workmen themselves and	the
       subject-matter  of  the dispute relates to them	or  any	 of
       them,  they clearly have a direct interest in  the  dispute.
       Where,  however, the party to the dispute also  composed	 of
       workmen espouse the cause of another person whose employment
       or  non-employment,  etc., may  prejudicially  affect  their
       interest,  the  workmen have a substantial interest  in	the
       subject-matter  of dispute.  In both such cases the  dispute
       is an industrial dispute.  "
</p><p id="p_21">       We  have therefore to see whether the respondents  who  have
       raised  this dispute have a direct interest in the  subject-
       matter  of the dispute or a substantial interest therein	 in
       the sense that the class to which the respondents belong	 is
       substantially   affected	 thereby  and  whether	 there	 is
       community  of  interest between the  respondents	 and  those
       whose cause they have espoused.	There can be no doubt  that
       there  is  (community of interest in this case  between	the
       respondents  and the workmen of Ramji Gordhan  and  Company.
       They  belong to the same class and they do the work  of	the
       same  employer and it is possible for the -company  to  give
       the   relief  which  the	 respondents  are  claiming.	The
       respondents have in our opinion also a substantial  interest
       in the subject-matter of the dispute, namely, the  abolition
       of  the	contract system in doing work of  this	kind.	The
       learned Solicitor-General particularly emphasised that there
       was  no	question of the interest of the	 respondents  being
       prejudicially affected by the employment or nonemployment or
       the terms of service or conditions of labour of the  workmen
       of  Ramji  Gordhan and Company and placed  reliance  on	the
       words " may prejudicially affect their interest "  appearing
       in the observations quoted above.  We may, however,  mention
       that
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">       473</span>
       the  test laid down is that the workmen espousing the  cause
       should  have a substantial interest in the subjectmatter	 of
       the dispute, and it was only when illustrating the practical
       application of the test that this Court used the words  "may
       prejudicially  affect  their  interest  ".  Besides  it	 is
       contended  by Mr. Gokhale for the respondents that  even	 if
       prejudicial effect on the interest of the workmen  espousing
       the   cause  is	necessary,  this  is  a,  case	where	the
       respondents'  interest  may  be	prejudicially  affected	 in
       future  in  case the contract system of work is	allowed	 to
       prevail	in  this  branch of the work of	 the  company.	 He
       submits	that if the company can carry on this part  of	the
       work by contract system it may introduce the same system	 in
       other  branches of its work which are now being done by	its
       regular	workmen.  We do not think it necessary to  go  into
       this aspect of the matter as we have already indicated  that
       prejudicial  effect is only one of the illustrations of	the
       practical  application  of the test laid down  in  Dimakuchi
       case  (1), viz., substantial interest in the sense that	the
       class to which the aggrieved party belongs is  substantially
       affected	 thereby.   It	seems  to  us  therefore  that	the
       respondents have a community of interest with the workmen of
       Ramji Gordhan and Company who are in effect working for	the
       same employer.  They have also a substantial interest in the
       subject-matter of the dispute in the sense that the class to
       which   they  belong  (namely,  workmen)	 is   substantially
       affected	 thereby.  Finally the company can give	 relief	 in
       the  matter.   We  are therefore of  opinion  that  all	the
       ingredients  of<a href="/doc/1418464/" id="a_15"> s. 2(k)</a> as interpreted in Dimakuchi  case(1)
       are present in this case and the dispute between the parties
       is an industrial dispute and the reference was competent.
       Re. (ii) :
</p><p id="p_22">       We  now	come  to  the question	whether	 the  tribunal	was
       justified  in giving the direction for the abolition of	the
       contract	 system in the manner in which it has done  so.	 In
       dealing	with  this question it may be relevant to  bear	 in
       mind   that  industrial	adjudication  generally	 does	not
       encourage the employment of contract labour in modern times.
       As  has	been observed by the Royal Commission on  Labour  "
       whatever the merits of the system
       (1) [1958] S. C. R. 1156.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">       474</span>
<p id="p_23">       in  primitive times, it is now desirable, if the	 management
       is  to discharge completely the complex responsibility  laid
       upon  it by law and by equity, that the manager should  have
       full  control over the selection, hours of work and  payment
       of  the	workers ". The same opinion has been  expressed	 by
       several	Labour	Enquiry Committees appointed  in  different
       States.	 We  agree-that	 whenever a dispute  is	 raised	 by
       workmen	in regard to the employment of contract	 labour	 by
       any  employer  it  would be necessary for  the  tribunal	 to
       examine	the  merits of the dispute apart from  the  general
       consideration that contract labour should not be encouraged,
       and that in a given case the decision should rest not merely
       on theoretical or abstract objections to contract labour but
       also on the terms and conditions on which contract labour is
       employed and the grievance made by the employees in  respect
       thereof.	 As in other matters of industrial adjudication	 so
       in  the	case  of contract labour  theoretical  or  academic
       considerations  may be relevant but their importance  should
       not  be	overestimated.	Let us then consider  the  contract
       labour system in the present case.
</p><p id="p_24">       The contract in this case related to four matters.  But	the
       reference   is	confined  to  one  only,   viz.,   cleaning
       maintenance  work  at the refinery  including  premises	and
       plant  and  we shall deal with that only.  So far  as'  this
       work  is	 concerned, it is incidental to	 the  manufacturing
       process	and is necessary for it and of a  perennial  nature
       which  must be done every day.  Such work is generally  done
       by  workmen in the regular employ of the employer and  there
       should  be no difficulty in having regular workmen for  this
       kind of work.  The matter would be different if the work was
       of intermittent or temporary nature or was so little that it
       would  not be possible to employ full-time workmen  for	the
       purpose.	 Under the circumstances the order of the  tribunal
       appears	to  be	just  and there are  no	 good  reasons	for
       interfering with it.
</p><p id="p_25">       Our attention in this connection was drawn to <a href="/doc/562979/" id="a_16">D.	 Macropollo
       And  Co.	 (P)  Ltd.  v.	D.  Macropollo	And  Co.  (P)  Ltd.
       Employees'  Union</a>  (1) and it was urged	that  the  tribunal
       should not have interfered with the
       (1)  A.I.R. 1958 S.C. 1012.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">       475</span>
<p id="p_26">       management's  manner  of having its work done  in  the  most
       economical  and convenient way that it thought  proper.	 It
       was pointed out that this was not a case where the  contract
       system  was a camouflage and the workmen of  the	 contractor
       were really the workmen of the company.	It may be  accepted
       that  the contractor in the present case is  an	independent
       person and the system is genuine and there is no question of
       the company carrying on this work itself and camouflaging it
       as  if it was done through contractors in order to pay  less
       to the workmen.	But the fact that the contract in this case
       is  a bona fide contract would not necessarily mean that	 it
       should  not be touched by the industrial tribunals.  If	the
       contract had been mala fide and a cloak for suppressing	the
       fact  that  the	workmen	 were really  the  workmen  of	the
       company, the tribunal would have been justified in  ordering
       the  company  to take over the entire body  of  workmen	and
       treat  it as its own workmen.  But because the  contract	 in
       this  case  was bona fide the tribunal has not  ordered	the
       company	to  take over the entire body of workmen.   It	has
       left  to it to decide for itself how many workmen it  should
       employ  and on what terms and has merely directed that  when
       selection  is being made preference should be given  to	the
       workmen	employed by the present contractor.  In	 Macropollo
       case  (1), this Court held that the reorganisation had  been
       adopted by the employer for reasons of economy and  conveni-
       ence  and was bona fide.	 In that case the main business	 of
       the  concern  was the selling agency  of	 various  cigarette
       manufacturing  concerns.	  Before 1946 the concern  used	 to
       employ  distributors for the purpose and these  distributors
       used to employ salesmen.	 In 1946 there were communal  riots
       in Calcutta and therefore the concern took over the salesmen
       in  its	direct employment in order to  reorganise  them	 on
       communal	 basis	in the then prevailing	circumstances.	 In
       1954 the concern decided to close down its own outdoor sales
       department and revert to the distributor system.	 It was	 in
       that context that certain workmen had to be retrenched,	and
       this  Court held that the reorganisation scheme	adopted	 in
       1954 for reasons of economy and convenience was bona fide
       (1)  A.I.R. 1958 S.C. 1012.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">       476</span>
<p id="p_27">       and  if	it resulted in retrenchment  that  was	inevitable.
       These  facts  would  show  that	in  that  case	there	was
       reorganisation  of the business resulting  in  retrenchment.
       In  the	present	 case no such thing  arises  and  the  only
       question for decision is whether the work which is perennial
       and  must go on from day to day and which is incidental	and
       necessary  for  the  work  of  the  refinery  and  which	 is
       sufficient  to  employ a considerable  number  of  wholetime
       workmen	and  which is being done in most  concerns  through
       regular workmen should be allowed to be done by contractors.
       Considering  the	 nature of the work and the  conditions	 of
       service	in  the	 present case we are of	 opinion  that	the
       tribunal's  decision is right and no interference is  called
       for, except that the date ;should now be changed, for such a
       direction cannot be put into force with retrospective effect
       from November 1, 1958.  It appears that a few months  remain
       before  the present contract will come to an end.  We  think
       that  for these few months the present system may  continue.
       We therefore dismiss the appeal with this modification  that
       the  order of the tribunal will be carried into effect  from
       such  date  on which the present contract in  force  in	the
       company	comes  to an end.  The respondents will	 get  their
       costs from the company.
