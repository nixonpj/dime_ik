                            ORDER ON BOARD
22.06.2016

</p><p id="p_4">1)     In an application filed by Ramkumar Rajput and others /

       applicants herein, the Succession Court in exercise of

       powers conferred under <a href="/doc/994957/" id="a_1">Section 373</a> of the Indian

       Succession Act, 1925 (hereafter, the Act, 1925), granted

       succession certificate by order dated 30.04.2013.

</p><p id="p_5">2)     Non-applicants 1 and 2 have filed an application under

       <a href="/doc/202684/" id="a_2">Section 383</a> of the Act, 1925 for revocation of the

       succession certificate, inter alia on the ground that the

       succession certificate was obtained by concealing

       material facts from the Court without impleading them,

       therefore, the said certificate is liable to be revoked.

</p><p id="p_6">3)     Upon service of notice, present applicants filed an

       application under Order 7 Rule 11 of the Code of Civil
                                                       CR- 21 of 2016

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                3</span>


     Procedure stating that the certificate granted by learned

     Succession Court on 30.04.2013 is not liable to be

     revoked and further pleaded that the said certificate has

     already been used and the amount therein has already

     been obtained by them. It was further pleaded that the

     question of title raised in the application cannot be

     decided under <a href="/doc/202684/" id="a_3">Section 383</a> of the Act, 1925, therefore,

     the application filed on behalf of non-applicants 1 and 2

     be rejected being not maintainable under law.

</p><p id="p_7">4)   The application filed by the applicants under Order 7

     Rule 11 of the CPC was replied by non-applicants 1 and

     2/plaintiffs   stating         inter    alia    that      the

     applicants/defendants have obtained the certificate by

     suppressing material facts and it can be revoked under

     <a href="/doc/202684/" id="a_4">Section 383</a> of the Act, 1925. It was further pleaded that

     non-applicants 1 and 2         were deliberately not   made

     party in the application for succession certificate and as

     such, application under Order 7 Rule 11 of the CPC

     deserves to be rejected.
</p>
<p id="p_8">5)   Learned Succession Court vide its impugned order dated

     27.10.2015 rejected the application finding inter alia that

     such an application would require recording of evidence

     and therefore, the application cannot be entertained.
</p><p id="p_9">                                                          CR- 21 of 2016

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                 4</span>


</p><p id="p_10">6)   Shri ML Sakat, appearing for the applicants submits that

     the order passed by learned Succession Court is

     contrary to law as such the said Court has committed

     judicial error in rejecting their application.

</p><p id="p_11">7)   Shri HB Agrawal, Senior Advocate appearing for

     non-applicants 1 and 2 submits that the order passed by

     learned succession Court is strictly in accordance with

     law and no interference is warranted in exercise of

     jurisdiction vested in this Court under Section 115 of the

     CPC.
</p>
<p id="p_12">8)   I have heard learned counsel for the parties and also

     considered their submissions.
</p>
<p id="p_13">9)   It is not disputed that non-applicants 1 and 2/plaintiffs

     who have filed application for revocation of succession

     certificate under <a href="/doc/202684/" id="a_5">Section 383</a> of the             Act, 1925 are

     daughters of Kushiram Rajput who was brother of

     deceased Gangaram.           The dispute relates to land

     belongs to Gangaram, who died issue less. It is also not

     in dispute that in Succession Case No.10/13 which was

     decided on 30.04.2013, non-applicants 1 and 2 /plaintiffs

     were not made party and the case was decided in their

     absence. They have filed an application under <a href="/doc/202684/" id="a_6">Section

     383</a> (b) and (e) of the Act, 1925.
</p><p id="p_14">                                                             CR- 21 of 2016

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                    5</span>



</p><p id="p_15">10)   Present applicants/defendants' objections are that the

      revocation of Succession Certificate is not maintainable

      under the law and deserves to be rejected. Since non-

      applicants 1 and 2 have filed an application under

      <a href="/doc/202684/" id="a_7">Section 383</a> of the Act, 1925 for revocation of

      Succession      Certificate        on   permissible     grounds,

      enumerated in Clauses (a) to (e) of the Act, 1925, it

      cannot be held to be non-maintainable.             Next objection

      raised is that the application is not maintainable and it is

      beyond the scope of <a href="/doc/202684/" id="a_8">Section 383</a> of the Act, 1925 and

      regular Civil Suit is maintainable.


</p><p id="p_16">11)   On perusal of <a href="/doc/202684/" id="a_9">Section 383</a> of the Act, 1925, earlier,

      certificate was granted without impleading non-applicants

      1 and 2 (plaintiffs) and it is their case that concealing

      material facts from the Court and thereby the succession

      certificate has been obtained in their favour, as such, it

      cannot be held that their application for revocation is not

      maintainable.
</p>
<p id="p_17">
</p><p id="p_18">12)   For the aforesaid reasons, I do not find any jurisdictional

      error in the impugned order and thereby, it is dismissed

      leaving   the    parties      to    bear   their    own     costs.
</p><p id="p_19">                                                     CR- 21 of 2016

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                     6</span>



        However, Succession Court is directed to expedite the

        trial of said application.
