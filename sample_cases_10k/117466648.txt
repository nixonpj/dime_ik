    This appeal coming for Admission this day,
N.KUMAR J., delivered the following

                     JUDGMENT
</pre>

<p id="p_1">      This second appeal is preferred by the defendant

against the concurrent findings of the both the courts

below to the effect that he has entered into agreement to

sell the suit property in favour of the plaintiff and that

the plaintiff was ready and willing to perform his part of

contract and therefore, granting of decree of specific

performance.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">      2. The subject matter of the suit is land bearing

Sy.No.209/E     measuring        08   acres,     Sy.No.209/B

measuring 04 acres and Sy.No.210/B measuring 08

acres 17 guntas all situated at Hirekotnekal village, Tq.

Manvi. The case of the plaintiff was that the defendants

are   the   owners   in   possession    of     suit   schedule

properties. They agreed to sell the properties for total

consideration of Rs.4,90,000/-. The agreement of sale

was executed on 20.08.2001. The defendants received a
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                 4</span>

sum of Rs.4,50,000/- towards the part payment, out of

the   total   consideration     and       balance   amount     of

Rs.40,000/- was agreed to be paid within two years

from the date of the agreement. The defendants agreed

to deliver the suit schedule properties free from

encumbrances. The plaintiff called upon the defendant

No.1 to execute registered sale deed in his favour. The

plaintiff was ready and willing to pay balance sale

consideration. The defendants went on postponing the

execution     of   the   sale   deed.     The   plaintiff   again

approached the defendant in the month of June 2002

and   requested     to   receive    the    consideration.    The

defendants postponed the execution of the sale deed.

Therefore, the plaintiff was constrained to file the suit

for specific performance of agreement of sale. During

the pendency of the suit, the defendant No.1 sold Sy.No.

209/E in favour of S.Ramudu to an extent of 04 acres

under registered Sale deed dated 17.02.2004. However,

before he could be impleaded he died, therefore, his

Legal representatives are impleaded as defendant Nos. 2
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                5</span>

and 3.       After service of summons the defendant No.1

filed a detailed written statement. However, defendant

Nos. 2 and 3 have not filed any statement.


</p><p id="p_4">        3.     The defendant No.1 contended that he is not

absolute owner of the suit schedule properties. He

raised loans from private persons and also from

nationalised banks by hypothecating the suit schedule

properties. The said loans are not cleared. Therefore, the

suit is not maintainable. He further contended that an

agreement of sale executed on 19.08.2001 in favour of

the plaintiff agreeing to sell the suit schedule properties

for a sum of Rs.30.00 lakhs and received a sum of

Rs.4.50       lakhs   as   a   part/advance   payment    of

consideration. Under the terms of the agreement the

plaintiff has to pay balance consideration of Rs.25,50

lakhs    on or before 19.08.2001 and get the sale deed

registered. The said original deed of agreement is in

possession of the plaintiff. The plaintiff is not an

agriculturist. He is a Government school head master.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                             6</span>

As per clause No.4 of the aforesaid agreement on

20.08.2001, the defendant has executed one more

registered agreement of sale in the interest and benefit

of the plaintiff's account maintenance. Therefore, the

plaintiff has not come to the court with clean hands. He

has suppressed the earlier agreement and has filed the

suit to enrich himself.   He has also denied that the

plaintiff was ready and willing to perform his part of the

contract. The market value of the suit schedule

properties is Rs.1.75 lakhs to 1.90 lakhs per acre. The

defendant is ready to perform his part of the contract if

the plaintiff pays the balance consideration of Rs.25,50

lakhs as per the agreement. The plaintiff is not entitled

for refund of Rs.4.50 lakhs with interest at 24% per

annum.
</p>
<p id="p_5">
</p><p id="p_6">     4.    On the aforesaid contentions the trial court

has framed as many as 6 issues and other additional 5

issues. During the pendency of the suit the plaintiff

died, his legal representatives were brought on record.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                7</span>

Plaintiff's widow was examined as PW 1 and one witness

Tajuddin was examined as PW 2 and 10 documents are

produced which are marked as Ex.P-1 to P-10.             On

behalf of the defendants, 1st defendant examined as DW

1 and also a witness Gangadhar Reddy is examined as

DW 2. The trial court on appreciation of oral and

documentary evidence on record held that the suit is

not bad for non joinder of necessary parties. The

plaintiff has proved that the defendant has agreed to

sell the suit schedule properties for total consideration

of Rs.4.90 lakhs and that he has paid Rs.4.50 lakhs in

part consideration under an agreement of sale dated

20.08.2000. The plaintiff has also proved that he was

ready and willing to perform his part of contract. He was

ready to pay Rs.40,000/- to take the sale deed. The sale

deed executed by defendant No.1 in favour of S.

Ramudu on 17.02.2004 being hit by doctrine of Lis

pendency is not binding on the plaintiff. The plaintiff is

entitled   to   decree   for   specific   performance.   The

defendant has failed to establish the agreement of sale
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                               8</span>

dated 19.08.2001 for consideration of Rs.30.00 lakhs as

alleged by him. He further failed to prove that the as

per the said agreement the plaintiff has to pay Rs.25.50

lakhs. Therefore, he decreed the suit of the plaintiff as

prayed for.
</p>
<p id="p_7">
</p><p id="p_8">     5.       Aggrieved by the judgement and decree of

the trial court, the defendant No.1 has preferred an

appeal before lower appellate court. The lower appellate

court on re-appreciation of entire evidence on record

formulated the the following point for consideration.

</p><p id="p_9">     Whether      the   appellant   proves   that   the
     judgement and decree passed by the trial
     court is capricious, perverse and is without
     application of mind to the right preposition
     of law and thereby it is liable to be set aside
     and is required to be remanded?
</p>
<p id="p_10">

It held the said point in favour of plaintiff and against

the defendant and accordingly dismissed the appeal.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                             9</span>

</p><p id="p_11">     6.    Aggrieved by the said judgement and decree

the defendant is in second appeal. The learned counsel

appearing for the defendant contends in the first place

the plaintiff has suppressed the earlier agreement of

sale for sum of Rs.30.00 lakhs. Secondly, the 1st

defendant was not the absolute owner of the property,

therefore, no decree for specific performance could have

been executed. Lastly it was contended that the market

value of the property as mentioned in the said

agreement is inadequate and the plaintiff was not ready

and willing to perform his part of contract.


</p><p id="p_12">     7.    From the material on record it is clear that

the execution of the suit agreement is not disputed,

which is a registered document. The receipt of Rs.4.50

lakhs from the plaintiff for sale of the suit schedule

properties is also not in dispute.       Defendant No.1

contends that he has received Rs.4.50 lakhs under

agreement dated 19.08.2001, whereas the plaintiff says

that he paid on 20.08.2001. Neither the original    nor
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                            10</span>

copy of the agreement has been produced before the

court below. In the absence of any such material, the

trial court was justified in holding that defendant has

failed to prove agreement dated 19.08.2001. Once the

suit agreement is proved, the total consideration

payable was Rs.4.90 lakhs and Rs.4.50 lakhs has been

paid on the date under the agreement of sale. The

balance payable was Rs.40,000/- and the evidence on

record shows that the plaintiff was ready and willing to

perform his part of contract and was ready to pay

Rs.40,000/- to take the sale deed. It is the defendant

No.1 who avoided to receive and to execute the sale

deed. Therefore, the finding recorded by the both the

courts below     that the suit agreement is proved,

consideration payable Rs.4.90 lakhs, out of which

Rs.4.50 lakhs is paid and the plaintiff was ready to pay

the balance of Rs.40,000/- to take the sale deed cannot

be found fault with. It is the concurrent finding of both

the courts below based on legal evidence. Therefore, no

case of interference is made out. Insofar as suppressing
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                            11</span>

the earlier agreement is concerned, the said agreement

is not seen the light of the day, even to this date and

therefore, the findings recorded by the courts below that

no such agreement is produced and said finding cannot

be found fault with.   Insofar as the contention of the

defendant No.1 that he is not the absolute owner of the

suit schedule properties is concerned, the defendant

No.1 has failed to prove the same. The plaintiff under

the agreement of sale has agreed to purchase the

defendants properties and whatever right the defendant

has in the property accrues to the plaintiff. If persons

other than the plaintiff have any right in the property it

is for them to work out their remedy. On that ground

specific performance cannot be denied.         Regarding

valuation of the properties is concerned, when the

plaintiff under the registered agreement, values the

properties and the defendant failed to prove that there

was earlier agreement in which plaintiff has agreed to

pay Rs.30.00 lakhs, such contention has no substance.

Under these circumstances, no substantial question of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                            12</span>

law   which arises for consideration in the second

appeal. No merits. Hence, the appeal is dismissed.
