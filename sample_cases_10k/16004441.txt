</p>
<p id="p_2">                                  The Court was inclined to proceed with the

                 matter as it has been adjourned on a number of occasions

                 earlier, but the moot question as to whether the Economic

                 Offences Unit has acted as per any fixed guidelines with

                 regard to any complaint received by it prior to instituting a

                 case by way of preliminary enquiry or otherwise and whether

                 the same has been uniformly followed in all cases being

                 pursued by the Economic Offences Unit, the same does not

                 seem to have been addressed by the learned counsel

                 representing the Economic Offences Unit.

              appropriate further counter affidavit bringing on record such

              materials,       this     Court      deems         it   appropriate      that   a

              applicable to the Economic Offences Unit and the Special

              Vigilance Unit which have been formed with the same object of

              checking corruption involving public funds and further

              whether the procedure prescribed in the Vigilance Manual of

              the State Government is being uniformly applied in all cases
