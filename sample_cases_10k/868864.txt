PRASANT KUMAR SAHOO                             ..............             Petitioner


                                  .Vrs.

<pre id="pre_2">STATE OF ORISSA                                ...............             Opp.Party.


CRIMINAL PROCEDURE CODE, 1973 (ACT NO.2 OF 1974) - SEC.439.


    For Petitioner - M/s. J.Patnaik, J.K.Panda &amp; S.Panigrahi.
    For Opp.Party - Mr. Goutam Mishra,
                     Addl.Standing Counsel.
M.M. DAS, J.        The petitioner in this application under <a href="/doc/1290514/" id="a_1">section 439</a> Cr.P.C. has approached this
</pre><p id="p_2">Court for the second time for grant of bail. He is a co-accused in C.T. Case No. 1 of 2009
corresponding to G.R. Case No. 1991 of 2007 arising out of Saheednagar P.S. Case No. 155 of 2007
now pending trial in the court of the learned Sessions Judge, Khurda at Bhubaneswar. Accusation of
commission of offence under <a href="/doc/695990/" id="a_2">sections 364(A)</a>/<a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_3">302</a>/<a href="/doc/386021/" id="a_4">201</a>/<a href="/doc/1897847/" id="a_5">120-B</a> IPC read with <a href="/doc/73862/" id="a_6">sections 25</a> and <a href="/doc/244673/" id="a_7">27</a> of the
Arms Act has been made against the accused persons.
</p>

<p id="p_3">2.      This Court earlier, while dealing with the prayer for bail made by the petitioner in BLAPL No.
 5766 of 2008, by order dated 18.6.2008 taking note of the allegations made by the prosecution
 recorded as follows:-
</p><p id="p_4">               "The offence is a very heinous one involving kidnap of two persons and murder of at
least one of them. The whereabouts of Rasmi Ranjan is not yet known nor it is known whether he is
dead or alive. Contrary to the assertion of the learned counsel for the petitioner, the present petitioner
has been named not only by witness Pravat Nath, but also witness Prasant Kumar Mohapatra and
Pradip Kumar Mohapatra, who are none other than the brothers of Rasmi Ranjan.
</p><p id="p_5">              Having regard to the nature and gravity of the offence I do not feel to grant bail to the
petitioner and accordingly the BLAPL is rejected."
</p>
<p id="p_6">Subsequent to rejection of the prayer for bail made by the petitioner, he again approached this Court
in BLAPL No. 16440 of 2008 making a prayer to release him on interim bail. By orders passed in the
said bail application on 10.12.2008, the petitioner was released on interim bail for a period of 60 days
and again in Misc. Case No. 265 of 2009 filed in the said bail application, the petitioner was released
for a further period of 60 days on bail.
</p><p id="p_7">3.      Mr. J. Patnaik, learned senior counsel appearing for the petitioner vehemently urged that the
petitioner has remained in custody since more than two years as alleged by the petitioner. He further
 submitted that in connection with the self-same offence, another case was lodged in Bolangir Town
Police Station, registered as G.R. Case No. 33 of 2008, in which, the witness Prabhat Nath, who is
alleged to have implicated the petitioner in this case, gave a statement under <a href="/doc/497457/" id="a_8">section 164</a> Cr.P.C.
before the Magistrate on 28.10.2007 where, he has not implicated the petitioner and the petitioner has
been granted bail in the said case. Mr. Patnaik further submitted that other cogent grounds for passing
an order in favour of the petitioner by releasing him on bail are that in the meantime, the three
witnesses, whose statements were relied upon for rejecting the previous prayer for bail made by the
petitioner in order dated 18.6.2008 in BLAPL No. 5766 of 2008, i.e., Prabhat Nath, Prasant Kumar
Mohapatra and Pradip Kumar Mohapatra, have been examined in the meantime during the course of
trial of the sessions case. The said witnesses have not implicated the petitioner with the alleged
offence in any manner. The other ground canvassed on behalf of the petitioner is that, three of the co-
accused persons, namely, Amit Kumar Choudhury, Gayatri Biswal and Jajati Keshari Biswal have
been directed to be released on bail by this Court in BLAPL Nos. 9569 of 2008, 4670 of 2009 and 275
of 2009 respectively.
</p>

<p id="p_8">4.     The prosecution has alleged that on 28.5.2007, the complainant Babu @ Dilip Kumar Behera
lodged an information before the I.I.C., Saheednagar Police Station stating that on 25.5.2007 at about
2.30 P.M., his brother-in-law Chinu @ Rashmi Ranjan Mohapatra and his driver - Naba Kishore
Mohanta have been kidnapped from Bhubaneswar with their INNOVA Car while they were coming to
Bhubaneswar for purchasing marble from Sri Ram Marbles situated at Cuttack-Puri road,
Bhubaneswar. It was further stated in the F.I.R. that in the same night at 10.00 P.M. the kidnappers
made a call demanding a ransom from the family members of Rashmi Ranjan amounting to Rs. 2.00
crores for their release, who also cautioned that this should not be informed to the police. On the
basis of the said report, the I.I.C. Saheednagar Police Station registered a case for commission of
alleged offence under <a href="/doc/695990/" id="a_9">section 364</a> (A) IPC. During the course of investigation, the INNOVA Car was
recovered from Dhanbad Railway Station and on the next day, the dead body of the driver Naba
Kishore Mohanta was also recovered by the OIC of Sonahat Police Station, Ranchi and a case was
registered in the said Police Station under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_10">sections 302</a>/<a href="/doc/386021/" id="a_11">201</a>/<a href="/doc/695990/" id="a_12">364(A)</a>/<a href="/doc/1897847/" id="a_13">120-B</a> IPC read with <a href="/doc/73862/" id="a_14">sections 25</a>
and <a href="/doc/244673/" id="a_15">27</a> of the Arms Act. Thereafter, on completion of the investigation, the police has submitted a
charge sheet against the petitioner and the other co-accused persons for the commission of the above
alleged offences. By now, it has been established that said Rashmi Ranjan was also murdered. In
the meantime, the case has been committed and is being tried by the learned Sessions Judge, Khurda
at Bhubaneswar.
</p><p id="p_9">5.      Mr. G.Mishra, learned counsel for the State submitted that it is not correct on the part of the
petitioner to state that the three witnesses named in the order of rejection of bail by this Court earlier,
have not implicated the petitioner. He further submitted that the co-accused persons stand on different
footing altogether and with regard to the allegation of conspiracy, Mr. Mishra submitted that as laid
down by the Supreme Court in the case of <a href="/doc/667073/" id="a_16">Kehar Singh and others v. The State (Delhi Admn</a>.) AIR
1988 SC 1883, conspiracy is always hatched in secrecy, which can only be revealed on examination
of the prosecution witnesses during trial of a case, thus establishing the commission of the said
offence by the accused persons. Mr. Mishra further submitted that this Court having rejected the
prayer for bail of the petitioner earlier on the ground that the petitioner has been implicated in
commission of the alleged offence by the witnesses examined during investigation, which, in other
words, amounts to finding of a prima facie case against the petitioner, it would not be appropriate for
this Court to appreciate the evidence adduced by those three witnesses during the course of trial to
find out as to whether the petitioner has been implicated with the alleged offence, as this would
influence the trial of the sessions case. He further contended that even considering the statements of
the said three witnesses, it would be seen that the petitioner has been directly implicated. The copies
of the depositions of the above named three witnesses were produced before this Court.
</p><p id="p_10">6.      On perusal of the evidence of Pradip Kumar Barik adduced before the learned Sessions
Judge, it appears, prima facie, that he has named the petitioner to have been involved in commission
 of the alleged offence. The petitioner has also been named by the witness Parsuram Samal. The
witness Prabhat Nath in his deposition before the learned Sessions Judge has also implicated the
petitioner. Therefore, the contention that the said witnesses have not named the petitioner is not at all
correct. Further, as contended by Mr. G. Mishra, learned counsel for the State, this Court is of the view
that at this juncture when the sessions trial is in progress, it would not be appropriate for this Court to
appreciate the evidence adduced before the court below and, more so, when the other prosecution
witnesses are yet to be examined, for considering an application for bail which was earlier rejected by
this Court.
</p><p id="p_11">7.    With regard to the statement recorded under <a href="/doc/497457/" id="a_17">section 164</a> Cr.P.C. of the said Prabhat Nath, in the
case registered at Bolangir, this Court is of the view that the said Prabhat Nath has not been
confronted with the said statement recorded under <a href="/doc/497457/" id="a_18">section 164</a> Cr.P.C. during his cross-examination in
the present session trial, and, therefore, the said statement has no bearing on this case for
consideration of the prayer for bail.
</p><p id="p_12">8.      Mr. Mishra, learned counsel for the State relied upon the judgment in the case of <a href="/doc/1464126/" id="a_19">Kumari
Suman Pandey v. State of Uttar Pradesh and another</a>, (2007)12 SCC 364 and submitted that the
Supreme Court in the said case has laid down the guidelines with regard to the facts, which are to be
considered by a court hearing an application for bail. In the said case, the Supreme Court held that a
court granting bail to an accused should indicate in the order the reasons for prima facie concluding
why bail is being granted, particularly where an accused is charged of having committed a serious
offence and it is necessary for the courts dealing with application for bail to consider among other
circumstances, the nature of accusation and the severity of punishment in case of conviction and the
nature of supporting evidence; reasonable apprehension of tampering of the witness or apprehension
of threat to the complaint and prima facie satisfaction of the court in support of the charge. The
Supreme Court also indicated that any order dehors such reasons suffers from non-application of
mind as was noted by it in the cases of <a href="/doc/836557/" id="a_20">Rama Govind Upadhyay v. Sudarshan Singh</a> (2002)3
SCC 598 and <a href="/doc/1851011/" id="a_21">Gajanand Agarwal v. State of Orissa</a>,(2006)12 SCC 131.
</p><p id="p_13">9.       Law with regard to dealing with second bail application or consecutive bail applications was
vividly dealt with by this Court, referring to various judgments of the apex Court, in the case of Sri
Braja Bhai v. state of Orissa, 2008 (II) OLR 161. It would be profitable to mention here that though
an argument was advanced on behalf of the petitioner that grant of bail to other co-accused persons is
a ground for considering a second bail application of an accused as it is found that the said co-
accused persons, who have been released on bail clearly stand on different footing than the petitioner,
this Court is not inclined to consider the said contention in the present case. The Supreme Court has
categorically laid down in the case of <a href="/doc/1521407/" id="a_22">Kalyan Chandra Sarkar v. Rajesh Ranjan</a> alias Pappu Yadav
and another (2005) 2 SCC 42 that even though there is room for filing of a subsequent bail
application in cases where earlier bail applications have been rejected, the same can be done, if
there is a change in the fact situation or in law, which requires the earlier view to be interfered with or
where the earlier finding has become obsolete. In the said case, the Supreme Court finding that in a
previous order, by which the prayer for bail was rejected, it having been held that there was existence
of prima facie case against the respondent concluded that there is no scope for re-agitating the said
point on the part of the respondent while contending that there is no prima facie case made out
against him.
</p><p id="p_14">10.     In the order of rejection of bail passed by this Court earlier, in the case of the petitioner,
though not specifically stated, this Court found that a prima facie case exists against the petitioner,
and, therefore, in this application, it cannot be contended that there is no prima facie case made out
against the petitioner.
</p><p id="p_15">11.     Hence, this Court finds that none of the grounds canvassed by Mr. Patnaik in support of the
prayer for grant of bail can be considered to be either changed circumstances or such, that it requires
the earlier view of this Court to be interfered with. Except the fact that the petitioner was released on
interim bail twice in the interregnum, this Court does not find any changed circumstance inasmuch as
releasing the petitioner on interim bail cannot be a consideration for granting bail to the petitioner.
</p><p id="p_16"> 12.      In view of the above findings, this Court is not inclined to grant the prayer for bail to the
petitioner, which is accordingly rejected.
</p><p id="p_17">13.    The BLAPL is accordingly dismissed.
</p><p id="p_18">                                                  Application dismissed.
