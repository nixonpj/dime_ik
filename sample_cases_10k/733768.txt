<div class="doc_title">Smt. Seema Kumari vs The State Of Bihar &amp;Amp; Ors on 24 November, 2010</div><pre id="pre_1">             IN THE HIGH COURT OF JUDICATURE AT PATNA
                        C. REV. No.131 of 2008
                        SMT. SEEMA KUMARI .
                                Versus
                     THE STATE OF BIHAR &amp; ORS .
                               -----------
</pre><p id="p_1">06.   24.11.2010            Heard learned counsel for the petitioner, for

                    the State and private respondent no.7 who has filed

                    counter affidavit.
</p>
<p id="p_2">                              This Civil Review application has been

                    preferred against the order dated 7.11.2007 in

                    C.W.J.C. No. 846 of 2006. I.A. No. 3370 of 2008 has

                    been filed for condoning the delay in filing of the

                    Review     Application.    Having        considered     the

                    submissions on behalf of the parties, the Court

                    satisfied that in the interest of justice the delay is fit

                    to be condoned. I.A. No. 3370 of 2008 stands allowed.

</p><p id="p_3">                              C.W.J.C. No. 846 of 2006 was filed by the

                    present   respondent      no.7.    The    petitioner    was

                    respondent    no.7   in   that    writ   application.   The

                    controversy was with regard to appointment on the

                    post of Anganwari Sewika . This Court held that the

                    petitioner therein (presently respondent no.7) had

                    never been appointed. This Court did not uphold her

                    claims for reasons discussed in the order. She is

                    stated to have then questioned the dismissal of the

                    writ petition with regard to her in L.P.A. No. 1042 of

                    2007 which was also dismissed on 26.8.2008 and her

                    S.L.P. against the same was also dismissed by the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                   2</span>




Supreme Court on 15.2.2010 in S.L.P. (Civil) No.

36998 of 2008.
</p>
<p id="p_4">          In the writ petition with regard to the

present petitioner, this Court observed that she

appeared to have been selected only, no formal letter

of appointment had been issued in her favour and

therefore she was in the same boat as the petitioner of

that writ application. The counter affidavit alleged

irregularities in her appointment. An observation was

therefore made that the Court found it difficult to

sustain the claim of private respondent no.7.

</p><p id="p_5">          In the Review Application, it is submitted

that the appointment letter of the petitioner in

accordance with established procedure was already

on record in C.W.J.C. No. 846 of 2006 as Annexure-

11 to the writ petition. The order of the Court in

C.W.J.C. No. 846 of 2006 therefore suffered from

error of record insofar as the present petitioner is

concerned.
</p>
<p id="p_6">          It was also asserted that she was still

continuing in service. This Court on 13.5.2010

therefore ordered maintenance of status quo in the

present proceedings.
</p>
<p id="p_7">          A counter affidavit has been filed on behalf

of State in the Review Application.
</p>
<p id="p_8">          Paragraph-4(II) unequivocally states that
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                          3</span>




       the petitioner is still working on the post. Paragraph-

       16 of the counter affidavit explicitly states that the

       petitioner belonged to the beneficiary area, where no

       applicant was available from O.B.C. or B.C. category

       and therefore her selection was made. Paragraph-17

       asserts that there was no procedural defect in the

       selection of the petitioner. Paragraph-18 reiterates

       that the State Officials had not committed any

       illegality or irregularity in the selection of the

       petitioner. It is unfortunate that the respondents

       State Officials had taken a divergent stand against

       the petitioner in C.W.J.C. No. 846 of 2006. It is

       expected that they shall be more careful in future.

</p><p id="p_9">                 In   view    of   the   stand   of   the   official

       respondents and the error on record in the order of

       this   Court    noticed     hereinabove,       the   Review

       Application has to be allowed. The order dated

       7.11.2007 in C.W.J.C. No. 846 of 2006 insofar as the

       petitioner be concerned is therefore recalled and the

       observations made therein with regard to the present

       petitioner are likewise recalled.
</p>
<p id="p_10">                 The Review Application stands allowed.
