ORAL
JUDGMENT</pre> 

 

 


 
	  

<p id="p_1">Heard
	learned counsel for the parties.
</p>	 


	  

<p id="p_2">This
	petition is directed against the order of detention dated 21.01.2012
	passed by the respondent No.2 in
	exercise of powers conferred under Section 3(2) of the Gujarat
	Prevention of Anti Social Activities Act, 1985 (for short "the
	Act") by detaining the detenue as a "dangerous person"
	as defined under Section 2(c) of the Act.
</p>	 


	  

<p id="p_3">Learned
	counsel for the detenue submits that the order of detention impugned
	in this petition deserves to be quashed and set aside and the ground
	that the registration of an offence by itself cannot bring the case
	of the detenue within the purview of definition "dangerous
	person" under Section 2(c) of the Act.  Learned counsel for
	the detenue further submits that the illegal activity carried out as
	alleged cannot have any nexus or bearing with the maintenance of the
	public order and at the most it can be said to be breach of law and
	order.  Further, except statements of witnesses and  registration of
	FIRs,  no other relevant or cogent material is available on record
	connecting the alleged anti-social activities of the detenue with
	breach of the public order.
</p>	 


	  

<p id="p_4">Learned
	counsel for the detenue, placing reliance on the decisions reported
	in the cases of (i) <a href="/doc/851946/" id="a_1">Ranubhai Bhikhabhai Bharwad (Vekaria) v.
	State of Gujarat</a> reported in 2000(3) GLR 2696; (ii) Ashokbhai
	Jivraj @Jivabhai Solanki v. Police Commisioenr, Surat reported in
	2000(1) GLH 393; and (iii) <a href="/doc/341889/" id="a_2">Mustakmiya Jabbarmiya Shaikh v.
	M.M.Mehta</a>, reported in (1995)3 SCC 237, submitted that the case
	on hand is squarely covered by the ratio laid down in the aforesaid
	decisions. Learned counsel for the detenue further submits that it
	is not possible to hold in the facts of the present case that the
	activities of the detenue with reference to the criminal case/s had
	affected even tempo of the society, posing a threat to the very
	existence of the normal and routine life of the people at large or
	that on the basis of the  criminal case/s, the detenue had put the
	entire social apparatus in disorder, making it difficult for whole
	system to exist as a system governed by the rule of law by
	disturbing the public order.  
</p>	
	 


	  

<p id="p_5">Mr.
</p><p id="p_6">	Mihir Bhatt, learned AGP for the respondent-State supported the
	detention order passed by the authority and submitted that the
	detenue is a dangerous person and sufficient material and evidence
	was found during the course of investigation, which was also
	supplied to the detenue, indicating that the detenue is in habit of
	indulging into activities as defined under Section 2(c) of the Act
	and considering the facts of the case, the detaining authority has
	rightly passed the order of detention and the detention order
	deserves to be upheld by this Court. 
</p>	
	 


	  

<p id="p_7">Having
	heard learned counsel for the parties and considering the facts and
	circumstances of the case, it appears that the subjective
	satisfaction arrived at by the detaining authority cannot be said to
	be legal, valid and in accordance with law inasmuch as the offences
	alleged in the FIR/s cannot have any bearing on the public order
	since the law of the land i.e.<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_3"> Indian Penal Code</a> and other relevant
	penal laws are sufficient enough to take care of the situation and
	that the allegations as have been levelled against the detenue
	cannot be said to be germane for the purpose of bringing the detenue
	as a dangerous person within the meaning of Section 2(c) of the Act
	and, unless and until the material is there to make out a case that
	the person concerned has become a threat and a menace to the society
	so as to disturb the whole tempo of the society and that the whole
	social apparatus is in peril disturbing public order at the instance
	of such person, it cannot be said that the detenue is a dangerous
	person within the meaning of Section 2(c) of the Act.  Except
	general statement, there is no material on record which shows that
	the detenue is acting in such a manner which is dangerous to the
	public order.   In view of the ratio laid down by the Hon'ble
	Supreme Court in the cases of (i) Ranubhai Bhikhabhai Bharwad
	(Vekaria)(supra); (ii) Ashokbhai Jivraj @Jivabhai Solanki (supra);
	and (iii) Mustakmiya Jabbarmiya
	Shaikh (supra), the Court is of the opinion that the
	activities of the detenue cannot be said to be dangerous to the
	maintenance of public order and at the most fall under the
	maintenance of "law and order".
</p>	 

 
	
	  

<p id="p_8">In
	view of the above, I am inclined to allow this petition because
	simplicitor registration of FIR/s by itself cannot have any nexus
	with the breach of maintenance of public order and the authority can
	take recourse under<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_4"> the Indian Penal Code</a> and no other relevant or
	cogent material exists for invoking powers under Section  3(2) of
	the Act.
</p>	 


	  

<p id="p_9">In
	the result, this Special Civil Application is allowed. The impugned
	order dated 21.01.2012 of detention  passed by respondent No.2 is
	hereby quashed and set aside.  The detenue is ordered to be set at
	liberty forthwith if not required in any other case.  Rule is made
	absolute accordingly. Direct service is permitted.
</p>
