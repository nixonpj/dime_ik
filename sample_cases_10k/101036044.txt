</pre><p id="p_1">                     DATED : July 3, 2019.
</p>

<p id="p_2">                                    In this application, notice was issued on
                     11.06.2019. The learned APP has handed over copy of
                     reply, which is taken on record.
</p><p id="p_3">                     2.             In the present case, an FIR dated 05.03.2019
                     was registered on a complaint lodged by a minor girl,
                     claiming that between 01.07.2018 and January, 2019,
                     the accused persons had indulged in sexual intercourse
                     with her. On this basis, offences against four accused
                     persons       were registered under                   <a href="/doc/1677485/" id="a_1">Sections        376(2)(n)</a>,
                     <a href="/doc/1677485/" id="a_2">376(2)(i)</a>, <a href="/doc/9545/" id="a_3">376-D</a>           and <a href="/doc/1836974/" id="a_4">377</a> of the IPC and <a href="/doc/230360/" id="a_5">Sections 4</a>,<a href="/doc/84602/" id="a_6">5</a>
                     and <a href="/doc/1832444/" id="a_7">6</a> of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences
                     Act, 2012. It is the case of the applicant that he is not
                     even named in the FIR. Later the complainant has given
                     a statement that the person named as accused no.4 i.e.
                     Ajay is in fact the applicant herein.
</p><p id="p_4">                     3.             It is contended on behalf of the applicant that
                     FIR     was      registered         on     05.03.2019           and      it    was
                     considerably delayed because even according to the
                     complainant,           the     incident       had      occurred         between



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">           ::: Uploaded on - 03/07/2019                                  ::: Downloaded on - 04/07/2019 06:26:16 :::</span>
                                    2                                  BA471-19.odt

         01.07.2018 and January 2019. It was also pointed out
         that after investigation was complete and the charge-
         sheet was filed on 13.04.2019, no material was brought
         on record either in the form of test identification parade
         or otherwise to even prima facie show that accused Ajay
         was none other than the applicant herein.
</p><p id="p_5">         4.             The learned counsel for the applicant also
         invited attention of this Court to the statement given by
         the complainant herself before the Police.                        In the
         detailed statement, it is repeatedly stated by the
         complainant that she had voluntary sexual intercourse
         with all the four accused persons.
</p><p id="p_6">         5.             Although    the    learned     APP      has      strongly
         opposed          grant of relief in the present application,
         pointing out that the victim i.e. complainant is a minor,
         who was about 15 years old when the incidents
         occurred, looking to the material on record, particularly
         the statement of the complainant herself and absence
         of material, at this stage, to show that the said accused
         Ajay was indeed the applicant Umesh himself, this Court
         is of the opinion that the present application deserves to
         be allowed.
</p><p id="p_7">         6.             Hence the present application is allowed and
         the applicant is directed to be released on bail on the
         following conditions:-
</p><p id="p_8">         (a)            The    applicant   shall    furnish      PR     bond      of
         Rs.25,000/- and a surety in the like amount.
</p><p id="p_9">         (b)            The applicant shall attend the proceedings
         before the trail Court on each and every date.
</p><p id="p_10">         (c)            The    applicant    shall     not      influence        the
         witnesses.
