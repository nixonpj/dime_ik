<p id="p_1">LISA GILL, J. (oral)

             This appeal has been filed seeking enhancement of the

compensation awarded to the claimants vide award dated 04.09.2014, passed

by learned Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Jind (hereinafter referred to as

'the Tribunal).
</p>
<p id="p_2">             Claimants-appellants are the parents of Sachin (deceased) who

died in a motor vehicle accident, which took place on 05.06.2013, due to the

rash and negligent driving of the offending truck Ashoka Leyland bearing

registration No. HR-64-7155, by its driver Surinder Singh-respondent no.1.

             Learned Tribunal while observing that Sachin (deceased) was a

student of 11th standard and unmarried, would be able to secure a job of at

least a semi-skilled person, assessed his income at Rs.6,000/- per month.

Deceased was about 16 years old at the time of the accident. After effecting a

deduction of 50%, multiplier of 15 was applied. Learned Tribunal awarded a

total sum of Rs.5,75,000/- as compensation, after including a sum of

Rs.5,000/- towards loss of estate and Rs.25,000/- towards last rites.

</p><p id="p_4">             Present appeal has been filed seeking enhancement of the

aforesaid compensation.
</p>
<p id="p_5">               Learned counsel for the appellants submits that the deceased

apart from carrying on with his studies was also engaged in agricultural and

dairy farming on a part time basis. Future prospects should be awarded and

compensation under the conventional heads should also be enhanced. It is,

thus, prayed that compensation may be enhanced.

</p><p id="p_6">             Learned counsel for respondent no.3-insurance company,

however, submits that as there is no evidence of deceased being employed or

being engaged in any kind of work generating income, therefore, increment

on account of future prospects should not be afforded. It is submitted that the

impugned award dated 04.09.2014 does not call for any enhancement of the

compensation as the same is reasonable and just in the facts and

circumstances of the case. Dismissal of the appeal is prayed for.

</p><p id="p_7">             I have heard learned counsel for the parties and have gone

through the record.

            There is no dispute regarding death of Sachin in the motor

vehicle accident, which took place on 05.06.2013, due to the rash and

negligent driving of the offending truck bearing registration No. HR-64-

7155 by its driver Surinder Singh-respondent no.1. Finding of the learned

Tribunal on this issue has attained finality. Admittedly, the deceased was

aged about 16 years at the time of the accident and a student of 11th

standard. Certificate of secondary examination of Sachin (deceased) is on

record as Ex.P-2. Learned Tribunal has thus rightly assessed his income as

Rs.6,000/- per month. It is to be noticed that minimum wages of a skilled

labourer at the time of the accident in the State of Haryana as on 01.07.2013

was Rs.5,991/- per month. Therefore, income of the deceased is upheld to be

Rs.6,000/- per month.
</p>
<p id="p_10">            I do not find any merit in the argument raised by learned

counsel for the insurance company that increment on account of future

prospects should not be afforded in this case. Admittedly, the deceased was

a student of Class 11. It is further averred that he was engaged in

agricultural and dairy farming though there is no specific documentary

evidence in this respect. Needless to say, after securing his education, the

deceased would necessarily have been able to earn the minimum wages as

afforded to a skilled labourer in the State at that point of time. In the facts

and circumstances of the case, the increment on account of future prospects

@ 40% is awarded. Deduction of 50% was correctly effected by learned

Tribunal. Multiplier of 15 has been wrongly applied by the learned Tribunal.

It has been held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Munna Lal Jain Vs.




                                 3 of 5

Vipin Kumar Sharma, (2015) 6 SCC 347, that multiplier has to be applied

with reference to the age of the deceased and not the parents. Therefore,

multiplier of 18 has to be applied. Claimants are entitled to a sum of

Rs.15,000/- each on account of loss of estate and funeral expenses instead of

Rs.5,000/- and Rs.25,000/- respectively as awarded by the learned Tribunal.

In terms of the judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/175246407/" id="a_1">Magma General

Insurance Company Ltd. v. Nanu Ram Alias Chuhru Ram &amp; Ors</a>. 2018(4)

RCR Civil 333, the claimants are entitled to Rs.40,000/- on account of loss

of filial consortium.
</p>
<p id="p_11">               Appellants-claimants are, thus, entitled to compensation which

is re-worked as under:-

</pre><p id="p_12">          2.     Total income after addition at   36,000+14,400 ( 36,000 x

                 future prospects                 = 50,400/-
</p><p id="p_13">          3.     Total dependency after           50400 x 18 = 9,07,200/-

</pre><p id="p_16">               Needless to say, the amount already awarded by the learned

Tribunal shall stand deducted from the compensation as detailed above.

Claimants shall be entitled to interest on the enhanced amount at the rate of

7.5% per annum from the date of filing of the petition till realization.

            It is clarified that claimants-appellants are not entitled to any

interest for the period of delay (406 days) in filing of this appeal as delay

was condoned with a stipulation that the appellants shall not be entitled to

interest for the period of delay, in case of any enhancement of the

compensation awarded to them.
