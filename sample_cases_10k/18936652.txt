    appellant.
</p>
<p id="p_7">               The plaintiff is the appellant in this appeal against the

    judgment and decree of affirmance dismissing the suit. The plaintiff

    filed the suit for declaration of his title over the suit land on the

    basis of settlement taken by his father from the Ex-landlord and also

    on the basis of adverse possession. The case of the plaintiff in short

    was that his father Chholo Pandit took the settlement of the suit land
 Patna High Court SA No.133 of 2014 dt.05-10-2016                                 2




         from the Ex-landlord in the year 1945-46 and since thereafter his

         father and after his death the plaintiff had been coming in possession

         over the same. It was also the case of the plaintiff that subsequently

         the father of the plaintiff also constructed a thatched house on the

         suit land and also planted trees therein. It has, however, been

         accepted by the plaintiff that the return was not submitted by the Ex-

         landlord in the name of the plaintiff or his father for the suit land. It

         was the case of the plaintiff that during the municipal survey the suit

         land was wrongly recorded in the name of the Defendant No. 1 and

         after threat of dispossession by Defendant No. 1 the suit has been

         filed. The defendants contested the claim of the plaintiff denying the

         case of settlement as pleaded or possession of the plaintiff over the

         suit land. The defendants alleged that the plaintiff had put a thatched

         hut over the vacant portion of the suit land during the encroachment

         drive by the local administration of the State of Bihar in the month

         of February/March 2001 and thereafter he has filed the suit with

         dishonest motive. The defendants claimed their exclusive title and

         possession over the suit land.
</p>
<p id="p_8">                      Both the courts below have concurrently come to the

         finding that the plaintiff has failed to establish the claim of

         settlement of the suit land with his father. Both the courts below

         have further found that the defendants have got valid title over the
 Patna High Court SA No.133 of 2014 dt.05-10-2016                                3




         suit property and the plaintiff was only a trespasser over the suit

         land. The suit was dismissed and thereafter the appeal has also been

         dismissed by the impugned judgment and decree.

</p><p id="p_9">                      Learned counsel for the appellant has submitted that both

         the courts below misconstrued the evidence on record and the

         findings are therefore, vitiated. The learned counsel during the

         course of submission has accepted that the plaintiff has put forward

         the claim of possession over the suit land on the basis of title and the

         claim on the basis of adverse possession also. No other submission

         has been made on behalf of the appellant.
</p>
<p id="p_10">                      After considering the submissions and perusal of judgment

         of both the courts below, it is transparent that both the courts below

         have elaborately considered the evidence on record and thereafter

         have reached to the conclusion that the plaintiff has failed to

         establish his title over the suit land on the basis of settlement as

         pleaded. The appellate court below has also rightly come to the

         conclusion that the claim of adverse possession cannot go together

         with the claim of title over the suit property unless the later is

         renounced. It has also been found on the basis of scrutiny of

         evidence that the plaintiff came in possession of the suit land during

         the encroachment in the year 2001. The findings of both the courts

         below have been recorded on the basis of evidence which were
          Patna High Court SA No.133 of 2014 dt.05-10-2016                                4




                  acceptable and could have been relied upon.
</p>
<p id="p_11">                               This court has not been persuaded to find any perversity or

                  unreasonableness in those findings. In fact the entire submission on

                  behalf of the appellant has centered around reappreciation of

                  evidence in order to overturn the concurrent findings of fact which

                  cannot be done at the second appellate stage.

</p><p id="p_12">                                   This Court, therefore, does not find any substantial

                  question of law arising for consideration in this appeal, which is

                  accordingly, dismissed.
