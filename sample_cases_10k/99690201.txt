                    and negligent driving of vehicle bearing no. DL­
                   1PD­1060 i.e. by respondent no.1? OPP.

                   compensation? if so, to what amount and from
                   whom? OPP.
</p>

<p id="p_9">                   3)   Relief.
</p><p id="p_10">8.     In order to establish their claim, petitioner who is wife of deceased
examined herself as PW1 and Sh. Raja @ Aman Ali who was an eye
witness to the incident was examined as PW2 . No witness was examined in
defence by respondents.
</p><p id="p_11">9.     Both the sides were directed to submit their respective written
submissions in Form VI­A which have been submitted on behalf of
petitioners. On behalf of respondents, written submissions in form VI­A
have not been filed on record till date. Having heard the arguments
advanced by Ld. Counsel for the parties and having gone through the
record, Issue wise findings are as under.
</p>

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">ISSUE NO. 1</span>
<p id="p_12">10.    PW2 Raja @ Aman Ali is an eye witness to the accident. On
06.07.2018 i.e. the date of incident, he was driving his e­rickshaw and the
deceased was riding the motorcycle. When PW2 and deceased reached near
5th Pusta, offending vehicle being driven in rash and negligent manner hit
the motorcycle of deceased. Due to the same, deceased fell down on the

DAR No. : 261/18                                                      4/14
 road and received injuries. Having seen this, driver of offending vehicle
tried to run away from the spot but with the assistance of crowd, he was
caught hold at the spot. Police reached at the spot and deceased was
removed to GTB Hospital . It was submitted by Ld. Counsel for insurance
company that the alleged eye witness had not reported the matter to the
police. His testimony is suggestive of his being interested witness only in
order to help the case of petitioner who was not the summoned witness.
</p><p id="p_13">11.    In cross examination, PW2 had admitted knowing deceased for last
two years. According to him, police had not recorded his statement at the
spot and his statement was recorded at PS Seelampur. He did not remember
the date of recording of his statement but it was at about 10 am. PW2
though did not remember the complete registration of number but reiterated
the last digits of offending vehicle as 1060 and denied the suggestion that he
being known to the deceased , in order to help the petitioner, has deposed
falsely. Nevertheless, FIR bearing no. 520/2018, u/s 279/337 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_2">IPC</a> was
registered at P.S.New Usmanpur against respondent no.1. After conclusion
of investigation police charge sheeted respondent no.1 to face trial for
offences punishable U/s 279/304­A <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_3">IPC</a> in State case arising out of
abovesaid FIR and the documents filed therewith, carry presumption of
their correctness in terms of Rule 7 of Delhi Motor Accident Claim
Tribunal Rules, 2008. It was for the respondents especially respondent
no.1/driver to rebut the presumption contained in Rule 7 of Delhi Motor
Accident Claim Tribunal Rules by leading evidence to the contrary. No


DAR No. : 261/18                                                     5/14
 witness was examined by any of the respondents to prove their defence.
Reliance is placed upon United India Insurance Company Ltd. Vs.
Deepak Goel &amp; Ors., 2014 (2), T.A.C. 846 (Del.), wherein it was observed
that " in a case, where FIR is lodged, chargesheet is filed, then the
documents mentioned above are sufficient to establish the fact that the
driver of the vehicle in question was negligent in causing the accident
particularly when there was no defence available from his side".
</p><p id="p_14">12.    Petitioners have been able to prove on the basis of preponderance of
probabilities that the deceased had died due to injuries suffered by him
caused by rash and negligent act of respondent no.1 in driving the offending
vehicle bearing no. DL­1PD­1060 which was owned by respondent no.2
and was insured with respondent no.3. Thus, issue no. 1 is decided in favour
of the petitioner and against the respondents.
</p>

<p id="p_15">ISSUE NO. 2 :
</p><p id="p_16">13.    Though no amount of compensation can restore, eliminate or
ameliorate the loss suffered on account of death, yet pecuniary damages are
meant to take care of the prospective pecuniary loss of future income and
the non pecuniary damages to compensate, to an extent, for pain and
suffering, loss of love, companionship, expectation of life etc. As was noted
in Sarla Verma Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation 2009 (6) SCC 121, just
compensation is pecuniary compensation which is fair and equitable, on the
facts and circumstances of the case, to make good the loss suffered as a


DAR No. : 261/18                                                    6/14
 result of the wrong, as far as money can do so, by applying the well settled
principles relating to award of compensation. It is not intended to be a
bonanza, largesse or source of profit but at the same time cannot be the
pittience.
</p>

<p id="p_17">                    LOSS OF DEPENDENCY
</p><p id="p_18">14.     Deceased, as stated, was aged 48 years as on the date of accident as
mentioned in Aadhar Card. In terms of driving license of deceased on
record, he was 52 years of age as on the date of accident. Copy of Life
Insurance policy is also placed on record according to which he was 44
years of age in year 2010. In these circumstances, the age of deceased is
taken as 52 years as on the date of accident.
</p><p id="p_19">15.    Deceased as stated was running his own business and was earning Rs.
25000/­ per month by running a small manufacturing unit. He was 8th class
passed. Though in statement recorded as per clause 29 of MCTAP,
petitioner stated that deceased was earning Rs. 15000/­ per month.
However, no material was brought on record to substantiate the plea with
regard to profession, qualification and earnings of deceased either for
15000/­ or Rs. 25000/­. PW1 admitted that she did not have any
documentary proof regarding occupation and income of deceased or his
earnings at Rs. 25000/­ per month. In the absence of sufficient material
with regard to monthly income of deceased and his educational
qualifications, his monthly income is assessed as that of an unskilled worker


DAR No. : 261/18                                                    7/14
 under <a href="/doc/142278/" id="a_4">Minimum Wages Act</a> applicable during the relevant period as also
claimed by petitioners in form VI­A. The minimum wages of an unskilled
worker was Rs. 13896/­ per month at the time of accident in question.
</p><p id="p_20">16.    Claimant is wife of deceased, having two sons and three daughters
who all are major. In statement recorded under clause 29 of petitioner, she
reiterated that her two daughters and one son are married. Her younger son
is 19 years of age and she has one unmarried daughter who is 21 years of
age. In these circumstances, the only other dependency seems to be that of
the unmarried, unemployed 21 years old daughter. Considering the fact that
there were two dependents at the time of accident, deduction of 1/3rd from
the income of the deceased towards his personal and living expenses is
required to be made as per the criteria laid down in National Insurance
Company Limited Vs Pranay Sethi &amp; Ors.
</p><p id="p_21">17.     In the cases where the deceased is self­employed or on a fixed
salary, addition of 40% of the established income is the warrant where the
deceased was below the age of 40 years, as was noted in National Insurance
Company Limited Vs Pranay Sethi &amp; Ors. Accordingly, addition of 40% is
made towards future prospects in the monthly income of deceased.
Considering that deceased was 52 years of age as on the date of accident,
the multiplier applicable shall be 11. The total loss of dependency
accordingly works out to (Rs. 13896+ 40% of 13896 x 2/3 x 12 x 11 )= Rs.
16,94,867.328, rounded off to Rs. 16,94,900/­.

<pre id="pre_2">DAR No. : 261/18                                                  8/14
                         LOSS OF CONSORTIUM
</pre><p id="p_22">18.    Petitioners have claimed compensation for loss of consortium at Rs.
40,000/­ each in the written submissions filed in form VI­A. In Magna Vs.
General Insurance Co. Ltd Vs. Nanu Ram &amp; Ors. 2018 ACJ 2782, it was
noted that " 'consortium' is a compendious term, which encompasses
'spousal consortium', 'parental consortium' and 'filial consortium'. The right
to consortium wold include the company, care, help, comfort, guidance,
solace and affection of the deceased, which is a loss to his family. Spousal
Consortium allows compensation to surviving spouse for loss of 'company,
society, cooperation, affection and aid of the other in every conjugal
relation'. Parental consortium is granted to the child upon the premature
death of a parent, for loss of 'parent aid' , protection affection, society,
discipline, guidance and training'.
</p><p id="p_23">19.    Accordingly, sum of Rs. 40,000/­ each is awarded to petitioner no.1
Zamila and unmarried daughter of deceased namely Gulabsha in the instant
matter towards loss of spousal and parental consortium respectively.

Zamila and Gulafsa the petitioners for loss of love and affection as per the
law laid down in "Magna Vs. General Insurance Co. Ltd Vs. Nanu Ram
&amp; Ors", mentioned supra.

issued valid insurance policy of offending vehicle. Copy of driving license
of respondent no.1 has been filed on record. No evidence to the contrary
was brought on record by the insurance company with regard to license
being invalid or the driver being incompetent to drive the vehicle. Hence,
