  PW1/8. He has also proved his matriculate certificate; graduation certificate and MBA
  certificate respectively as Ex.PW1/9 to PW1/11. The cross-examination carried on by
  the respondent No.3 is not suggestive of anything which may discard the claim of the
  petitioner nor the driver of the offending vehicle was not rash and negligent at the time
  of accident.
</p><p id="p_18">  12.             In the present case, the police have filed the Detailed Accident Report
  (DAR) on record pertaining to FIR No. 94/13; P. S. Vikas Puri u/s 279/338 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_4">IPC</a>.
</p><p id="p_19">  13.         On the aspect of negligence, I am being guided by the judgment of
  Hon'ble High Court of Delhi in 2009 ACJ 287, National Insurance Company Limited
  Vs. Pushpa Rana wherein in the Hon'ble High Court held that in case the petitioner
  files the certified copy of the criminal record or the criminal record showing the
  completion of the investigation by the police or the issuance of charge sheet under
  <a href="/doc/1270101/" id="a_5">section 279</a>/<a href="/doc/409589/" id="a_6">304</a> A IPC or the certified copy of the FIR or in addition the recovery
  memo on the mechanical inspection report of the offending vehicle,                   these
  documents are sufficient proof to reach to the conclusion that the driver was
  negligent. It was further held that the proceedings under the <a href="/doc/785258/" id="a_7">Motor Vehicles Act</a> are
  not akin to the proceedings in a civil suit and hence strict rules of evidence are not
  required to be followed in this regard. Further, in Kaushnumma Begum and others
  v/s New India Assurance Company Limited, 2001 ACJ 421 SC the issue of wrongful
  act or omission on the part of driver of the motor vehicle involved in the accident has
  been left to a secondary importance and mere use or involvement of motor vehicle
  in causing bodily injuries or death to a human being or damage to property would

Suit No. 314/13                                                                 Page No. 5/18

  settled law that the term rashness and negligence has to be construed lightly while
  making a decision on a petition for claim for the same as compared to the word
  rashness and negligence as             finds mention in<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_10"> the Indian Penal Code</a>. This is
  because the chapter          in the <a href="/doc/785258/" id="a_11">Motor Vehicle Act</a> dealing with            compensation is a
  benevolent legislation and not a penal one.

  titled as United India Insurance Co. Ltd. Vd. Smt. Rinki @ Rinku &amp; Ors decided on
  23/07/2012 has held as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">                    "The Claims Tribunal was conscious of the fact that negligence is

                    Vehicles Act, 1988(the Act). It is also true that the proceedings for
                    grant of compensation under the Act are neither governed by the
                    criminal procedures nor are a civil suit. A reference may be made

                          rightly taken a holistic view of the matter. It was
                          necessary to be borne in mind that strict proof of
                          any accident caused by a particular bus in a
                          particular manner may not be possible to be done

Suit No. 314/13                                                               Page No. 9/18
   Supreme Court in Raj Kumar Vs. Ajay Kumar &amp; Ors, reported as 2011 ACJ I in
  which it was held as under:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_12">                  "Where the claimant suffers a permanent disability as a result of injuries,
                  the assessment of compensation under the head of loss of future
                  earnings, would depend upon the effect and impact of such permanent
                  disability on his earning capacity. The Tribunal should not mechanically
                  apply the percentage of permanent disability as the percentage of
                  economic loss or loss of earning capacity. In most of the cases, the
                  percentage of economic loss,that is, percentage of loss of earning
                  capacity, arising from a permanent disability will be different from the
                  percentage of permanent disability. Some Tribunals wrongly assume
                  that in all cases, a particular extent ( percentage ) of permanent
                  disability would result in a corresponding loss of earning capacity, and
                  consequently, if the evidence produced show 45% as the permanent
                  disability, will hold that there is 45% loss of future earning capacity. In
                  most of the cases, equating the extent ( percentage) of loss of earning
                  capacity to the extent percentage of permanent disability will result in
                  award of either too low or too high a compensation. What requires to be
                  assessed by the Tribunal is the effect of the permanent disability on the
                  earning capacity of the injured; and after assessing the loss of earning
                  capacity in terms of a percentage of the income, it has to be quantified
                  in terns of money, to arrive at the future loss of earnings (by applying the
                  standard multiplier method used to determine loss of dependency). We
                  may however note that in some cases, on appreciation of evidence and
                  assessment , the Tribunal may find that percentage of loss of earning
                  capacity as a result of the permanent disability, is approximately the
                  same as the percentage of permanent disability in which case, of
                  course, the Tribunal will adopt the said percentage for determination of
                  compensation(See for example, the decisions of this court in Arvind

</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_14">                  "14. We find it extremely difficult to fathom any rationale for the
                  observation made in paragraph 24 of the judgment in Sarla Verma's case
                  that where the deceased was self-employed or was on a fixed salary
                  without provision for annual increment, etc., the Courts will usually take
                  only the actual income at the time of death a departure from this rule
                  should be made only in rare and exceptional cases involving special
                  circumstance. In our view, it will be nave to say that the wages or total
                  emoluments/income of a person who is self-employed or who is
                  employed on a fixed salary without provision for annual increment, etc.,
                  would remain the same throughout his life. The rise in the cost of living
                  affects everyone across the board. It does not make any distinction
                  between rich and poor. As a matter of fact, the effect of rise in prices
                  which directly impacts the cost of living is minimal on the rich and
                  maximum on those who are self-employed or who get fixed
                  income/emoluments. They are the worst affected people. Therefore,
                  they put extra efforts to generate additional income necessary for
                  sustaining their families. The salaries of those employed employed
                  under      the   Central    and     State   Governments       and     their
                  agencies/instrumentalities have been revised from time to time to provide
                  a cushion against the rising prices and provisions have been made for
                  providing security to the families of the deceased employees. The
                  salaries of those employed in private sectors have also increased
                  manifold. Till about two decades ago, nobody could have imagined that
                  salary of Class IV employee of the Government would be in five figures
                  and total emoluments of those in higher echelons of service will cross the
                  figure of rupees one lac. Although, the wages/income of those employed


Suit No. 314/13                                                                             Page No. 11/18
                   in unorganized sectors has not registered a corresponding increase and
                  has not kept pace with the increase in the salaries of the Government
                  employees and those employed in private sectors but it cannot be denied
                  that there has been incremental enhancement in the income of those
                  who are self-employed and even those engaged on daily basis, monthly
                  basis or even seasonal basis. We can take judicial notice of this fact that
                  with a view to meet the challenges posed by high cost of living, the
                  persons falling on the latter category periodically increase the cost of
                  their labour. In this context, it may be useful to give an example of a
                  tailor who earns his livelihood by stitching cloths. If the cost of living
                  increases and the prices of essentials go up, it is but natural for him to
                  increase the cost of his labour. So will be the cases of ordinary skilled
                  and unskilled labour, like barber, blacksmith, cobbler, mason etc.
                  Therefore, we do not think that while making the observations in the last
                  three lines of paragraph 24 of Sarla Verma's judgment, the Court had
                  intended to lay down an absolute rule that there will be no addition in the
                  income of a person who is self-employed or who is paid fixed wages.
                  Rather, it would be reasonable to say that a person who is self-employed
                  or is engaged on fixed wages will also get 30 per cent increase in his
                  total income over a period of time and if he/she becomes victim of
                  accident then the same formula deserved to be applied for calculating the
                  amount of compensation".</blockquote>


<p id="p_37">              However,in a recent case decided by Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in

  Judges bench held that
</p><p id="p_38">              11.       Since, the court in Santosh Devi's case (Supra) actually intended
              to follow the principle in the case of salaried persons as laid in Sarla
              Verma's case (Supra) and to make it applicable also to self-employed and
              persons on fixed wages, it is clarified that the increase in the case of those
              groups is not 30 % always; it will also have a reference to the age. In other
              words, in the case of self-employed or persons with fixed wages, in case,
              the deceased victim was below 40 years, there must be an addition of 50
              % to the actual income of the deceased while computing future prospects.
              Needless to say that the actual income should be income after paying the
              tax, if any. Addition should be 30 % in case the deceased was in age group
              of 40 to 50 years.
</p><p id="p_39">              12.       In Sarla Verma's case (supra), it has been stated that in the case
              of those above 50 years, there shall be no addition. Having regard to the
              fact that in the case of those self-employed or on the fixed wages, where
              there is normally no age of superannuation, we are of the view that it will
              only be just and equitable to provide an addition of 15 % in the case where
              the victim is between the age group of 50 to 60 years so as to make the
              compensation just, equitable, fair and reasonable. There shall normally be
              no addition thereafter.

</p><p id="p_41">               20. The ratio of a decision of this Court, on a legal issue is a precedent.
              But an observation made by this Court, mainly to achieve uniformity and
              consistency on a socio-economic issue, as contrasted from a legal
              principle, though a precedent, can be, and in fact ought to be periodically
              revisited, as observed in Santosh Devi (Supra). We may therefore, revisit
              the practice of awarding compensation under conventional heads: loss of
              consortium to the spouse, loss of love, care and guidance to children and
              funeral expenses. It may be noted that the sum of Rs. 25,00/- to Rs.
              10,000/- in those heads was fixed several decades ago and having regard
              to inflation factor, the same needs to be increased. In Sarla Verma's case
              (supra), it was held that compensation for loss of consortium should be in
              the range of Rs. 5,000/- to Rs.10,000/-. In legal parlance, 'consortium' is
              the right of the spouse to the company, care, help, comfort, guidance,
              society, solace, affection and sexual relations with his or her mate. That
              non-pecuniary head of damages has not been properly understood by our
              Courts. The loss of companionship, love, care and protection etc., the
              spouse is entitled to get, has to be compensated appropriately. The
              concept of non-pecuniary damage for loss of consortium is one of the
              major heads of award of compensation in other parts of the world more
              particularly in the United States of America, Australia, etc. English Courts
              have also compensation even during the period of temporary disablement.
              By loss of consortium, the courts have made an attempt to compensate the
              loss of spouse affection, comfort, solace, companionship, society,
              assistance, protection, care and sexual relations during the future years.
              Unlike the compensation awarded in other countries and other
              jurisdictions, since the legal heirs are otherwise adequately compensated
              for the pecuniary loss, it would not be proper to award a major amount
              under this head. Hence, we are of the view that it would only be just and
              reasonable that the courts award at least Rupees One Lakh for loss of
              consortium.
