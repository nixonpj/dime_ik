     This appeal is filed under <a href="/doc/93665491/" id="a_1">Section 173(1)</a> of the Motor
Vehicles Act against the Judgment and Award dated
21.08.2011 passed in MVC No.145/2009 on the file of the
MACT, Arkalgud, partly allowing the claim petition for
compensation and seeking enhancement of compensation.

      This appeal coming on for Orders this day, the Court
delivered the following:

                      JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">     Claimant in MVC No.145/2009 on the file of MACT,

Arkalgud, has come up in this appeal seeking enhancement

of compensation awarded for the death of her husband,

Ramegowda, aged about 58 years. The said appeal is filed

with inordinate delay of 406 days. Hence I.A.1/2012 is filed

seeking condonation of the same.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">2.   Heard the counsel for appellant on I.A.1/2012. Perused

the affidavit filed in support thereof. On going through the

same, it is seen that the date of Judgment is mentioned and

also compensation awarded.        Sofaras delay of 406 days is

concerned, nothing is stated except stating that she was

illiterate, she was suffering from fever and she has financial
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                3</span>


difficulty, because of the said reasons, she was not able to

contact her counsel and hence there is delay.         On going

through the Judgment impugned, it is seen that there is only

one claimant before the Tribunal, i.e., widow of deceased

Ramegowda and that she appeared before the Tribunal,

conducted the same by adducing oral and documentary

evidence and also managed to get one independent witness as

eye witness and adduced evidence in support of her case and

thereafter secured an order on merit.      In that view of the

matter, the averment that she is illiterate, not conversant

with legal proceedings does not stand to reason.


</p><p id="p_4">3.   Sofaras ailment is concerned, though it is stated that

she was suffering from fever, she does not say during which

period she was suffering from fever, when she recovered from

the said ailment, proof of such ailment and treatment taken is

also not produced. In that view of the matter, the averments

made in the affidavit is a make believable story to get over the

inordinate delay of 406 days, which is not properly explained.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                4</span>




</p><p id="p_5">4.     However, after going through the Judgment impugned,

it is seen that for the death of a mason, which has taken

place in the year 2009, awarding compensation in a sum of

Rs.2,42,000/- appears to be just and proper.    In that view of

the matter, this Court feel that even if the delay is condoned

and appeal is taken up for consideration, there is no scope for

enhancement.      Hence the application in I.A.1/2012 is

dismissed. Consequently the appeal is dismissed.
