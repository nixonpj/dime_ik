   IN THE COURT OF MS SHIVALI SHARMA:  METROPOLITAN 
    MAGISTRATE/MAHILA COURTS, WEST DISTRICT, DELHI

STATE VS. Anwar and others
FIR NO: 955/03
P. S. Uttam Nagar
U/s  498A <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_1">IPC</a>
                                                             Dated 12.10.2012


                            ORDER ON CHARGE

   1.</pre><p id="p_1"> The Present FIR has been registered against 5 accused persons. Their 

       names and relations with the complainant are as under:­

Accused no.     Name                         Relationship with complainant

Accused no. 1 Anwar                          Husband

Accused no. 2 Duryodhan Singh                Father in law

Accused no. 3 Kamla Devi                     Mother in law

Accused no. 4 Jeevan Kumari                  Jethani

Accused no. 5 Sulochana                      Nanad



</p><p id="p_2">   2. The present FIR has been registered on the basis of   a hand written 

       complaint made by complainant   Manju to DCP, South­West District, 

       Delhi on 26.5.2003.
</p>
<p id="p_3">   3. Arguments on the point of charge have been heard and record has been 

       carefully perused.
</p>
<p id="p_4">   4. Initially the charge sheet was filed against accused Anwar only while 


State Vs. Anwar and others, FIR No. 955/03                             1/9
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                             2</span>

       the   other   accused   persons   were   kept   in   colum   no.2   and   were   not 

       chargesheeted.   Vide   order   dated   18.11.2004   my   Ld.   Predecessor 

       directed for summoning of accused Anwar, Duryodhan, Kamla Devi 

       and   Jeevan   Kumari.   Accused   Sulochana   was   not   directed   to   be 

       summoned by my Ld. Predecessor. The said fact is also reflected in 

       order   sheet   dated   18.2.2005.   However,   inadvertently   summons   were 

       issued   qua   accused   Sulochana   and   she   has   been   appearing   in   the 

       present   matter.   Perusal   of   entire   complaint   shows   that   there   is   no 

       allegation against accused Sulochana neither for offence u/s 498A <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_2">IPC</a> 

       nor   for   offence   u/s   406   <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_3">IPC</a>.   Accused   Sulochana   is,   accordingly, 

       discharged in the present matter. 
</p>
<p id="p_5">   5. As regards the other 4 accused persons there are specific allegations of 

       physical as well as mental harassment caused to the complainant by 

       these accused persons. There are also allegations that the complainant 

       was harassed and treated with cruelty on account of insufficient dowry. 

       She was not given proper food and was threatened for being divorced 

       to be accused Anwar. 
</p>
<p id="p_6">   6. It has been argued by Ld. Defence Counsel that since there was no 

       incriminating   evidence   against   accused   Duryodhan   Singh,   Jeevan 

       Kumari and Kamla Devi, they were not chargesheeted by the I.O. The 

       complainant  had  been  residing  with  her  husband  accused  Anwar in 

       Delhi while other accused persons were residing in Himachal Pradesh 

       at their native village. Thus, there was no possibility of harassment of 

       the complainant by other accused persons and accordingly, they should 

State Vs. Anwar and others, FIR No. 955/03                                           2/9
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                              3</span>

       also be discharged. Moreover, no specific dates of any incident has 

       been mentioned in the entire complaint and the complaint is vague and 

       without any specific allegations. 
</p>
<p id="p_7">   7. I do not find any merit in the argument of the Ld. Defence Counsel. 

       The complainant has categorically narrated the incidents which have 

       taken place at the native village of her husband in her matrimonial 

       home and the incidents  which had taken place at Delhi. Mere non­

       mentioning of the dates in the complaint can not be a sole ground for 

       discharge of the accused persons as the explanation regarding the dates 

       of the incident can come during recording of evidence. Considering the 

       allegations made by the complainant, I am of the view, that prima facie 

       case u/s 498A <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_4">IPC</a> is made out against accused Anwar, Kamla Devi and 

       Jeevan   Kumari.   Accused   Duryodhan   has   already   expired   and 

       proceedings against him have already been abated. 

</p><p id="p_8">   8. During   the   course   of   arguments,   it   has   also   been   argued   by   Ld. 

       Counsel for the complainant that <a href="/doc/988620/" id="a_5">Section 406</a> IPC is also attracted in 

       the present matter, slthough the accused persons have not been charge 

       sheeted for the said offence as the dowry articles of the complainant 

       have   not   been   returned   to   her.   Submissions   of   Ld.   Counsel   for   the 

       complainant in this regard appears to be meritless as there is not even a 

       single allegation of entrustment of any dowry articles to any of the 

       accused persons or their misappropriation or non­returning by any of 

       them on demand of the complainant. Thus, in my opinion, no offfence 

       u/s  406 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_6">IPC</a> is  made out against any of the accused persons  in the 

State Vs. Anwar and others, FIR No. 955/03                                            3/9
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                           4</span>

        present case. 
</p>
<p id="p_9">    9. Let charge u/s 498A <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_7">IPC</a> be framed against accused Anwar, Kamla 

        Devi and Jeevan. 
</p>
<p id="p_10">    10. Accused Sulochana is discharged. However, her B/B &amp; S/B shall stand 

        extended for a period of six months u/s  437A <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_8">Cr.PC</a>.

</p><p id="p_11">    11. Accused Duryodhan has already expired and proceedings against him 

        has already abated. </p><pre id="pre_2">
