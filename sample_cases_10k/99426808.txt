                     CLMA No. 13334 of 2018

               WRIT PETITION (M/S) NO. 2675 of 2001

Life Insurance Corporation of India                            ..........Petitioner.

                                         Vs.

Additional District Judge, Dehradun &amp; others.                      ...Respondent</pre>

<p id="p_1">Sri B.C. Pandey, learned Senior Counsel assisted by Sri Siddharth Bisht, learned counsel
for the petitioner.
</p><p id="p_2">Sri B.S. Parihar, learned Standing Counsel for the State of Uttarakhand.
</p>

<p id="p_3">                                                                 Dated: 08.11. 2019
Ramesh Ranganathan, C.J.
</p>
<p id="p_4">       This Court had, by its order in CLMA No. 13334 of 2018 dated
26.07.2019, directed notice returnable in four weeks to be issued to
the respondents on the application for condonation of delay, permitted
the learned counsel for the petitioner to take out notice on the
respondents by registered post acknowledgement due, and to file
proof of service within four weeks. Notices sent by the Registry were
returned undelivered with the remark "unclaimed by addressees".
During the course of hearing on 13.09.2019, Mr. B.C. Pande, learned
Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner, requested that
the matter be taken up after two weeks to enable the petitioner to file
an application for substituted service on the respondents by paper
publication. Acceding to his request, the matter was directed to be
listed after two weeks.
</p>
<p id="p_5">2.             On the notice for publication, in Amar Ujala Hindi daily
newspaper, having been prepared by the Registry, and on its being
handed over to the counsel on 20.09.2019, service was effected, by
way of publication in Amar Ujala newspaper having wide circulation
in Dehradun city, on 22.09.2019; and a compliance affidavit was filed
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                    2</span>




on 10.10.2019. In the order dated 18.10.2019, while taking note of
the fact that service by way of publication in Amar Ujala newspaper
had been effected despite which the respondents had not entered
appearance, this Court opined that, while it may have been justified in
proceeding with the matter treating notice on the respondents as
having been served, considering the long delay of more than a decade,
in availing the present remedy of recall, it was appropriate to direct
service of notice to be effected on the respondents once again. The
District Judge, Dehradun was directed to have the notice, of the
application seeking condonation of delay, served on the respondents
through process server; and to file proof of service within three weeks.
The matter was directed to be listed on 08.11.2019.
</p>
<p id="p_6">3.           The service report dated 24.10.2019 records that notice
on the second respondent was affixed on the closed door of the subject
premises as the recipient was reported to be dead. With respect to the
third respondent, the report states that the notice was affixed on the
closed door as the recipient was not residing at the given address; and
with respect to respondents 4 and 5, the report states that the notices
were affixed on the closed door as the recipients were reported to have
married and were not residing at the given address.
</p>
<p id="p_7">4.           Sri B.C. Pande, learned Senior Counsel appearing on
behalf of the petitioner, would submit that respondents 3 to 5 are the
only legal heirs of the second respondent; and, since substituted
service of notice by way of newspaper publication has already been
made, the requirement of the notice being served on the respondents
has been complied with; the report submitted by the District Judgeship
of Dehradun to this Court shows that the subject premises is locked,
and no one is in physical occupation thereof; and, in such
circumstances, this Court may be pleased to consider the applications
in M.C.C. No. 1186 of 2018, CLMA No. 13334 of 2018, M.C.C. NO.
584 of 2013 and CLMA No. 9972 of 2013; and thereafter hear Writ
Petition (M/S) No. 2675 of 2001 on its merits.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                    3</span>




<p id="p_8">5.           Writ Petition (M/S) No. 2675 of 2001 was filed by the
Life Insurance Corporation of India (the petitioner herein) seeking a
writ of certiorari to quash the order of the Additional District Judge in
Misc. Civil Appeal Nos. 21 of 1981 and 22 of 1982 dated 20.11.1982
whereby the appeals, filed by respondents 2 to 5 in the writ petition,
were allowed; and the orders passed by the Estate Officer dated
16.01.1981 were set aside.
</p>
<p id="p_9">6.           As is evident from a bare reading of the order of the
Additional District Judge dated 20.11.1982, the Life Insurance
Corporation of India is the landlord and owner of the subject building,
in which respondents 2 to 5 herein (appellants before the Additional
District Judge) were the tenants. The Life Insurance Corporation of
India had issued a notice on 30.05.1979 terminating their tenancy and
had, thereafter, moved an application before the Estate Officer, under
the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1506082/" id="a_1">Public Premises (Eviction of Unauthorised
Occupants) Act</a> seeking their eviction from the subject premises. The
Estate Officer had, by his order passed under <a href="/doc/27902/" id="a_2">Sections 5</a> &amp; <a href="/doc/1376406/" id="a_3">7</a> of the
Public Premises (Eviction of Unauthorised Occupants) Act dated
16.01.1981, directed eviction of respondents 2 to 5.           On their
preferring appeals there-against, the Additional District Judge had set
aside the order passed by the Estate Officer, and had allowed the
appeals. The eviction proceedings initiated by the Life Insurance
Corporation of India was set at naught by the Additional District
Judge. The challenge to this order of the Additional District Judge, in
Writ Petition (M/S) No. 2675 of 2001, was rejected by a learned
Single Judge of this Court by his order dated 19.07.2006.
</p>
<p id="p_10">7.           In his order, in Writ Petition (M/S) No. 2675 of 2001
dated 19.07.2006, a learned Single Judge of this Court observed that
the list had been revised; none appeared for the petitioner to press the
writ petition; and he had gone through the record and found no merit
in the writ petition. The writ petition was, therefore, dismissed. The
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                        4</span>




said order dated 19.07.2006 was evidently passed in the absence of
the learned counsel for the petitioner, and except to hold that he found
no merit in the writ petition, the said order does not assign any reasons
why the learned Single Judge did not find any merit necessitating
dismissal of the said writ petition.
</p>
<p id="p_11">8.           MCC No. 584 of 2013 was filed by the Life Insurance
Corporation of India requesting this Court to recall the order passed in
Writ Petition (M/S) No. 2675 of 2001 dated 19.07.2006, whereby the
writ petition was dismissed. CLMA No. 9972 of 2013 was filed by
them seeking condonation of the delay of 2580 days in filing MCC
No. 584 of 2013.
</p>
<p id="p_12">9.           In his order, in MCC No. 584 of 2013 and CLMA No.
9972 of 2013 in Writ Petition (M/S) No. 2675 of 2001 dated
16.09.2013, the learned Single Judge observed that the grounds shown
for the delay were misconceived; the counsel on behalf of the
petitioner had filed his Vakalatnama on 28.12.2002; the Court had
directed that the petition be listed, showing the name of the learned
counsel for the petitioner, on 26.02.2003; the writ petition was
dismissed for want of prosecution on 19.07.2006 for which a recall
application had been filed after a long delay of 2580 days; the reasons
assigned for recalling the order was that the Regional Office,
Dehradun came to know in 2013 about the dismissal of the writ
petition, after receiving the record from the Regional Office at
Lucknow; this contention could not be accepted for the simple reason
that, since the petitioner had engaged the counsel in the year 2002
itself, thereafter it was the duty of the Company to pursue its case
through counsel; it was the fault of the Company in prosecuting the
case; the delay was callous and no explanation had been given in the
affidavit indicating who made an inspection of the record, and when a
copy of the order was obtained from Court; in so far as the ground that
the counsel could not mark the case from the cause list is concerned,
no affidavit of the Clerk of the Counsel had been filed; the present
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                    5</span>




counsel, who had filed the present restoration application, was not the
counsel at that time; and he found no ground to recall the order passed
by the Court.      The learned Single Judge dismissed the Delay
Condonation Application as well as the restoration application by his
order dated 16.09.2013.
</p>
<p id="p_13">10.          MCC No. 1186 of 2018 is filed by the Life Insurance
Corporation of India to recall the order passed by this Court, in MCC
No. 584 of 2013 and CLMA No. 9972 of 2013 in Writ Petition (M/S)
No. 2675 of 2001 dated 16.09.2013. CLMA No. 13334 of 2018 is
filed to condone the delay of 1777 days in filing MCC No. 1186 of
2018. In the affidavit filed in support thereof, the Manager (Legal) of
the petitioner-Corporation states that the petitioner had moved a
restoration application to recall the order dated 19.07.2006; the said
application was dismissed by the Court, by its order dated 16.09.2013,
holding that there was an inordinate delay in filing the restoration
application, and the delay was not properly explained; the earlier
counsel, who had been engaged to appear in the aforesaid writ
petition, had failed to file the restoration application; the Corporation
was dealing with more than 100 cases, under the Public Premises
Eviction Act, in the State of Uttarakhand when the restoration
application was dismissed on 16.09.2013; in view of the difficulties in
other cases, the writ petition was left unmarked by the officials of the
petitioner-Corporation; it is only when the list of cases pending before
the High Court was prepared by the petitioner-Corporation, did it
come to light that the said writ petition was dismissed on 19.07.2006,
and the application to restore the writ petition had also been dismissed
on 16.09.2013; the petitioner-Corporation thereafter sought legal
advise from its counsel regarding restoration of the writ petition;
legal advise was given for an application to be filed to recall the order
dated 16.09.2013, by which the restoration application of the
petitioner-Corporation in M.C.C. No. 584 of 2013 was dismissed by
this Court; sanction, to file a recall application, was received by the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                    6</span>




counsel on 21.08.2018; and an          application was, thereafter, filed
seeking recall of the order dated 16.09.2013.
</p>
<p id="p_14">11.   On facts, it is stated that sixty cases of a similar nature as the
present case, relating to the very same building, i.e. the Bharat Estate
Building, New Cannaught Place, Dehradun, were allowed by this
Court recently; and therefore, in the interest of justice, the delay in
filing the recall application may be condoned, and the order dated
16.09.2013 as well as the order dated 19.07.2006 may be recalled.
</p>
<p id="p_15">12.   On merits, the case of the petitioner-Corporation is that the
respondents were in unauthorized occupation of a part of Bharat
Estate Building, New Cannaught Place, Dehradun; the building
belongs to the petitioner herein; the learned District Judge had
allowed the appeal preferred by respondents 2 to 5 following the law
laid down by the Bombay High Court in <a href="/doc/1210149/" id="a_4">Elliot Waud And Hill Pvt.
Ltd. vs. Life Insurance Corporation</a> (judgment in Misc. Petition
No. 458 of 1979 dated 06.03.1981), wherein it was held that the
<a href="/doc/1506082/" id="a_5">Public Premises (Eviction of Unauthorised of Unauthorised
Occupants) Act</a>, 1971 suffered from lack of legislative competence in
Parliament to make such a law which was referable to Entry-18 of
List-II of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India; and the
provisions of the said Act could not be made applicable to the subject
building, in view of the provisions of the Uttarakhand Urban Building
(Regulation of Letting, Rent and <a href="/doc/463150/" id="a_6">Eviction) Act</a>, 1972 to the contrary.
</p>
<p id="p_16">13.          Sri B.C. Pandey, learned Senior Counsel appearing on
behalf of the petitioner, would contend that, after the judgment of the
Bombay High Court, the Supreme Court had, in <a href="/doc/1732040/" id="a_7">Accountant and
Secretarial vs. Union of India and others</a> : AIR 1988 SC 1708, held
that the <a href="/doc/1506082/" id="a_8">Public Premises (Eviction of Unauthorised Occupants) Act</a>,
1971 was referable to Entries 6, 7 and 13 of List-III of the Seventh
Schedule to the Constitution; consequently, in view of <a href="/doc/344383/" id="a_9">Article 254(1)</a>
of the Constitution, subsequent parliamentary legislation would
prevail, and the earlier State enactment would be void to the extent it
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                      7</span>




is repugnant to the Central enactment; and, in the light of the law laid
down by the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/453977/" id="a_10">Ashoka Marketing Ltd. and another
vs. Punjab National Bank and others</a> : (1990) 4 SCC 406, the
<a href="/doc/1506082/" id="a_11">Public Premises (Eviction of Unauthorised Occupants) Act</a>, 1971
would operate even for those establishments which may, otherwise,
have fallen within the ambit of the State Rent Control legislation.
</p>
<p id="p_17">14.            These legal contentions, urged on behalf of the
petitioner-Corporation by Sri B.C. Pande, learned Senior Counsel, on
the merits of the order passed by the Additional District Judge, would
necessitate detailed examination in case the aforesaid applications are
allowed, and Writ Petition (M/S) No. 2675 of 2001 is restored to file.
While considering the present applications, we must draw a
distinction between a statutory Corporation, established in public
interest by a law made by Parliament, and its officers; and consider
whether the Corporation should be deprived of its valuable property
for the negligence of its officers in diligently prosecuting the lis.
</p>
<p id="p_18">15.            It is useful in this context to refer to the relevant
provisions of the <a href="/doc/1643240/" id="a_12">Life Insurance Corporation Act</a>, 1956 (for short the
'1956 Act'). <a href="/doc/1796191/" id="a_13">Section 3</a> thereof relates to 'Establishment and
incorporation of the Life Insurance Corporation of India' and under
sub-Section (1) thereof, with effect from such date as the Central
Government may by notification in the Official Gazette appoint, there
shall be established a Corporation called the Life Insurance
Corporation of India.      A notification was issued by the Central
Government on 30.08.1956, from which date the LIC of India came to
be established.    <a href="/doc/1796191/" id="a_14">Section 3(2)</a> of the 1956 Act stipulates that the
Corporation shall be a body corporate having perpetual succession
and a common seal with power, subject to the provisions of the 1956

and be sued.

capital of the Corporation shall be one hundred crore of rupees
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                     8</span>




provided by the Central Government after due appropriation made by
Parliament by law for the purpose. <a href="/doc/1546239/" id="a_16">Section 6</a> of the 1956 Act relates to
functions of the Corporation and under sub-Section (1) thereof,
subject to the rules, if any, made by the Central Government in this
behalf, it shall be the general duty of the Corporation to carry on life
insurance business, whether in or outside India, and the Corporation
shall so exercise its powers under the 1956 Act as to secure that life
insurance business is developed to the best advantage of the
community.

<p id="p_20">17.          <a href="/doc/309517/" id="a_17">Section 6(2)(c)</a> of the 1956 Act confers power on the
Corporation to acquire, hold and dispose of any property for the
purpose of its business, and <a href="/doc/309517/" id="a_18">Section 6(2)(i)</a> confers power on the
Corporation to do all such things as may be incidental or conducive to
the proper exercise of any of the powers of the Corporation. <a href="/doc/1376406/" id="a_19">Section 7</a>
of the 1956 Act relates to transfer of assets and liabilities of existing
insurers on controlled business, and under sub-Section (1) thereof, on
the appointed day (1st September 1996), there shall be vested in the
Corporation all the assets and liabilities appertaining to the controlled
business of all insurers. <a href="/doc/1506082/" id="a_20">Section 21</a> of the 1956 Act requires the
Corporation to be guided by the directions of the Central Government

shall perform all such functions of the Corporation as may be
delegated to him with respect to the area within the jurisdiction of the

year. <a href="/doc/1506082/" id="a_25">Section 28</a> of the 1956 Act provides for the manner in which the
surplus from life insurance business is to be utilized and, in terms
thereof, ninety per cent or more of such surplus, as the Central
Government may approve, shall be allocated to or reserved for the life
insurance policyholders of the Corporation. <a href="/doc/1506082/" id="a_26">Section 29</a> requires the
Central Government to cause a report of the auditors under <a href="/doc/1506082/" id="a_27">Section
25</a>, and the report giving an account of the activities of the
Corporation under <a href="/doc/1506082/" id="a_28">Section 27</a>, to be laid before both Houses of
Parliament as soon as may be after each such report is received by the
Central Government.
</p>
<p id="p_23">20.          In terms of <a href="/doc/1796191/" id="a_29">Section 3(2)</a> of the 1956 Act, the Life
Insurance Corporation of India is a body corporate with power to hold
and dispose of property.      It is for the purpose of enabling it to
discharge its functions under the Act, that <a href="/doc/1506082/" id="a_30">Section 23</a> of the 1956 Act
enables the Life Insurance Corporation to employ such number of
persons as it thinks fit. As the Life Insurance Corporation is a distinct
legal entity having perpetual succession and employs officers only to
enable it to discharge the functions under the Act, it is difficult to hold
that the Life Insurance Corporation of India should be deprived of its
right to hold its property for all times to come, for the indifference
exhibited by its officers. As the duty of the Corporation is to carry on
the business of life insurance and to exercise its powers to ensure that
the life insurance business is developed to the best advantage of the
community, and not less than 90% of its surplus is required to be
allocated or reserved for life-insurance policy holders (i.e. the public
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                    10</span>




at large), the question which also necessitates examination is whether,
in the light of the order passed in Writ Petition (M/S) No. 2675 of
2001 dated 19.07.2006 (recall of which is sought) the petitioner, (a
statutory Corporation created under a law made by Parliament, and a
juristic person), for the fault of its officers and employees, should be
disabled from reclaiming possession of the subject premises forever,
though it is admittedly the owner of the building, even without their
challenge to the order of the Additional District Judge dated
20.11.1982, (allowing the appeal preferred by respondents 2 to 5 and
setting aside the order of their eviction passed by the Estates Officer),
being adjudicated on its merits.
</p>
<p id="p_24">21.          While the officers of the Corporation have, no doubt,
been grossly negligent in not pursuing the matter diligently, a
statutory Corporation, which is a juristic person created in larger
public interest of providing life insurance benefits to the general
public, cannot be made to suffer the loss of its valuable property (said
to be presently worth nearly Rupees One Crore) for no fault of theirs,
but for the fault of its officials in repeatedly not approaching this
Court on time. Public property cannot be permitted to be usurped by
those in possession thereof as tenants, for the indifference and apathy
of public servants; and, while the officers involved must be sternly
dealt with, private individuals cannot be permitted to knock away
valuable public property as that would contravene larger public
interest. For their failure to diligently prosecute the lis, disciplinary
action should be taken against the concerned officers, instead of
penalizing the Life Insurance Corporation by depriving it of its
valuable property.
</p>
<p id="p_25">22.          The delay in seeking restoration of the earlier recall
application is no doubt inordinate, as the delay is of 1777 days. The
reasons furnished, in the affidavit filed in support of the application
seeking condonation of delay, is also perfunctory and leave much to
be desired. The fact, however, remains that the jurisdiction which the
High Court exercises under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_31">Article 226</a> <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_32">/ 227</a> of the Constitution of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                    11</span>




India is in larger public interest, and safeguarding public property
owned by a statutory Corporation is undoubtedly in public interest.
While the inordinate delay cannot be ignored, this Court must ever
remain conscious of the consequence of its exercising restraint, as that
would only result in the petitioner-Corporation losing its right to claim
possession of the subject property, of which it is the owner, for all
times to come.
</p>
<p id="p_26">23.          While the delay is, no doubt, for a considerable length of
time, respondents 3 to 5 would not suffer irreparable injury or
substantial prejudice if the delay is condoned, for they have, on
account of the delay on the part of the officers of the LIC in
prosecuting the case diligently, retained possession of the subject
premises for the past more than four decades at the measly rent
stipulated several decades ago. The subject property situated in the
midst of Dehradun city, the capital of the State of Uttarakhand, would
undoubtedly fetch a huge amount of rent which, but for the
indifference exhibited by the officers of the LIC, would have been
payable by the occupants of the premises such as respondents 2 to 5 to
the petitioner-LIC. Having benefitted, by the failure of the officers of
the LIC to prosecute the litigation diligently, respondents 2 to 5 can
hardly complain of any prejudice being caused to them if the delay
were to be condoned.
</p>
<p id="p_27">24.          As the subject property is said to be worth nearly Rupees
one crore, I see no justification in depriving the statutory Corporation
of its judicial remedies to seek enforcement of its rights to regain
possession of its valuable property, for the fault of its officers and
employees in not diligently prosecuting the lis, and instead consider it
appropriate to condone the delay on terms.
</p>
<p id="p_28">25.          In the larger public interest of safeguarding public
property, of which the Life Insurance Corporation of India is
admittedly the owner, I consider it appropriate to condone the delay of
1777 days in filing MCC No. 1186 of 2018 and to allow CLMA No.

584 of 2013 and CLMA No. 9972 of 2013 in Writ Petition (M/S) No.
2675 of 2001 dated 16.09.2013, since the learned Judge, while passing
the order dated 16.09.2013, failed to notice the distinction between the
statutory corporation - a juristic person under the 1956 Act and its
officers in considering whether or not to condone the delay in CLMA
No. 9972 of 2013; and to condone the delay of 2580 days in filing
MCC No. 584 of 2013 subject to the following terms :
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">      (A)    The petitioner-Corporation shall pay costs of Rs. 1 lac
      which, ordinarily, would have been directed to be paid to the
      respondents. Since the whereabouts of respondents 3 to 5 is not
      known, they have not entered appearance through counsel
      despite substituted service by way of paper publication, and as
      the subject premises is stated to be under lock and key, I direct
      the petitioner-Corporation, instead, to pay the said costs of Rs.
      1.00 lac to the Uttarakhand State Legal Services Authority
      within six weeks from today.

<blockquote id="blockquote_2">      (B)    The petitioner-Corporation shall identify those officials,
      who were grossly negligent in discharging their duties of
      diligently prosecuting the lis, and who were responsible for the
      inordinate delay in filing appropriate applications before this
      Court, and initiate disciplinary action against them, besides
      recovering the costs of Rs. 1.00 lac, which the Corporation has
      been directed to pay, from them.

directed hereinabove, to the Uttarakhand State Legal Services
Authority, CLMA No. 1334 of 2018, MCC No. 1186 of 2018 and
CLMA No. 9972 of 2013 in Writ Petition (M/S) No. 2675 of 2001
