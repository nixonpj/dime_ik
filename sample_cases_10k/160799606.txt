<p id="p_1">     Read the interim order dated 06-08-2014 in W.P.(C)

No.19430 and connected matters.
</p>
<p id="p_2">     2. These are Writ Petitions filed by the holders for

quarrying permit granted for extraction of granite and

also laterite.     They approached this court feeling

aggrieved by the order passed by the Respondents to

revoke the permit for want of environmental clearances,

citing that the Hon'ble Green Tribunal, New Delhi has

passed an interim order in O.A. No.171/2013, interdicting

the mining activity without obtaining environmental

clearances. The sole reason stated in the impugned order

is with reference to the order passed by the Green

Tribunal in the above matter. The order passed by the

Green Tribunal is placed before this Court. In fact, it is

an interim order.
</p>
<p id="p_3">W.P.(C) Nos.19430 &amp; connected cases. 2


</p><p id="p_4">       3. I have perused the orders of the Green Tribunal.

The Green Tribunal is seized of the issue regarding illegal

and impermissible mining activities going on in the banks

of rivers Yamuna, Ganga, Champel, Gaunti and Revathi

amongst others. The illegal removal of minerals from the

river beds is causing serious threat to the flow of the

river, forests upon river bank and most seriously to the

environment of these areas. As revealed from the order

itself, the matter seized by the Tribunal is regarding the

river sand mining.              States have appeared before the

Tribunal. Based on the direction of the Tribunal States

were directed to file reply.              The State of Kerala also

appeared before the Tribunal and sought time to file

reply. In the meanwhile, the State of Kerala has been

interdicted from granting any mining licence unless the

applicant for such licence possessed environmental

clearance and clearance from the Pollution Control Board

in accordance with law.              It is also ordered that in all

places where permission has been granted after the

passing of the order of the Green Tribunal, the

W.P.(C) Nos.19430 &amp; connected cases. 3


department shall take action for revocation of licences. It

appears that based on such direction, the official

respondent          took       the    decision to revoke the

licence/permission granted to the petitioners for quarrying

operations.
</p>
<p id="p_5">       4. This court by an interim order, after perusing the

order passed by the National Green Tribunal, stayed the

operation of the order revoking licence/permission.

</p><p id="p_6">       5.     Today, when the matter posted, the learned

Senior Government Pleader sought time for filing counter

affidavit. It is also submitted by the learned counsel that

the Government has withdrawn the order revoking the

permission, in view of the order passed by this Court.

The Government have no other reason other than the one

mentioned in the order to justify the action of revoking

the licence/permission. The reason resulting the action is

derived from the order passed by the Green Tribunal in

regard to the mining of the river sand. In context of the

issue before the Tribunal, an order has been passed by

the Tribunal to revoke the licences which have been

W.P.(C) Nos.19430 &amp; connected cases. 4


issued after the order of the Tribunal, without obtaining

environmental clearances. This can only be referred to

sand mining operations.
</p>
<p id="p_7">       6. In view of the same, the impugned orders are not

sustainable and accordingly the impugned orders are set

aside.
</p>
<p id="p_8">       The Writ Petitions are disposed of as above.
