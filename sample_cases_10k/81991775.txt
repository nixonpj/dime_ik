<p id="p_3">              Heard Mr. Patel, learned Counsel for the applicants and Mr. Vyas,
learned Counsel for respondents No.1 and 2, at length.
</p>

<p id="p_4">2.            By this application under section 115 of the Code of Civil
Procedure, 1908 (for short 'C.P.C'), applicants, who are legal representatives of
original defendant No.4-Mushtaq Mohammed Siddique Ansari (for short
'Mushtaq') have challenged the judgment and decree dated 21 st November,
2014 passed by the learned trial Judge in R.A.E Suit No.997 of 2005 as also the
judgment and decree dated 5th December, 2018 passed by the Appellate Bench
of the Court of Small Causes at Mumbai in (A-1) Appeal No.79 of 2015. By
these orders, the Courts below decreed the suit instituted by respondents No.1
and 2, hereinafter referred to as 'plaintiffs' under section 16 (1) (e) of the
Maharashtra Rent Control Act, 1999 (for short 'Act') and directed defendant

                                                                                    1 of 6




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">       ::: Uploaded on - 20/06/2019                 ::: Downloaded on - 20/06/2019 22:26:29 :::</span>
                                                                 904-crast-7753-2019.odt

No.4 to hand over vacant and peaceful possession of Room No.13, situate on
the ground floor of Ansari Manzil, 4, Kharwa Galli, 1 st Lane, Trimbak Parsuram
Street, Mumbai 400 004 (for short 'suit premises').
</p>

<p id="p_5">3.           In support of this Petition, Mr. Patel submitted that plaintiff No.1
is the owner and landlady of Ansari Building. Suit premises was let out to one
Subrati Garibi (since deceased). Defendants No.1 to 3 are the heirs and legal
representatives of Subrati Garibi. He submitted that plaintiff No.1 and
defendant No.4 are relatives. There was understanding among plaintiff No.1,
defendant No.4 and legal representatives of the deceased tenant for
transferring the tenancy rights in favour of defendant No.4. Agreed
consideration for transferring tenancy was Rs.7,00,000/-. It was further agreed
that defendant No.4 will pay 75% of Rs.7,00,000/- to defendants No.1 to 3 and
25% of Rs.7,00,000/- to plaintiff No.1. He submitted that upon the assurance
given by plaintiff No.1 about transferring tenancy rights in favour of defendant
No.4, defendant No.4 paid valuable consideration to defendants No.1 to 3 and
obtained possession from them. Defendant No.4 is lawful tenant of the suit
premises. As plaintiff No.1 and defendant No.4 are relatives, no written
acknowledgment or writing was obtained from plaintiff No.1 regarding
understanding between the parties. He submitted that the application requires
consideration.
</p>

<p id="p_6">4.           On the other hand, Mr. Vyas supported the impugned orders. He
invited my attention to paragraph 7 of the written statement filed by defendant
No.4. In paragraph 7, defendant No.4 contended that plaintiff's brother Abdul
Hamid Ansari is managing the affairs of Ansari Building. Defendant No.4 was
interested in the suit premises and as such approached defendant No.2 and
showed his willingness to take the suit premises. Defendant No.4 insisted that
he will take the suit premises after rent receipt is transferred by the landlord

                                                                                      2 of 6

                                                               904-crast-7753-2019.odt

either in his name or his father's name. Accordingly, defendant No.2 took him
to the plaintiff and also her brother Abdul Ansari who informed defendant
No.4 that they have no objection if he takes the suit premises from defendant
No.2 provided defendant No.4 should pay them 25% of the market rent for
transfer of rent receipt of the suit premises in favour of either defendant No.4
or his father. Defendant No.4 accordingly paid amount of 75% share to
defendant No.2 and took possession of the suit premises on 13 th June, 2005.
Since 13th June, 2005, defendant No.4 is in possession of the suit premises as
tenant. Defendant No.4 along with defendant No.2 approached the plaintiff for
paying 25% transfer charges. The plaintiff, however, refused to transfer the
rent receipt in the name of defendant No.4 and insisted that unless and until
defendant No.4 pays transfer charges @ 33%, she is not willing to transfer
tenancy. Plaintiff No.1 started demanding Rs.3,31,000/- for transferring
tenancy rights.
</p>

<p id="p_7">5.            Mr. Vyas submitted that during the course of evidence, defendant
No.4 produced purported surrender letter dated 22 nd June, 2005 addressed to
landlord of Ansari Manzil. The said surrender letter is purportedly executed by
defendant No.2 Mohammed Rafiq Mohammad Ibrahim Ansari surrendering the
suit premises and tenancy rights in favour of defendant No.4 and requesting
the landlord to transfer rent bill in the name of defendant No.4-Mushtaq.
Defendant No.2 claimed to have relinquished all his rights in respect of the suit
premises and given no objection for executing fresh agreement of tenancy in
favour of defendant No.4. He also invited my attention to paragraph 3 of the
order dated 19th July, 2014 passed by the learned trial Judge on admissibility
of documents and cross-examination of defendant No.4. In the surrender letter
defendant No.2 contended that he has handed over possession of the suit
premises to defendant No.4. In the cross-examination, defendant No.4 deposed
that he took possession of the suit premises from his landlord i.e Abdul Hamid

                                                                                    3 of 6

                                                               904-crast-7753-2019.odt

Ansari. He further deposed that Mohammed Rafiq Ansari had handed over
possession of the suit premises to him.
</p>

<p id="p_8">6.            Mr. Vyas submitted that basically defendant No.4 has not
substantiated relationship between plaintiff No.1 and defendant No.4 as also
has not established payment of alleged transfer charges to defendants No.1 to
3 as also to plaintiff No.1. The rent receipt continued in the name of erstwhile
tenant Subrati Garibi. The Courts below after appreciating the evidence on
record have held that defendants No.1 to 3, legal representatives of original
tenant have unlawfully sublet the suit premises to defendant No.4. He,
therefore, submitted that no case is made out for interfering with the
impugned orders.
</p>

<p id="p_9">7.            I have considered the rival submissions advanced by learned
Counsel for the parties. I have also perused the material on record. As
mentioned earlier, defendant No.4 came with the case that plaintiff No.1 and
defendant No.4 are related. However, said contention is not substantiated by
adducing evidence. That apart, defendants No.1 to 3 did not enter into the
witness box. Defendant No.4 did not examine any independent witness to
substantiate his plea of understanding between plaintiff No.1 on one hand and
defendants No.1 to 3 and 4 on the other. The purported surrender letter is not
pleaded in the written statement. Photo copy of the surrender letter was
produced before the trial Court. Defendant No.4 contended that original
surrender letter is in the custody of the plaintiff. However, no attempt was
made calling upon the plaintiff to produce original surrender letter and also no
foundation was laid for adducing secondary evidence.
</p>

<p id="p_10">8.            In so far as judgment of the trial Court is concerned, the learned
trial Judge has referred to the decision of Joginder Singh Sodhi Vs. Amar

                                                                                    4 of 6




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">       ::: Uploaded on - 20/06/2019                 ::: Downloaded on - 20/06/2019 22:26:29 :::</span>
                                                                 904-crast-7753-2019.odt

Kaur (2005) 1 SCC, 31. The learned trial Judge has referred to section 26 of
the Act. In paragraph 20, the learned trial Judge observed that D.W.1 Mushtaq
admitted that plaintiff Abdul Hamid Ansari Mohammed had not given any
documentary evidence in writing for transfer of suit premises in his favour. The
learned trial Judge accordingly concluded that defendants No.1 to 3 have
parted with possession of the suit premises for monetary consideration to
defendant No.4. Plaintiffs have established ground of unlawful subletting.
</p>

<p id="p_11">9.            In so far as Appellate Court's judgment is concerned, after re-
appreciating the entire evidence on record, the Appellate Court had confirmed
the findings recorded by the trial Court. In paragraph 17, the Appellate Court
recorded that in the cross-examination, defendant No.4 Mushtaq                  admitted
that rent receipt of the suit premises is still in the name of the tenant Subrati
Garib (since deceased) and alleged surrender letter dated 22 nd June, 2005 at
Exhibit 64 does not bear signature of Abdul Hamid Ansari. In paragraph 19,
the Appellate Court concluded that legal representatives of the deceased
tenant, defendants No.1 to 3 sublet the suit premises to defendant No.4
without permission and consent of plaintiff No.1. Thus, after appreciating the
evidence on record, the Courts blow have concurrently decreed the suit under
section 16 (1) (e) of the Act.
</p>

<p id="p_12">10.            In the light of above discussion, it cannot be said that the findings
recorded by the Courts below while decreeing the suit under Section 16 (1) (e)
of the Act are contrary to the material on record. Applicants are not in a
position to demonstrate that the findings recorded by the Courts below are
perverse being based on no evidence or that on the basis of the material on
record, no reasonable or prudent person would have come to the conclusion
arrived at by the Courts below. Merely because on the basis of the material on
record, another view is possible that, by itself, is no ground for exercising the

                                                                                      5 of 6

powers under section 115 of C.P.C. In the result, the Civil Revision Application
fails and the same is dismissed.
