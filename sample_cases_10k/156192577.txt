<p id="p_1">             This is a petition that has been filed under <a href="/doc/1783708/" id="a_1">Section 438</a> Cr.P.C.

for grant of anticipatory bail to the petitioner in FIR No.243 dated

05.09.2015, in the night, her entire family was sleeping, when the

members, so that they could not wake up. In the meantime, the petitioner's

hand removed from her mouth and she started screaming and her brother

woke up. On this, the aforesaid persons escaped from the spot.

</p><p id="p_3">             Mr. Piyush Sharma, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the

petitioner argues that the petitioner has been falsely implicated in the

present case. It is submitted that a reading of the FIR would show that false

and frivolous allegations have been levelled by the complainant against the

petitioner herein. It is also contended that there is delay of 12 days in

registration of the FIR, which has not been explained.

</p><p id="p_4">             Per contra, Mr. V.G. Jauhar, learned senior DAG appearing on

behalf of the respondent-State opposes the grant of anticipatory bail to the

petitioner, while submitting that there are serious allegations levelled the

against the petitioner herein.
</p>
<p id="p_5">             I have heard learned counsel for the parties, apart from perusing

the pleadings.
</p>
<p id="p_6">             A reading of the FIR would go on to show that the petitioner

herein has been specifically named in the FIR along with co-accused Surjit

Singh by the minor victim. The petitioner-accused first entered the house of

the minor victim in the mid night and thereafter, with the help of co-accused

forcibly committed rape upon her.
</p>
<p id="p_7">             In the instant case, inter alia there are serious allegations of

forcibly committing rape upon a minor girl aged 13-14 years. The instant

FIR has been registered on 17.09.2015 whereas, the application for grant of

anticipatory bail came to be filed before the Sessions Judge, Ferozepur in

the month of March, 2018. Meaning thereby, the petitioner-accused herein

has approached the Court of Sessions for grant of anticipatory bail after a

period of almost two years and six months, from the date of registration of

the FIR and in the interregnum avoided the process of the court. The grant

of anticipatory bail is a discretionary relief. The conduct of the petitioner

and gravity of the offence committed has to be seen as well. In view of the

peculiar facts and circumstances of the present case and the gravity of the

allegations levelled against the petitioner herein, this court is of the

considered view that no ground is made out to grant the relief of

anticipatory bail to the petitioner. Accordingly, the petition in hand is

hereby dismissed, being devoid of any merits.

<p id="p_8">              However, anything observed hereinabove shall have no affect

on the merits of the case, which is only for the purpose of deciding the

anticipatory bail application.</p><pre id="pre_2">
