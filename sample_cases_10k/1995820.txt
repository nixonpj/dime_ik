                         --------------------
           Dated this the 10th day of August, 2009

                         JUDGMENT
</pre>

<p id="p_1">     The    vehicle  bearing       registration No.KL-13F/6412

belonging to petitioner was allegedly seized for infraction of

the provisions of the Kerala Protection of River Banks and

Regulation of Removal of sand Act, 2001. He has approached

the District Collector, the 1st respondent, for release of the

vehicle and is aggrieved by the non-consideration of the

request.
</p>
<p id="p_2">

</p><p id="p_3">2.   The nature of the power exercised by the District

Collector and the para meters within which such power is to

be exercised have been dealt with by a Bench of this Court in

Sanjayan Vs.Tahasildar [2007 (4) KLT 597]. Principles

have been reiterated in Subramanian Vs. State of Kerala

[2009 (1) KLT 77).
</p>
<p id="p_4">

</p><p id="p_5">3.    In Subramanian's case, this Court observed that the

power exercised by the District Collector is under Section 23

of the Kerala Protection of River Banks (Protection and

Regulation of removal of sand) Act, 2002.           It is also,

W.P.(C).22142/09
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                2</span>

therefore, quasi judicial in character. Reasons will have to be

given by the District Collector while passing orders under

Section 23 of the Kerala Protection of River Banks (Protection

and Regulation of removal of sand) Act, 2002 r/w Rules 27

and 28 of Kerala Protection of River Banks and Regulation

of Removal of Sand Rules 2002. If there is a contention that

the transportation of sand was supported by a pass issued by

the competent local authority, that has to be referred. The

materials which are placed before the District Collector by

the subordinate officials shall also be looked into.   This has

been indicated in Subramanian's case. If motion is made

by the owners of the vehicle for release of the vehicle on

interim custody, it will be subject to the conditions mentioned

in paragraph 58 of the said judgment. The District Collector

may pass orders on such applications for interim custody.

(The scope of the directions contained in Subramanian's

case    have later been dealt with in <a href="/doc/925008/" id="a_2">Sareesh v. District

Collector</a> (2009 (2) KLT 906). Appropriate clarifications

have been issued in the latter judgment). Further conditions

can be imposed in the course of release of the vehicle as

indicated by this Court in Shoukathali Vs. Tahasildar

[2009 (1) KLT 640].

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                               3</span>




</p><p id="p_7">4.    Keeping in mind the        observations made in       the

judgments in Shoukathali's case and Subramanian's case

and other judgment which have been referred to, the 1st

respondent      shall pass final orders in the matter of

confiscation/release   of  the   vehicle  in   question   after

conducting an appropriate enquiry as early as possible, at

any rate within three months from the date of receipt of a

copy of this judgment.
</p>
<p id="p_8">

</p><p id="p_9">5.    In the meanwhile, if motion is made by the petitioner

for interim custody of the vehicle, then      orders shall be

passed by the District Collector on the application for interim

custody of the vehicle, within three weeks from the date of

receipt of a copy of this judgment in the light of the

observations contained in Shoukathali Vs. Tahasildar

[2009 (1) KLT 640, Subramanian Vs. State of Kerala

[2009 (1) KLT 77) and <a href="/doc/925008/" id="a_3">Sareesh v.           District Collector</a>

(2009 (2) KLT 906).
</p>
<p id="p_10">

</p><p id="p_11">6.    I make it clear     that I have not considered        the

petitioner's contentions on merits.    It is upto the District

W.P.(C).22142/09
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                               4</span>

Collector to consider whether the vehicle is to be released

on interim custody or not.      It is also upto the District

Collector to consider, in accordance with law, the question as

to whether the vehicle in question has been used in a manner

as to contravene the provisions of the Act and the Rules

framed thereunder and as to whether the vehicle is liable for

confiscation and pass final orders on that basis.



</p><p id="p_12">      The writ petition is     disposed of as above.      The

petitioner    shall produce   copies  of   the   judgment   in

Subramanian, Shoukathali and Sareesh along with the

certified copy of this judgment before the 1st respondent, for

compliance.
