                   W.P.(C) No.9740 of 2010
                   ---------------------------------
            Dated this the 6th day of April 2010

<p id="p_1">     The petitioner is working as an Assistant Sub Inspector of

Police. In this writ petition, he assails Ext.P6 whereby he was

transferred from Attingal Police Station in Thiruvananthapuram

District to Pothencode Police Station in Kollam District.

</p><p id="p_2">     2.     A statement has been filed by the respondents in this

writ petition.    Paragraph 4 of the said statement assumes

relevance for the purpose of the case. The same reads thus :-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">      "There is written report that he has unholy nexus with
      notorious criminal and unfair relationship with some
      women.        The    Inspector    General      of   Police,
      Thiruvananthapuram Range, on getting such report
      about the ASI, considered his continuance in the
      District  as  undesirable    and   in   exercise    of his
      administrative   authority   transferred    him    to  the
      neighboring district in public interest. It is pertinent to
      note that ordinarily an ASI is liable to be posted
      anywhere within the Range."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_3">Based on the statement, the learned Government Pleader

submits that the petitioner has been placed under order of

transfer as per Ext.P6 on public interest as his continuance in

Thiruvananthapuram District is undesirable.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                -2-</span>


</p><p id="p_4">      3.   The learned counsel for the petitioner submits that

since the petitioner has already approached the 2nd respondent

through Ext.P8 representation, the 1st respondent may be

directed to consider Ext.P8 representation after affording an

opportunity of being heard.
</p>
<p id="p_5">      4.   Without making any observation as to the merits of

the rival contentions, this writ petition is disposed of with a

direction to the 2nd respondent to consider and pass orders on

Ext.P8 representation expeditiously, at any rate, within a period

of one month from the date of receipt of a copy of this judgment.

In view of the seriousness of the allegations raised against the

petitioner, it will only be appropriate to afford an opportunity of

being heard to the petitioner.     Therefore, the 2nd respondent

shall afford the petitioner an opportunity of being heard before

taking a decision on Ext.P8 as directed above.
