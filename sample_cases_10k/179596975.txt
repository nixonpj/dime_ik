<p id="p_1">     The petitioner has approached this Court with the

following prayers

          "i) to issue a writ of certiorari to quash Ext.P6 and P7
     orders and Ext.P8 and P9 demand notices
</p><p id="p_2">           ii) to declare that in the absence of rules prescribing
     the proceedural formalities as mandated in the Act, the
     sub section (2A) to section is inactive
</p><p id="p_3">             iii) to grant such other relief as this Hon'ble Court
     may deem fit and proper to grant in the circumstances of
     the case."
</p>
<p id="p_4">     2. When the matter came up for admission before this

Court it was submitted that an exactly similar matter

involving the very same issue was pending by way of W.P.

(C) No.30720 of 2007 wherein an interim stay was

granted.    It was accordingly, that this matter was also

admitted, granting interim stay in favour of the petitioner.

</p><p id="p_5">     3.   When the matter is taken up for consideration

today it is brought to the notice of this Court that the other

writ petition, which formed the basis for admission of the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1"> W.P.(C) NO.34043 OF 2007       2</span>

present writ petition, stands already disposed of, relegating

the petitioner therein to approach the statutory authority

for appropriate reliefs, giving consequential direction to the

concerned authority to have the matter considered and

disposed of in accordance with law. This being the position,

this Court does not find any reason to take a different

course, more so since the present writ petition was

admitted in view of the pendency of the other writ petition.

</p><p id="p_6">     4. In the above circumstances , this writ petition is

also disposed of, relegating the petitioner to avail the

statutory remedy. If any such appeal is filed within 'two

weeks' from the date of receipt of a copy of this judgment,

the same shall be considered by the concerned Appellate

Authority passing final orders in accordance with law, after

affording an opportunity of hearing to the petitioner, as

expeditiously as possible, at any rate within three months

from the date of receipt of a copy of this judgment.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">W.P.(C) NO.34043 OF 2007     3</span>

    The interim stay granted by this Court will continue till

such time.
