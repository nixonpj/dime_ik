and other persons of the locality  gathered  at the spot and due 

their interference the defendants, left the spot with the threat 

that they will come again at the suit property with greater force 

and will dispossess the plaintiff and his family members from 

the suit property.  It is the case of the plaintiff that the husband 

of defendant no.1 and the brother of defendant no.2 i.e Sh Om

  Parkash Sharma has expired on 9.12.08. It is further averred 

  that defendants alongwith   their musclemen again on 14.2.9 

  came at the suit property and started throwing the household 

  articles  of   the   plaintiff  but   when  the   people  of   the   locality 

  gathered   at   the   spot   and   intervened   into   the   matter,   the 

  defendants again left the spot threatening that they will come 

  again and will dispossess the plaintiff from the suit property 

  and that plaintiff made a complaint on the same day with local 

  police at PS Sultanpuri but the police did not take any action.

  no.1   filed   on   9.11.09.     Vide   order   dated   09.11.09,   Ld 

  Predecessor  struck off the defence of the defendant no.2  U/o 

  8   rule   1   CPC  with   limited   rights  to   the   defendant   to   cross 

  examine the plaintiff's witnesses.

  abuse of the process of law and has been filed with a view to 

  harras the defendants.  The said defendant has denied for want

                                                                               .

   from late Sh Om Parkash, her  husband  or that the possession 

   of   the   suit   property  was   handed  over   to   the   plaintiff.  It   is 

   further  contended on  behalf of said defendant that the  said 

   defendant has not visited the house of the plaintiff on 30.1.09 

   and 14.2.09 and has not extended any threat to the plaintiff 

   regarding dispossession from the suit property. 



</p><p id="p_7">5. On the pleading of the parties, following issues were framed:

</p><p id="p_8">   1. Whether the suit of the plaintiff is barred by any law and 

   hence liable to be dismissed/ rejected?OPD­1

</p><p id="p_9">   2.Whether the plaintiff is entitled to a decree for permanent 

   injunction against the defendant in respect of suit property as

</p><p id="p_15">7. The   defendant  no.1  chose   not   to   lead   any   evidence   in   her 

   defence.
</p>
<p id="p_16">8. I have heard Sh S.K. Vashisht  Ld counsel for the plaintiff and 

   Sh Mukesh Sharma Ld counsel for defendant no.1 and have 

   perused the record carefully.

<p id="p_17">

</p><p id="p_18">9. None had appeared on behalf of defendant n0.2. to address 

   final arguments.
</p>
<p id="p_19">10. Plaintiff  has filed  this suit on the claim that he had purchased 

   the   suit   property   from   Late   Sh   Om   Parkash   Sharma   vide 

   various document like G.P.A, will, agreement to sell, possession 

   letter,  receipt  etc  and  is   living  in  the  suit  property  with  his 

   family members and that defendants have tried to dispossess 

   him from the suit property on 30.1.09 and again on 14.2.10. 

   Defendant no.1 has denied  that she had tried to dispossess the 

   plaintiff from the suit property.   PW­1 has deposed as per the 

   plaint and as per the case of the plaintiff. The testimony of PW­

   1 completes  the chain of evidence   and successfully proves the 



                                                                             .

         case   of   the   plaintiff.    The   claim   of   the   plaintiff  regarding 

         ownership or in possession of the suit property has not been 

         controverted.   Only the contention of defendant no.1 is that 

         she   had   not  tried  to   dispossess     the   plaintiff  from   the  suit 

         property as alleged.   The plaintiff has stated on oath that he 

         had   purchased     the   suit   property   vide   various   aforesaid 

         documents and is living in the said property  and the same is in 

         her possession.   The said evidence has not been controverted 

         on   behalf   of   the   defendants   even   by   giving   any   contrary 

         suggestion.  Therefore,  I   am   of   the   considered   opinion  that 

         plaintiff   has   successfully   that   she   is   in   possession   of   suit 

         property   and   he   has   a   legal   right   to   get   her   possession 

         protected.  Consequently, the suit of the plaintiff is decreed as 

         prayed for and the defendant , their agent, servants,   agent, 

         representative   etc.   are   restrained   from   dispossessing   the 

         plaintiff  from  the  suit  property   without  due  process  of   law. 

         Decree sheet be prepared accordingly.   File   be   consigned   to 

         record room.
