<p id="p_1">1.                 By filing the present suit plaintiff seeking possession of the 

portion which is shown in red colour in the site plan allegedly occupied and 

in possession of the defendant which is situated on the first floor of the 

property bearing no. B­2/112, Nand Nagari, Shahdara, Delhi (herein after 

call suit property or property in question) on the ground that the property in

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">Civil Suit no. 252/07                                                 Page  NO. 1 / 18      </span>
 Shanti Devi W/o Sh. Ram Swaroop, who was the original allottee of the 

property by DDA who was the mother­in­law of the plaintiff and mother of 

the defendant as well as husband of the plaintiff for a total consideration of 

Rs.1,20,000/­ and Shanti Devi had executed registered GPA, registered 

Will, registered SPA, agreement to sell and receipt on 21.08.00.

</p><p id="p_2">2.                 It is contended that Shanti Devi was the mother of husband 

of the plaintiff and the defendant was the son of Sh. Beni Singh, who was 

the earlier husband of Shanti Devi and cousin brother of Ram Swaroop 

and later on Shanti Devi had re­married with the cousin brother of the Beni 

Singh i.e., Ram Swaroop.  Out of wed lock of Shanti Devi and Beni Singh, 

the defendant and his three sisters have been born and out of the wed­

lock of Shanti Devi and the Ram Swaroop, the husband of the plaintiff and 

his two sisters have been born.
</p>
<p id="p_3">3.                 It is further contended that keeping in view the relationship of 

Shanti Devi with the defendant being mother and son, she had permitted 

to the defendant to live in first floor of the suit property till the defendant 

makes his own house or plot which was got purchased by Shanti Devi (out 

of the sale proceed of the property in question Rs.95,000/­ has been spent 

towards the purchase of plot in favour of the defendant) in the name of 

defendant to settle him.   But time and again defendant permitted to stay 

for few further month which was considered and allowed by Shanti Devi on 

the pretext that the defendant be allowed to stay till she was alive which 

was also agreed by Pawan Singh who was husband of the plaintiff but in 


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">Civil Suit no. 252/07                                                Page  NO. 2 / 18      </span>
 the mid­night of 02.11.05  some  one came  to Shanti  Devi to  obtain her 

thumb impression while she was under influence of medicine and was not 

fully in conscious and when she awaken on the next day i.e, on 03.11.05 

she saw ink on her thumb and she doubted that somebody has taken her 

thumb impression that is why a complaint dated 03.11.05 had been made 

to   PS­   Nand   Nagari   and   subsequently   Shanti   Devi   had   died   on 

11.02.2006.
</p>
<p id="p_4">4.                 It   is   further   contended   that   in   the   month   of   March,   2006 

plaintiff   asked   to   defendant   to   vacate   the   first   floor   of   the   property   in 

question,   though   it   had   been   assured   even   on   05.06.06   the   defendant 

instead of vacating the property in question has filed a false suit against 

the   husband   of   the   plaintiff   on   the   basis   of   Will   allegedly   executed   by 

Shanti Devi in favour of the defendant on 03.11.05 which is apparently 

established   that   the   defendant   was   the   person   who   had   taken   thumb 

impression of the mother­in­law of the plaintiff.   Since, Shanti Devi has 

already   executed   the   title   documents   in   favour   of   the   plaintiff   on 

21.08.2000, hence, there is no question arose to execute any unregistered 

Will  allegedly executed  on  03.11.05 in  favour of the  defendant and  will 

dated 03.11.05 is forged and fabricated and cannot over riding the fact on 

the registered Will dated 21.08.00 executed by Shanti Devi in favour of the 

plaintiff   as   well   as   on   03.11.05   Shanti   Devi   was   not   the   owner   of   the 

property   in   question   as   such   the   suit   having   been   filed   by   defendant 

against the husband of the plaintiff was not maintainable and possession

 of the defendant qua the portion in the property in question is illegal and 

unauthorized as there is no legal right in favour of the defendant.  

</p><p id="p_5">5.                 Further,   in   furtherance   of   illegal   designs   the   defendant 

brought a party on 01.07.06 and was showing the premises in question 

and also negotiating with them to sell on the premium but due intercepted 

and interrupted by the plaintiff he is not succeed to adamant and continue 

threat to possession of the property resulting into filing the present suit 

while valued portion of the possession of the defendant of the property in 

question is Rs.1,00,000/­.
</p>
<p id="p_6">6.                 In   reply,   WS   filed   wherein   preliminary   objection   has   been 

taken with request to dismiss the suit on the ground that plaintiff has not 

approached   the   court   with   the   clean   hands   and   has   suppressed   the 

material   facts,   plaintiff   has   no   cause   of   action,   no   locus­standi,   suit   is 

barred   by   limitation,   suit   has   not   been   properly   verified   and   signed   by 

competent person, suit has not been properly valued and stamped and 

lastly suit is not maintainable as the provision of order 7 rule 14 CPC has 

not   been   complied.     On   merits   all   the   contents   of   the   plaint   has   been 

denied that Shanti Devi had executed any title documents in favour of the 

plaintiff and all documents seems prima facie forged and fabricated and 

created by the plaintiff in collusion with her husband to cause the wrongful 

loss to the defendant and to cause the wrongful gain to herself.

</p><p id="p_7">7.                 It is also denied that the Shanti Devi being the mother of the 

defendant had permitted at any time to defendant to live on the first floor of 


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">Civil Suit no. 252/07                                                         Page  NO. 4 / 18      </span>

question cannot be said unauthorized in any manner and further denied 

that out of the sale consideration as alleged by the plaintiff, Shanti Devi 

had spent Rs.95,000/­ towards the purchase of peace of plot in favour of 

the defendant to settle him.
</p>
<p id="p_8">8.                 It is also contended that defendant has obtained the thumb 

impression of Shanti Devi when she was unconscious under the influence 

of medicine and Shanti Devi had made a complaint on 03.11.05 with the 

PS­ Nand Nagari.  However, it is contended that the Shanti Devi being the 

mother of the defendant had executed and bequeath a Will in favour of the 

defendant   and   the   husband   of   the   plaintiff   on   03.11.2005   and   after 

execution   of   the   Will,   it   was  orally   settled   between   the   husband   of  the 

plaintiff and the defendant that the entire ground floor of the property in 

question would be in favour of the husband of the plaintiff who would be 

exclusive   user   and   owner   and   the   entire   first   floor   upto   the   roof   rights 

would   be   gone   in   favour   of  the   defendant   who   would   be   the   user  and 

owner of his portion after the death of Shanti Devi who was mother of the 

defendant and husband of the plaintiff and since then defendant has been 

residing in to the portion of the first floor of the property in question being 

the owner.

</p><p id="p_10"> 9.                 It is specific contended that the factum of execution of title 

documents in favour of the plaintiff allegedly executed by mother of the 

defendant   Shanti   Devi   on   21.08.00   came   to   the   knowledge   of   the 

defendant when the husband of the plaintiff has filed WS in the earlier suit 

bearing No. VC­30/2006 having been filed by himself against the husband 

of the plaintiff.

herein that in the case titled as Suraj Lamp and Industries Pvt. Ltd. Vs. 

State of Haryana and Anr. 2011 X AD (SC) 365, it is ruled out that the 

transaction of the nature of GPA or Sale Agreement and Will transfer do 

not convey title and do not amount to transfer to another which can be 

recognized as a valid mode of transfer of immovable property. The court 

will not treat such transaction as completed or concluded transfer or as a 

conveyance   as   they   neither   convey   the   title   nor   create   any   interest   in 

immovable property. They cannot be recognized as deed of title except to 

the limited extent of <a href="/doc/1693670/" id="a_1">section 53</a> A of TP Act. 
</p>
<p id="p_23">14.                Since in the present case, it is admitted by the plaintiff that 

she   claimed   her   ownership   on   the   basis   of   GPA,   Registered   Will, 

Registered SPA, Agreement to Sell and receipt dated 21.08.2000, but in 

view of the Judgment captioned above the plaintiff cannot be said to be 

owner of the  portion i.e. First Floor of the property in  question. On the 

other hand the defendant claimed his ownership and seeking protection in 

respect   to   the   First   Floor   of   the   property   in   question   on   the   basis   that 

Shanti   Devi   who   was   the   mother   of   the   Defendant   has   executed   and 

bequeath  a Will in favour of the defendant on 03.11.2005 and contended 

that above caption of GPA,  Registered Will, Registered SPA, Agreement 


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">Civil Suit no. 252/07                                                             Page  NO. 7 / 18      </span>
 to Sell and receipt are forged and fabricated.  But no evidence lead as how 

the   documents  can   be   said  to   be   forged   and   fabricated.  However,   title 

document of the plaintiff cannot be considered as a Sale transaction of the 

immovable property i.e. the property in question as per the judgment of 

Hon'ble Supreme Court captioned above and defendant has proved the 

Will   Ex.   D­X   being   the   beneficiary   of   the   Will   which   is   also   counter 

opposed and contended that the Will is forged and fabricated in as much 

as on 03.11.2005 somebody took thumb impression of the mother of the 

defendant and mother in law of the plaintiff, to this effect a complaint dated 

03.11.2005 has been made alleging that Will is forged and fabricated. But 

surprisingly   no   evidence   has   also   been   led   by   the   plaintiff   which   can 

establish that the Will is forged and fabricated especially keeping in view of 

the fact that in the complaint dated 03.11.2005 there is nothing  mentioned 

that the Will has been executed by playing fraud and forgery. Even no 

explanation come up on record as why the complaint dated 03.11.2005 

has not been persuaded  and even  the  complaint dated 03.11.2005 Ex. 

PW­1/2 has not been proved.  The Ld. Counsel for the plaintiff, however, 

contended that since the complaint has been filed by the mother­in­law of 

plaintiff, hence, she was suppose to continue the complaint and merely not 

pressing the complainant suit cannot be dismissed.  In this regard, it is not 

out   of   mentioned   to   place   here   that   bare   perusal   of   complaint   dated 

03.11.05, it reveals that nothing has been mentioned that the property in 

question has been sold to the plaintiff on 21.08.2000.

there is specific deposed that prior to this suit the defendant  has also filed

plaintiff and her husband from illegal deposition which has been decided in

what fact has been concealed and suppressed as such failed to discharge 

onus, hence, this issue is decided against the defendant and in favour of 

plaintiff.

<p id="p_29">18.                The onus to discharge this issue has been casted upon the 

defendant and defendant reproduced all contents of WS in his evidence. 

The contention that this suit of the plaintiff stand barred being filed after 

the 7 years of execution of documents. On the other hand, PW­1 plaintiff 

specifically deposed in para No.18 which is reproduced the cause of action 

para of the plaint and deposed that cause of action arose in favour of the 

plaintiff against the defendant when Late Smt. Shanti Devi has expired on 

11.02.2006 i.e., mother­in­law of the  plaintiff and mother of the defendant, 

when the request made to the defendant for possession of the property in 

question on 05.06.2006 and lastly on 01.07.2006 when defendant refused 

same but no cross examination was done on this point.  Since the issue is 

relating to the law point and it is well settled law, a suit for possession can 

be filed within 12 years as per <a href="/doc/948485/" id="a_2">article 65</a> of <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_3">Limitation Act</a> from the date of

<p id="p_30">19.                The onus has been casted upon the defendant to discharge 

this issue, but no evidence  has been  lead  by the defendant which can 

substantiate that the  plaintiff has no locus­standi to file the present suit but 

it is otherwise ruled out in the judgment titled Suraj Lamp and Industries 

Pvt. Ltd. Vs. State of Haryana and Anr. 2011 X AD (SC) 365, since the 

GPA,   Agreement   to   sell,   will,   receipt   does   not   confirm   any   title   or 

ownership right to the plaintiff but such documents create certain right in 

an immovable property in this regard reliance can be placed on case titled 

Sh.   Ramesh   Chand   Vs.   Suresh   Chand   &amp;   Anr.   188(2012)   DLT   538,

other hand, in para No. 20 of the plaint, the valuation of the portion of the 

suit property has been done or valued as Rs.1 lakh for the purpose of

<p id="p_33">21.                The   onus   of  both   issues  are   casted   upon   the  plaintiff   and 

basic question is that whether on basis of GPA, Agreement to Sell, Will a 

possession   or   injunction   decree   can   be   passed   or   not   without   seeking 

cancellation of alleged forged Will dated 03.11.2005?

</p><p id="p_34">22.                Since, Hon'ble Supreme  Court of India in case  titled  Suraj 

Lamp and Industries Pvt. Ltd. Vs. State of Haryana and Anr. 2011 X AD 

(SC)   365,    it   is   held   that   GPA,   Agreement   to   Sell,   Will   cannot   be 

considered as a titled document for transfer of movable property but in the 

case Sh. Ramesh Chand Vs. Suresh Chand &amp; Anr. 188(2012) DLT 538, 

the Hon'ble High Court of Delhi has observed in para 2 of the judgment 

that "a reference to the aforesaid paras shows that unless there is a  

proper registered sale deed, title of an immovable property does not  

pass. The Supreme Court has however reiterated that rights which  

are created pursuant to <a href="/doc/221518/" id="a_4">Section 53A</a> of the Transfer of Property Act,  

1882   dealing   with   the   doctrine   of   part   performance   (para   12),   an  

irrevocable right of a person holding a power of attorney given for  

consideration   coupled   with   interest   as   per   <a href="/doc/1543384/" id="a_5">Section   202</a>   of   the  

Contract Act, 1872 (para 13) and devolution of interest pursuant to a  

Will (para 14). Therefore, no doubt  a person strictly may not have  

complete   ownership   rights   unless   there   is   a   duly   registered   sale  

deed,   however,   certain   rights   can   exist   in   an   immovable   property  

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">Civil Suit no. 252/07                                                      Page  NO. 12 / 18      </span>
 pursuant to the provisions of <a href="/doc/221518/" id="a_6">Section 53A</a> of the Transfer of Property  

Act, 1882, <a href="/doc/1543384/" id="a_7">Section 202</a> of the Contract Act, 1872. There also takes  

place devolution of interest after the death of the testator in terms of  

a Will" 
</p>
<p id="p_35">23.                Further, it was observed by the Hon'ble High Court of Delhi 

that   the   object   of   giving   validity   to   a   power   of   attorney   given   for 

consideration  even  after  the  death  of the  executants is  the  ensure  that 

entitlement under such power of attorney remains because the same is not 

regular or a routine power of attorney but the same had elements of a 

commercial   transaction   which   cannot   be   allowed   to   be   frustrated   on 

account of death of executant of power of attorney.
</p>
<p id="p_36">24.                Lastly, the Hon'ble High Court of Delhi has held in para 6 of 

the   judgment   that   "the   respondent   no.   1   /   plaintiff   appeared   in   the  

witness box and proved the documents dated 16­05­1996 being the  

agreement to sell (Ex.PW1/2), General Power of Attorney (Ex.PW1/6),  

Affidavit   (Ex.PW1/3),   Receipt   for   Rs.1,40,000/­   (Ex.PW1/4)   and   Will  

(Ex.PW1/5). The respondent no. 1 / plaintiff also got support of their  

stand   from   the   depositions   of   the   attesting   witnesses   to   the  

documents   namely   Sh.   Munir   Ahmed   who   was   examined   as   PW­3  

and Sh. Shri Ram was examined as PW­4. Brother of the parties Sh.  

Ram Swaroop, deposed in favour of the respondent no. 1 / plaintiff  

as PW­2" and in respect to the will in my opinion, the judgement of the  

Supreme Court in the case of Kashibai &amp; Anr. (supra), and various  

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">Civil Suit no. 252/07                                                    Page  NO. 13 / 18      </span>
 other judgements which deal with the issue of requirement of a Will  

having   to   be   proved   by   summoning   of   an   attesting   witness,   are  

judgements given in those cases where there are inter se disputes  

between the legal heirs of a deceased testator and the validity of the  

Will is questioned in those circumstances. Observations in the said  

judgments cannot have application to the facts of those cases where  

the disputes with regard to Will are not classical disputes between  

the legal heirs of the deceased testator and the Will is an instrument  

which   really   furthered   an   intent   to   transfer   the   rights   in   an  

immovable property by the testator to the beneficiary. I may note that  

in the present case, there is absolutely no cross examination at all  

on behalf of the appellant when the registered Will was proved and  

exhibited in the statement of the respondent no. 1 / plaintiff as PW­1.  

Once   there   is   no   cross   examination,   in   the   cases   such   as   the  

present, which are different than the classical disputes inter se the  

legal heirs of a deceased testator, I would feel that the Will should be  

held to be a proved document  in as much as the object of the Will in  

cases   such   as   the   present   was   really     to   transfer   rights   in   an  

immovable   property   after   the   death   of   the   testator.   Further,   I   may  

note   that   the   observations   with   respect   to   Will   having   to   be   very  

strictly proved by calling the attesting witness are in probate cases  

where   the   judgment   is   a   judgment   in   rem   whereas   in   the   present  

case the judgment on the basis of ownership rights devolving upon

 the respondent no. 1/ plaintiff under a Will not be a judgment in rem  

but only a judgment inter se the parties. 
</p>
<p id="p_37">25.                Now turning to the evidence led by the parties in the present 

case.     Admittedly  in   the   present   case,   the   alleged   will   in   favour  of  the 

defendant has been executed on 03­11­2005 and this fact came to the 

knowledge     when   the   defendant   filed   suit   for   injunction   against   the 

husband of the plaintiff and disposed of after giving the statement of the 

husband of the plaintiff that they will not dispossess the defendant without 

following due process of law and filed present suit on 10­08­2006. Despite 

that no declaration qua the cancellation of alleged Will dated 03.11.2005 

has been prayed and at this stage, even it cannot be prayed as the period 

of cancellation of documents is for three years from the date of knowledge 

as in the present case, it was alleged that in June, 2006, defendant has 

filed a suit against the husband of the plaintiff. As I have earlier discussed 

that PW1 / plaintiff reproduced all the contents of the plaint and failed to 

lead evidence in respect to that how forgery has been committed by the 

defendant while preparing alleged Will. Even failed to prove the document 

Ex.PW1/2, which are genesis to the present case and raised contention 

that the will dated 03­11­2005 is forged and fabricated. 

</p><p id="p_38">26.                Here   it   is   also   not   out   of   mention   to   place   here   that   the 

present   suit   has   been   filed   by   the   plaintiff   on   10­08­2006   whereas   the 

mother of the defendant has expired on 11­02­2006. Further admittedly 

the complaint dated 03­11­2005 has been filed or made by the mother in 


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">Civil Suit no. 252/07                                                            Page  NO. 15 / 18      </span>
 law of the plaintiff and mother of the defendant despite that it has not been 

pressed either by the mother­in­law of plaintiff or by the plaintiff herself 

especially when the suit property has been purchased in the year 2000 

which would hamper on the right, title and interest of plaintiff in respect to 

the property in question.
</p>
<p id="p_39">27.                Further, there is no out of stress of imagination that in case a 

person   finds   that   somebody   has   taken   his/her   thumb   impression   after 

executing of transfer of immovable property in favour of anyone as in the 

present   case   in   favour   of   plaintiff,   he   or   she   would   not   even   made   or 

incorporate   the   fact   of   earlier   execution   of   the   documents   in   the 

subsequent   complaint.   Bare   perusal   of   complaint   Ex.PW1/2   as   such 

nothing has been mentioned by the mother in law of the complaint and the 

mother of the defendant which can suggest that she had ever executed 

any document i.e. GPA, Agreement to Sell or Will in favour of the plaintiff, 

which   casts     doubt   for   the   execution   of   the   document   in   favour   of   the 

plaintiff. 
</p>
<p id="p_40">28.                In view of the observations made by the Hon'ble High Court 

of Delhi in para 12 while deciding RFA No. 865/03 on 8th  May, 2012 in 

case titled  Shri Man Mohan Batra Vs. Shri Bharat Bhushan Batra &amp; 

Ors. that "A civil case is decided on balance of probabilities.  In civil case, 

after evidence led by the parties the court put the same in a melting pot so 

as to decide the final picture which has to emerge therefrom", I am of the 

considered view that after the death of Smt. Shanti Devi, there is two will 


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">Civil Suit no. 252/07                                                       Page  NO. 16 / 18      </span>
 i.e., one which is in favour of the plaintiff and the other is in favour of the 

defendant and both will have been exhibited by both the beneficiary as 

Ex.PW1/3   and   Ex.DW1/1   /   Ex.DX   and   bare   perusal   of   both   Wills,   it 

revealed that will Ex.PW1/3 bequeath property in question only in favour of 

the plaintiff whereas the other will Ex.DW1/1 bequeath property in question 

in   favour   of   the   defendant   as   well   as   in   favour   of   the   husband   of   the 

plaintiff, and there is no stretch of out of imagination that in case a party 

wanted to cheat or defraud someone then why he create right or other 

share in the immovable property in favour of others as in the present case, 

the Will Ex.DW1/1 is in favour of both the brothers i.e., husband of the 

plaintiff and the defendant himself, hence, I declare the Will Ex.DW­1/1 

proved.
</p>
<p id="p_41">29.                After taking into consideration the facts and circumstances of 

the present case, I am of the further considered view that no decree of 

possession and injunction can be passed in favour of the plaintiff as no 

cancellation of alleged will dated 03­11­2005 has been made or prayed in 

the   present  suit   and   also   in   my   opinion,   the   suit   for  declaration   if   now 

sought to be amended to claim the relief would in the peculiar facts of this 

case be hopelessly barred by the limitation in as much as once ouster is 

clear   from   03.11.2005   or   June,   2006   the   period   of   3   years   expired   on 

03.11.2008   or   June,   2009   respectively   and   further   the   plaintiff   failed   to 

prove  that the will dated  3­11­2005 Ex.DW1/1  is forged and  fabricated. 

The registration of will does not make it anymore effective, hence, both
