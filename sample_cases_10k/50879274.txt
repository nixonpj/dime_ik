    record findings supported by reasons, on all issues arising along with




    the contentions put forth, and pressed by the parties for decision of the

    Appellate Court. While reversing a finding of fact, the Appellate Court

    must come into close quarters with the reasoning assigned by the trial

              "3. The first appeal has to be decided on facts as
              well as on law. In the first appeal parties have the




              right to be heard both on questions of law as also





              on facts and the first appellate court is required to
              address itself to all issues and decide the case by





              giving reasons. Unfortunately, the High Court, in the
              present case has not recorded any finding either on
              facts or on law. Sitting as the first appellate court it
              was the duty of the High Court to deal with all the
              issues and the evidence led by the parties before
              recording the finding regarding title."

              is a valuable right of the parties and unless
              restricted by law, the whole case is therein open for
              rehearing both on questions of fact and law. The

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_73">        5.    In view of the above salutary principles, on
        going through the impugned judgment, we feel that


        the High Court has failed to discharge the obligation
        placed on it as a first appellate court. In our view,
        the judgment under appeal is cryptic and none of




        the relevant aspects have even been noticed. The





        appeal has been decided in an unsatisfactory
        manner. Our careful perusal of the judgment in the





        regular first appeal shows that it falls short of
        considerations which are expected from the court of
        first appeal. Accordingly, without going into the
        merits of the claim of both parties, we set aside the
        impugned judgment and decree of the High Court
        and remand the regular first appeal to the High
        Court for its fresh disposal in accordance with law."
