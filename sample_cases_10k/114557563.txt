                  R/SCR.A/194/2018                                                   JUDGMENT




         issued      by      the      respondent              -    authority               in      show
         cause      notice           bearing         No.RB/HDP/106/2017                          under
         Section 56(A)(B) of the Bombay Police Act, 1951
         (for short the Act).
</p>
<p id="p_2">         2.   Heard       the        submissions              of       learned          advocates
         appearing for the petitioner and learned APP for
         the respondent State.
</p>
<p id="p_3">         3. The petitioner challenged the impugned show
         cause notice on various grounds that show cause
         notice      is     issued       without              application                of      mind,
         wherein       the          externing         authority              has        mentioned
         that     the       petitioner             should           be       externed              from
         districts          of       Surat      City,             Surat        Rural,            Tapi,
         Bharuch, Navsari and Valsad. No reason has been
         given in the show cause notice why, externment
         from     these          districts            was          proposed             when         the
         activity of the petitioner was confined only to
         District of Surat.
</p>
<p id="p_4">         4. Another contention has been that no reason has
         been    given         in      the     show           cause        notice            by      the
         externing authority as to why the petitioner was
         externed         from        five       districts               mentioned               above
         whereas, he is resident of District: Surat only.
         On all such grounds, learned advocate appearing
         on behalf of the of the petitioner prays to quash
         the impugned show cause notice.
</p>
<p id="p_5">         5. This argument has substance and it discloses
         non-application                of        mind            by       the          externing

         authority for externing the petitioner from five
         districts mentioned as aforesaid. When even an
         externing authority chooses to direct externment
         from   not       only      the      district              within           which          the
         person against whom the show cause notice issued
         is seen to be active, but also from contiguous
         districts, the reason why such show cause notice
         should operate even in regard to such contiguous
         districts should be shown in the notice. It must
         be so, if a person confined his activities to a
         particular            district,                 there          would             be           no
         justification to extern him not only from that
         district, but from the adjoining districts also
         unless     it     is      shown      that          circumstances                  warrant
         such a course. If there is such lacuna in the
         show cause notice, it is not for the court to
         fill up lacuna in the material noticed by the
         externing authority by assuming that there must
         be   some       reason      for       externing               from         contiguous
         district        also.      That       must         be     indicated               by      the
         externing authority. For this full bench decision

         notice and urged to dismiss the petition.
</p>
<p id="p_7">         7. The externing authority under Section 56(B) of
         the Act has power to remove or extern a person
         not     only      from     the     district              within           which          the
         externing         authority        has         jurisdiction,                 but       also
         from      the        districts          contiguous                 to        his         own
         district. The criteria for passing such an order
         is provided for in Section 56(B) and there must
         be some indication in the order itself of the
         existence of circumstances which would lead to
         the satisfaction of the authority that it was
         necessary not only to extern a person from his
         own     district           but    also            from        the         contiguous
         district. Such circumstances must be qua every
         area or region from which a person is directed to
         be externed and there must be some material or
         indication of such material in the order. The
         case of Vrajlal Mohanlal v. District Magistrate,
         Rajkot and another, reported in 3 G.L.R. 807 can
         be referred on the point.

         and     set     aside.      Rule       is      made        absolute              to      the
