               Mr. Sk. Abu Sufian,
                       ....... For the petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_3">               Mr. Hiranmoy Bhattacharyya,
                       ........ for the O.Ps


        Heard the learned advocates for both the sides.

        Mr. Hiranmoy Bhattacharyya, learned advocate is appearing on behalf of

the opposite parties. So service of notice upon the opposite party is dispensed

with.
</p>
<p id="p_4">        This application is at the instance of the added defendant and is directed

against the Order No. 107 dated 10.1.2011 passed by the learned Civil

Judge(Junior Division), 3rd Court at Baruipur in Title Suit No. 66 of 2003 thereby

rejecting an application under Order 39 Rule 7 of the Civil Procedure Code.

</p><p id="p_5">        The plaintiffs/opposite parties herein filed the suit for declaration and

permanent injunction. In that suit, the added defendant is contesting by filing a

written statement. The suit was at the stage of recording evidence on behalf of the

plaintiffs. At that time, the added defendant/petitioner herein filed the application

for local inspection. The suit land as appearing from the copy of the plaint has

been properly identified by giving the description of the same. The inspection has

been sought for 5 points and upon consideration of the grounds I find that the

first point is to bring to the court as to the nature of the suit land. As regards

point No.2, the petitioner has wanted to say whether there is any road on the said

land. But it is the specific case of the plaintiff that the concerned road is towards
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                             2</span>


the north of the suit land and there is no road on the suit land. As regards the

point No.3, the petitioner wanted to show whether there are any shops or rooms

on the suit land. This matter can also be decided by taking evidence in the Court,

if necessary. As regards the point No.5, the petitioner has wanted to bring notice

of the court whether there is any sign of using the suit land as play ground. It is

also not necessary because it can be decided either on the basis of the L.R.

Record or oral evidence to be adduced before the Court. The next point is for local

feature.
</p>
<p id="p_6">      This being the position, I am of the view that the proposed inspection is not

at all necessary and the learned trial Judge has rightly rejected the application.

Therefore, I am of the view that there is nothing to interfere with the impugned

order. The learned trial Judge is justified in rejecting the application for local

inspection.
</p>
<p id="p_7">      Accordingly, this revisional application is dismissed.

      There will be no order as to costs.
</p>
<p id="p_8">      Urgent Photostat certified copy, if applied for, be given to the learned

advocate for the parties upon compliance of necessary formalities.
