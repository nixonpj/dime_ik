                          ( Rassewak Singh and another Vs The State of M.P. )


Gwalior, Dated : 10/07/2019
        Shri Kuldeep Thapak, learned counsel for the applicant.

        Sri S.S. Rajput, learned Public Prosecutor for the

respondent-State.</pre>

<p id="p_1">         Learned counsel for the rival parties are heard.

        This petition has been filed, under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_1">section 482</a> of the Cr.P.C.,

seeking quashment of FIR registered at Crime No. 523/2017 at

Police Station       Maharajpura District Gwalior (M.P.) for the

offences punishable under <a href="/doc/988620/" id="a_2">sections 406</a>, <a href="/doc/1436241/" id="a_3">420</a> and <a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_4">34</a> of the IPC.

</p><p id="p_2">        During pendency of this petition filed under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_5">section 482</a> of

Cr.P.C., the petitioner    and the complainants have jointly filed

application under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_6">section 320(2)</a> of the Cr.P.C which was registered

as IA No4407/2019 stating that the dispute between the parties has

been resolved and they are not inclined to pursue the matter any

more.
</p>
<p id="p_3">        This Court, vide order dated 21/06/2019 had directed the

parties to appear before the Principal Registrar of this Court for

recording their statements and for verification of factum of

compromise. The Principal Registrar has submitted his report itself

and verified the compromise.

                         ( Rassewak Singh and another Vs The State of M.P. )


      In the cases of Jagdish Channa &amp; others Vs. State of

Haryana &amp; another (AIR 2008 SC 1968), Madan Mohan Abbot

Vs. State of Punjab (AIR 2008 SC 1969), Shiji Vs. Radhika &amp;

Another (2011) 10 SCC 705, and Narinder Singh &amp; others Vs.

State of Punjab (2014) 6 SCC 466, Supreme Court has laid down

that even in non-compoundable cases on the basis of compromise,

criminal proceedings can be quashed so that valuable time of the

court can be saved and utilized in other material cases. After hearing

the learned counsel for the parties and taking into account the law

laid down by the Apex Court, in the opinion of this court,

continuance of the prosecution in such matters will be a futile

exercise which will serve no purpose. Under such a situation,

<a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_7">section 482</a> Cr.P.C. can be justifiably invoked to prevent abuse of

the process of law and wasteful exercise by the courts below.

Moreso, the offence in question is not against the society but merely

affects the victim.
</p>
<p id="p_5">      Consequent upon the above said facts and that the accused

petitioners and the complainant/respondent have amicably resolved

the issue and the offence being compoundable with the permission

of the Court, this Court allows this MCRC with the following
