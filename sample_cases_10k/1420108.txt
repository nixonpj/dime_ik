JUDGMENT:
</pre><p id="p_1">		      J U D G M E N T
B.P.JEEVAN REDDY.J.
</p><p id="p_2">     Leave granted.
</p><p id="p_3">     The Bihar Legislature enacted the Bihar Tax on entry of
Goods into  Local Areas for consumption, use or sale therein
Act, 1993  providing for  levy of  tax on entry of scheduled
goods into a local area for consumption, use or sale therein
at a  rate, not	 exceeding five percent, as may be specified
by the State Government. The goods mentioned in the Schedule
are (i)	 motor vehicles,  (ii) tobacco	products  [excluding
beer is],  (iii) India-made  foreign liquors  (iv) vegetable
and hydrogenated  oils, (v)  cements and (vi) crude oil. The
Act replaces  Bihar Ordinance  No.19 of	 1993. [Indeed,	 the
said Ordinance	was preceded  by yet another Ordinance.] The
expression "Local Areas' is defined in clause (f) of Section
2 to  mean the	areas within  the limits  of a (i) Municipal
Corporation,  (ii)   Municipality,   (iii)   Notified	Area
Committee, (iv) Cantonment Board, (v) Town Board, (vi) Mines
Boards (vii) Municipal Boards (viii) Gram Panchayat and (ix)
any other  local authority  by whatever	 nomenclature called
constituted or continued under any law for the time being in
force.
</p><p id="p_4">     Section 3 is the charging section. The levy is upon the
entry of  scheduled goods into a local area for consumptions
use or	sale therein.  The proviso  to subsection 3 empowers
the  Government	 to  specify  different	 rates	of  tax	 for
different goods mentioned in the Schedule. Subsection (2) of
Section 3  says that  the tax under the Act shall be paid by
every dealer  liable to pay tax under the Bihar finance Act,
1981 (Sales Wax Act). Section 5 provides for registration of
dealers under  the Act	while Section  6 empowers  the State
Government to  exempt from levy of tax any class of dealers,
persons	 or   importers,  subject  to  such  conditions	 and
restrictions as	 may be	 imposed in  that behalf.  Section 7
provides for  punishment in  case of  contravention  of	 the
provisions of  the Act.	 Section 8  says that  the machinery
under the Bihar Finance Act, 1981 shall be the machinery for
assessment and collection of this tax. Section 9 confers the
rule-making power upon the State Government.
</p><p id="p_5">     A number of writ petitions were filed by dealers in the
Patna High  Court questioning the constitutional validity of
the Ordinance/Act.  Several grounds were urged in support of
the said challenge. The High Court has, however, struck down
the Act	 on the	 following grounds:  the State has failed to
place any  material  before  the  Court	 to  show  that	 the
impugned tax is either compensatory or vagulatory in nature;
the levy  must, therefore,  be	held  to  be  impleding	 the
freedom of  trade,  commerce  or  intercourse  guaranted  by
<a href="/doc/121190/" id="a_1">Article 301</a>  of the  Constitution;  the	 State	cannot	also
invoke the  protection of  clause (b) of <a href="/doc/1392920/" id="a_2">Article 304</a> for the
reason that  it	 has  not  established	that  the  said	 tax
constitutes  a	reasonable  restriction	 imposed  in  public
interest within	 the meaning of the said clause though it is
true that the President has assented to the Bill; the entire
Act is	void and  inoperative on  this score. The High Court
has also held that the proviso to Section 3(1) and Section 6
of the	Act are	 void being  violative of  <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_3">Article 14</a> of the
Constitution. It  has held  that both  the  said  provisions
confer	an   unguided  and   uncanalised  power	  upon	 the
Government.  The   High	 Court	 declined  to  consider	 the
submission made by the petitioners based upon the Additional
Duties of  excise (Goods  of Special  Importance) Act,	1957
[hereinafter referred  to as  "A.D.E. Act"]  in view  of the
fact that it had already declared the Act void for violation
of <a href="/doc/121190/" id="a_4">Article 301.</a>
</p><p id="p_6">     The State of Bihar has filed Special Leave Petition (C)
Nos.14636-14644 of  1995  against  the	said  judgment.	 The
I.T.C. Limited,	 one of the writ petitioners before the High
Court, has filed Special Leave Petition (C) No.23172 of 1995
challenging the	 correctness of	 the judgment  of  the	High
Court insofar as it has negatived its contentions concerning
the validity of the Act. Special Leave Petition (C) No.23303
of 1995	 is preferred  by Vazir	 Sultan	 Tobacco  Industries
Limited and another.
</p><p id="p_7">     Sri  M.Chandrasekharans  learned  Additional  Solicitor
Generals  appearing   for  the	State  of  Bihar  urged	 the
following contentions:
</p><p id="p_8">(1) The High Court was in error in holding that the impugned
tax  is	 not  established  either  to  the  compensatory  or
regulatory. In	facts it is both. The Act was enacted by the
Bihar Legislature  to off-sets	atleast partly,	 the loss of
revenue to  the State  resulting from  the decision  of this
Court in  India Cement Limited &amp; Ors. v. State of Tamil Nadu
&amp; Ors.	(1990 (1)  S.C.C.12). The finances of the State will
be spent  on public  welfare and  to carry  out the  welfare
schemes meant  for the	people of Bihar. The entire State of
Bihar is  divided into	local areas  of	 one  or  the  other
category. The  money raised  under the Act will naturally be
spent for  the welfare	of the State which necessarily means
for the benefit of the local areas.
</p><p id="p_9">(2) Even if it is helds for some reason that the levy is not
established to be compensatory or regulatory in nature, even
then the  challenge to the Act cannot succeed because it has
obtained the  assent of	 the President	as  contemplated  by
clause (b)  of <a href="/doc/1392920/" id="a_5">Article	304</a> read  with <a href="/doc/26402/" id="a_6">Article	255</a>  of	 the
Constitution. The  impugned levy  constitutes  a  reasonable
restriction  upon   the	 freedom   of  trade,  commerce	 and
intercourse guaranteed	by <a href="/doc/121190/" id="a_7">Article  301</a>	 imposed  in  public
interest. It  satisfies all  the requirements of clause (b).
Every tax  imposed must be presumed to be in the interest of
the public. Further, the very fact of grant of assent by the
President  as  contemplated  by	 <a href="/doc/191273/" id="a_8">Article  304(b)</a>  read	with
<a href="/doc/26402/" id="a_9">Article 255</a>  gives rise	 to the	 presumption  that  the	 tax
constitutes a  reasonable restriction  conceived  in  public
interest. The High Court was in error in holding otherwise.
(3) The	 impugned judgment insofar as it invalidates Section
3(1) and  Section 6 is contrary to several decisions of this
Court which  have  sustained  similar  provisions.  Where  a
ceiling is  prescribed and  the executive  is  empowered  to
prescribe the  rate of	tax subject to the said ceiling, the
conferment of the power cannot be characterized as unguided,
particularly  where   the  power   is  conferred   upon	 the
Government.  Conferment	  of  power   of  exemption,  as  is
conferred by  Section 6,  has also been upheld by this Court
on the	ground that  the Act  itself provides  the requisite
guidance.
</p><p id="p_10">     Sri S.Ganesh and Sri Pawan Kumar, learned counsel
for  respondents-writ	petitioners,  while   disputing	 the
correctness  of	  the  contentions   urged  by	the  learned
Additional Solicitor  General, urged  the following  further
contentions in support of their challenge to the validity of
the impugned Act:
</p><p id="p_11">(a) The	 A.D.E. Act was enacted by the Parliament to replace
the levy  of sales  tax and all other taxes by the States on
the commodities mentioned in the First Schedule to that Act.
Tobacco i  included in	the First  Schedule. The  State	 of
Bihar has been provided an appropriate share in the revenues
raised under  the A.D.E. Act. It, therefore, follows that so
far as	tobacco is  concerned, the  State  cannot  levy	 any
impost thereon	including entry	 tax. It it does, lt will be
deprived of  its share	in the	revenues  raised  under	 the
A.D.E. Act.  By sharing	 the revenues  under the A.D.E. Acts
the State  of Bihar  must be  presumed to have agreed not to
levy any type of tax or impost on tobacco. The levy of entry
tax under  the impugned	 Act, therefore,  is incompetent and
void. The  report of  the Taxation Enquiry Commission on the
basis of which the said Act was enacted and the practice and
understanding of  the various States at the Center since the
enactment of  the said	Act  clearly  establish	 that  while
sharing She  revenues under  the A.D.E. Act, the States have
agreed not  to impose  any tax, cess or fee on tobacco under
whatever name.	As a  matter of	 fact, entry  tax is  a	 tax
similar to the sales tax.
</p><p id="p_12">(b) The	 impugned Act  does not indicate either expressly or
by necessary implication that the revenues raised thereunder
will be	 utilized for  the purposes of local areas. Entry 52
In List-II  of the  Seventh Schedule to the Constitution has
been understood	 in a particular manner right from 1920. The
entry tax  is a	 substitute for octroi. Octroi was levied by
the local  authorities on  consumption, use or sale of goods
within their  areas. The  revenues so  raised were meant for
the purpose  of such  local authorities.  The  character  of
entry tax  is no different. Even though levied by the State,
it is levied (a) on the entry of goods into a local area for
consumption, use or sale therein and (b) for the purposes of
such local area. Since the impugned Act does not indicate in
any manner  that the  revenues	raised	thereunder  will  be
passed on  to the local authorities for being used for their
own purposes,  the tax	imposed cannot	be treated  as a tax
contemplated by	 Entry 52. For this reason too, the impugned
Act is	beyond	the  legislative  competence  of  the  Bihar
Legislature.
</p><p id="p_13">     Needless to  add that  the learned Additional Solicitor
General disputed the correctness of the above contentions.
</p><p id="p_14">     From the  contentions urged  before us,  the  following
questions arise for consideration:
</p><p id="p_15">(1) Whether  the impugned  tax has  been established  to  be
compensatory in	 nature	 or  whether  it  can  be  called  a
regulatory measure?
</p><p id="p_16">(2) In	case the  impugned tax	is  not	 established  to  be
compensatory - or as a measure of regulation - whether it is
saved by virtue of the provision contained in <a href="/doc/191273/" id="a_10">Article 304(b)</a>
read with  <a href="/doc/26402/" id="a_11">Article 255</a>	of the Constitution. In other words,
</p><p id="p_17">(a) whether the Act has received the assent of the President
as alleged  by the  State, (b)	whether the levy of the said
tax constitutes a reasonable restriction and (c) whether the
said levy is conceived in public interest?
(3)  Whether  the  Bihar  Legislature  is  deprived  of	 its
legislative competence	to enact the impugned Act on account
of the	enactment of  A.D.E. Act and/or because the State of
Bihar is getting a portion of the taxes levied and collected
under the A.D.E. Act.
</p><p id="p_18">(4) Whether the impugned enactment is outside the purview of
Entry  52   in	List-II	 of  the  Seventh  Schedule  to	 the
Constitution  and,   therefore,	  beyond   the	 legislative
competence of  the Bihar  Legislature for the reason that it
does not  provide for  the revenues  raised thereunder to be
passed on  to the  local authorities  for being used for the
purposes of the respective local areas?
</p><p id="p_19">(5) Whether  the proviso  to Section  3(1) and Section 6 are
void for  the reasons  assigned by  the High Court? Question
No. 1:	Whether the  impugned tax has been established to be
compensatory or	 whether it  can be  treated as a regulatory
measure?
</p><p id="p_20">     <a href="/doc/121190/" id="a_12">Article  301</a>   declares  that   subject  to  the  other
provisions in  Part XIII,  trade, commerce  and	 intercourse
throughout the	territory of  India shall  be  free  Certain
exceptions are	provided to  the  said	Rule  by  Part	XIII
itself, one of them being clause (b) of <a href="/doc/1392920/" id="a_13">Article 304.</a>
</p><p id="p_21">     This Court	 has held  that tax laws are not outside the
purview	 of   <a href="/doc/121190/" id="a_14">Article  301</a>   and  that	taxes  which  M	 and
immediately restrict  trade and	 interfere with	 the flow of
trade and  commerce do	offend <a href="/doc/121190/" id="a_15">Article	301</a> Similarly,	non-
fiscal measures	 which have the above effect are equally hit
by <a href="/doc/121190/" id="a_16">Article  301</a> It  has, however, been held by a seven-Judge
Constitution Bench  of this  Court in  Automobile  Transport
(Rajasthan State  of Rajasthan	(1963  (1)  S.C.R.491)	that
"regulatory measures or measures imposing compensatory taxes
for the	 use of	 trading facilities  do not  come within the
purview of  the restrictions contemplated by <a href="/doc/121190/" id="a_17">Article 301</a> and
such measures  need not	 comply with the requirements of the
proviso to  <a href="/doc/191273/" id="a_18">Article 304(b)</a>  of the Constitution." It is held
that regulatory	 measures do  not really  impede the  trade,
commerce or intercourse but rather facilitate it. Similarly,
it is  held that  compensatory taxes  for the use of trading
facilities are outside the purview of <a href="/doc/121190/" id="a_19">Article 301.</a> Since
the impugned  Act is  not a  regulatory measure but a taxing
enactment and the tax is levied upon the entry of goods into
a local area, i.e., upon the movement of goods, the question
is whether  the impugned  tax is  compensatory in nature for
the use of trading facilities provided by the State. One
High Court  has observed that the State has failed is adduce
any material  to establish  the compensatory  nature of	 the
tax. The only averment in the counter-affidavit filed in the
High Court  is the  following one Counter affidavit filed by
Sri Binoy Krishan, Deputy Commissioner, Commercial
Taxes, Bihar]:	"the Entry  Tax Ordinance  was thought to be
promulgated in	view of	 the loss  of revenue on cess due to
the decision  rendered by  the Hon'ble	Supreme Court in the
case of	 India Cement Ltd. reported in A.I.R. 1990 S.C.85 as
well as	 several decisions  of the  Hon'ble Patna High Court
following the  decision". The  learned Additional  Solicitor
General however	 contended that	 the following	indisputable
facts do establish the compensatory nature of the taxes viz.
the entire State of Bihar is divided into local areas of one
or the	other kind  and that  the Government  and the  local
authorities do provide several trading facilities to promote
trade and  commerce with and within the State in the form of
laying	and   maintenance  of	roads,	 establishment	 and
maintenance  of	 markets,  establishment  and  operation  of
market yards  for agricultural	commodities and	 a  host  of
other facilities.  He submitted	 that the impugned tax. will
naturally help	in  providing  t  he  above  facilities	 and
therefore, it  must he held to be compensatory. He requested
us to  take notice of these undeniable facts and to hold, on
that basis,  that the  impugned	 tax  is  compensatory.	 The
learned Additional  Solicitor General further submitted that
when the  entire State	is divided  into local areas when no
part of the State is left uncovered by a local area and when
the impugned  tax is  levied for  the purposes	of the State
including the  welfare schemes	being undertaken  by it, the
tax cannot  but be  compensatory in nature. The impugned tax
will help  the State  in providing and improving the trading
facilities since the interest of the State lies in promoting
trade and  commerce in goods and commodities with and within
the State  of Bihar.  Reliance is  placed upon the following
observations at Page 549 of Automobile Transport (Rajasthan)
Limited, which read:
</p><p id="p_22">     "Licensing	      system	    with
     compensatory-  fees  would	 not  be
     restrictions     but     regulatory
     provisions;  for  without	it,  the
     necessary lines  of  communications
     such as  roads, water-ways and air-
</p><p id="p_23">     ways    cannot    effectively    be
     maintained and the freedom declared
     may in  practice turn  out to be an
     empty  one.   So  too,  regulations
     providing for necessary services to
     enable   the   free   movement   of
     traffic, whether  charged	or  not,
     cannot   also   be	  described   as
     restrictions impeding the freedom."
</p><p id="p_24">     It	 is   not  possible   to  deny	the  force  of	this
submission. Where  the local  areas contemplated  by the Act
cover the  entire States  the distinction  between the State
and the	 local areas  practically disappears. [The situation
would, no  doubts  be  different  if  the  local  areas	 are
confined to  a few cities or towns in the State and the levy
is upon	 the entry  of goods  into those  local areas alone.
This is	 an important  distinction which  should be  kept in
mind while appreciating this aspect and also while examining
the  decisions	 of  this  Court  rendered  in	fifties	 and
sixties'.]   The facilities  provided in  the State  are the
facilities provided in the local areas as well. Interests of
the State and the interests of the local authorities are, in
essence, no different. It is not and it cannot be stipulated
that  for  the	purpose	 of  establishing  the	compensatory
character of  the tax,	it is  necessary to  establish	that
every rupee  collected on account of the entry tax should be
shown to be spent on providing the trading facilities. It is
enough if some connection is established between the tax and
the trading  facilities provided.  The connection  can be  a
direct one  or an  indirect one,  as held  by this  Court in
<a href="/doc/68803088/" id="a_20">Bhagatram Rajeev  Kumar v. Commissioner of Sales Tax, Madhya
Pradesh</a> [(1995)	 96 S.T.C 654]. "The concept of compensatory
nature of  tax has  been widened and if there is substantial
or even	 some  link  between  the  tax	and  the  facilities
extended to  such dealers,  directly or indirectly, the levy
cannot be  impugned as	invalid". Though  not stated  in the
counter-affidavit, we  can take	 notice of the fact that the
State does provide several facilities to the trade including
laying and  maintenance of  roads, water-ways  and  markets,
etc. As a matter of fact, since the levy is by the State, we
must also  look to  the facilities provided by the State for
ascertaining  whether	the  State   has   established	 the
compensatory character of the tax. On this basis, it must be
held that the State has established that the impugned tax is
compensatory in nature. This finding is by itself sufficient
to negative  the attack	 based on <a href="/doc/121190/" id="a_21">Article 301</a> but even if we
assume that  the State	has not	 established the  said fact,
even so the result is no different. We proceed to elaborate.
Question No.2:	In case	 the impugned tax is not established
to be compensatory - or as a measure of regulation - whether
it is  saved by virtue of the provision contained in <a href="/doc/191273/" id="a_22">Article
304(b)</a> read  with <a href="/doc/26402/" id="a_23">Article  255</a> of the Constitution. In other
words, (a)  whether the	 Act has  received the assent of the
President as  alleged by  the State, (b) whether the levy of
the said  tax constitutes  a reasonable	 restriction and (c)
whether the said levy is conceived in public interest?
</p><p id="p_25">     The impugned  tax is  a tax  on entry  - on movement of
goods into  a local  area. If  it is  assumed to  be neither
compensatory, nor regulatory, [as mentioned above] it may be
said to	 be offending  <a href="/doc/121190/" id="a_24">Article 301</a>, unless, of course, it is
saved by virtue of the provision contained in <a href="/doc/191273/" id="a_25">Article 304(b)</a>
read with  <a href="/doc/26402/" id="a_26">Article 255</a>	of the Constitution, as contended by

</p><p id="p_34">For, the  exception in	<a href="/doc/191273/" id="a_31">Article 304(b)</a> to come to the rescue
of the State, three requirements have to be satisfied, viz.,
</p><p id="p_35">(a) that the Bill was introduced or moved in the Legislature

impugned tax  constitutes a  reasonable restriction  and (c)
that the  said reasonable  restriction is required in public

</p><p id="p_36">     In this  case, the	 Bill was not introduced or moved in
the Assembly  with the previous sanction of the President as
required by  <a href="/doc/191273/" id="a_34">Article 304(b)</a>  but the contention of the State
is that	 the Bill  has been assented to by the President and
hence, the  requirement is  satisfied. The  writ petitioners
deny the same. They point out that the impugned Act does not
recite the  said fact.	It cannot,  however, be said that in
the absence  of	 such  recital,	 the  said  fact  cannot  be
established aliunde. In support of its contention, the State
relies upon  Para 11  of the supplementary counter-affidavit
filed in  the High Court and upon the telegram sent from Sri
M.L.Gupta, Director  (Home), New  Delhi bearing No.17/36/93-
JUDL.  dated   22.8.1993  addressed   to   Sri	 P.S.Cheema,
Commissioner and  Secretary  to	 the  Governor,	 Bihar,	 Raj
Bhawan, Patna.	Para 11 of the counter-affidavit reads: "11.
That thereafter	 the Bill was introduced in the Assembly and
it was	passed	on  getting  assent  communication  on	22nd
August, 1993 and same was published in Bihar Gazette on 22nd

to the	contrary, we  accept the  averment of  the State and
hold  that   the  requirement  of  prior  consent  has	been
satisfied in the case of the impugned Act.
</p><p id="p_37">     The  next	 question  is	whether	 the   impugned	 tax
constitutes a  reasonable  restriction	and  whether  it  is
imposed in  public interest? In other words, the question is
whether the  interference with	and the restriction upon the
freedom guaranteed  by	<a href="/doc/121190/" id="a_35">Article	 301</a>  in  the  form  of	 the
impugned tax  is a reasonable one and whether it is required
in public interest. The learned Additional Solicitor General
says that both the requirements are satisfied in this case.
He says	 that in view of the sudden loss of revenue from the
cess upon minerals as a result of the judgment of this Court
in India  Cement Limited  and other  judgments of  the Patna
High Court  following it, public interest required the State
to find	 alternative sources  of revenue to keep its various
welfare programmes  and other  governmental functions  going
and that  the impugned	tax was	 conceived  as	one  of	 the
alternate sources.  He relies  upon  the  statement  in	 the
counter-affidavit of  Sri Binoy	 Krishan, filed on behalf of
the State,  referred to	 hereinbefore,	in  support  of	 his
submissions. He	 also relies  upon the	Objects and  Reasons
appended to the Bill, which are to the following effect:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">     "To  collect   funds  for	 various
     public  welfare   schemes	and   to
     implement	   various     financial
     recommendations   of    the   State
     Government, taxation  according  to
     the existing financial condition is
     highly essential.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">     With a  view to  fulfil  the  above
     object and	 to make  the provisions
     of	 the   Bihar  Finance  Act  more
     workable, it  is essential that tax
     is levied	and collected on certain
     goods entering  the local	areas of
     the State	for consumption,  use or
     sale; Bihar  tax on  Entry of Goods
     into Local	 Areas for  Consumption,
     Use   or	 Sale	therein	  Second
     Ordinance, 1993 (Bihar Ordinance 19
     of	 1993)	 has  been   promulgated
     incorporating     the     aforesaid
     provisions.</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">     The Object	 of this  Bill is to get
     the  essential  provisions	 of  the
     Bihar Tax	on Entry  of Goods  into
     Local Areas for Consumption, Use or
     Sale   therein    Ordinance,   1993
     substituted  by   an  Act	 of  the
     Legislature."</blockquote>
<p id="p_38">     On the  basis of  the Statement of Objects and Reasons,
the learned  Additional Solicitor  General contends that the
levy of	 impugned tax  was found  "essential" to raise funds
for various  public welfare  schemes, to  implement  various
financial recommendations  of the  State Government  and  to
make the Bihar Sales Tax Law more effective. It is suggested
that public interest demanded that alternate and new sources
be found  for raising  the money  to meet  the needs  of the
State and  that, therefore,  the levy  was "required" in the
public interest.  The learned  Additional Solicitor  General
relies upon  the following  holding in <a href="/doc/352229/" id="a_36">State of Karnataka v.
M/s.Hansa Corporation</a> (1981 (1) S.C.R.823 at 843):
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_4">     "....... a levy which appears to be
     quite reasonable  in its  impact on
     the  movement   of	 goods	 and  is
     imposed   for    the   purpose   of
     augmenting municipal finances which
     suffered  a   dent	 on  account  of
     abolition of  octroi cannot be said
     to	   impose     an    unreasonable
     restriction  on   the  freedom   of
     inter-State  trade,   commerce  and
     intercourse. In this connection, it
     would  be	 useful	 to  recall  the
     observations  of	this  Court   in
     Khyerbari Tea Co. Ltd-case that the
     power conferred  on this  Court  to
     strike down  a taxing statute if it
     contravenes the provisions of Arts.
     14,19 or  301 has	to be  exercised
     with  circumspection,   bearing  in
     mind that the power of the State to
     levy  taxes   for	the  purpose  of
     governance and for carrying out its
     welfare activities	 is a  necessary
     attribute	of  sovereignty	 and  in
     that  sense   it  is   a  power  of
     paramount	 character.    It    is,
     therefore, idle to contend that the
     levy   imposed    an   unreasonable
     restriction on the freedom of trade
     and commerce."</blockquote>
<p id="p_39">     The above	observation is	relied upon to show not only
that the  impugned tax was "required" in the public interest
but  that   it	is   also  reasonable.	To  demonstrate	 the
reasonable  character	of  levy,   the	 learned  Additional
Solicitor General  relies upon	a few more circumstances. He
points out that so far as motor vehicles, India-made foreign
liquor, vegetable and hydrogenated oil and cements [Items 1,
3, 4  and 5  in the  Schedule to the Act] are concerned, the
entry tax  levied and  collected  thereon  is  given  credit
towards the sales tax payable on the sale of the said goods,
which means  that no  additional burden	 is created  on	 the
dealers by  the impugned  levy. It is pointed out that entry
tax is	levied and  collected mainly from the dealers in the
said goods/commodities	and that  a dealer  brings the	said
goods into  a local  area only for the purpose of sale. Such
sale attracts sales tax which is levied at a far higher rate
than the  entry tax. Once the entry tax paid in respect of a
commodity/goods is given credit towards the sales tax, there
is in  effect no  levy of entry tax on these goods. Thus, no
extra burden is cast by the impugned Act insofar as four out
of six	commodities mentioned in its Schedule are concerned.
These facts  are not  disputed by  anyone before us. No such
credit is,  of course,	given in  respect of  crude oil	 and
tobacco products, which means that, in effect, the entry tax
is being  levied only  upon two	 commodities, viz.,  tobacco
productions and crude oil. But there is a good reason,	says
the learned  Additional Solicitor General, for not providing
for such credit in the case of the said two commodities. The
reason given  for not  making a	 similar  provision  [giving
credit] in the case of tobacco products is that no sales tax
is levied  on tobacco  products by the State of Bihar. Since
no sales  tax is levied on the sale of tobacco products, the
question of giving credit to the entry tax against the sales
tax does  not arise,  says the Additional Solicitor General.
This, no  doubt, means	that so	 far as tobacco products are
concerned, there  is an	 additional levy of three percent by
virtue of the impugned Act and to that extent it may be said
to impede the freedom guaranteed by <a href="/doc/121190/" id="a_37">Article 301.</a> The learned
Additional Solicitor General, however, submits that the levy
represents  a	reasonable  restriction	  because   of	 the
negligible additional  burden it creates and also because of
the inherent  harmful nature of tobacco products. [It may be
remembered that	 the nature  of the  activity is relevant in
the matter  of judging the reasonableness of the restriction
imposed a  well-settled proposition  under  <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_38">Article  19</a>	 and
which proposition is equally relevant under <a href="/doc/191273/" id="a_39">Article 304(b).]</a>
We are	inclined to  agree with the submission. It is stated
by Sri	S.Ganesh, learned counsel for the I.T.C., who is the
main party said to have been affected by this levy, that the
percentage cf  excise duties  on tobacco products [duties of
excise levied  under the  Central Excise  and <a href="/doc/53524/" id="a_40">Salt Act</a>, 1944
and the	 A.D.E. Act  read with	notifications issued in that
behalf] is between 250 to 300 percent of their value. Can it
be said	 that an addition of three percent to the said level
of taxation  is unreasonable  when the	tax  so	 levied	 and
collected is  going to	serve the  interest of the public in
that  State?  Can  it  be  reasonably  suggested  that	this
addition of three percent is impeding the trade, commerce or
intercourse in	tobacco products directly and immediately or
to any appreciable degree? We think not. In this connections
it is  not irrelevant to take into consideration the harmful
nature of  the tobacco products. Though it may not have been
recognized in  1957 when  A.D.E. Act  was enacted, it is now
recognized by  one and	all that  tobacco  is  injurious  to
health. [R  warning  to	 the  above  effect  is	 statutorily
required to be printed on all packets and cartons containing
the tobacco  products.]	 The  extraordinary  high  level  of
excise duties  on tobacco  is meant  precisely to discourage
its consumption.  In  our  opinions  therefore,	 it  is	 not
possible to say that the addition of three percent is either
an unreasonable	 restriction on	 the freedom  of  trade	 and
commerce or that it is not required in public interest.
</p><p id="p_40">     In this  connections it  is necessary  to notice  a few
decisions brought  to our notice. In Bhagatram Rajeev Kumar,
a three-Judge  Bench of this Court has rejected the argument
that to	 be compensatory  the tax must facilitate the trade.
The reason  is obvious:	 if a measure facilitates the trade,
it would  not be a restriction on trade but an encouragement
to it. lt was observed:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_5">     "The submission  of Shri Ashok Sen,
     learned   Senior	 Counsel,   that
     compensation    is	   that	   which
     facilitates the trade only does not
     appear to	be sound. The concept of
     compensatory nature of tax has been
     widened and if there is substantial
     or even  s me  link between the tax
     and the facilities extended to such
     dealers Directly  or indirectly the
     levy cannot be impugned is invalid.
     The stand	of the	State  that  the
     revenue earned  is being  made over
     to the  local bodies  to compensate
     them for the loss caused, makes the
     impost compensatory  in nature,  as
     augmentation of their finance would
     enable them  to  provide  municipal
     services  more  efficiently,  which
     would help	 or  ease  free-flow  of
     trade  and	  commerce,  because  of
     which the impost has to be regarded
     as compensatory  in nature, in view
     of what  has  been	 stated	 in  the
     aforesaid	    decisions,	    more
     particularly in Hansa Corporation's
     case [1981] 1 SCR 823 : AIR 1981 SC
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_6">     463."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_7">		     [Emphasis supplied]
     In Shakti	Kumar M.Sancheti  v.  State  of	 Maharashtra
[(1995) 96 S.T.C.659], the very same Bench has opined:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_8">     "A very  perusal of  these	 objects
     and  reasons  would  indicate  that
     this  legislation	was  brought  in
     order to compensate loss of revenue
     by consumers  who avoid  payment of
     the sales	tax or	purchase tax  on
     the vehicle payable in the State by
     purchasing	 it   in  another  State
     where the	rate was lesser than the
     State of  Maharshtra  and	then  to
     bring the vehicle inside the State.
     The legislature, therefore, clearly
     intended  to   avoid  any	loss  of
     legitimate sales tax revenue by the
     State. But	 the levy cannot be held
     to be  bad because	 the Legislature
     intended to avoid any loss of sales
     tax in  the State	so long as it is
     not found	to be invalid because of
     any  constitutional   or  statutory
     violation. It  is not the intention
     or propriety  of a	 legislation but
     it is  legality or illegality which
     renders it valid or invalid."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_9">Both these  decisions deal  with entry	tax levied by Madhya
Pradesh and Maharshtra States respectively.</blockquote>
<p id="p_41">     Now, coming to the crude oil (Indian Oil Corporation is
also a	party before  us), it  is explained  by the  learned
Additional Solicitor  General that  inasmuch as	 there is no
sale of	 crude in the State of Bihar, a provision for giving
credit of  entry tax  against sales  tax was  thought to  be
unnecessary. It	 is explained  that the	 crude from  the oil
fields in  Assam is  pumped to Barauni Oil Refinery, located
in Bihar,  through a pipeline. The crude is refined here and
petroleum and other products produced therefrom are sold. It
is, therefore,	submitted that	while an entry tax is levied
on the entry of crude in a local area, no provision has been
made for giving credit/set-off of such tax against the sales
tax payable  inasmuch as  no crude is ever sold in Bihar and
no tax is levied or collected thereon, as a fact.
</p><p id="p_42">     Reliance is  placed by the learned Additional Solicitor
General upon  the decision  of	the  Constitution  Bench  in
<a href="/doc/668225/" id="a_41">Khyerbari Tea  Company Ltd.  v. State  of  Assam</a>  (1964	 (5)
S.C.R.975) where it has been recognized that a tax levied by
the State  must be  presumed to	 be a reasonable restriction
inasmuch as  taxes are	levied to  raise money	in order  to
carry on  the functions of the Government and to sustain the
manifold activities  undertaken by  it. This  decision	also
points out  that the fact that President has given assent to
the Bill  also	raises	a  presumption	that  the  President
[Central Government] had applied his mind to the problem and
had come to the conclusion that the proposed tax constitutes
a reasonable  restriction and  is required  to be imposed in
public interest. It is true that these are only presumptions
but taken  together with  other materials referred to above,
they do	 firmly establish  the said  requirement in  <a href="/doc/191273/" id="a_42">Article
304(b).</a> The learned Additional Solicitor General also relied
upon the following holding in Hansa Corporation:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_10">     "The next	is whether  this levy is
     in public	interest.  As  has  been
     pointed out  earlier, the	levy was
     to compensate  the loss suffered by
     abolition	of  octroi.  These  very
     people were paying octroi without a
     demur. After removing the obnoxious
     features of  octroi a  very  modest
     impost is	levied on entry of goods
     in a  local area  and that	 too not
     for further  augmenting finances of
     the    municipalities    but    for
     compensating the  loss suffered  by
     the   abolition   of   octroi,   is
     certainly	 a    levy   in	  public
     interest. As  has	been  repeatedly
     observed by  this, Courts the taxes
     generally are  imposed for	 raising
     public    revenue	   for	  better
     governance of  the country	 and for
     carrying out  welfare activities of
     our welfare  State envisaged in the
     Constitution and,	therefore,  even
     if a  tax to some extent imposes an
     economic impediment to the activity
     taxed,  that   by	itself	 is  not
     sufficient either to stigmatize the
     levy  as  unreasonable  or	 not  in

<p id="p_43">     Sri Ganesh,  learned counsel for the I.T.C., points out
that in	 Khyerbari Tea	Co Ltd., this Court did not rest its
decision merely	 upon the  presumptions	 aforementioned	 and
that as	 a fact,  specific material  was produced before the
Courts by  the States  that the funds in question were being
utilized for  keeping the  roads in order and in maintaining
the water-ways	in the	State.	 The statement	filed by the
State in  that	case  did  establish  that  the	 expenditure
incurred by  it in  maintaining the water-ways was more than
the revenue received from the carriage tax. It is because of
the said material, Sri Ganesh say, that the levy was held to
be a  reasonable  restriction.	It  is	true  that  no	such
specific statement  is contained in the counter affidavit of
the State  in the  cases before us but this  circumstance is
of no consequence herein for the reason that on the material
brought to  the notice	of the	Court and  for	the  reasons
recorded hereinabove,  the requirements	 of  <a href="/doc/191273/" id="a_43">Article  304(b)</a>
must be held to have been satisfied in this case. The attack
upon the  validity of  the impugned  Act on  the  ground  of
violation of <a href="/doc/121190/" id="a_44">Article 301</a> accordingly fails.
Question No.3:	Whether the Bihar Legislature is deprived of
its legislative	 competence to	enact the  impugned  Act  on
account of  the enact of A.D.E. Act and/or because the State
of Bihar  is getting  a portion	 of  the  taxes	 levied	 and
collected under the A.D.E. Act?
</p><p id="p_44">     The submission  of Sri  Ganesh on this count runs thus:
the A.D.E.  Act was enacted by Parliament in lieu of levy of
sales tax  and all  other taxes and imposts by the States on
tobacco	 and   other  commodities  mentioned  in  the  First
Schedule thereto.  <a href="/doc/53524/" id="a_45">This Act</a>  was enacted  by the  Parliament
based on an understanding with the States that they will not
levy sale  or purchase	tax or any other kind of impost upon
the scheduled  commodities and	that the  Union will collect
additional duties  of excise  under the	 Act and make over a
portion of  the same  in specified proportion to the several
States in  the Country.	 The Report  of the Taxation Enquiry
Commission [1953-54] is the basis of this Act. The Report of
the Taxation  Enquiry  Commission  states  inter  alia	that
various duties	imposed [by certain States] upon tobacco are
casting an  unduly heavy  burden on  tobacco and  on tobacco
manufactures and  that there  is need  "for ensuring  proper
coordination between  the taxes	 on tobacco  levied  by	 the
Central Governments  the States	 and the local authorities".
For this  purpose, the report stated: "We consider that such
coordination would  be best evolved through the machinery of
the inter-State	 Taxation Council  to which  we have already
alluded" [Para	23 at  Page 136 of the Report]. At a meeting
of the	National Development Council held in December, 1976,
the Center and all the States agreed unanimously that "sales
tax  levied   in  States   on  mill-made  textiles,  tobacco
including manufactured	tobacco and sugar should be replaced
by surcharge on the central excise duties on these articles,
the income  derived therefrom being distributed among States
on the	basis of  consumption, subject	to the	then  income
derived by  States being  assured".  Pursuant  to  the	said
agreement and  the decision to levy additional excise duties
on three  commodities including	 tobacco, the Second Finance
Commission was requested to recommend a suitable basis
for distribution  of the  proceeds of  the additional excise
duties among  the States  and  the  Union  Territories.	 The
Second	Finance	 Commission  made  a  thorough	enquiry	 and
submitted  its	 proposals.  On	 the  basis  of	 the  N.D.C.
resolution and the recommendations of the Second Finance
Commissions the	 A.D.E. Act was enacted. On the basis of the
above materials	 Sri Ganesh  submits that the A.D.E. Act was
intended to  prevent the  levy of  all forms of taxes on the
goods mentioned in the Schedule thereto and that
this understanding  was adhered	 to, respected	and followed
all these  years by  all the  States. Pursuant	to the	said
understanding, he  says, certain States which had levied one
or the	other form  of impost  on tobacco withdrew the same.
The decision of this Court in <a href="/doc/1225724/" id="a_46">A.B.Abdul Qadir &amp; Ors.v. State
of Kerala</a> [1976 (2) S.C.R.690], he says, refers to
the fact  that the State of Kerala has withdrawn the licence
fee on	tobacco after  the coming  into force  of the A.D.E.
Act. The  learned counsel  places  strong  reliance  upon  a
letter dated May 4, 1957 from the then Finance Minister, Sri
T.T.Krishnamachary, addressed to the Chief Ministers of
the States  stating, inter  alia, that	"it is	proposed  to
correlate the principles of distribution to the existence of
a complete  exemption from  sales tax or purchase tax or any
other impost  by whatever  name called	on these commodities
under the  respective State  laws. In other words, the State
which does not exempt completely all these three commodities
from its sales tax Act or any other similar legislation will
not be	entitled to  partake  in  the  distribution  of	 the
proceeds of  the additional  excise duty".  Learned  counsel
points out  that Bihar has been receiving its due share from
the additional	duties of  excise collected by the Center on
the  basis  of	the  recommendations  made  by	the  Finance
Commissions from time to time. Indeed, he goes to the extent
of submitting that the entry tax contemplated by Entry 52 in
List-II of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution is a tax
similar to sales tax inasmuch as it is a tax levied upon the
entry of  goods into  a	 local	area  for  the	purposes  of
consumptions use or sale therein.
</p><p id="p_45">     It is  not possible to agree with Sri Ganesh. Entry tax
is a  tax levied at the point of entry of goods into a local
area for the purpose of consumption, use or sale therein. It
is not a tax on sale. It is a tax on the entry of goods into
a local	 area and  it is  precisely because of this that the
petitioners say,  <a href="/doc/121190/" id="a_47">Article 301</a>  is attracted. They cannot, at
the same time, say that it is not a tax on entry but a
tax in	the nature  of a  tax on sale* - apart from the fact
that such a contention is wholly misconceived. Taxes on sale
and purchase  of goods	are provided  by Entry 52 in List-II
Moreover, Entry	 52 has	 been the  subject-matter of several
decisions of this Court which say that the tax is
upon the  entry of goods into a local areas i.e., upon entry
of goods for the purpose of consumptions use or sale
____________________________________________________________
*If it is a tax on sale, <a href="/doc/121190/" id="a_48">Article 301</a> is not attracted.
therein. Neither  mere entry  of goods	is enough to attract
the levy  nor the  mere sale  thereof within the local area.
What attracts  the  levy  under	 Entry	52  [and  under	 the
impugned enactment]  is the  entry of  goods into local area
for consumption	 or for	 use or	 for sale  within that local
area for the purpose of consumption or use within that local
area. Indeed,  when it	was contended  by one of the States,
State of  Karnataka, that the expression "sale" occurring in
Entry 52  should be  given, its	 full and normal meaning and
should not  be confined to sale of goods in a local area for
consumption or	use therein,  the contention was rejected by
this Court  with reference  to the earlier decisions of this
Court  [<a href="/doc/435086/" id="a_49">See  Entry  Tax	 Officer,  Bangalore  v.  Chandanmal
Champalal</a> [1994	 (4) S.C.C.463]. The said decision refers to
and follows  the earlier  decisions of	this  Court  on	 the
point. Secondly,  it is	 abundantly clear from the materials
which we  shall presently  refer to, that the A.D.E. Act was
meant as  a substitute for the taxes on the sale or purchase
of scheduled  commodities alone	 and not  for all  kinds  of
taxes, cesses  and fees	 which the  States are	entitled  to
impose by  virtue of  the entries  in List-II  or  for	that
matter List-III of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution.
The statement  of Objects  and Reasons	appended to the Bill
reads thus:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_11">     "The  object  of  the  Bill  is  to
     impose additional	duties of excise
     in - replacement of the sales taxes
     levied by	the Union  and States on
     sugar,   tobacco	 and   mill-made
     textiles and  to distribute the net
     proceeds  attributable   to   Union
     Territories,  to  the  States.  The
     distribution of the proceeds of the
     additional duties	broadly	 follows
     the  pattern   recommended	 by  the
     Second	Finance	     Commission.
     Provision has  been made  that  the
     States which levy a tax on the sale
     or purchase  of  these  commodities
     after the	1st April,  1958 do  not
     participate in  the distribution of
     the net  proceeds.	   Provision  is
     also being	 made in  the  Bill  for
     including these  three goods in the
     category of goods declared to be of
     special importance	 in  inter-State
     trade   or	   commerce   so   that,
     following the imposition of uniform
     duties of	excise	on    them,  the
     rates of sales tax if levied by any
     State are	subject from  1st April,
     1958 to the restrictions in <a href="/doc/1116546/" id="a_50">Section
     15</a> of  the Central	 Sales Tax  Act,
     1956."</blockquote>
<p id="p_46">     <a href="/doc/1816198/" id="a_51">Section  3</a>	  provides  for	  levy	and   collection  of
additional duties.  <a href="/doc/1036952/" id="a_52">Section 4</a>  provides for  distribution of
additional duties among the States. It says that during each
financial years	 there shall be paid out of the Consolidated
Fund of	 India to  the	States,	 in    accordance  with	 the
provisions of the Second Schedules such sums, representing a
part of the net proceeds of the additional duties levied and
collected during  that	 financial year, as are specified in
the Schedule.  <a href="/doc/256155/" id="a_53">Section 5</a>  says that any expenditure incurred
under the  Act shall  be charged to the Consolidated fund of
India. <a href="/doc/331124/" id="a_54">Section	6</a> confers  the rule-making  power  upon	 the
Central Government.  The proviso  to Rule  (2) in the Second
Schedule to the Act is of crucial relevance to us. Rule
(2) along with its proviso reads thus:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_12">     "During each of the financial years
     commencing on and after the Ist day
     of April,	1974 there shall be paid
     to each of	 the States specified in
     column 1  of the  Table below  such
     percentage	 of   the  net	proceeds
     after  deducting  therefrom  a  sum
     equal to  1.41 per cent of the said
     proceeds as  being	 attributable to
     Union Territories,	 as is	set  out
     against it in column 2.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_13">	  Provided  but	 if  during  the
     financial year  there is levied and
     collected in any State a tax on the
     sale or purchase of sugar, tobacco,
     cotton  fabrics.  woollen	fabrics.
     rayon or artificial silk fabrics or
     one or more of them by or under any
     law of that States no sums shall be
     payable to	 that State  under  this
     paragraph	in   respect   of   that
     financial year  unless the	 Central
     Government	 by	 special   order
     otherwise directs."</blockquote>
<p id="p_47">     The proviso  states that  if during  a given  financial
years a	 State levies  and collects  a tax  on the  sale  or
purchase of  scheduled goods  or on  any one  or more of the
scheduled goods	 by or	under a	 law of	 that States no sums
shall be  payable to  that state  under	 this  paragraph  in
respect	 of   that  financial	year,  unless	the  Central
Government by  special order  directs otherwise. There is no
reference in  the Act  or in  the Statement  of Objects	 and
Reasons to  any tax  other than the tax on sale or  purchase
of goods.  There is  no ambiguity  in the  language  of	 the
proviso to Rule (2), which is a part of the statute.
</p><p id="p_48">     The A.D.E.	 Act  is  enacted  by  the  Parliament	with
reference to  Entry 84	in List-I of the Seventh Schedule to
the Constitution  whereas the  impugned enactment is made by
the State  with reference  to Entry 52 in List-Il. The power
to levy taxes on sale or purchase of goods is conferred upon
the States  and the States alone by Entry 52 in List II. The
Parliament cannot  make a law either with reference to Entry
52 or for that matter with reference to Entry 54. The A.D.E.
Act is	also not  a law	 made under  and with  reference  to
<a href="/doc/667558/" id="a_55">Article 252</a>  of the  Constitution, which  article powers the
Parliament  to	make  a	 law  with  respect  to	 any  matter
mentioned  in	List-  II,   if	 two  or  more	States	pass
resolutions requesting	the Parliament to make a law in that
behalf. The impugned Act is also not relatable to any of the
Articles 249 to 253 which are in the nature of exceptions to
the normal rule that Parliament can make no law with respect
to the	entries in List-II. If so, it follows that the State
legislatures are  not denuded  or deprived of their power to
make a	law either  with  reference  to	 Entry	52  or	with
reference  to  Entry  54  in  List-II.	That  power  remains
untouched and  unaffected. All	that the Parliament has said
by enacting  the A.D.E.	 Act is that it will levy additional
duties of excise and distribute a part of the proceeds among
the State  provided the	 States do not levy taxes on sale or
purchase of  the scheduled  commodities. The  Parliament has
also provided  the consequence	that follows  if  any  State
levies tax on sale or purchase of scheduled commodities; all
that happens is that the State will be deprived of its share
in the	proceeds af  additional duties	of excise  for	that
financial year.	 Even this  is subject	to the	power of the
Central Government to direct otherwise. The Parliament could
not, and  did not, prohibit any State from making any law or
levying any  tax which	a State	 can levy  by virtue  of the
entries in  List-II. The  decision of this Court in <a href="/doc/408898/" id="a_56">State of
Kerala v.  M/s.Attesee [Agro  Industrial Corporation</a>]  (1989
Suppl.(1) S.C.C.733) does bear out our understanding.
At Page 744, this Court observed:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_14">     "The 1957 Act also has a bearing on
     the sales	tax  levy  of	 various
     States. By	 levying sales tax on an
     item covered by the schedule to the
     1957 Act,	the State  will have  to
     forego its share on distribution of
     the  proceeds   of	 the  additional
     excise  duty   levied.  Whether  it
     should impose  sales tax on an item
     of declared  goods, limited  by the
     restrictions in  <a href="/doc/1116546/" id="a_57">Section 15</a>  pf the
     <a href="/doc/1645178/" id="a_58">CST Act</a> and at the risk of losing a
     share in the additional excise duty
     levied in	respect of   those  very
     items,  is	  for	the   State   to
     determine. As  Pointed out	 by  Sri
     Poti, it  was open	 to  the  Kerala
     Legislature to  decide - and it did
     so also  - that on some items there
     should  be	 one  or  other	 of  the
     levies  or	 both  of  them	 and  to
     modify these  levies depending upon
     its financial exigencies. But these
     factual or periodical variations do
     not detract  from the basic reality
     that the  policy of  sales tax levy
     on declared  goods has  to keep  in
     view, and	be  influenced	by,  the
     provisions of  the <a href="/doc/1645178/" id="a_59">CST  Act</a> and the
     1957 Act."</blockquote>
<p id="p_49">     To the  same effect is the decision of a Division Bench
of the	Madras High  Court in  <a href="/doc/1156141/" id="a_60">Nemichand Parasmal  &amp; Co.  v.
Deputy Commercial  Tax Officer,	 Evening  Bazaar  Assessment
Circle, Madras</a>	[(1984) 55  S.T.C.47] where  this aspect has
been elaborately  dealt with.  We agree with their reasoning
on this score.
</p><p id="p_50">     We are  also of  the opinion  that	 the  scope  of	 the
A.D.E. Act cannot be extended by reference to anterior
reports or correspondence between the Center and the States,
as the	case may  be, apart  from the fact that the material
referred to  is not unambiguous. Para 32 at  Page 126 of the
Taxation Enquiry  Commission [1953-54], the relevant portion
whereof we  have extracted  hereinbefore,  is  more  in	 the
nature of a statement of fact coupled with a recommendation.
All that  it says  is that  the States	had imposed  several
duties and  other imports upon tobacco which were casting an
unduly heavy  burden upon  it  and  that,  therefore,  there
should be  coordination between	 different taxes  on tobacco
levied	 by the Central Government, the States and the local
authorities. For  that purpose,	 the Commission	 recommended
the  constitution   of	an   Inter-State  Taxation  Council.
Admittedly, no	such  Council  has  ever  been	constituted.
Similarly, the	letter of  the then  finance  Minister,	 Sri
T.T.Krishnamachary, relied upon by Sri Ganesh, which we have
set out	 hereinabove, is  also not  quite clear. The extract
speaks, in the first instance, of "a complete exemption from
sales tax  or purchase	tax or any other impost	 by whatever
name called  on these commodities under the respective State
laws" but  then it  immediately proceeds to explain, what it
means by  the said expression, by saying, "(I)n other words,
the State which does not exempt completely all these three a
commodities from  its sales  tax Act  or any  other  similar
legislation  will   not	 be   entitled	to  partake  in	 the
distribution  of  the  proceeds	 of  the  additional  excise
duties". Again, the fact that subsequent to the A.D.E. fact,
certain States	withdrew certain  enactments   providing for
levy of	 taxes/fees other  than sales  tax on  the scheduled
commodities, in the light of the enactment of the A.D.E. Act
assuming that  it was  for that reason alone is not relevant
on the	meaning and  interpretation of the A.D.E. Act or for
that matters  the proviso to Rule (2) in the Second Schedule
thereto. So  long as  the language of the enactment is clear
and unambiguous,  it is not permissible to refer to the kind
of  material   relied  upon  by	 Sri  Ganesh  for  altering,
expanding  or	modifying  the	 meaning  or  scope  of	 the
provisions of the Act. We ares therefore, unable to say that
by  agreeing  to  take	a  share  in  the  proceeds  of	 the
additional duties  of excise, he State of Bihar has deprived
itself of its power to levy entry tax under and by virtue of
Entry  52   in	List-lI	 in  the  Seventh  Schedule  to	 the
Constitution. Indeed,  it has not even forsaken its power to
levy taxes  on sale  or purchase  of tobacco  or  any  other
scheduled commodity; if it does so, all that would happen is
that the  consequence provided in the proviso to Rule (2) in
the Schedule to the A.D.E. Act will follow and nothing more.
The A.D.E. Act does not affect the legislative competence of
the State Legislature to make a law with reference to any of
the entries in List-II. The contention of Sri Ganesh on this
score is accordingly rejected.
</p><p id="p_51">     Pausing here,  we may  mention a  particular submission
made by	 Sri Ganesh  on this  score. He	 submitted that this
very question  [considered by  us under	 Question No.3]	 has
been referred  by a Bench of this Court to  the Constitution
Bench by  its Order  dated January  2, 1995, a copy af which
has been  placed before	 us. The  Order does not support the
submission of  the learned counsel. It does not say that the
reference to  the Constitution	Bench was on this point. Sri
Ganesh submitted  that this  is one of the points arising in
the said  matter. However, in the absence of any  indication
in the	Order of reference that this particular question was
referred to the Constitution Bench, we declined to accede to
his request  to tag  these matters to Special Leave Petition
(C) No.21476  of 1994  for being  heard by  the Constitution
Bench. It  should also	be noticed that the main ground upon
which the High court has invalidated the impugned <a href="/doc/1054471/" id="a_61">Bihar Act</a>,
or certain  provisions thereof, as the case may be, is in no
way relatable  to the  A.D.E. Act. The High Court has indeed
refused to  go into  this question in view of its finding on
other issues.  Even before  us, the  contention was not that
the  Bihar  Legislature	 had  no  competence  to  enact	 the
impugned <a href="/doc/1054471/" id="a_62">Bihar	Act</a> but	 only that it ought not have done so
in view	 of the decision of the National Development Council
to which the State of Bihar was	 a party and which agreement
led to	the enactment  of the Act. Since the question before
us  is	 one  of  legislative  competence  and	not  one  of
desirability of	 making such an enactment, the submission of
the learned counsel was	 unacceptable to us.
Question No-4: Whether the impugned enactment is outside the
purview of  Entry 52  in List-II  of the Seventh Schedule to
the Constitution  and,	therefore,  beyond  the	 legislative
competence of  the Bihar  Legislature for the reason that it
does not  provide for  the revenues  raised thereunder to be
passed on  to the  local authorities  for being used for the
purposes of such local authorities?
</p><p id="p_52">     The next  submission of  Sri Ganesh is that inasmuch as
the impugned <a href="/doc/1054471/" id="a_63">Bihar Act</a> does not contain any provision or any
indication that	 the taxes  collected under  the Act will be
passed on  to the local authorities, it cannot be said to be
a  tax	 contemplated  by   Entry  52  in  List-II.  Counsel
submitted, on  the basis  of certain decisions of this Court
to which  we shall  presently refer,  that the	said tax  is
essentially in	the nature  of octroi which was being levied
by the	local authorities  prior to  the Government of India
Act, 1935.  Octroi was	levied by  the local  authorities to
raise money for their own purposes. It was meant to meet the
financial  needs  of  the  local  authorities  and  not	 for
supplementing or  augmenting the  general  finances  of	 the
State.	The   impugned	<a href="/doc/1054471/" id="a_64">Bihar  Act</a>,  however,  seeks  to  do
precisely that	which is  not contemplated;  by Entry 52. It
has levied the impugned tax for the purpose of supplementing
and augmenting	the  finances  of  the	State  and  not	 the
finances of  the local	authorities and	 hence, outside	 the
purview of Entry 52 in List-II, says Sri Ganesh.
</p><p id="p_53">     Sri Ganesh relied upon the following decisions:
     <a href="/doc/1432129/" id="a_65">In Central	 India Spinning	 &amp; Weaving  &amp;  Manufacturing
Co.Ltd.,  The	Empress	 Mills,	  Nagpur  v.  The  Municipal
Committee, Wardha</a>  [1958 S.C.R.1102],  this Court  observed:
"The legislative  history of this tax thus shows that octroi
was leviable  on the entry of goods in a local area when the
goods were  for consumptions  use or  sale therein........In
the  absence   of  clear  intention  to	 the  contrary,	 the
incidence of the tax leviable under item 8 of Schedule II of
the Schedule  Tax Rules	 is incapable  of having a different
complexion from	 that which it had before 1920 or that which
was clearly given after 1935."

Pradesh &amp;  Anr</a>. [1961 (3) S.C.R.242], this Court referred to
the previous  legislative  history  including  the  position
obtaining  under   the	Government   of	 India	 Acts  1919,
Notification No.311/8  dated December  18, 1920 and Entry 49
of  List-II  of	 the  Government  of  India  Act,  1935	 and
observed: "It was with the knowledge of the previous history
of the	legislation that  the Constitution-makers  set about
their task  in preparing  the lists in the seventh schedule.
There can  be little doubt therefore that in using the words
'tax  on   the	entry	of  goods  into	 a  local  area	 for
consumption, use or sale therein', they wanted to express by
the words  'local area' primarly ares in respect of which an
octroi was  leviable under item 7 of the schedule tax rules,
1920 -	that is,  the area administered by a local authority
such as a municipality, a district Board, a local Board or a
Union Board,  a Panchayat or some body constituted under the
law for	 the governance	 of the local affairs of any part of
the State....'.

Ltd. v.	 The Belgaum  Borough Municipality</a>  [1963 Suppl. (2)
S.C.R.216], this  Court again  traced legislative history of
octroi and  terminal taxes  and held  that octroi was always
understood as  a tax  leviable on  the entry of goods into a
local area for consumption, use or sale therein.
</p><p id="p_56">     We find  it difficult  to agree  with the submission of
Sri Ganesh  Entry 49  of List-II  of the Seventh Schedule to
the Government	of India  Act, 1935  as well  as Entry 52 in
List-II in  our Constitution  speak of "local areas" and not
"local authorities"  The tax,  by whatever  name called,  is
levied upon  the entry	of  goods  into	 a  local  area	 for
consumption, use  or sale therein. The decisions relied upon
by Sri	Ganesh too use the same words. Entry 52 empowers the
State Legislature  to levy  this tax.  The local authorities
cannot themselves  levy this  tax.  The power is that of the
State Legislature  and of  none else.  So long as the tax is
levied upon  the entry	of goods  into a  local area for the
purpose of consumption, use or sale therein, the requirement
of Entry 52 is satisfied. The character of the tax so levied
is that	 of entry  tax -  by whatever name it is called. The
decisions relied  upon by  Sri Ganesh  do not  say that	 the
State must levy the tax and make over the collection part of
it  to	 local	authorities  nor  do  they  say	 that  after
collecting it,	the State must make over the proceeds to the
local  authorities.   The  highest   that  Sri	 Ganesh	 can
legitimately put his submission is that the tax is meant for
and must  be utilised for the purpose of the local areas. It
cannot further be stipulated that this utilisation should be
through or  by	the  concerned	local  authorities.  In	 our
opinion, the  relevant requirement is satisfied in this case
As stated hereinbefore, the entire State of Bihar is devided
into local  areas. From	 the point of view of the entry tax,
one may	 say that  the State is a compendium of local areas.
Spending for  the purposes of the State is thus spending for
the purposes  of  local	 areas.	 Situation  may	 perhaps  be
different where the local areas are confined to a few cities
or towns  in the  State. But  where the local areas span the
entire State,  it cannot  be argued  that  money  spent	 for
welfare schemes	 for improvement  of roads, rivers and other
means of  transport and communication is not spent on or for
the purposes  of local area. The purposes and needs of local
areas are  no different	 from the  purposes and needs of the
State -	 not at	 any rate to any appreciable degree. In this
context, it is relevant to notice that the Maharashtra Entry
Tax Act,  considered by	 this Court in Shakti Kumar was also
meant for  augmenting the general revenues of State, to wit,
to make	 up the	 loss of  revenue the State was suffering on
account of  reduction of  sales tax on motor vehicles in the
adjoining States.  The following  observations in  the	said
decision tend  to support our reasoning, though, it is true,
this particular question was not raised therein:
</p><p id="p_57">     "A very perusal of these objects and reasons would
indicate that this legislation was brought in order to
compensate loss of revenues by consumers who avoid of
payment of the sales tax or purchase tax on the vehicle
payable in the State by purchasing it in another  State
where the rate was lesser than the State of Maharashtra and
then to bring the vehicle inside the State. The Legislature,
therefore, clearly intended to avoid any loss of legitimate
sales tax  revenue by the State. But the levy cannot be held
to be bad because the Legislature intended to avoid any loss
of sales in the State so long it is not found to be invalid
either because of any constitutional or statutory
     "3. Charge of Tax.--(l) There shall
     ba levied	and collected  a tax  on
     entry of  scheduled  goods	 into  a
     local area for  consumption, use or
     sale  therein   at	 such  rate  not
     exceeding	five  percentum	 of  the
     import value  of such  goods as may
     be	  specified    by   the	   State
     Government	  in	a   notification
     published in  an  official	 gazette
     subject to	 such conditions  as may
     be prescribed.
</p><p id="p_58">	  Provided different  rates  for
     different	 scheduled   goods   and
     different	local	areas	may   be
     specified by the State Government.</p>
<p id="p_59">     6. Exemption  from Tax.-- The State
     Government may  by notification and
     subject	to    such    conditions
     restriction as it may impose exempt
     from  tax	 any  class  of	 dealers
     persons or importers."
</p><p id="p_60">     The  proviso   to	<a href="/doc/198829/" id="a_68">Section	  3(1)</a>	empower,  the  State
Government to  specify different  rates	 of  entry  tax	 for
different commodities  mentioned in the Schedule to the Act.
This is,  however, subject  to the  ceiling of	five percent
specified in  <a href="/doc/198829/" id="a_69">Section 3</a>	 itself. in  such  a  situations  it
cannot be  held that  the power	 conferred  upon  the  State
Government to  specify the  rate  of  tax  is  unguided.  <a href="/doc/1417510/" id="a_70">In
Municipal Corporation  of Delhi	 v. Birla  Cotton Spinning &amp;
Weaving Mills,	Delhi &amp;	 Anr</a>. [1968  (3) S.C.R.25l],  it was
held that  where the power is given to a responsible elected
body like  the municipal  corporation to prescribe the rates
of tax	subject to  a ceiling prescribed and where the rates
fixed have  to	be  submitted  to  the	Government  for	 its
sanctions it  cannot be	 held to  be  a	 case  of  excessive
delegation  of	 legislative  power.   In  this	  cases	 the
delegation is  to the State Government and a ceiling is also
prescribed. The	 State Government must be deemed to be aware
of the needs of the State and the interest of its people. It
is the	State Government  that prepares the budget for every
year. The  very provisions of the Act and its scheme coupled
with the  above factors	 provide sufficient  guidance to the
Government in  the matter  of specification of the rates. It
cannot, therefore,  be held  that  the	proviso	 confers  an
unguided power	upon the  State Government.  Now, coming  to
<a href="/doc/1069905/" id="a_71">Section 6</a>, it confers upon the State Government the power to
grant exemption	 to any	 class of persons from the operation
of the	Act. Such  a power  has consistently  been upheld by
this  Court   in  a  number  of	 decisions  commencing	from
<a href="/doc/231666/" id="a_72">P.J.Irani v. State of Madras</a> [1962 (2) S.C.R. 169]. In fact,
such a	provision is  a common	feature in  all	 the  taxing
enactments and	many other enactments. It has been held that
the very scheme and the provisions of the Act do provide the
necessary guidance. Accordingly, we hold that the High Court
was in	error in  declaring <a href="/doc/1069905/" id="a_73">Section  6</a> to  be void for being
violative of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_74">Article 14.</a>
</p><p id="p_61">     For the above reasons, the appeals arising from Special
Leave Petition (C) Nos.14636-14644 of 1995 [preferred by the
State of  Bihar] are  allowed and  the judgment	 of the High
Court is  set aside.  The appeals arising from Special Leave
Petition (C)  No. 23172 of 1995 [preferred by I.T.C. Limited
&amp; Ors.]	 and Special  Leave Petition  (C) No.  23303 of 1995
[preferred by V.S.T. Industries &amp; Anr.] are dismissed.
