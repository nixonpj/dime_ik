of 1989 and 3985 of 2011.
</p>
<p id="p_2">CWP No.4922 of 1989

              This writ petition has been filed by 86 petitioners, who are

residents of village Bhagupura, Tehsil Patti, District Amritsar, challenging

the order dated 24.8.1988, whereby the revision petition filed by some of

the members of the Cheema Co-operative Agricultural Service Society

Limited, who are residents of villages Cheema, Bhagupura and Barwala,

against the order dated 30.10.1987 passed by the Assistant Registrar, Co-

operative Societies, ordering the bifurcation of the Cheema Co-operative

Agricultural Service Society Limited, was allowed by the Commissioner

(Appeals), Jalandhar Division (exercising the powers of the State

Government), setting aside the said order.
</p>
<p id="p_3">         In this case, the Assistant Registrar, Co-operative Societies, while

exercising the powers of the Registrar, and in view of the Circular dated

19.8.1987 issued by the Registrar, Co-operative Societies, Punjab, for re-

construction of Primary Co-operative Agricultural Service Society, passed

the order of bifurcation of the Cheema Co-operative Agricultural Service

Society Limited under <a href="/doc/156957654/" id="a_1">Section 13(8)</a> of the Punjab Co-operative Societies

Act, 1961 (hereinafter referred to as `the <a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_2">Punjab Act</a>') into two Societies, i.e.,

Cheema Co-operative Agricultural Service Society Limited, the area of

operation of which shall be in villages Cheema and Barwala; and the

Bhagupur Co-operative Agricultural Service Society Limited, Bhagupur, the

area of which shall be in villages Bhagupur, Assol and Sangwan.

</p><p id="p_4">            Some of the members of the parent Cheema Co-operative

Agricultural Service Society Limited, who were having grouse against the

above-said bifurcation order, challenged the said order by filing revision

under <a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_3">Section 69</a> of the Punjab Act, before the State Government. The

Commissioner, Appeals (exercising the powers of the State Government),

allowed the said revision petition and set aside the order dated 30.10.1987

passed by the Assistant Registrar while coming to the conclusion that

without calling and holding the General Body meeting of the parent Society

and considering the objections filed by some of the members, the order of

bifurcation could not have been passed. The said order was challenged in the

aforesaid writ petition by some of the members, who are residents of village

Bhagupur.

<p id="p_5">            At the time of motion hearing, while relying upon a Division

Bench decision of this Court in Hardial Singh, Manager the Shahabad

Farmers Co-operative Marketing-cum-Processing Society Ltd. v. State of

Haryana through Secretary, Co-operative Socities, Haryana, Chandigarh and

others, 1975(1) S.L.R. 55, a contention was raised that against the order of

the Assistant Registrar, Co-operative Societies bifurcating the Society under

<a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_4">Section 13(8)</a> of the Punjab Act, no revision under <a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_5">Section 69</a> of the said

Act was maintainable because under that Section, the revision is

maintainable only on the application made by a person, who is party to a

reference under <a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_6">Section 55</a> of the Punjab Act, and the Government cannot

suo motu exercise the revisional power on a revision filed by the persons,

who are not party to the reference. The learned Division Bench, while

considering some of the observations made by the Hon'ble Supreme Court

in The Everest Apartments Co-operative Housing Society Ltd.. Bombay v.

State of Maharashtra and others, AIR 1966 S.C. 1449, doubted the

correctness of the view taken by the Division Bench in Hardial Singh's case

(supra) and admitted the writ petition to the Full Bench, and passed the

following order:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">             " The revisional power contained in Section 69 of the Punjab
             Cooperative Socieities Act, 1961, appears to be very wide as
             per terms of the statute but that power has been restricted in
             <a href="/doc/322019/" id="a_7">Hardayal Singh vs State of Haryana</a>, 1975 (1) S.L.R. 55, by a
             Divisional Bench of this Court. It is undisputed that if State
             Government exercises suo moto powers of revision then it can
             do so but if the aggrieved party brings the matter to the notice
             of the State Government by way of revision and the State
             Government acts on that without mentioning in the order that
             it is taking suo moto action, according to the aforesaid
             Division Bench judgment, the order would be without
             jurisdiction.

             Supreme Court in AIR 1966 S.C. 1449. Therein, it was
             observed that the Government should welcome an application
             because an aggrieved party can draw the attention of the
             Government to the acts in some of which Government may be
             interested to entertain. Even if the aggrieved party labelled
             his application as a revision under <a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_9">Section 69</a> of the Act,
             prima facie if the Government were to interfere, it would be
             exercising the revisional jurisdiction under Section 69 of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">               C.W.P. No.4922 of 1989                              -5-</span>

              Act, on the basis of information given by the aggrieved party,
              through the application labelled as a revision, and such an
              exercise of revisional jurisdiction would amount to taking suo
              moto action.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">                             Since prima facie, the decision of the Division
              Bench seems to run counter to the statutory provision and the
              Supreme Court decision, we admit this writ petition to Full
              Bench.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">                             Since matter is of importance and is likely to
              arise in large number of cases, we direct that papers of this
              case be placed before Hon'ble the Chief Justice for
              constituting a Full Bench as early as possible.

<p id="p_6">CWP No.14997 of 1989

            This writ petition was filed by one Mehar Singh (since

deceased) challenging the order dated 21.8.1989 passed by the

Commissioner &amp; Secretary to Government, Haryana (exercising the powers

of the State Government), whereby the revision petition filed by the

filing an appeal before the Registrar, Co-operative Societies under the

Common Cadre Rules i.e. Haryana State Central Co-operative bank's Staff

23.1.1989 dismissed the said appeal. Against the said order, the petitioner

filed a revision petition under Section 115 of the Haryana Act before the

State Government which was dismissed by the impugned order dated

<p id="p_17">            In Hardial Singh's case       (supra), a question came up for

consideration before a Division Bench of this Court, whether a revision

petition filed by the Society, which is not a party to a reference, challenging

the order of the Registrar, Co-operative Societies passed under Rule 36 of

the Service Rules, partly accepting the appeal of Hardial Singh, whereby he

was reinstated, however, a penalty of stoppage of four increments with

cumulative effect was imposed and the suspension period of Hardial Singh

was ordered to be treated as duty period, which made him entitled to 50% of

the pay, was maintainable or not. On the revision filed by the Society under

<a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_27">Section 69</a> of the Punjab Act, the said order was set aside. In the writ

petition, Hardial Singh raised the issue that the order passed by the

Government under <a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_28">Section 69</a> of the Punjab Act was without jurisdiction as

no revision under the said Section by the Society was maintainable. On

behalf of Hardial Singh, it was argued that from the plain reading of <a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_29">Section

69</a>, it is clear that a revision could only be filed by a party to a reference.

The Society or the Manager, who filed the revision, was not party to any

such reference, therefore, the State Government in exercise of the suo motu

power should not have set aside the order of the Appellate Authority on the

revision filed by the Society. The Division Bench, after making reference to

            this contention of the learned counsel. <a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_31">Section 69</a> of the Act,
            under which revision was filed is in the following terms:-

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_17">            This section gives revision powers to the State Government in
            cases where no appeal lies under <a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_33">Section 68</a> of the Act and the
            power is exercisable either suo motu or on the application of a
            party to a reference. There is no dispute that the State
            Government did not act suo motu but passed the impugned
            order on the application of the Manager. From the plain
            reading of this section, it is clear that such an application
            could be filed only by a party to a reference. In the instant
            case, admittedly there was no question of the reference of any
            dispute for decision to any authority under the Act. The Society
            or the Manager were not parties to any such reference. It was a
            simple case where the petitioner-Society took disciplinary
            action against the Manager (Petitioner) who filed an appeal
            under rule 36 of the Rules on which the Joint Registrar passed
            an order on 5th March, 1970 (copy Annexure `B' to the

            impugned order was not liable to be quashed as it should be
            deemed to have been passed in exercise of the suo motu powers
            of the State. We are unable to agree with the learned counsel as
            admittedly the impugned order has been passed on the revision
            filed by the Society under <a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_34">section 69</a> of the Act. The
            proceedings were started at the instance of an aggrieved party
            as is evident from the opening part of the order wherein it is
            stated thus :-
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_19">                  " This is a revision petition under <a href="/doc/108006076/" id="a_35">section 69</a> of the

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_20">             In the impugned order it is nowhere said that the action was
             being taken suo motu. If we accept the contention of the
             learned counsel for the State, then no difference would remain
             in the action taken by an appropriate authority suo motu and
             the one taken on the application of an aggrieved party. It
             could never be the intention of the legislature to treat both on
             the same footing. Thus we are of the considered view that no

               arise only when an aggrieved person brings the order to the

               which debars an aggrieved person from moving the revisional
               authority to invoke its suo motu powers. The moment it is
               accepted that an aggrieved person can move for invoking the

             is to send for the records of the case pending or decided by
             the Subordinate authorities to examine the same and to pass
             appropriate orders modifying, annulling or reversing the
             same. Such power can be exercised when the Revising
             Authority comes to know about the legality or propriety of
             passing such orders. Further, this knowledge can be acquired
             either at the instance of the Revising Authority itself or at the
             instance of aggrieved or interested party. The opening words
             of <a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_40">Section 69</a> reproduced above with respect to "suo motu"or
             "onapplication of the parties to the reference"are explanatory
             in nature. They are neither superfluous nor redundant. Even
             in the absence of phraseology used the remaining context of
             the provision referred to above still would clothe the

             the instance of interested party or suo motu. The order passed

              revisional authority, it is left to the revisional authority to
              examine the records and then to pass the appropriate order.
              Similar course could be adopted even if the matter had come

<blockquote id="blockquote_26">             Thus, in the aforesaid Full Bench decision, the law laid down

by the Division Bench in Hardial Singh's case (supra) was held to be not

tenable in law. The said decision has virtually made the questions of law

referred in CWP No.4922 of 1989 as infructuous. In Gurnam Kaur's case

(supra), the Full Bench has laid down firstly that the action to exercise

revisional jurisdiction could be initiated either by an aggrieved party or by

the authority of its own. It is not necessary that only a party to the reference

can invoke the revisional jurisdiction. Secondly, it has been laid down that

the suo motu power can be exercised by the revisional authority either of its

own or on the application moved by the aggrieved party if the said authority

is satisfied that any such decision or order is required to be modified,

pertaining to the scope of <a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_47">Section 69</a> came up for consideration before a

maintainable against the order passed by the Registrar, Co-operative Society

as an Appellate Authority under the Statutory Service Rules of the Society

was the employee of the Punjab State Handloom Weavers Apex Society

Limited. His services were terminated on the charge of wilful absence from

duty and creating indiscipline in the office. He filed an appeal before the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">               C.W.P. No.4922 of 1989                               -17-</span>

Additional Registrar (General) under the Statutory Service Rules of the

Society, which was dismissed. Feeling aggrieved against the said order, he

filed a revision under <a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_49">Section 69</a> of the Punjab Act before the Commissioner

(Appeals). The said revision was dismissed in limine. The respondent

challenged the said order in writ petition which was allowed on the ground

that the order of the revisional authority was not a speaking order, and

thereafter, the matter was remanded to the revisional authority to take a

fresh decision on merits, in accordance with law, after hearing the parties.

On remand before the revisional authority, the Society raised the issue of

maintainability of the revision petition but while rejecting the said plea the

order of punishment was set aside while holding that the same was

disproportionate to the charge proved against the employee. Accordingly,

the punishment was reduced to stoppage of three annual increments with

cumulative effect. The said order was challenged by the Society in the writ

petition on the ground that the revision was not maintainable. While

dismissing the writ petition, the Division Bench of this Court had observed

as under:-

            In a subsequent judgment, the Division Bench of this Court in

Deepak Kumar Kalia v. Punjab State Handloom Weavers Apex Co-op.Soc.

and ors., 2007(1) R.C.R. (Civil) 805, took the similar view and held that

under Section 69 of the Punjab Act the State Government as well as the

Registrar have been empowered to examine the legality or propriety of any

decision or order passed by a Society. In that case, an employee of the

Society was removed from services by the Managing Director of the

Society. Against the said order, he filed a statutory appeal under the

Statutory Service Rules. The Appellate Authority (Assistant Registrar) set

aside the order of removal, however, with liberty to the Punishing Authority

to impose minor penalty. Aggrieved against the said order, the Society filed

a revision under <a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_50">Section 69</a> of the Punjab Act. The said revision was

allowed and the order passed by the Appellate Authority was set aside. The
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">               C.W.P. No.4922 of 1989                               -19-</span>

said order was challenged by the employee in the writ petition on the

ground that the revision filed by the Society under <a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_51">Section 69</a> was not

maintainable. The Division Bench of this Court, by following the earlier

Division Bench decision of this Court in Punjab State Handloom Weavers'

case (supra), dismissed the said writ petition while observing that :

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_30">             ".......a perusal of the above provision shows that the State
             Government as well as the Registrar have been empowered to

             In the aforesaid two cases, it has been held that under Section

69 of the Punjab Act the State Government as well as the Registrar have

been empowered to examine the legality or propriety of any decision or

order passed by the Society. They can do so either suo motu or on the

application of a party to a reference.</blockquote><p id="p_27">

</p><p id="p_28">             The ratio of law laid down in the above two cases to the effect

that under Section 69 of the Punjab Act the State Government as well as the

Registrar have been empowered to examine the legality or propriety of any

decision or order passed by the Society further leads to other questions of

law and goes contrary to the earlier decisions given by this Court. The

question that arises for consideration is whether the legality or propriety of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">               C.W.P. No.4922 of 1989                            -20-</span>

any decision or order passed by the Society can be examined by the State

Government or the Registrar under the revisional jurisdiction or such power

can be exercised by the State Government only pertaining to the order

passed by the authority under the Act or an order arising out of the

proceedings under the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_29">             In Punjab State Handloom Weavers' case (supra) and Deepak

Kumar Kalia's case (supra), the orders, which were questioned before the

revisional authority, were the orders passed by the Registrar or the Deputy

Registrar as an Appellate Authority under the Statutory Service Rules

against the disciplinary action, and those orders were not the orders of the

Society itself. But the learned Division Bench while deciding that against

the order of the Appellate Authority the revision was maintainable, has

observed that under Section 69 of the Punjab Act the Government as well as

the Registrar have been empowered to examine the legality or propriety of

any decision or order passed by the Society.
</p>
<p id="p_30">              It is pertinent to mention here that in those cases the order

under challenge before the revisional authority was not an order passed by

the Society but was an order passed by the Appellate Authority under the

Statutory Service Rules. This difference was not noticed in the aforesaid

two cases.
</p>
<p id="p_31">             This Court in an earlier occasion has recognized the difference

between the order of the Society and the order of the authority passed under

the <a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_52">Punjab Act</a>. The Division Bench of this Court in Binpalka Co-operative

Agricultural Service Society Ltd. v. Commissioner (Appeals), Jalandhar

Division, 1993(2) R.R.R. 1 (P&amp;H) has considered this issue. In that case,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">               C.W.P. No.4922 of 1989                               -21-</span>

after obtaining prior approval of the Registrar, Co-operative Societies and

passing a resolution, the Binpalka Co-operative Agricultural Service Society

Ltd. was bifurcated into two Societies under <a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_53">Section 13(1)(b)</a> of the Punjab

Act. In the Resolution passed by the Society it was also mentioned that the

Secretary of the Society who was under suspension will be reinstated and

given employment in one of the Societies. The said order was challenged by

the Secretary by filing a revision under <a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_54">Section 69</a> of the Punjab Act before

the State Government. The said revision petition was allowed and the

Secretary was allocated to the parent Society. The parent Society, i.e.,

Binpalka Co-operative Agricultural Service Society Ltd. challenged the said

order by filing the writ petition on the ground that no revision petition

against the order of the Society was maintainable. The Division Bench

formulated a question of law whether the State Government can entertain a

revision petition against the order of the Society voluntarily bifurcating the

Society into two Societies and further transferring one of the employees to a

particular Society. The Division Bench answered the said question in

negative and held that the revision petition filed by the Secretary against the

order of voluntary bifurcation of the Society by passing the resolution even

after taking prior approval of the Registrar is not maintainable and has

observed as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_31">             "5. From perusal of the aforesaid provision, it is clear that a
             society could be bifurcated in two manners; firstly under
             orders of the Registrar and secondly after obtaining prior
             approval of the Registrar by passing resolution by the society
             concerned itself. Present is a case which falls under <a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_55">section 13</a>
             (1)(b) of the Act as aforesaid. The bifurcation of the society
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">             C.W.P. No.4922 of 1989                               -22-</span>

           was made after obtaining prior approval of the Registrar and
           by passing the resolution. If that is so, such bifurcation is not
           under any order of the Registrar which could be revised.
           Further reference was made to sub-clause (i) sub-section (8) of
           <a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_56">section 13</a> of the Act that the order of the Registrar could fall
           thereunder. We are afraid, this contention again cannot be
           accepted. This section contemplates an order to be passed by
           the Registrar on his satisfaction that any co-operative society
           be divided into two or more such co-operative societies. As
           already stated above, no order under sub-section (8) of <a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_57">Section
           13</a> of the Act was passed. What has been shown during
           argument is an order of the Registrar dated November 2, 1987
           which has been passed after noticing the fact that the society
           was bifurcated by passing resolution by the society itself after
           obtaining prior approval of the Registrar and hence the
           registration of the society was cancelled and on splitting the
           two new societies were ordered to be registered under the
           provisions of the Act, which is entirely different from
           bifurcating the registered societies as contemplated under
           <a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_58">Section 13</a> of the Act, by the Registrar. The State Government
           had no jurisdiction to pass order dated January 12, 1989-
           Annexure P.2 and same is void."</blockquote><p id="p_32">



</p><p id="p_33">            In the aforesaid decision, a distinction has been made between

two types of bifurcation of the societies, i.e., voluntary bifurcation by the

society by passing a resolution after obtaining prior approval of the

Registrar, as contemplated under <a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_59">Section 13(1)(b)</a>, and a compulsory

bifurcation by order of the Registrar, as contemplated under <a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_60">Section 13(8)</a>

of the Punjab Act. It has been held that if a society has been compulsory

bifurcated by an order of the Registrar, in that case, the aggrieved person
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">              C.W.P. No.4922 of 1989                               -23-</span>

can challenge the said order before the State Government by invoking the

revisional jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_61">Section 69</a> of the Punjab Act because the said

act was the act of the Registrar and not the act of the Society. This decision

is the complete answer to the controversy raised in CWP No.4922 of 1989.

In the said case the order passed by the Assistant Registrar, Co-operative

Society, exercising the powers of the Registrar, compulsorily bifurcating

the Cheema Co-operative Agricultural Society Limited under <a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_62">Section 13(8)</a>

of the Punjab Act was rightly challenged by the aggrieved person by filing

a revision under <a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_63">Section 69</a> of the Punjab Act because the order of

compulsory bifurcation was passed by the Registrar under the Act. That

was not an action of the Society, whereas in Binpalka's case (supra), which

was a case of voluntary bifurcation, the action of voluntary bifurcation was

an action of the Society. Therefore, in that case it was held that against the

said action of the Society no revision is maintainable.

</p><p id="p_34">            A similar issue again came up for consideration before a

Division Bench of this Court in <a href="/doc/1443310/" id="a_64">Rajinder Singh v. The Registrar,

Cooperative Societies, Punjab and others</a>, 2001(1) PLJ 81. In that case,

election programme by filing a revision petition under <a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_65">Section 69</a> of the

Punjab Act. The Registrar, Cooperative Societies entertained the said

revision petition and passed the interim order restraining the petitioner

from performing his duties as Director. The petitioner challenged the said

order by filing the writ petition. This Court questioned the maintainability

of the revision petition against the election programme issued by the

 Society while observing that:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_32">             "the revision petition itself was not maintainable under
             <a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_66">Section 69</a> of the Act. A petition can be entertained by the
             State Government or the Registrar as the case may be for the
             purpose of examining legality or propriety of any decision or
             the order passed in any proceedings under the Act. There was
             no order passed by any authority which was challenged
             before the Registrar nor were any proceedings pending, the
             propriety of which could be examined by him. What was
             sought to be challenged in the revision petition was the
             election programme approved by the Deputy Registrar
             exercising the powers of the Registrar and not the election of
             the petitioner as a Director. In this view of the matter, the
             order of the Registrar restraining the petitioner from
             performing his duties as an elected Director of the Bank is
             without jurisdiction." (Emphasis added)

             Thus, in the aforesaid case a distinction was made between a

decision, action or order passed by the Society or a decision or an order

passed by the authority in any proceedings under the Act.</blockquote><p id="p_35">

Amritsar v. Deputy Registrar(E) Cooperative Societies, Punjab and another</a>,

2009(4) SCT 174 in which one of us (Satish Kumar Mittal, J.) was a

whether the disciplinary proceedings initiated against the employee of the

Co-operative Bank for committing various embezzlement and fraud and the

issuance of the charge-sheet and order of suspension by the supervisory

committee of the petitioner bank, could be questioned by the suspended
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">              C.W.P. No.4922 of 1989                              -25-</span>

employee before the State Government by invoking the revisional

jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_68">Section 69</a> of the Punjab Act. In that case, the State

Government under the revisional jurisdiction set aside the order of

suspension on the ground that the employee could not have been placed

under suspension for a period exceeding six months without the prior

approval of the Registrar. The Co-operative Bank challenged the said order

by filing the writ petition. The respondent employee while relying upon

aforesaid two Division Bench decisions of this Court in Punjab State

Handloom Weavers Apex Society Ltd.'s case (supra) and Deepak Kumar

Kalia's case (supra), argued that the State Government as well as the

Registrar have been empowered to examine the legality or propriety of any

decision or order passed by the Society. The said contention of the counsel

for the employee was not accepted and it was held that the order passed by

the Government setting aside the order of suspension of the employee in

revision under <a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_69">Section 69</a> of the Punjab Act was wholly without

jurisdiction. As against the order of suspension and issuing the charge-sheet

passed by the society, no revision under <a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_70">Section 69</a> of the Punjab Act was

maintainable. It was held that the revision under <a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_71">Section 69</a> of the Act lies

against the order passed by the Subordinate Authorities under the Act, and

since the order of suspension and issuance of charge-sheet was not passed

by an authority or in any proceedings under the Act, such order passed by

the society under the Service Rules cannot be challenged in revision under

<a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_72">Section 69</a> of the Act. Regarding the aforesaid two decisions of the Division

Bench, it was observed that the two judgments relied upon by the learned

counsel for the respondent do not support the case of respondent No.2,

Authority under the Statutory Rules and not by the Society.

(Civil) 548 again a similar question was raised before the Single Bench of

this Court. In that case, petitioner Dr.S.P.Gupta was working as General

Manager in the Punjab State Federation of Co-operative Milk Producers

Union Limited (Milkfed). At the fag end of his retirement he was served

with a charge-sheet on account of certain irregularities committed by him

which resulted in loss to Milkfed. The said charge-sheet was inquired into

and he was found guilty of the charges by the Enquiry Officer. On the basis

of the said report an order of punishment was passed by the Disciplinary

Authority. Feeling aggrieved against the said order, the petitioner filed an

appeal under the Service Rules before the Board of Directors of the Milkfed

which was dismissed. The said order was challenged by the petitioner by

filing a revision under <a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_74">Section 69</a> of the Punjab Act before the Registrar,

Co-operative Societies, Punjab. Vide order dated 13.6.2008, the said

revision was dismissed by the Registrar while observing that the same was

not maintainable because the revision lies against the order passed by an

authority subordinate to the Registrar, Co-operative Societies, Punjab,

whereas the Board of Directors of the Milkfed are not the authorities

subordinate to the Registrar. The said order was challenged by the petitioner

by filing the writ petition. The Single Judge, in which one of us (Satish

that the Registrar, Co-operative Societies, Punjab had rightly dismissed the

revision filed by the petitioner being not maintainable, while following his

earlier decision in Amritsar Central Cooperative Bank's case (supra).

</p><p id="p_38">            Learned counsel for the petitioner in CWP No.3985 of 2011

argued that the decision rendered in Dr. S.P. Gupta's case (supra) does not

lay down the correct law as the words "any direction or order" mentioned in

<a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_75">Section 69</a> of the Punjab Act includes the decision and order taken by a Co-

operative Society under the Statutory Rules. The revisional powers of the

State Government or the Registrar are wide enough and include the decision

and order passed by the Society. According to the learned counsel, it is not

necessary that only the decision and orders which have been passed by an

authority under the Act are amenable to the revisional jurisdiction. But in

view of the aforesaid discussion, the contention raised by the learned

counsel for the petitioner is not acceptable. In Binpalka Co-opertative

Agricultural Service Society's case (supra) and Rajinder Singh's case

(supra), the Division Benches of this Court have clearly made distinction

between a decision or order passed by the Society and decision or order

passed by an authority in a proceeding under the Act. In our considered

view, against every decision or order of the Society, even though no appeal

has been provided under <a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_76">Section 68</a> of the Punjab Act or under Section 114

of the Haryana Act, an aggrieved party to such an order or the Government

of its own in exercise of its suo motu power cannot entertain a revision

petition. To that extent, the observation made in Punjab State Handloom

Weavers' case (supra) and Deepak Kumar Kalia's case (supra) does not lay

down the correct law.

observing that only disciplinary proceedings had been initiated by the

society and there were no proceedings under the Act, therefore, the revision

was not competent. The learned Division Bench, after considering a

Division Bench decision of this Court in Punjab State Handloom Weavers'

           which no revision petition was competent."</blockquote><p id="p_41">


</p><p id="p_42">            In order to understand and appreciate the ratio of law laid

down by the aforesaid Division Bench decision, it is necessary to notice

the facts and ratio of law laid down in the Single Bench decision of this

Court in Gurdaspur Central Co-operative Bank's case (supra), the Division

Bench decision in Dharam Singh Rao's case (supra) and the decision

rendered by the Supreme Court in Shahabad Cooperative Sugar Mills case

(supra).
</p>
<p id="p_43">            In Gurdaspur Central Co-operative Bank's case (supra), a

question that arises for consideration is whether an order passed by the

Appellate Authority on an appeal filed by an aggrieved employee under the

bye-laws of the Co-operative Society, can be said to be an order having

been made under the provisions of the <a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_81">Punjab Act</a>; and whether against

such an order a revision under <a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_82">Section 69</a> of the Punjab Act is

maintainable. In that case, the respondent was the employee of the Co-

operative Bank. He was charge-sheeted by the Manager of the bank on

certain allegations. His reply to the charge-sheet was considered by a Sub

Committee formed by the Board of Directors of the bank and in its opinion

the respondent had embezzled two amounts of the Society. The Board of

Directors, while accepting the report of the Sub Committee, dismissed the

respondent from service by passing a resolution. Against that order, the

respondent filed an appeal under the bye-laws of the petitioner-Bank to the

Registrar. The Deputy Registrar, exercising the powers of the Registrar,

dismissed the appeal and upheld the order of the Board of directors while
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_28">             C.W.P. No.4922 of 1989                              -30-</span>

coming to the conclusion that the charge regarding embezzlement of one

amount, i.e., `400/- had not been established, but the charge with regard to

embezzlement of `1700/- had been established. The respondent employee

challenged the said order by filing a revision under <a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_83">Section 69</a> of the

Punjab Act. The State Government accepted the said revision and set aside

the order of the Deputy Registrar and ordered to re-instate the respondent

in service of the petitioner-Bank from the date of his dismissal. The

petitioner-Bank challenged the said order in the writ petition on the ground

that the State Government was having no jurisdiction to entertain the

revision filed by the employee under <a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_84">Section 69</a> of the Punjab Act. While

allowing the writ petition, the Single Bench of this Court has held as

under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_36">            "3. An appeal under <a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_85">section 68(1)(b)</a> of the Act lies against
            any decision or award made under <a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_86">section 56</a> of the Act.
            Admittedly, in the instant case, no reference to arbitration was
            made to decide the dispute between the petitioner and
            respondent No.2. Respondent No.2 was dismissed from
            service by the petitioner-Bank under by-law 37, and an
            appeal provided by that by-law was dismissed by the Deputy
            Registrar, Cooperative Societies. No further remedy was open
            to respondent 2 under the by-laws and that order cannot be
            said to have been made under the provisions of the Act nor on
            a reference to arbitration so that neither an appeal lay under
            <a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_87">section 68</a> nor a revision under <a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_88">section 69</a> of the Act. The
            order passed by the State Government is wholly without
            jurisdiction and is liable to be quashed."
</blockquote>


<p id="p_44">This judgment was prior to the judgment given in Hardial Singh's case
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_29">              C.W.P. No.4922 of 1989                               -31-</span>

(supra). The restricted view taken in this judgment was subsequently

reiterated by Hardial Singh's case (supra). The     notable   ratio   of   the

judgment is that if an appeal provided under the bye-laws is dismissed,

then no further remedy was open to respondent No.2 under the bye-laws

and that order cannot be said to have been made under the provisions of

the <a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_89">Punjab Act</a> or on a reference to arbitration. The correctness of this

decision was doubted by the learned Single Judge in Dharam Singh Rao's

case (supra). In that case, the petitioner Dharam Singh was working as

Manager of the Panipat Primary Co-operative Land Mortgage Bank

Limited. He was charge-sheeted by the Mortgage Bank. After inquiry in the

charges he was dismissed from service. He filed an appeal before the

Registrar under the Service Rules of the Bank, which was dismissed. The

petitioner challenged the said order by filing a revision petition before the

State Government under <a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_90">Section 69</a> of the Punjab Act. The State

Government dismissed the said revision on the ground that under Rule 10

of the Service Rules of the Bank, the decision of the appellate authority

shall be final and binding on the parties and as such no revision petition lay

before the Government. The petitioner challenged the said order by filing

the writ petition. The respondent-Bank prayed for dismissal of the writ

petition in light of the decision in Gurdaspur Central Co-operative Bank's

case (supra). The learned Single Judge doubted the correctness of the said

decision and referred the matter to the larger Bench while making the

following observations:-
</p>
<p id="p_45">            "It appears that certain statutory provisions were not brought
            to the notice of the learned Judge who decided this case.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_30">  C.W.P. No.4922 of 1989                               -32-</span>

<a href="/doc/108006076/" id="a_91">Section 85</a> of the Punjab Co-operative Societies Act, 1961 as
applicable to Haryana and hereinafter referred to as the Act,
laws down that the Government may make rules to carry out
the purposes of this Act. Sub-section (2)(xxxviii) empowers the
Government to make rules regarding the qualifications for the
members of the committee and employees of a Society or class
of societies and the conditions of service subject to which
persons may be employed by societies. Under this provision,
the Government has framed rule 8 which enjoins upon a Co-
operative Society to make bye-laws in respect of appointment,
suspension and removal of the officers of the co-operative
society and members of the committee. The bye-laws made by a
Co-operative Society under this provision, if properly made,
would be regarded as a part of the rule itself. In that sense, if
an employee of the Co-operative Society is dismissed from
service, it could be said that the action has been taken against
him under the provisions of the statute. It is not disputed that
no appeal lies before the Government under <a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_92">section 68</a> of the
Act at the instance of an employee of a Co-operative Society.
In this situation, <a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_93">section 69</a> would be attracted and the
Government would be competent to call for the record of the
case in exercise of its revisional powers.
</p><p id="p_46">      3.      In the instant case, the officer empowered to act as
State Government has relied upon rule 10 framed by the Bank
which shows that the order passed by the Registrar in appeal
shall be final and binding.
</p><p id="p_47">      4.      Now, it is settled law that subordinate rule-making
authority must act within the ambit of the provisions of the
statute which confers a jurisdiction upon it to make rules. The
Legislature    has   invested   the   State   Government     with
jurisdiction to exercise revisional powers under <a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_94">section 69</a> of
the Act. The Bank which draws its strength from rule 8 of the
Rules framed under the Act cannot frame a rule which whittles
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_31">             C.W.P. No.4922 of 1989                              -33-</span>

           down jurisdiction of the Government to entertain a revision
           petition under <a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_95">section 69</a> of the Act. The order passed by the
           Joint Secretary to Government does not appear to be in
           accordance with law.
</p><p id="p_48">                  5.    Had    the   Government    declined    to   exercise
           revisional powers on merits, then perhaps there would have
           been no case for interference under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_96">Article 226</a> of the
           Constitution of India. But in this case, power to exercise
           revisional jurisdiction has been exercised on the basis that no
           revision petition is competent before the State Government. In
           this situation, the order dated 8th January, 1971 (Annexure `C')
           deserves to be set aside and the case deserves to be remanded
           back to the Officer for decision in accordance with law, but
           sitting in Single Bench I cannot take a contrary view than the
           one taken by the learned Judge of this Court in Gurdaspur
           Central Co-operative Bank case (supra)."
</p>
<p id="p_49">

            But when the matter was placed before the Division Bench,

the Division Bench dismissed the writ petition in view of the decision

given in Hardial Singh's case (supra), while observing as under:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_37">           " The interpretation of <a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_97">section 69</a> of the Act given in Hardial
           Singh's case (supra) could not have escaped the attention of
           the Legislature. <a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_98">The Act</a> was amended on at least five
           occasions and yet the Legislature did not deem it proper to
           amend <a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_99">section 69</a> of the Act. Even otherwise, the decision
           rendered by a Division Bench in Hardial Singh's case (supra)
           is binding on us. Under these circumstances, it must be held
           that it was not open to the State Government to revise the order
           of the Registrar on an application made by the petitioner."</blockquote><p id="p_50">



</p><p id="p_51">            It appears that the Division Bench has not gone into the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_32">              C.W.P. No.4922 of 1989                                -34-</span>

question raised in the reference order, whether the bye-laws made by the

Co-operative Society under Rule 8 of the Punjab Co-operative Society

Rules framed by the Government under Sub-section (2)(xxxviii)

empowering the Government to frame rules regarding the conditions of

service subject to which persons may be employed by the Societies, would

be regarded as a part of the rule itself. If that is so, in case an employee of

the Co-operative Society is dismissed from service, it could be said that the

action has been taken against him under the provisions of the statute. In

that situation, where no appeal lies before the Government, a revision

under <a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_100">Section 69</a> would be maintainable against the order of the Assistant

Registrar dismissing the appeal of an employee.
</p>
<p id="p_52">             There are three categories of Service Rules which can be

framed to regulate the conditions of service of the employees of the

Society. In first category, a registered Society under the <a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_101">Societies Act</a> can

frame its own Service Rules to regulate the service conditions of its

employees. The Rules may be binding between the Society and its

employees. The second category of the Rules is those rules which are

formulated under <a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_102">Section 85(2)</a> (xxxviii), which empower the Government

to frame Service Rules for any Co-operative Society or for class of

societies with regard to qualifications for employees of a Society or class

of society and the conditions of service subject to which persons may be

employed by Societies. Such Rules so framed have the force of Statute and

are deemed to be incorporated as a part of the Statute, whereas this

principle does not apply to the first category of Rules framed by the

Society because those Rules merely govern the internal management,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_33">              C.W.P. No.4922 of 1989                             -35-</span>

business or administration of a society. They are of the nature of the

Articles of Association of a Company incorporated under the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_103">Companies

Act</a>. They may be binding between the persons affected by them, but they

do not have the force of a statute. But the second category of Rules is the

Statutory Rules and they have the force of the statute. Similarly, there is

third category of Rules known as Common Cadre Rules. These rules could

have been framed under <a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_104">Section 84-A</a> of the Punjab Act which provide that

an apex society may suo motu and when required to do so by the Registrar

shall constitute a common cadre of all, or specified class of employee in

the service of that society or in the service of the central societies which

are members of the apex society or in the service of the primary societies

which are members of the apex society. Sub-section (2) further provides

that when a common cadre of employee is constituted under sub-section

(1), the Registrar shall notwithstanding anything contained in any law for

the time being in force or any agreement, settlement or award determine

the pay scales and allowances admissible to such employees and Apex

Society shall make rules for the regulation of recruitment and conditions of

service of such employees with the prior approval of the Registrar.

Therefore, the Common Cadre Rules framed under sub-section (2) by the

Registrar are also having the statutory colour and stand on the same

footing as that of the Statutory Rules.
</p>
<p id="p_53">             In   Co-operative Central Bank's case (supra), the Hon'ble

Supreme Court has held that if a statute gives power to a Government or

other authority to make rules, the rules so framed have the force of statute

and are to be deemed to be incorporated as a part of the statute. Thus, in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_34">               C.W.P. No.4922 of 1989                               -36-</span>

 case an employee of the Co-operative Society is dismissed from service

 and he is governed by the Statutory Rules and Common Cadre Rules which

 provide him a remedy to challenge the said order in appeal before the

 Registrar as an Appellate Authority, and if the said appeal is decided by the

 Appellate Authority, the aggrieved party, may be the employee or the

 society, can challenge that order by filing a revision under <a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_105">Section 69</a> of

 the Punjab Act as against such an order no remedy of appeal has been

 provided under <a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_106">Section 68</a> of the Punjab Act. Thus, the Division Bench in

 Gurdaspur Central Co-operative Bank's case (supra) dismissed the writ

 petition filed by the Society by following the restricted view taken in

 Hardial Singh's case (supra) without properly appreciating the issue raised

 by the learned Single Judge in a reference made to the Division Bench.

</p><p id="p_54">            In Shahabad Cooperative Sugar Mills case (supra), which is a

decision under the provisions of the Haryana Act, the employee was

working as Chief Accounts Officer in the Shahabad Cooperative Sugar

Mills. He was charge-sheeted for certain charges. During the pendency of

the departmental enquiry, the employee tendered his resignation. But the

same was not accepted on the ground that the disciplinary proceedings had

already been initiated against him. The said decision was communicated to

the employee. Thereupon he replied that he had already relinquished the

charge, and in view of termination of contract of employment, only one

month's salary was required to be deducted from the amounts due to him. He

had also stated that after tendering his resignation he had joined another job.

In view of these facts, the employee did not attend the departmental

proceedings. In his absence, the Enquiry Officer proceeded against him
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_35">               C.W.P. No.4922 of 1989                              -37-</span>

exparte. On the basis of the ex parte enquiry report, he was dismissed from

service. He filed an appeal before the Registrar of the Cooperative Societies

appears to be under the Common Cadre Rules and not under <a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_107">Section 114</a>.

The Registrar dismissed his appeal. Against the said order, he filed a

revision before the State Government under Section 115 of the Haryana Act.

The said revision petition was allowed and it was held that the enquiry

against the employee was held to be illegal and his dismissal order was set

aside. The Society challenged the said order by filing the writ petition

which was dismissed. The Society further challenged the said order before

the Supreme Court. Before the Supreme Court the Society raised the issue

that the State Government had acted illegally and without jurisdiction while

entertaining the revision petition filed by the employee. The Hon'ble

Supreme Court took note of the fact that the provisions of the <a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_108">Punjab Act</a>

and the Haryana Act are pari materia except certain minor variations, i.e., in

the place of the phrase "to a reference under <a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_109">Section 102</a>" found in the

Haryana Act, the word "to a reference" is noticed in the <a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_110">Punjab Act</a>; in

<a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_111">Punjab Act</a>, the State Government or the Registrar may exercise the

revisional power suo motu or on the application of a party to the reference;

in Haryana Act, only Government may suo motu or on an application of a

party under <a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_112">Section 102</a> can call for and examine the record of any

proceedings in which no appeal lies to the Government under <a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_113">Section 114</a>.

Further taking into consideration the Division Bench decision of this Court

in Hardial Singh's case (supra), which was followed by Single Bench in

Amritsar Central Cooperative Bank's case (supra) and slightly different

view taken in <a href="/doc/118937392/" id="a_114">Jaswant Singh v. The State of Punjab</a>, 1986 Punjab Legal
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_36">               C.W.P. No.4922 of 1989                                -38-</span>

Reports and Statutes (Vol.1) 314 and the Full Bench decision of this Court

in Gurnam Kaur's case (supra) as well as the subsequent decision of this

Court in Punjab State Handloom Weavers case (supra), the Hon'ble Supreme

Court has observed that under the Haryana Act an appeal and revision are

maintainable from an award made by the Arbitrator appointed under <a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_115">Section

102</a> of the Act. The party to a reference under <a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_116">Section 102</a> would mean a

party to arbitration for reference. <a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_117">Section 103</a> provides for an appeal from

an award which may be passed by the Arbitrator appointed in terms of

<a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_118">Section 102</a> of the Act. It does not appear that there exists a similar

provision in the <a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_119">Punjab Act</a>. The second difference which was noticed in the

two Acts is that under the <a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_120">Punjab Act</a> an appeal against the order passed by

the Additional Registrar is maintainable before the Registrar, whereas under

the Haryana Act it would be maintainable only before the State Government.

Revisional power under the <a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_121">Punjab Act</a> is vested both in the Registrar as

also the State Government, whereas under the Haryana Act the revisional

power is vested only in the State Government. While noticing all these, it

was held that (1) the State Government cannot exercise its revisional

jurisdiction if an appeal lies before it. (2) If an appeal lies, a revision would

not lie; and (3) if the revision application was not maintainable, a 'fortiori

suo motu' power could not also be exercised. Even otherwise, if suo motu

power is to be exercised, it has to be stated so. In light of these findings, it

was held that the order passed by the State Government in revision, having

been passed without jurisdiction, was a coram non judice and the High

Court was not correct in holding that the State of Haryana was entitled to

exercise revisional jurisdiction in the facts of the present case. It was
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_37">               C.W.P. No.4922 of 1989                              -39-</span>

noticed in that case that since the employee against his termination order

had preferred an appeal before the Registrar no revision against the order

passed by the Appellate Authority was maintainable because if an appeal

lies, the revisional jurisdiction could not be exercised. It has been further

observed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court that the dispute and differences

between the society and an employee is referable to an Arbitrator under

Section 102 of the Haryana Act and since the third respondent in that case

did not invoke the arbitration proceedings an appeal is maintainable against

the award of an Arbitrator before the State. Therefore, on that ground the

revision petition filed by him was held to be not maintainable.

</p><p id="p_55">            It appears that in the aforesaid case, the correct factual and

legal position was not brought to the notice of the Hon'ble Supreme Court.

In para 6 of the judgment, it has been noticed that against the order of

dismissal from service vide order dated 26.12.1998, the 3rd respondent filed

an appeal before the Registrar, Co-operative Societies under Section 114 of

the Haryana Act, which was dismissed on 9.2.2001. Against the said order

of the Appellate Authority, the 3rd respondent filed a revision before the

State Government which was allowed. This is not the correct factual

position. Against the order passed by the Disciplinary Authority dismissing

the 3rd respondent no appeal lies under Section 114 of the Haryana Act. The

remedy of appeal was provided to the employee under the Common Cadre

Rules before the Registrar and the order of the Registrar is final between the

parties. On the basis of the said incorrect factual position in para 27 of the

judgment, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has observed that admittedly the 3rd

respondent preferred an appeal before the Registrar. Such an appeal was
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_38">                C.W.P. No.4922 of 1989                              -40-</span>

purported to have been filed from an order passed by the Board. Having

taken recourse to the said remedy and having himself invoked appellate

jurisdiction before the Registrar, it does not lie in his mouth to contend that

no appeal was maintainable and in view of Section 115 of the Haryana Act,

the revision does not lie when the remedy of appeal is available to the

aggrieved party under Section 114 of the Haryana Act. Further, the Hon'ble

Supreme Court has observed that under the Haryana Act an appeal or

revision is maintainable from an award made by the Arbitrator appointed in

terms of Section 102 of the Haryana Act. The party to a reference under

<a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_122">Section 102</a> would mean a party to arbitration for reference.       It has been

further observed that it does not appear that there exists a similar provision

in the <a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_123">Punjab Act</a>. It has been also observed that the dispute and differences

between the society and an employee are preferable to arbitration in terms

of Section 102 of the Haryana Act and an appeal is maintainable against an

award of the Arbitrator before the State Government. On this ground alone,

the revision petition filed by the 3rd respondent was not maintainable. It

appears that the amendments made in Sections 102 and 115 of the Haryana

Act vide Haryana Co-operative Societies (Amendment) Act, 2006 were not

brought to the notice of the Hon'ble Supreme Court which clearly indicates

that the dispute relating to service matters in respect of the paid servant of

the society cannot be referred to arbitration.

</p><p id="p_76">            The aforesaid provisions and the judgments were not brought to

the notice of the Hon'ble Supreme Court at the time of hearing of Shahabad

Cooperative Sugar Mills case (supra). It was purely on account of that an

observation was made that the dispute and differences between the society

and the employee are referable to an arbitrator under the Haryana Act as

well as under the <a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_147">Punjab Act</a> and since the employee did not invoke the

arbitration proceedings, he could not have maintained a revision,

particularly when against the award an appeal lies before the State

Government. It was held that if an appeal lies, a revision would not lie and

the State Government cannot exercise its revisional jurisdiction. It means

the revision does not lie if an appeal lies before the Government under

<a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_148">Section 68</a> of the Punjab Act or Section 114 of the Haryana Act. It is

pertinent to mention here that in these two provisions no appeal has been

provided against the order passed by the Registrar or the Deputy Registrar,

exercising the powers of the Appellate Authority under the Statutory Service

Rules. Therefore, against such an order it cannot be said that an appeal lies

under <a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_149">Section 68</a> of the Punjab Act or under Section 114 of the Haryana Act.

In our opinion, an aggrieved party cannot maintain a revision under <a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_150">Section

69</a> of the Punjab Act or under Section 115 of the Haryana Act, if against the

impugned order an appeal is maintainable under <a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_151">Section 68</a> of the Punjab

Act or under Section 114 of the Haryana Act. Even the State Government or

the Registrar cannot exercise its suo motu power to modify an order against

which an appeal lies under <a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_152">Section 68</a> of the Punjab Act or under Section

114 of the Haryana Act. <a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_153">Section 69</a> of the Punjab Act clearly stipulates that

the State Government and the Registrar may suo motu or on an application

of a party to a reference can exercise the revisional jurisdiction to call for

the record of any proceeding to examine the legality and propriety of any

decision or order against which no appeal lies under <a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_154">Section 68</a> of the

Punjab Act to the Government. Similarly under Section 115 of the Haryana

Act, it has been provided that the Government can exercise the revisional

jurisdiction only in a case where against the impugned action no appeal

under <a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_155">Section 114</a> lies to the Government. Both the provisions specifically

provide for the appeals under <a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_156">Section 68</a> of the Punjab Act and under

Section 114 of the Haryana Act. These provisions do not refer to any appeal

provided under the Service Rules or under any other rules. A perusal of

<a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_157">Section 68</a> of the Punjab Act and Section 114 of the Haryana Act reveals

that   against    various    orders    passed     by    the    Registrar,Deputy

Registrar,Additional Registrar, Arbitrator or the Society, the remedy of

appeal has been provided, but in none of the sub-clauses, the remedy of

appeal against the order of termination of services by the Society or against

the order passed by the Appellate Authority under the Service Rules, has

been provided. Therefore, it is the correct legal position that if an appeal lies

under <a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_158">Section 68</a> of the Punjab Act and under Section 114 of the Haryana

Act, the revision under <a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_159">Section 69</a> of the Punjab Act and under Section 115

of the Haryana Act would not lie, and if the revision is not maintainable,

suo motu power could not also be exercised by the State Government.

Act which provides for revision is slightly different.        Initially in that

provision, a party to the reference under <a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_162">Section 102</a> has been mentioned,

whereas in <a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_163">Punjab Act</a> under <a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_164">Section 55</a> the same has not been mentioned,

but the word `reference ' used in the said section only refers to <a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_165">Section 55</a> of

the Punjab Act. In Haryana Act, by an amendment made in Section 115 of

the Haryana Act by the Haryana Co-operative Societies (Amendment) Act,

2006, the words "a party to a reference under <a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_166">Section 102</a>" have been

substituted with words "an aggrieved party" and after the words "of any

proceedings", the words "under this Act and the rules framed there-under"

have been inserted. Actually the amendment made in the Haryana Act is

explanatory. Now in Haryana any aggrieved party can challenge an order in

revision passed by an authority under the Act and the Rules framed

thereunder provided against that order no appeal lies under Section 114 of

the Haryana Act. The Government either suo motu or on the application of

an aggrieved party can call for and examine the record of any proceeding

under the Act and the Rules framed thereunder for the purpose of satisfying

itself as to the legality, propriety or any decision and order passed and to

modify, annul or revise the said order, though after providing opportunity of

hearing to the aggrieved person. Now in Haryana, it is not restricted that

the revision could be initiated at the instance of a person who is party to the

reference under Section 102 of the Haryana Act. After the amendment any

aggrieved person against the order passed in any proceeding under the Act

and the Rules framed thereunder can challenge the said order, provided no

appeal lies against the said order under Section 114 of the Haryana Act.

Thus after the amendment made in Haryana in the year 2006, the restricted

view taken by Hardial Singh's case (supra) is not applicable at all. Under

Section 69 of the Punjab Act the Government or the Registrar may either

suo motu or on the application of a party to a reference call for and examine

the record of any proceedings in which no appeal under <a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_167">Section 68</a> lies to

the Government or the Registrar who after hearing the other side, may

modify, annul or revise the said decision or the order passed in those

proceeding.
</p>
<p id="p_78">              In our view, the State Government can exercise its suo motu

power of revision if any aggrieved party brings the matter to the notice of

the State Government by way of revision. In Everest Apartments' case

(supra) while taking into consideration Section 154 of the Maharashtra Co-

operative <a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_168">Societies Act</a>, 1960, which was pari materia to <a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_169">Section 69</a> of the

Punjab Act, it was held as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_70">               "It is, of course, true that the words "on an application of a
               party" which occur in<a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_170"> S. 150</a> of the Act and in similar
               enactments in other Acts, are also not to be found. But that
               does not mean that a party is prohibited from moving
               Government. As Government is not compelled to take action,
               unless it thinks fit, the party who moves Government cannot
               claim that he has a right of appeal or revision. On the other
               hand, Government should welcome such applications because
               they draw the attention of Government to cases in some of
               which, Government may be interested to intervene. In many
               statutes, as for example the two major procedural Codes,
               such language has not only not inhibited the making of
               applications to the High Court, but has been considered to
               give a right to obtain intervention, although the mere making

             of the application has not clothed a party with any rights
             beyond bringing a matter to the notice of the Court. After this
             is done, it is for the Court to consider whether to act or not.
             The extreme position does not obtain here because there is no
             right to interference in the same way as in a judicial
             proceeding. Government may act or may not act; the choice is
             of Government. There is no right to relief as in an appeal or
             revision under the two Codes. But to say that Government has
             no jurisdiction at all in the matter is to err, and that is what
             Government did in this case."</blockquote><p id="p_79">



</p><p id="p_80">            When in Gurnam Kaur's case (supra) an argument was raised

on the basis of decision rendered in Hardial Singh's case (supra) that a

revision which was not filed by the competent persons could not be

entertained even by invoking suo motu revisional power for setting aside the

order. The Division Bench doubted the correctness of the decision in

Hardial Singh's case (supra) and referred the matter to the Full Bench while

observing as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_71">            ".....It is rare that the revisional authority would come to know
            of the orders passed by the lower authority of its own. The
            occasion to the suo motu power can, therefore, arise only when
            an aggrieved person brings the order to the notice of the
            authorities. Also, there is nothing in the statute which debars
            an aggrieved person from moving the revisional authority to
            invoke its suo motu powers. the moment it is accepted that an
            aggrieved person can move for invoking the suo motu powers
            of the revisional authority, it would not matter whether it is
            stated in the order or not that suo motu powers are invoked for
            passing the order because it is well established that if there is
            power with the authority, the order passed can always be

             ascribed to it even though there is no mention that the same is
             being passed in exercise of that power."</blockquote><p id="p_81">



</p><p id="p_82">            The Full Bench of this Court in Gurnam Kaur's case (supra)

after due consideration to the respective arguments raised by the counsel for

the parties has held that the decision rendered in Hardial Singh's case

(supra) does not lay down the correct position of law with respect to

interpretation of <a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_171">Section 69</a> of the Punjab Act. It was held that the revisional

power as contemplated in <a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_172">Section 69</a> of the Punjab Act is to send for the

records of the case pending or decided by the Subordinate Authorities to

examine the same and to pass appropriate orders modifying, annulling or

reversing the same. Such power can be exercised when the Revisional

Authority comes to know about the legality or propriety of passing such

orders.   This knowledge can be acquired either at the instance of the

Revisional Authority itself or at the instance of aggrieved or interested

party. The opening words of <a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_173">Section 69</a> with respect to "suo motu" or "on

the application of a party to a reference" are explanatory in nature. They are

neither superfluous nor redundant. Even in the absence of specific

phraseology, the material context of the provision referred to above still

would clothe the Revisional Authority to exercise the power as would be

seen from such like provisions in different statutes. It is immaterial whether

the revisional power is exercised at the instance of interested party or suo

motu. This exercise of powers is not dependent on the action of the party

concerned. Even if the action was initiated by a party, who was not

aggrieved, in other words, not a person competent, the exercise of powers in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_52">               C.W.P. No.4922 of 1989                                -54-</span>

modifying, annulling or revising the order of the subordinate authority will

not be without jurisdiction. From the perusal of the judgments in Everest

Apartments Co-operative Housing Society's case (supra) and that of the

Privy Council in The Tribune Trust's case (supra), it is quite clear that action

to exercise the revisional jurisdiction could be initiated either by the party

concerned or by the authority of its own. Even if the party concerned moves

the revisional authority, it is left to the revisional authority to examine the

records and then to pass the appropriate order. Similar course could be

adopted even if the matter had come to the notice of the revisional authority

otherwise. The aforesaid two cases were noticed subsequently in The

Amritsar Central Co-operative Bank's case (supra) by the learned Single

Bench of this Court, but found himself bound by the ratio of the decision in

Hardial Singh's case (supra). In the light of the ratio laid down by the

aforesaid two judgments the view expressed in Hardial Singh's case (supra)

does not lay down the correct position of law.
</p>
<p id="p_83">             We fully concur with the aforesaid reasoning given by the Full

Bench in Gurnam Kaur's case (supra). In our view, the Government or the

Registrar, as the case may be, can exercise its revisional jurisdiction on the

application made by an aggrieved person whether he is or not a party to a

reference.

<p id="p_84">             In light of the above discussion, the legal position summed up

by the Division Bench of this Court in LPA No.1230 of 2009 (Sukhwant

Singh Vs. Deputy Registrar, Coop. Societies, Punjab, Chandigarh and

others) decided on January 22, 2010, requires some clarification. In para 13

of the said judgment, the Division Bench has summed up the legal position
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_53">               C.W.P. No.4922 of 1989                             -55-</span>

as under:-

             where revision is otherwise maintainable, as held by the
             Hon'ble Supreme Court in Shahabad Cooperative Sugar Mills
             (supra). Contrary view in decisions of this Court in Gurnam
             Kaur and Punjab Handloom(supra) cannot be followed;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_73">             ii) In view of (i), revisional jurisdiction can be only against

</p><p id="p_86">             The observation under clause (i) that `the width of suo motu

power under <a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_176">Section 69</a> is limited to cases where revision is otherwise

maintainable', is correct because in a case where an appeal under <a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_177">Section 68</a>

lies against the impugned order, then no revision is maintainable under

<a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_178">Section 69</a> of the Punjab Act and in that situation the revision cannot be

entertained, but these observations should not be understood that no

revision is maintainable at the instance of an aggrieved party who is not a

party to the reference under <a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_179">Section 55</a> of the Punjab Act or under Section

102 of the Haryana Act. It has been further observed therein that contrary

view taken in Gurnam Kaur's case and Punjab Handloom's case cannot be

followed. In our view, those two judgments do not contain any contrary

view as explained in the aforesaid discussion. Therefore, the view expressed

by the Division Bench that the `contrary view in decisions of this Court in

Gurnam Kaur and Punjab Handloom(supra) cannot be followed', does not

reflect the correct position of law.

revisional jurisdiction can be invoked only against an order passed in a

proceeding under the Act, particularly in a reference under <a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_180">Section 55</a> of the

Act, also requires some clarification. The words "particularly in a reference

under <a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_181">Section 55</a> of the Act" may not be taken to restrict the earlier

observation that the revisional jurisdiction can be invoked only against an

order passed in a proceeding under the Act as it has already been made clear

that the State Government or the Registrar, as the case may be, can exercise

its revisional jurisdiction on the application made by any aggrieved party

whether he is or not a party to the reference. Therefore, an order passed in a

proceeding under the Act, though not an order passed in a reference under

<a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_182">Section 55</a> of the Act, can be challenged by invoking the revisional

jurisdiction. Even in Sukhwant Singh's case (supra) the order under

challenge was an order of the Society and not an order made in a reference

under <a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_183">Section 55</a> of the Act. Therefore, the phrase "particularly in a

reference under <a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_184">Section 55</a> of the Act" found in clause (ii) is superfluous. As

far as the observation under clause (iii) is concerned, the legal position has

been correctly summed up. It is pertinent to mention here that in this case

only the issue, which has been summed up in clause (iii) was involved and

the other issues, which have been summed up in clause (i) and (ii) were not

the subject matter of the controversy in the said case.

Registrar bifurcating the Cheema Co-operative Agricultural Service Society

Limited into two Societies, namely, Cheema Co-operative Agricultural

Service Society Ltd. and Bhagupur Co-operative Agricultural Service

Society Ltd., has been set aside on the ground that the Registrar passed the

order of bifurcation of the parent Cheema Society without calling and

holding the general body meeting of the members of the Society and

considering the objections filed by some of the members. The petitioners

challenged the said order on the ground that against the order dated

30.10.1987 passed by the Assistant Registrar no revision was maintainable

under <a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_191">Section 69</a> of the Punjab Act and also on the ground that before

passing the order of compulsory bifurcation the general body meeting of the

parent society was duly called in which the matter of bifurcation of the

society was considered and the objections filed by the members of the

society were also duly considered by the Registrar.
</p>
<p id="p_97">            After hearing the learned counsel for the parties and going

through the impugned order, we find that the revisional authority has rightly

entertained the revision petition against the order dated 30.10.1987 passed

by the Registrar, Co-operative Societies, whereby the Cheema Co-operative

Agricultural Service Society Limited was compulsory bifurcated in exercise

of the powers under <a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_192">Section 13(8)</a> of the Act. It has already been held by us

that an order of compulsory bifurcation passed by the Registrar under

<a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_193">Section 13(8)</a> of the Act, against which no appeal has been provided under

<a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_194">Section 68</a> of the Punjab Act, is revisable on an application filed by the

aggrieved party under <a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_195">Section 69</a> of the Punjab Act. Therefore, there is no

force in the submission of the learned counsel for the petitioners that the

order dated 24.8.1988 passed by the Government was without jurisdiction.

Secondly, on the merits of the case, the revisional authority had called for

the records of the case and after perusing the same, recorded a finding of

fact that no meeting of the general body was called to consider the notice

given by the Registrar for compulsory bifurcation of the Society. It was

further recorded as a finding of fact that the objections which were

forwarded to the Assistant Registrar by some of the members, were not

considered and decided, though it was wrongly recorded in the impugned

order that such objections were duly considered. It has not been disputed

that under <a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_196">Section 13(8)</a> of the Act when the Registrar proposed to bifurcate

a Co-operative Society into two or more societies, he is required to send a

copy of the proposed order to the society and its creditors concerned, and

then after receiving the objections from the society or any member or the

creditors of such society, within the specified time, pass the order. He can

modify the proposed order after considering the objections invited under

sub-section (9) of <a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_197">Section 13</a> of the Punjab Act.
</p>
<p id="p_98">            In the present case, the general body meeting of the Society was

not called but the Assistant Registrar, exercising the powers of the Registrar,

asked the Secretary of the parent Society to convene the general body

meeting and to file the objections, if any, against the proposed bifurcation

within thirty days. But the general body meeting was not convened. No

material has been placed to establish that such finding of fact recorded by

the revisional authority is perverse or contrary to the record. In absence of

any such material, this Court in writ jurisdiction cannot interfere in the

finding of fact recorded by the Revisional Authority. Thus, we are not

inclined to interfere in this petition either on merits of the case or on the

issue of maintainability of the revision petition and the same is hereby

dismissed.

<p id="p_99">      (ii)    CWP No.14997 of 1989 has been filed against the order dated

21.8.1989 passed by the Government, whereby the revision petition filed by

the petitioner under Section 115 of the Haryana Act against the order dated

23.1.1989 passed by the Registrar, Co-operative Societies, was dismissed

being not maintainable. Against his dismissal order, the petitioner filed an

appeal before the Registrar, Co-operative Societies under the Common

Cadre Rules. As already held, if an order has been passed by the Registrar,

exercising the powers of the Appellate Authority under the Statutory Rules

or Common Cadre Rules, a revision against such an order is maintainable.

In the present case, the revision filed by the petitioner against the said order

was dismissed by the Government being not maintainable. Therefore, the

writ petition is allowed and the impugned order dated 21.8.1989 is set aside

by an authority in a proceeding arising under the Act. The petitioner is

challenging the inaction of the society by not deciding his representation. As

already held, no revision against the action or inaction of the society is

maintainable under <a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_199">Section 69</a> of the Punjab Act. Hence, this writ petition is

liable to be dismissed and the same is hereby dismissed as the Registrar has

rightly dismissed the revision petition filed by the petitioner being not

maintainable.</p><pre id="pre_2">
