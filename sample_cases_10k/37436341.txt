Present: Mr. Naresh Chander, Advocate
         for the petitioners.

<p id="p_1">RAJ MOHAN SINGH, J.(Oral)

           In this petition, petitioners have prayed for issuance

of necessary directions to the official respondents to protect

their lives and personal liberties from being invaded by the

private respondents. Petitioners claimed themselves to be major

and have contacted marriage on 17.04.2017 according to their

own sweet will, but against the wishes of their family members.

Marriage Certificate (Annexure P-3) and Photographs of

Marriage (Annexure P-4) are sought to be pressed into service

in order to project validity of marriage.
</p>
<p id="p_2">           In the context of threat perception at the hands of

private respondents, petitioners have prayed for necessary

directions for safeguarding their personal civil and legal rights.

In the aforesaid context, petitioners have allegedly moved

representation dated 17.04.2017 (Annexure P-5) to Senior

Superintendent of Police, Amritsar.
</p>
<p id="p_4">          Notice of motion to respondents No.1 to 3.
</p>
<p id="p_5">          On the asking of the Court, Mr. P.S. Ghuman,

Additional A.G, Punjab accepts notice on behalf of State-

respondents No.1 to 3.
</p>
<p id="p_6">          At this juncture, this Court is not in a position to

comment upon the validity of marriage and majority of the

petitioners in terms of their respective ages, however,

respondent No.2 can be asked to have a fair look on the

grievance of the petitioners in order to ascertain veracity of

allegations made by the petitioners. Respondent No.2 would be

at liberty to devise his/her own mechanism to ascertain the

truth. He/she would also be at liberty to join the petitioners or

any other person acquainted with facts in issue. In case

respondent No.2 finds that there is some truth in the allegations

of the petitioners, then he/she shall proceed to take appropriate

action in accordance with law.
</p>
<p id="p_7">          The aforesaid order is being passed at this stage

without meaning anything on the merits of the case.

Respondent No.2 would pass necessary order without being

influenced by any observation made by the Court in terms of

pleadings at this stage. This order shall not debar the official

respondents from proceeding against any of the party in

accordance with law in case they are involved in some other

case. It would be appreciated if the representation filed by the

petitioners is decided within a period of one month from today

keeping in view the threat perception shown by the petitioners.
