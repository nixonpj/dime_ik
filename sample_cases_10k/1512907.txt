Case :- SPECIAL APPEAL No. - 1134 of 2010

Petitioner :- C/M, Shri Shiv Inter College Thru' Manager &amp; Another
Respondent :- Uma Shankar Misra &amp; Others
Petitioner Counsel :- Anil Bhushan,S.M. Yadav
Respondent Counsel :- C.S.C.,J.N. Maurya,R. Misra

Hon'ble Ferdino Inacio Rebello,Chief Justice
Hon'ble Amreshwar Pratap Sahi,J.
</pre>
<p id="p_1">The management is in appeal against the interim order passed by the
learned Single Judge dated 17.6.2010. The writ petition is pending
before the learned Single Judge.
</p>
<p id="p_2">Considering the short controversy involved learned counsel for the
parties are agreed that the writ petition itself be disposed of as it raises
pure questions of law.
</p>
<p id="p_3">The petitioner was working as a lecturer and is now holding the post of
adhoc Principal.The petitioner was born on 17.12.1949 and he had
initially submitted his option to retire at the age of 58 years.
Subsequently in terms of the government order dated 17.2.99 read with
government order dated 4.2.2004 the petitioner submitted a fresh option
proposing to retire at the age of 62 years.
</p>
<p id="p_4">The age of retirement previously was 60 years with an option to retire at
the age of 58 years with the benefit of gratuity.
</p>
<p id="p_5">The earlier option was sought some time in 1982 in which respondent
no.1 opted to retire at the age of 58 years. The State Government
thereafter issued another notification on 17.2.1999 under which the
option could be given at any time before one year of the age of
retirement . The 1999 notification was subject matter of the Full Bench
judgment of this Court in Prabha Kakkar Vs. Joint Director of Education
Kanpur and others reported in (2000)2 UPLBEC 1378.
</p>
<p id="p_6">On 4.2.2004 the State Government issued another notification by which
the age of retirement has been enhanced from 58 to 60 years for those
who opted for gratuity and from 60 to 62 years for those who did not opt
for gratuity. In para 4 of the government order dated 4.2.2004 it is stated
that in this regard the other terms and conditions which were earlier
existing shall continue.
</p><p id="p_7"> In the instant case the petitioner would ordinarily have retired on
17.12.2007 at the age of 58 years. However, on account of the 2004
notification the age of retirement was extended to 17.12.2009. The
petitioner on 30.11.2008 exercised his option to retire at the age of 62
years. This application was considered by the management in its
meeting on 4.1.2009. Thereafter the same was communicated to the
concerned authorities who have returned the matter back to the
management for better details.
</p>
<p id="p_8">The petitioner would have retired in view of the government order of the
2004 on 17.12.2009. He exercised his option on 30.11.2008. In view of
this background of the case the issue needs to be considered.
</p>
<p id="p_9">The position thus would be that a teacher or Principal can exercise the
option one year before the age of retirement as the case may be. Once
the application is made within the time frame there would be no
occassion for the authorities to reject the same. In the instant case the
application was moved within time. With the benefit of the enhanced
age of retirement under the government order dated 4.2.2004 that was
available, the option was rightly exercised on 30.11.2008 within the time
frame contained in the government order dated 17.2.1999. Learned
counsel for the appellant points out that the respondent no.1 continues
to be in service and is getting salary of the post.
</p>
<p id="p_10">The respondent no.3 is therefore directed to consider the same in the
light of the observations made herein above and pass an appropriate
order within a period of two months. In the meantime the respondent
no.1 shall continue to hold the post which he was holding.
</p>
<p id="p_11">With the aforesaid observations, the special appeal is disposed of.
Accordingly the writ petition also stands disposed of.
</p>
<p id="p_12">A copy of this order be placed in the record of the writ petition.
</p>


<p id="p_13">                                                (A.P.Sahi,J) (F.I.Rebello,CJ)
