case, cognizance of the offence punishable under <a href="/doc/324254/" id="a_3">Section 7</a>
of the Act has been taken against petitioners namely Rajesh
Dubey and Govind Prasad Shrivas upon the charge-sheet
submitted   by   Inspector-SPE          (Lokayukta),   Jabalpur   on
13/7/2009, after due investigation into the complaint made
by A.K. Tripathi, the respondent no.2, in both the MCrCs
and forwarded by Special Judge, under <a href="/doc/99487/" id="a_4">Section 156(3)</a> of
the Code, to Superintendent of Police, SPE (Lokayukta),
Jabalpur for investigation.

before the Special Judge on 25.09.2008. It contained the
following allegations -
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">            "High Court of Madhya Pradesh had invited
     applications    from     practicing         lawyers        for   direct
     recruitment to the Higher Judicial Services of M.P.
     and last date for receipt of applications was fixed as
     12.09.2008. Being interested in applying for the
     same, the complainant had moved an application
     for issuance of a domicile certificate in the office of
     Tahsildar at Lakhnadaun nearly 7 days prior to the
     incident in question. Although, as per the standing
     guidelines issued by the Collector of the District,
     the certificate ought to have been issued on the
     date of filing of the application yet, Govind, the
     Reader, continued to avoid acceptance of the
     application on the pretext that the Tahsildar was
     busy    in   election    work.         Ultimately,        it   was   on
     10.09.2008 that Govind received the application
     and    asked    the     complainant           to     come       on   the
     following    day     at 4     p.m.       However,          when the
     complainant     reached        the      office       to   collect    the
     certificate, Govind returned the application saying
     that it was not possible to issue the same for two
     reasons, - firstly, he was not born in the State of
     M.P.   and     secondly,       the       application           was   not
     otherwise complete. The complainant still asserted
     that the application was complete in all respects
     and the requisite fee of Rs.20/- had already been
     deposited by him but at this juncture, Govind
     reminded him that like any other applicant desirous
     of getting the domicile certificate issued on the
                                :: 4 ::
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">                          MCrC Nos.7892/09 &amp;11903/09




     same day, the complainant was also required to
     pay a sum of Rs.500/- as illegal gratification. In
     turn, he refused to pay any amount as bribe. This
     led to an altercation that attracted attention of
     persons present in and around the office. Rajesh
     also arrived there but, on being apprised of the root
     cause of quarrel, insisted for fulfillment of the
     requirement as pointed out by Govind. Gathering
     support and activation from Rajesh, his controlling
     officer; Govind turned violent and while hurling
     abuses, not only tore the application and the
     documents annexed thereto but also threw the
     same at the complainant's face saying that "see
     that the certificate has been prepared".
</blockquote>
<p id="p_7">5.   Thus, according to the complainant, the domicile
certificate was not issued solely because the demand for a
sum of Rs.500/- as an illegal gratification was not satisfied.
</p>
<p id="p_8">6.   Shri    Surendra     Singh,         learned       Senior   Counsel
appearing   on   behalf   of   petitioner         Rajesh   Dubey   has
strenuously contended that his prosecution is an abuse of
the process of the Court in view of the following facts -
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">     (i)    The complainant, who has not only served as
            Civil Judge for a considerable period of 9 years
            but has also practiced at the Bar, was expected
            to know that (a) under the relevant rules, he
            was not entitled to get Domicile Certificate and
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">            (b) in the wake of his removal from the post of
            Civil Judge, he was disqualified for appointment
            to the Higher Judicial Services.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">                                      :: 5 ::
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_6">                                MCrC Nos.7892/09 &amp;11903/09




</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_7">     (ii)     There was not even an iota of evidence to
              indicate that Rajesh had ever demanded any
              illegal gratification from the complainant for the
              purpose.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_8">     (iii)    The complaint was made with a view to wreaking
              vengeance by the complainant, who stands
              prosecuted for the offences punishable under
              <a href="/doc/488479/" id="a_8">Sections 186</a>, <a href="/doc/1208971/" id="a_9">353</a>, <a href="/doc/594493/" id="a_10">294</a> and <a href="/doc/180217/" id="a_11">506</a> of the IPC upon
              the FIR lodged by Govind at P.S. Lakhnadaun on
              11.09.2008 at 5.30 p.m.

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_9">     (iv) Allegations levelled against the petitioners are
              patently absurd as it is inconceivable that any
              demand for bribe would be made at a public
              place in presence of the crowd.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_10">     (v)      A considerable delay of 14 days was sufficient to
              conclusively establish falsity of the complaint
              particularly in view of the fact that being well
              versed with law; the complainant was expected
              to    understand          significance           of     a    prompt
              complaint.
</blockquote>

<p id="p_9">7. Adopting        the   same     line         of   arguments,         Shri    G.S.
  Alhuwalia,        Advocate        appearing            for        Govind,        has
  highlighted the misconduct for which the services of the
  complainant as Civil Judge were terminated. According to
  him,       apparently,    the      complaint           was        made      as    a
  counterblast to the registration of criminal case against
  the complainant upon a promptly lodged FIR reflecting
  that -
</p>                               :: 6 ::
<p id="p_10">                         MCrC Nos.7892/09 &amp;11903/09




           On 11.09.2008 at about 4:40 p.m., in the
     wake of the objection that his application was
     not entertainable as he was not a bona fide
     resident of State of Madhya Pradesh by birth, the
     complainant, being infuriated, caught hold of
     collar of Govind's shirt and as his fellow officials
     came forward to intervene, tore the documents
     lying on his table and gave a fist blow resulting
     into injuries on lips and neck.
</p>
<p id="p_11">     He is further of the view that absence of any plausible
explanation as to why the complainant had not reported the
matter directly to the S.P. (Lokayukta) for a considerable
period of time, was sufficient to doubt veracity of the
complaint. Our attention has also been invited to the fact
that Investigating Officer had not been able to seize any
receipt evidencing deposit of Rs.20/- as the requisite fee or
carbon copy thereof.
</p>
<p id="p_12">8.   In response, learned Special Public Prosecutor has
submitted that the defences raised by the petitioners would
require inquiry into the facts and can not be considered at
the preliminary stage for the purpose of quashing the
proceedings initiated on the basis of the complaint. Placing
reliance on the decision of the Apex Court in <a href="/doc/1429052/" id="a_12">State of
Orissa v. Saroj Kumar Sahoo</a> (2005) 13 SCC 540, he
has further contended that the allegations of mala fides
against the petitioners are inconsequent and cannot, by
themselves, be the basis to stifle a legitimate prosecution.
</p><p id="p_13">                                   :: 7 ::
</p><p id="p_14">                             MCrC Nos.7892/09 &amp;11903/09




</p><p id="p_15">9.    At the outset, it may be observed that particulars of
misconduct      forming     foundation        of    the     termination       of
complainant's services have hardly any relevance to the
issues involved in these petitions. Moreover, we do not
propose to go into the question as to whether on the date
of the alleged occurrence, the complainant was entitled to
grant of domicile certificate.
</p>
<p id="p_16">10.   A brief perusal of the chronology of events leading to
lodging of complaint, allegations made therein and counter
allegations as contained in the FIR lodged by Govind, would
reveal that on 11.09.2008 around 4.30 p.m., a quarrel had
ensued in the office of Tahsildar at Lakhnadaun upon
Govind's disinclination to process the application of the
complainant for issuance of domicile certificate and in the
course of the quarrel, certain documents were torn and
pieces thereof were seized in criminal case registered as
Crime No.202/2008 against the complainant in respect of
the offences punishable under <a href="/doc/488479/" id="a_13">Section 186</a>, <a href="/doc/1208971/" id="a_14">353</a>, <a href="/doc/594493/" id="a_15">294</a> and
<a href="/doc/180217/" id="a_16">506</a> of the IPC. However, as indicated by the Deputy
Collector, Seoni in the letter-dated 23.01.2009 addressed to
Officer-In-Charge      of   Finance         Section       (that    has      been
annexed    to   the    charge     sheet       submitted           against    the
petitioners), no complaint as to the alleged misconduct of
Govind and connivance of Rajesh was made to the Collector
of the District.      This apart, the complaint is completely
silent on the point as to whether the complainant had laid
the information about the occurrence before the SHO of
P.S. Lakhnadaun or any officer of SPE (Lokayutka) at any
earlier point of time.
</p><p id="p_17">                                 :: 8 ::
</p><p id="p_18">                           MCrC Nos.7892/09 &amp;11903/09




</p><p id="p_19">11.   The   complainant,    being         a   former      Judge   and   a
practicing Advocate, was certainly expected to be well
versed with the legal position, as explained in Khedu
Mohton v State of Bihar AIR 1971 SC 66, that delay in
filing the complaint throws a great deal of doubt on the
prosecution story. A delay would be insignificant only when
there is no motive for false implication or where the
complainant has been able to offer a plausible explanation
for it. However, mere statement that police did not take
action can hardly be taken to have explained the delay in
making complaint (See. <a href="/doc/919369/" id="a_17">Dilawar Singh v. State of Delhi</a>
AIR 2007 SC 3234).
</p>
<p id="p_20">12.   Adverting to the facts of the case, it can easily be
concluded that the complaint was made with mala fide
motive as a counter blast to registration of the criminal
case against the complainant, after a considerable delay of
14 days. Allegations made in the complaint suggesting that
Govind was impliedly encouraged by Rajesh to openly
demand bribe in a public office were so patently absurd and
inherently improbable that no prudent person can ever
reach a conclusion that there is sufficient ground for
proceeding against the accused persons. As pointed out
already, the complainant had not preferred to inform legally
competent    authority   viz.     Special        Police   Establishment
(Lokayukta) about the misdemeanour of the petitioners as
public servants. It is well settled that -

Kumar Srivastav</a> AIR 2010 SC 201, while quashing the
criminal proceedings against Bank Manager and Officers
initiated upon a complaint made by one of the guarantors
against whom action had already been taken by the Bank
Officers for cheating and misappropriation of hypothecated
goods in the wake of default in re-payment of Bank loan by
borrower, the Supreme Court has reiterated the following
guidelines -

<blockquote id="blockquote_13">            ".... the High Court cannot refuse to exercise
      its jurisdiction if the interest of justice so required
      where the allegations made in the FIR or
      complaint      are    so    absurd    and    inherently
      improbable on the basis of which no fair-minded
      and informed observer can ever reach a just and
      proper conclusion as to the existence of sufficient
      grounds for proceeding. In such cases refusal to
      exercise the jurisdiction may equally result in
      injustice more particularly in cases where the
      complainant sets the criminal law in motion with a
      view to exert pressure and harass the persons
      arrayed as accused in the complaint. It is well
      settled and needs no restatement that the saving
      of inherent power of the High Court in criminal-
      matters is intended to achieve a salutary public
      purpose "which is that a court proceeding ought
      not to be permitted to degenerate into a weapon
      of harassment or persecution. If such power is not
      conceded, it may even lead to injustice".

explaining nature, scope and purpose of <a href="/doc/903398/" id="a_20">Section 482</a> of the
Code, the Apex Court has only sounded a note of caution
that inherent power is to be exercised sparingly, ex debito
justitiae to do real and substantial justice and that too in
the rarest of rare cases.
</p>
<p id="p_24">15.   Applying these principles to the factual scenario
highlighted above, we are of the considered opinion that the
present case is one of the rarest of rare cases that requires
our interference to secure the ends of justice as the
continuance of prosecution would amount to abuse of the
process of the Court. Needless to say that case of the
petitioners falls within category nos.(5) and (7) of the cases
as enumerated in <a href="/doc/1033637/" id="a_21">State of Haryana v. Bhajan Lal</a> AIR
