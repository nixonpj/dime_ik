<p id="p_20">   My findings on various issues are as under :-
</p>

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                ISSUE NO. 1</span>
<p id="p_21">   10.          The present petition is under <a href="/doc/136948773/" id="a_5">Section 166</a> of M.V. Act and as
   such, it was the duty of the petitioner to prove that the respondent No.1
   was rash and negligent in driving the vehicle at the time of accident.
</p>

<p id="p_22">   11.          The police has filed the Detailed Accident Report (DAR) on
   record pertaining to the case FIR no. 502/14 PS Kashmere Gate u/s
   279/338 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_6">IPC</a> including charge-sheet etc.


</p><p id="p_23">   12.              The petitioner appeared in the witness box and deposed that
   on 15.12.2014, at about 10:00 p.m., he was going from Ranjit Nagar


Suit No. 56914/16         Abhishek Choudhary Vs. Sachin &amp; Anr.   Page No. 6/15
    towards ISBT, Kashmere Gate, while travelling on the scooter bearing no.
   DL1SD7996 along with his friend, who was pillion rider. He deposed that
   they were going to ISBT Kashmere Gate for receiving one of their friends
   and when they reached at U-Turn, ISBT, then all of a sudden, a car
   bearing no. UP-16CT-0081, which was being driven by respondent no. 1
   came from the wrong side at a very high speed, in a rash and negligent
   manner and in violation of the traffic rules and struck against the said
   scooter from the front side with forceful impact. As a result of which, both
   the scooterists fell down on the road along with the scooter and received
   grievous injuries. PW-1 was cross examined by Ld. Counsels for
   Respondents No.1 and 2 but nothing fruitful came out and the cross-
   examination carried on by the respondents No. 1 &amp; 2 is not suggestive of
   anything which may discard the claim of the petitioner to the effect that
   the driver of the offending vehicle was not rash and negligent at the time
   of accident.
</p>

<p id="p_24">   13.          PW3 Sh. Bittoo Singh is the eye witness to the accident, who
   deposed that on 05.12.2014, he along with his friend Sh. Abhishek
   Chaudhary were going from Ranjit Nagar towards ISBT, Kashmere Gate,
   Delhi, on a two wheeler scooter bearing registration no. DL-11SD-7996,
   which was being driven by his above named friends. He was sitting on
   the back seat of the Scooter. He deposed that they were going to ISBT,
   Kashmere Gate, Delhi, for receiving one of their friends and when they
   reached at U-Turn, Near ISBT Kashmere Gate, Delhi, then all of a
   sudden, a car bearing registration no. UP-16-CT-0081, which was being
   driven by the respondent no. 1, came from the wrong side, at a very high
   speed, in rash and negligent manner and also in violation of traffic rules
   and norms and struck against the said scooter from front side/head on,
   with forceful impact, as a result of which, he and his above named friend


Suit No. 56914/16      Abhishek Choudhary Vs. Sachin &amp; Anr.   Page No. 7/15
    fell on the road along with the scooter and resulting thereby his friend
   Sh. Abhishek Chaudhary suffered grievous injuries and he fell               at a
   distance and suffered minor injuries. He deposed that after causing the
   aforesaid accident, respondent no. 1 i.e. driver of the said car parked his
   vehicle on the side of the road and came to them and he noted down the
   registration number of the said vehicle / car. So many persons gathered
   over there at that time and by taking benefit of the situation, the driver of
   the said car fled away along with his car from the place of incident.
</p><p id="p_25">                This witness was cross-examined by both the respondents,
   but nothing fruitful came out for the respondents.
</p>

<p id="p_26">   14.          Not only this, the Respondent No. 1 namely Sachin (accused
   in the State case) has been charge sheeted for offences punishable U/s
   279/338 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_7">IPC</a> by the investigating agency after arriving at the conclusion
   on the basis of investigation carried out by it that the accident in question
   had occurred due to rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle i.e.
   CAR bearing no. UP-16CT-0081 by him. Same would also point out
   towards rash and negligent driving of CAR bearing no. UP-16CT-0081 by
   respondent no.1.
</p>

<p id="p_27">   15.          While determining the negligence of the driver of the offending
   vehicle, I am being guided by the judgment of Hon'ble High Court of Delhi
   in 2009 ACJ 287, National Insurance Company Limited Vs. Pushpa
   Rana wherein in the Hon'ble High Court held that in case the petitioner
   files the certified copy of the criminal record or the criminal record showing
   the completion of the investigation by the police or the issuance of charge
   sheet under <a href="/doc/1270101/" id="a_8">section 279</a>/<a href="/doc/409589/" id="a_9">304</a> A IPC or the certified copy of the FIR or in
   addition the recovery memo on the mechanical inspection report of the




Suit No. 56914/16      Abhishek Choudhary Vs. Sachin &amp; Anr.    Page No. 8/15
    offending vehicle, these documents are sufficient proof to reach to the
   conclusion that the driver was negligent.           It was further held that the
   proceedings under the <a href="/doc/785258/" id="a_10">Motor Vehicles Act</a> are not akin to the proceedings
   in a civil suit and hence strict rules of evidence are not required to be
   followed in this regard. Further, in Kaushnumma Begum and others v/s
   New India Assurance Company Limited, 2001 ACJ 421 SC the issue of
   wrongful act or omission on the part of driver of the motor vehicle involved
   in the accident has been left to a secondary importance and mere use or
   involvement of motor vehicle in causing bodily injuries or death to a human
   being or damage to property would made the petition maintainable under
   <a href="/doc/136948773/" id="a_11">section 166</a> and <a href="/doc/32775809/" id="a_12">140</a> of the Act.
</p>

<p id="p_28">   16.          It is also settled law that the term rashness and negligence has
   to be construed lightly while making a decision on a petition for claim for
   the same as compared to the word rashness and negligence as                     finds
   mention in<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_13"> the Indian Penal Code</a>. This is because the chapter in the
   <a href="/doc/785258/" id="a_14">Motor Vehicle Act</a> dealing with compensation is a benevolent legislation
   and not a penal one.
</p>

<p id="p_29">   17.          Further the Hon'ble High of Delhi in MAC App. No.200/2012
   in case titled as United India Insurance Co. Ltd. Vd. Smt. Rinki @
   Rinku &amp; Ors decided on 23/07/2012 by Hon'ble High Court of Delhi held
   as under:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_4">                    "The Claims Tribunal was conscious of the fact that
                    negligence is a sine qua non to a Petition under

                    Act). It is also true that the proceedings for grant
                    of compensation under the Act are neither
                    governed by the criminal procedures nor are a civil
                    suit. A reference may be made to a judgment of

<blockquote id="blockquote_5">                    "15. In a situation of this nature, the Tribunal has
                    rightly taken a holistic view of the matter. It was
                    necessary to be borne in mind that strict proof of
                    any accident caused by a particular bus in a
                    particular manner may not be possible to be done
                    by the claimant. The claimants were merely to
                    establish   their   case   on   the   touchstone    of
                    preponderance of probability. The standard of
                    proof beyond reasonable doubt could not have
                    been applied."

<p id="p_30">   18.          Therefore, after considering all the documentary as well as

<p id="p_31">   19.          The issue no. 1, therefore, is decided in favour of the

         BILLS:

   suffered POLY TRAUMA WITH HEAD INJURY WITH MULTIPLE FACIAL
   BONE FRACTURE WITH BILATERAL HEMOTHORAX. The total bill of

    3,00,000/- out of the said amount. Besides this petitioner has filed the
   medical bills to tune of Rs. 90,357/-. Therefore, I hereby award a sum of

<p id="p_36">   21.          PAIN AND SUFFERINGS :
</p><p id="p_37">                It is settled law that a particular amount can not be fixed for
   pain and sufferings in all the cases and it varies from case to case.
   Judicial notice can be taken to the fact that since the petitioner had got
   injuries as aforesaid,       he might have suffered acute pain and sufferings
   owing to the said injuries. He might have also to take heavy dose of anti-
   biotic etc. and also might have remained without movements of his body
   for a considerable period of time.             In order to ascertain the pain and
   sufferings compensation, I am guided by the judgment of Hon'ble High
   Court of Delhi in case Satya Narain v/s Jai Kishan , FAO No: 709/02,
   date of decision: 2.2.2007, Delhi High Court by Hon'ble Mr. Justice
   Pradeep Nandrajog wherein it was held that:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_6">                "On account of pain and suffering, suffice would it be to
                note that it is difficult to measure pain and suffering in
                terms of a money value. However, compensation which
                has to be paid must bear some objectives co-relation
                with the pain and suffering.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_7">                The objective facts relatable to pain and suffering would
                be:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_8">                (a) Nature of injury.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_9">                (b) Body part affected.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_10">                (c) Duration of the treatment."
</blockquote>


<p id="p_38">   22.          Keeping in view the said guidelines and keeping in view the
   aforesaid observation made by this court, I hereby allow Rs.40,000/-
   towards pain and sufferings and loss of amenities of life. Besides this, I
   hereby award a sum of Rs.25,000/- towards special diet and conveyance.

                The petitioner was stated to be working as Milk Seller and
   earning Rs. 20,000/- per month.          In this regard, he has filed his ITR
   pertaining to the year 2013-14 Ex.PW2/1. In this regard, PW2 Sh. Sunder
   Singh from the office of Superintendent, ITO, Delhi, has proved the ITR of
   the claimant for the year 2013-14 only but the date of accident is
   05.12.2014. The aforementioned ITR does not cover the relevant period of
   accident. More so, the petitioner has also not filed on record the ITRs for
   the relevant period I.e 2014-15. In these circumstances, the income of the
   petitioner can very well be assessed on the basis of the chart available in
   the <a href="/doc/142278/" id="a_16">Minimum Wages Act</a>. The date of accident was 05.12.2014.
</p><p id="p_41">                Keeping in view the nature of injuries, it appears to me that
   petitioner could not have worked for about 3 months on which the
   minimum wages for Matriculate Persons were Rs. 10,478/-. Keeping in
   view the nature of injuries, it appears to me that petitioner could not have
   worked for about 03 months.           Accordingly, I award Rs. 31,434/- (Rs.
   10,478 X 3) towards loss of income.
