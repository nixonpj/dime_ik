JUDGMENT.
</p>

<p id="p_4">             Plaintiff has filed this suit for recovery of Rs.3,45,740/- along
with interest.
</p><p id="p_5">             Defendant NO.1 is the company which hired the services of the
plaintiff as a consultant and the defendant No.2 is its director and defendant
NO.3 is its General Manager (HR &amp; Admn) . IT may be noted here that vide
order dated 11.09.09     this court held that defendant no's 2&amp;3 are         not
necessary parties to the suit and , therefore, their names were deleted from
the array of the parties. The suit thereafter proceeded against defendant NO.1
company alone.
</p><p id="p_6">             Vide agreement dated 19.02.07, defendant No.1 company had
hired services of the plaintiff as a consultant for their project at the site of
their client in Madrid, Spain on the terms and conditions contained in the
said agreement. The agreement was valid for 12 months from the date of its
execution. Accordingly,a fresh contract was executed on 19.02.08 between
the parties whereby the services of the plaintiff were hired for further period
of 12 months from the aforesaid date . The terms and conditions in the
subsequent contract were almost identical with the first mentioned contract
except that the first mentioned contract mentioned that the monthly
charges payable to the plaintiff shall be fixed at Rs.1,25,000/- whereas the
subsequent contract mentioned that yearly charges payable to the plaintiff
were Rs.16,32,500/- during the tenure of the contract . It was provided in
both the contracts that the TDS as applicable shall be deducted from the
amount payable to the plaintiff.
</p><p id="p_7">             It appears that the defendant company deducted the amount of


Csno291/09
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                        3</span>

Rs.3,45,740/- from the dues payable to the plaintiff as withholding tax in
Spain. The deduction of the aforesaid amount as withholding tax is the bone
of contention between the parties and subject matter of the suit.
</p><p id="p_8">             The contention of the plaintiff is that he was never informed by
the defendant company at the time of execution of the consultancy contract
that he would be liable to pay withholding tax @ 24% on the income
received by him in Spain. It is his contention that he would not have entered
into consultancy contract with the defendant company, had he known that he
would be called upon to pay tax @ 24% on his income in Spain. He states
that he was surprised to receive e-mail dated 17.06.08 from the office of
the defendant company wherein he was informed for the first time about his
liability to pay withholding tax @24% on his total income in Spain. It may
be noted that plaintiff left the services of the defendant company in the
month of August, 2008 and returned to India. He is seeking recovery of the
aforesaid amount of Rs.3,45,740/- from the defendant company along with
interest. According to him, his outstanding dues with the defendant company
amounted to Rs.5,27,745/- but he was paid only a sum of Rs.1,82,005/-.
</p><p id="p_9">             The defence of the defendant NO.1 is based on the premise that
it was the statutory      liability of the defendant company to deduct
withholding tax from the amount payable to the plaintiff as his remuneration
. It is stated in the written statement that the plaintiff was liable to pay
withholding tax on the salary earned by him as he had agreed to the
concerned Spanish Authorities when he applied for work permit in Spain
that he would pay all the taxes applicable on his income during his work
tenure in Spain. IT is on account of the said agreement that the plaintiff was
granted work permit by Spanish Authorities . It is stated that all the taxes


Csno291/09
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                         4</span>



deducted from the salary of the        plaintiff have been deposited with the
concerned Spanish Govt. Authorities and the certificate for the same has
been issued to the plaintiff. It is also contended that plaintiff knew during his
tenure in Spain that he would be required to pay 24% withholding tax to
the Spanish Authorities on the income earned by him in Spain. IT is also
contended in the written statement that the present suit filed by the plaintiff is
a mere after thought as he has already issued a certificate dated 09.01.09
stating that nothing is due and payable by the defendant company towards
him .
</p><p id="p_10">             On these pleadings of the parties following issues were framed
by this court on 15.10.09 :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">             1      Whether the plaintiff is entitled to a decree in the
                    sum of Rs.3,45,740/- or any part thereof against
                    the defendants? OPP
             2      Whether the plaintiff is entitled to the interest if
                    so on what amount, at what rate and for what
                    period? OPP
             3      Relief.</blockquote>
<p id="p_11">             The plaintiff himself has entered in the witness box as PW-1 as
the only plaintiff witness in order to prove his case. ON the other hand, the
defendant company has examined Sh. Vijay Sehgal, its Manager as DW-1
in order to prove its case.
</p><p id="p_12">             I have heard ld. counsels for the parties and have perused the
record.
</p><p id="p_13">             My issue wise findings are as under:-

ISSUE NO.1.
</p><p id="p_15">             Whether the plaintiff is entitled to a decree in the sum of
             Rs.3,45,740/- or any part thereof against the defendants? OPP
             The ld. counsel for the plaintiff has submitted that the defendant
company had illegally deducted a sum of Rs.3,45,740/- from the dues of the
plaintiff as withholding tax. He has submitted that the plaintiff was not
liable to pay such tax and it was the responsibility of the defendant company
to pay such taxes on behalf of the plaintiff. He has referred to various clauses
of the consultancy agreements Ex.Pw1/A and Ex.PW1/2 to show that no
such liability is fixed upon the plaintiff in these consultancy agreements.
</p><p id="p_16">             Ld. counsel for the defendant on the other hand has submitted
that liability to pay any kind of tax on the income earned by the plaintiff
was upon the plaintiff only and the defendant company cannot be held liable
for the payment of such kind of tax.
</p><p id="p_17">             "Withholding tax" as it is called in Spain , is akin to advance
tax deduction at source(TDS) applicable in India . Spanish source income
from employment or other sources is subject to withholding of income tax.
The tax withheld is generally treated as an advance payment and credited
against the taxpayer's final tax liability. The withholder is under statutory
obligation to withhold and pay to the treasury the non residents' tax due .
</p><p id="p_18">             It is not the case of the plaintiff that levy of withholding tax @
24% was not      applicable on his earnings in Spain from the defendant
company. His contention is that such tax         was to be borne out by the
defendant company itself and could not have been deducted from his
earnings by the defendant company in Spain. His further contention is that
had he been aware that he would be called upon to pay withholding tax


Csno291/09
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                        6</span>

@24% on his income in Spain,he would not have entered in the consultancy
contract with the defendant company.
</p><p id="p_19">              As noted herein above, that withholding tax is income tax
deducted at source as per the laws of Spain. Clause 2 of the terms and
conditions contained in both the consultancy         contracts Ex.PW1/A and
Ex.PW12 mentions that TDS as applicable shall be deducted from the
amount paid to the consultant i e the plaintiff in the present case. Thus,
plaintiff cannot say that he was not aware that he was liable to pay income
tax or withholding tax on his income in Spain. Further, plaintiff in his cross
examination has fairly admitted that he was aware that income tax liability
for his contract with the defendant company was his personal liability. At
another place in the cross examination, he has admitted that he was aware of
the withholding tax liability but according to him it was not his liability. This
deposition of the plaintiff in the cross examination falsifies his own stand
that he was not aware at the time of entering into the contract with the
defendant company that he would be liable to pay withholding tax on his
earnings in Spain as per laws of Spain.
</p><p id="p_20">             No material has been placed on record by the plaintiff to show
that it was not his liability to pay withholding tax but the same rested with
the defendant company. Admittedly, after receipt of Rs.1,82,005/- from the
defendant company, he issued a certificate dated 09.01.09 stating that no
dues are payable to him by the defendant company. Certificate has been
proved on record by the plaintiff himself as E.x.Pw1/5. This amply shows
that plaintiff knew in his mind that he had to pay withholding tax on his
earnings in Spain and the defendant company has rightly deducted a sum of
Rs. 3,45,740/- from his dues. For otherwise, plaintiff would not have been


Csno291/09
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                         7</span>

issued such kind of unqualified and unconditional certificate . The plaintiff
has admitted in his cross examination that he issued this certificate on
09.01.09 in which he accepted that he has no dues against the defendant
company. He has also admitted in the cross examination that cheque in the
sum of Rs.1,82.005/- issued to him was duly encashed by him without any
demur. The plaintiff      has nowhere, either in his pleadings or in his
evidence,attempted to explain the circumstances in which he issued the
aforesaid certificate , if not after the receipt of full and final settled dues
from the defendant company. In absence of such explanation from the
plaintiff , the only logical conclusion which can be drawn is that plaintiff
knowingly issued the aforesaid certificate after receipt of Rs.1,82,005/- from
the defendant     company as full     and final settled amount and nothing
remained due      and outstanding from the defendant company            to him
thereafter.
</p><p id="p_21">              There has been no communication between the parties from
09.01.09 till 16.03.09 when the plaintiff got issued a legal notice to the
defendant company which has been proved as Ex.Pw1/6. Interestingly, this
legal notice does not mention anything regarding no dues certificate dated
09.01.09 issued by the plaintiff. This legal notice was duly replied by the
defendant company vide reply dated          16.04.09(Ex.PW1/9) denying any
liability towards the plaintiff. The plaintiff waited for a period of further
three months and filed a suit in the month of July,2009.
</p><p id="p_22">              It is therefore, apparent from the aforesaid discussion that the
claim put forward by the plaintiff in the suit is absolutely baseless,
concocted and motivated
              (Now it was submitted by the ld.counsel for the plaintiff that the


Csno291/09
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                       8</span>

defendant company has deposited only a sum of Rs.60,000/- as withholding
tax with the Spanish authorities and has illegally deducted Rs.3,45,740/-
from the dues of plaintiff on this account. He would submit that the plaintiff
is atleast entitled to the refund of excess amount deducted from his earnings
by the defendant company. The contention of the defendant company in this
regard is that it has deducted amount equivalent to Euro 3326.17 as
withholding tax from the dues of the plaintiff and deposited the same with
Spanish authorities. The witness of the defendant (DW-1) has reiterated the
same in para no.22 of his affidavit of evidence. There is           no cross
examination of this witness on his such deposition.
</p><p id="p_23">              No cross examination on material point amounts to admission
of the same. In this regard the Supreme Court in the case reported as
Rajinder Prasad Vs. Darshana Devi 2001(3)CivilCourt Cases 622 (SC)
observed as that the absence of cross examination on a point, the statement
on that point in examination in chief to be taken to be true. To impeach the
credit of a witness an opportunity must be given to him to explain his
statement by drawing his attention to that part of it which is objected to as
untrue, otherwise his credit cannot be impeached. The Delhi High Court in
the case reported as Sri Chand and Snhivan Das Vs. the state 28(1985)
DLT 360 observed that if there is no cross examination and the evidence of
witness is allowed to go unchallenged on particular point,then it may safely
be accepted as correct.
</p><p id="p_24">              Thus, the plaintiff shall betaken to have admitted that the
defendant company has deposited Euro 3326.17 with the Spanish authorities
as withholding tax after deducting the same from the earnings of the
plaintiff.)

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                          9</span>

             For the aforesaid reason, I hold that the plaintiff is not entitled
to any amount from the defendant company as claimed in the suit .
</p><p id="p_25">             The issue is , therefore, decided against the plaintiff and in
favour of the defendant company.
</p><p id="p_26">ISSUE NO.2.
</p><p id="p_27">              Whether the plaintiff is entitled to the interest if
              so on what amount, at what rate and for what
              period? OPP
             Since I have held herein above that plaintiff is not entitled to
any amount, as claimed in the suit, from the defendant company,therefore,
no question of interest arises.
</p><p id="p_28">             Accordingly, this issue is decided against the plaintiff and in
favour of the defendant company.
