      S.B. CIVIL WRIT PETITION NO.1284/2006
    Bhanwar Lal     Vs. Addl.District Judge No.1 Chittorgarh &amp; ors.

Date of Order ::           23rd April 2009.

      HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE DINESH MAHESHWARI

Mr.S.L.Jain for the petitioner

Mr.M.P.Goswami and
Mr.S.R. Paliwal for Mr.Anil Bachhawat for the respondent
No.3
                              ....

BY THE COURT:</pre>

<p id="p_1">      By    way of this writ petition, the petitioner seeks to

question the       proceedings adopted against him under the

<a href="/doc/1506082/" id="a_1">Rajasthan    Public     Premises       (Eviction   of   Unauthorised

Occupants) Act</a>, 1964 ('the Act of 1964'); and the order dated

06.02.2006 (Annex.4) as passed by the Additional District

Judge No.1, Chittorgarh in Civil Misc. Appeal No.35/2005

affirming the order dated 12.01.2004 (Annex.3) as passed by

the Estate Officer (Sub Divisional Magistrate), Chittorgarh in

Case No.1/2002 whereby the Estate Officer has accepted the

application made on behalf of the respondent Rajasthan State

Road Transport Corporation ('RSRTC')               moved under the

provisions of the Act of 1964 and has issued directions for

eviction of the petitioner from the premises in question situated

at Bus Stand, Chittorgarh with recovery of due licence fees.

</p><p id="p_2">      Put in brief, the background facts and relevant aspects

of the matter are that an agreement (Annex.1) was entered
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                 2</span>

into between the RSRTC and the petitioner on 06.03.1979

whereby the petitioner was granted licence with the right of

carrying on business in the name of ''Fruit Stall'' at the Central

Bus Stand, Chittorgarh on the licence fees of Rs.651/- per

month with the provision for its increase by 10% for each

subsequent year until expiry of the contract period that was

stated to be five years from 01.03.1979. It is not in dispute

that even after expiry of the period of the term of licence under

the said agreement, the petitioner had continued with such

stall at the said bus stand and the respondents had continued

to accept the licence fees and even the enhanced licence

fees from the petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_3">      As shall be noticed hereafter, it is sought to be

contended on behalf of the petitioner that continuation of the

agreement even after expiry of the term of licence has resulted

in creation of lease in his favour. However, coming to such

aspects later, relevant it is to notice, as made out from the

material placed on record, that the petitioner was issued an

order dated 15.06.2001 by the respondent RSRTC to the

effect that he had been granted licence for selling fruits and

fruit juices but he had been indulging in selling packed water

bottles that was required to be stopped and else, the licence

would be revoked for violation of conditions. It appears that

the petitioner filed a civil suit in the Court of Civil Judge
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                3</span>

(Jr.Division) Chittorgarh seeking declaration against the said

order dated 15.06.2001 and for perpetual injunction; and also

moved an application for temporary injunction. The application

for temporary injunction was rejected by the learned Trial

Court on 07.07.2001 and the learned Appellate Court, the

Additional District Judge No.1 Chittorgarh,      proceeded to

dismiss the appeal preferred by the petitioner on 01.10.2002

(Annex.5) but with the observations that he would not be

evicted without due process of law.
</p>
<p id="p_4">      In the meantime, the respondent RSRTC proceeded to

issue an order dated     06.12.2001 (Annex.2)     revoking the

licence of the petitioner for violation of the terms and

conditions and for not depositing the licence fees for four

months. The order dated 06.12.2001 reads as under:-

</p><p id="p_6">      The    respondent-RSRTC        through    its   Manager,

thereafter, proceeded to move the application before the

Estate Officer stating that the petitioner was unauthorisedly

carrying on the business despite revocation of his licence and

had not made payment of the due licence fees either. The

petitioner submitted a reply in the said proceedings essentially

contending that supply of water was an integral part of of his

business of selling fruit juices and if not supplying drinking

water, his business would rather come to an end; and that

selling of sealed water was not in contravention of any of the

terms of the licence. The petitioner also contended that his

tenancy had not been terminated after serving the requisite

notice under <a href="/doc/80042/" id="a_2">Section 106</a> of the Transfer of Property Act and

that he had been regularly making payment of monthly rent.

The petitioner, however, failed to lead any evidence before the

Estate Officer whereas one witness was examined on behalf

of the applicant RSRTC.
</p>
<p id="p_7">      By the impugned order dated 12.01.2004 (Annex.3), the

learned Estate Officer proceeded to consider the issues if the

petitioner had violated the terms of licence and if the

proceedings were maintainable under the Act of 1964 and,

while deciding both these issues against the petitioner,

proceeded to find that the petitioner had violated the terms of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                               5</span>

licence and hence, his licence had rightly been cancelled on

06.12.2001; and he was not entitled to retain the possession

of the premises. The learned Estate Officer issued necessary

orders for eviction of the petitioner and for recovery of due

licence fee even while granting 15 days' time to the petitioner

to vacate and to make payment.
</p>
<p id="p_8">      The appeal taken       by the petitioner    against the

aforesaid order dated 12.01.2004 has been considered and

dismissed by the learned Additional District Judge No.1,

Chittorgarh    by the impugned order dated 06.02.2006

(Annex.4). The learned Additional District Judge held that the

petitioner was a licensee in the disputed premises and the

term of licence had been extended from time to time with

enhancement of licence fees. The learned Additional District

Judge also referred to the order dated 01.10.2002 as passed

earlier in dismissal of the appeal against the order passed on

the application for temporary injunction and observed that

selling of mineral water in the disputed premises had already

been held to be of violation of licence conditions and such an

order having become final, the Estate Officer has not

committed any error in deciding the relevant questions against

the petitioner. The learned Additional District Judge held that

the petitioner being only a licensee and not a tenant, the

provisions of <a href="/doc/80042/" id="a_3">Section 106</a> of the Transfer of Property Act would
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                    6</span>

not apply; and the licence of the petitioner having been

cancelled, he was not entitled to retain the possession of the

premises.
</p>
<p id="p_9">      The petitioner filed this writ petition          on 03.03.2006

questioning the orders aforesaid; and while considering the

matter at motion-admission, this           Court took note of the

submissions on behalf of the petitioner and passed the

following order:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">             ''Although this matter was taken up for dictation of
      order today, learned counsel for the petitioner made a
      request and sought permission to make further
      submissions. Permission is granted.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">              Learned counsel, inter alia, contends that the
      respondent No.3, i.e. Rajasthan State Road Transport
      Corporation, has continued to enhance every year the
      amount charged by them, which according to the
      petitioner amounts to rent charges although referred as
      licence fees; and according to learned counsel Mr. Jain
      from this year of 2006, the same has been enhanced to
      Rs.12,000/- per month that the petitioner has paid on 25th
      January 2006 (Annex.6).          Learned counsel further
      contends that even apart from other aspects of the
      matter, in view of Section 63 of the Easement Act, the
      petitioner is entitled for reasonable time to remove his
      goods but the respondent No.3 has put lock on the
      premises in question which is causing loss to the
      petitioner even in respect of his perishable goods.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">              Having regard to the facts and circumstances of
      the case, issue notice to show cause as to why this writ
      petition be not admitted.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">                As an interim measure, it is directed that the
      respondent No.3, i.e. Rajasthan State Road Transport
      Corporation shall open out the locks if already put on the
      premises in question and permit the petitioner to remove
      his goods, if any, lying inside the premises in question
      and not to allot the stall in question to any other person
      till the next date of hearing.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">             Learned counsel shall file process fees and
      notices in two sets during the course of day.</blockquote><p id="p_10">

</p><p id="p_11">             On filing, office to check and issue the notices
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                  7</span>

      returnable on 24th March 2006. One set be given 'Dasti'
      to the learned for petitioner for service on the
      respondents by registered post acknowledgment due.''


      From the submissions as made during the course of

arguments, it appears that for one reason or another, the

requirements of the aforesaid order have not been carried out

and rather, the premises have remained locked throughout.

Be that as it may, learned counsel for the parties have been

heard on merits.
</p>
<p id="p_12">      It has strenuously been contended by the learned

counsel for the petitioner that the licence in question         was

granted for five years at the most but then, even after the

expiry of term of licence, the respondents permitted the

petitioner to continue with the stall in question and that

resulted in creation of a tenancy between the parties and

relationship of lessor and lessee came into existence.

Learned counsel submitted that the petitioner could not have

been treated as an unauthorised occupant            nor the Estate

Officer could have been approached for the purpose of his

eviction and the entire proceedings, suffering from want of

jurisdiction with the Estate Officer, deserve to be quashed.

Learned counsel further contended that the respondents have

accepted the rent from the petitioner continuously and even

accepted enhanced rent until the month of February 2006 and

with such conduct, they have clearly waived the contravention
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                  8</span>

of terms of licence, if   any.       Learned counsel yet further

contended that the agreement had been entered into by the

respondents with the partnership firm         as stated in   the

agreement (Annex.1) whereas the notice was issued to and

the proceedings for eviction         were adopted    against the

petitioner only and not against all the related persons and

hence, the proceedings deserve to be quashed on this count

alone. Learned counsel yet further contended that condition

No. 39 of the agreement distinctly provides for jurisdiction in

case of dispute   to be of the Courts at Jaipur and for this

reason also, the proceedings were not maintainable before the

Estate Officer at Chittorgarh. Learned counsel questioned the

observations as made by the Appellate Court about the effect

of the findings as recorded in the other order dealing with the

appeal arising out of the order passed on the application for

temporary injunction and submitted that such an order on the

temporary injunction application moved in the civil suit could

not have been taken decisive of the matter and rather the

same was of no bearing. Learned counsel submitted that in

sum and substance, the allegation against the petitioner had

been of selling mineral water in contravention of terms of

licence but when the licence had been for selling fruit and

fruit juices, supplying of water in any form     could not have

been treated to be an act in contravention of or in opposition
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                               9</span>

to the terms of licence.
</p>
<p id="p_13">      Per contra, the learned counsel for the respondent

contended that the petitioner had been served with repeated

notices that he had been extended licence for selling fruits

and fruits juices   but he was also selling mineral water in

sealed bottles that was not permitted under the terms of his

licence and hence, his licence had rightly been cancelled.

Learned counsel submitted that once         the licence of the

petitioner was revoked, he was rendered an unauthorised

occupant in the premises of the respondents and for having

failed to vacate, had rightly been proceeded under the Act of

1964. Learned counsel further submitted that there had not

been any relationship of lessor and lessee       between    the

parties nor the petitioner would acquire any such status merely

for having continued in possession after the expiry of term of

his licence looking to the nature of licence given. Learned

counsel further submitted that the agreement had been with

the petitioner Bhanwar Lal        or, at his choice,   with the

partnership firm but then, it was the petitioner only who had

entered into the agreement, who had been in possession of

the stall in question, and who was carrying on business

thereat. Thus, according to the learned counsel, there was no

reason for the respondents to deal with or proceed against any

other person or against the alleged partnership firm. Learned
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                10</span>

counsel further submitted that the amount was accepted by

the respondents     under the force of circumstance and under

the orders    of the Court and otherwise they had already

terminated the licence of the petitioner.     Learned counsel

pointed out that the petitioner filed the suit only before the

Court at Chittorgarh for declaration and injunction; and

ultimately the suit was dismissed on 04.09.2003 with the Civil

Court finding the petitioner violating terms of licence. Learned

counsel contended that in view of the findings as recorded by

the Civil Court, the petitioner has no case on merits.

</p><p id="p_14">       Learned counsel for the petitioner rejoined with the

submissions that per <a href="/doc/875838/" id="a_4">Section 4</a> of the Act of 1964, notice ought

to have been served on all the persons concerned and in the

present case, the same having not been served on all the

persons mentioned in the licence, the proceedings remain

invalid.   Learned counsel further submitted that selling of

mineral water cannot be treated to be of any contravention of

the terms of licence and rather such a dealing remains the

integral part of the trade of fruit juices.   Learned counsel

further submitted that the respondents have received even

10% enhanced fees and such acceptance of enhanced fees

also results in their having treated it to be a renewal of the

terms of licence.
</p>
<p id="p_15">       Having given a thoughtful consideration to the rival
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                  11</span>

submissions and having examined the material placed on

record, this Court is unable to find any reason to consider any

interference in the writ jurisdiction in this matter.

</p><p id="p_16">      The hyper-technical submissions as suggested in the

present case on behalf of the petitioner could only be rejected

particularly in view of the fact that on the substance of the

dispute, the petitioner did file the civil suit for declaration and

injunction that was ultimately dismissed by the Additional Civil

Judge (Sr.Division) No.1 Chittorgarh (C.O. No.88/2002) on

04.09.2003. The petitioner made the submissions in the said

suit that he had been granted licence for selling fruit and fruit

juices in the year 1979 and that he had been making payment

of licence fees and such licence had been renewed from time

to time and that the licence was in operation. The petitioner

stated in paragraph-2 of the plaint thus:

</p><p id="p_19">      The said suit was filed on 20.06.2001 seeking to

question the order dated 15.06.2001 whereby the petitioner

was required not to carry on the business of selling mineral
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                                12</span>

water and other material contrary to his licence and else, for

adopting of proceedings for cancellation of licence.        The

suggestions as made in this writ petition that the relationship

between the parties     took the character of a lease of the

premises in question could only be rejected in the face of

such specific averments taken by the petitioner relating to his

relationship with the respondents; and about the fact that there

had been extension of his licence from time to time. Even

otherwise, looking to the nature of agreement between the

parties whereby the petitioner was given the right of selling

certain goods to the travelling public at a 8' x 6' size stall at

Bus Stand of the respondent, there appears no reason to

consider coming into existence of any lease between the

parties.
</p>
<p id="p_20">       So far acceptance of licence fees or even enhanced

licence fees is concerned, if, for any reason, the petitioner had

continued in occupation of the premises during the pendency

of the appropriate proceedings even after passing of the order

dated 06.12.2001 whereby his licence was revoked,        neither

the respondents could be faulted in requiring the petitioner to

pay the licence fees and so also the enhanced fees as per

terms of the agreement nor by the reason of the respondents'

acceptance of such fees, any new relationship could be

treated to have come into existence.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                                 13</span><p id="p_21">

</p><p id="p_22">      The submission about the respondents having not taken

proceedings against all the related persons remains baseless

and uncertain.      The aforesaid civil suit was filed by the

petitioner alone     with the submissions       that he was the

licensee of the respondent.          It does not appear that the

petitioner ever asserted the stall in question having been dealt

with or managed by any partnership firm or by any other

person besides himself. The names of certain persons stated

in the alternative in the agreement (Annex.1) hardly make out

a case that licence was extended to any partnership firm or to

any person other than the petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_23">

</p><p id="p_24">      The submission about want of jurisdiction at Chittorgarh

is also baseless. Even when it was stated that in case of any

dispute under the terms of agreement, jurisdiction would be of

the Courts at Jaipur, such a term could not be read as that of

exclusive jurisdiction of the Courts at Jaipur so as to oust the

jurisdiction of the Courts at Chittorgarh.      In fact,   such an

objection was earlier raised by the present respondent in the

civil suit filed by the petitioner at Chittorgarh but the learned

Trial Court did not agree with such submission and decided

the   relevant     issue   against    the   defendant-respondent.

Moreover, the present one had been the proceedings under

the Act of 1964 and have rightly been dealt with by the Estate
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                                          14</span>

Officer within whose jurisdiction the premises in question are

situated.
</p>
<p id="p_25">      Even on merits, the case of the petitioner does not

inspire confidence; and licence of the petitioner cannot be said

to have been revoked on irrelevant considerations. This Court

does not find any necessity of dilating further on this aspect

fundamentally for the reason that such an aspect, that he was

entitled to sell      mineral water            as part and parcel       of the

business of selling of fruits and fruit juices,          was put to issue

by the petitioner in the civil suit filed by him; and had been

decided against him by the learned Civil Court                      with the

following finding:-

</p><p id="p_28">      The said finding having become final, so far the

petitioner is concerned, any argument thereagainst cannot be

countenanced.
</p>
<p id="p_29">      In the aforesaid view of the matter, there appears no

reason to consider any interference in the writ jurisdiction in

this matter. Merely because the Appellate Court has made

additionally a reference to the observations made in the order

passed in appeal relating to the temporary injunction

application,   the entire of the order cannot be considered

illegal or erroneous. This aspect also looses        its relevance

when it is noticed that ultimately       the findings have been

reached by the learned Civil Court against the petitioner while

dismissing     the civil suit filed by him.      Even when the

observations as made in the orders relating to temporary

injunction application might not be having directing bearing,

the findings as rendered in the civil suit cannot be ignored;

and the submissions as sought to be made in the present

petition contrary to such findings cannot be countenanced.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                                 16</span>

</p><p id="p_30">       The contentions as urged on behalf of the petitioner do

not make out a case for interference in this matter in the writ

jurisdiction.
</p>
<p id="p_31">       The writ petition fails and is, therefore, dismissed.

       The learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the

petitioner may be permitted to remove his goods and material

from the premises in question; and points out that he had

already deposited the amount payable under the agreement

in question until the month of February 2006.

</p><p id="p_32">       This writ petition was entertained on 10.03.2006 with the

order aforesaid and the matter has remained pending

thereafter. Having regard to the facts and circumstances, it is

considered appropriate and hence ordered that while opening

the locks of the premises in question, the respondents shall

notify the petitioner to remain present and if requisite licence

fee had been deposited until the month of February 2006, the

petitioner shall be permitted to remove his goods or material, if

any, against due receipt. The petitioner shall stand at notice

to appear before the respondents for carrying out the

requirement of this order on 08.05.2009 at 10:30 a.m.

        In the circumstances, the parties are left to bear their

own costs.
