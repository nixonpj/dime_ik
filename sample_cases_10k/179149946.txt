<pre id="pre_1">   THE HON'BLE SRI JUSTICE M. SATYANARAYANA MURTHY


               CRIMINAL PETITION No.4899 OF 2018
ORDER:
</pre>
<p id="p_1">         The petitioners, who are accused in Crime No.189 of 2017 of

Bhongir Town Police Station, Nalgonda District, registered for the

offence punishable under <a href="/doc/1183069/" id="a_1">Sections 386</a> and <a href="/doc/1897847/" id="a_2">120-B</a> of the Indian

Penal Code, 1860 (for short '<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_3">I.P.C</a>.'), filed this criminal petition under

<a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_4">Section 438</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (for short

'<a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_5">Cr.P.C</a>.') to issue a direction to the Station House Officer to release

them on bail in the event of their arrest in connection with the above

crime.
</p>
<p id="p_2">      The main contention of the learned counsel for the petitioners

is that though the petitioners are not arraigned as accused in the

above crime, they are called to the Police Station in connection with

the   above    crime   and   there   is   any   amount   of   reasonable

apprehension of their arrest and sought a direction to the Station

House Officer, Bhongir Town Police Station, Nalgonda District, to

release the petitioners on bail in the event of their arrest in

connection with the above crime.
</p>
<p id="p_3">      Though the petitioners' counsel contended that the petitioners

were called by the police about 4 times, there is no such allegation

in the entire petition, making an allegation during argument is not

sufficient to conclude that there is a reasonable apprehension of

their arrest in connection with the above crime.

</p><p id="p_4">      Power under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_6">Section 438</a> CrPC is purely discretionary and the

Court has to exercise its power judicially based on settled principles,

but the circumstances may vary from case to case and the law

regarding grant of bail is literally discussed by the Constitutional
                                                                   CRLP_4899_2018
                                                                          MSM, J

Bench in <a href="/doc/1308768/" id="a_7">Gurbaksh Singh Sibbia and Others v. State Of Punjab1</a>

as      the    power      of   granting   'anticipatory   bail'    is   somewhat

extraordinary in character and it is only in exceptional cases where

it appears that a person might be falsely implicated, or a frivolous

case might be launched against him, or "there are reasonable

grounds for holding that a person accused of an offence is not likely

to abscond, or otherwise misuse his liberty while on bail" that such

power is to be exercised. At paragraph 45 of the Judgment, it was

held as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">                    "We have said that there is one proposition formulated
          by the High Court with which we are inclined to agree. That
          is preposition No. (2). We agree that a 'blanket order' of
          anticipatory bail should not generally be passed. This flows
          from the very language of the section which, as discussed
          above, requires the applicant to show that he has "reason to
          believe" that he may be arrested. A belief can be said to be
          founded on reasonable grounds only if there is something
          tangible to go by on the basis of which it can be said that the
          applicant's apprehension that he may be arrested is genuine.
          That is why, normally, a direction should not issue under
          Section 438(1) to the effect that the applicant shall be
          released on bail "whenever arrested for whichever offence
          whatsoever." That is what is meant by a 'blanket order' of
          anticipatory bail, an order which serves as a blanket to cover
          or protect any and every kind of allegedly unlawful activity, in
          fact any eventuality, likely or unlikely regarding which, no
          concrete information can possibly be had. The rationale of a
          direction under Section 438(1) is the belief of the applicant
          founded on reasonable grounds that he may be arrested for a
          non-bailable offence. It is unrealistic to expect the applicant
          to draw up his application with the meticulousness of a
          pleading in a civil case and such is not requirement of the
          section. But specific events and facts must be disclosed by
          the applicant in order to enable the court to judge of the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">1</span>
    1980 AIR 1632
                                                               CRLP_4899_2018
                                                                      MSM, J

         reasonableness of his belief, the existence of which is the sine
         qua non of the exercise of power conferred by the section."
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_2">         Therefore, while dealing with the application for grant of pre-
</blockquote>
<p id="p_5">arrest     bail   or   anticipatory   bail,   the   Court   must    take    into

consideration the guidelines issued in Gurbaksh Singh Sibbia case.

</p><p id="p_6">         If the principle laid down is applied to the facts of the present

case, petitioners are not entitled to claim pre-arrest bail for the

reason that there is no tangible material in support of reasonable

apprehension of their arrest in connection with non-bailable offence,

that too the petitioners are the members of gang of notorious

gangster Nayeem, having of lot of criminal record.

</p><p id="p_7">         The public prosecutor (TS) contended that the petitioners are

arraigned as A.2 and A.4 based on the confession of A.3 in the above

crime and that A.2 involved in two other cases of Nayeem, who is a

notorious gangster. The petitioners are the relatives of the said

Nayeem.
</p>
<p id="p_8">         The petitioners did not disclose these details and made a bald

allegation that they were arraigned as accused and made an attempt

to obtain pre-arrest bail by playing fraud suppressing the criminal

background on the court. Hence, the petitioners are not entitled to

claim pre-arrest bail.
</p>
<p id="p_9">         In the result, the criminal petition is dismissed.

</p><p id="p_10">                                       ___________________________________
