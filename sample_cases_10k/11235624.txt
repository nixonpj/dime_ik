                                    Order

16/01/2019

</pre><p id="p_11">     An application has been filed by the respondents pointing out

that during pendency of the writ petition, petitioners No.2 &amp; 3
                                                                           (2 of 2)             [CW-3373/2015]



                                   have been granted promotion, whereas the petitioners No.1 &amp; 4

                                   have not been found eligible for grant of promotion as Teacher

                                   Gr.II by the DPC.
</p>
<p id="p_12">                                        It is, inter-alia, further indicated that the challenge laid in the

                                   writ petition pertains to the fact that the DPC for promotional post

                                   was not convened from the last three years and the petitioners,

                                   who were working on the post of Teacher Gr.II, were sought to be

                                   given posting on their substantive posts i.e. Teacher Gr.III.

                                   Therefore, in view of the fact that during pendency of the writ

                                   petition, the DPC has been held and out of four petitioners, two

                                   are eligible for promotion to the post of Teacher Gr.II and two

                                   petitioners have failed in that regard, the petition has been

                                   rendered infructuous.
</p>
<p id="p_13">                                        Despite service of the application neither any response has

                                   been filed nor anyone is present for the petitioners.

</p><p id="p_14">                                        The writ petition filed by the petitioners, with the holding of

                                   DPC for the post of Teacher Gr.II has been rendered infructuous.
