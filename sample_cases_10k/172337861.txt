</pre>
<p id="p_1">RAJESH BINDAL, J

</p><p id="p_2">1.           The present writ petition has been filed impugning the order dated

28.03.2018 passed by the Jammu and Kashmir State Consumer Disputes

Redressal Commission, Jammu (for short 'the Commission'), whereby appeal

filed against the order passed by the District Consumer Disputes Redressal

Forum, Jammu (for short 'the District Forum') dated 13.02.2016, was

dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_3">2.           Learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that one Maruti 800

car, bearing registration No. JK02X-4578 owned by the respondent No.1 met
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                          2                    OWP No.1760/2018</span>

with an accident on 07.02.2012. The vehicle was brought to the workshop of

the petitioners on 10.02.2012. Estimate for repairs was prepared by the

petitioners on 25.02.2012. It was the calculation to make the vehicle road

worthy. The amount estimated was ₹ 1,20,580/-. The estimate did not have any

relation with the amount which may be reimbursed by the insurance company

on account of various conditions in the policy. The insurance company was

informed. Surveyor was appointed on 06.03.2012. He inspected the vehicle on

08.03.2012 and submitted his report on 18.06.2012. The vehicle had been

insured for a sum of ₹ 97,380/- and the condition in the policy provided that in

case the cost of repair is more than 75% of the insured value, the vehicle shall

be treated as total loss. The surveyor had estimated the claim of ₹ 60,674/- as

the same did not exceed 75% of the insured value, the insurance company did

not declare the vehicle as total loss.
</p>
<p id="p_4">3.           It was further submitted that the petitioners sent a communication

to the respondent No.1/the owner of the vehicle and asked him to deposit

₹ 25,000/- as advance so as to enable the petitioners to start repairs of the

vehicle, as insurance company had assessed the claim only to the tune of

₹ 60,674/-. The delay was for the reason that the respondent No.1 was

persuading the insurance company to declare the vehicle as total loss. The

aforesaid letter of the petitioners was replied to by the respondent No.1/owner

on 15.03.2013 consenting to the repairs. It was followed by another letter dated

02.04.2013. Thereafter, on 28.05.2013, the respondent No.1/owner deposited a

sum of ₹ 2,500/- towards repairs of the vehicle. After complete repairs, final

bill to the tune of ₹ 1,23,111/- was prepared. In fact the vehicle had been

repaired in the year 2013 only. However, the billing and other formalities were

kept pending on the request of the petitioners as he was persuading the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                       3                        OWP No.1760/2018</span>

insurance company to declare the vehicle as total loss. This is even evident

from the fact that the respondent No.1 filed a complaint before the District

Forum with a prayer for reimbursement of loss and payment of compensation.

</p><p id="p_5">4.           The argument is that the District Forum committed an error in

allowing the complaint filed by the respondent No.1. It declared the vehicle as

total loss while calculating the estimate prepared by the surveyor appointed by

the insurance company and the amount of advance demanded by the petitioners

for carrying out the repairs. Taking the total amount as more than 75%, the

vehicle was declared as total loss. In appeal filed by the petitioners before the

State Commission, it was wrongly recorded that the insurance company had

agreed to pay ₹ 25,000/-. Some error was committed. The insurance company

was not aggrieved against the orders passed by the authorities below. While

deciding the appeal the State Commission had granted liberty to the petitioners

to seek relief from the insurance company. The petitioners have been left in

dilemma. The owner of the vehicle got the claim of total loss of vehicle from

the insurance company. He is happy. The petitioners carried out the repairs of

the vehicle and bill for the same was raised to the tune of ₹ 1,23,111/- but the

same is not being paid to the petitioners and no one has come forward to take

delivery of the vehicle. Once the vehicle has been repaired with the consent of

the owner, he is bound to pay repair charges and take delivery of the vehicle. It

is further submitted that the repaired car which is standing in the workshop of

the petitioners has practically becomes a salvage as the same is not in use for

more than six years.
</p>
<p id="p_6">5.           On the other hand, Mr. Sunil Sethi, learned senior counsel for the

respondent No.1 submitted that it is a strange case where the insured value of

the vehicle was merely ₹ 97,380/- and on account of accident, the estimate
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                        4                       OWP No.1760/2018</span>

given for carrying out repairs by the petitioners was ₹ 1,20,580/-. The

respondent No.1 never consented to the repair of the vehicle as there was

dispute pending before the District Forum. In fact, the vehicle was never

repaired. False bill was raised more than two years thereafter on 14.10.2015.

After the award of the District Forum, the respondent No.1 has already been

paid ₹ 97,380/- by the insurance company as the vehicle has been declared as

total loss and the ownership thereof has been transferred in the name of the

insurance company. There was no communication from the side of petitioners

either to the respondent No.1 or to the insurance company that the vehicle in

question has been repaired and the delivery thereof be taken. It is strange to

note that argument has been raised by the petitioners that the vehicle, for which

amount claimed for repairs by the petitioners is more than the insured value,

has become salvage in last six years while the same is parked with the

petitioners.    He further submitted that so called estimate of repairs of

₹ 1,20,580/- was never intimated to the respondent No.1. It is not even pleaded

by the petitioners that the same was given to the insurance company. Deposit

of ₹ 2,500/- by the respondent No.1 was not consent for carrying out the

repairs.
</p>
<p id="p_7">6.             Mr. Suneel Malhotra, learned counsel appearing for the insurance

company submitted that the surveyor appointed by the company had assessed

the loss at ₹ 60,674/-, which the insurance company agreed to pay to the

insured. There is no agreement by the insurance company with the petitioners.

In fact, the vehicle was not a total loss. However, still as directed by the

District Forum and to avoid any future dispute, insurance company accepted

the award and paid the amount to the insured. Thereafter the company is

entitled to the salvage which the owner as well as the petitioners had not
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                         5                        OWP No.1760/2018</span>

delivered to the insurance company. As regards payment of amount for repairs

is concerned, it is a dispute between the petitioners and the respondent No.1.

The insurance company has nothing to do.
</p>
<p id="p_8">7.          Heard learned counsels for the parties and perused the paper book.

</p><p id="p_9">8.          It is a case in which apparently all the parties are at fault. The

facts of the case speak volumes about the same. Maruti 800 Car bearing

Registration No. JK02X-4578 was owned by the respondent No.1. The vehicle

was insured with the respondent-company for a sum of ₹ 97,380/-. For quick

look relevant facts have been jotted down in the table below:

</p><pre id="pre_2">               Events                                            Dates
               Date of accident.                                 07.02.2012
               Date on which the vehicle was brought to          10.02.2012
               the workshop.

               Preparation of estimate of repairs by the         25.02.2012
               workshop.
               The amount calculated was ₹ 1,20,580/-.

               There is nothing on record to suggest as to
               whether the owner of the vehicle informed
               the insurance company about the accident.

               Date of appointment of surveyor.                  06.03.2012

               surveyor.

               The amount of claim assessed by the
               surveyor was ₹ 60,674/-.

               Filing of complaint by the owner of the        19.12.2013

               vehicle before the District Forum.

</pre><p id="p_10">               Generation of bill for repair of the vehicle   14.10.2015
               by the petitioners workshop.
</p>
<p id="p_11">               The District Forum accepted the complaint      13.02.2016
               and directed that the vehicle to be treated
               as total loss and consequent payment of
               amount to the owner of the vehicle.
</p>
<p id="p_12">               The insurance Company accepted the order
               passed by the District Forum and complied
               with the same.
</p>
<p id="p_13">
</p><p id="p_14">9.           From the facts, which have been mentioned in chronological order

date wise in the aforesaid table clearly establish that each one of the three

parties, namely owner of the vehicle, the workshop and the Insurance

Company were at default in not taking up the matter seriously. There was

inordinate delay on the part of all of them.
</p>
<p id="p_15">10.          The State Commission rejected the appeal filed by the petitioners,

while upholding the order passed by the District Forum opining that the

estimate prepared by the surveyor appointed by the Insurance Company was

₹ 60,674/- and the Insurance Company having consented to pay another

₹ 25,000/-, the amount would come out to ₹ 85,674/-, which was more than

75% of the insured value, hence, the vehicle was to be declared total loss. The

findings are erroneous as there is not consent as such by the Insurance

Company to pay ₹ 25,000/- over and above the estimate prepared by the

surveyor.
</p>
<p id="p_16">11.          There is huge delay even on the part of the petitioners to prepare

the estimates to repair the vehicle or to correspond with the owner of the

vehicle or the Insurance Company. Though it was sought to be claimed that

the vehicle was repaired in the year 2013 only, the bill thereof was raised only

on 14.10.2015, that too when the matter was pending before the District

Forum. It was nearly two years after the filing of the compliant. None of the

parties apparently took effective steps to make efforts to sort out the issue.

There is nothing referred to from the record as to whether after the vehicle was

repaired, as is claimed by the petitioners, any intimation thereof was sent to the

owner of the vehicle.
</p>
<p id="p_17">12.          The Insurance Company accepted the order passed by the District

Forum and did not challenge it any further. It was challenged only by the

workshop. While dismissing the first appeal, however, the State Commission

had observed that dismissal of the appeal will not preclude the petitioners to

seek appropriate relief from the Insurance Company.
</p>
<p id="p_18">13.          There is nothing pointed out from the record as to whether any

other proceedings were initiated by the petitioners against the respondents or

the respondents against the petitioners with reference to the dispute in

question.
</p>
<p id="p_19">14.          Learned counsel for the owner of the vehicle had submitted that

Insurance Company having paid the amount to him as per the directions of the

District Forum, he had transferred the ownership thereof in the name of the

Insurance Company. The Insurance Company had claimed that on payment of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                                         8                            OWP No.1760/2018</span>

           claim by declaring the vehicle as total loss the Company is entitled to the

           salvage. The vehicle has been retained by the workshop after the repairs, as the

           owner of the vehicle had failed to pay the amount of repairs. Important aspect

           is that the insured value of vehicle was ₹ 97,380/- and after the accident when

           the estimate was prepared by the petitioners, the cost of repairs was assessed at

           ₹ 1,20,580/- and the final bill raised for repairs was ₹ 1,23,111/-.

</p><p id="p_20">           15.                 Keeping in view the facts and circumstances of the case, as has

           been discussed above, in our opinion, all the three parties being at default, the

           issue can be resolved by directing the Insurance Company to transfer the

           ownership of the vehicle in the name of the petitioners instead of it claiming

           the salvage after payment of the claim by declaring the vehicle as total loss in

           terms of the order passed by the District Forum. On transfer of the ownership

           of the vehicle, in whatever conditions the same is, the petitioners shall be at

           liberty to make use of that or dispose of the same. Beyond that they cannot be

           held entitled any other amount. Relief was required to be moulded keeping in

           view the facts and circumstances of the case.
</p>
<p id="p_21">           16.                 With the aforesaid modification in the order passed by the State

           Commission, the present petition is disposed of.
