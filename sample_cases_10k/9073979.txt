Present:    Mr. Deepak Sibal, Senior Advocate with

</p><p id="p_2">1.          The relief claimed in the present writ petition is for issuance of a

direction to consider the candidates from reserved category to general category

candidates on the strength of their merit.
</p>
<p id="p_3">2.          The petitioner's case is that she belongs to a Schedule Caste(SC)

category and appeared in All India Pre-Medical Test conducted by the Central

Board of Secondary Education on 4.5.2014. She applied for admission with

respondent no.2-institute which has 77 UT Chandigarh pool seats. Out of these

12 seats belong to SC category (15%) and 2 belong to category of physically

disabled candidates (3%) whereas general seats are 63. It is the case of the

petitioner that she is at merit No.14 of the list of SC candidates and one

physically disabled seat had been converted into a general seat raising

availability of general seats to 64. It is further case of the petitioner that 2 SC

candidates namely Himanshi and Preet who have secured 68.88% and 63.4%

marks in the entrance test and are at merit No.35 and 63 and are being adjusted

against the SC category seats instead of being adjusted on the strength of their

merit in the general category. It is accordingly submitted that in case they are

adjusted against general category seats, then the petitioner who is at no.14

would come at Sr. No.12 and would be entitled for admission as SC candidate.

                                                                  Chandigarh

Reference has also been made to the legal notice served on July 17, 2014

(Annexure P/2).      It is   submitted that counselling is stated to be fixed for

tomorrow and in spite of legal notice sent, no action has been taken.

</p><p id="p_5">3.             In such circumstances, this Court is of the opinion that respondents

need not be called upon as admittedly as per the terms of prospectus itself

admission is to be made as pleaded by the petitioner. Reference can be safely

made to Clause 2 of the Central Admission Brochure (Annexure P/1) circulated

by respondent no.2. The said Clause reads as under:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">               "2.   All eligible candidates, except in the NRI category, will be

               considered for admission against General category seats according

               to their rank/merit in the combined list, in addition to the

               category/categories they have applied for.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">               Important Note:- Candidate(s)    belonging to a reserved category

               who obtains admission on the basis of his/her rank/merit in the

               General category shall not be counted towards the seats for the

               reserved category concerned."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_6">4.             By calling upon the respondents only the admissions would be

delayed as unnecessarily a seat would have to be reserved.                          In such

circumstances, respondent no.2 is directed to decide the representation of the

petitioner by passing a speaking order before the counselling process is finalised

tomorrow and if the relief claimed is found genuine, the petitioner would be

accordingly adjusted as prayed for and in case the relief is not to be granted, a

speaking order be passed and conveyed to the petitioner.

</p><p id="p_7">5.             With the aforesaid observations, the present writ petition stands

disposed of.
</p>
<p id="p_8">6.             A copy of this order be supplied to the counsel for the petitioner

under the signature of the Special Secretary of this Court.
