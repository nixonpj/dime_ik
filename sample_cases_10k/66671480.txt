      a brief statement of the reasons for the decision:-

01.         A police report was put up against the accused by the

State through Station House Officer of PS Farsh Bazar on 26.02.01

alleging that on 10.10.00 at about 1:30 pm at 18 quarters, Vishwas

Nagar, Delhi accused was found with 40 pouches of illicit liquor
                                   2

without any licence or permit and thereby committed an offence

punishable u/s 61 <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_4">Excise Act</a>, hence he should be punished as per

law.

02.         After filing of the police report, cognizance of offence

under <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_5">section 61</a> Excise Act was taken by my learned predecessor

court and the accused was called upon to face trial after complying

with the requirement of <a href="/doc/1613898/" id="a_6">section 207</a> of CrPC.

03.         On 23.07.03 having heard the APP for the State and the

accused a formal charge was framed against the accused for his

having committed an offence punishable under <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_7">section 61</a> Excise Act

to which the accused pleaded not guilty and subsequently he was put

on trial.

04.         In support of its case the prosecution examined as many

as four witnesses. PW 1 is constable Premveer, PW 2 is constable

Praveen Kumar, PW 3 is constable SI Dharampal, PW 4 is ASI Shri

Ram.

05.         During the prosecution evidence documents Ex. PW 1/A,

Ex. PW 1/B, Ex. PW 1/C, Ex. PW 2/A, Ex. PW 4/A, Ex. PW 4/B, Ex.

PW 4/C, Ex. PW 4/D were examined and the case property Ex. P1 to

Ex. P 2 were also tendered and subsequently PE was directed to be
                                   3

closed.

06.       The accused was examined under <a href="/doc/224316/" id="a_8">section 281</a> CrPC and

all the incriminating evidence were brought to his notice. Accused

expressed his innocence during his examination and further

submitted that he is innocent and he has been falsely implicated in

the present case. Accused did not lead his defence evidence.

07.       I have also given my thoughtful consideration on the

prosecution evidence which are as under:

          PW 1 is      constable Premveer who deposed that on

10.10.00</pre><p id="p_1"> he was posted at police station Farsh Bazar and on that

day he was on reserve duty and after receiving DD No 18 A he

along with HC Sri Ram reached at the spot at 18 quarters, Vishwas

Nagar near dharam kanta where constable Praveen and constable

Dharam met them and produced the accused with one parrot green

colour bag, IO checked the said bag and found 40 pouches of country

made liquor on which dildar masaleydar desi sharab was written. PW

1 further deposed that IO poured contents of every pouch in the

plastic cane, took our one quarter bottle as sample, prepared pulanda

and kept empty pouches in same bag. Bag, sample and plastic cane

were sealed with the seal of SR and seal after use was handed over
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                  4</span>

to constable Dharampal, IO filled up    excise form and prepared

seizure   memo Ex. PW 1/A, IO recorded statement of constable

Praveen, prepared rukka and handed over the same to him for

registration of the FIR. PW 1 further deposed that after getting FIR

registered he returned back at the spot and handed over copy of FIR

and rukka to the IO who arrested the accused and conducted his

personal search vide memo Ex. PW 1/B and Ex. PW 1/C.

</p><p id="p_2">          PW 2 is constable Praveen Kumar, PW 3 is constable

Dharampal and PW 4 is ASI Shri Ram who deposed on the same

line of facts as deposed by PW 1 hence same are not reproduced

here. In addition of that PW 2 also deposed that IO recorded his

statement Ex. PW 2/A and PW 4 deposed that he prepared rukka Ex.

PW 4/A, prepared site plan Ex. PW 4/B, information of arrest of

accused was given to the wife of accused which is Ex. PW 4/C, form

M 29 is Ex. PW 4/D and accused was released on            bail bond

executed by Rajkumari which is Ex. PW 4/E.
</p>
<p id="p_3">08.       I have heard Ld. APP for the State and counsel for the

accused and perused the record carefully. During the course of the

final arguments counsel for the accused submits that prosecution

has failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt hence accused
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                     5</span>

be acquitted for charged offence.
</p>
<p id="p_4">09.         In support of the arguments of the acquittal of the

accused, counsel for the accused submits that prosecution examined

four witnesses   who are all police witnesses but they have not

supported the case of the prosecution and they have material

contradictions in their testimonies. Counsel for the accused submits

that PW 2 and PW 3 are the recovery witness but they have no

consistency in their deposition as PW 2 constable Praveen Kumar

deposed that accused was coming from shamshan ghat and he was

having    a bag whereas PW 3        constable Dharampal stated that

accused    was coming from Vishwas Nagar along with one plastic

katta, which is very contradictory. Counsel for the accused further

submits that PW 2 constable Anil deposed that constable Dharampal

gave information in the police station whereas PW 3       constable

Dharampal stated that constable Praveen made a telephone call to

the police station which is also very contradictory. Counsel for the

accused further submits that PW 4 IO stated in examination in chief

that accused was found along with one plastic bag at the spot when

he reached at the spot whereas in the cross examination he stated

that cloth bag was found in possession of the accused and further
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                     6</span>

submits that PW 1 stated that IO informed to the relatives of the

accused whereas PW 4 stated that information of arrest of accused

was given to the wife of the accused which is very contradictory.

Counsel for the accused further submits that IO has also not made

any public witnesses of the recovery of the alleged illicit liquor despite

the fact that alleged spot was a residential. Counsel for the accused

further submits that the aforesaid facts clearly suggest that accused

was falsely implicated in the present case and prosecution has failed

to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt hence accused be

acquitted.
</p>
<p id="p_5">10.          On the other hand Ld. APP for the State submits that

prosecution has proved its case beyond reasonable doubt however

there are some technical aspects as pointed out by the counsel for

the accused but same does not weak the case of the prosecution.

</p><p id="p_6">11.          After having gone through the submissions of the counsel

of the accused and submissions of the Ld. APP for the State as well

as perusal of the record I find that prosecution has failed to prove its

case beyond reasonable doubt on following grounds:

</p><p id="p_7">             Firstly, I find that there are several contradictions in the

evidence of prosecution. I find that as per the prosecution version
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                     7</span>

there are two recovery witnesses namely constable Praveen Kumar

and constable Dharampal who stated that they were on patrolling

duty but abovesaid witnesses have not shown any document / DD

entry by which it can be shown that they were on patrolling duty in

the concerned area.
</p>
<p id="p_8">           For knowing the importance of the DD entry of arrival and

departure of the police officials from the police station, I have perused

Chapter 22 Rule 49 of Punjab Police Rules, 1934 which reads as

under:
</p>
<p id="p_9">           "22.49 Matters to be entered in Register No. II. The

following matters shall, amongst others, be entered:

</p><p id="p_10">           (c)        The hour of arrival and departure on duty at or

from a police station of all enrolled police officers of whatever rank,

whether posted at all police station or elsewhere, with a statement of

the nature of their duty. This entry shall be made immediately on

arrival or prior to the departure of the officer concerned and shall be

attested by the latter personally by signature or seal.

Note:      The term Police Station will include all places such as

Police Lines and Police Posts where Register No. II is maintained.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                    8</span>

</p><p id="p_11">           In the present case, the above said provision appears to

have not been complied with by prosecution. As per the prosecution

version at the time of the apprehension of the accused with illicit

liquor in his possession, constable Praveen Kumar and constable

Dharampal were on the area patrolling duty but the DD entry vide

which they had left the PS for patrolling has not been brought on

record. Even the number of the said DD entry made in Register No. II

has not been brought on judicial record. In my opinion prosecution

was under an obligation to prove on record, the above said DD entry

vide which above said police officials had left the PS for patrolling

duty so as to prove the possibility of availability of constable Praveen

Kumar and constable Dharampal at the place of apprehension of

the accused. In the facts and circumstances of the case, the

prosecution ought to have proved the DD entry by which the above

said police officials had left the PS so as to inspire the confidence

regarding their availability / presence at the place of apprehension of

the accused. At this juncture, it would be relevant to refer to a case

law reported as Rattan Lal versus State 1987 (2) Crimes 29 the

Hon'ble Delhi High Court wherein it has been observed that if the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                     9</span>

investigating agency deliberately ignores to comply with the

provisions of the Act the courts will have to approach their action with

reservation. The    matter has to be viewed with suspicion if the

provisions of law are not strictly complied with and the least that can

be said is that it is so done with an oblique motive. This failure to

bring on record, the DD entry creates a reasonable doubt in the

prosecution version and attributes oblique motive on the part of the

prosecution.
</p>
<p id="p_12">           Secondly, I find that PW 2 constable Praveen Kumar

deposed that accused was coming from shamshan ghat and he was

having    a bag whereas PW 3 constable Dharampal stated that

accused    was coming from Vishwas Nagar along with one plastic

katta, which creates doubt over the prosecution case. Further, I

find that PW 2 constable Anil deposed that constable Dharampal

gave information in the police station whereas PW 3           constable

Dharampal stated that constable Praveen made a telephone call to

the police station which is also very contradictory. Further, I find that

PW 4 IO stated in examination in chief that accused was found along

with one plastic bag at the spot when he reached            at the spot
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                    10</span>

whereas in the cross examination he stated that cloth bag was found

in possession of the accused and further submits that PW 1 stated

that IO informed to the relatives of the accused whereas PW 4

stated that information of arrest of accused was given to the wife of

the accused. The aforesaid contradictions in the deposition of the

PW creates doubt over the prosecution case.
</p>
<p id="p_13">           Thirdly, I also find that IO has also not made any public

witnesses of the recovery of the alleged illicit liquor despite the fact

that alleged spot was a residential. In this regard, the explanation of

the prosecution witnesses has been that none of the public persons

agreed to join the investigation. The explanation given by the

prosecution witness does not seem plausible because in the police

report as well as the testimony of the prosecution witnesses, the

names of the public persons, who were requested to join the

investigations have not been mentioned. IO has also not taken any

action against such public persons who did not tender help to the

public servant despite they were being under an obligation to render

help on the legitimate request of the public servant.

</p><p id="p_14">            I have also relied upon citation Sadhu Singh versus

State of Punjab, (1997) 3 Crimes 55 (PH) wherein it is held that
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                    11</span>

there can be cases when public witnesses are reluctant to join or are

not available. All the same, the prosecution must show a genius

attempt having been made to join public witnesses. It is further held

that a stereo type statement of non availability of any public witness

will not be sufficient particularly when at the relevant time, it was not

difficult to procure the services of public witness. Keeping in view of

the citation, I am of the considered view that prosecution has failed to

show a genuine effort to make a public witness in regard of alleged

recovery of case property from the possession of the accused.

</p><p id="p_15">12.       In view of the above discussion I hold that the accused is

not found guilty of the charge framed against him and he is acquitted

of the charge under <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_9">section 61</a> Excise Act framed against him.

Accused be set at his liberty if he is not required in any other case.

After compliance file be sent to record room.
