                Mr.K.Balasubramanian for R5

:O R D E R
</pre><p id="p_1">        The  above  Writ  Petition has been filed by the petitioner praying to
issue a Writ of Quo-warranto to call  for  the  records  of  R.3/The  District
Collector,  Tirunelveli  dated  7.5.1997  and G.O.Ms.No.206 Social Welfare and
Nutritious Meal Programme (NMP) dt.  13.9.1996 and to set aside the  order  of
appointment  dt.7.5.1997 insofar as it relates to 6 th respondent/Tmt.K.Santhi
as it contravenes the provisions of the said G.O.Ms.No.206, dt.13.9.1996.
</p>
<p id="p_2">        2.  The case of the petitioner is that it is  a  Minority  institution
and  they  are  running the school from the year 1920 and it was recognised by
the Government of Tamil Nadu  in  the  year  1978  and  is  also  running  the
Nutritious  Meal  Programme  and  they are eligible to appoint Nutritious Meal
Organisers as per  G.O.Ms.No.918  Backward  Classes  Welfare  Department,  dt.
3.11.1989  and  G.O.Ms.No.147 Social Welfare and Nutritious Project Scheme dt.
18.6.1993 etc.  along with the approval of the  District  Collector;  that  as
such  for  appointment  of a Nutritious Meal Organiser, proposals were sent by
the petitioner  to  the  third  respondent;  that  instead  of  selecting  the
Nutritious  Meal  Organiser from the proposed candidates, the sixth respondent
was appointed by the third respondent, the District Collector.  Aggrieved, the
petitioner School has come forward to file the above Writ Petition.
</p><p id="p_3">        3.  In the counter affidavit filed by the respondents 1 to  4  besides
generally  denying  the  allegations  in the affidavit filed in support of the
above  writ  petition,  they  would  further  submit  that  according  to  the
instructions  contained  in  G.O.Ms.No.294, Social Welfare and Nutritious Meal
Programme (NMP I) Department, dated 27.10.1993, for each minority/non-minority
school, the Manager or the Correspondent will send a panel of 5 names  to  the
Collector for appointment as Nutritious Meal Organisers following the existing
conditions  of  appointment;  that the Collector shall give approval to any of
the names recommended by the Management of the  Schools  and  Communicate  his
approval  to  the  Management  of  the  concerned  school  and  thereafter the
management will issue appointment orders.
</p>
<p id="p_4">        4.  The respondents 1 to 4 would further submit that subsequently, the
Selection Committee constituted as per G.O.Ms.SNo.294, Social Welfare and Noon
Meals Programme, dated 21.10.1993 was modified as per G.  O.Ms.No.206,  Social
Welfare  and Noon Meal Programme Department, dated 13.9.1996; that accordingly
</p><p id="p_5">(i) the  Personal  Assistant(NMP)  to  Collector  is  the  Chairman  (ii)  the
Commissioner   of  the  concerned  Panchayat  Union  is  a  Member  (iii)  the
Correspondent/Headmaster of the concerned school is another member;  that  the
appointment  of  Nutritious  Meals Organisers are to be made only by the above
Committee as ordered by the Government and the appointment of the  Noon  Meals
Organiser  under  reference  was  made  only  by  the above Committee strictly
observing the Government instruction.
</p>
<p id="p_6">        5.  The respondents 1 to 4 would further submit that the Management of
minority schools are not vested with the administrative powers  of  Nutritious
Meal Programme like appointment of teacher for minority schools since the said
scheme  was  entirely  run  by  the Government and the entire expenses for the
scheme are borne by the Government; that as  the  Correspondent/Headmaster  is
one  of  the  members  in  the Selection Committee, he was asked to attend the
Selection Committee Meeting to be held on 17.4.1997; that though the  fact  of
meeting  intimation  was  acknowledged  by him, he did not attend the meeting;
that no violation of Government instructions have been made as alleged by  the
petitioner  as  the  fact of the reconstitution of the selection committee was
informed to him well in advance, further asking him to  attend  the  selection
committee meeting.
</p>
<p id="p_7">        6.   The respondents 1 to 4 would further submit that as per orders of
Government in force at that time  candidates  for  appointment  of  Noon  Meal
Organisers  shall  be  selected  only from the list received from the District
Employment Office and there is no need to consider  the  panel  of  candidates
sent  by him; that the selection of candidates made for the post of Nutritious
Meal was approved by the Collector and the appointment order was  also  issued
in the name of the Collector.
</p>
<p id="p_8">        7.   In  the  counter  affidavit  filed by the 5th respondent, besides
denying the general allegations of the affidavit filed in support of the above
writ petition, she would further submit that the appointment of the Noon Meals
Organiser  was  made  only  by  the  Selection  Committee  strictly  observing
instructions  of  the  Government; that further the Management of the minority
schools are not vested with  the  administrative  powers  of  Nutritious  Meal
Programme like  appointment  of teacher for minority schools.  Further sailing
with certain averments made by the respondents 1  to  4  she  would  pray  for
dismissal of the above writ petition.
</p>
<p id="p_9">        8.   During  arguments, the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the
petitioner and the respondents as well would reiterate only the  pleadings  of
the petition and the counter affidavits filed with no new fact or circumstance
or  law  being brought forth and therefore, tracing the same would only result
in repetition of the pleadings and hence this Court is of the view to consider
the  facts  and  circumstances  of  the  case  as  pleaded  and   in   further
consideration  of  the  materials  made  available on records, it is made very
clear on the part of  the  respondents  1  to  4  a  selection  committee  was
constituted  as  per  G.O.Ms.No.294  Social  Welfare and Noon Meals Programme,
dated 21.10.1993 and the  same  was  modified  as  per  G.O.Ms.No.206,  Social
welfare  and  Noon  Meal  Programme  Department, dated 13.9.1996, according to
which a committee has to be constituted consisting of the  Personal  Assistant
(NMP)  to  the Collector as the Chairman and the Commissioner of the concerned
Panchayat Union as a member and the Correspondent/Headmaster of the  concerned
school  as  yet  another  member  in  order  to  appoint  the Nutritious Meals
Organisers and the Noon Meals Organiser under reference has to be made only by
the said committee strictly observing the Government instructions in which the
Correspondent/Headmaster has a vital role to play and since  the  said  scheme
was  entirely  run  by  the  Government  borne  by  the  entire  expenses, the
petitioner should have cooperated with the administration in  the  process  of
the appointment of the Noon Meals Organisers.  But on the contrary in spite of
the  petitioner  being invited to attend to the meeting held on 17.4.1997 they
did not attend to the meeting and therefore, not for any violation of the rule
or the procedures established by law the respondents 1 to 5 could be blamed.
</p>
<p id="p_10">        9.  Moreover, the constitution of the committee  is  made  with  equal
representation of the Revenue Administration, Local body and the Correspondent
or  Headmaster  of  the  concerned  school  for which the appointment is to be
effected, it is an healthy trend and since the same is made  falling  in  line
and in tune with the expected norms of law it would only fall under reasonable
classification  arrived  at  on  the part of the Government in formulating the
G.O.  in which it has only done  a  yeoman  service  to  the  Nutritious  Meal
Programme  particularly  in  the  appointment  of  Noon  Meal  Organisers  and
therefore, there is absolutely no necessity on  the  part  of  this  Court  to
either do  away  from the G.O.  or to question the validity of the appointment
of the 6th respondent for the post of Noon Meal Organiser to the  petitioner's
school and hence the following order:
</p>
<p id="p_11">        In result,
</p><p id="p_12">        (i)  the above writ petition does not merit acceptance and the same is
dismissed as such;
</p><p id="p_13">        (ii) however, in the circumstances of the  case,  there  shall  be  no
order as to costs.
