                          JUDGMENT
</pre>

<p id="p_1">     Plaintiff has filed suit for declaring the name of plaintiff's

father   as   SURYANARAYANA               BHATTA.H     instead    of

SUBRAMANYA BHAT.H and also name of the plaintiff as

SANDEEP BHATTA.H.S instead of SANDEEP BHAT.H.S.




</p><p id="p_2">     2. Brief facts of the plaint are as under:


     The plaintiff's father name is Suryanarayana Bhatta H by

oversight in school records of plaintiff; it is wrongly entered as

Subramanya Bhat.H.       Likewise, the name of plaintiff also

wrongly shown as Sandeep Bhat H.S instead of Sandeep

Bhatta H S.     He came to know the said mistake recently.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                  4</span>




Immediately he approached the defendants to change the

correct name, they instructed to obtain decree. Later he got

issued notice U/Sec.80 of CPC to defendants to rectify the

name; they did not heed the request of the plaintiff. Hence,

filed this suit.
</p>
<p id="p_3">


</p><p id="p_4">      3. In pursuance to the service of summons, defendants

are remained absent and placed exparte.




</p><p id="p_5">      4. To prove the case plaintiff got examined as PW-1 and

got the documents marked at Ex.P-1 to 15.




</p><p id="p_6">      5. Heard the counsel for plaintiff.




</p><p id="p_7">      6. The following points arise for my consideration are :-


</p><p id="p_8">        1. Whether the plaintiff proves that name of his
           father and his name are wrongly entered in his
           school records?
</p>
<p id="p_9">        2. Whether the plaintiff is entitled for the relief as
           sought for?
</p><p id="p_10">                                                              CCH-33
                                                        O.S.3561/17
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                5</span>


</p><p id="p_11">       3. What Order or decree?
</p>
<p id="p_12">


</p><p id="p_13">     7. My findings on the above issues are as under:


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">           Point No.1: In the affirmative

           Point No.2: In the affirmative

           Point No.3: See the final order, for the following:

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">                              REASONS


</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">     8. Point Nos.1 and 2: Learned counsel for the plaintiff

argued that as per the evidence of P.W.1 and documents Ex.P1

to P15, plaintiff has proved his case.




</blockquote><p id="p_14">     9. On careful perusal of the material placed before the

Court, P.W.1 has filed affidavit in lieu of his chief examination

and reiterated the contents of the plaint averments. P.W.1 has

stated that the plaintiff's father name is Suryanarayana

Bhatta.H. By oversight in school records of plaintiff, name of

father of the plaintiff is wrongly entered as Subramanya

Bhat.H, it was wrongly shown as Sandeep Bhatta H.S. He

came to know the said mistake recently. Immediately he
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                 6</span>




approached the defendants to change the correct name, they

instructed to obtain decree. Later he got issued notice

U/Sec.80 of CPC to defendants to rectify the name; they did

not heed the request of the plaintiff.




</p><p id="p_15">     10. Ex.P.1 and 2 are Aadhaar Cards of plaintiff and his

father reveal that the name of the plaintiff's father is entered as

SURYANARAYANA BHATTA.H.
</p>
<p id="p_16">


</p><p id="p_17">     11. Ex.P.3 SSLC Marks Card of plaintiff's father reveals

that name of the plaintiff's father is entered as Suryanarayana

Bhatta. Ex.P-4 reveals that name of the plaintiff entered as

SANDEEP      BHAT.H.S     and   father   name    is   entered   as

SUBRAMANYA BHAT.H. Ex.P-5 is the birth certificate of

plaintiff name is entered as Sandeep Bhat H.S and father

name is entered as Suryanarayana Bhatta. So names of

plaintiff and his father is through oversight wrongly entered in

school records. Ex.P-6, Notice Ex.P-7, Postal receipts, Ex.P-8

to 13, Postal acknowledgment reveal that plaintiff got issued
                                                            CCH-33

records. Ex.P-14 reply letter issued by 5th defendant Director of

University board stating to approach concerned college. Ex.P-

15 is the Postal acknowledgment regarding service of notice.

However, the Defendants did not rectify




</p><p id="p_18">      12.    Evidence of plaintiff is remained un-challenged by

the defendants, even though duly service of summons and

defendants did not choose to appear and file the written

statement. Thus there is no reason to disbelieve the case of the

plaintiff.
