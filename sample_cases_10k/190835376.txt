For Petitioner(s)         :    Mr. S.S.Ladrecha.
</p><pre id="pre_1">For Respondent(s)         :



           HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE ARUN BHANSALI

                                    Order

09/05/2019

</pre><p id="p_7">     This writ petition has been filed by the petitioner on 27/2/19

aggrieved against the order dated 27/10/14 (Annex.7) passed by

the Senior Divisional Personnel Officer, North Western Railway,

Bikaner, whereby, the petitioner's son was held ineligible for

appointment in Railways.
</p>
<p id="p_8">     From the averments made in the petition, it appears that the

Railway Board framed a scheme named as Liberalized Active

Retirement Scheme for Guaranteed Employment for Safety Staff

('the LARSGESS'). The son of the petitioner being eligible for

appointment in place of the petitioner submitted an application for

appointment. A proforma of attestation form was issued to the

petitioner's son which was duly filled in by him. It is claimed that

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                    (Downloaded on 28/06/2019 at 02:29:28 AM)</span>
                                               (2 of 3)                 [CW-4398/2019]



Column no. 11 of the attestation form, due to bonafide mistake,

son of the petitioner forgot to mention the information regarding

the case registered against him under Section 12 of the Rajasthan

Public Gambling Ordinance 1949. The son of the petitioner was

called for interview, however, by order dated 27/10/14 the

candidature of the petitioner's son was rejected on account of

suppression in the attestation form. Feeling aggrieved the present

writ petition has been filed.
</p>
<p id="p_9">       At the outset, when it was put to learned counsel for the

petitioner     as   to    why       instead      of      approaching    the   Central

Administrative Tribunal ('the CAT'), the petitioner has approached

this Court, which aspect is reflected from the order dated 26/4/19

as well, various submissions were made by counsel for the

petitioner seeking to justify the maintainability of the writ petition

before this Court and that the same would not lie before the CAT.

</p><p id="p_10">       However, a perusal of the writ petition indicates the following

averments made in para 12:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">              "12. That in the circumstances referred to above,
       petitioner was having no alternative remedy but to
       approach the learned Central Administrative Tribunal,
       Jodhpur Bench, Jodhpur by way of filing Original
       Application No.290/2015. It is respectfully submitted that
       the O.A. was filed in the early of year 2015 but since then,
       the Bench is not being formed and even after passing of
       about 3 years period of time, the matter is not being heard
       by the learned С.А.Т."</blockquote><p id="p_11">

</p><p id="p_12">       It is surprising that on the one hand the original application

filed by the petitioner is pending before the CAT and on the other

hand despite the averments made in the writ petition, the learned

counsel could make submissions that the petition would lie before

this   Court    and      is   not    maintainable          before    CAT.   Such   an

action/attempt made by learned counsel cannot be approved.



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                         (Downloaded on 28/06/2019 at 02:29:28 AM)</span>
</p><p id="p_13">                                                                            (3 of 3)               [CW-4398/2019]



                                        Once the petitioner has filed original application before the

                                   competent Tribunal/Authority, there was apparently no occasion

                                   for the petitioner to have filed the present petition. Things would

                                   have been different if the aspect of pendency of petition was not

                                   disclosed by the petitioner to his counsel, however, once the said

                                   aspect has been indicated in the writ petition itself, the attempt

                                   made on the part of the learned counsel to make submissions

                                   regarding non-maintainability of the matter before the CAT is

                                   essentially an attempt to mislead the Court, which cannot be

                                   approved under any circumstances.
</p>
<p id="p_14">                                        Be that as it may, as it is apparent that the jurisdiction

                                   pertaining to the impugned order lies with the CAT, wherein,

                                   already an original application filed by the petitioner is pending,

                                   there is no reason for entertaining the petition filed by the

                                   petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_15">                                        Consequently there is no substance in the writ petition and

                                   the same is, therefore, dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_16">                                                                                         (ARUN BHANSALI),J
