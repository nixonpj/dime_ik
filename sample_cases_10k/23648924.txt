         IN THE HIGH COURT OF GUJARAT AT AHMEDABAD

          R/SPECIAL CIVIL APPLICATION NO. 16223 of 2018

================================================================
     GANESH PROTEINS (A PROPRIETARY FIRM) THROUGH VIKAS

===============================================================
Appearance:
MR TUSHAR HEMANI, ADVOCATE for MR KK TRIVEDI(934) for the
PETITIONER(s) No. 1,2
MR UTKARSH SHARMA, ASSTT. GOVT. PLEADER for the
RESPONDENT(s) No. 1,2
================================================================

 CORAM: HONOURABLE MS.JUSTICE HARSHA DEVANI
        and
        HONOURABLE DR.JUSTICE A. P. THAKER

                           Date : 18/01/2019

                       ORAL ORDER</pre>
<p id="p_1"> (PER : HONOURABLE MS.JUSTICE HARSHA DEVANI)


</p><p id="p_2">1.    Mr. Tushar Hemani, learned advocate for the petitioner
has invited the attention of the court to the additional affidavit
filed on behalf of the petitioner, to submit that the respondent
vide notice dated 29.10.2018 has attached all the bank
accounts of the petitioner, including a cash credit account
which is maintained with the Axis Bank, Navagam Branch
being Account No.918030020580275.
</p>

<p id="p_3">2.    Reference was made to the decision of this court in the
case of Kaneria Granito Ltd. v. Assistant Commissioner
of Income Tax, [2016] 241 Taxman 315 (Gujarat), wherein
the court has observed that admittedly, all the three bank
accounts were in the nature of either the cash credit account


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                               Page 1 of 3</span>
        C/SCA/16223/2018                                   ORDER




or term loan account. In other words, the accounts were
opened to enable the assessee to borrow the money from the
bank for the purpose of its business. Any money, therefore,
that the bank may make available to the assessee would
necessarily be in the nature of a loan or a cash credit facility,
in either case, would be in the nature of borrowing by the
assessee from the bank. The bank and the assessee,
therefore, do not have the debtor-creditor relationship. The
court after relying upon various decisions of other High Courts,
set aside the impugned notice of attachment. It was submitted
that therefore, the respondent was not justified in attaching
the cash credit account of the petitioner in exercise of powers
under section 45(7) of the Gujarat Value Added Tax Act, 2003.
Various other submissions have been advanced by the learned
advocate for the petitioner, however, for the purpose of
granting interim relief at this stage, it is not necessary to refer
to the other contentions in detail.
</p>

<p id="p_4">3.   On the other hand, Mr. Utkarsh Sharma, learned Assistant
Government Pleader has opposed to the grant of any relief in
favour of the petitioner. It was submitted that for the purpose
of availing the cash credit facility, the petitioner must have
furnished some sort of security to the bank and therefore, if
any amount is withdrawn from the cash credit account, the
bank would recover the same from the security which is
furnished,    which       otherwise    could   be   attached   by   the
respondent authorities.
</p>

<p id="p_5">4.   While the petition has been filed challenging the order
made under section 45(7) of the Gujarat Value Added Tax Act,
2003 whereby three bank accounts of the petitioner have been



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                 Page 2 of 3</span>

attached, for the purpose of granting interim relief, the court
has considered the request only qua the cash credit account
bearing No.918030020580275 maintained by the petitioner
with the Axis Bank.
</p>

<p id="p_6">5.     This court in Kaneria Granito Ltd. v. Assistant
Commissioner of Income Tax (supra) has categorically held
that a cash credit account would be in the nature of borrowing
by the assessee from the bank, and that the bank and the
assessee,       therefore,   do     not         have   the    debtor-creditor
relationship. Under the circumstances, when no amount lying
in the cash credit account belongs to the petitioner, the
question of attaching such account under section 45(7) of the
Gujarat Value Added Tax Act, 2003 does not appear to be
justified. Under the circumstances, by way of interim relief, the
respondents are directed to forthwith release the cash credit
account maintained by the petitioner with the Axis Bank,
Navagam Branch being Account No.918030020580275.
Stand over to 23rd January, 2019.
