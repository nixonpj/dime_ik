                                 CAN 2317 of 2019
                                          In
                                 M.A.T. 250 of 2019

                          The State of West Bengal and Ors.

Mr. Tanmay Chowdhury................For the appellants/
                                 applicants.
Mr. Manas Kumar Kundu,
Ms. Sharmila Deb,
Mr. Abdus Salam........................For the respondent</pre>
<p id="p_1">                                  no. 1.
</p><p id="p_2">Mr. Sandip Kumar Bhattacharya,
Mr. Suman Basu.........................For the respondent
                                   no. 3.
</p>
<p id="p_3">        M.A.T. 250 of 2019 is directed against an order of dismissal of the

appellants' writ petition [W.P. 26930(W) of 2017] by a learned Judge of this Court

by an order dated 7th January, 2019 at the threshold. CAN 2317 of 2019 is an

application for stay filed in the appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_4">        Having    heard     Mr.    Chowdhury,     learned     advocate    for   the

appellants/applicants (hereafter the appellants), we are of the considered opinion

that the appeal itself may be decided having regard to the short issue that

emerged for consideration before the learned Judge. The respondents are not

called upon to answer.
</p>
<p id="p_5">        It is not in dispute that the appellants and the respondent no. 8 are at

loggerheads; while the appellants are the owners of an immovable property, the

respondent no. 8 is the developer. A civil suit instituted by the appellants against
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                          2</span>




the respondent no. 8 having failed, an appeal was carried albeit unsuccessfully.

We are now informed that the second appeal is pending. It is at this stage that

the appellants invoked the writ jurisdiction of this Court to arrest the alleged

unauthorised construction being raised by the respondent no. 8 in pursuance of

the development agreement that had been executed by and between the parties.

</p><p id="p_6">      The learned Judge upon hearing the parties was of the following view:

</p><p id="p_7">            "Although the submission of Mr. Chowdhury may be immediately
      attractive on the limited point as sought to be raised by him connected to
      the invalidity of the sanctioned plan, on a larger consideration of the issues
      this Court is of the clear view that the suit and the appeal having been
      played out by the parties to the full, it was always open to Mr.
      Chowdhury's client to have taken the points and adopted suitable
      proceedings before the civil court/forum in seisin of the foundational
      dispute.
</p><p id="p_8">            This Court has a conscious responsibility to avoid multiplicity of
      proceedings. This Court must also observe that any construction sought to
      be raised in the property in issue must find its place on the authority of the
      agreement between the principal parties, viz. the petitioner and the private
      respondent no. 8, which is sub-judice in the civil proceedings."

      Law is well settled that even if a party invoking the writ jurisdiction of the

court sets up a strong case for interference, relief does not automatically follow.

In an appropriate case, having regard to public policy as well as public interest, a

learned Judge would be justified and acting well within his jurisdiction if he

refuses to entertain such writ petition by assigning cogent reasons.

</p><p id="p_9">      As has been noted by His Lordship, it could well be so that the building

plan on the basis of which the respondent no. 8 has been raising construction

has spent out its life and an extension of its validity may not have been obtained.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                            3</span>




Although in normal cases, a writ court would have been justified in entertaining

a writ petition seeking to voice a grievance that the competent statutory authority

is remiss in taking action against the person responsible for raising such

construction without a valid plan, pendency of the civil proceedings between the

private parties is a factor, which was rightly taken into consideration by the

learned Judge while refusing to entertain the writ petition.

</p><p id="p_10">      It is not disputed before us that a prayer was made by the appellants

before the civil court to restrain the respondent no. 8 from proceeding with the

construction but the suit/appeal having failed, there is presently no order of

injunction operating in the field. The first appellate decree having been carried in

appeal before this Court, the grievance of the appellants can well be looked into

by this Court in a different jurisdiction and it would be against public policy to

entertain a fresh proceeding in another jurisdiction of the self-same court.

</p><p id="p_11">      We approve the order passed by the learned Judge dismissing the writ

petition and dismiss the appeal as well as the application, leaving the private

parties to urge their respective points before the appropriate Bench.

</p><p id="p_12">      There shall be no order for costs.
