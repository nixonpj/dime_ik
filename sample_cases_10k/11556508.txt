ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">	By consent, the writ petition is taken up for final disposal.  Mr  Mr.P.Kannan Kumar, learned Standing counsel accepts notice on behalf  of the respondent.
</p>

<p id="p_2">	2		The 1st petitioner retired from the services of the respondent / Corporation on 31.03.2014 as a Special Grade Conductor and the 2nd respondent retired from the service as Senior Checking Inspector on 31.05.2014 and though the petitioners have retired from service about two years back, the retiral/terminal benefits such as Gratuity, Earned Leave Surrender Salary including Medical Leave; Dearness Allowance arrears ; Commutation and Arrears of Settlement salary difference and other benefits, have not been paid and in this regard, the petitioners have also submitted a representation to the respondent dated 26.12.2016 and despite receipt and acknowledgment, no orders have been passed and hence, the petitioners came forward to file the present writ petition.
</p>
<p id="p_3">	3		The learned counsel appearing for the petitioners would submit that a similar issue arose for consideration before a Division Bench of this Court in WA[MD] No.383 to 457/2015 [K.Rajendran and others Vs. The Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation, Madurai Limited rep. by the Managing Director, Madurai-10 and others] and the Division Bench, vide judgment dated 12.06.2015, has ordered the amounts to be paid in twelve equal monthly instalments with an interest @ 6% per annum and also with a default interest and prays for similar orders.
</p>
<p id="p_4">	4		Heard the submissions of  Mr.P.Kannan Kumar, learned Standing counsel appearing for the respondent.
</p>
<p id="p_5">	5		This Court has taken into consideration the said judgment and also the stand of the respondents including the Administrative Department  in its order dated 19.01.2017  made in WP.No.42555/2016 [A.Annamalai Vs. The Managing Director, Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation Limited, Salem and others] and issued necessary directions and for the purpose of disposal of the cases, it is relevant to extract the common judgment made in the above cited writ appeal :-
</p><p id="p_6">	The learned Additional Advocate General submits that he has obtained written instructions vide letter No.7945/B/2015-2 dated 11/06/2015 that the terminal benefits of the appellants would be settled through twelve equal monthly installments, carrying interest of 6% p.a.
</p><p id="p_7">	2. The said statement is thus taken on record and the respondents will be bound by the same.  We have to keep in mind the judicial pronouncement of the Honourable Supreme Court in D.D.Tewari (D) Thr. Lrs. Vs. Utta Haryana Bujli Vitran Nigam Limited &amp; Ors [2014 (e) scale -78] wherein it is held that in case of any delay in making the payment of the installments, the interest payable would become 18% p.a., for the delayed period apart from any other remedy which may be available to the appellants for non-compliance  of undertaking given to this Court.
</p><p id="p_8">	3. The instalments to be paid from July 2015 and each instalments should be paid on or before 7th of each month.
</p><p id="p_9">	4. The Writ Appeals are disposed of accordingly.  No costs.  Consequently, the connected miscellaneous petitions are closed.

	6		In the light of the above facts and circumstances, the respondent is directed to settle the retiral/terminal benefits to the petitioners in twelve equal monthly installments commencing from 1st May, 2017 bearing interest at the rate of 6% per annum and in the event of default, the interest payable will become 18% per annum.  The respondent, apart from paying arrears of pension, shall also continue to pay the pension amount due and payable to the petitioners without any default.
</p>

<p id="p_10">	7		The writ petition stands disposed of with the above direction.  No costs.
