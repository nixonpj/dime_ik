            released on bail, (iii) that the bailor shall also state on affidavit that

            he will inform the court concerned if the petitioner is implicated in

            any other case of similar nature after his release in the present

            proceeding for cancellation of bail on the ground of misuse, (iv) that

            the petitioner will give an undertaking that he will receive the police

            papers on the given date and be present on date fixed for charge

            and if he fails to do so on two given dates and delays the trial in
