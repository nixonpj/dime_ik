                                  have   been   restrained   from   admitting   student   to   first

                                  next  three years College  would be  completely closed

                                  deficiencies   exist   which   warrant   closer,   we   fail   to
                                  understand   how   respondent/university   can   bear
                                  education being imparted to second year or third year
                                  students   by   such   Colleges.     The   University,   in   that
                                  situation,   could have  closed down  the  entire  College
                                  and   shifted   students   to   some   other   institution.

                                  usually pass proper orders.     As the   University have
                                  started functioning since last 7 years, we refrain from
                                  making any general observation.  We however feel that
                                  deliberately   an   incorrect   or wrong order has been
                                  passed   so   as   to   enable   petitioners   to   approach   this
