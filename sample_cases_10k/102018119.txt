</pre>

<p id="p_1">1.               Petitioner has filed the present petition U/S 9 of the
Arbitration &amp; <a href="/doc/1306164/" id="a_1">Conciliation Act</a>, 1996 claiming that the respondent had
approached the petitioner company seeking grant of loan for purchase
of vehicle i.e. Mercedes E350                      CDI, bearing registration No.
DL4CNA5522, Engine No. 65294041097918 &amp; Chassis No.
WDC1641222A714533. On the request of the respondent an
amount of Rs. 2500000/- was sanctioned as loan vide loan agreement
dated 29.09.2013. The respondent agreed to repay the loan amount
in 36 equated monthly installments of Rs.86053/-. Necessary
documents in that regard were claimed to have been executed by the
respondent. As per case of the petitioner, the petitioner had duly paid


ARBT No.  17/2017          HDFC Bank Ltd. Vs. Baljeet Singh Education Society            Page : 1/3
 the financed amount to the respondent against vehicle i.e. Mercedes
E350 CDI, bearing registration No. DL4CNA5522, Engine No.
65294041097918 &amp; Chassis No. WDC1641222A714533 and the
said vehicle was under exclusive hypothecation of the petitioner. The
respondent started defaulting in repayment, for which a loan recall
notice dated 19.12.2016 was sent to the respondent. It was further
claimed that there existed an arbitration clause in the agreement
entered into between the parties and the dispute was to be settled by
arbitration. The petitioner had prayed that Mr. Dipanshu Rastogi,
Authorised Representative of the petitioner company may be
appointed as Receiver to take possession of the vehicle in question.
</p>

<p id="p_2">2.               Vide order dated 16.01.2017 passed by this Court,
Mr. Dipanshu Rastogi, Authorised Representative of the petitioner
company was appointed as receiver to take the interim possession of
the vehicle in question.
</p>

<p id="p_3">3.               I have heard the Ld. counsel for the petitioner. Notice was
issued to the respondent but he could not be served at the given
address. Even vehicle could not be repossessed as per the statement
of the Ld. Counsel for the petitioner. Ld. Counsel for the petitioner has
further submitted that he does not intend to continue with the present
petition for the reason that arbitration proceedings have been initiated
against the respondent vide notice dated 17.01.2017. He further prays
that interim order may be made absolute i.e. till the final outcome of
the arbitration proceedings and the petition may be disposed of.
</p>

<p id="p_4">4.               Perusal of record reveals that as per Arbitration clause, in
the Loan Agreement entered into between the parties, all disputes,

ARBT No.  17/2017          HDFC Bank Ltd. Vs. Baljeet Singh Education Society            Page : 2/3
 differences or claims arising out of the agreement shall be settled by
arbitration in accordance with provisions of Arbitration &amp; <a href="/doc/1306164/" id="a_2">Conciliation
Act</a>, 1996. As per <a href="/doc/1120409/" id="a_3">Section 9</a> of the Arbitration &amp; <a href="/doc/1306164/" id="a_4">Conciliation Act</a>, a
party can approach the Court either before or during the arbitration
proceedings or at any time after making of the award for interim
injunction or appointment of a Receiver. Since the arbitration
proceedings have already been initiated in the case, the earlier order
dated 16.01.2017 is made absolute, till the final outcome of the
arbitration proceedings. However, in case the vehicle is repossessed,
the receiver shall be duty bound                    to maintain the vehicle in same
condition till appropriate order in that regard is passed by Ld.
Arbitrator. The petitioner shall not sell, dismantle or create any
encumbrance over the vehicle till further order of the court.                                 The
petitioner shall ensure that the vehicle is parked properly and safely.
Petition stands disposed of accordingly.
