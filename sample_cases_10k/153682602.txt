No. 37/1


Rimple Wadhera


Versus 


Gaurav Wadhera


21.08.2014


                                         ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">1.            By this order, I shall decide an application U/s 23 of the Protection 

of   Women   from   <a href="/doc/542601/" id="a_1">Domestic   Violence   Act</a>   2005   filed   by   the   Complainant 

alongwith the main Petition U/s 12 <a href="/doc/542601/" id="a_2">PWDV Act</a>. The brief facts of the case are:­

              The complainant got married with respondent no1 on 04.12.2003. 

Out of this wedlock one child namely Divayansh was born.  It had been alleged 

that respondents used to taunt her for bringing less dowry articles. She was also 

beaten by the respondents.  Her husband developed illicit extra marital relation 

also. It was further alleged that her father was pressurized to give one property 

in Gurgaon in the name of respondent no. 1. Ultimately on 29.01.2014 she was 

thrown out from her matrimonial home.
</p>
<p id="p_2">              It has been averred that the respondent no. 1 along with his brother 

and father is running a business in the name of Diwas Electric Company at 

Bhagirath   Place.     They   also   have   two   factories   at   Dilshad   Garden   and   in 
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                                 2</span>

Bhiwadi. It has been further mentioned that after the production in factories a 

lot   of   scrap   is   generated   which   is   later   on   sold   and   respondents   earn   Rs. 

20,000­30,000/­   per   day   after   selling   the   scrap.   The   respondent   no.1   also 

opened another business in the name and style of Gardeina Foods and Grills at 

Gurgaon.
</p>
<p id="p_3">               She   has   further   stated   that   apart   from   above   he   also   run   the 

business  of  sale,  purchase  and  renting  of properties  in the  name of  "World 

Associate and Developers India". Respondent has a very lavish life style. He is 

having an Audi 6 Series Car which is not less than Rs. 50 Lacs. He is having 

membership   of   Gym   Fitness   First   at   Gurgaon   and   hotel   membership   of 

Raddison. He is having bank accounts in several bank. The child was admitted 

for   studying   in   Pathways   International   School   and   his   monthly   fee   is   Rs. 

30,000/­. 
</p>
<p id="p_4">               On the basis of above mentioned facts, complainant has claimed an 

amount of Rs. 5 Lacs towards her maintenance as well as for her child. She has 

also claimed Rs. 50,000/­ towards rental expenses. 
</p>
<p id="p_5">

</p><p id="p_6">2.             Vide   detailed   reply,   all   the   allegations   were   refuted   by   the 

respondent.   However,   he   did   not   dispute   the   marriage   and   the   fact   that 

presently child is under the care and custody of the complainant. It was also 

contented that complainant is a working lady and earning well and hence, she is 

not entitled for relief of any maintenance. 
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                                3</span><p id="p_7">

</p><p id="p_8">3.            Qua his financial status, he stated that   earlier he was doing the 

business of electric goods and now he is trading in property and his income is 

not more than Rs. 50,000/­ to Rs. 60,000/­ pm. He denied doing any business as 

alleged by complainant. He also denied having any membership anywhere. Not 

only this, he also refused having any credit card except one with HDFC Bank. 

He stated that he is only having one account in HDFC Bank. It was also stated 

by him that he is not the owner of any of the properties and he is only having 

25% share  in joint holding of property bearing no. J­969, Ansal Palam Vihar, 

Gurgaon. He denied having Audi / Skoda / Honda City / Maruti Swift / Skoda 

Fabia / Renault Duster. It was mentioned by him that he sold the car Audi A6 

and a Laura before the complainant left the matrimonial house in the year 2013 

to repay the loans. Not only this, he further declined  having made any world 

trip or visited USA or London every year by business class. 



</p><p id="p_9">4.            He also stated that the office which was on rent has already been 

surrendered by the respondent no.1 on 07.07.2014. 
</p>
<p id="p_10">

</p><p id="p_11">5.            Afterwards   both   the   parties   were   directed   to   file   their   affidavit 

regarding   the   financial   status   wherein   respondent   reiterated   his   submission. 

Complainant   also   stated   herself   to   be   non   working   but   she   stated   in   the 

affidavit that she did the job of teaching in Play School for a period of three 

months. 
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                                 4</span><p id="p_12">

</p><p id="p_13">6.             Arguments heard. Case file perused. 
</p>
<p id="p_14">

</p><p id="p_15">7.             With respect to his income and financial status, the respondent has 

admitted   that   he   is   having   25%   undivided   share   in   Palam   Vihar   Gurgaon 

property. He also admitted that earlier he was trading in electronic goods and at 

present he is trading in property. It was also admitted by him that he earns an 

amount   of   Rs.   50,000/­   ­   Rs.   60,000/­   pm.   But   surprisingly   at   the   time   of 

arguments as well as at the time of filing of written submission the respondent 

no.1 has categorically stated that, "he does not have income of more than 4 

Lacs   per   annum   as   shown   in   ITR."   Now   both   the   submissions   are   self 

contradictory as if I calculate the respondent's admitted annual income per 

month salary then also his annual income comes to more than Rs. 6 Lacs 

per annum. Apart from above, the ITR filed for the year 2010­11 reflects 

the gross income of respondent as Rs. 4,50,200/­ per annum, however, in 

the year 2012­13 it is Rs. 10,50,580/­ per annum. 
</p>
<p id="p_16">

</p><p id="p_17">8.             It is the matter of common knowledge that it is usual tendency of 

the parties that they do not disclose their income truthfully especially where the 

parties   are   self   employed   persons   or   persons   employed   in   the   unorganized 

sector.
</p>
<p id="p_18"> 

</p><p id="p_19">9.             Though respondent himself admitted that he is trading in property 
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                                  5</span>

but he did not file any documentary proof or visiting card in support of his 

submission. He also did not file the document pertaining to his previous job. 



</p><p id="p_20">10.            The   details   of   bank   accounts   of   respondent   also   reflect 

withdrawal of substantial amount since December 2013. The respondent has 

mentioned   in   his   affidavit   that   he   is   paying   the   installments   towards   loan 

amount of Rs. 10 Lacs from ICICI Bank and loan amount of Rs. 10 Lacs from 

Punjab and Sind Bank. The respondent filed account statement from 2005­06 

of   ICICI   bank   with   respect   to   home   loan   account   but   he   failed   to   file   the 

current status of loan taken from ICICI Bank. Qua the other loan amount, the 

document   filed   by   the   respondent   from   Punjab   and   Sind   Bank   reflects   the 

account   name   M/s   G.H.   Electric   Company,   1833,   Bhagirath   Palace   though 

nowhere he has mentioned that he was/is running business with such name and 

style. 
</p>
<p id="p_21">

</p><p id="p_22">11.            Further   as   per   the   document   filed   by   the   respondent   he   was 

residing on rent at the rate of Rs. 35000/­ from 01.03.2011 to 01.02.2012 and 

as per affidavit it is Rs. 22,000/­ pm now. 
</p>
<p id="p_23">

</p><p id="p_24">12.            He   further   admits   that   his   expenditure   on   travel   including   out 

station including foreign is Rs. 1.5 Lac per annum. 
</p>
<p id="p_25">

</p><p id="p_26">13.            It is beyond my imagination that a person getting only Rs. 4 
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                                 6</span>

Lacs per annum (as mentioned by respondent) is incurring expenses of Rs. 

1.5 lacs per annum on traveling. Not only this, out of the above admitted 

annual income respondent is bearing the educational expenses of his child 

who is studying in Pathways International School. 
</p>
<p id="p_27">

</p><p id="p_28">14.            Further the respondent  has mentioned  in his affidavit  that  he is 

travelling   by   public   vehicle.   It   is  highly  unbelievable   that  a  person  who  is 

admittedly owned Audi A6 car (which has been stated to be already sold out) 

now having no vehicle. It is the matter of common knowledge a persons always 

work   for   betterment   and   not   for   stepping   down.   The   picture   of   the   house 

wherein he is having 25% share and the self admitted facts itself reflects the 

status of the respondent. 
</p>
<p id="p_29">

</p><p id="p_30">15.            Hence from the above, it is clear that respondent has not left any 

stone unturned to hide his actual income.  
</p>
<p id="p_31">

</p><p id="p_32">15.            In   view   of   the   above,  I  assess  that  respondent  must  be  earning 

approximately Rs. 1,80,000/­ to Rs. 2/­ Lacs per month. 



</p><p id="p_33">16.            Coming to the income of complainant, it is the stand of respondent 

that  complainant  is a working  woman. She is working in artificial  jewelery 

business   as   Free   Lancer.   He   also   filed   one   card   and   one   visiting   card   of 
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                                 7</span>

complainant. He has relied upon the ITR alleged to be filed by the complainant 

for the year 2013­14 wherein her gross income is Rs. 4,30,250/­. It was also 

stated that as she is earning well, hence she is not entitled for any maintenance. 



</p><p id="p_34">17.            On the other hand, complainant categorically denied running any 

business. However, it was stated by the complainant that she did the job as a 

Play School Teacher for three months in Gurgaon and she got Rs. 35,350/­ (in 

total) for those three months. She further stated that as the child is of young 

age, hence she is not able to do any job. It was further stated argued that card, 

visiting   card   and   the   ITRs   are   nothing   but   the   forged   documents   filed   by 

respondent in order to avoid his liability to maintain the complainant and the 

child.   She   further   categorically   denied   having  filed   any   ITRs   as   she   is   not 

working. It was also stated that she has already filed the complaint against the 

concerned Chartered Accountant.
</p>
<p id="p_35">

</p><p id="p_36">18.            Coming to card and visiting card, in the front part of the visiting 

card filed by the respondent, it finds mentioned:­  Rimple Wadhera, Address  

GH­3/1A, Gurgaon 1, Sector 22, Near CNG Pump, Gurgaon, Haryana and at 

the back  of  the said  visiting  card it  is  written:­  Fine  Jewelery  Collections,  

deals  in all  kinds  of artificial  and diamond jewelery  and paintings, Work  

from   home.   One   more   card   filed   by   respondent   bearing   several   photos   of 

artificial rings, earrings, bracelets, necklace and in the front as well as the back 
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                                  8</span>

of the said card the name, phone numbers and address of the complainant have 

been mentioned in the same font which has been mentioned in the visiting card. 



</p><p id="p_37">19.            Even for a moment, I consider the submission of complainant as 

true that the ITR was never filed by the complainant then also I find it very 

difficult to ignore the above visiting cards. These cards prima facie reflect that 

she is working from home.
</p>
<p id="p_38">

</p><p id="p_39">20.            Coming to the income of complainant, respondent has relied upon 

the ITRs of 2012­13 wherein her gross income has been shown as Rs. 4 Lacs 

per   annum.   The   filing   of   said   ITR   is   already   in  dispute.   It  is   important   to 

mention here that the ITR on which the respondent is relying upon saying that 

it   was   filed   by   the   complainant   bears   the   address   of   South   Patel   Nager, 

however   the   address   on   the   visiting   card   and   on   the   other   card   is   totally 

different. Therein the complainant's address is GH3/1A, Gurgaon, Sector 22, 

near CNG pump. At the cost of repetition it is again noted that the visiting card 

itself finds mentioned that the complainant is working from home. There is no 

explanation as to why the address is different in ITR and in the visiting card 

when   it   was   allegedly   filed   by   complainant  while  working   from  her  home. 

Moreover, one more ITR was filed of the same year 2012­2013 which bears the 

name of complainant but it is totally blank.
</p>
<p id="p_40">

</p><p id="p_41">21.            All the above certainly creates a doubt on the filing of ITR by the 
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                             9</span>

complainant as alleged by the respondent. 
</p>
<p id="p_42">

</p><p id="p_43">22.          Considering   the   above   in   mind,   I   am   of   the   view   that   the 

complainant is working from home but she is not earning much as she does not 

have any office. Moreover, she has to look after one minor child also. In these 

circumstances, I assess that she must be earning approximately Rs. 1 to 1.5 lacs 

per annum though respondent is earning much more than the complainant. 



</p><p id="p_44">23.          Undoubtedly,   the   complainant   and   her   child   has   every   right   to 

enjoy the same status equivalent to the respondent husband. 



</p><p id="p_45">24.          In Annurita Vohra Vs. Sandeep Vohra : 2004 (3) AD 252, it 

has been held that the family income should be divided equally between all 

the family members entitled to maintenance with one extra portion/share 

being allotted to the earning spouse since extra expenses would necessarily 

occur.
</p>
<p id="p_46">

</p><p id="p_47">25.          In view of the principal laid down in the above cited judgment,  I 

deem it appropriate to direct the respondent No.1 to pay monthly sum of Rs.

50,000/­   towards   the   maintenance   of   complainant   which   includes   rental 

charges for alternative accommodation,   upto 10th of each English Calender 

month from the date of filing of this application till the final disposal of the 
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                                      10</span>

case   as   interim   maintenance   to   the   applicant.     The   respondent   is   further 

directed to clear the arrears of maintenance within five months from the date of 

this order.     The amount paid or payable   by the respondent to the petitioner 

either in this case or in any other proceedings towards her maintenance shall be 

adjusted accordingly.   
</p>
<p id="p_48">

</p><p id="p_49">26.           Coming to the maintenance of the child, no doubt both the parents 

have to share the responsibility of the child where both of them are working 

and earning equally. But in the present case, looking at the income and status of 

respondent,   the   complainant   is   earning   only   a   meager   amount.   Hence, 

respondent is directed to make the monthly payment of Rs.40,000/­ towards the 

maintenance of child  till the final disposal of petition.
