            Dated this the 03rd day of January, 2017



                         JUDGMENT
</pre>


<p id="p_1">     Petitioners have submitted Ext. P3 application seeking

mutation of the property, ad-measuring 104 cents, situated

in Survey No. 2785/6 of Kadakampally Village. According to

the petitioners, petitioners have secured Ext. P1 decree,

which was taken in appeal by the aggrieved parties and

suffered Ext. P2 judgment of dismissal. It is the contention

of the petitioners that the subject matter has become final

and thereupon only the petitioners have submitted Ext. P3

application seeking to effect mutation of the property

covered by the decree.
</p>
<p id="p_2">     2.   Having heard learned counsel for the petitioners

and learned Senior Government Pleader, I think it is only

appropriate that a direction is issued to the third

W.P.(C). NO. 38494 OF 2016
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                             2</span>

respondent to take on board Ext. P3 application and

consider the same, in accordance with law, after, providing

notice of hearing to the petitioners or any other interested

or affected persons, and attain a logical conclusion, within

three months from the date of receipt of a copy of this

judgment.
</p>
<p id="p_3">     3.     Learned Senior Government Pleader submitted

that against Ext. P2 judgment, R.S.A. No. 1247/2013 is

pending before this Court. It is a well settled proposition in

law, so far as the transfer of registry is concerned mere

pendency of a suit, appeal proceedings or revenue

proceedings is not a bar for considering the application

seeking mutation of the property. However, if any change

occurs, consequent to the passing of judgment or decree or

orders by Courts or any statutory authority, the authority

under the Transfer of Registry Rules is vested with enough

and more powers to reconsider the issue of transfer of

registry. Recording the same, there will be a direction to

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                             3</span>

the authority concerned to consider the application as

mentioned above.
</p>
<p id="p_4">     Writ petition is disposed of accordingly.
