CORAM: HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE MADHURESH PRASAD
                              ORAL JUDGMENT
Date: 15-02-2018

                Heard counsel for the petitioner. None appears for the

   State.
</p>
<p id="p_10">               2. Charge memo dated 29.09.1999(Praptra Kha) was served

   on the petitioner. The two allegations made against the petitioner were

   that when an order of transfer dated 24.03.1999 was served on the

   petitioner and he was relieved then in retaliation to the same he

   misbehaved with the District Stastical Officer and abused him with

   filthy language and threatened to kill him outside the office on the

   same very date. The other allegation is of unauthorized absence from

   06.02.1999 to 13.03.1999.
</p><p id="p_11"> Patna High Court CWJC No.6662 of 2004 dt.15-02-2018

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                         2/7</span>




</p><p id="p_12">                      3. The petitioner has alleged that it is a case of his false

        implication as the District Stastical Officer was acting malafide

        against the petitioner. He further submits that inadmissible evidence

        in the form of deposition of witnesses who were not concerned with

        the incident has been taken into consideration by the Presenting

        Officer. He submits that alleged period of unauthorized absence i.e.

        06.02.1999 to 13.03.1999 was unsustainable inasmuch as during said

        period the employees enmasse including the petitioner were on strike.

</p><p id="p_13">                      4. He submits that the defence raised by him before the

        Enquiry Officer has not been considered and the Enquiry Officer

        submitted enquiry report dated 18.12.2000 on the basis of surmises

        and conjectures and found the charges to be proved.

</p><p id="p_14">                      5. Even though all the aforesaid submissions were urged

        before the Disciplinary authority, the disciplinary authority by a

        cryptic order dated 06.06.2001 has accepted the enquiry report

        without considering the various assertions raised by the writ

        petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_15">                      6. Being aggrieved by the aforesaid action, the petitioner

        had approached this Court by filing writ petition. The writ petition

        was numbered as C.W.J.C. No. 8636 of 2001. The same was disposed

        off in view of the pendency of statutory appeal before the appellate

        authority. The specific direction by this court was that the appellate

        authority shall consider the questions of law and dispose off the
 Patna High Court CWJC No.6662 of 2004 dt.15-02-2018

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                         3/7</span>




        appeal within a period of six weeks. The appeal was disposed off

        pursuant thereto by a cryptic order similar to that as the order passed

        by the disciplinary authority. Once again the petitioner was compelled

        to approach this Court by filing a writ petition. The same was

        numbered as C.W.J.C. No. 1533 of 2003.
</p>
<p id="p_16">                     7. Counsel for the State has tried to sustain the order of the

        appellate authority by saying that the same has been passed in light of

        the directions issued in C.W.J.C. No 1533 of 2003.

</p><p id="p_17">                     8. This Court vide order dated 17.04.2003 in the said

        C.W.J.C. No. 1533 of 2003 has observed that the order of dismissal

        from service is the extreme penalty and set aside the order passed by

        the appellate authority, and the matter was remanded back to the

        appellate forum to rehear the appeal after due notice to the petitioner

        and to pass speaking order in accordance with law. The petitioner has

        submitted his detailed submissions before the appellate authority on

        12.07.2003. The same is annexure 22 of the instant writ petition. Once

        again the appellate authority by the impugned order dated 27.10.2003

        has disposed off the appeal by a cryptic order.

</p><p id="p_18">                     9. Regarding the punishment of dismissal from service

        being disproportionate, the appellate authority in paragraph nos. 7 and

        9 of the appellate order specifically concluded that even if the charges

        are proved then such punishment would not be sustainable and would

        be disproportionate to the charges.           The appellate authority has
 Patna High Court CWJC No.6662 of 2004 dt.15-02-2018

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                         4/7</span>




        considered the fact that the punishment of dismissal from service was

        disproportionate. In the facts and circumstances of the case, relying

        upon the petitioner's past performance he has come to a definite

        conclusion       that     the    punishment       order     of    dismissal      was

        disproportionate to the charges even if the charges are taken to be

        established and has found the punishment unsustainable.

</p><p id="p_19">                     10. All other contentions raised by the petitioner have been

        decided by one paragraph order specifically paragraph 8 of the order

        which reads as follows :
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">                        "nksuksa gh i{kksa dks lquus ds ckn foHkkxh; dk;Zokgh dh ewy

</p><p id="p_21">                     11. Perusal of the aforesaid paragraph 8 of the order of the

        appellate authority shows that there is no definite affirmation of the

        order of the Disciplinary Authority. The conclusion which has been

        arrived at is not a definite finding and is based on conjectures.

        However, he has proceeded to impose the punishment of withholding

        of five annual increments without cumulative effect and denying

        payments other than the subsistence allowance for the period of

        suspension i.e., upto the order of the appellate authority i.e.
 Patna High Court CWJC No.6662 of 2004 dt.15-02-2018

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                         5/7</span>




        27.10.2003 when the petitioner's suspension has been revoked.

</p><p id="p_22">                     12. In so far as the findings of the Appellate Authority

        favourable to         the    petitioner       regarding the dismissal being

        disproportionate to the charges, no grievance is raised and therefore,

        to that extent the order of the appellate authority requires no

        interference.
</p>
<p id="p_23">                     13. In view of the said findings, the petitioner continues in

        service of the respondents. However, to the extent that the appellate

        authority has upheld the order of the disciplinary authority without

        reference to any material and without assigning any reasons in support

        of the conclusion, this Court would observe that the same is not

        sustainable. The various assertions made before the appellate

        authority have been taken note of in paragraphs 2-5 of the impugned

        order. However, without dealing with any of the assertions and

        without assigning any reasons in support of the conclusion, the order

        modifying the punishment to withholding of five annual increments

        without cumulative effect and to deprive the petitioner of his benefits

        other than the subsistence allowance for the period of suspension, is

        legally unsustainable to that extent as the same shows total non-

        consideration of the petitioner's appeal and the conclusions are

        perverse.
</p>
<p id="p_24">                     14. It is needless to say that assigning of reasons is an

        essential function of such authorities which are performing an
 Patna High Court CWJC No.6662 of 2004 dt.15-02-2018

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                         6/7</span>




        adjudicatory function as the same excludes the scope of arbitrariness.

        The importance of assigning reasons has been reiterated by this Court

        and the Apex Court on various occasions. Reasons for the decisions

        have to be stated, otherwise the decision would be arbitrary and

        violative of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_1">Article 14</a> of the Constitution of India. The requirement to

        give reasons in adjudicatory orders is of the essence and goes to the

        root of the order. When no reasons are given by the concerned

        authorities (as in the instant case by the appellate authority), in

        support of the order made by it, the same is indicative of non-

        application of mind by the authorities to the matter in question. The

        appellate authority has totally failed to take into consideration the

        grounds pleaded by the petitioner in his appeal as no reasons have

        been assigned dealing with the grounds urged before the appellate

        authority.
</p>
<p id="p_25">                     15. The importance of assigning reasons has been reiterated

        time and again by this Court and the Apex Court Such non-speaking

        order is unsustainable in law.
</p>
<p id="p_26">                     16. In this connection this Court would refer to and rely

        upon the judgment of the Apex Court in the case of <a href="/doc/84566570/" id="a_2">Ravi Yashwant

        Bhoir vs. Collector</a> reported in 2012 (4) SCC 407 wherein the

        established legal principles of recording of reasons so as to ensure

        compliance with Principles of Natural Justice and fairness and to

        exclude arbitrariness, has been reiterated with reference to the earlier
              Patna High Court CWJC No.6662 of 2004 dt.15-02-2018

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                                      7/7</span>




                      judgments which have been discussed therein.

</p><p id="p_27">                                  17. The order to the extent it imposes withholding of five

                      annual increments with cumulative effect and to deprive the petitioner

                      of his benefits other than the subsistence allowance for the period of

                      suspension are clearly legally unsustainable and are hereby quashed.
