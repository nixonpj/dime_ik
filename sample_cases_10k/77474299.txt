                                       SA No.151 of 2005
                            Sarjugia Devi Wife of Sri Jag Narain Rai resident of
                            Village Dighikala P.O and P.S. Hajipur Dist. Vaishali

</p><p id="p_3">04   28.04.2009                         Heard learned counsel for the appellant.

</p><p id="p_4">                                    2. This second appeal has been filed by the sole

                  defendant- appellant-appellant challenging the judgments and decree of

                  both the learned courts below.
</p>
<p id="p_5">                                     3. The matter arises out of Title Suit no.20 of 1989

                  which was filed by the sole plaintiff-respondent-respondent for specific

                  performance of contract vide agreement dated 05.04.1986 (exhibit 2),

                  said to have been executed by the defendant in favour of the plaintiff

                  with respect to the suit property, and for other ancillary reliefs.

</p><p id="p_6">                                     4. The aforesaid title suit was decreed on contest by

                  the learned Subordinate Judge I, Hajipur vide his judgment and decree

                  dated 09.03.1994. Against the aforesaid judgment and decree of the trial

                  court, the defendant filed Title Appeal no.21 of 1994( 13/1995) which

                  was dismissed on contest by the learned Additional District Judge IV,

                  Vaishali at Hajipur, vide his judgment and decree dated 30.11.1995.

</p><p id="p_7">                                    5. After considering the arguments of the parties as

                  well as the materials on record including the impugned judgments and

                  decree of both the learned courts below, it is quite apparent that although
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                        -2-</span>




the defendant challenged the genuiness of the said agreement for sale

dated 05.04.1986 (exhibit 2) but the learned courts below after

considering the pleadings and evidence of the parties         came to the

specific conclusion that it was genuine, valid and no fraud had been

played for its execution. So far readiness and willingness of the plaintiff

was concerned both the learned courts below arrived at a finding of fact

that the plaintiff was from the very beginning ready and willing to pay

rest of the consideration money but the defendant evaded to receive the

same and to execute the sale deed in favour of the plaintiff for the suit

land.
</p>
<p id="p_8">                   6. Learned counsel for the appellant has raised

emphasis upon the letters exhibits D/2, D/3 and D/4 in which the

plaintiff had allegedly asked the defendant to return his money. Even if

the said letters are presumed to be genuine it does not mean that in any

circumstance such letters could finally prove that the plaintiff was not

ready and willing to pay the amount as even in case of frustration due to

lingering attitude of the defendant such statement could have been made,

but considering other evidence of the parties both oral and documentary

both the learned courts below came to the specific concurrent findings

of facts that the plaintiff was throughout ready and willing to pay his part

of the contract.
</p>
<p id="p_9">                   7. In the said circumstance, this Court does not find

any illegality in the impugned judgments and decree of the learned

courts below, nor does it find any substantial question of law involved in

the instant second appeal.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                -3-</span><p id="p_10">




</p><p id="p_11">                           8. In addition to the aforesaid issue regarding merit of

         the case, the instant second appeal is hopelessly barred by law of

         limitation as against the judgment and decree of the court of appeal

         below dated 30.11.1995, the instant second appeal has been filed on

         20.05.2005 although according to the stamp report limitation had expired

         on 28.02.1996 and hence there is delay of more than nine years in the

         filing of the instant second appeal. In her application for condoning the

         delay bearing I.A. no.2386 of 2009 the plaintiff has sought to lay the

         entire blame for delay upon her advocate and advocate's clerk at Hajipur

         but the same is not substantiated by any valid and convincing ground or

         material and hence there is no merit at all in the said interlocutory

         application either.
</p>
<p id="p_12">                           9. In the aforesaid facts and circumstances this second

         appeal is dismissed, at this stage of hearing under Order XLI Rule 11 of

         the Code of Civil Procedure.
</p>
<p id="p_13">                                                               (S.N.Hussain,J)
