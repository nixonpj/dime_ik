the prosecution :-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">              "That on 18.9.2008, SI Jasbir Singh along with other police
              officials were present at Bus Stand, Dharamgarh, where Jasvir
              Singh complainant got his statement recorded to the effect
              that he is the resident of Jejian Patti, Mehlan and is running a
              shop. They are three brother and sisters. He is the eldest.
              Younger to him is his sister Harjinder Kaur, who is married
              with Gurjit Singh son of Ramdhan Singh, resident of Ugrahan
              and Hardeep Kaur, elder sister was married four years ago
              with Dharminder Singh @ Soni, resident of Rattangarh
              Patiawali, P.S. Sunam, and out of the said wedlock, one son
              has born, who is of the age of 2½ years. At the time of her
              marriage, sufficient dowry articles were given by his mother
              and father to his sister, but Dharminder Singh-husband of her
              sister, Gursewak Singh-brother of Dharminder Singh, Gulab
              Kaur-mother and Baldev Singh-father of Dharminder Singh
              were not happy with the said dowry. They used to taunt her
              sister for bringing less dowry. He being elder brother has
              gone several times to Patiawali and made Dharminder Singh
              and members of his family understand that they have given
              the dowry articles as per their capacity and as and when some
              occasion comes, their demand shall be fulfilled. When the
              son was born about 2½ years ago, in the conventional gifts
              (Shushak), various articles were given to in-laws of her sister,
              as per their demand, but they were not happy and started
              demanding a big car.      They demanded more money and
              threatened that if the demand is not fulfilled, they will re-
              marry Dharminder Singh and will desert her sister.          No

              Panchayat was convened because of shame, but the members
              of in-laws family of her sister were made to understand and
              they did not stop from taunting her sister for bringing less
              dowry.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">              3.        On 18.9.2008, at about 3.00 P.M., he received a
              telephonic call from her sister that Dharminder Singh @ Soni,
              his brother Gursewak Singh and his father Baldev Singh and
              mother Gulab Kaur are raising the demand of a big car and are
              taunting her, either their demand may be fulfilled or she may
              be taken from her in-laws house. He disclosed it to Beant
              Singh son of Mohinder Singh and Balwinder Singh son of
              Ganga Ram and took them to the house of in-laws of her
              sister.      They reached at about 8.00 P.M., at Rattangarh
              Patiawali and found that her sister was hanging with the fan
              by tying 'Dupatta' around her neck.       In their presence,
              Dharminder Singh and his brother Gursewak Singh got the
              dead body of Hardeep Kaur down and put the same on bed.
              She was lying dead. Dharminder Singh, Gursewak Singh,
              Baldev Singh and Gulab Kaur fled away from the spot."</blockquote><p id="p_5">

</p><p id="p_6">              Death is by hanging and within 4 years from the date of

marriage of the deceased with Dharminder Singh alias Soni.

</p><p id="p_7">              The Investigating Officer after recording statement of Jasvir

Singh (PW-1) went to the spot, got clicked photographs of the place of

occurrence and the dead body. He prepared inquest report and sent the

dead body for post mortem examination. Dharminder Singh alias Soni was

arrested on 28.9.2008 by Inspector Kulwant Singh (PW-12).              The

Investigating Officer also recorded statements of the witnesses and on

completing all the legal formalities, submitted the final report in Court.

Copies of the documents were supplied to the respondent-accused as per
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3"> CRM-A No. 805-MA of 2012                                               -4-</span>

norms. Their case was committed to the competent Court for trial vide

order dated 17.2.2009. The accused were charge sheeted to which they

pleaded not guilty and claimed trial.      The prosecution produced 12

witnesses and also brought on record documentary evidence to prove its

case.
</p>
<p id="p_8">              On conclusion of the prosecution's evidence, separate

statements of all the accused were recorded under <a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_4">Section 313</a> Cr.P.C.

Incriminating circumstances appearing against them on record, were put to

them, which they denied, claimed innocence and false implication.

</p><p id="p_9">              Dharminder Singh alias Soni took a specific defence that he

was separate in mess and residence from Gursewak Singh-respondent No.2

and his parents. To prove above fact, the accused produced Ravinder

Singh, Inspector Grade-II as DW-1. It was also so said by Bikkar Singh

(DW-2), Sarpanch of the village.
</p>
<p id="p_10">              The trial Judge on appraisal of evidence found respondent

No.2 not guilty which resulted into his acquittal, whereas Dharminder

Singh alias Soni and Gulab Kaur were convicted for commission of an

offence under <a href="/doc/653797/" id="a_5">Section 304B</a> IPC vide the impugned judgment and they

were sentenced accordingly as found mentioned in earlier part of this

order.
</p>
<p id="p_11">              Counsel for the applicant has vehemently contended that

when granting benefit of acquittal to respondent No.2, the trial Judge has

not appreciated the evidence in a proper manner.

</p><p id="p_12">              After hearing counsel for the applicant and on going through

the paper book, we are not inclined to accept argument raised by counsel
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4"> CRM-A No. 805-MA of 2012                                                 -5-</span>

for the applicant.
</p>
<p id="p_13">              Respondent No.2 is brother-in-law of the deceased. It was

noted by the trial Judge that he was not going to be benefitted by harassing

or pressurizing the deceased to bring more dowry. Sufficient reasons are

given in Para No. 59 of the judgment under challenge, to absolve him of

the criminal liability. It has also come on record that he was separate in

mess and residence from accused Dharminder Singh alias Soni. The

opinion formed by the court below is perfectly justified and as per

evidence on record.

SCC 479', decided on September 5, 2011, the Supreme Court, after

looking into many earlier judgments, has laid down parameters, in which

interference can be made in a judgment of acquittal, by observing as under:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_4">              "An order of acquittal is to be interfered with only when there
              are "compelling and substantial reasons", for doing so. If the
              order is "clearly unreasonable", it is a compelling reason for
              interference. When the trial Court has ignored the evidence or
              misread the material evidence or has ignored material
              documents like dying declaration/report of ballistic experts
              etc., the appellate court is competent to reverse the decision of
              the trial Court depending on the materials placed."</blockquote><p id="p_19">

</p><p id="p_20">              Similarly, in the case of '<a href="/doc/624481245/" id="a_12">State of Rajasthan v. Shera Ram</a>

alias Vishnu Dutta, (2012) 1 SCC 602', the Hon'ble Supreme Court has

observed as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">              "7. A judgment of acquittal has the obvious consequence of
              granting freedom to the accused. This Court has taken a
              consistent view that unless the judgment in appeal is contrary
              to evidence, palpably erroneous or a view which could not
              have been taken by the court of competent jurisdiction
              keeping in view the settled canons of criminal jurisprudence,
              this Court shall be reluctant to interfere with such judgment of
              acquittal.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_6">              8. The penal laws in India are primarily based upon certain
              fundamental procedural values, which are right to fair trial
              and presumption of innocence. A person is presumed to be
              innocent till proven guilty and once held to be not guilty of a
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6"> CRM-A No. 805-MA of 2012                                                    -7-</span>

              criminal charge, he enjoys the benefit of such presumption
              which could be interfered with only for valid and proper
              reasons. An appeal against acquittal has always been
              differentiated from a normal appeal against conviction.
              Wherever there is perversity of facts and/or law appearing in
              the judgment, the appellate court would be within its
              jurisdiction to interfere with the judgment of acquittal, but
              otherwise such interference is not called for."</blockquote><p id="p_21">

</p><p id="p_22">              Thereafter, in the above case a large number of judgments

were discussed and then it was opined as under:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_7">              "10. There is a very thin but a fine distinction between an
              appeal against conviction on the one hand and acquittal on the
              other. The preponderance of judicial opinion of this Court is
              that there is no substantial difference between an appeal
              against conviction and an appeal against acquittal except that
              while dealing with an appeal against acquittal the Court keeps
              in view the position that the presumption of innocence in
              favour of the accused has been fortified by his acquittal and if
              the view adopted by the High Court is a reasonable one and
              the conclusion reached by it had its grounds well set out on
              the materials on record, the acquittal may not be interfered
              with. Thus, this fine distinction has to be kept in mind by the
              Court while exercising its appellate jurisdiction. The golden
              rule is that the Court is obliged and it will not abjure its duty
              to prevent miscarriage of justice, where interference is
              imperative and the ends of justice so require and it is essential
              to appease the judicial conscience."</blockquote><p id="p_23">
