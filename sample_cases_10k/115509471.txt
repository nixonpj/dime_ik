IN THE HIGH COURT OF JUDICATURE FOR RAJASTHAN AT
                      JODHPUR.

                        JUDGMENT


LAXMAN                 VS.            STATE OF RAJASTHAN


          D.B.CRIMINAL JAIL APPEAL No.22/2005
          under <a href="/doc/769517/" id="a_1">Section 383</a> Cr.P.C. against the
          judgment dated 04.12.2004 passed by
          learned Sessions Judge Pratapgarh District

                       PRESENT

         HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE GOVIND MATHUR
     HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE BANWARI LAL SHARMA

Mr.Kalu Ram Amicus Curiae for the appellant;
Mr.KR Bishnoi, Public Prosecutor.


BY THE COURT : [As per Hon'ble Sharma, J.]</pre>


<p id="p_1">          This jail appeal is preferred         to challenge the

judgment of    conviction    and      order of sentence dated

04.12.2004    passed    by    the     learned   Sessions   Judge,

Pratapgarh District Chittorgarh in Sessions Case No.84/2004

(State of Rajasthan Vs. Laxman).          The learned Sessions

Judge by the judgment impugned convicted the accused

appellant for an offence punishable under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_2">Section 302</a> IPC

and sentenced him to undergo life term imprisonment with

a fine of Rs.10,000/-. He is further required to undergo six

months additional imprisonment in the event of default in

payment of fine.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                  2</span><p id="p_2">

</p><p id="p_3">        The factual matrix      necessary to be noticed for

adjudication of this appeal is that on 03.03.2004 at about

11:30 a.m. complainant Laxman S/o Dhulaji Meena (PW 10)

R/o     Shyamli     Pathar   Police   Station   Deogarh,   Distt.

Chittorgarh       has made a verbal complainant before the

Station House Officer, Police Station Deogarh (District

Chittorgarh) Sri Ramniwas (PW 19) that :-

</p><p id="p_4">        "Yesterday i.e. on 02.03.2004 at about 08:00 p.m. his

father Dhulaji S/o Badiya Meena            was taken away by

Laxman S/o Hoorji Meena on the pretext of Panchayat

stating that other Panchas were also there at village

Shyamli Pathar as his brother Bhera is having doubt that he

(accused) is having illicit relations with his wife (Bhera), so

his father went with Laxman S/o Hoorji. Today in morning

at about 9:00 a.m., Shiv Lal S/o Heeraji came to his house

and told that his father is lying dead in Nanki valley. When

he rushed to Nanki valley he saw that dead body of his

father is lying there and his head is separated from rest of

the body. His father was murdered by some sharp edged

weapon and he has doubt that Laxman S/o Hoorji Meena,

R/o Shyamli Pathar has murdered his father by some sharp

edged weapon so legal proceedings may be initiated against

him."
</p>
<p id="p_5">         On the basis        of this information, a case was

registered as FIR No. 25/2004         under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_3">Section 302</a> IPC at

Police Station Deogarh District Chittorgarh and investigation
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                     3</span>

commenced. After completing the investigation, the charge

sheet was filed before the Court of learned Judicial

Magistrate, Ist Class, Pratapgarh on 31.05.2004. Since the

case was exclusively triable by the Court of Sessions,

therefore,        the same was committed to the Court of

Sessions and after affording hearing charge against the

accused appellant for an offence under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_4">Section 302</a> IPC was

framed. On denial of charge trial commenced as desired.

</p><p id="p_6">     The prosecution supported its case with the aid of

witnesses (PW 1 to PW 19) and exhibited                           several

documents and an opportunity was given to appellant

accused      to    explain    the       adverse   and     incriminating

circumstances       appearing      in   prosecution     evidence.    The

accused appellant turned the entire evidence as false with

further assertion that he was innocent and he is implicated

falsely and did not choose to adduce evidence in defence.

</p><p id="p_7">     Learned trial court after examining the entire evidence

available    on    record    and    after   hearing     learned    Public

Prosecutor and learned counsel for the accused appellant

recorded the conviction and awarded the sentence as

aforesaid vide impugned judgment.
</p>
<p id="p_8">      In appeal, the argument advanced by learned Amicus

Curiae is that the court below failed to appreciate that the

circumstances on which conviction                 is based were not

sufficient enough to indicate only one conclusion i.e.

involvement of accused appellant with crime in question. As
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                               4</span>

per learned Amicus Curiae, a reasonable doubt exists in

accepting involvement of the accused appellant in the crime

in question.
</p>
<p id="p_9">     While defending the conviction recorded and sentence

awarded, it is submitted by learned Public Prosecutor Sri

Kalyan Ram Bishnoi that the conviction is based upon the

circumstances of last seen and recovery of weapon of

offence made at the instance of       accused appellant.   The

recovered weapon was having blood stains with the blood

group matching with the blood group of the deceased.

Thus, the circumstances are sufficient to indicate only one

conclusion arrived at by learned trial court.

</p><p id="p_10">     Heard learned Amicus Curiae for the appellant and

learned Public Prosecutor for the State and perused the

record.
</p>
<p id="p_11">     As per the medical evidence available on record, Ex.P-

3 Post Mortem Report of the deceased Dhula his head and

neck were completely separated and the cause of death was

hemorrhage by blood loss      due to complete separation of

Head and Neck by incised wound. There is no doubt about

homicidal death of deceased Dhula the issue requires

consideration is about the definite involvement of the

accused with the crime in question.
</p>
<p id="p_12">     The case of the prosecution is based on circumstantial

evidence relating to last seen of the deceased in the

company of accused and certain recoveries made at his
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                    5</span>

instance.
</p>
<p id="p_13">     In the matter of Sharad Birdi Chand Sharda Vs.

State of Maharashtra (AIR 1984 SC 1622) Hon'ble

Supreme Court while dealing with circumstantial evidence, it

has been held that onus was on the prosecution to prove

that the chain is complete and the infirmity of lacuna in

prosecution cannot be cured by false defence or plea. The

condition precedence in the words of this court before

conviction can be passed on circumstantial evidence, must

be fully established. They are:-
</p>
<p id="p_14">            1]    The      circumstances    from    which      the

                 conclusion of guilt is to be drawn should

                 be fully established. The circumstances

                 concerned "must" or "should"            and not

                 "may be" established;
</p>
<p id="p_15">            2] The facts so established should be

                 consistent only with the hypotheses of

                 the guilt of the accused, there is to say,

                 they should not be explainable on any

                 other hypotheses except that accused is

                 guilty;
</p>
<p id="p_16">            3]    The       circumstances    should      be     of

                 conclusive nature and tendency;
</p>
<p id="p_17">            4] They should exclude every possible

                 hypotheses      except     the    one    to   be

                 proved; and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                               6</span>

           5] There must be a chain of evidence so

           completed has not to leave any reasonable

           ground for the conclusive consistence with

           the innocence of the accused and must so

           that in all human probable the act must

           have been done by the accused.
</p>
<p id="p_18">     PW 10 Laxman S/o Dhulaji complainant, son of

deceased was cited by the prosecution as a witness of last

seen who clearly stated that when his father was murdered

on that day accused Laxman came to his house and took

away his father saying that there is Panchayat in the village

and further told that there is doubt on him that he has illicit

relations with his younger brother's wife, due to it, he called

Panchayat. Thereafter in morning at about 9:00 a.m. Shiv

Lal came to him and informed him that his father is lying

dead in the Nanki valley. This version of this witness was

not challenged in the cross examination. From the       above

statement, it is proved that deceased was taken away from

his house by the accused-appellant in the night on the

fateful day and thereafter on the next morning at about

9:00 a.m. he came      to know that dead body of his father

was lying in the valley.
</p>
<p id="p_19">     PW 1 Shiv Lal also corroborated the statement of PW

10 Laxman that Meera came to him and told that Dhulaba is

lying dead in the Nanki Valley, after that he informed to

Laxman son of Dhulaba accordingly.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                              7</span><p id="p_20">

</p><p id="p_21">     Meera was examined as PW 6 and she corroborated

the statement of PW 1 Shiv Lal that in morning when she

was going with the cattle through Nanki Valley she saw that

Dhulaba was lying dead there and she told this fact to Shiv

Lal who informed at the home of Dhulaba.

</p><p id="p_22">     We do not find any just reason to disbelieve the

testimony of these three witnesses. PW 1 Shiv Lal in quite

unambiguous terms and with all confidence        stated that

deceased Dhulaba was taken away on the pretext of

Panchayat thereafter his dead body was found as such

deceased was last seen with accused appellant.

</p><p id="p_23">     The second circumstance on which the trial court relied

is recovery of weapon of offence. As per learned counsel for

the appellant accused no weapon of offence was recovered

from the accused appellant and the recovery is planted one.

From the perusal of the evidence available on record it

reveals that an information as per <a href="/doc/1312051/" id="a_5">Section 27</a> of the Indian

Evidence Act was provided by the accused appellant. As per

document Ex. P-18 on 11.03.2004 at about 10:00 a.m. a

disclosure was made by the accused about the weapon of

offence acting upon the information given a blood stained

sword   was recovered as per recovery memo Ex. P-12 on

11.03.2004 at 08:35 a.m.         As per FSL Report given by

State Forensic Science Laboratory, Udaipur the blood group

of blood stains available on the sword was of 'O' group

matched with blood group of deceased found on his towel.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                               8</span>

</p><p id="p_24">        The argument advanced by learned Amicus Curiae for

the appellant that the sword i.e. said to be recovered at the

instance of accused appellant, was recovered from the open

place and after 8 days of the incident.
</p>
<p id="p_25">        We have considered this submission from the perusal

of Ex.P-12 recovery Memo and statements of recovery

witnesses Bhanu Prakash PW 11 and         Hoomji PW 12     it

reveals that sword was recovered from under the stones

between the brushes which was in hidden position and was

not visible by anyone. When an article is recovered from a

hidden place on instance of accused then it can be

presumed that it was in conscious possession of the accused

and it was only in his knowledge that where the article was

kept.
</p>
<p id="p_26">        PW 2 Gautam saw the accused appellant with sword

while going towards Rampura having a towel on his

shoulder. He has further stated that before the incident

accused Laxman was used to wander here         &amp; there with

sword and used to say that he will cut someone.

</p><p id="p_27">        Bhera PW 3 brother of accused appellant stated that

accused Laxman murdered his wife 15-16 years for which

he remained in jail and when he took away Dhula with him

on the pretext of Panchayat there was no Panchayat in the

Village and everyone in village was saying that Laxman

murdered Dhulaba.
</p>
<p id="p_28">        Lalu PW 7 has also stated that accused appellant
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                               9</span>

Laxman came to his agricultural field having sword wrapped

in a cloth.
</p>
<p id="p_29">     Amra PW 8 has also stated that Laxman came to him

in his hut which was situated at his agricultural field    and

told him that he will murder someone.
</p>
<p id="p_30">       As per statement of PW 11 Bhanu Pratap and

investigating officer PW 19 Ramniwas accused appellant

identified the place of occurrence also.

</p><p id="p_31">     PW 13 Vaniya has also stated that accused Laxman

took away Dhulaba on the pretext of Panchayat while there

was no Panchayat.
</p>
<p id="p_32">     Ramniwas Investigating Officer PW 19 proved the

information submitted by the accused under Section 27 of

the Indian Evidence Act Ex.P-18 and recovery memo of

sword Ex.P-12.
</p>
<p id="p_33">     The circumstances in the present case are that prior to

the incident, the accused was seen by Gautam PW 2, Bhera

PW 3, Lalu PW 7, Amra PW 8 having sword in his hand and

wandering here and there saying that he will cut someone.

</p><p id="p_34">     On 02.03.2004 at 8:00 p.m. accused appellant took

away deceased Dhula with him with a request to participate

in the Panchayat called by him in the village in regard to the

fact that false allegations are being levelled against him that

he is having illicit relations with the wife of his younger

brother, though no such Panchayat was called for.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                    10</span>

</p><p id="p_35">       On the next day i.e. on 03.03.2004, the dead body of

deceased Dhula was found in the Nanki valley and the head

was separated from the body at the instance of accused

appellant a blood stained sword was recovered and the

same    was   sent   for     examination   to   Forensic   Science

Laboratory, Udaipur.       As per the FSL report Ex.P-14 the

blood group found on the sword was of group 'O' which

matched with the blood group of deceased Dhula. The place

of incident was also identified by the accused appellant and

the sword was recovered at the instance of accused

appellant from     about 15 mtrs. away          from the place of

occurrence i.e. in the brushes under the stones. This forms

an   unbreakable     chain    of   circumstance   which    indicate

towards only one conclusion i.e. the involvement of accused

with the crime in question. No wrong thus is committed by

the trial court while recording the conviction and awarding

the sentence.
</p>
<p id="p_36">       For the reasons given above, we affirm the conviction

recorded and the sentence awarded by the trial court.          The

appeal is dismissed.
