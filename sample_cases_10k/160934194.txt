                 Hon'ble Shri Justice Ram Prasanna Sharma

                              CAV JUDGMENT

</p><p id="p_4">1.    This first appeal is preferred under Section 96 of the Code of Civil

      Procedure, 1908 against judgment/ decree dated 06.08.2011 passed

      by District Judge, Raigarh, District- Raigarh (C.G.) in Civil Suit No. 26-

      A/2011, wherein the said court decreed the suit filed by the

      respondent/ plaintiff for declaration, possession and compensation

      regarding land situated at Nazul Sheet No. 33, Plot No. 83/1, area

      admeasuring 400 sq.ft. at Raigarh which is mentioned in Schedule-A

      of the plaint.
</p>
<p id="p_5">2.    As per the appellants, the respondent filed a suit against the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                                                      Page 2 of 4</span>

     appellants that the property in question is recorded in the joint name

     of Goverdhan Das and Sitaram and the property came into name of

     Goverdhan Das in partition held in the year 1992-93, thereafter, it was

     transferred in name of the respondent as successor. The property was

     being used by the appellants/ defendants and earlier, it was used by

     the appellant's father namely Radhe Shyam Bondia for godown

     purpose with the license of Goverdhan Das. When the appellants

     were asked to vacate the property, they refused and claimed title over

     the suit property i.e. why the suit was filed which was decreed

     contrary to the fact and legal aspect of the matter.

</p><p id="p_6">3.   Learned counsel for the appellants submits as under:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">     (i)     The suit property was sold by grand-father of the respondent to

     grand-father of the appellants and since then they are in peaceful

     possession of the property.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">     (ii)    The appellants and their ancestral are in possession of the

     property for last 60-70 years and they acquired the property by way of

     adverse possession.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">     (iii)   The suit property was never licensed to the appellants and it

     was sold for a cash consideration of Rs. 11,000/-.

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">     (iv)    Awarding compensation against the appellant @ Rs. 100/- per

     day from the date of filing of the suit is without evidence because it is

     not proved that the said property was yielding any income, therefore,

     the finding arrived at by the trial court is not liable to be sustained.

</blockquote><p id="p_7">4.   First question for consideration before this Court is whether the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                                                    Page 3 of 4</span>

     respondent/ plaintiff is owner of the property in question or the

     appellants/ defendants are owner of the property in question. The

     respondent/ plaintiff side adduced evidence of Prahlad Roy (PW-1)

     and Jashpal Singh (PW-2) while the appellants side adduced

     evidence of Sanjay Bondia (DW-2). As per version of respondent

     witness, the property in question is property of Prahlad Roy. Version of

     this witness is supported by Maintenance Khasra (Ex.P/4) and

     document of lease (Ex.P/5). As against this, no document was filed on

     behalf of the appellants. They are basing their claim on oral

     transaction of sale and possession. The appellants side stating that

     they purchased the land from ancestral of the respondent for a cash

     consideration of Rs. 11,000/-, but no document was produced before

     the trial court to support their claim.
</p>
<p id="p_8">5.   The immovable property valued more than Rs. 100/- can be alienated

     only by way of registered sale-deed as per provisions of <a href="/doc/613871/" id="a_1">Section 54</a> of

     the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 and Section 17 of the Indian

     Registration Act, 1908, therefore, it is legally not sound to say that the

     property was purchased through oral transaction. From version of the

     appellants, it is clear that their possession is permissive possession.

     When the possession is permissive possession, it cannot be

     converted into adverse possession. For adverse possession, it has to

     be established that the person claiming such possession entered into

     property without having any right and challenged the right against

     owner.
</p>
<p id="p_9">6.   In the present case, the appellants are claiming right on the basis of

     oral transaction which cannot be termed as adverse to right of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                                                           Page 4 of 4</span>

            respondent, therefore, argument advanced on behalf of the appellants

            on this count is not sustainable.
</p>
<p id="p_10">       7.   Sanjay Bondia (DW-2) entered into witness box on behalf of the

            appellants and deposed before the trial court that the property in

            question is used for business purpose. He also deposed that the

            property in question is valued to Rs. 12 lakh. Looking to the statement

            of this witness, it cannot be said that the compensation to the tune of

            Rs. 100/- per day awarded by the trial curt is excessive or

            unreasonable, therefore, the compensation part as awarded by the

            trial court is also not liable to be interfered with and this Court has no

            reason to record contrary finding.
</p>
<p id="p_11">       8.   Accordingly, the appeal is liable to be dismissed. The decree is

            passed against the appellants and in favour of the respondent on the

            following terms and conditions:-
</p>
<pre id="pre_2">            (i)     The appeal is dismissed with cost.

            (ii)    The appellants to bear cost of the respondent throughout.

</pre><p id="p_12">            (iii)   Pleaders' fee, if certified be calculated as per certificate or as

                    per schedule whichever is less.
</p>
<pre id="pre_3">            (iv)    A decree be drawn accordingly.

                                                                  Sd/-
                                                         (Ram Prasanna Sharma)
                                                                 Judge
