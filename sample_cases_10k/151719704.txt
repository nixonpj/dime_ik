!For petitioner : Mr. S.M.Mohan Gandhi  

^For R1         : Mr.D.Sivaraman         
                        
        For R2          : Labour Court


:ORDER  
</pre>
<p id="p_1">        Heard the learned counsel on either side.
</p>
<p id="p_2">        2. The petitioner is employed as a Conductor in the respondent
Corporation.  He was issued with a charge memo on the ground that he 
committed misappropriation, in the matter of issuance of tickets.  He was
dismissed from service in the year 2003.  The petitioner filed I.D.No.97 of
2005 before the Labour Court, Madurai.  The Labour Court, by the impugned
order dated 13.09.2011, directed the petitioner's reinstatement, with
continuity of service.  However back wages was denied.  The reasons for the
denial was that the employee did not Co-operate for the speedy disposal of
I.D.No.97 of 2005. The Labour Court, in fact, invoked its powers under
Section 11 A of the Industrial Dispute Act and modified the order of
punishment. 
</p>        
<p id="p_3">        3. The management filed W.P.(MD)No.1483 of 2015 before this Court. 
This Court dismissed the writ petition on 18.08.2015 observing that the
approach of the labour Court is reasonable.  Though the said order was passed
at the stage of admission without notice to the workman, this Court can
certainly looked into the said order.  It is relevant to mention here that
out of two charges framed, the Labour Court came to the conclusion that one
charge was made out.  That is a finding of fact.  This Court sitting in writ
jurisdiction cannot interfere with such a finding of fact.
</p>
<p id="p_4">        4. The labour Court after finding that one charge framed against the
writ petitioner is proved and modified the order of punishment of dismissal
and denied backwages in view of the conduct of the workman in conducting the
litigation. This Court is of the view that no ground is made out for
interference.  It is relevant to note here that the labour Court passed the
order as early as on 13.09.2011.  The writ petition came to be filed after a
gap of a full five years.  On the face of it, it is hit by laches. There is
no ground made out. 
</p>        
<p id="p_5">        5. Accordingly, this writ petition stands dismissed. No Costs.
Consequently, connected miscellaneous petition is closed.
</p>
