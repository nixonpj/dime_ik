                                       ORAL ORDER</pre>

<p id="p_1">8   01-08-2019                    A supplementary counter affidavit is being filed on

                   behalf of State respondents, which is being taken on record.

</p><p id="p_2">                                This writ application has been filed seeking quashing

                   of an order, dated 22.02.2016, passed by the Deputy Collector

                   Land Reforms, Barh, in Case No. 1 of 2015-16, whereby he has

                   apparently reviewed his own order, earlier passed in the same

                   case on 11.12.2015 on the basis of a request made by the Land

                   Acquisition Officer, Patna. The order, dated 11.12.2015, and the

                   impugned order, dated 22.02.2016, have been brought on record

                   by way of Annexures-12 and 14 respectively. On perusal of the
 Patna High Court CWJC No.8737 of 2018(8) dt.01-08-2019
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                              2/6</span>




          subsequent order, dated 22.02.2016, it is easily evincible that it

          has been passed pursuant to a request made to him by the Land

          Acquisition Officer, Patna, through his letter dated 03.02.2016.

</p><p id="p_3">                      As the Court was clueless, as to what kind of request

          was made by the Land Acquisition Officer, Patna, which had

          compelled the Deputy Collector Land Reforms, Barh, to review

          his own order, the Court had requested the learned counsel

          representing the State to produce the original records of the said

          case. The records have accordingly been produced. At page 50

          of the original records, the said letter No.329 dated 03.02.2016,

          written by the Land Acquisition Officer, Patna, addressed to the

          Deputy Collector Land Reforms, Barh, Patna, is available.

          Following are the contents of the said letter :

</p><p id="p_5">                      On the same day, i.e., 03.02.2016, the Deputy

          Collector Land Reforms, Barh, issued a notice to the petitioner

          for rehearing of the case as, according to him, the land in

          question was Government land and not a raiyati land of the

          petitioner as held by him earlier in his order dated 11.12.2015.

          The pace, with which the Deputy Collector Land Reforms

          moved, is evident from the records, after he received the letter

          from the Land Acquisition Officer, Patna. Through notice issued

          on the same day, i.e., 03.02.2015, the petitioner was asked to

          appear before him along with all relevant records on

          05.02.2016. The notice was got served on the petitioner on

          04.02.2016. On 08.02.2016, the Deputy Collector Land Reforms

          sought legal opinion from the Government Pleader. Learned

          Government Pleader, who received the request for giving his

          legal opinion, sent his legal opinion on 10.02.2016. After having

          received the legal opinion, the Deputy Collector Land Reforms,
 Patna High Court CWJC No.8737 of 2018(8) dt.01-08-2019
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                            4/6</span>




          blaming the Circle Officer of having furnished wrong

          information, leading to passing of the order dated 11.12.2015,

          passed the impugned order dated 22.02.2016.

</p><p id="p_6">                      The description of land, in question, has been given in

          paragraph 4 of the application, admeasuring 32 decimal of S.P.

          No. 1146, Khata No.263, situate at Village-Madhopur Mahal in

          the district of Patna. The said land has been used for

          construction of NH-31. Amount of compensation was

          determined to be paid to the petitioner. In the meanwhile, before

          the amount could be paid, the developments, as noted above,

          took place and by subsequent order dated 22.02.2016, the

          Deputy Collector Land Reforms has held the said land to be

          Government land.
</p>
<p id="p_7">                      I have heard Mr. Surendra Kumar, learned counsel

          appearing on behalf of the petitioner and Mr. Akhilesh Kumar

          Sinha, learned A.C. to S.C.-19.
</p>
<p id="p_8">                      On perusal of the impugned order dated 22.02.2016,

          which has apparently been passed by the same Officer, who had

          passed the earlier order dated 11.12.2015, it is evident that the

          Deputy Collector Land Reforms has not at all applied his mind

          and has based his decision on the legal opinion of learned

          Government Pleader, Barh, and the report of the Circle Officer.
 Patna High Court CWJC No.8737 of 2018(8) dt.01-08-2019
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                            5/6</span>




          The impugned order is, on the face of it,           cryptic and

          unreasoned, which discloses no application of mind at all.

          Secondly, there is yet other question, which has emerged

          whether the Deputy Collector Land Reforms had any power of

          review of his own order dated 11.12.2015. It is not evident as to

          in exercise of which jurisdiction, the Deputy Collector Land

          Reforms had passed the order, dated 11.12.2015.

</p><p id="p_9">                      Mr. Akhilesh Kumar Sinha, learned A.C. to S.C.-19

          has relied on certain provisions under the Bihar Land Disputes

          Resolution Act, 2009, under which, according to him, the order

          was passed. The Act does not stipulate any provision for review.

          There is provision under Section 14 of the Act under which any

          party, aggrieved by the order passed by the competent authority,

          may prefer an appeal before the Commissioner, within whose

          jurisdiction the order has been passed.
</p>
<p id="p_10">                      As a matter of fact, there was no application made

          even for review before the Deputy Collector Land Reforms and

          he appears to have acted on the dictation of the Land

          Acquisition Officer, Patna, for reviewing his own order dated

          11.12.2015.
</p>
<p id="p_11">                      The order dated 22.02.2016, in my view, is

          unsustainable and beyond jurisdiction. As has already been
           Patna High Court CWJC No.8737 of 2018(8) dt.01-08-2019
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                                      6/6</span>




                    noted, since the order is non-speaking and unreasoned, the

                    impugned order cannot be allowed to sustain. Accordingly, the

                    order, dated 22.02.2016, passed by the Deputy Collector Land

                    Reforms, Barh, is quashed.
</p>
<p id="p_12">                                This application is accordingly allowed.
</p>
<p id="p_13">                                It will, however, be open to the respondents to

                    question the correctness of the order, dated 11.12.2015, of the

                    Deputy Collector Land Reforms, Barh, in accordance with law

                    before the competent authority.
</p>
<p id="p_14">                                The original records is being returned to learned A.C.

                    to S.C.-19.
