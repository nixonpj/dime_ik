                 C.O.(C). No. 1947 of 2012

         Dated this the 8th day of January, 2013

                           JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">      This  is  a   petition filed  by   the  petitioner   alleging

contumacious act on the part of the respondent in passing

Annexure VI order dated 7.12.2012, reverting the petitioner from

the post of Junior Superintendent, in spite of the specific interim

order passed by this Court vide Annexure IV dated 31.10.2012.

</p><p id="p_2">      2. The learned counsel for the respondent submits that the

issue pending in the writ petition was with reference to the

seniority position assigned, which was sought to be unsettled

quite after several years, under which circumstance, the interim

order of stay came to be passed. As per Annexure VI reversion of

the petitioner has been ordered for a different reason, pursuant

to joining back by the persons went on deputation concerned and

as such, it is never in violation of interim order passed by this

Court.
</p>
<p id="p_3">      3. It is further brought to the notice of this Court by the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">C.O.C. No. 1947 of 2012          -2-</span>


learned Senior Counsel appearing for the petitioner that, the

petitioner had to move the Court for further positive orders and

after considering the merits involved, the petitioner was directed

to be placed as before i.e., as Junior Superintendent and after

considering the same, a positive order was passed, pursuant to

which, the respondents have given effect to the same and that

the petitioner is continuing as Junior Superintendent, as on date.

</p><p id="p_4">      After hearing both the sides, this Court finds that the

grievance of the petitioner stands substantially redressed and this

Court does not find it necessary to proceed with any further step.

The Contempt case (Civil) is closed accordingly.
