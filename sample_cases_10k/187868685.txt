    (DR. SHAILENDRA KUMAR SHRIVASTAVA Vs THE STATE OF MADHYA PRADESH)


30-09-2015

Mr.L.C.Patne, learned counsel for the petitioner.
Mr.Girish Kekre, learned Government Advocate for respondents-
                   State.
In this writ petition the petitioner inter alia has challenged the
                   validity of order dated 21/09/2015 by which the
                   representation submitted by the petitioner in
                   pursuance of order passed by this Court against
                   the order of transfer has been rejected. It is
                   also pertinent to mention here that the
                   petitioner has also challenged the validity of
                   order dated 15/06/2015 by which the petitioner
                   has been transferred from Jabalpur to
                   Hoshangabad.
Facts</pre><p id="p_1"> giving rise to filing of the writ petition briefly stated are
                   that the petitioner who is Class-I Officer and is
                   posted as Assistant Professor (Physics) in
                   Government Science College, Jabalpur was
                   transferred from Jabalpur to Hoshangabad by
                   an order dated 15/06/2015. The order of
                   transfer was challenged by the petitioner in
                   W.P.No.9414/2015 which was disposed of by a
                   Bench of this Court by an order dated
                   01/07/2015 with the direction to the
                   respondents to decide the representation
                   submitted by the petitioner and till the decision
                   on the representation of the petitioner he was
                  permitted to continue on the post in question.
                  Thereafter, by an order dated 21/09/2015, the
                  Commissioner Higher Education has rejected
                  the representation submitted by the petitioner.
Learned counsel for the petitioner while inviting the attention of
                  this Court to Clause 14 of the policy of transfer
                  has submitted that the petitioner is Class-I
                  employee and therefore the competent
                  authority to decide the representation
                  submitted by the petitioner was the Chief
                  Secretary and the representation submitted by
                  the petitioner has not been decided by Chief
                  Secretary.
</p><p id="p_2">On the other hand, learned Government Advocate has opposed
                  the prayer and has submitted that the ground
                  urged by the petitioner is hyper technical in
                  nature and on such ground order of transfer
                  should not be quashed. It is further submitted
                  that the petitioner is posted in Jabalpur since
                  2000.
</p><p id="p_3">I have considered the submissions made by learned counsel for
                  parties. From perusal of order dated
                  01/07/2015 passed by a Bench of this Court, it
                  is evident that the Court has not specified the
                  authority which has to consider and decide the
                  representation submitted by the petitioner.
                  Clause 14 of the policy of transfer provides that
                    if representation is submitted by Class-I officer
                   the same has to be considered by the Chief
                   Secretary. Thus, it is evident that the
                   representation submitted by the petitioner has
                   not been considered by the competent authority
                   as per the policy of transfer. The impugned
                   order therefore 21/09/2015 is quashed. The
                   competent authority, namely Chief Secretary is
                   directed to decide the representation submitted
                   by the petitioner by a speaking order within a
                   period of four months from the date of receipt
                   of certified copy of the order passed today. Till
                   the representation submitted by the petitioner
                   is decided he shall be allowed to continue at his
                   present place of posting.
</p><p id="p_4">Accordingly, the Writ Petition is disposed of.
Certified copy as per rules.
