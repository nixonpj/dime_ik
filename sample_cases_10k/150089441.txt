                   SUIT FOR RECOVERY

JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">1.      By this judgment I shall dispose the present suit for recovery

     filed by the plaintiff bank against the defendant.

</p><p id="p_2">2.      Brief facts relevant for adjudication of the present suit are as
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                    2</span>

     follows :-
</p>
<p id="p_3">3.      The plaintiff bank filed the present suit for recovery of Rs.

</p><p id="p_4">     92,355/- through its manager Sh. B. S. Rama Prasad against

     the defendant.
</p>
<p id="p_5">4.          The defendant had approached to the plaintiff bank for

     loan under Prime Minister's Rozgar Yojana for educated

     unemployed in the month of March 2005 which was duly

     considered by the plaintiff and after execution of necessary

     documents a composite term loan of Rs. 68,400/- was sanctioned

     to the defendant. The said amount was agreed to be repaid

     with interest @ 10 % per annum in 60 monthly installments of

     Rs. 1,530/- each.
</p>
<p id="p_6">5.      After sanctioning the loan the defendant fails to adhere to

     the financial discipline and become irregular in the repayment

     of monthly installments as per the agreed terms and conditions.

</p><p id="p_7">6.         Despite repeated requests and reminders when the

     defendants failed to make the outstanding payment the plaintiff
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                       3</span>

     served a legal demand notice dated 27.7.2007 calling upon the

     defendant to clear the loan amount.         The defendant neither

     complied nor replied the said demand notice and therefore,

     plaintiff filed the present suit for recovery.

</p><p id="p_8">7. In pursuance to the service of the summons of the present suit

     defendant put his appearance and shown his willingness to

     compromise the present matter.        At joint request of both the

     parties the matter was referred to Mediation Center wherein a

     compromise was arrived at between the parties and matter was

     referred back to the court for compliance of the compromise as

     per the terms and conditions settled in the Mediation Center.

     Thereafter, neither the defendant abide by the terms of the

     settlement nor appeared before the court to contest the present

     case and accordingly was proceeded ex-parte vide order dated

     9.03.2009.
</p>
<p id="p_9">8.      In order to prove his case plaintiff led exparte evidence and

     examined one witness namely Sh. Ajay Kumar Singh as PW1
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                      4</span>

     who tendered his affidavit as Ex. PW 1/A and identified the

     following documents:-
</p>
<p id="p_10">     i) Certified copy of gazette notification as Ex. PW 1/1.

</p><p id="p_11">     ii) Loan documents as Ex. PW 1/2 to Ex. PW 1/5

</p><p id="p_12">     iii) Legal demand notice dated 27.7.2007 alongwith A/D Card as

     Ex. PW 1/6 and PW1/7 respectively.
</p>
<p id="p_13">     iv) Statement of the loan account as Ex PW 1/8.

</p><p id="p_14">9.      Arguments on behalf of plaintiff heard. Record perused.

</p><p id="p_15">10.     The whole testimony of PW1 has gone unrebutted and

     uncontested as defendant has chosen not to contest the present

     suit and was proceeded exparte vide order dated 9.03.2009. I

     find no reason to disbelieve the unassailed sworn testimony of

     PW 1 coupled with supporting documents. Suit is filed within

     limitation.   Hence I am of the firm view that plaintiff has

     successfully proved his case by preponderance of the probability.

</p><p id="p_16">11.     In the light of above mentioned discussion, the suit is liable

     to be   decreed    in favour of the plaintiff and against the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                  5</span>

  defendant for a sum of Rs. 92,355/-.      The plaintiff has also

  prayed for pendente lite and future interest @ 18% per annum.

  However the agreed rate of interest between the parties was

  10% per annum. Therefore I am of the firm view that pendente

  lite interest @ 10% per annum and future interest at the rate of

  6 % per annum will serve the ends of justice.

</p><p id="p_17">12.   Hence the suit is decreed in favour of the plaintiff and

  against the defendant for the sum of Rs. 92,355/- along with

  pendente lite interest @ 10% per annum and future interest @

  6% per annum. Cost of litigation is also awarded. Decree Sheet

  be prepared accordingly. File be consigned to record room after

  necessary compliance.
