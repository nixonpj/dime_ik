 Facts in brief:

</pre><p id="p_8"> 4.             The prosecution case is in a very narrow compass.  The

 FIR   is   lodged   by   Smt.   Rekhabai   Sangele   (PW2).     It   is   dated

 05.04.2005.  The oral report is at Exh.-27.  The gist of the FIR is

 that her son Yogesh; the deceased, used to work with one cable

 operator as daily wager.  On 04.04.2005, he came from his work

 at 5 O'clock.   That time, it was revealed to him that one of his

 relatives Ankur is in Sakkardara police station's lock up and his

 two   wheeler   is   also  detained  there.    Therefore,   he   went   to   the

 Sakkardara   police   station   and   brought   his   two   wheeler   Hero

 Honda motorcycle and he was plying the said vehicle.  That time,

 both the accused persons also were in his company.  At about 9.15

 p.m., as per the prosecution, some altercations took place between

 these   three   persons   in   which   Yogesh   was   assaulted   by   accused

 persons   by   fist   blows   and   he   was   lying   on   the   spot;   was   the

 information   that   was   transmitted   to   the   first   informant   by   one

 Rajkumar.    On   getting  the  said  information,  the  first  informant

 reached   to   the   spot.     She   noticed  her   son   Yogesh   was   lying   in

 unconscious   condition   and   accused   no.2-Anwar   was   standing

 there.     The   FIR   itself   shows   that   one   Ajay   Nafre   (PW4)   and

 accused Anwar with the help of one Omprakash Betiwar (PW3)

 took Yogesh firstly to one Chandsi Hospital and from there he was

 taken to the Medical College where he was declared dead.  Crime

 was registered on the basis of this report lodged by Smt. Rekha

 (PW2) with Police Station, Sakkardara vide Crime No.259/2005

 for an offence punishable under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_2">Section 302</a> read with <a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_3">Section 34</a>

 of the Indian Penal Code against both the accused persons.   The

 investigation   of   this   crime   was   handed   over   to   PI   Sejul   by   PSI

 Omprakash   Thakur   who   had   registered   the   offence.   After

 completion of the investigation, the charge-sheet was filed in the

 Court   of   law.     The   offence   since   was   exclusively   triable   by   the

 Court of Sessions, the committal order was passed and the case

 has   landed   in   the   Court   of   Sessions   and   it   was   registered   as

 Sessions Trial No.304/2005.

 Nagpur,   below   Exh.-17   framed   the   charge   against   the   accused

 <a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_5">Section 34</a> of the Indian Penal Code.   Both the accused abjured

 their guilt and claimed that they be tried.
</p>
<p id="p_11">                In order to bring home the guilt of the accused persons,

 the   prosecution   has   examined   in   all   seven   witnesses   and   also

 relied on various documents which were duly proved during the

 course of trial.
</p>
<p id="p_12">                After   a   full   dress   trial   and   after   appreciating   the

 prosecution case, the learned Judge of the Court below acquitted

 both the accused of the offence punishable under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_6">Section 302</a> of

 the IPC however convicted them for the offence punishable under

 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_7">Section 304-II</a> of the IPC as observed in the opening paragraph of

 this judgment.  Hence, this appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_13">

 Arguments:
</p>
<p id="p_14"> 6.             Mr. Gupta, learned Senior Advocate for the appellant,

 strenuously   urged   before   me   that   the   case   of   the   prosecution

 cannot   sustain   in   the   eye   of   law   on   the   basis   of   the   available

 evidence   on   record.     He   sharply   attacked   the   prosecution   case

 right from its inception inasmuch as it is his submission that the

 FIR (Exh.-27) cannot be termed as an FIR.  He submitted that the

 from the evidence of Rekha (PW2) it is clear that, before the first

 information was recorded by police  authorities, Rekha  gave her

 oral report at police booth situated at Medical College and the said

 is not brought on record.   Therefore, the Court should draw an

 adverse inference against the prosecution.  He submits that since .




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">::: Uploaded on - 13/04/2018                            ::: Downloaded on - 15/04/2018 01:22:12 :::</span>

 Rekha   (PW2)   has   already   reported   the   matter   to   the   police

 authorities, subsequent statement of Rekha cannot be termed as

 an FIR and at the most it could be her statement.

</p><p id="p_16">                He also pointed out that the medical evidence in the

 case is not reliable inasmuch as according to him, the doctor who

 has conducted the post mortem is ready to make any statements

 which   are   improbable   and   is   contrary   to   the   record.     He   also

 attacked the testimony of two prosecution witnesses Omprakash

 (PW3)  and  Ajay   (PW4)    who  were   examined  as   eye   witnesses.

 According to him, these persons cannot be termed as eye witnesses

 if the evidence of Sharda (PW1) is scrutinized minutely and she

 being   the   prosecution   witness,   her   evidence   is   binding   on   the

 prosecution.  
</p>
<p id="p_17">                In that behalf, Mr. Gupta, the learned Senior Counsel,

 relied on decision of the Hon'ble Apex Court in  Mukhtiar Ahmed

 Ansari Vs. State (NCT of Delhi) reported in  ( 2005) 5 SCC 258, and

 Raja Ram Vs. State of Rajasthan, reported in (  2005) 5 SCC 258.



</p><p id="p_18"> 7.             Mr.   Gupta,   learned   Senior   Counsel   for   the   appellant

 also submitted that the Courts are never bound by the testimony

 of the doctors.  According to him, the evidence of the Doctor itself

 Panabhai Shah Vs. State of Gujarat;  reported in  1982 (2) SCC

 396,  and   also  Tomaso   Brunao   and   anr.   Vs.   State   of   Uttar

 Pradesh;  reported   in  2015   (7)   SCC   178,  to   attack   on   the

 testimony of Dr. Makarand Vyavhare (PW6).
</p>
<p id="p_19">                Mr. Daga, learned counsel for the appellant also made

 the submissions on the line of submissions of Mr. Gupta, learned

 Senior Counsel for the appellant.

 respondent-State would submit that the Court below has correctly

 placed reliance on the testimony of Omprakash (PW3) and Ajay

 (PW4) who are the witnesses of assault by fist and kick blows on

 the   deceased   Yogesh.     He   submitted   that   the   evidence   of   the

 doctor   clearly   shows   that   the   injuries   suffered   by   Yogesh   are

 outcome fist blows and kick blows.   He therefore submitted that

 the appeal be dismissed.

 Evaluation of complaint/FIR in the light of evidence:

</p><p id="p_23"> 9.             First of all, I would like to examine as to whether Exh.-

 27 can be termed as an FIR.

                As per Exh.-27, Rekha (PW2) mother of the deceased

 arrived   on   the   spot,   after   she   received   information   from   one

 Rajkumar.     This   Rajkumar   is   not   examined   by   the   prosecution.

 During trial, through  the   evidence,  it  is  brought on  record that

 Rekha and her daughter were called after arrival of Sharda and

 Ajay on the spot and after sprinkling of the water on Yogesh in an

 attempt to regain his consciousness.
</p>
<p id="p_26">

</p><p id="p_27"> 10.            As per the evidence of Sharda (PW1), Yogesh was lying

 in front of her house.  Her evidence shows that Omprakash (PW3)

 came to her house at 9.30 p.m. and demanded water.  She asked

 as to for what purpose he is demanding water.  Thereupon it was

 revealed by him to her that Yogesh was lying in an unconscious

 state on the road and therefore he wanted water to administer the

 same.  It was given to him.  Thereafter, she followed and went to

 the place where Yogesh was lying.   Ajay (PW4)   sprinkled water

 on the face of Yogesh. Yet he did not regain consciousness and

 therefore the members of the family of Yogesh were called and on

 that mother and sister of Yogesh arrived at the spot.   Thereafter

 Yogesh was shifted to the hospital.

</p><p id="p_30"> 11.            Evidence   of   Rekha   (PW2),   mother   of   the   deceased,

 shows that when she reached to the spot, she noticed Yogesh was

 lying on the ground and both the accused were standing nearby.

 According to her evidence, accused Anwar claimed that he beat

 Yogesh and she can do whatever she wants.  As per her evidence,

 Anwar   and   Ajay   with   the   help   of   Omprakash   took   Yogesh   to

 Chandsi hospital.  There it was advised that he should be shifted

 to the Government Medical College.  Therefore, Yogesh was taken

 to the said hospital where the doctors declared Yogesh to be dead.

 What  is   important   is  that  in  the  evidence  she   claimed  that   she

 submitted the report of the incident at the Medical College and

 Hospital's booth.   Her evidence is very clear in that behalf.   She

 does not state that only an information was given about the death

 of   Yogesh   at   police   booth.     She   asserts   that   she   reported   the

 incident   at  Medical  College  Police   booth.     In  my  view,  there   is

 remarkable difference in giving an intimation about the death and

 reporting the incident to the police.   Giving intimation to police

 about death may be cryptic one.  However, reporting the incident

 always have some details.   It was the duty of the prosecution to

 place on record what was the incident that was reported.   Even

 when   the   intimation   about   the   death   is   given   which   does   not

 Under such situation, the police authorities are under the bounden

 duty to record accidental death under <a href="/doc/411677/" id="a_9">Section 174</a> of the Code of

 Criminal Procedure and the police are required to inquire about

 the said unnatural death.  During inquiry, it is quite possible that

 the   inquiry   officer   may   collect   some   other   information   or   may

 receive   any   other   report   disclosing   commission   of   cognizable

 offence and on that he could register the offence punishable under

 the relevant provisions of the <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_10">IPC</a>.   What is important is that the

 prosecuting agency should not withhold any information and/or

 any report that is submitted to it.  How it should be appreciated is

 the duty of the Court.  An investigating officer is not expected to

 take side of either complainant or the accused person.  He has to

 conduct the investigation impartially and shall produce the entire

 evidence   collected   during   the   course   of   investigation/inquiry

 before   the   Court   so   that   the   Court   can   pass   the   verdict   in

 accordance with law, after appreciating the prosecution case.

                In the light of the principles laid down by the Hon'ble

 Apex Court in Mayur's case supra, and in view of the locations of

 the external injuries noted in the post mortem report (Exh.-50), I

 am   not   in   agreement   with   the   opinion   of   the   doctor   that;   the

 that as the deceased was under the influence of liquor he met with

 a vehicular accident and suffered injuries, those were denied by

 them.  As noted above, it is not the prosecution case that any type

 of weapon; hard, blunt or sharp; was used by the accused persons.

 The nature of external and internal injuries, in my view, does not

 suggest that those can be caused by fist blows.   On the contrary,

 those are suggestive of the person coming in contact with hard

 and rough object.  In that behalf, Sharda (PW1) in front of whose

 house Yogesh was lying, has stated that there were stones lying on

 the spot where Yogesh was found and the road was not having any

 cement or tar layer.   Thus, the place where Yogesh was lying is

 undoubtedly rough and hard place.   In that view of the matter,

 though the Doctor has denied that the injuries cannot be suffered

 due to the fall on such stony surface, I am afraid that his evidence

 in   that   behalf   can   be   accepted.     It   is   to   be   noted   that   all   the

 prosecution witnesses are saying that the two wheeler vehicle was

 lying   beside   the   body   of   Yogesh.     This   fact   also   supports   my

 reasoning   regarding   the   possibility   of   vehicular   accident.     It   is

 quote   possible   that   on   the   fateful   day   when   the   deceased   was

 under the influence of liquor and was plying the vehicle, might

 lost his control for one reason or the other and in addition to that

 it is brought on record that there was dark in the area and having

 no source of light. Thus possibility of the vehicular accident is not

 completely ruled out.

 throw   their   evidence   straightway.     Their   evidence   has   to   be

 evaluated   carefully.    Evidence   of  Omprakash   (PW3)  shows  that

 when he and Ajay (PW4) were proceeding from his house, they

 have heard noise of quarrel. Therefore, they went near the said

 quarrel   and   it   was   between   the   accused   persons   and   Yogesh.

 According to the evidence of Omprakash, they were beating each

 other.     They  were   separated.     Except   this,   nothing  is   stated  by

 Omprakash.     Ajay   (PW4)  states  that   accused   Anwar   and   Vishal

 were beating Yogesh by fist and kick blows.  Omprakash (PW3) is

 totally silent as to who was giving the fist blows or kick blows.

 Ajay claimed that both of them were hitting by fist and kick blows.

 Thus, on this material aspect, there is variance in between them.

 Be that as it may. Both these witnesses are blissfully silent in their

 evidence as to on what part of the body of the deceased kicks and

 fist blows were landing.   As observed in the earlier part of this

 judgment Exh.-27 is silent about kick blows and Exh.-58 is silent

 about the presence of Vishal.

 is reveals that after they noticed that Yogesh fell on the ground,

 they went to the house of Sharda (PW1) for water.   It is quite a

 natural   reaction   on   the   part   of   these   two   witnesses   to   provide

 water in order to make attempt for gaining the senses of Yogesh.

 Their   presence   in   the   house   of   Sharda   is   confirmed   by   Sharda

 herself.  When they reached to the house of Sharda and demanded

 water, she asked as to for what purpose water is required.  In my

 view,   this   was   the   most   natural   human   reaction   on   her   part.

 Interestingly, the answer given to her by these two witnesses was

 that they require water because Yogesh was lying in unconscious

 state in front of her house.

 7assault.     Sharda   then   inquired   Omprakash   (PW3)   regarding

 cause of unconsciousness and the answer given to this lady who

 provided water to these two witnesses was that they do not know

 the reason of unconsciousness and it was further informed to her

 that   when   they   were   passing,   they   noticed   Yogesh   lying   and

 witnesses have seen rains of kick and fist blows on the body of the

 deceased, they would not have missed to point out the said fact to

 Sharda when the cause for unconsciousness was specifically asked

 for by her. Omprakash (PW3) and Ajay (PW4) were all the time

 with Yogesh right from sprinkling of water on his face till he was

 declared dead in the Medical College and Hospital.  Not only that,

 as per the evidence of Ajay (PW4), he accompanied Rekha (PW2)

 to the Police Station, Sakkardara.   Their statements are recorded

 on   the   next   day.     When   Ajay   (PW4)   was   present   in   the   police

 station   at   night   hours   along   with   mother   of   the   deceased   and

 when   he   has   witnessed   the   incident   of   assault   by   kick   and   fist

 blows, keeping silence at Police Station in that behalf is rather not

 only unusual but gives serious blow to the prosecution case.  The

 prosecution has not pointed out any motive.  In fact, there was no

 enmity between the deceased and the accused persons.   Nobody

 knows as to how the incident has started.
