                                Civil Writ Jurisdiction Case No.19849 of 2019
                 ======================================================
                 Arun Kumar S/o Sri Lakshman Paswan Resident of Village- Rajpur, P.o.-
                 Rajpur, P.s.- Rajpur, Distt.- Rohtas

                                                  Versus
           1.    The State of Bihar through the Principal Secretary, Education Department,
                 Bihar, Patna
           2.    The Director Secondary Education, Education Department, Bihar, Patna
           3.    The District Board Employment Committee through its Secretary, Bhojpur,
                 Ara
           4.    The Deputy Development Commissioner-cum-Chief Executive Officer

                 For the Respondent/s   :      Mr. Madhaw Prasad Yadav, G.P. 23
                 ======================================================
                 CORAM: HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE ANIL KUMAR UPADHYAY
                                       ORAL ORDER</pre>

<p id="p_1">2   25-09-2019                 Heard learned counsel for the petitioner and learned

                   counsel appearing for the respondents.

</p><p id="p_2">                               Petitioner is aggrieved by the order contained in

                   'Annexure 1' whereby the petitioner has been terminated from

                   his service on the ground that at the time of appointment, the

                   petitioner was of 20 years 5 months and 10 days old whereas the

                   minimum age prescribed for appointment is 22 years.

</p><p id="p_3">                               Learned counsel for the petitioner has drawn attention

                   of this Court to the concerned Rule 2008 whereby age eligibility

                   has been prescribed, it appears from Rule that there is no

                   minimum age prescribed. It only indicates that the age limit as
         Patna High Court CWJC No.19849 of 2019(2) dt.25-09-2019
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                                   2/2</span>




                  prescribed by the State Government from time to time shall

                  apply.
</p>
<p id="p_4">                              Learned counsel for the petitioner would submit that

                  on the date of appointment the petitioner was 23 years old and

                  he continued in service for a period of ten years and at this stage

                  finding fault with the appointment of the petitioner is most

                  arbitrary exercise of power.
</p>
<p id="p_5">                              Since the rule is salient on the issue of minimum age

                  for appointment and on date of the appointment the petitioner

                  was of 23 years old, the Court does not find any justification in

                  the order of termination of the petitioner contained in 'Annexure

                  1'. 'Annexure 1' is, accordingly, quashed. The respondents are

                  directed to reinstate the petitioner as the petitioner was of 23

                  years old on the date of appointment and as such in the given

                  situation petitioner's appointment cannot be a faulted.

                  allowed and disposed of.
