<p id="p_2">                                             Heard Shri T.H. Bewali, learned counsel for the
                            petitioner   and   Shri   A.M.   Kadukar,   learned   AGP   for   the
                            respondents.
</p>

<p id="p_3">                            2.               The petitioner claiming to be owner of a motor
                            vehicle (Truck No. MH-40 / AK-4712) has approached this
                            Court   assailing   action   of   the   respondents   in   seizing   that
                            truck for allegedly carrying sand without proper documents.
</p>                              
<p id="p_4">                            3.               In   reply,   the   respondents   have   produced   a
                            seizure memo which below the signature of the Tahsildar
                            bears date 02.07.2018 and mentions that the Driver of the
                            vehicle   Shri   Atul   Mohan   Khonde   was   not   having   any
                            documents to support sand which he was transporting.  The
                            seizure memo is signed by the driver Shri A.M. Khonde.  He
                            has declared  name  of  owner  of  truck  to  be   Jeetu  Kawdu
                            Vaidya.     It   appears   that   signature   of   Shri   A.M.   Khonde
                            (Driver)   is   also   obtained   on   supratnama   and   bayan
                            (statement).
</p>

<p id="p_5">                         4.               The   seizure   memo,  supratnama   and   statement,
                         all appear on same piece of paper.   Supratnama is blank
                         and   it   is   not   in   dispute   that   neither   sand   nor   truck   is
                         released on supratnama to anybody.  Similarly, statement is
                         also   blank.     On   that   statement   below   signature   of   A.M.
                         Khonde, name of witness Sanjay Laxman Neware has been
                         mentioned   and   against   that   name,   his   signature   is   also
                         obtained.     The   next   page   is   statement   of   one   Vidyadhar,
                         who supports the act of seizure.  It is signed by Vidyadhar.
                         It is recorded in the presence of Tahsildar.   The Tahsildar
                         has   while   mentioning   date,   done   some   over   writing   in
                         figure "7" indicating month of the year.
</p>

<p id="p_6">                         5.               By notice dated 02.07.2018 addressed to Atul, he
                         was   called   upon   to   remain   present   on   03.07.2018   for
                         hearing.  This notice is received by one S.K. Vaidya.
</p>

<p id="p_7">                         6.               The Tahsildar has produced before this Court an
                         order   sheet   dated   02.07.2018   which   in   opening   part,
                         mentions the fact of seizure and ownership of vehicle with
                         Jeetu Kawdu Vaidya.   This order sheet does not show that
                         any notice was issued to Driver or owner to remain present
                         on 03.07.2018.   Immediately after it, there is order sheet
                         dated   03.07.2018.     It   is   recorded   that   Jeetu   Vaidya
                         remained   present.     He   did   not  produce  any  document   in
                         relation to sand.  On back side, again some proceedings are
                         recorded.   It is not very clear whether it is continuation of
                         earlier order sheet or then some other order sheet.  In those
                         proceedings   it   is   mentioned   that   the   owner   Shri   Jeetu

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4"> 0410wp4700.18                                                                             3</span>

                         Vaidya appeared.  In margin it is recorded that Shri Vaidya
                         refused to sign.
</p>

<p id="p_8">                         7.               On first page of order sheet, where orders dated
                         02.07.2018 and 03.07.2018 appear, in margin, there is one
                         signature which appears to be somewhat like signature of
                         present   petitioner.     However,   the   learned   counsel   has
                         declined the same.  He is relying upon R.C. book and other
                         records to urge that truck does not belong to Jeetu Vaidya.
                         However, it is an admitted position, even by him, that Atul
                         M. Khonde is driver of that truck.
</p>

<p id="p_9">                         8.               The affidavit of driver is not produced before this
                         Court to show that he did not disclose Jeetu to be the owner
                         of truck.  No affidavit is filed by the driver urging that truck
                         was not seized from him or then at the relevant time it was
                         not carrying sand.
</p>

<p id="p_10">                         9.               We, in this situation, find that several disputed
                         questions arise.   Not only this, even the petitioner has not
                         approached   this   Court   with   clean   hands.     We,   therefore,
                         refuse   to   intervene   in   extra-ordinary   jurisdiction.     Writ
                         petition is dismissed.   However, there shall be no order as
                         to costs.
