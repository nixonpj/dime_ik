<p id="p_7">           submitted the report dated 24.4.2015 with the conclusion that the date of

           birth of the applicant-appellant No.2, Rajinder Singh was 19.12.1984 and

           as such, he was juvenile on the date of occurrence i.e., 11.08.2002.

</p><p id="p_8">                                Learned State Counsel submitted that such a plea regarding age

           of the applicant-appellant No. 2 was not taken before learned trial Judge

           during the trial i.e. at the time of framing of charge, recording of statement

           under <a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_8">Section 313</a> Cr.P.C.and at the time of passing order regarding

           quantum of sentence. So, this plea is not tenable at this stage.

</p><p id="p_9">                                As per Section 7-A of the Act,   the claim of juvenility can be

           raised at any stage and before any Court.               Such a view was taken by

           Hon`ble Supreme Court in Anil Agarwal and another Vs. State of West

           Bengal,              2012[2] R.C.R. [Criminal] 450.      Similar issue was before

           Hon`ble Supreme Court in Jitender Singh Vs. State of U.P., [2013] 11

           SCC 193 and it has been held that a claim of juvenility can be raised by a

           person at any stage and before any Court. However, there is no provision

           to set-aside the conviction of the juvenile on the ground that on the date of

           commission of the offence he was a juvenile and hence not triable by an

           ordinary criminal court.             Applying the maxim of     expressio unius est

           exclusio alterius, it would be reasonable to hold that the law insofar as it

           requires a reference to be made to the Board excludes by necessary

           implication any intention on the part of the legislature requiring the courts to

           set-aside the conviction recorded by the lower court.               Parliament was

           content with setting aside the sentence of imprisonment awarded to the

           juvenile and making of a reference to the Board without specifically or by

           implication requiring the court concerned to alter or set-aside the
