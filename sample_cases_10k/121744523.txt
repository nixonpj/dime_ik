<p id="p_1">                  (Per: HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE KISHORE KUMAR MANDAL)

7   04-09-2017                 We have heard Mr. Satyavrat Verma, learned counsel
                   for all the appellants and learned Additional Public Prosecutors
                   separately appearing for the State in the different appeals.
</p><p id="p_2">                               In two cognate trials, the learned trial court convicted
                   the appellants of these four appeals for offence under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_1">sections
                   302</a>/<a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_2">34</a> and <a href="/doc/386021/" id="a_3">201</a>/<a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_4">34</a> of the Indian Penal Code. PW 8 of Cr.
                   Appeal (DB) No.403 of 2017 lodged information about the
                   tracelessness of his brother. The following day, his dead body
                   was found sacked in two bags thrown in a pond. The trial court
                   on appreciating the evidence laid in these two trials held that the
                   charges levelled against the appellants have been proved. In the
                   second trial, of which Cr. Appeal (DB) Nos. 407, 420 and 406
                   of 2017 arise, apart from the circumstantial evidence, the court
                   found PW 10 as an ocular witness to the killing of the brother of
                   the informant.
</p><p id="p_3">                               Mr. Verma, has criticized the judgment on several
                   grounds. He stated that the chain of circumstances proved at the
                   trial do not conclusively prove the guilt of the appellants. The
                   motive for the occurrence has not been firmly established.
                   Criticizing the evidence of PW 10, it is submitted that this
                   witness presented himself before the Investigating Officer
                   several months after the occurrence for his CD statement.
</p><p id="p_4">                               Counsels for the State and the informant opposed the
                   prayer. It is submitted that in the first trial itself, of which Cr.
                   Appeal (DB) No.403 of 2017 arises, at least three witnesses
                   have spoken about the deceased having been seen last with the
                   appellants. Apart from that in the second trial, of which Cr.

<p id="p_5">                    Appeal (DB) Nos. 407, 420 and 406 of 2017 arise, PW 10 is the
                    eye witness to the occurrence. His late appearance before the
                    Investigating Officer for C.D. statement is well explained.
</p><p id="p_6">                                Considering the submissions made at the Bar and after
                    going through the nature of incriminating materials available on
                    record against the appellants, we are not inclined to direct their
                    release. The prayer for bail is rejected.

                     in the trial in respect of all the three appellants of Cr. Appeal
                     (D.B.) No. 403 of 2017, namely, Rajesh Chaudhary, Naresh
                     Chaudhary and Akhilesh Chaudhary, we grant them liberty to
                     renew prayer for bail if the appeal is not taken up for final
                     hearing within a year.
