        learned Single Judge rejecting its petition under <a href="/doc/1722761/" id="a_1">Section 34</a> of the
       Arbitration and <a href="/doc/1306164/" id="a_2">Conciliation Act</a>, 1996 (hereinafter 'the Act'). That
       petition has challenged an Arbitration Award dated 10.06.2015. The
       dispute between the parties arose on account of the payment under a
       consultancy services agreement entered into by the respondent-M/s
       Intercontinental Consultant and Technocrats Pvt. Ltd. (hereinafter
       'ICT') with NHAI on 28.01.2002.
</p>
<p id="p_6">       2.     The    dispute   arose   sometime    in   2012    pertaining       to
       reimbursement of income tax to the tune of `66,37,332/-. These were
       referred to the Arbitral Tribunal under the Act. After considering the
       rival pleadings and submissions of the parties, the Tribunal accepted
       the claim of the ICT and awarded a sum of over `67 lacs (which was
       later modified by learned Single Judge) and further sum of
       `25,52,799/- - both with interest @ 10% per annum.
</p>
<p id="p_7">       3.     NHAI objected to the award primarily on the construction
       placed by the Tribunal with respect to the two conditions in the
       Agreement (Clauses 1.10.1 and 1.10.2). They read as follows:

<blockquote id="blockquote_11">       4.     NHAI urges that the learned Single Judge fell into error because
       the Tribunal proceeded beyond the terms of the contract inasmuch as
       for domestic consultants it was not liable to pay or refund income tax.
</blockquote><p id="p_8">       That was wholly the liability of consultants. It was urged that thus the
       personnel employed by ICT were not covered by either of the
       conditions (Clauses 1.10.1 or 1.10.2).
</p>
<p id="p_9">       5.     After considering the submissions and the award, the learned
       Single Judge held as follows:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_12">                     "12. A perusal of Clause 1.10.2. of GCC clearly shows
                     that under the said clause, the petitioner had agreed to
                     pay on behalf of its consultants/sub-consultant any taxes,
                     duties etc. imposed in India on the consultant or sub-
                     consultant in respect of any payment made directly by
                     the petitioner to the consultants/sub-consultants in
                     connection with carrying out the services. Merely,
                     because the word 'personnel' is not used in the said
                     clause, in my opinion would not make any material
                     difference. The petitioner admits that foreign personnel
                     engaged by foreign consultants would under Clause
                     1.10.2 of the GCC be eligible for reimbursement of the
                     tax paid to the Government on account of the
                     remuneration received by such foreign personnel. To
                     interpret this clause, to mean that the same contention
                     would also be applicable to foreign personnel based


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">FAO(OS) (COMM) 162/2018                                            Page 4 of 7</span>
                      abroad who are engaged by Indian consultants appears
                     to be a plausible and a possible interpretation of Clause
                     1.10.2.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_13">                     13. I have already noted above, the grounds on which the
                     learned Arbitrator has taken the above noted view. He
                     has on facts concluded that the project in question is a
                     world bank project and the world bank norm is to
                     reimburse the consultants for taxes that have been
                     reimbursed to foreign personnel. There were no cogent
                     reasons given by the petitioner as to why the same system
                     is not to be followed for the present agreement.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_14">                     14. The learned Arbitrator has also noted the plea of the
                     petitioner that clause 1.10.2 of the agreement applies
                     only to foreign consultants and the foreign personnel
                     whom they engage and does not apply to foreign
                     personnel engaged by Indian consultants. It was noted
                     that the tender was a global tender and it could not have
                     been intended by the parties to discriminate between
                     Indian bidders and foreign bidders. If the interpretation
                     sought to be proposed by the petitioner was accepted, it
                     would mean that an Indian bidder, namely, an Indian
                     Consultant would have to pay for the tax liability for the
                     foreign personnel whereas a foreign consultant would not
                     have any such liability. Clearly, no such intent could be
                     possible.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_15">                     15. The third ground given by the learned Arbitrator was
                     the difference in the wording of Appendix G and H of the
                     agreement. Annexure H deals with summary of costs in
                     local currency. The said appendix describes the cost net
                     of tax. Appendix G deals with costs in foreign currency
                     and includes remuneration for Expatriate Staff. The said
                     appendix leaves the column of 'taxes and duties' blank in
                     view of the fact that they may vary in future. The columns
                     state that the duties and taxes will be payable by the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">FAO(OS) (COMM) 162/2018                                            Page 5 of 7</span>
                      petitioner as per applicable law and as per clause 1.10 of
                     the Special Conditions of the agreement. Implicit in this
                     was that it was the liability of the petitioner to pay for the
                     tax liability of foreign consultants/personnel."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_10">       6.     The learned Single Judge also relied upon the judgment of the
       Supreme Court in â€ž<a href="/doc/996348/" id="a_3">Mcdermott International Inc vs. Burn Standard Co.
       Ltd. &amp; Ors</a>.â€Ÿ, (2006) 11 SCC 181 and the later judgment in â€ž<a href="/doc/31621011/" id="a_4">Associate
       Builders vs. Delhi Development Authority</a>â€Ÿ, (2015) 3 SCC 49 in both
       of which the Court held that the decision as to the construction or
       interpretation of the terms of the contract fall within the exclusive
       domain of the Arbitrator and that the error, if any, cannot, in our
       opinion, of such interpretation ordinarily ought not to be corrected or
       interfered with. The NHAI has more or less reiterated its submissions.
       Before this Court it was argued that the difference between two
       conditions meant that the personnel covered by Clause 1.10.1 could
       not avail the benefit of refund of tax and that the absence of the term
       personnel or employee precluded the Tribunal from awarding the
       amounts which did not relate to consultants. This Court is of the
       opinion that there is no merit in that argument. Besides the same
       argument and submissions were gone into by the Tribunal which gave
       proper justifications for its conclusions. Learned Single Judge also,
       after careful scrutiny, endorsed that view. Given the limited scope of
       the Appellate jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1656413/" id="a_5">Section 37</a> of the Act, interference is
       not called for. Besides the distinction pointed out by the NHAI, to our
       mind, is entirely unsustainable.      The distinction between the two
       Clauses 1.10.1 and Clause 1.10.2 lies as the difference between the
       nature of residents and whereas the former covers those permanent

        residents in India, the latter covers those who have foreign residence.
       A foreign consultant, by whatever name called, as long as it functions
       in relation to the project, regardless of such labour, would ordinarily
       fall within Clause 1.10.2 as was held in this case.

       dismissed along with the pending application.
