<p id="p_1">BEFORE : HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE RAJAN GUPTA

Present:     Mr. J.K. Sibal, Sr. Advocate with
             Mr. Sapan Dhir, Advocate for the petitioners.
</p>
<p id="p_2">RAJAN GUPTA J. (ORAL)

              Present revision petition is directed against the order

passed by the court below restoring the suit.
</p>
<p id="p_3">             Brief factual background of the case is that civil suit for

separate possession by way of partition of the suit land was filed by

plaintiffs before the civil court at Gurgaon.              Suit was filed on

02.01.2009.      Issues were framed on 18.08.2009.                Trial court

started    recording   the   evidence    of   plaintiffs    thereafter.       On

08.10.2010, plaintiff-Depak Mathur appeared before the court and

tendered his affidavit to be read as his examination-in-chief. Case

was thereafter adjourned to 09.11.2010.            On said date, plaintiff

could not appear before the court below. Trial court invoked Order 9

Rule 8 of CPC and dismissed the suit.           Shortly thereafter i.e. on

06.12.2010, an application was moved for restoration of the suit.

Trial court, however, dismissed the application on 07.01.2012. An

appeal was filed before the Additional District Judge, Gurgaon.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1"> C.R. No. 276 of 2013                                            2</span>




Same has been allowed by the court observing that parties had

been appearing before the trial court on each and every date. The

suit, therefore, deserves to be decided on merits.

</p><p id="p_4">           Aggrieved by said order, present revision petition has

been preferred.   Mr. Sibal, learned senior counsel has submitted

that appellate court had erred in restoring the suit.         He has

emphasized that plaintiff, Deepak Mathur made a wrong statement

before the court that he had booked a ticket to travel to Delhi but

could not do so due to heavy rush at the airport. According to him,

this statement is incorrect as would be clear from, Annexure P-1.

According to him, booking was cancelled by plaintiff-Deepak Mathur

himself on 08.11.2010.      His application has, thus, been wrongly

accepted by the court below.
</p>
<p id="p_5">           I have heard learned counsel for the petitioner.

           Suit was dismissed on 09.11.2010.           Application for

restoration was filed within a period of 30 days. Before 09.11.2010

there was no default on part of the plaintiffs.      Applicant-Deepak

Mathur had appeared before the court on 08.10.2010 and his

examination in chief was completed.       The case was, thereafter

adjourned on the request of defendant to cross-examine Deepak

Mathur.   However, due to inability of applicant Deepak Mathur to

appear before the court on 09.11.2010, suit was dismissed by

invoking Order 9 Rule 8 of CPC. Application for restoration was also

dismissed by trial court.   In my considered view lower appellate

court has rightly allowed the appeal and restored the suit.      Only

contention raised before this court is that application did not

approach the court with clean hands as he had made a wrong

statement before the court.    Admittedly, petitioners have already

filed application under <a href="/doc/908644/" id="a_1">section 340</a> Cr.P.C. before the concerned

court regarding false statement/affidavit, if any, made before the

court.   Thus, there is no ground for interference in revisional

jurisdiction of this court. Revision petition is without any merit and

is hereby dismissed.
