     THIS PETITION COMING ON FOR ADMISSION THIS DAY,

<p id="p_1">     Having heard the learned counsel for the parties,

perused the pleadings and examined the order dated

03.08.2012 in Original Application No.453/2011 of the

Central   Administrative    Tribunal   (for    short     'CAT'),

days,     whereafterwards,     since      pension      was     not

sanctioned, on the premise of not having completed

minimum ten years of service, filed O.A.No.453/2011

before the CAT, Bangalore Bench. The Member of the

said bench having regard to the order dated 23.03.2011

in O.A.No.245/2010 of the CAT, Madras Bench, allowed

the application. Hence this petition.


</p><p id="p_4">        3. It is pointed out that in almost similar

circumstances though not             identical,    CAT,   Madras

Bench in O.A.No.880 to 884 of 2010 - Annexure-R3

having    extracted   the    order     dated      31.01.2011    in

O.A.Nos.786/2010, 798/2010 and 1025/2010 and the

facts obtaining therein that the applicant joined service

as ED Packer on 04.05.1964 and worked as such till

31.12.1987 and when selected to Group-D post joined

on 01.01.1988 and retired on 30.09.1997, thereby

rendering 9 years and 9 months of service, though did

not complete ten years of minimum qualifying service

for pension, nevertheless, was extended the benefit

making it clear that the relief granted was confined only

to that case and should not be treated as a precedent

and applying the same rejected the applications.


</p><p id="p_5">     4.    There being no dispute that the respondent

ought to have completed a minimum qualifying service

of 10 years, while having served for 9 years 1 month

and 28 days as D-Group employee, was disentitled to

pension benefit.
</p>
<p id="p_6">
</p><p id="p_7">     5. Regard being had to the fact that the order in

O.A.No.1264/2001 of the CAT, Madras Bench as

extracted at paragraph 25 in O.A.Nos.880 to 884 of

2010 - Annexure-R3, not to operate as a precedent, but

confined to the facts of that case, the CAT, Bangalore

Bench having not noticed the same, fell in error in

allowing the respondents' application for grant of

pension.

</p><p id="p_10">        6. The rules relating to payment of pension do not

disclose any relaxation in the matter of treating a lesser

period       of     service   for    extending      pension,    more

appropriately, in relaxing the period of ten months so as

to reckon 9 years 1 month and 28 days as 10 years.


</p><p id="p_11">        7.        The Apex Court, having considered the

applicability of Articles 16 and 14 of Constitution of

India to Recruitment Process and Selection Process so

as     to    strictly   adhere      to    the   stipulated   selection

procedure in the case of <a href="/doc/1327689/" id="a_1">BEDANGA TALUKDAR vs.

SAIFUDAULLAH KHAN AND OTHERS</a> 1, observed thus:


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">                  "32. xxx. It is settled law that there can
        be no relaxation in the terms and conditions
        contained in the advertisement unless the
        power of relaxation is duly reserved in the
        relevant rules and/or in the advertisement.
        Even if there is a power of relaxation in the
        rules, the same would still have to be
        specifically indicated in the advertisement. In

     the present case, no such rule has been
     brought to our notice. In such circumstances,
     the High Court could not have issued the
     impugned direction to consider the claim of
     Respondent 1 on the basis of identity card
     submitted after the selection process was
     over, with the publication of the select list."</blockquote><p id="p_12">



</p><p id="p_13">     8. Applying the aforesaid observation to the facts

of this case and keeping in mind that the respondent

served the petitioner for 9 years 1 month and 28 days

as D-Group employee and not 10 years, the minimum

period of service for benefit of pension, the rules not

shown to invest a power of relaxation of ten months, the

CAT, Bangalore Bench was not justified in allowing the

application and extending the benefit of pension to the

respondent.
</p>
<p id="p_14">
</p><p id="p_15">     9. In our considered opinion, the order impugned

is illegal and unsustainable.

impugned is quashed and the application rejected.
