Bussan Auto Finance India Pvt. Ltd.,
Having its office at

ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">              The present application U/s 9 of the Arbitration and <a href="/doc/1306164/" id="a_1">Conciliation Act</a>,
1996 is filed by the petitioner alongwith an application for ex-parte appointment of
receiver to take the possession of the vehicle Make MOTORCYCLE YAMAHA FZ-
S, bearing Registration No. DL13S-4461.
</p>
<p id="p_2">              Heard ld. counsel for the petitioner on the application U/s 9 of the
Arbitration and <a href="/doc/1306164/" id="a_2">Conciliation Act</a>, 1996.
</p>
<p id="p_3">              The petitioner had financed a sum of Rs.48,000/- to the respondent for
the purchase of above referred vehicle on execution of documents, details of which
are given in the application. In pursuance to the loan agreement the respondent
agreed to adhere to the repayment schedule and entered into a vehicle loan-cum-
hypothecation agreement. The loan amount was agreed to be paid in 36
installments of Rs.1855/- each. It is submitted by ld. counsel that the respondent
has not adhered to the repayment schedule and has defaulted in repayment of 32
monthly installments and a sum of Rs.68,890/- is due from him on the date of filing
of the petition. In this regard authorised representative of the petitioner has filed his
affidavit in support of the amount due from the respondent. It is further submitted on

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                            -: 2 :-</span>

behalf of the petitioner that despite service of demand notice respondent did not
come forward to clear the outstanding amount. Hence there is an apprehension that
respondent might sell the vehicle. In that case it would not be possible to recover
the loan amount from the respondent. Therefore, a prayer is made for appointment
of receiver who shall take the possession/interim custody of the abovesaid vehicle.
</p>
<p id="p_4">              I have heard the arguments on behalf of the petitioner and gone
through the record carefully.
</p>
<p id="p_5">              The claim of the petitioner is supported by necessary documents.
Respondent is alleged to have failed to comply with the terms and conditions of the
loan agreement. The vehicle was hypothecated to the petitioner. As the respondent
prima facie failed to comply with the terms and conditions of the loan agreement, the
agreement was terminated by the petitioner by serving legal notice. There is an
arbitration clause in the agreement between the parties.
</p>
<p id="p_6">              Considering all the documents placed on record and the facts and
circumstances I am satisfied that it is a fit case where before issuing notice to the
respondent a receiver be appointed to take possession/interim custody of the
vehicle. Hence, I allow the application U/s 9 of the Arbitration and <a href="/doc/1306164/" id="a_3">Conciliation Act</a>,
1996 and appoint Sh.Amit Ranna, as receiver with a direction to take back the
possession/custody of vehicle make MOTORCYCLE YAMAHA FZ-S, bearing
Registration No. DL13S-4461, from whosoever and wheresoever is in possession
of the vehicle till the next date of the case. The receiver shall keep the vehicle in
safe custody and shall not dispose of the same without the permission of the court.
He shall produce the same in the court as and when directed and shall also file the
report within three days of the seizure of the vehicle in the court.
</p>

<p id="p_7">              At the time of seizure of the vehicle the receiver shall issue appropriate
receipt to the person from whose custody the vehicle is taken, shall get the vehicle

photographed and shall note down the reading of the odometer and shall also get
the vehicle inspected from an authorised work shop with respect to the condition of
the vehicle and make a full inventory of the accessories affixed on the vehicle. He
shall not use the vehicle for any purpose whatsoever and he shall ensure that the
vehicle is kept in same condition in which it was received by him.
</p>
<p id="p_8">              In case the payment of due installments upto the date of the seizure of
the vehicle is made by the respondent to the petitioner, the petitioner shall issue
receipt of the said payment and the order of seizure shall not be enforced and if he
has already seized the vehicle then the vehicle shall be released to the respondent
immediately without delay.
</p>
<p id="p_9">              The receiver shall furnish a security bond in the sum of Rs.68,890/- in
the court.
</p>
<p id="p_10">              The receiver is also granted permission to take assistance of the
police, if required, for the purpose of seizure of the vehicle.
</p>
<p id="p_11">              Nothing in this order shall tantamount to expression of my opinion on
the final merits of the case.
</p>
<p id="p_12">              Copy of the order be given dasti to the ld. counsel for the petitioner as
prayed.
