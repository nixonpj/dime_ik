7/08.10.2015</pre><p id="p_1">        Both these applications arise out of the same case, as such they are being
             disposed of by this common order.
</p><p id="p_2">                    Heard learned counsels for the petitioners and learned counsel for the State.
                    Petitioners have been made accused for the offence under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_1">Sections 302</a>/<a href="/doc/386021/" id="a_2">201</a>/<a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_3">34</a> of
             the Indian Penal Code, in connection with Nirsa P.S. Case No.391 of 2014, corresponding
             to G.R. No.4368 of 2014.
</p><p id="p_3">                    The dead body of an unknown person was recovered and the case was instituted
             against unknown. During the course of investigation, it transpired that the dead body was
             of a driver of the vehicle, which was booked by the petitioners and the petitioners after
             committing the murder, had taken away the vehicle to Dumrao.
</p><p id="p_4">                    It has been submitted by the learned counsel for the petitioners that the petitioners
             have been made accused in this case only on the basis of the confessional statement of
             the co-accused and subsequently one witness at Dumrao had stated that the petitioners
             were also in the vehicle when the vehicle was brought to Dumrao. Learned counsel
             submitted that the said witness Jitendra Singh has been examined as PW-1 in the Court
             below and he has turned hostile. The deposition of the said witness has been brought on
             record. Learned counsel accordingly, prayed for bail.
</p><p id="p_5">                    Learned counsel for the State has opposed the prayer but upon going through the
             case diary, it is admitted that the petitioners are named only in the confessional statement
             of the co-accused as also in the statement of the said witness Jitendra Singh.
</p><p id="p_6">                    In the facts and circumstances of the case, I am inclined to release the petitioners
             on bail. Accordingly, the petitioner Amar Kumar Rishi and Rajendra Ravidas are directed
             to be released on bail, on furnishing bail bonds of Rs.10,000/- (Rupees Ten Thousand)
             each with two sureties of like amount each to the satisfaction of Sri B.K. Lal, learned
             Judicial Magistrate, Dhanbad, or his successor, in connection with           Nirsa P.S. Case
             No.391 of 2014, corresponding to G.R. No.4368 of 2014.
