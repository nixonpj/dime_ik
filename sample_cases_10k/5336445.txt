    CORAM: HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE AJAY KUMAR TRIPATHI
    ORAL JUDGMENT
    Date: 1-05-2015

                     A large number of writ applications came to be filed after the

    Bihar Staff Selection Commission notified the result on 9.2.2015 for

    appointment on the post of Auxiliary Nurses Midwife (ANM). All the writ

    applications made one allegation or the other against the Staff Selection

    Commission against the manner such exercise for selection had been carried

    out, which, according to the petitioners, require interference by the Court.
</p>
<p id="p_760">                     2. The allegations are that proper marking for academic and

    training have not been given to candidates. In fact, people, who deserve

    less marks for experience, have been given more marks and people with

    more experience have been given less marks. It is also insinuated that for

    mala fide reason, a cut-off marks was introduced for interview, which has

    created undue discrimination against the present petitioners as people have

    been given marks in interview who were favourites. Besides, there was no

    provision for keeping minimum cut-off marks for interview but the Staff

    Selection Commission still decided to do so                which has created

    unnecessary impediment in the selection and appointment of the petitioners

    on the post of ANM.

    vacancies of 3930 on the post of ANMs. The details of eligibility etc. were

    provided for in the advertisement also notified on the website of the

    Commission. Thousands of applicants applied online.                On the basis of

    declaration and details provided by candidates, check list was prepared,

    tabulation was done and thereafter on conduct of interview, marks came to

    be awarded and merit list prepared. The category wise vacancies with the

    number of recommended candidates, requiring minimum qualifying marks

    for interview for various categories and cut-off marks of recommended

    candidates have been drawn up in a tabulatory form was tendered before

    this Court, which is reproduced herein below :

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">                     4. The above table has been reproduced because the entire

    results of the candidates have been declared within the parameters indicated

    above. Besides the same, a detailed counter affidavit has also been filed on

    behalf of the Bihar Staff Selection Commission denying any wrong doing in

    the exercise carried out by them for selection on the post of ANMs. They

    have explained the mechanism adopted for selection of ANMs and

    according to them, there is no deviation of any kind. It is the stand of the

    counsel for the respondent Staff Selection Commission that majority of

    these allegations are more made than made out and the allegations have

    been made only to create prejudice and to frustrate the selection process and

    appointment since for a long period of time the appointments have not been

    made on the post of ANMs. Public at large are suffering due to such

    vacancies.</blockquote>

<p id="p_762">                     5. Many a counsels appeared before the Court in their writ

    applications and a list of candidates with their roll numbers was furnished to

    the Court, which are said to be gross cases, which establish the wrong doing

    on the part of the Staff Selection Commission. Those roll numbers were

    picked up and furnished to the counsel for Staff Selection Commission to
 Patna High Court CWJC No.3634 of 2015 dt.01-05-2015

                                        39 /42




    verify about either non- award of marks of experience or academic

    qualification, the caste or category, which the candidates belong etc. etc.

</p><p id="p_763">                     6. To be fair to the Commission, the counsel on the very next

    date produced a declaration where the details of all the candidates, whose

    roll numbers were furnished to the Court, which included their original

    application, the check list, the marks so awarded as per the results. The

    above information was also shared with the counsels representing different

    petitioners and except for nit-picking nothing tangible emerged, which

    could support the allegation made with regard to procedure adopted for

    award of marks in the academic, the experience and the interview. The

    Court, therefore, did come to a considered opinion that all the allegations

    are more made than made out.
</p>
<p id="p_764">                     7. In addition to the above, counsel for the Staff Selection

    Commission furnished to the Court the complete tabulation sheet of all the

    candidates, which does indicate the true position as to which candidate

    stood where. The Court did an exercise of random checking of award of

    marks etc. and the merit position of such candidates. None of the counels

    could pinpoint any discrepancy depending on their over all marks position.
</p>
<p id="p_765">    No wrong was found in the manner the tabulation had been done with

    regard to each and every candidate, based on which the final merit list for

    various categories came to be drawn up and notified.
</p>
<p id="p_766">                     8. Counsel for the Staff Selection Commission also produced
 Patna High Court CWJC No.3634 of 2015 dt.01-05-2015

                                        40 /42




    before this Court the final merit list of selected and notified candidates. The

    recommendations have been made on the basis of number of vacancies

    against various categories of candidates, the cut-off marks, the percentage

    etc. which has already been reproduced in earlier part of the order.
</p>
<p id="p_767">                     9. On verification of the entire material by the Court and after

    giving a very extensive and patient hearing to the counsel for the

    petitioners, the Court comes to only one considered opinion that the

    allegations made against the Staff Selection Commission with regard to

    wrong doing in the exercise for appointment of ANMs was mischievous,

    false and without any substance. All these writ applications have been

    basically filed by the disgruntled candidates, who have not been able to

    succeed in the exercise conducted by the Staff Selection Commission for

    the post of ANMs.
</p>
<p id="p_768">                     10. Coming to the question of keeping a cut-off marks in the

    interview, this Court had occasion to deal with an identical submission in

    the matter of appointment of ANMs Grade A which was the case of <a href="/doc/65333740/" id="a_1">Uganta

    Kumari and others v. the State and others</a> i.e. CWJC No.20709 of 2014 and

    other analogous cases, decided on 15.4.2015.
</p>
<p id="p_769">                     11. The Court had this to say :
</p>
<p id="p_770">                          "Keeping cut off marks for interview cannot be said
                     to be alien to concept of recruitment and selection.
                     Looking at the above marks, which was assigned for
                     interview as well as the percentage indicated above, it is
 Patna High Court CWJC No.3634 of 2015 dt.01-05-2015

                                        41 /42




                     further held by this Court that the same cannot be said
                     to be arbitrary or discriminatory. After all, the post of
                     GNM is an important post, especially of Grade „A‟
                     Nurse. There is an onerous duty to not only take care of
                     patients but even administer medication correctly in
                     terms of the direction of the treating doctors. These
                     days they even have to handle many sophisticated
                     medical equipments as well.
</p><p id="p_771">                          Many a times, candidates obtain degrees across the
                     board from various institutions but that by itself cannot
                     be treated to be the basis for judging somebody‟s
                     capability and competence. In fact, conduct of interview
                     has importance. Since the percentage of cut off for
                     such interview is minimal, therefore, all those, who did
                     not qualify in interview, are not required to be selected.
                     In totality, this was a case where more heat was
                     generated on wild allegations about selection process,
                     which had been conducted by the Bihar Staff Selection
                     Commission, rather than actual state of affairs, on
                     verification."

<p id="p_772">                     12. The above quote is a complete answer to the submission of

    the counsels with regard to keeping cut-off marks in interview for the

    candidates.
</p>
<p id="p_773">                     13. In totality, therefore, though initially this Court did put an

    order of restraint of appointments on the basis of recommendation and the

    results so declared by the Staff Selection Commission, the same is required
          Patna High Court CWJC No.3634 of 2015 dt.01-05-2015

                                                 42 /42




             to be now withdrawn.               All the writ applications are required to be

             dismissed as, prima facie, the Court is satisfied that there is no unfairness

             or lack of fair play in the exercise done for selection of ANMs by the Staff

             Selection Commission.
</p>
<p id="p_774">                              14. The Commission is, therefore, directed to recommend the

             names for appointment and the State is ordered to appint the recommended

             candidates without further delay as enough time has already been lost on

             the litigation.
</p>
<p id="p_775">                            15. Before parting, if any candidate has any doubt left with

             regard to award of marks etc. in relation to her/ him, she/he has freedom to

             approach the secretary of the commission to settle any lurking doubt still

             left in her/his mind.
