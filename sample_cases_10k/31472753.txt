</p><p id="p_4">     2.   It is the case of the petitioner that he has three

daughters, who are married and well settled in life.    The

eldest daughter of the petitioner viz., Mrs. Sabina Krishna

was working in HP from the year 2000 to 2008.    During the

said period, one of her team members had a matrimonial

dispute and had filed a matrimonial case before the Family

Court.    In the said case, unwarranted allegations on wrong

assumptions were made against the petitioner's daughter -

Mrs. Sabina Krishna and she was made a party to the said

proceedings.       Aggrieved by the same, the petitioner's

daughter - Mrs. Sabina Krishna filed W.P. No.37988/2010

to quash the order dated 19.10.2010 passed by the Family

Court dismissing her application to delete her name from

the array of parties in the Matrimonial case.    This Court

after hearing both the parties by the order dated 1.3.2011

allowed the writ petition and set aside the impugned order

passed by the Family Court and the application filed by the

petitioner's daughter - Mrs. Sabina Krishna seeking deletion
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                   4</span>



of her name from the array of parties, came to be allowed

and directed for deletion of her name in the matrimonial

case.
</p>
<p id="p_5">
</p><p id="p_6">        3.    It is further case of the petitioner that the

daughter of the petitioner viz., Mrs. Sabina Krishna, went

through very trying times during the case and had to leave

the job. The society is very unforgiving and she had to face

the brunt of it for absolutely no fault of hers.    Inspite of the

order passed by this Court, the display of the case as a

search result       is tarnishing the    petitioner's daughter's

image, causing undue hardship, humiliation to her and her

family.      Therefore the petitioner is before this Court for the

reliefs sought for.
</p>
<p id="p_7">
</p><p id="p_8">        4. I have heard the learned counsel for the parties to

the lis.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                    5</span><p id="p_9">



</p><p id="p_10">        5. Sri    Manjunath K.V., learned              counsel   for   the

petitioner contended that inspite of the order passed by this

Court     dated   1.3.2011       made      in   W.P.    No.37988/2010

directing to delete the name of the petitioner's daughter -

Sabina Krishna from the array of parties in the Matrimonial

Case, the display of his daughter's name in public domain

by way of result in a search engine is still subsisting.               He

would further contend that the right to privacy is held in

high esteem in the Indian Constitution and moreso when it

relates to a woman. The said order carries the name of the

petitioner's     daughter   in    public    domain       causing   grave

negative impact on the petitioner's daughter and their

family.      He would further contend that the grievance of

the petitioner is not of the publication of the said order on

the High Court website, but it is only to the extent of said

soft copy, indicating the name of the petitioner's daughter

viz., Mrs. Sabina Krishna and resultantly the same being

made available in public domain, upon search by use of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                               6</span>



search engine.    That will come in the way of the petitioner

daughter's married life. Therefore he sought to allow the

writ petition.
</p>
<p id="p_11">
</p><p id="p_12">      6. Per contra, Sri M.A. Subramani, learned HCGP

appearing for the respondent submits that since petitioner's

daughter was made a party in W.P. No.37988/2010 and the

said order being released and uploaded, the name of the

petitioner's daughter viz., Mrs. Sabina Krishna is available

in the website, upon search by use of search engine and

necessary action will be initiated in terms of the order

passed by this Court. The said fair submission is placed on

record.
</p>
<p id="p_13">
</p><p id="p_14">      7. Having heard the learned counsel for the parties, it

is not in dispute that the petitioner's daughter - Mrs.

Sabina Krishna filed writ petition No.37988/2010 before this

Court against the order dated 19.10.2010 made in M.C.

No.2666/07 dismissing her application to delete her name
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                   7</span>



from the array of parties in the Matrimonial case.            This

Court on perusal of the petition averments, recorded a

finding that in the petition filed under Section 10(1)(ix)&amp;(x)

of the <a href="/doc/806295/" id="a_1">Divorce Act</a>, 1969, by one Mrs. Monisha, this Court

do not find any allegations of adulterous life being led by

the husband of 2nd respondent therein with the present

petitioner's daughter and <a href="/doc/1387951/" id="a_2">Section 10(i)</a> of the Divorce Act

provides specifically adultery as one of the grounds for

dissolution of the marriage and ultimately allowed the writ

petition and set aside the order passed by the Family Court

and   the   application   filed   by   the   present   petitioner's

daughter seeking deletion of her name from the array of

parties in the Matrimonial Case, came to be allowed.           The

grievance of the petitioner is that the digitization of the

records has resulted in the name of the petitioner's

daughter being available in the website of the High Court

through search engine.      Since the same has caused certain

embarrassment and hardship to the petitioner's daughter,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                              8</span>



the petitioner   is before this Court seeking that       her

daughter's name be removed/masked from the digital

records maintained by the High Court in respect of W.P.

No.37988/2010 dated 1.3.2011.
</p>
<p id="p_15">
</p><p id="p_16">     8.    Though the petitioner's daughter could have

approached this Court, the petitioner who is unable to

tolerate the embarrassment to his daughter has approached

this Court. On careful perusal of the order passed by this

Court dated 1.3.2011 made in W.P. No.37988/2010, it

clearly depicts that this Court has considered the request

and allowed the application filed by the present petitioner's

daughter to delete her name from the array of parties in

the Matrimonial Case.
</p>
<p id="p_17">
</p><p id="p_18">      9. In view of the aforesaid reasons, the writ petition

is allowed.   The Registry is directed to mask/delete the

name of the petitioner's daughter viz. Mrs. Sabina Krishna

from the digital records relating to W.P. No.37988/2010 as
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                 9</span>



also the order relating to this case and other records, if any

wherein the name of the petitioner would appear.          The

same shall be complied on a copy of this order being

furnished to the Registry.
</p>
<p id="p_19">
</p><p id="p_20">        10.   The Copy of this order shall be furnished to the

learned Government Pleader as well as to the Registry of

this Court for implementation of the order at the earliest.
