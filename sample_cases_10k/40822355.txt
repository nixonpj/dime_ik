         the matter is taken up for final hearing today.
</p>

<p id="p_4">         4.    Filing of Exh.18 by the present appellant in Special Civil
         Suit No.130 of 2015 and passing of the order therein has led
         the appellant to file the present Appeal from Order.

HC-NIC                                  Page 1 of 3      Created On Sun Feb 21 03:35:19 IST 2016
                    C/AO/2/2016                                          ORDER




         Special Civil Suit No.130 of 2015, Exh.5 was also filed which
         is pending consideration. Since the Exh.5 was pending, filing
         of Exh.18 by the present appellant has led the court to pass an
         order which is under challenge. On filing of application, the
         court has passed an order that in view of Exh.5 application is
         pending for hearing, therefore this application is not allowed
         at this stage.
</p>

<p id="p_6">         6.   Passing of an order - speaking order - on above line, on
         filing of the Exh.18 by the present appellant is not proper, the
         Court may have kept Exh.18 for hearing along with Exh.5.
         Passing of an order on mere tendering of application is bad.
</p>

<p id="p_7">         7.   Be that as it may. The order passed below Exh.18 dated
         5.12.2015 is hereby quashed and set aside. The trial court is
         directed to decide Exh.5 and Exh.18 applications on merits.
</p>

<p id="p_8">         8.   It appears that above Special Civil Suit No.130 of 2015
         is pending before the learned 2nd Additional Senior Civil
         Judge, Anand. The learned Principal District Judge, Anand is
         requested to transfer the Special Civil Suit No.130 of 2015 to
         any other Senior Civil Judge. This order of transfer is passed
         in the facts of the present case and it has no reflection on the
         conducting of the case or working by the learned Additional
         Senior Civil Judge.
</p>

<p id="p_9">         9.   Learned advocate for the respondent has pointed out
         that huge arrears of respondent is pending since long and
         therefore, time bound direction be given for disposal of the
         interim relief applications. Learned advocate for the appellant
         agrees to cooperate the court in expeditious disposal of

         interim relief applications. The trial court shall decide interim
         relief applications within 8 weeks from the date of receipt of
         writ of this Court by the concerned court.
</p>

<p id="p_10">         10.     Brief submissions were made by learned advocates for
         the parties on facts. However, this Court has not gone into the
         merits of the matter and the trial court shall decide the
         interim relief applications on its own merits without being
         influenced in any way by the present order.

         extent. Direct service is permitted.
