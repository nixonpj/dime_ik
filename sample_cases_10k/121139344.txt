      This appeal coming on for admission this day,

                       JUDGMENT
</pre>

<p id="p_1">      Appellants are the Ex-Directors of M/s.Kavitha

Tubes Limited. Being aggrieved by the order dated 15th

February 2012 made         in C.A.No.25/2008       in Co.P

No.199/2000 passed by the Company Judge, fixing the

liability   on   the   appellants   to   pay   a   sum   of

Rs.27,41,094/- with interest at the rate of 18% p.a.,

they have filed this appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">2.    On filing of Co.P 199/2000 by M/s. Raymond

Limited under <a href="/doc/1901728/" id="a_2">Section 433(e)</a> of the Companies Act,

1956 for winding up of M/s. Kavitha Tubes Limited, the

Company Court by its order dated 17th January 2003

allowed the said company petition and directed to wind

up the said M/s. Kavitha Tubes Limited and the Official
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                 4</span>


Liquidator was directed to take charge of all the

properties and assets of the said company. Pursuant to

the winding up order passed by the Company Court, the

Official Liquidator attached to this Court took over the

assets of the said Company.           The Ex-Directors of the

said Company were required to file a statement of

affairs, so as to enable the Official Liquidator to take

note of realizable assets and apply the same in

liquidation proceedings.
</p>
<p id="p_4">
</p><pre id="pre_2">3.   In     pursuance      of        the   order     made       in

C.A.No.783/2003      and    C.A.No.784/2004,           the     Ex-

Directors   had   filed   the       statement   of   affairs   on

</pre><p id="p_5">8-10-2003 and 26-3-2004. However, the statement of

affairs was incomplete. The annual returns pertaining

to the balance sheet of the company in liquidation as on

31-3-2002 was filed. The Official Liquidator had noticed

the transaction of Rs.27,41,195/- from the balance

sheet towards sundry debtors, loans and advances, and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                 5</span>


cash and bank balance. However, the appellants who

are erstwhile Directors of the Company did not furnish

any further details with regard to the said entries in the

annual returns so as to enable the Official Liquidator to

take steps for recovery of the amount from the sundry

debtors and also the loans which were recoverable.            In

view of that the Official Liquidator filed an application in

C.A.No.25/2008 under <a href="/doc/950134/" id="a_3">Section 543(1)</a> of the Companies

Act read with Rule 260 of Company (Court) Rules 1959

and initiated misfeasance proceedings against the Ex.-

Directors of the Company.            Pursuant to the notice

issued by the Company Court, the appellants entered

appearance, however, no statement of objection has

been filed to the said application.
</p>
<p id="p_6">
</p><p id="p_7">4.    On   behalf    of   the       Official   Liquidator,   one

Sri.Vasanth Kumar was examined and got marked the

annual returns as Ex.P1. However, the appellants have

not cross-examined the said witness and not disputed
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                             6</span>


the claim made in C.A.No.25/2008.         The Company

Court after examining the matter, allowed the said

application on 15th February 2012, and a decree has

been drawn for a sum of Rs.27,41,094/- with interest at

the rate of 18% p.a. against the appellants jointly and

severally.   Being aggrieved by the said order, the

appellants have preferred this appeal.


</p><p id="p_8">5.    Sri.K.Chandrasekhar, learned counsel appearing

for the appellants contended that the order passed by

the Company Court in C.A.No.25/2008 is contrary to

law. The Company Court failed to notice that the books

of accounts were with the Official Liquidator and the

break-up for the amount of Rs.27,41,090/- has not

been set out and the same could not form the basis for

grant of relief prayed in the application. The appellants

are not liable to make good the said amount. When the

company had been wound up and all the assets and

liabilities are taken over by the Official Liquidator, the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                              7</span>


question of appellants recovering the said amount from

the debtors does not arise and sought for allowing the

appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_9">
</p><p id="p_10">6.   On the other hand, Sri.V.Jayaram, the learned

counsel appearing for the Official Liquidator argued in

support of the order passed by the Company Court and

contended that inspite of sufficient opportunity given to

the appellants to produce necessary documents, they

have failed to do so.     The balance sheet, prior to the

liquidation    of   the   company    clearly   disclose   the

transaction towards sundry debtors amounting to

Rs.19,09,243/-,      Rs.8,20,179/-   towards    loans     and

advances and Rs.11,773/- towards cash in bank

balance.      However, no further particulars had been

furnished. Accordingly, action had been taken invoking

<a href="/doc/1030396/" id="a_4">Section 543</a> of the Act. Hence, sought for dismissal of

the appeal.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                             8</span><p id="p_11">


</p><p id="p_12">7.   We have carefully considered the arguments

addressed by the learned counsel for the parties.


</p><p id="p_13">8.   The records clearly disclose that M/s. Kavitha

Tubes Limited was ordered to be wound up by this

Court by an order dated 17th January 2003, and the

Official Liquidator took over the assets of the said

Company.      Immediately after winding up          of the

company, the Ex-Directors were required to file the

statement of affairs so as to enable the Official

Liquidator to realize the assets and apply the same in

the liquidation proceedings.    Inspite of the directions

issued by the Company Court in C.A.No.783/2004 and

C.A.No.784/2004 no statement of affairs has been filed.

The particulars have not been furnished before the

Official Liquidator in respect of the transaction of a sum

of Rs.27,41,094/-. Accordingly, action has been taken

invoking <a href="/doc/1030396/" id="a_5">Section 543</a> of the Companies Act. Though the

notice under <a href="/doc/950134/" id="a_6">Section 543(1)</a> was served, the appellants
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                            9</span>


have not filed any statement of objections despite

engaging the services of an advocate. They have failed

to cross-examine the witnesses examined on behalf of

the Official Liquidator.   The balance Sheet dated

31-03-2002 clearly indicates the amount outstanding,

however the appellants being the erstwhile directors

have not cooperated in recovering the same from the

persons who are actually responsible for the same. The

Company Court after taking into consideration the

entire aspect of the matter, passed the order impugned

in the appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_14">
</p><p id="p_15">9.   We find no infirmity or irregularity in the said

order. The appellants, who are the erstwhile Directors

of the Company did not controvert the balance sheet

dated 31-3-2002.    Further, they have not filed any

objections to the Company Application No.25/2008.

The appellants have not made out a case to interfere

with the order passed by the Company Court in an
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                          10</span>


intra-court   appeal.   Accordingly,   the   appeal   is

dismissed.
