                    statements of most of the prosecution witnesses have been recorded before
                    the trial court and they have not supported the case of the prosecution.

</p><p id="p_8">                           Appellants' three appeals have already been rejected, out of which
                    Cr.A No.1767/2019 and Cr. A. No.5246/2019 were dismissed on merits,
                    vide order dated 2.4.2019 and 22.07.2019, while Cr.A. No.3975/2019 was

                    second and third appeals were rejected after examination of above said
                    witnesses. Thereafter, no material change has taken place.

                    other witnesses, I am of the considered view that it is not a fit case to
                    enlarge the appellant on regular bail. Consequently, this appeal for regular
                    bail under <a href="/doc/50707649/" id="a_10">Section 14-A</a> of the Scheduled Castes and <a href="/doc/25085007/" id="a_11">Scheduled Tribes
                    (Prevention of Atrocities) Act</a>, 1989, filed on behalf of the appellant, deserves
                    to be and is accordingly dismissed.
