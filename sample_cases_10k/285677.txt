<p id="p_1">The

	conviction and sentence  dated 21.7.1997 passed by the learned
	Special Judge, Banaskantha at Palanpur, in Special Case No. 17 of
	1989, whereby, the learned Judge has held the appellant -
	accused guilty for the offences under <a href="/doc/107341/" id="a_1">Sections 161</a> and <a href="/doc/107341/" id="a_2">301</a> of I.P.

	and to pay a fine of Rs.100/- i/d to undergo SI for 3 (three)
	months. The learned Judge has ordered that the sentences shall run
	concurrently. 
</p>	
	 



 

<p id="p_2">2.	The
brief facts of the prosecution case is as under:
</p> 

 


 
	 

<p id="p_3">It
	is the case of the prosecution that the complainant is an
	agriculturist. It is alleged that for doing the agriculture work in
	winter season he required to complete the papers for obtaining the
	loan from the Government, through State Bank of India and,
	therefore, he approached the Talati (accused-appellant herein) and
	asked for copies of village form 7x12 and form 8  from him. It is
	alleged that for preparing the said documents, the accused has
	demanded Rs.500/- from the complainant. The complainant has
	requested to reduce the said amount, however, the appellant did not
	consider the request for reducing the amount. It is alleged that
	Rs.300/- was required to be paid by the complainant to the accused
	at the time of preparing the papers and the remaining amount of
	Rs.200/- was to be paid after the loan was sanctioned. It is alleged
	that on 22.9.1987 the complainant had gone to the house of accused
	and asked for the papers. The accused told him that the papers are
	ready and demanded Rs.300/-., and thereupon the complainant told him
	that he will pay the amount tomorrow i.e. on the next day.
	Thereafter, the complainant approached the A.C.B. Office at Palanpur
	and met P.I. Mr. Gohil. The complaint was lodged and two panchas
	were called. Thereafter, the  currency notes were smeared with
	anthracene powder,  experiment of ultra violet lamp was carried out
	in the A.C.B. Office in presence of two panchas and the complainant
	and they were made to understand about the trap. Thereafter, the
	raiding party, complainant and the panchas have proceeded to Deodar
	and as per pre-arrangement the complainant and Panch have gone to
	the house of the accused. It is alleged that the complainant has
	asked for the papers from the accused. The accused had handed over
	the papers and obtained Rs.300/-  in presence of panch No.1.
	Thereafter, the complainant had called the raiding party. They made
	search from the accused and also in the house of the accused, but,
	the amount could not be found out. The raiding party has seized the
	copy of 7x12 extract and form No.8(A) from the complainant which was
	given by the accused. Experiment of ultra-violet lamp was done on
	the person of the accused where on the cloths  and on the finger tip
	of the accused, anthracene powder was found.  Thereafter, the 
	panchnama was carried out in presence of panchas.  
</p>	
	 


	  

<p id="p_4">Thereafter,
	the complaint was registered against the appellant. Statement of the
	complainant and other witnesses were recorded. Necessary sanction
	was obtained from the concerned Authority and after the
	investigation was over the charge-sheet was filed against the
	appellant under <a href="/doc/107341/" id="a_9">Section 161</a> and <a href="/doc/107341/" id="a_10">201</a> of I.P. Code and under <a href="/doc/1205978/" id="a_11">Section
	5(1)(g)</a> read with <a href="/doc/1205978/" id="a_12">Section 5(2)</a> of the Act.  
</p>	
	 


	  

<p id="p_5">Thereafter,
	the charge was framed against the appellant. The appellant -
	accused has pleaded not guilty to the charge and claimed to be
	tried.
</p>	 


	  

<p id="p_6">In
	order to bring home the charge levelled against the appellant-
	accused, the prosecution has examined the witnesses and also relied
	upon the documentary evidence. 
</p>	
	 


	  

<p id="p_7">Thereafter,
	after examining the witnesses, further statement of the
	appellant-accused under sec. 313 of Cr PC was recorded in which the
	appellant-accused has denied the case of the prosecution. The
	appellant - accused filed his written statement vide Exh.49.
	It is mentioned in the said statement that before the incident the
	complainant had approached him and asked for copies of revenue
	record and at that time, after seeing the record, it was told to the
	complainant that he should pay the dues which are pending in the
	name of his grand father and uncle and then he can take the papers,
	It is also stated that every month the meeting of Talatis are held
	in the office of Taluka Development Officer and they are instructed
	that if anybody comes for copy of revenue record, they shall insist
	to recover the pending dues. Therefore, the accused has demanded the
	amount towards pending dues from the complainant.  It is also stated
	in the statement that on the date of incident, the accused was in
	his house and along with him, other four persons were there and at
	that time only the complainant came and informed him that he has
	brought the pending dues and asked for the papers and, therefore, he
	had gone in the house and brought the papers and receipt book with
	him and gave the papers to the complainant and thereafter the
	complainant gave Rs.300/- to him. The accused has, therefore, told
	the complainant that the dues are more than that he has paid and
	thereupon the complainant told him that he will pay the remaining
	afterwards. Thereupon he returned back the papers from the
	complainant and put them in the pocket of the pant. Thereafter, the
	complainant had gone out of his house and after some time he came
	with raiding party. The amount was not found from his person  or
	from his house. Thereafter, he was taken to the Deodar Rest House
	and then prepared the documents and false case has been filed
	against him. The accused has also examined witness (DW - 1)
	Dhanjibhai Mafatbhai Atecha Exh. 51. 
</p>	
	 


	  

<p id="p_8">After
	considering the oral as well as documentary evidence and after
	hearing the parties, learned Judge vide impugned judgment and order
	dated 24.07.1997 held the appellant - accused guilty to the
	charge levelled against him and convicted and sentenced the
	appellant accused, as stated above.
</p>	 


	  

<p id="p_9">Being
	aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the impugned judgment and order
	of conviction and sentence passed by the learned Special Judge,
	Palanpur, the present appellant has preferred this appeal.
</p>	 


	  

<p id="p_10">Heard
	Mr. Y.S. Lakhani, learned Senior Advocate for the appellant and Mr
	R.C. Kodekar, learned APP for the respondent-State.
</p>	 


	  

<p id="p_11">Mr
	Lakhani, learned Counsel, appearing for the appellant has read the
	charge Exh.5 and contended that even from the contents of the
	charge, prima facie, doubt is created from the papers as well as
	from the statement of the witness and the panchnama and the
	complainant himself. He has read the oral evidence of P.W.1 -
	complainant Narsinh Manaji Mali (Exh.9) and contended that this
	witness is a star witness of the prosecution, who has not supported
	the case of the prosecution. Mr. Lakhani has also read the oral
	evidence of P.W.2 - Sagathabhai Virbhanbhai (Exh.15) and
	contended that this witness is an eye witness, who was present at
	the time of alleged incident. He has contended that looking to the
	evidence, this witness has not supported the case of the
	prosecution. Mr. Lakhani has also read the oral evidence of P.W.3 -
	Haribhai Jivabhai Patel (Exh.16) and contended that this witness was
	present at the time of alleged incident. However, the prosecution
	could not get any support from his evidence to prove its case. Mr.
	Lakhani has also read the oral evidence of P.W.4 -
	Ramchandbhai Bhanabhai (Exh.18) and contended that this witness was
	also present at the time of alleged incident. However, this witness
	has also not supported the case of the prosecution. Mr. Lakhani has,
	therefore, contended that though the prosecutions witnesses No.2 to
	4 were present at the time of alleged incident and at that time the
	alleged demand was made by the accused from the complainant, the
	prosecution could not establish its case beyond reasonable doubt to
	prove the case against the appellant. It is not the case of the
	prosecution that they are interested witnesses and, therefore, from
	their evidence the prosecution could not establish its case beyond
	reasonable doubt. He has also read the evidence of PW No.5 -
	Niranjankumar Dalpatram Trivedi (Exh. 19), who was serving as Clerk
	in Administrative Department of Taluka Panchayat. He has stated that
	the concerned officer, who has accorded the sanction has been
	retired from service. He has stated that the PI of ACB, vide letter
	dated 3.2.1988 has obtained sanction. However, in cross examination
	he has categorically deposed that he has no knowledge about the
	papers produced at Exh.20. Mr. Lakhani has, therefore, contended
	that the evidence of this witness would not be helpful to the case
	of prosecution. Mr. Lakhani has thereafter read the oral evidence of
	P.W.6 - virjibhai Parthibhai Chaudhry (Exh.21) and contended
	that this witness was Panch No.2, who was instructed to remain with
	the raiding party. He has contended that this witness was not an eye
	witness to the alleged incident and from this evidence also the
	prosecution could not be able to establish the case against the
	accused. He has contended that even in examination-in-chief also
	this witness has categorically deposed that amount was not recovered
	from the accused and even during the search from his house the
	amount was not found. It is also an admitted fact that when the
	alleged trap amount was given, thereafter the appellant -
	accused had not gone any where, however, the trap amount was not
	found in his possession or even during the search of his house the
	same was not found  and, therefore, where the amount had gone that
	is not clarified by the prosecution. He has also read the contents
	of the panchnama and contended that even from the evidence of Panch
	(P.W.8) (Ex.36) the prosecution has failed to prove the whole
	contents of the panchnama and, therefore, they have no right to say
	that the prosecution has proved its case beyond reasonable doubt. He
	has contended that P.W. 9 Madarji Parthiji (Exh. 42), Head Constable
	in the office of A.C.B., is a formal witness and he is not an eye
	witness. He has also read the evidence of P.W. 11 (Exh.44) -
	Ranjitsinh Laxmansinh Gohil, Trapping Officer. He has admitted in
	his evidence that when they reached just near the house of the
	appellant - accused, at that time, the complainant met and
	conveyed him that everything is now over, but, when he reached the
	house of the appellant, during search, he has not recovered any
	amount from the possession of the accused or even during the search
	of his house, nothing was found. He has contended that the learned
	Judge has only relied upon the oral evidence of P.W.6 (Exh. 21) and
	held the appellant guilty to the charges alleged against him. He has
	contended that it is established law that when the sufficient doubt
	is created by the defence then the accused is entitled for the
	benefit of doubt.  Mr. Lakhani has also relied upon a decision in
	the case of BANARASI DAS v/s STATE OF HARYANA, reported in AIR 2010
	SC 1589 and contended that in absence of proof of demand, the
	prosecution has failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt and
	the Judgment of the trial Court may be quashed and set aside and the
	appellant may be acquitted from the charges alleged against him.
</p>	 


	  

<p id="p_12">As
	against this, Mr Kodekar, learned APP appearing for the respondent -
	State has supported the Judgment and order passed by the learned
	Special Judge. He has contended that the learned Judge has not
	committed any error in holding the appellant guilty of the charges
	levelled against him. He has contended that when the anthracene
	powder was found from the clothes and finger tip of the accused then
	the prosecution has proved its case beyond reasonable doubt. He has
	contended that looking to the evidence of prosecution witnesses and
	the Trapping Officer, the demand and acceptance by the accused is
	proved and, therefore, no interference is called for by this Court
	and probable defence is not established by the present appellant. He
	has contended that the learned Judge has considered each and every
	aspect of the matter and has passed absolutely just and proper.
	Therefore also, the impugned judgment and order of conviction and
	sentence passed by the learned Judge requires to be confirmed.
</p>	 


	  

<p id="p_13">I
	have gone through the impugned judgment and order passed by the
	learned Judge and  oral as well as documentary evidence produced on
	the record. I have read the oral evidence of prosecution
	witness-complainant and also perused the charge framed against the
	appellant. It is pertinent to note that in a case of corruption four
	things are required to be appreciated, viz. (I) initial demand, (ii)
	second demand to be made in presence of Panch, (iii) voluntary
	acceptance and (iv) recovery of amount.
</p>	 


	  

<p id="p_14">From
	the perusal of the oral evidence of P.W.1 Narsinh Manaji Mali, the
	complainant, it is established that the demand and acceptance is not
	proved. The complainant is not reliable witness and his evidence is
	required to be considered as doubtful evidence. From the oral
	evidence of P.W.6 - Panch witness, who is star witness of the
	prosecution, the prosecution has failed to establish that trap
	amount was recovered from the possession of the appellant. No doubt
	from the evidence it is established that the amount was handed over
	to the appellant - accused in his house in presence of
	independent witnesses, examined by the prosecution, however, the
	said amount was not found from the possession of the appellant -
	accused and even during the search of his house also the said amount
	was not found and, therefore, the question is that if the amount was
	accepted by the appellant, then where the amount had gone? None of
	the witnesses nor even the trapping officer could say anything about
	the recovery of amount. No doubt the defence has failed to establish
	the presence of anthracene powder on the cloths and finger tips of
	the accused, but, from the cross examination of the witnesses,
	sufficient dout is created by the defence. In criminal law, when the
	doubt is created, then the benefit of doubt is required to be given
	to the present appellant. 
</p>	
	 


	  

<p id="p_15">Looking
	to the overall evidence of the prosecution witnesses, it is clearly
	established that the appellant has not made any demand from the
	complainant.  Even the panch witness has also not stated that
	whether any demand has been made by the appellant from the
	complainant. The amount, which was alleged to have demanded by the
	appellant - accused, was also not found from the possession of
	the appellant or even during the search of his house also the same
	was not found. Even in the evidence of independent witnesses who
	were present at the time of alleged incident, the prosecution has
	failed to establish that any demand was made by the appellant -
	accused from the complainant.  No doubt, as per the say of the
	prosecution, presence of anthracene powder is found on the clothes
	and finger tips of the appellant, but, whether the said amount was
	demanded by the appellant from the complainant is not established,
	then it is difficult to believe the case of the prosecution. I have
	also perused the statement of the present appellant recorded under
	sec.313 of Code of Criminal Procedure It is established that the
	complainant want to get the benefit of loan from the State
	Government, through State Bank of India, and, therefore, he was in
	need of Revenue record and for that purpose he approached the
	appellant - accused. However, the appellant told him that
	first you clear the outstanding dues of his grand father and uncle
	and then he would get the papers and when the complainant approached
	the appellant - accused with Rs.300/-, the appellant told him
	that amount was more and, therefore, he returned the said amount and
	taken back the papers given to the complainant. Therefore, it is
	difficult to believe as to whether any demand is made by the
	appellant - accused. The appellant was not knowing that the
	amount was smeared with currency powder and, therefore, the
	anthracene powder must have found from the cloths and finger tips of
	the appellant accused, but, it cannot be said that the appellant -
	accused demanded the money as an illegal grantification from the
	complainant.  The probable defence is established by the present
	appellant beyond reasonable doubt. In the latest decision of the
	Supreme Court in the case of  Banarsi Das Vs. State of Haryana,
	reported in AIR 2010 SC 1589, wherein, the Hon'ble Supreme
	Court has observed that mere proof of recovery of bribe money from
	accused not sufficient to prove the offence. Even in the present
	case the demand is not established and the amount was not recovered
	from the possession of the accused. In that view of the matter, I am
	of the opinion that so far as the offence of bribery is concerned,
	the demand, acceptance and recovery of bribe amount is required to
	be proved beyond reasonable doubt.  Therefore, in absence of any
	cogent evidence regarding the demand, acceptance and recovery of
	amount, it is difficult to believe the case of prosecution and
	hence, this appeal deserves to be allowed.

<p id="p_16">In
	the result, this appeal is allowed. The impugned judgment and order
	of conviction and sentence dated 21.07.1997 passed by the learned
	Special Judge &amp; Additional Sessions Judge, Banaskantha at
	Palanpur, in Special Case No. 17 of 1989 is hereby quashed and set
	aside. The appellant-accused is hereby acquitted from all the
	charges levelled against him. Fine, if paid, be refunded to the
	appellant. The appellant-accused is on bail, his bail bonds stands
	discharged. R &amp; P to be sent back to the trial court forthwith.
