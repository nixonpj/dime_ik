              W.P.(S) No. 132 of 2008
Lakshman Das                       ...  ...Petitioner.
                        Versus
The State of Jharkhand &amp; others    ...  ...Respondents
CORAM:      HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE D. N. PATEL
                     ......
</pre><p id="p_1">For the Petitioner   : Mr. Shiv Shankar Kumar
For the State        : Mr. Md. Jalisur Rahman, J.C. to G.P.III
For the Respt. No. 5 : Mr. S. Srivastava
                      ......
</p><p id="p_2">                th
04/ Dated: 27 July, 2009

</p><p id="p_3">1.          Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that
petitioner was appointed as Assistant Teacher in the year, 1972
and he retired on 30th of June, 2007. Learned counsel for the
petitioner submitted that increment was given in the year 1981
and, without giving any notice and without giving any opportunity
of being heard to the petitioner, though last pay scale was received
higher, but, it has been reduced by thoroughly a non-speaking and
ex-parte order, which is at Annexure-2 dated 15th of September,
2007, passed by respondent no. 4 and consequently, petitioner is
under apprehension that his pension will also reduce on the basis
of the reduced pay scale. It is vehemently submitted by the counsel
for the petitioner that the respondents have no power or
jurisdiction or authority to reduce the pay scale without giving an
opportunity of being heard to the petitioner. No civil or criminal
enquiry is pending against the petitioner. Petitioner retired in the
year, 2007 and increment given in the year, 1981 is withdrawn by
the respondents in the year, 2007 and therefore, if a direction is
given to the respondents to give a notice to the petitioner and after
giving an opportunity of being heard to the petitioner, the order
may be passed and that too looking to the judgment delivered by
this Court in the case of The State of Jharkhand &amp; Others Vs.
Padmalochan Kalindi &amp; Another as reported in 2007 (4) JLJR
451(Full Bench) as well as decision rendered by the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in the case of Syed Abdul Qadir and Others Vs
State of Bihar and Others as reported in 2009(3) SCC 475 and a
decision rendered by this Court dated 22nd May, 2009 in WP(S) No.
145 of 2008. Had an opportunity been given to the petitioner of
being heard, all these judgments as well as provision of Rule 202 of
Jharkhand Pension Rules, 2000 would have been brought to the
notice of the respondents.
</p><p id="p_4">2.          I have heard, learned counsel for the respondents, who
has submitted that petitioner was wrongly given increment in the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                              -2-</span>
     year, 1981 and therefore, a decision was taken in the year, 1994 to
     withdraw the increment and its effect has given in the year, 2007,
     after retirement of the present petitioner. Petitioner cannot retain
     the benefit, which was wrongly given to him and therefore, order at
     Annexure-2 has been passed by respondent no. 4.
</p><p id="p_5">     3.          Having heard learned counsel for both the sides and
     looking to the facts and circumstances of the case, I hereby quash
     and set aside the action taken by the respondent no. 4 whereby,
     the pay scale of the present petitioner has been reduced mainly for
     the reason that no notice was given to the petitioner, no hearing
     was given to the petitioner and an increment given in the year
     1981 has been withdrawn in September, 2007 and that too
     unilaterally and without following the principles of natural justice.
     Respondent no. 4 has not given any notice and has abruptly
     arrived at the conclusion that the total emolument of the present
     petitioner is Rs. 6,950/- per month, which is absolutely an
     arbitrary action. No reason has been given in the order at
     Annexure-2 to the memo of the petition. Thus, thoroughly a non-
     speaking order has been passed. Petitioner is also apprehending
     deduction in the pension.
</p><p id="p_6">     4.          In view of these facts, the order at Annexure-2 is
     hereby quashed and set aside and if the respondents want to take
     any action, they can take action, in accordance with law, after
     giving an adequate opportunity of being heard to the petitioner and
     in consonance of the aforesaid judgments.
</p><p id="p_7">     5.          This writ petition is allowed to the aforesaid extent.
