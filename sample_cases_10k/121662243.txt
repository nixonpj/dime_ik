                               RESERVED ON :      JUNE 19, 2019.
                               PRONOUNCED ON:     JUNE 26, 2019.


 JUDGMENT [PER : S. M. MODAK, J.]


 .                 On hearing both the sides and on perusing the record we are

 satisfied that the matter needs to be remanded to the Respondent No.1 -

 Scrutiny Committee. We find that the Committee and the Vigilance Team

 has not conducted proper inquiry vis a vis the documents produced by the

 Petitioner. There is one more reason for remanding the matter back. The

 Petitioner produced certain documents before us. They are not produced

 before the Respondent No.1 - Scrutiny Committee. Its genuineness is not

 tested. It can be tested only by way of vigilance enquiry. So we intend to

 remand the matter back to the Respondent No.1 - Committee.


 2.                The Petitioner produced entry in Kotwali Panji dated 24 th

 April 1931. Tribe 'Mana' is mentioned therein. It pertains to a son

 begotten to one Sitaram. The Committee co-related this document to the

 relationship given in the genealogical tree mentioned in the statement of

 the Petitioner's father dated 10th October 2016. The Respondent No.1 -

                                 3/7                           wp.3033.18.(Judg)



 Committee gave a finding that it is improbable that Sitaram described in

 that entry is nothing but a grand-father of Petitioner as described in the

 genealogical tree. The Respondent No.1 - Committee considered the age

 of Petitioner's father and the date of birth. The Committee also gave

 finding that the relationship in between Sitaram and the Petitioner is not

 proved. We find that the Research Officer has not given an opportunity to

 the Petitioner to show his relationship with Sitaram.


 3.                The Respondent No.1 - Committee also considered two birth

 extracts of the year 1945 and 1947. Daughters by name Chandrabhaga

 and Imali were born to one Sadya Kothya and Madho Vithu. Tribe 'Mana'

 is mentioned therein. The Respondent No.1 - Committee refused to accept

 this document. Petitioner could not proved her relationship with those

 persons. For this kind of document also we feel that the Research Officer

 and Committee has failed to give an opportunity to the Petitioner to show

 the said relationship. Ultimately, father of the Petitioner is a labourer and

 there is a burden cast on the Research Officer and Committee to seek an

 explanation about the relationship, but it has not been done.

 4.                For these shortcomings, we feel that there is great injustice

 caused to the Petitioner. Invalidation of caste certificate has got serious

 consequences. In the set of facts we feel that Petitioner needs to be given

 an opportunity to show her relationship with above mentioned persons.


 5.                There are four entries of Dakhal Kharij Register collected by

 the Vigilance Committee. Tribe 'Kunbi' is mentioned therein. They were

 considered by the Committee so as to invalidate the Petitioner's claim. In

 order to nullify the fact of those documents, Petitioner had filed before us

 copies of four Affidavits/Verifications. It mentions the date of birth and

 concerned persons not taken education. They are certified by the Head

 Master of the concerned school also. Tribe 'Mana/Mani-Kunbi' is

 mentioned therein. These documents are as follows :-

 (a)      The affidavit of Samba s/o Kothiram dated 1/8/57;

 (b)      The affidavit of Sadashiv Kothu dated 1/8/1956;

 (c)      The affidavit of Sadashiv Wakde dated 31/7/59; and

 (d)      The affidavit of Marotrao Wakde dated 1/7/1960.


 Admittedly, they were not produced before the Respondent No.1 -

 Committee. We are not expressing any opinion about these documents.

 6.                The Principal   Bench   of   this   Court      in    the case         of

 Rajendra Ramrao Ghosalkar V/s State of Maharashtra &amp; Ors. in Writ

 Petition No. 4859 of 2000 on 19th &amp; 20th January, 2006 has considered

 the effect of entries made in a school register on one hand and admission

 form filled in at that time on the other hand. The information contained in

 admission form is a primary evidence. The ratio is applicable to a case

 before us. The Affidavits/Verification produced before us is a primary

 document. As they were not produced before the Committee and during

 vigilance enquiry, we are not expressing any comment about its

 genuineness. For this reason also we intend to remand the matter back to

 the Respondent No.1 - Committee.


 7.                As such, we are not making any comment about other issue

 raised about merits of the matter. Because we are convinced that on the

 basis of available materials, certainly direction cannot be given to issue

 validity certificate. There is Civil Application asking for restoration of

 services of Petitioner. We are not intending to pass any orders as matter is

 remanded back and services are already terminated. So, we intend to

 partly allow the Petition and proceed to pass the following order.
