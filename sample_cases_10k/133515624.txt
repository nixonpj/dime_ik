       THIS WRIT PETITION IS F ILED UNDER A RTICLES 226
AND 227 OF THE CONS TITU TION OF INDIA , PRAYING TO
QUASH     THE   IMPUGNED      ORDER   ON    I.A .NO.III,   DA TED
6.8.2014 PASSED BY THE COURT OF PRL.CIVIL JUDGE &amp;
JMFC,     DHARWAD,       IN   O.S .NO.552/2013,     WHICH      IS
PRODUCED AND MARKED A T ANNEXURE-D, ETC.,.

       THIS   PETITION    COMING    ON     FOR    HEARING     ON
INTERLOCU TORY APPLICA TION TH IS DAY, THE COURT MADE
THE FOLLOWING:
                                  3




                             ORDER
</pre>

<p id="p_1">      Though this matter is coming up for consideration

of   application   filed   for   vacating   the   interim   order

granted in favour of the petitioners, with the consent of

both the parties to the proceedings, the same is taken

up for final disposal.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">      2.   The present Writ Petition is filed by plaintiffs

1 to 6 in O.S.No.552/2013, pending on the file of Prl.

Civil Judge (Jr.Dn.) and JMFC, Dharwad.


</p><p id="p_4">      3.   Admittedly, the said suit is filed for the relief

of declaration to declare that the sale deed dated

11.2.2005 registered vide document No.4358/2004-05

and also the sale deed No.4349/2007-08 registered on

22.11.2007 are obtained fraudulently and consequently

to cancel the same. In addition to that the plaintiffs

have also sought for the relief of permanent injunction

against the defendants 1 to 3 who are purchasers of

the property under the aforesaid two sale deeds.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                     4</span>




</p><p id="p_5">     4.        In the said proceedings it is seen that the

written statements are filed on behalf of the contesting

defendants 2 and 3. The 1 s t defendant is said to be the

witness for the sale deeds, which are executed by the

father    of    the   plaintiffs    1    to   6   who    is   no   more.

Admittedly the transactions have taken place in the

year 2005 and 2007. The suit is filed in the year 2013

seeking    declaration      that        the   said    sale    deeds   are

obtained fraudulently. In the said suit an application

in I.A.No.3 is filed by the plaintiff under Order 11 Rule

14 read with Section 151 of Code of Civil Procedure,

seeking direction to 2 n d and 3 r d defendants to produce

original sale deeds dated 22.11.2007 and 11.2.2005 in

the suit for the reasons that the said documents are

required to be placed before the Court for the purpose

of declaring them as fraudulent documents.


</p><p id="p_6">     5.        It is seen that the Court below on going

through        the    application       and    also     the    pleadings

available on record has rejected the same by its order
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                 5</span>




dated     6.8.2014.   Being   aggrieved   by    the   same,   the

present writ petition is filed to impugn the order dated

6.8.2014.
</p>
<p id="p_7">
</p><p id="p_8">     6.     Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners,

who are plaintiffs 1 to 6 in the O.S.No.552/2013 and

also the respondents 2 and 3 who are defendants 2

and 3 in the said suit, perused the order impugned and

the other material available on record.


</p><p id="p_9">     7.     On going through the same, it is seen that

the reason assigned by the learned trial Judge in

dismissing the application in I.A.No.3 appears to be

just and proper for the reason that the certified copy of

the impugned documents are already on record as they

are produced by the plaintiffs at the time of filing of

the suit. Therefore question of seeking production of its

original    from   defendants   2   and   3    is   nothing   but

harassment to the defendants.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                   6</span><p id="p_10">




</p><p id="p_11">        8.    In that view of the matter, this Court find no

justifiable grounds are made out to interfere with the

order dated 6.8.2014 in rejecting the application in

I.A.No.3 filed by the plaintiffs in O.S.No.552/2013.

Accordingly this writ petition is dismissed.


</p><p id="p_12">        9.    Considering the fact that this is a fraudulent

litigation, this Court finds that mere dismissal is not

sufficient.      Therefore   while    dismissing   this   petition

sufficient cost is also required to be imposed to curb

this kind of practice. Hence while dismissing the writ

petition     a   cost   of   Rs.3,000/-   is   imposed    on   the

petitioners, which they are required to deposit in the

Court below. The further proceedings in the suit shall

be subject to deposit of cost. As and when the cost is

deposited, the same shall be released in favour of

defendants 2 and 3 at the rate of Rs.1,500/- each to

meet the cost of litigation.
