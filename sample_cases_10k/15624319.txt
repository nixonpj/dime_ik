    well as this Court that freedom of an individual cannot be





    curtailed for indefinite period, especially when his/her guilt is yet

    to be proved, in accordance with law.
</p>

<p id="p_9">    6.          Recently, the Hon'ble Apex Court in Criminal Appeal

    No. 227/<a href="/doc/122663958/" id="a_5">2018, Dataram Singh vs. State of Uttar Pradesh &amp;



    Anr</a> decided on 6.2.2018 has categorically held that freedom of

    an individual is of utmost importance and same cannot be




    curtailed merely on the basis of suspicion. Hon'ble Apex Court





    has further held that till the time guilt of accused is not proved,





    in accordance with law, he is deemed to be innocent. The

    relevant paras No.2 to 5 of the judgment are reproduced as

    under:­

</p><p id="p_10">                    2. A fundamental postulate of criminal
                    jurisprudence is the presumption of innocence,
                    meaning thereby that a person is believed to be
                    innocent until found guilty. However, there are




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                             ::: Downloaded on - 29/09/2019 03:04:34 :::HCHP</span>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                         4</span>



        instances in our criminal law where a reverse
        onus has been placed on an accused with regard
        to some specific offences but that is another
        matter and does not detract from the




                                                   .
</p><p id="p_11">        fundamental postulate in respect of other





        offences. Yet another important facet of our
        criminal jurisprudence is that the grant of bail is
        the general rule and putting a person in jail or in





        a prison or in a correction home (whichever
        expression one may wish to use) is an exception.
        Unfortunately, some of these basic principles
        appear to have been lost sight of with the result





        that more and more persons are being
        incarcerated and for longer periods. This does
        not do any good to our criminal jurisprudence or
        to our society.
</p>
<p id="p_12">        3. There is no doubt that the grant or denial of

        bail is entirely the discretion of the judge
        considering a case but even so, the exercise of
        judicial discretion has been circumscribed by a
        large number of decisions rendered by this Court


        and by every High Court in the country. Yet,
        occasionally there is a necessity to introspect
        whether denying bail to an accused person is the
        right thing to do on the facts and in the




        circumstances of a case.
</p><p id="p_13">        4. While so introspecting, among the factors that





        need to be considered is whether the accused was
        arrested during investigations when that person





        perhaps has the best opportunity to tamper with
        the evidence or influence witnesses. If the
        investigating officer does not find it necessary to
        arrest an accused person during investigations, a
        strong case should be made out for placing that
        person in judicial custody after a charge sheet is
        filed. Similarly, it is important to ascertain
        whether the accused was participating in the
        investigations to the satisfaction of the
        investigating officer and was not absconding or
        not    appearing     when     required    by    the




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                ::: Downloaded on - 29/09/2019 03:04:34 :::HCHP</span>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                     5</span>



                    investigating officer. Surely, if an accused is not
                    hiding from the investigating officer or is hiding
                    due to some genuine and expressed fear of being
                    victimised, it would be a factor that a judge




                                                               .
</p><p id="p_14">                    would need to consider in an appropriate case. It





                    is also necessary for the judge to consider whether
                    the accused is a first­time offender or has been
                    accused of other offences and if so, the nature of





                    such offences and his or her general conduct. The
                    poverty or the deemed indigent status of an
                    accused is also an extremely important factor
                    and even Parliament has taken notice of it by





                    incorporating an Explanation to <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_6">Section 436</a> of
                    the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. An equally
                    soft approach to incarceration has been taken by
                    Parliament by inserting <a href="/doc/50707649/" id="a_7">Section 436A</a> in<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_8"> the

                    Code</a> of Criminal Procedure, 1973.
</p>
<p id="p_15">                    5. To put it shortly, a humane attitude is required
                    to be adopted by a judge, while dealing with an
                    application for remanding a suspect or an
                    accused person to police custody or judicial


                    custody. There are several reasons for this
                    including maintaining the dignity of an accused
                    person, howsoever poor that person might be, the
                    requirements of <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_9">Article 21</a> of the Constitution and




                    the fact that there is enormous overcrowding in
                    prisons, leading to social and other problems as





                    noticed by this Court in In Re­Inhuman
                    Conditions in 1382 Prisons





</p><p id="p_16">    7.         Needless to say object of the bail is to secure the

    attendance of the accused in the trial and the proper test to be

    applied in the solution of the question whether bail should be

    granted or refused is whether it is probable that the party will

    appear to take his trial. Otherwise, bail is not to be withheld as




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                            ::: Downloaded on - 29/09/2019 03:04:34 :::HCHP</span>

    a punishment. Otherwise also, normal rule is of bail and not jail.
</p>
<p id="p_17">    Court has to keep in mind nature of accusations, nature of




                                                                 .
</p><p id="p_18">    evidence in support thereof, severity of the punishment which





    conviction will entail, character of the accused, circumstances





    which are peculiar to the accused involved in that crime.
</p>
<p id="p_19">    8.         The Hon'ble Apex Court in Sanjay Chandra versus





    Central Bureau of Investigation (2012)1 Supreme Court

    Cases 49; held as under:­


                " The object of bail is to secure the appearance of
               the accused person at his trial by reasonable amount
               of bail. The object of bail is neither punitive nor
               preventative. Deprivation of liberty must be
               considered a punishment, unless it can be required



               to ensure that an accused person will stand his trial
               when called upon. The Courts owe more than verbal
               respect to the principle that punishment begins after




               conviction, and that every man is deemed to be
               innocent until duly tried and duly found guilty.
</p>




<p id="p_20">               Detention in custody pending completion of trial
               could be a cause of great hardship. From time to
               time, necessity demands that some unconvicted





               persons should be held in custody pending trial to
               secure their attendance at the trial but in such
               cases, "necessity" is the operative test. In India , it
               would be quite contrary to the concept of personal
               liberty enshrined in the Constitution that any person
               should be punished in respect of any matter, upon
               which, he has not been convicted or that in any
               circumstances, he should be deprived of his liberty
               upon only the belief that he will tamper with the
               witnesses    if left at liberty, save in the most
               extraordinary circumstances. Apart from the
               question of prevention being the object of refusal of

                   bail, one must not lose sight of the fact that any
                   imprisonment before conviction has a substantial
                   punitive content and it would be improper for any
                   court to refuse bail as a mark of disapproval of




                                                                  .
