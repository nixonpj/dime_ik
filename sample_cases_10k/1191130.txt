              Dated, this the 6th day of August, 2010

                            J U D G M E N T

<p id="p_1">      Challenge in the writ petition is against Ext.P4, a vacancy

notification issued by the respondent Company inviting applications

for the post of Worker.
</p>
<p id="p_2">      2.   According to the petitioners, prescriptions in Ext.P4

notification are contrary to Exts.P1 &amp; P3 Government Orders, and it

is on that basis, the petitioners seek to challenge Ext.P4 notification.

One of the main contentions raised by the petitioners is regarding

the inclusion of Ex-Apprentices among the four categories eligible

to apply in terms of Ext.P4 notification. It is contended that Ex-

Apprentices are not included as an eligible category in Exts.P1 &amp; P3

Government Orders and therefore, the respondent Company could

not have included Ex-Apprentices also among the eligible

categories.
</p>
<p id="p_3">      3.   First of all, Exts.P1 &amp; P3 Government Orders only provide

for certain preferences to persons evicted from the project site,

persons whose land has been acquired for project site and persons

belonging to the surrounding Panchayats to the project, who have

WP(C) No.24752/2010
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                    -2-</span>

been working at the project site of the Company. A reading of Ext.P1

order itself show that preference will be given provided, other things

being equal. This obviously means that if the applicants belonging to

the aforesaid three categories come out equal to the applicants

belonging to other categories, the categories of persons mentioned

in Exts.P1 &amp; P3 orders will be preferred over the other categories.

Necessarily therefore, Exts.P1 &amp; P3 do not rule out the freedom of the

Company to include other categories also as eligible category, as and

when notification is issued and selection is held. Therefore, if the

respondent Company in its wisdom has decided to include Ex-

Apprentices of the Company also as an eligible category, in my view,

neither Ext.P1 nor Ext.P3 will stand in its way.

</p><p id="p_4">      4.    Yet another contention raised by the learned counsel for

the petitioners is that in Ext.P4, it is provided that a minimum

attendance of 100 days is necessary and that in Ext.P3 Government

Order, it is provided that those who have attained experience of 1

year or minimum attendance of 100 days will be eligible. It is stated

in Ext.P4 notification that only those who are having minimum 100

days attendance are made eligible and therefore to that extent Ext.P4

notification is contrary to Exts.P1 &amp; P3.
</p>
<p id="p_5">      5.    True as contended, in Ext.P3 Government Order it is

WP(C) No.24752/2010
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                    -3-</span>

provided that those who are having 1 year experience or having 100

days minimum attendance will be eligible. It is also true that in

Ext.P4, those who are having 1 year experience is not seen included.

However, in my understanding, by confining the eligibility to those

who are having 100 days minimum attendance, the Company was

making only a liberal provision to the advantage of the candidates, in

as much as by this prescription the Company has made candidates

having attendance of 100 days also eligible as against the one year

prescribed in Ext.P3. This does not cause any prejudice to any one of

the applicants.    Therefore, this contention also does not call for

interference.
</p>
<p id="p_6">      Learned counsel for the petitioners then contended that in

Ext.P4 notification, persons belonging to surrounding Panchayats,

who have been working at the project sites of the respondent

Company are not made as an eligible category of applicants.

However, going by the pleadings in the writ petition itself, by virtue

of the exclusion of the said category, the petitioners did not suffer

any prejudice and therefore, I am not persuaded to entertain the writ

petition on that plea either.
</p>
<p id="p_7">      The writ petition fails and is accordingly dismissed.
