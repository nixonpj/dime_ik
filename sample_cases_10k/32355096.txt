</pre><p id="p_1">                               DATE : 16th September, 2019.
</p>
<p id="p_2">                                            Heard.
</p><p id="p_3">                                            It appears that the respondent No.2 Joint
                               Director of Higher Education, Nagpur Division, Nagpur is
                               functioning as dual capacity in the present case. While
                               functioning as Joint Director, the respondent No.2 is also
                               functioning as Administrator of respondent No.3 College.
                               So, if any proposal has not been received by the Joint
                               Director, it is the Joint Director only who has to take
                               necessary steps as early as possible. The respondent No.2
                               in the reply filed on 26th July, 2019 has stated that as there
                               was an interse dispute between the Principal and one
                               faction of the management, some papers relating to service
                               of the petitioner were not made available to him and that
                               she would require some more time to trace out those
                               papers.   However, today, nothing futher regarding the
                               efforts taken by the respondent No.3 to trace out the
                               papers has been stated. From the side of the petitioner, it

 wp5031.18.odt                                                                              2/2



                             appears that necessary co-operation has been rendered so
                             far by the petitioner in order to recreate the lost
                             documents. Learned counsel for the petitioner has placed
                             on record a letter marked 'X' for identification sent by him
                             to the respondent No.2. It states that the service book and
                             the concerned proposal is available at the establishment
                             department of the College and, therefore, it is not possible
                             for him to give a copy thereof to the respondent No.2.
                             Usually, a duplicate service book is provided to an
                             employee and in the present case, petitioner does not say
                             anything about his having been furnished a copy of the
                             service book. He also does not clarify if at any point of
                             time he had demanded copy of the service book from the
                             management of the College. Now, if the service book is
                             not available and petitioner is also unaware of the service
                             book, we do not think that inbroglio that has now
                             developed can be resolved. The petitioner also does not
                             say anything about his willingness to co-operate with the
                             respondent No.2 for re-creation of his service book by
                             furnishing copies of whatever relevant documents he has.
                             It would be necessary for the petitioner to give a
                             thoughtful consideration also to this aspect of the matter,
                             failing which it would not be possible for this Court to
                             allow this petition.
