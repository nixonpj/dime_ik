</pre>

<p id="p_1">K. Ramakrishnan, J

           This is an application filed by the petitioner in

O.P.No.502/2013 challenging Ext.P5 order passed in

I.A.No.3039/2013.
</p>
<p id="p_2">           2.      That application was filed by the first

respondent herein to represent him through power of

attorney and that petition was allowed. That order is being

challenged by the petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_3">           3.      Heard the counsel for the petitioner and

respondents.
</p>
<p id="p_4">           4.      The grievance of the petitioner was that, if

the first respondent is permitted to appear through power

of attorney holder, he will not enter appearance personally

so as to satisfy the mandatory provisions of counseling

proceedings as provided under the <a href="/doc/373687/" id="a_1">Family Court Act</a> and

O.P.(F.C.) No. 87 of 2014
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                   2</span>

Rules and that will only prolong the matter.

</p><p id="p_5">              5.     The counsel for the respondents submitted

that, whenever the presence of the first respondent is

required, he is ready to appear.
</p>
<p id="p_6">              6.     There is no provision in the <a href="/doc/373687/" id="a_2">Family Court Act</a>

which prevents a party from appearing through power of

attorney holder. This was supported by the decision of this

court in <a href="/doc/17989678/" id="a_3">Mukundan Naveen v. Anjalika Dinesh</a> (2011(3)

KLT 175). But, it may not be possible for the power of

attorney holder to give evidence regarding personal matters

known between the parties alone. So permitting the party to

the proceedings to appear through power of attorney holder

cannot be said to be an illegal order passed by the court

below. So there is no illegality committed by the court

below in allowing the application, permitting the first

respondent to be represented through the 2nd respondent

herein, who is none other than his mother on the basis of

the power of attorney executed by him, but this will not

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                    3</span>

prevent the Family Court to insist for the presence of the

first respondent before the court, whenever his presence is

required for the purpose of sending the parties to

counseling or for other purposes to explore the possibility of

settlement. If the court feels that, his presence is required,

then the court can insist for his presence and if such an

order is passed, the first respondent is bound to appear

before the court below in compliance with that order.
