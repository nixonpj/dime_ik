Judgment on:          21.04.2009


INDIRA BANERJEE, J.:         In this writ petition, the petitioner has inter alia sought orders

on the respondent No.7, being the Secretary of the Managing Committee of Teor K.A,

Higher Secondary School, hereinafter referred to as the school, to allow the petitioner to

resume his duties as Headmaster and to release the monthly salary of the petitioner with

effect from 24 th October, 2007 and other reliefs.
</p>
<p id="p_2">

</p><p id="p_3">            The petitioner was appointed Headmaster of the school with effect

from 12 th January, 1997. By a letter of suspension dated 19 th July, 2006,

the petitioner was suspended from service.               A charge-sheet was issued to
 the petitioner.     It is alleged that supporting documents which formed the

basis of the charges levelled against the petitioner were not furnished with

the charge-sheet and no list of witnesses were supplied.



</p><p id="p_4">          The petitioner preferred an appeal being Appeal No.19 of 2006

before the Appeal Committee of the West Bengal Board of Secondary

Education, hereinafter referred to as the Board.                     While the appeal was

pending, the Board approved the suspension of the petitioner.



</p><p id="p_5">          A writ petition filed by the petitioner in this Court, being W.P.

No.2900 (W) of 2007 was disposed of by an order dated 22 nd February, 2007

whereby the Appeal Committee of the Board was directed to consider and

dispose of the appeal of the petitioner within six weeks from the date of

communication of the said order.
</p>
<p id="p_6">

</p><p id="p_7">          The appeal was heard on 24 th April, 2007.        According to the respondents no

order was passed in the presence of the parties.      An order dated 24 th April, 2007 was

communicated to the respective parties under cover of a letter dated 22 nd June, 2007

which was received by the petitioner on 25 th June, 2007.



</p><p id="p_8">          The Appeal Committee directed the Managing Committee to take all appropriate

steps including appointment of Enquiry Officer keeping in view the time frame and stages

mentioned   in   circular   being   Memo   No.S/182   dated   6 th   November,   2006   and   to

communicate the final decision to the petitioner as early as possible but within six

months from the date of communication of the said order.
</p><p id="p_9">           Mr. Sadananda Ganguly, appearing on behalf of the petitioner submitted that

the disciplinary proceedings were not concluded within six months from the date of

communication of the order of the Appeal Committee.     The disciplinary proceedings had

thus become vitiated by reason of non-compliance of the mandatory order of the Appeal

Committee.    The petitioner was liable to be reinstated with arrears of salary and

allowances.
</p>
<p id="p_10">

</p><p id="p_11">          Mr. Milan Bhattacharya appearing on behalf of the respondents rightly

submitted that the school authorities were required to comply with the order of the Appeal

Committee within six months from the date of communication of the order.



</p><p id="p_12">          A perusal of the Affidavit-in-Opposition affirmed on behalf of the respondents

indicates that disciplinary proceedings were concluded within six months from the date of

communication of the order of the Appeal Committee.
</p>
<p id="p_13">

</p><p id="p_14">          It is stated that the order of the Appeal Committee was communicated on 25 th

June, 2007. The Headmaster of Hili High School was appointed as Enquiry Officer and a

retired Headmaster of Bandel High School was appointed Presenting Officer.



</p><p id="p_15">          The writ petitioner appeared before the Enquiry Officer.    The Enquiry Officer

concluded the disciplinary proceedings and submitted his report to the Secretary of the

Managing Committee on 24 th November, 2007. The Enquiry Report was placed before the

Managing Committee on 4 th December, 2007 and a resolution was adopted pursuant to

which a second show cause notice was issued to the petitioner.       The said show cause

notice was, according to the petitioners, issued on 13 th December, 2007 and received by

the writ petitioner on 14 th December, 2007.
</p><p id="p_16">           The respondents contend that under cover of a letter dated 26 th December,

2007, the entire proceedings have been forwarded to the respondent Board.



</p><p id="p_17">          Any disciplinary action is subject to approval of the Board.     For delay on the

part of the Board to take a decision, an employee found guilty in enquiry, cannot be

directed to be reinstated.    This Court, might at best, direct the Board to take an

expeditious decision in the matter. In any case, even if any disciplinary action is actually

taken against the writ petitioner, the writ petitioner would have a remedy by way of an

appeal before the Appeal Committee.
</p>
<p id="p_18">

</p><p id="p_19">          The interference of the Writ Court is not warranted at this stage.            The

respondent Board is, however, directed to take an expeditious decision in relation to the

disciplinary action proposed against the writ petitioner.



</p><p id="p_20">          The writ petition is disposed of accordingly.
</p>
<p id="p_21">

          Urgent xerox certified copy of this judgment and order, if applied for, be

supplied to the Advocates-on-Record appearing for the parties, subject to compliance with

the requisite formalities.
</p>
<p id="p_22">


</p><p id="p_23">                                                              (Indira Banerjee, J.)
