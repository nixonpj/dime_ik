                      No. 2197 of 2017 on the file of the first respondent police as against

                      these petitioners.

<p id="p_2">                            2.The learned Counsel appearing for the petitioners would

                      submit that the petitioners are innocent persons and they have not

                      committed any offence as alleged by the prosecution. Without any

                      base, the first respondent police registered a case in Crime No. 2197

                      of 2017 for the offences under <a href="/doc/1198799/" id="a_2">Sections 294(b)</a>, <a href="/doc/1011035/" id="a_3">323</a>,<a href="/doc/724142/" id="a_4">324</a> and <a href="/doc/180217/" id="a_5">506(i)</a>

                      I.P.C. as against the petitioners. Hence he prayed to quash the same.

<p id="p_3">                            3.The learned Government Advocate (criminal side) would

                      submit that the investigation is still pending and this petition is in

                      premature stage and hence, he prayed for dismissal of this petition.
</p>


<p id="p_4">                            4.Heard both sides and perused the materials available on

                      record.

                      investigated. Further the FIR is not an encyclopedia and it need not

                      contain all facts. Further, it cannot be quashed in the threshold. This

                      Court finds that the FIR discloses prima facie commission of

                      cognizable offence and as such this Court cannot interfere with the

                      investigation.   The   investigating        machinery    has    to   step     in   to

                      investigate, grab and unearth the crime in accordance with the

                      procedures prescribed in<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_6"> the Code</a>.

                            is called for only in a case where the
                            complaint does not disclose any offence, or
                            is frivolous, vexatious, or oppressive. If the
                            allegations set out in the complaint do not
                            constitute the offence of which cognizance
                            has been taken by the Magistrate, it is open
                            to the High Court to quash the same. It is

                            the case should be done before the Trial to

</p><p id="p_8">                                         9. Having heard the learned Senior
                                   Counsel and examined the material on
                                   record, we are of the considered view that
                                   the High Court ought not to have set aside
                                   the order passed by the Trial Court issuing
                                   summons to the Respondents. A perusal of
                                   the complaint discloses that prima facie,
                                   offences   that   are   alleged     against   the
                                   Respondents. The correctness or otherwise
                                   of the said allegations has to be decided
                                   only in the Trial. At the initial stage of
                                   issuance of process it is not open to the
                                   Courts to stifle the proceedings by entering
                                   into the merits of the contentions made on
                                   behalf of the accused. Criminal complaints
                                   cannot be quashed only on the ground that
                                   the allegations made therein appear to be of
                                   a civil nature. If the ingredients of the
                                   offence alleged against the accused are
                                   prima facie made out in the complaint, the
                                   criminal    proceeding      shall      not     be
