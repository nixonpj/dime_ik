 IN THE HIGH COURT OF JUDICATURE FOR RAJASTHAN 
 JAIPUR BENCH, JAIPUR
ORDER 
SB Civil Writ Petition No.18633/2011
Puneet Sharma versus Rajasthan University of Health Sciences &amp; anr
16.2.2012
HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE MN BHANDARI
Ms Sangita Sai  for petitioner 
BY THE COURT: </pre>
		
<p id="p_1">		It is a case where respondent issued an advertisement calling for application for the post of Pharmacist. It is alleged to have been  issued after 20 years thus for last many years no recruitment on the aforesaid post has taken place. Grievance of the petitioner is accordingly against the Rajasthan University of Health Sciences as his result of B.Pharma examination is not given as per the expectation of the petitioner. 
</p>
<p id="p_2">		Learned counsel for petitioner urged that petitioner remain  a brilliant student throughout  as he secured high marks in B.Pharma Part-I, Part-II and  Part-III examinations. Petitioner appeared in B.Pharma Part IV examination in August,  2011. In the aforesaid examination, he was declared fail in one of the subjects. The result aforesaid was shocking  and beyond expectation of the petitioner hence he applied for revaluation by making application on 3.12.2011. The result of the revaluation has not been declared by the respondent University as yet though prior to the aforesaid advertisement was published on 26.11.2011 calling for application for the post of Pharmacist. Since petitioner's result of revaluation has not been declared, he failed to apply for the aforesaid post pursuant to the advertisement. A direction is sought on the respondent No.1 to declare result of revaluation and, at the same time, a direction on the respondent No.2 to allow petitioner to participate in the process of selection for the post of Pharmacist.
</p>
<p id="p_3">		I have considered submission of learned counsel for petitioner and perused record of the case. 
</p>
<p id="p_4">		If the facts of this case are looked into, advertisement for the post of Pharmacist was issued on 26.11.2011.Result of the petitioner was declared on 19.11.2011 and he applied for revaluation on 3.12.2011. Petitioner was declared fail in one subject thus he failed to qualify  required course to become eligible for the post of Pharmacist. Last date for making application was 17.12.2011 with a direction to apply with the hard copy by 20.12.2011. When petitioner applied for revaluation on 3.12.2011 it cannot be expected from the respondents to declare result thereof overnight. In any case, if the last date for submission of application was 17.12.2011 and petitioner applied for revaluation on 3.12.2011, it was expected from the petitioner to apply for the post after explaining the position. The petitioner has not even applied for the post thus question of direction to the respondent No.2 to allow him to appear in the selection does not arise. This is apart from the fact that a person who is not in possession of requisite qualification, cannot claim his appearance in the selection. Petitioner has not qualified B.Pharma course thus prayer made in this writ petition cannot be accepted. 
</p>
<p id="p_5">		In view of the discussion made above, writ petition is found devoid of merit. Hence, writ petition so as the stay application are dismissed.
