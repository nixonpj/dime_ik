<p id="p_1">3   05-11-2018                  This revision application has been preferred against

                  the order dated 17.10.2017 passed in Sessions Trial No. 241 of

                  2017, arising out of Bikram P.S.Case No. 78 of 2015 by which

                  learned Additional District and Sessions Judge-II, Danapur has

                  held the petitioner as juvenile and later on the order of Juvenile

                  Justice Board (in short 'Board') dated 23.7.2018 has also been

                  brought on record, by which opposite party No.2 has been

                  declared juvenile, and petitioner has challenged the same also.

</p><p id="p_2">                                In course of argument it has been submitted by

                  learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner that petitioner has

                  already died and son of the petitioner has filed an affidavit to

                  pursue the case.

         is wife of deceased Ramesh Kumar and son of informant

         Ramesh Kumar made a mobile call to the informant to come at

         his sasural and thereafter the petitioner along with other person

         went at the house of Sunil Singh where he found Ramesh

         injured condition and on query he disclosed that his father-in-

         law and other accused persons, including opposite party No.2 in

         conspiracy assaulted him and and cut the vain of hand and leg

         and due to which he received injuries and later on Ramesh

         Kumar succumbed to the injuries. It further appears from the

         record that after investigation charge sheet was submitted

         against opposite party No.2 and other accused persons and case

         was committed to the court of sessions.
</p>
<p id="p_4">                      Later on opposite party No.2 filed a petition under

         <a href="/doc/1510082/" id="a_1">Section 7</a> of the Juvenile Justice (Care and <a href="/doc/1973522/" id="a_2">Protection of

         Children) Act</a> (in short 'Act') and requested for sending the

         matter to the Board claiming to be a juvenile as her date of birth

         was 9.6.1997, i.e., below 18 years of age. Learned Sessions

         Judge relying upon the entry made in the Matriculation

         certificate remanded the matter to the Board and that order is

         also under challenge. Later on the Board has also declared her

         juvenile by order dated 23.7.2018 which has been brought on

         record by way of supplementary affidavit.

                      Submission of learned Sr.Counsel for the petitioner is

         that father of opposite party No.2 sworn an affidavit for getting

         benefit of "Kanya Vivah Yojna" and further it is alleged that the

         entry made in the Matriculation certificate was not correct entry

         and the same was manipulated and as such the order declaring

         opposite party No.2 as juvenile is not sustainable.

<p id="p_7">                      Having heard both sides and from perusal of the order

         of the Board dated 23.7.2018 it appears that the Board has

         declared opposite party No.2 as juvenile on the basis of

         Matriculation certificate which has been held by Bihar School

         Examination Board also.
