             Forests with good bio-diversity of Wildlife, epiphytes, climbers,
             creepers, shrubs, medicinal plants. The ground floor of the
             Forests have a very good leave litter which is rich in humus
             content and which supports the habitat of insects and other
             small herbivores and carnivores. The limestone which occur in
             the forests having natural fissured/fractures lime-stones of
             varying depth and sizes offers a good habitat for small animals
             and nocturnal bats. The ficus species and other miscellaneous
             species which grew on the limestone have the roots spreading
             and protects the soil from erosion, landslide etc.

             certificate of the respondent (1) Shri. Coles Paslein, (2) Shri.

<blockquote id="blockquote_2">                   As seen in the photographs the Mixed Deciduous Forests is
            having different storey of the Deciduous Forests tree species
            with shrubs, bamboos, climbers, creepers and with good ground

<blockquote id="blockquote_3">                  The villagers of Umkyrpong village depends their bonafide
            and livelihood on the forests for cultivation and the forests as a
            source of fire wood for construction purposes and water.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">                  The forest land as per the Land Holding Certificates has
            been mutated to Shri. Donush Siangshai this will ultimately lead
            way for the destruction of these Village Forests. The Forest land
            therefore should remain with the village forests to protect the
            environment in order to sustain ecological balance of the forest
            land around the area and for the bonafide use of the local
            villagers.

<p id="p_4">      Besides, during the course of hearing, Mr. N.D.Chullai, learned Senior GA,
states that provisions of <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_1">Registration Act</a> 1908 have already been extended to the
State of Meghalaya. Moreover, it is submitted on behalf of the appellant that the
application for registration and transfer of forest land in question is being sought
on the basis of Katcha Sale Deed. However, at the end of hearing, learned Sr.
Counsel, Mr. ODV Ladia, prays for and is permitted to withdraw the writ appeal
perhaps in order to escape the liability, if any, to follow. Writ appeal thus stands
dismissed as withdrawn.
