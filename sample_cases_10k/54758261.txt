RAJ MOHAN SINGH, J. (Oral)
</pre>
<p id="p_1">[1].    Petitioners have assailed the order dated 25.05.2015

passed by the Addl. District Judge, Patiala vide which interim

injunction granted by the trial Court was vacated.

[2].    Learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that

initially the property was owned by Municipal Corporation,

Patiala and thereafter the same was transferred to Improvement

Trust, Patiala on 15.03.2013. The predecessor-in-interest of the

plaintiffs/petitioners were recorded to be in possession of the

property as tenant as per jamabandi for the year 1961-62

onwards. At the relevant time, the land was agricultural in

nature, but with the passage of time, the nature of the suit land

kept on changing. As per jamabandi for the year 1966-67

Raghbir Chand predecessor-in-interest of the plaintiffs was

shown to be in possession of the suit land. The entry in column

No.9 of the said jamabandi was to the following effect:-

</p><p id="p_2">          "Chakota 725, Saal Tamam, Bila Lagan Bawaja Kabja"

[3].      The trial Court granted interim injunction in favour of the

plaintiffs on the premise that the order passed by the Assistant

Collector, Ist Grade in respect of correction of khasra girdawari

was stayed by the Collector, however the lower Appellate Court

vacated the same after noticing the fact that the proceedings

pending before the Collector stood culminated against the

plaintiffs.
</p>
<p id="p_3">[4].      I have heard learned counsel for the parties.

[5].      At the stage of granting interim injunction in terms of

Order 39 Rules 1 and 2 CPC three ingredients in terms of

existence of prima facie case, balance of convenience and

irreparable loss in the event of not granting interim relief are to

be seen.
</p>
<p id="p_4">[6].      At this stage, without embarking upon evidentiary value

of the revenue record since the year 1961-62 onwards, I am of

the view that the presumption attached to the revenue record is

rebuttable in nature. Both the parties would be at liberty to

adduce evidence in accordance with law. Since prima facie




                                 2 of 3

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4"> Civil Revision No.8132 of 2015 (O&amp;M)                         3</span>

entries were made in the revenue record showing the

predecessor-in-interest of the petitioners to be in possession of

the land against Chakota for the year 1966-67 with the

endorsement of Billa Lagan Bawaja Kabja, therefore I deem it

appropriate to consider that there is a prima facie case in favour

of the petitioners      and in the event of not protecting the

possession of the petitioners, it may result in irreparable loss.

Consequently balance of convenience is also taken to be in

favour of the petitioners, therefore, the impugned order dated

25.05.2015 passed by the lower Appellate Court is set aside.

[7].    Since there is a dispute with regard to the nature of

order passed by the revenue officials, correction of khasra

girdawari, the validity of those orders would be gone into by the

trial Court with reference to the compliance of principles of

natural justice, therefore, at this stage it would be just and

appropriate to grant status quo with regard to possession,

alienation and nature of property as it exists today. Ordered

accordingly.
</p>
<pre id="pre_2">[8].    Petition stands disposed of.
