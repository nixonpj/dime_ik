       (herein after referred to as LHA)/SDM Sh. N.K. Sharma visited
       the premises of       Sh.     Ismail Malik S/o Sh. Bashiruddin, M/s.
       System Enterprises (Silicon Beverages), G-27, Vardhman Plaza,
       Asaf Ali Road, Turkman Gate, Delhi-110002, where the said food
       article i.e 'Packaged Drinking Water' was found stored for sale
       and where accused Ismail Malik was found vending the article of
       food    i.e 'Packaged Drinking Water' at the time of taking the
       sample. The sample consisted of 3 x 20 litres sealed bottles with
       cap of 'Packaged Drinking Water' (ready for sale) each of same
       lot having Label declaration. The Food Inspector disclosed his
       identity and expressed his intention to purchase a sample of
       "Packaged Drinking Water" from the vendor for analysis. The
       sample was taken under the supervision / direction of Sh N.K.
       Sharma SDM/LHA. The Food Inspector divided the sample of the
       article of food into three equal parts then and there, one sealed
       bottle as one counterpart. Each sample bottle was separately
       packed, fastened and sealed according to the PFA Act, 1954 &amp;
       Rules, 1955. The vendor's signature were obtained on the LHA
       slip and the wrapper of the sample counter parts. Notice was
       given to the accused Ismail Malik and price of the sample was
       also paid to him vide vendor receipt dated 26.06.2009.
       Panchanama was prepared at the spot. All the documents
       prepared by FI were signed by the accused Ismail Malik and the
       other witness Sh Siya Ram, FA. Before taking sample proceeding
       efforts were made to join public witnesses but none came
       forward, as such Sh Siya Ram, FA was joined as witness.
</p>

<p id="p_3">   3. One counter-part of the sample was also sent to Public Analyst,


CC No. 44144/16 DA vs Ismail Malik                              Page No. 2/10
        Delhi bearing LHA Code number 11/LHA/25314 in intact condition
       and two counter-parts were deposited with the LHA/SDM in intact
       condition. Public Analyst analysed the sample and found the
       same to be adulterated. The report of the Public Analyst is as
       follows:-
</p><p id="p_4">       "The sample does not conform to standard because Aerobic
       bacterial count exceeding the prescribed maximum limit of 100
       colonies per ml.      The sample was also misbranded because
       because best before was declared in a misleading manner and
       language of Best before declaration was not as per Rule 32i of
       PFA Act &amp; Rules. The public analyst had also reported in her
       above said report regarding Label- Best before declared as best
       for consumption within one month from the date of packing with
       ISI mark. However, date of packing not mentioned on the label."
</p>

<p id="p_5">   4. It was observed that on the label of the sampled article of food
       the date of manufacturing had been mentioned but it had no
       relevance with respect to the best before period of one month
       which is given from the date of packing whereas the date of
       packing has not been mentioned on the label.        As per label
       declaration the sampled article of food "Packaged Drinking Water"
       was manufactured by M/s Diamond Food &amp; Beverages, B-65,
       Lawrence Road, New Delhi-110035 and marketed by M/s Silicon
       Beverages, T.G. Asaf Ali Road, Delhi-2 and was having brand
       name "Silicon" TM. But during investigation, it was revealed to
       the Food Inspector that earlier M/s Silicon Beverages (System
       Enterprises) was having an agreement with the partners of M/s
       Diamond Food &amp; Beverages. As per terms and condition of the
       agreement dated 24.12.07 M/s Diamond Food &amp; Beverages was


CC No. 44144/16 DA vs Ismail Malik                          Page No. 3/10
        to manufacture "Packaged Drinking Water" under Brand Name
       "Silicon" TM and which was to be marked/sold by M/s Silicon
       Beverages. However, later on, the partners of M/s Diamond Food
       &amp; Beverages sold their unit to M/s Gold Star Enterprises as per
       agreement dated 07.01.2009. Further M/s God Star Enterprises
       has no agreement with M/s Silicon Beverages (System
       Enterprises) for manufacture of said "Packaged Drinking Water".
       It was revealed to the Food Inspector during investigation that the
       said sampled article of food "Packaged Drinking Water" was
       manufactured and packed by M/s Silicon Beverages (System
       Enterprises) at their own plant located at 2144, Ahata Meer
       Bukhari Turkman Gate, Delhi-110002 under the brand name of
       "Silicon" TM under the pseudonym M/s Diamond Food &amp;
       Beverages, B-65, Lawrence Road, New Delhi-110035. M/s Silicon

       /certification    from        Bureau   of   Indian   Standards     for
       manufacture/packaging of "Packaged Drinking Water" at above
       said plant located at 2144, Ahata Meer Bukhari Turkman Gate,
       Delhi-110002.
</p>

<p id="p_6">   5. It is the case of the complainant that accused Ismail Malik was
       the vendor-cum-proprietor of M/s. System Enterprises (Silicon
       Beverages), having sales unit at G-27, Vardhman Plaza, Asaf Ali
       Road, Turkman Gate, Delhi-110002 and manufacturing unit at
       2144, Ahata Meer Bukhari, Turkman Gate, Delhi-110002 at the
       time of taking sample and he looks after the business of both
       units and as such he was incharge of and responsible for day to
       day conduct of business of said manufacturing and sales unit M/s

        and the same concern which was owned by the vendor Ismail
       Malik.
</p>

<p id="p_7">   6. Thereafter on completion of investigation, sanction under section
       20 of the PFA Act was obtained from the Director PFA. The
       complaint was then filed in the court on 28.07.2010 alleging
       violation of Section 2(ia)(a)(e) and (l) of the PFA Act, 1954,
       punishable under section 7/16(1A) of PFA Act,1954 and also

       section 7/16(1)(a) of the PFA Act, 1954.
</p>

<p id="p_9">   7. As the complaint was filed in writing by a public servant, recording
       of pre-summoning evidence was dispensed with and the accused
       was summoned vide order dated 28.07.2010. An application was
       moved by accused Ismail Malik U/s 13 (2) of PFA Act, 1954 to
       send the second counter-part sample to Director, CFL for analysis
       on 21.08.2010. However, the said application was disposed off as
       withdrawn on 01.10.2010 as accused had made statement for
       withdrawal of the same.
</p>

<p id="p_10">   8. Based on the report of the PA and pre-charge evidence, charge
       was framed against the accused for violating the provisions of

        trial.
</p>

<p id="p_12">   9. At the trial, the prosecution examined five witnesses in support of
       its case i.e. PW-1 FI Shyam Lal, PW2 FSO Ranjeet Singh, PW3
       FA Siya Ram, PW4 PA Smt. Mohini Srivastava and PW5
       SDM/LHA Sh. N.K. Sharma. PW-1, PW-3 and PW-5 were part of
       the team that had visited the spot for sample proceedings under
       the supervision of SDM/LHA Sh N.K. Sharma. These witnesses
       narrated the steps undertaken by them during the sample
       proceedings, including disclosing their identity, expressing
       intention to purchase sample for analysis, lifting the sample of 3
       sealed jars/bottles of 20 litres each of "Packaged Drinking Water"
       bearing identical label declaration, on payment of Rs.390/- vide
       Vendor's Receipt, converting the sample commodity into three
       equal parts, by putting one sealed jar/bottle as one counterpart.
       All the three counterparts were separately packed, fastened, and
       sealed, as per PFA Act and Rules and obtaining signatures of
       vendor and witnesses. They also proved the necessary
       documents including the vendor's receipt Ex.PW-1/A, Notice in
       form VI Ex. PW-1/B, Panchnama Ex.PW-1/C. Thereafter, two
       counterparts of sample along with Memo as per Form-VII were
       sent to PA for analysis vide PA Receipt Ex. PW-1/D with the
       intimation that one counterpart of the same in intact condition has
       already been deposited with PA Ex.PW1/E. Thereafter PA Report
       Ex.PW1/F was received according to which the sample was not
       conforming to standards and was also 'misbranded' and
       'misleading'. During investigation, PW1 sent a letter to the vendor
       through registered post vide Ex.PW1/G. He sent two letters to
       DHO, MCD through registered post vide Ex.PW1/H &amp; Ex.PW1/H-
</p>

<p id="p_13">CC No. 44144/16 DA vs Ismail Malik                            Page No. 6/10
</p><p id="p_14">        1. He sent a letter to VAT Officer, Ward No. 8 through registered
       post vide Ex.PW1/I for seeking information on the constitution of
       M/s System Enterprises (Silicon Beverages). During investigation,
       accused submitted his hand written statement to PW1 ExPW1/J.
       Alongwith the statement, accused handed over a Visiting Card
       Ex.PW1/J-1. PW1 handed over a letter to Director, BIS
       Ex.PW1/K. He sent another letter by hand to Sh. R.K. Rastogi,
       Scientist-B (MDD-I), BIS, New Delhi ExPW1/K1 and received two
       replies from the said Scientist Ex.PW1/K2 and Ex.PW1/K3.
       During further investigations, PW1 sent a reminder to M/s
       Diamond Food &amp; Beverages is Ex.PW1/L and letter received from
       owner of M/s Gold Star Enterprises is Ex.PW1/M. Thereafter on
       completion of the investigation, the entire case file alongwith all
       the documents were sent through LHA/SDM to then Director PFA
       Sh R.K. Mishra, who after going through the case file, applied his
       mind and gave his consent for prosecution Ex.PW1/N. Thereafter,
       the present complaint Ex.PW2/A was filed before this Court. Then
       intimation letter alongwith copies of PA's Report were sent to the
       accused which were not received back undelivered. All the
       witnesses were duly cross examined by the Ld Defence Counsel.
       During cross-examination, PW1 denied the suggestion that
       accused had shown the original bill of purchase to him bearing
       No. 490 dated 25.06.2009. He further admitted that if bacteria are
       present in the sample commodity then with lapse of time they will
       increase.    He admitted that in Form VI Ex.PW1/B, the batch
       number and the date of packing i.e 26.06.2009 was mentioned.
       Bill Mark PW1/D1 was shown to the witness and he stated that he
       could not say if this bill was shown by the accused at the spot.
       PW3 admitted during his cross-examination that the name of the


CC No. 44144/16 DA vs Ismail Malik                            Page No. 7/10
        manufacturer was written as Diamond Food Beverage, Lawrence
       Road, Industrial Area, New Delhi-35 on Form VI. PW4 stated
       during his cross-examination that Aerobic microbial count and
       aerobic bacterial count are the same thing and denied the
       suggestion that aerobic microbial count multiply with the lapse of
       time. She added that the sample was received in original sealed
       condition and the best before was mentioned on the label
       declaration. PW5 stated during his cross-examination that he did
       not remember whether the original purchased bill Mark PW1/D-1
       was taken from the vendor at the spot and he did not remember
       whether the accused had disclosed the source of purchase at the
       spot.    He added that he could not say whether the report of PA
       was received or delivered to the accused.
</p>

<p id="p_15">   10.         Statement of the accused under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_2">section 313</a> CrPC was
       recorded on 30.09.2019 wherein the accused denied the
       allegations and pleaded innocence. He however admitted the
       sample proceedings and stated that he had supplied the sample
       commodity in the same sealed condition and he had disclosed the
       source of purchase M/s Diamond Food Beverages and the
       photocopy of the bill was handed over to the Food Inspector but
       the Food Inspector in connivance let the manufacturer off who
       was the actual culprit. He also added that the complaint was filed
       in the court after the expiry date of the sample and his valuable
       right was frustrated. Accused opted not to lead any DE and the
       DE was closed and the matter was listed for final arguments.
</p>

<p id="p_16">   11.          In a criminal trial, the burden is on the complainant /
       prosecution to establish its case against the accused beyond


CC No. 44144/16 DA vs Ismail Malik                           Page No. 8/10
        reasonable doubt. This burden cannot be shifted to the accused
       and has to be necessarily discharged by the prosecution itself by
       leading cogent and trustworthy evidence. However, if the accused
       has any defence, then the burden to prove that defence lies upon
       the accused.
</p>

<p id="p_17">   12.        The present case is for adulteration of food article i.e.
       Packaged Drinking Water.
</p>

<p id="p_18">   13.        Now coming to the issue of adulteration, the PA report has
       found the drinking water not as per standard because it contains
       Aerobic bacterial count exceeding the prescribed maximum limit
       of 100 colonies per ml.        The sample was also misbranded
       because because best before was declared in a misleading
       manner and language of Best before declaration was not as per
       Rule 32i of PFA Act &amp; Rules.
</p>

<p id="p_19">   14.        It is pertinent to mention that the standard prescribed for
       packed drinking water is under A.33 of the Appendix B of PFA
       Rules. It is an admitted fact that no offence of misbranding has
       been made out qua the sample commodity i.e Packaged Drinking
       Water as PW1 himself stated during his cross-examination that
       the date of packaging has been mentioned in Ex.PW1/B as
       26.06.2009. Perusal of Ex.PW1/B shows the date of packaging
       the water as 25.06.2009 and it is stated to be best before one
       month before the date of packaging. The Food Inspector Sh.
       Shyam Lal has reproduced the entire label in Ex.PW1/B, Form VI.
       The sample proceeding in the present case were conducted on
       26.06.2009 and was sent for analysis to the Public Analyst on the


CC No. 44144/16 DA vs Ismail Malik                           Page No. 9/10
        next working day. The Public Analyst has alleged the sample from
       29.06.2009 to 09.07.2009. The report of PA is dated 16.07.2009.
       However, the complaint was filed before the Court only on
       28.07.2010, after the expiry of the sample commodity. It is an
       admitted fact that the accused has not denied the sample
       proceedings. However, the fact that the complaint was filed after
       the expiry of the sample commodity which was beyond the best
       before date. Therefore, in the present case, it can be said that
       the valuable right of Section 13(2) of PFA Act given to the
       accused to send the sample commodity to Director, CFL for
       analysis was frustrated as the sample commodity had expired
       after the lapse of one month.   There appear to be lapses on the
       part of the food officials in the present case wherein despite being
       aware of the the name and details of manufacturer he was not
       arrayed as an accused in the present complaint.
