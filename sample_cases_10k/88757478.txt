                        **************
      THESE WRIT PETITIONS ARE FILED UNDER ARTICLES 226 &amp;
227 OF THE CONSTITUTION OF INDIA, PRAYING TO DIRECT THE
R1 AND R2 TO RETAIN / MAINTAIN THE CIVIL AMENITY SITES LIKE
GARDEN, PLAYGROUND, PARK, ETC., IN SY. NOS. 108. 109 AND
137 AS PER THE SANCTIONED PLAN AND THE SKETCH OF THE
BOARD AT THE TIME OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SCHEME AND
ALLOTMENT OF THE HOUSES TO THE PETITIONERS VIDE ANNEX-
T. AND ETC.


     THESE PETITIONS COMING ON FOR PRELIMINARY
HEARING-B GROUP THIS DAY, THE COURT MADE THE
FOLLOWING:

                             ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">1.     In these writ petitions, petitioners are seeking a direction

to the state Government and the Karnataka Housing Board -

respondents 1 and 2 herein to retain the civic amenity sites like

garden, playground, park etc. as per the sanctioned plan and

the sketch of the Board vide Annexure-T prepared at the time of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                    3</span>



implementation of the scheme for allotment of houses to the

various allottees.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">2.    Petitioner No.1 claims to be the society of the allottees

who have been allotted sites by the Housing Board in the

Housing   Board      Colony   at   Ganhinagar,   Yelahanka. It is

submitted by the learned counsel for the petitioner that the 2nd

petitioner is no more. As the 1st petitioner is espousing the case

of the other allottees and the grievance made is for and on

behalf of the allottees, the matter is examined keeping in mind

the interest of the allottees and the allegations made in the

petition that certain portion of the land which were required to

be reserved for park and other civic amenities has been

denotified thereby depriving the allottees of the benefit of the

civic amenities. As regards petitioner No.2 who claimed to be

the President of the petitioner No.1 society, the Writ Petition

has abated. In fact, the President's presence is unnecessary as

the Secretary is representing the society.
</p>
<p id="p_4">

</p><p id="p_5">3.    It has to be noticed at the outset that as back as in the

year 2004 by a notification issued under <a href="/doc/983800/" id="a_1">Section 48(1)</a> of the

Land Acquisition Act (for short 'the Act') an extent of 3 acres 33
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                  4</span>



guntas of land comprised in Sy. No.108 of Yelahank Village has

been denotified from the acquisition. This writ petition is filed in

the year 2011.
</p>
<p id="p_6">
</p><p id="p_7">4.    According to the petition averments, the Karnataka

Housing Board had acquired 16 acres 33 guntas of land in Sy.

Nos.108, 109 and 137 of Yelahanka Upanagar for formation of

layout and to construct houses. Challenge in this petition is to

Annexure-B communication issued by the State Government,

Department of Housing addressed to the Commissioner,

Karnataka    Housing    Board,    Bangalore    dated   07.09.2001

recommending for taking steps to denotify an extent of 3 acres

30 guntas of land comprised in Sy. No.108 from acquisition.

Although based on the said communication a notification under

<a href="/doc/983800/" id="a_2">Section 48(1)</a> has been issued and published in the Karnataka

Gazette on 04.03.2004, petitioner has not challenged the same.

At any rate, it has to be observed at the outset that Annexure-G

notification having been issued way back in the year 2004, the

present writ petition filed in the year 2011 is highly belated.


</p><p id="p_8">5.    The petitioners are guilty of delay and latches in laying a

challenge to the denotification of the land that is brought about

in the year 2004. It is also not shown how the denotification of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                  5</span>



this land has deprived the petitioners of the civic amenities

made available to them.
</p>
<p id="p_9">
</p><p id="p_10">6.     Respondent Nos.3 and 4 have filed objections taking up a

contention that the writ petition filed by the petitioner-Society is

the outcome of personal animosity and malafide intention on

the part of the petitioners to harass the respondent-owners of

the land to make wrongful gain. According to them, they had

made a representation for denotifying the land with an object of

carrying on nursery and therefore, the Authorities denotified

the land and that the answering respondents were making use

of the land for the purpose for which the land is denotified.

They have further stated in paragraph 4 of the statement of

objections that there is sufficient space left for the civic

amenities like partks, roads and public buildings and sufficient

open space has been reserved for this purpose to enable the

allottees to effectively enjoy their house.


</p><p id="p_11">7.     In this background both on the ground of delay and

latches and also on merits, the petitioner-Society has failed to

make    out   any   genuine   grievance       to   interfere   with   the

notification denotifying the land. As already stated, notification

denotifying the land is also not challenged.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                 6</span>




</p><p id="p_12">8.    Insofar as the other prayers sought at prayer Nos.3 and 4

are concerned which pertain to quashing of endorsement dated

13.12.2004 issued vide Annexure-L by the Karnataka Housing

Board negativing the request of the petitioners for reduction of

price for marginal land and also with regard to the grant of land

in favour of respondents 3 and 4 to an extent of 656.50 sq.

mtrs., the writ petition filed has been already dismissed by

order dated 28.02.2012 at the time of preliminary hearing. The

said order passed by this Court reads as under:


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">            "Sri Chandrakanth Goulay, learned advocate
      appearing for the petitioners does not press prayer
      No.(ii). However, he presses for prayer Nos.(i), (iii)
      and (iv).
</blockquote>


<blockquote id="blockquote_2">            So far as prayer No.(iii) is concerned, the
      petitioners sought for quashing the endorsement
      issued by the second respondent dated 13.12.2004
      vide Annexure-L, by which the Karnataka Housing
      Board, Bangalore has intimated the petitioners that
      the petitioner's prayer for reduction of price for
      marginal land cannot be allowed. Thus, it is clear
      that Housing Board has fixed certain price for
      marginal land as per law and the petitioners were
      required to pay the cost of the marginal land as
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                               7</span>



     directed by the Housing Board.        However, the
     petitioners' prayer for reduction of price of the
     marginal land came to be rejected.         Such an
     endorsement is made in the year 2004 i..e., eight
     years prior to filing of these writ petitions.   The
     petitioners slept over for eight years.   Hence, no
     interference is called for in the writ petitions
     relating to order dated 13.12.2004 vide Annexure-L.
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_3">           So also, with regard to prayer No.(iv), the
     Housing Board has passed a resolution dated
     16.12.2004 granting marginal land in favour of
     respondents 3 and 4 to an extent of 656.50
     sq.mtrs. The same is questioned by the petitioners.
     Petitioners cannot be allowed to question the
     resolution of the Housing Board after lapse of eight
     years. Absolutely no reasons are forthcoming to
     condone the delay of eight years.    Hence, prayer
     No.(iv) also stands rejected on the ground of delay
     and latches.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">           Issue notice to the respondents with regard to
     prayer No.(i) only".
</blockquote>


<p id="p_13">9.   Therefore, it is unnecessary to deal with these prayers.

Hence, in my considered view, the petitioner-Society which has

come up with the grievance against the Government denotifying

the land, after lapse of nearly 7 years cannot be permitted to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                8</span>



assail the said decision without producing proper materials and

without properly explaining the delay and in particular, without

showing how the said decision has prejudiced the allottees. As

the petitioner-Society has failed on both the grounds in

satisfactorily establishing its grievance, the writ petitions are

liable to be dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_14">
</p><p id="p_15">      Hence, these writ petitions are dismissed.
