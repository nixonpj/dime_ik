                                           JUDGMENT AND ORDER

</pre><p id="p_1">                     Heard Mr. N. Dutta, the learned Senior counsel appearing for the petitioner.
              The respondents are represented by Mr. D. Saikia, the learned Addl. Advocate
              General, Assam.
</p>
<p id="p_2">              2.     The petitioner applied for admission for medical studies against the 85%
              State quota seats, but he is considered ineligible because of Rule 3(1)(c) of the
              Medical Colleges and Dental Colleges of Assam (Regulation of Admission into 1st
              year MBBS/BDS Course) Rules, 2017 (hereinafter referred to as the "Admission
              Rules, 2017"). The Rule stipulates that a student should have studied in a Assam
              School in all classes from Class VII - Class XII. The applicant has done his schooling
              outside the State and he seeks prospective operation of the Rule 3(1)(c), from the
              next year's admission.
</p>
<p id="p_3">              3.     In this case, the admission seeker is Kaaranjit Mushahary (All India Rank-
              184931, State Rank-1803).
</p>
<p id="p_4">              4.     Some candidates who have pursued their school education in outside Assam
              schools for which, they are considered ineligible for the 85% State quota seats in
              the Government Medical Colleges of Assam, by application of Rule 3(1)(c) of the
              Admission Rules, 2017 challenged the validity of Rule 3(1)(c) but the Division Bench
              on 2.8.2017, had declared the Rule 3(1)(c) of the Admission Rules, 2017, to be
              valid. However, the matters were remanded to the Single Judge to determine
              whether, the new Rule gazetted on 11.7.2017, will govern this year's admission, for
              which the admission process started with the Notice issued on 30.1.2017 by the
              CBSE, for conducting the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) (UG) for
              2017-2018, for admission to MBBS/BDS Courses.
</p>
<p id="p_5">              5.     The admission for medical seats was regulated earlier by the Medical
              Colleges of Assam, Regional Dental College, Guwahati and the Government
              Ayurvedic College, Guwahati (Regulation of Admission of Under-Graduate Students)


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">WP(C) 4150/2017                                                                          Page 2 of 14</span>
               Rules, 2007 (hereinafter referred to as "the 2007 Regulation"). This was repealed by
              the Assam (Regulation of Admission into 1st Year MBBS/BDS Courses) Rules, 2015
              (hereinafter referred to as "the 2015 Regulation"). Under Rule 3(1) of the later
              Regulation, it was stipulated that the candidates must study in all classes from Class
              VII to XII in the State of Assam to avail the Assam Quota Seats. Thereafter, by the
              educational notice dated 6.5.2015, the provision was relaxed and made applicable
              for candidates applying for the Combined Entrance Examination or CEE, 2015.
</p>
<p id="p_6">              6.     Those affected by the stipulation for studying in Assam School for availing
              the State Quota Seats, challenged the vires of the amended 2015 Regulation and
              the substitution of Rule 3(1)(c), by the amendment notification dated 30.1.2016.
              The WP(C) No.4904/2016 (Hiralal Choudhury Vs. State of Assam) and other cases
              were analogously decided by the High Court on 28.9.2016 and the Division Bench
              declared the classification to be irrational, legally discriminatory and violative of
              <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_1">Article 14.</a> It was accordingly held that Rule 3(1)(c) as amended in 2016 cannot be
              invoked, to deny admission, to the concerned aspirants.
</p>
<p id="p_7">              7.     In supersession of the 2015 Regulation, the Admission Rules, 2017 was
              gazetted on 11.7.2017 and as earlier noted, the stipulation of studies in Assam
              Schools under Rule 3(1)(c), is again obstructing the admission of the aspirants to
              the State quota seats, in the session 2017.

<p id="p_18">                                          PETITIONER'S ARGUMENT

              9.1    Referring to the above dates, the petitioner contends that the admission
              process for the session 2017 commenced with the CBSE's notification dated
              30.1.2017 and the DME's notification of 8.2.2017. With the declaration of the NEET
              result on 23.6.2017 and the release of the State Merit List on 1.7.2017 (based on
              NEET examination performance) and also the Educational Notice dated 3.7.2017
              notifying the dates of counselling for the State Quota Seats, the rights to secure
              admission for this year's medical seats got crystalized. Therefore it is argued that
              the change of the eligibility criteria with the Admission Rules, 2017 enforced on
              11.7.2017, cannot disturb the already crystalized rights of the petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_19">              9.2    Mr. N. Dutta, the learned Senior counsel submits that the Admission Rules,
              2017 notified midway through the process, cannot be applied for to the 2017
              session as the disability attached for the aspirants, under Rule 3(1)(c) of the
              recently notified Rules, 2017, should not effect those, who started their admission
              quest, well before the new Rules were notified.
</p>
<p id="p_20">              9.3    The norms of admission to the State Medical Colleges have been changed
              from time to time and the petitioner contends that when the admission process

<p id="p_21">              9.4    The 2007 Regulation was superseded by the 2015 Regulation which in turn
              was amended on 30.1.2016 through substitution of Rules 3(1)(c). Since under the
              judgment dated 28.9.2016 in the WP(C) No.4904/2016 (Hiralal Choudhury vs. State
              of Assam and others), the Division Bench struck down Rule 3(1)(c) substituted by

              Regulation, was followed by the respondents. Hence it is argued that for this year's
              admission, the norms in the Educational Notice of 6.5.2015 should govern, the
              admission for the 2017 session and the Admission Rules, 2017 gazetted on
              11.7.2017, cannot be applied to deny admission for the aspirants, in the current

              10.1   On the other hand, Mr. D. Saikia, the learned Addl. Advocate General
              submits that the admission process for the State Quota Seats commenced only on
              11.7.2017, when the admission notice was issued by the DME, Assam and since the
              Admission Rules 2017 was also gazetted on the same date i.e. 11.7.2017, the
              respondents argue that the eligibility criteria prescribed under Rule 3(1)(c) of the
              Admission Rules, 2017, should apply for the 2017 session also.

<p id="p_23">               10.2   The learned Addl. Advocate General refers to sub-rule (2) of Rule 1 to
              project that the Admission Rules, 2017 was made applicable from the academic
              session 2017 itself and accordingly it is argued that it is not a case of retrospective
              application of the norms. Moreover since the norms have been simultaneously
              notified with the admission notice, the admission for the State Quota Seats must be
              made, on the basis of the norms in the Admission Rules, 2017.
</p>
<p id="p_24">              10.3   The respondents contend that the eligibility of the aspirants must be judged
              on the date of the admission notice i.e. 11.7.2017 and participation in the NEET
              (UG) 2017 examination and securing their respective ranks as per the result
              declared on 23.6.2017, will not entitle the aspirants to claim admission on the basis
              of the norms prevalent prior to 11.7.2017.
</p>
<p id="p_25">              10.4   The respondents claim that success in the NEET (UG) 2017 examination
              merely qualifies an aspirant for admission for MBBS/BDS seats but the merit in the
              entrance test will not confer any vested right for admission, for the State Quota
              Seats and the learned Addl. A.G. compares the NEET examination with the TET
              examination, the success in which, does not guarantee a job but it is only a
              qualifying barrier.

<p id="p_26">              10.5   According to the respondents the Admission Rules, 2017 have been notified
              in exercise of the executive powers of the State under <a href="/doc/694670/" id="a_2">Article 162</a> of the
              Constitution and projecting the Admission Rules to be a case of subordinate
              legislation, the learned Addl. Advocate General argues that such subordinate
              legislation can also be enacted, with retrospective effect.
</p>
<p id="p_27">              10.6   The learned Addl. A.G. submits that when the High Court struck down the
              Rule 3(1)(c) as substituted on 30.1.2016 in the 2015 Regulation, under the
              judgment dated 28.9.2016 in the WP(C) No.4904/2016 (Hiralal Choudhury Vs. State
              of Assam and others), the admission to the concerned litigants was granted without
              disqualifying them for having done their schooling (Class-VI to Class-X) in outside
              Assam Schools, only because of the direction issued by the Court in paragraph 18 of
              the judgment dated 28.9.2016. But for this mandamus of the Court, the Rule
              3(1)(c) as originally enacted of the 2015 Regulation, should have governed the
              admission of those litigants. As the Division Bench had quashed only the substituted
              Rule 3(1)(c) incorporated by the amendment notification dated 30.1.2016 but the

               original Rule 3(1)(c) before substitution in the 2015 Regulation, remained intact, Mr.
              Saikia argues that if the Admission Rules, 2017 does not apply for the current
              session, the aspirants will have to satisfy the requirement of Rule 3(1)(c) of the
              2015 Regulation.

</p><p id="p_29">              11.    The admission notice issued on 30.1.2017 by the CBSE indicated that as per
              amendment made in 2016 to the Indian Medical Counsel Act, 1956 (hereinafter
              referred to as the "<a href="/doc/118783942/" id="a_3">MCI Act</a>"), admission to all seats of MBBS/BDS Courses will be
              done through NEET (UG) 2017 examination and all categories of seats, including
              State Government Quota Seats, will be filled up through this process. The eligibility
              criteria for appearing in the NEET (UG) 2017 examination was specified and it was
              stated that admission including those for the Reserve Categories will be considered,
              on the basis of the marks obtained in the NEET (UG) 2017 examination. The CBSE
              was required to provide the entrance examination results to the admitting
              authorities who are to invite application for counselling, as per the merit list, drawn
              up on the basis of ranking in the NEET (UG) 2017 examination.

<p id="p_32">              14.    It is important to be aware that the right to secure admission in the 2017
              session, was based entirely on the performance in the Entrance Test and such right
              got crystalized through declaration of NEET (UG) 2017 examination result on
              1.7.2017, followed by the DME's Educational Notice of 3.7.2017. Now the question
              is whether the Admission Rules, 2017 gazetted on 11.7.2017 should be applied for
              the aspirants, whose right to secure admission perhaps got crystallized, on the basis
              of their performance in the NEET (UG) 2017 examination.
</p>
<p id="p_33">              15.    The Admission Rules, 2017 stipulates that it shall come into force when it is
              published in the official gazette and as can be seen, the 2017 Rules was published
              in the Gazette on 11.7.2017. The sub-clause (2) of clause 1 specified that the new
              norms shall be applicable from the academic session 2017 to regulate the admission
              to the MBBS/BDS Courses in the Medical/Dental Colleges of Assam. As earlier noted,
              the admission process for the 2017 session, commenced on 30.1.2017 with the
              CBSE's notice for the NEET (UG) 2017 examination. The DME, Assam under the
              Education Notice of 8.2.2017, had directed the aspirants from the State, to apply for
              the Assam Quota Seats, through the NEET (UG) 2017 examination conducted by the
              CBSE. Therefore, unless the Admission Rules, 2017 commencing from 11.7.2017 is
              retrospectively applied to the process which started 6 months earlier, the norms
              under the Rule 3(1)(c) of the Admission Rules, 2017 cannot be made applicable for
              the aspirants, whose right to admission might have got crystallized, through
              declaration of results in the NEET (UG) 2017 examination on 23.6.2017 based upon
              which, the State Merit List was released on 1.7.2017.

              But here we are not dealing with any legislation but norms formulated by the
              Executive, where the power for retrospective change, would be severely
              circumscribed. Unless the authority of the Executive to make retrospective change
              of norms, is demonstrated without any ambiguity, the Court will not permit
              extinguishment of vested right through executive fiat.

<p id="p_35">               17.    To understand the principles of retrospective operation, we can be guided by
              the ratio in <a href="/doc/1214358/" id="a_6">The Income Tax Officer, Alleppy, vs. M.C. Ponnoose and Others</a> reported
              in (1969)2 SCC 351, where the court observed as follows -
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">                     "...................
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_7">                     Now it is open to a sovereign legislature to enact laws which have retrospective
                     operation. Even when the Parliament enacts retrospective laws such laws are - in the
                     words of Willes, J. in Phillips v. Eyre (40 Law J. Rep (N.S.) Q.B. 28 at p.37) - 'no
                     doubt prima facie of questionable policy and contrary to the general principle that
                     legislation by which the conduct of mankind is to be regulated ought, when
                     introduced for the first time, to deal with future acts, and ought not to change the
                     character of past transactions carried on upon the faith of the then existing law.' The
                     courts will not, therefore, ascribe retrospectivity to new laws affecting rights unless
                     by express words or necessary implication it appears that such was the intention of
                     the legislature. The Parliament can delegate its legislative power within the
                     recognised limits. Where any rule or regulation is made by the person or authority to
                     whom such powers have been delegated by the legislature it may or may not be
                     possible to make the same so as to give retrospective operation. It will depend on the
                     language employed in the statutory provision which may in express terms or by
                     necessary implication empower the authority concerned to make a rule or regulation
                     with retrospective effect. But where no such language is to be found it has been held
                     by the courts that the person or authority exercising subordinate legislative functions
                     cannot make a rule, regulation or bye- law which can operate with retrospective
                     effect
                     ......................."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_36">              18.    The above ratio makes it amply clear that the authority to make rules or
              regulation with retrospective impact is circumscribed. Therefore unless the authority
              is vested with specific power, they cannot formulate midstream changes to impact
              vested rights.
</p>
<p id="p_37">              19.    Commenting on presumption of prospective operation of legislation, the
              constitution bench of the Supreme Court in the case of <a href="/doc/35745659/" id="a_7">Commissioner of Income
              Tax vs. Vatika Township Private Limited</a> reported in (2015)1 SCC 1, observed that
              the idea behind the rule is that a current law should govern current activities and
              law passed today cannot apply to the events of the past. It is therefore stated that
              the basis of the principle against retrospectivity, is the principle of "fairness" which
              must be the basis of every legal rule. The legislation which modifies accrued right or
              imposes a new disability, have to be treated as prospective unless the legislative
              intent is to give the enactment, a retrospective effect.

<p id="p_38">               20.    In the present case, the Court is not examining any legislative enactment
              but the Admission Rules, 2017 notified by the government on 11.7.2017 which
              made midstream change, impacting the eligibility for admission in a process which
              commenced 6 months earlier on the basis of the CBSE's notice for the NEET (UG)
              2017 examination and the notice dated 8.2.2017 of the DME, Assam, for the
              aspirants for the State Quota Seats to appear in the NEET (UG) 2017 examination.
              When the aspirants applied for admission by appearing in the NEET (UG) 2017
              examination, they would expect their admission to be considered on the basis of the
              norms applicable on the date, when the process commenced or at least on the date
              when the entrance test result were declared. But what is seen here is that only on
              the eve of starting the counselling process, the new norms were notified. The Court
              will therefore be slow to allow retrospective application of the changed norms.
</p>
<p id="p_39">              21.    The NEET (UG) 2017 examination, in my understanding cannot be equated
              to an eligibility test to apply for admission since it is the performance in the
              entrance test which makes one entitled for admission for the current session. Only
              those who satisfy the education and age criterion specified in the CBSE's notice for
              the NEET examination, can appear in the entrance test and since the performance
              in the entrance test confers right of admission, the NEET examination cannot be
              equated to an eligibility test like the TET.
</p>
<p id="p_40">              22.    That apart, the result of the NEET (UG) 2017 examination does not have
              indefinite application like the TET result, since performance in the NEET (UG) 2017
              examination will enable admission in the current session only, whereas qualification
              in the TET examination, will enable the successful candidate to apply for teacher's
              job whenever vacancies accrue. Moreover, the Court cannot be unmindful of the
              fact that NEET (UG) 2017 examination was never intended to be an eligibility test
              since the performance in the NEET (UG) 2017 examination is made the basis for
              admission to MBBS/BDS courses. Therefore arguments made to the contrary by the
              learned Addl. A.G. is not accepted.

               MBBS/DMS Courses in the Government Colleges and therefore, the Admission Rules,
              2017 cannot be construed to be a legislative enactment.
</p>
<p id="p_42">              24.    The so called Admission Rules that the Court is concerned with in the
              present case, are not framed either under any statutory enactment or under any
              provision of the Constitution. They can at best be considered as administrative
              instruction but certainly not to be construed as Rules under <a href="/doc/694670/" id="a_8">Article 162</a> of the
              Constitution. The Supreme Court in the case of G.J. Fernandez Vs. State of Mysore
              reported in AIR 1967 SC 1753, while commenting on the executive power of the
              State under <a href="/doc/694670/" id="a_9">Article 162</a> stated that-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_8">                      ".........................................This Article in our opinion merely indicates the
                      scope of the executive power of the State; it does not 'confer any power on the State
                      Government to issue rules thereunder. As a matter of fact wherever the
                      Constitution, envisages issue of rules it has so provided in specific terms. We may,
                      for example, refer to <a href="/doc/1123043/" id="a_10">Article 309</a>, the proviso to which lays down in specific terms
                      that the President or the Governor of a State may make rules regulating the
                      recruitment and the conditions ,of service of persons appointed to services and posts
                      under the Union or the State. We are therefore of opinion that <a href="/doc/694670/" id="a_11">Article 162</a> does not
                      confer any power on the State Government to frame rules and it only indicates the
                      scope of the executive power of the State. Of course, under such executive power,
                      the State can give administrative instructions to its servants how to act in certain
                      circumstances; but that will not make such instructions statutory rules which-are
                      justiciable in certain circumstances. In order that such executive instructions have
                      the force of statutory rules it must be shown that they have been issued either under
                      the authority conferred on the State Government by some statute or under some
                      provision of the Constitution providing therefore. It is not in dispute that there is no
                      statute which confers any authority on the State Government to issue rules in
                      matters with which the Code is concerned; nor has any provision of the Constitution
                      been pointed' out to us under which these instructions can be issued as statutory
                      rules except <a href="/doc/694670/" id="a_12">Article 162.</a> But as we have already indicated, <a href="/doc/694670/" id="a_13">Article 162</a> does not
                      confer any authority on the State Government to issue statutory rules. It only
                      provides for the extent and scope of the executive power of the State Government,
                      and that coincides with the legislative power of the State legislature. Thus under
                      <a href="/doc/694670/" id="a_14">Article 162</a>, the State Government can take executive action in all matters in which
                      the legislature of the State can pass laws. But <a href="/doc/694670/" id="a_15">Article 162</a> itself does not confer any
                      rule making power on the State Government in that behalf. We are therefore of
                      opinion that instructions contained in the Code are mere administrative instructions
                      and are not statutory rules..............."

              learned Addl. A.G., the Executive made Rules one must understand, stand on a
              much weaker footing. The power of the legislature to prescribe norms


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">WP(C) 4150/2017                                                                                 Page 11 of 14</span>
               retrospectively, is not available with the executive. Therefore the executive made
              Rules cannot be allowed to retrospectively destroy any vested right, as was held in
              Uday Pratap Singh Vs. State of Bihar reported in 1994 Suppl. (3) SCC 451. The ratio
              of this verdict of the Supreme Court applies here.
</p>
<p id="p_44">              26.    The notice issued by the DME, Assam on 8.2.2017 clearly reflected that all
              aspirants for the Assam Quote MBBS/BDS Seats should apply through the NEET
              (UG) 2017 examination, to be conducted by the CBSE and therefore, there is no
              ambiguity on commencing the process of admission for the session 2017, well
              before the Admission Rules, 2017 was gazetted on 11.7.2017. Therefore I am of the
              considered opinion that obstruction to admission cannot be caused under Rule
              3(1)(c) of the Admission Rules, 2017 for those, who might have acquired their right
              of admission, on the basis of their performance in the entrance examination and the
              publication of the State Merit List on 1.7.2017.
</p>
<p id="p_45">              27.    Consequently, if the admission for the 2017 session is not to be governed by
              the Admission Rules, 2017, the question is which norm will govern the admission of
              the aspirants, who appeared in the NEET (UG) 2017 examination. For answering
              this issue, one has to take into account that this Court under the judgment dated
              28.9.2016 in the WP(C) No.4904/2016 (Hiralal Choudhury Vs. State of Assam and
              others), struck down the substituted Rule under the amendment notification of
              30.1.2016 in the 2015 Regulation. It is relevant to note that Rule 3(1)(c) as
              originally incorporated in the 2015 Regulation, is not touched by any judgment of
              the High Court. Therefore when the substituted Rule 3(1)(c) under the amended
              notification of 30.1.2016 was struck down, the admission for the litigants should
              have been considered under the originally enacted Rule 3(1)(c) of the 2015
              Regulation. But this was not done only because of the mandamus issued by the
              Court in paragraph 18 of the judgment dated 28.9.2016 in Hiralal Choudhury
              (supra). Therefore, it rationally follows that the 2015 Regulation should govern the
              admission, in the current year. It is accordingly held that the 2015 Regulation must
              be the basis for admission, in the current year for those, who applied for admission,
              by appearing in the NEET (UG) 2017 examination.

<p id="p_47">              29.    In the above context, the admission granted under the 2007 Regulation
              under DME's notice of 6.5.2015, has no connection with the Court's later judgment
              dated 28.9.2016 in Hiralal Choudhury (supra). Therefore, the submission made by
              the petitioner that in the event the Admission Rules, 2017 is not to be applied, the
              2007 Regulation will govern the admission, in the current session, is not acceptable.
              This is because the 2007 Regulation was superseded by the 2015 Regulation and it
              will be illogical to revert back to the already superseded norms, when the
              Regulation 2015 as originally enacted, has remained valid.

<p id="p_48">              30.    The Supreme Court in Dolly Chhanda Vs. Chairman, JEE reported in (2005)9
              SCC 779 had declared that while applying for any course of study, the person must
              possess the eligibility qualification on the last date for application. The period for
              application for this year's admission was scheduled during 30.1.2017 to 1.3.2017
              and hence the eligibility for the petitioner must be with reference to the last date of
              application i.e. 1.3.2017. Therefore, the admission must be granted on the basis of
              the norms, prevalent on the date when the aspirants could last apply and logically
              therefore, the new Rules cannot apply for admission in the current session.

               August 2017 as per the Educational Notice dated 3.7.2017 of the DME, the
               respondents should re-determine the eligibility with reference to the 2015
