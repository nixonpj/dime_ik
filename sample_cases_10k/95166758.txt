                   has passed orders designating specific areas where cracker shops must be

                           it. The essence of judicial review is a constitutional
                           fundamental. The role of the higher judiciary under the
                           constitution casts on it a great obligation as the
                           sentinel to defend the values of the constitution and
                           rights of Indians. The courts must, therefore, act within
                           their judicially permissible limitations to uphold the
                           rule of law and harness their power in public interest.</blockquote>

                          the Court will not interfere. When there is a valid law
                          requiring the Government to act in a particular manner
                          the Court ought not to, without striking down the law,
                          give any direction which is not in accordance with law.
                          In other words the Court itself is not above the law.
</p><p id="p_15">                                  234. In respect of public projects and policies
                          which are initiated by the Government the Courts
                          should not become an approval authority. Normally
                          such decisions are taken by the Government after due
                          care and consideration. In a democracy welfare of the
                          people at large, and not merely of a small section of
                          the society, has to be the concern of a responsible
                          Government. If a considered policy decision has been
                          taken, which is not in conflict with any law or is not
                          mala fide, it will not be in Public Interest to require
                          the Court to go into and investigate those areas which
                          are the function of the executive. For any project which
                          is approved after due deliberation the Court should
                          refrain from being asked to review the decision just
                          because a petitioner in filing a PIL alleges that such a
                          decision should not have been taken because an
                          opposite view against the undertaking of the project,
                          which    view   may   have   been   considered    by    the
                          Government, is possible. When two or more options or
                          views are possible and after considering them the
                          Government takes a policy decision it is then not the
                          function of the Court to go into the matter afresh and,
