                      date, no order for release of the said vehicle had been passed by the

                      respondents. Hence, he has come forward with the present Writ Petition.

                      transportation of mines and minerals like clay sand and there was no valid

                      permit and hence, the vehicle was seized. He would further submit that the

                      petitioner has no previous case.
