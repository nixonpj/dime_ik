                                REASONS

       The Police Inspector of Jnanabarathi        Police Station,

Bangalore has filed charge sheet against the accused persons for

the offence punishable U/Sec.392 of <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_2">IPC</a>.

2. The brief facts of the prosecution case is that, on 04/02/2018

at about 11.20 am, in front of house No.68/1, 10 th Main,

Mallathhalli, Bengaluru,    within the limits of    Jnanabarathi

Police Station, when CW.1 - Mangalamma         was plucking the

flowers, accused persons came from back side and robbed her

golden mangalya chain from her neck weighing about 60 grams.

Hence, CW.1 lodged the First Information to the Jnanabarathi

Police Station.   The Station House Officer registered a case in

Cr.No.56/15 for the offence punishable u/Sec.392 of <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_3">IPC</a>, and

submitted First Information Report to this Court.               After

investigation, Police Inspector, Jnanabarathi Police Station filed

charge sheet for the offence punishable u/Sec.392 of <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_4">IPC</a> against

the accused persons.    Hence, they have committed the alleged

offence.
                               3                           CC No.13195/16

3.   Accused    Nos.1 and 3 are on bail.       On receipt of charge

sheet, this court took the cognizance of the alleged offence and

furnished copy of the prosecution papers to the accused Nos.1

and 3.   But accused No.2         has not been secured.   Hence, this

case against the accused No.2 is split up.         After hearing on

charge, this Court has framed charge against accused Nos.1 and

3 for the offence punishable U/Sec.392 of <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_5">IPC</a> for which accused

pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.

4.   The prosecution, in order to prove its case, has examined 2

witnesses as PW.1 and PW.2 and got documents marked at Ex.P1

to Ex.P.4 and closed the side of the prosecution, and Statements

u/Sec.313 of <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_6">Cr.P.C</a>. are recorded, read over and explained in the

vernacular language of the accused No.1 and 3, wherein accused

have denied the incriminating circumstances appeared against

them as false and did not choose to lead defence evidence. Hence,

defence evidence is closed.       As such, the matter was posted for

arguments.
                              4                        CC No.13195/16

5.      I have heard the arguments on both sides.

6.       The PW.1, being the first informant deposed that on

04/02/2015 at about 11.00 a.m., when she was plucking flowers

in front of her house, one person came from her backside and

snatched her golden chain, and ran away, and another person was

in a bike, and they went in said bike, and she had not seen his

face, and neighbours came, as she shouted, and her son alsocame,

and thereafter she lodged the first information at Ex.P.1, and

police came to the spot and drawn Mahazar at Ex.P.2, and after 8

months, CCB police summoned her to station and shown golden

chain and one person, and his name has not stated and she

cannot identify the   said   person.   But she also stated that she

signed the Mahazar at Ex.P.2 in the spot.



7.   The PW.2, being the Mahazar witness, deposed that she

signed the Mahazar at Ex.P.2 in the spot, when police came to the

spot. But she stated that she does not know the contents of Ex.P.2.
                             5                         CC No.13195/16

8.   The PW.1 had stated that one person snatched her chain.

But she specifically stated that she could not identify the accused

persons. Moreover, other witnesses did not turn up in spite of

coercive steps. Hence, they were dropped by rejecting the prayer

of the   Learned Sr.APP.   There is no evidence to show that the

chain belonging to PW.1 has been seized from the possession of

accused persons and accused persons robbed her chain.          Hence,

the chain of evidence is not complete to establish that the said act

must have been done by accused       within all human possibility.

Thereby the chain of circumstances linking the accused remained

unproved. In the result, I am of the opinion that the prosecution

failed to prove the guilt of accused beyond all reasonable doubt.

Consequently, I proceed to pass the following:
