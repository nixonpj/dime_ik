                  besides suspicion, there is no allegation of overt act against

                  these petitioners. It is alleged in the written report that a day

                  prior to lodging the FIR, the son of the informant had gone out

                  of the house along with three other persons which was seen by

                  his daughter and did not return back. Thereafter, the informant

                  was informed that the dead body of his son was lying in the
 Patna High Court Cr.Misc. No.4701 of 2018(3) dt.27-02-2018
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                              2/3</span>




         Jethiyahi orchard. The informant has raised suspicion that about

         10-12 days prior to death of the son of the informant, some

         disputes had taken place between the deceased and one Raj

         Kishore@ Kari, who had assaulted his son (since deceased). The

         informant raised another suspicion for causing murder of his son

         that there was a quarrel with Laxmi Sah and Mithu Sah, in

         which his son assaulted them, thereafter, Mithu Sah and Raj

         Kumar Sah had come to the house of the informant and

         threatened to dire consequences.

         allowed and it is ordered that the petitioners, named above, in

         the event of their arrest or surrender in the court below within

         six weeks from the date of receipt/production of copy of this

         order, shall be released on bail on furnishing bail bonds of Rs.

         10,000/- (ten thousand) each with two sureties of the like

         amount each in connection with L.N.M.U. P.S. Case No. 257 of

         2017 to the satisfaction of the learned Chief Judicial Magistrate,

         Darbhanga, subject to condition as laid down u/S 438 (2) of the

                     absence on two consecutive dates without proper and reasonable

                     reason, will automatically cancel bail bonds of the petitioners
