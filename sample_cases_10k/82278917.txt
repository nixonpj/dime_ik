  BRIEF STATEMENT OF THE REASONS FOR THE DECISION
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                   2</span>

</p><p id="p_11">1.        Precisely, the case of the prosecution, is that, on

17/11/99, at 7.30 P.M, at shop no. 50/8, First floor, Yusuf Sarai, New

Delhi, within the jurisdiction of police station Defence Colony, the

accused persons in furtherance of their common intention gave

beatings to the complainant Dr. Satish Gupta and caused grievous

injuries on his body. The matter was reported to the police. Police

registered the case against the accused persons vide FIR No.

873/99, u/s 325/34 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_3">IPC</a>, PS Defence Colony. After investigations, the

charge sheet was filed against all the accused persons U/S 325/34

<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_4">IPC</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_12">

</p><p id="p_13">2.        The cognizance of the offence was taken. Copies of

charge sheet and other relevant documents were supplied to

them. Thereafter, they were heard on the point of charge through

their respective counsel. However, from the record, a prima facie

case for the offence U/S 325/34 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_5">IPC</a> was made out. Therefore,

charge was framed against all the accused persons on 9/4/02,

Under <a href="/doc/1133601/" id="a_6">Section 325</a>/<a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_7">34</a> IPC. The same was explained to the accused

persons to which they pleaded not guilty and claimed trial.



</p><p id="p_14">3.        The opportunity was given to the prosecution to lead

prosecution evidence. The prosecution examined D.Raja as PW-1,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                  3</span>

Dr. Satish Gupta the complainant/injured as PW-2 and HC Satya

Narain as PW-3. PW-1 has not supported the case of the

prosecution but the complainant PW-2 Dr. Satish Gupta has

supported the case of the prosecution against all the accused

persons. PW-3 HC Satya Narain is a formal witness as he has only

proved the fact of recording the formal FIR vide Ex PW3/A.



</p><p id="p_15">4.       The case is still at the stage of prosecution evidence. But

during the proceedings of the case, the matter has been

compromised between the parties.
</p>
<p id="p_16">

</p><p id="p_17">5.       Ld. Counsel on behalf of the complainant has submitted

today that all the matters pending between the parties have been

settled. Accused Raj Kumar Sharma on his behalf and on behalf of

other accused persons compensated the complainant and injured

Dr. Satish Gupta adequately. All the disputes between them have

been amicably settled with the intervention of the respectable

persons of the society. A request has been made by the accused

that permission may be granted u/s 320 (2) <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_8">Cr.P.C</a> to compound

the offence u/s 325 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_9">IPC</a> against all the accused persons.



</p><p id="p_18">6.       Keeping in view the aforesaid facts, the statement of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                 4</span>

complainant Dr. Satish Gupta was recorded separately. In view of

the statement of the complainant, it seems that the offence has

been compounded by the complainant voluntarily without any

force, coercion or undue influence from any corner and the

matters pending between the parties have also been settled.

Therefore, it seems that it is in the interest of justice to give

permission to the complainant Dr. Satish Gupta to compound the

offence u/s 325 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_10">IPC</a>. Hence, necessary permission is given to the

compound the offence as per the provision u/s 320 (2) <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_11">Cr.P.C</a>.



</p><p id="p_19">7.       In view of the aforesaid facts, all the accused persons

are acquitted for the offences u/s 325/34. Their bail bonds and

surety bonds are cancelled. Sureties are discharged. File be

consigned to record room after due compliance.</p><pre id="pre_2">

</p><p id="p_21">           The case is at the stage of prosecution. PW Sanjeev and
Manish Kumar, the injured and the complainant appeared in the
court.    They   stated   that   the       accused   persons   have   paid
compensation to them for their injuries. Therefore, they do not want
to pursue this case any further against the accused persons. They
have compounded the offences. The statement of Sanjeev Kumar
and Manish Kumar are recorded separately today i.e. 29/2/08.            In
view of the same, the prosecution evidence is closed.
</p><p id="p_22">           It is observed that offences u/s 323/341/34 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_12">IPC</a> are
