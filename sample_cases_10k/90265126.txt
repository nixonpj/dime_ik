                                   2


     THIS APPEAL COMING ON FOR HEARING THIS DAY, THE
COURT DELIVERED THE FOLLOWING:

                          JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">           The claimant has filed this appeal for enhancement of

compensation on the following two grounds:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">     I.      The Tribunal was not justified in attributing 25% of

             contributory negligence to claimant on the ground

             that he was drunk at the time of accident.

     II.     The compensation awarded by Tribunal under

             several heads is inadequate.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">
</blockquote><p id="p_2">2.         I have heard Sri M.R.Kumaraswamy, learned counsel

for claimant and Sri P.S.Kailash Shankar, learned counsel

for Insurance Company.
</p>
<p id="p_3">
</p><p id="p_4">3.         The Tribunal has held that claimant was drunk and he

was walking on the middle of road. The finding of Tribunal is

contrary to contents of rough sketch prepared by the

Investigating Officer, wherein it is shown that rider of

motorcycle was riding motorcycle on the off side of road. The

road near the place of accident runs in the direction of East
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                3</span>


to West. The rider of motorcycle was riding in the direction of

East to West. Therefore, rider of motorcycle should have

ridden motorcycle on southern half of road. The rider of

motorcycle was riding motorcycle on northern half of road.

The accident had taken place near junction of Banashankari

Outer    Ring   Road   and    BMTC    Depot      Road.    In   the

circumstances, Tribunal was not justified in holding that

claimant was guilty of contributory negligence to the extent

of 25%. Therefore, I hold that accident took place due to rash

and negligence of rider of motorcycle bearing No.KA-51-R-

4577.
</p>
<p id="p_5">
Regarding quantum of compensation:-

</p><p id="p_6">4.      The claimant has contended that he had suffered

fractures of both bones of right lower limb. The claimant has

not produced x-rays. He has not produced treatment

records. He has not examined the doctor, who treated him.

The claimant was rest contended with the production of

wound certificate. In view of sporadic evidence adduced by

claimant,    the   Tribunal   was    justified    in     awarding
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                 4</span>


compensation of Rs.92,000/-. There are no reasons to

interfere with this finding of Tribunal.


</p><p id="p_7">5.    In the result, I pass the following:-

</p><p id="p_8">                            ORDER

      The appeal is accepted in part. The impugned award is

modified. The claimant is entitled to compensation of

Rs.92,000/- with interest at 6% per annum from the date of

petition till the date of deposit. Respondents I &amp; II are jointly

and severally liable to pay compensation as asforestated. The

ratio of payment and investment is confirmed.
