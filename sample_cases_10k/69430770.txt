</p><p id="p_2">                           2. The brief facts of the case are as follows :
</p>
<p id="p_3">                           On 25.10.2001 at about 11.00 p.m., when the claimant was proceeding

                 in his Yamaha Motor Cycle on the left side of the Anangoor Road, at that time the

                 first respondent, who drove the Maruthi Car bearing Registration No.TAL-2323, on

                 the same direction in a rash and negligent manner, hit against the claimant and

                 caused grievous injuries over his head and multiple injuries all over the body. The

                 claimant has claimed a sum of Rs.7,00,000/- as compensation for the injuries

                 sustained by him and also for the disability, pain and suffering, loss of income and

                 medical expenses.
</p>
<p id="p_4">


</p><p id="p_5">                           3. The Insurance Company, in the counter statement, has stated that

                 there is no fault on the part of the first respondent and the accident was also

                 reported to police on 25.10.2001 by one Manickam, who did not identify the

                 accused. Hence, the said accident was not occurred due to hit by the said Car

                 bearing Registration No.TAL-2323. It is further stated that the claimant himself

                 had invited the accident by his careless and negligent driving, without following

                 the traffic rules. The other aspects, regarding the claim made by the claimant

                 under various heads, were also denied.
</p>
<p id="p_6">


</p><p id="p_7">                           4. The Tribunal, after analyzing the evidence and documents placed

                 before it, has given a finding that the accident occurred only due to the rash and

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                                           3</span>

            negligent driving on the part of the first respondent and awarded a sum of

            Rs.6,01,719/- as compensation under various heads as follows :

</p><pre id="pre_2">                                       Heads                    Sum Awarded by the
                                                                   Tribunal (Rs.)
                       For Loss of Income (1500*12*18)                        3,24,000.00
                       For pain and suffering                                   25,000.00
                       For Nourishment                                          15,000.00
                       For Transport expenses                                    1,000.00
                       For Medical expenses                                   2,36,719.00
                       TOTAL                                                 6,01,719.00


</pre><p id="p_8">            Aggrieved against the said award, the Insurance Company has preferred this
            appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_9">

</p><p id="p_10">                        5. In the grounds of appeal, the appellant/Insurance Company has raised

            the issue that the sum awarded by the Tribunal as compensation at Rs.6,01,719/-

            is highly excessive.       The further grievance raised by the appellant is that the

            accident was caused due to the rash and negligent driving on the part of the driver

            of the car, which aspect was not considered by the Tribunal. It is also the

            grievance of the appellant that the sum awarded by the Tribunal in respect of

            disability, medical expenses and pain and suffering were also highly excessive and

            without any basis.
</p>
<p id="p_11">


</p><p id="p_12">                        6. On a perusal of the records, it is seen that the claimant had sustained

            severe injuries especially, the head injury, which is very much observed from

                 Ex.P2-Wound
http://www.judis.nic.in        Certificate. Further, it is also very clear from the medical bills Ex.P7
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                                         4</span>

                 produced before the Tribunal that the claimant was under treatment as inpatient

                 for a long period from 27.11.2001      to 14.02.2002. Ex.P8-Permanent Disability

                 Certificate also reveals the fact that the claimant has sustained 60% permanent

                 disability, that apart of the head injury his memory power was very much

                 affected. It is also seen that due to the permanent disability sustained by the

                 claimant, he is unable to continue his business using powerlooms and his monthly

                 earning of Rs.10,000/- was also very much affected and incurred heavy loss of

                 income.
</p>
<p id="p_13">


</p><p id="p_14">                           7. On perusal of the award passed by the Tribunal, it is seen that the

                 Tribunal, after analysing the evidence and documents, nature of injury, etc., fixed

                 the monthly income at Rs.2,500/- and determined the loss of income by applying

                 proper multiplier and arrived at the sum at Rs.3,24,000/- which is very much

                 reasonable. Further, the sum awarded by the Tribunal under the head 'pain and

                 suffering' at Rs.25,000/- is also proper. By considering the period of treatment

                 and the inconvenience caused to the claimant/injured person due to his health

                 condition, the sum awarded for nourishment at Rs.15,000/- is justifiable.      The

                 sum awarded for transport expenses at Rs.1,000/- is also very much reasonable

                 and on the whole, the sum assessed by the Tribunal for determining the loss of

                 income and other relevant heads are very much reasonable and proper and hence

                 the award passed by the Tribunal does not require any interference, the award

                 passed by the Tribunal is confirmed.

</p><p id="p_16">                           8. In the result, the Civil Miscellaneous Appeal is dismissed. No costs.

                 Consequently, the connected Miscellaneous Petition is closed.




</p><p id="p_17">                           9. Accordingly, the appellant/Insurance Company is directed to deposit

                 the entire award passed by the Tribunal, with interest and costs as apportioned by

                 the Tribunal, after adjusting the amount, if any, already deposited, within a period

                 of four weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of this order. On such deposit

                 being made, the Tribunal is directed to transfer the claimant's bank accounts

                 through RTGS within one week thereon.
