is stated that petitioner as per directions of the Hon'ble High

when on earlier occasion petition was dismissed. It is stated
that now re-examination of Sh. R.D. Kashyap cannot be
allowed to fulfill the lacuna. The petitioner has to lead fresh

<p id="p_6">5.                The petitioner filed reply to the application and
taken preliminary objection that present application moved
without any justified reason and also not maintainable as per
provisions of CPC and Section 151 CPC is not applicable. It is
stated that respondent no.4 has not approached the court

direction is as under:

<p id="p_12">10.               The petitioner has been granted opportunity to
prove his case by leading fresh evidence in support of proof
of registered Will dated 31.07.1991 executed by deceased
Smt.Shanti Devi. Fundamental intention of the Hon'ble High
Court is that the evidence led earlier has not to be re-
examined but a denovo petitioner has to lead his evidence.
He is at liberty to call any witness but shall file fresh affidavit
of all the witnesses. I have gone through the cited judgment.
This is not of much help to the applicant because the facts in
hand are distinguishable as per cited judgment. Hence, the
application is allowed. Petitioner is directed to file fresh

application is disposed of accordingly.
