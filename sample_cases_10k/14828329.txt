      HARJEET SINGH                                  ..... Plaintiff
                         Through      Mr.Mohan Vidhani, Mr.Shish Singh
                                      &amp; Mr.Madan Mohan, Advs.

                         versus

      SATISH R NATHANI &amp; ORS                             ..... Defendants
                   Through

      CORAM:
      HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE JAYANT NATH

JAYANT NATH, J. (ORAL)
</pre>
<p id="p_1">1.    This suit is filed by the plaintiff seeking a decree of permanent
injunction to restrain the defendants, etc. from manufacturing, selling,
offering for sale or dealing in shirts and readymade garments, etc. under the
trade mark/label POLICE GUY'S or any other mark identical or deceptively
similar to the plaintiff's second trade mark GUY'S DANG. Other connected
reliefs are also sought regarding the two trademarks/label POLICE GUY'S
and GUY'S DANG.
</p><p id="p_2">2.    On 15.09.2014, this court noted that the defendants are served. It also
noted that learned counsel appearing for defendant No.3 was ready to give an
undertaking not to use the trade mark in question in future provided the
plaintiff would not press for costs, damages and rendition of accounts.
</p>



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">CS(COMM) 1055/2016                                          Page 1 of 5</span>
<p id="p_3"> Learned counsel appearing for the plaintiff left the issue to the court. This
court then directed defendant No.3 to give an undertaking to be filed within
four weeks from that date and also directed that the plaintiff would not press
for damages and costs under these circumstances. Defendant No. 3 has filed
an undertaking on 02.02.2015. Hence, the suit does not survive against
defendant No.3.
</p><p id="p_4">3.    As far as the other two defendants are concerned, namely, defendants
No. 1 and 2, this court on 21.08.2017 proceeded ex parte against them. The
said defendants have neither entered appearance not have they filed their
written statement.
</p><p id="p_5">4.    In the plaint, it is pleaded by the plaintiff that he is the owner being
subsequent proprietor of the distinctive trade mark and label POLICE
GUY'S in respect of clothing and headgear which trade mark and label are in
use since 15.03.2005. The said trade mark/label was initially adopted by the
predecessor of the plaintiff, namely, Mr. Trilochan Singh in the year 2005.
The predecessor had filed an application for registration of the said trade
mark in Class 25 in respect of clothing and headgear. The said application is
pending on account of opposition from a third party which is being contested
by the plaintiff. The predecessor of the plaintiff assigned the said trade mark
in favour of the plaintiff by virtue of an Assignment Deed dated 15.12.2011.
Thereafter, the plaintiff has used the trade mark. A request to bring on record
the plaintiff as a subsequent proprietor of the said application has also been
filed with the office of Registry of Trade Marks. It is also pleaded that the
predecessor of the plaintiff also registered the trade mark GUY'S DANG
(Label) dated 24.05.2006. The said registration was valid up to 24.05.2016.
The said trade mark was also assigned in favour of the plaintiff by virtue of




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">CS(COMM) 1055/2016                                            Page 2 of 5</span>
 an Assignment Deed dated 02.04.2012. The application for registering the
plaintiff as a subsequent proprietor has also been accepted by the Registry of
Trade Marks.
</p><p id="p_6">5.     It is further pleaded that the plaintiff has filed applications for
registration of the trademarks POLICE GUY'S (words), POLICE SPORT,
POLICE GOLD, LIMITED GUY'S and PETER JEANS. The applications
are said to be pending. It is also pleaded that the plaintiff is the owner and
proprietor of the registered trademarks in Thailand, namely, POLICE
GUY'S (Label), POLICE JEANS GUY'S , etc. as detailed in the plaint.
</p><p id="p_7">6.     Hence, it is the case of the plaintiff that the trademarks have acquired
distinctive character and are capable of distinguishing goods sold and
manufactured by the plaintiff. The plaintiff is also said to be the owner of the
copyright and artistic labels of the marks mentioned and is the registered
owner of the copyright in the label. Hence, it is pleaded that the plaintiff has
the sole and exclusive right to use the said trade marks/label/trade dress, etc.
Reliance is also placed on various suits filed by the plaintiff which are
pending adjudication where interim orders have been passed in favour of the
plaintiff.
</p><p id="p_8">7.     It is pleaded that sometimes in the third week of July 2014, the
plaintiff came to know that defendant No.1 and 2 are manufacturing and
marketing goods being readymade garments under the identical trade mark
POLICE GUY'S written in identical manner with identical colour scheme as
that of the plaintiff. Defendants No. 1 and 2 are said to be marketing, selling
their goods in Delhi through defendant No.3. It is also stated that the
defendants have taken the words GUY'S in the impugned trade mark/label
which is a part of the registered trade mark of the plaintiff as detailed above




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">CS(COMM) 1055/2016                                            Page 3 of 5</span>
 and infringed the trade mark GUY'S DANG (Label). Hence, the present
suit.
</p><p id="p_9">8.      The plaintiff has filed the evidence of PW-1/Sh.Trilochan Singh who
reiterated the submissions as stated in the plaint. He has exhibited the
assignment deed dated 15.12.2011 as EX.PW-1/2 and supplementary
assignment deed as Ex.PW-1/3. Copies of the applications filed before the
Trade marks Registry have been exhibited as PW-1/9 to PW-1/12. The
copies of the trade mark registration certificates of the plaintiff in Thailand
with their English translation are exhibited as Ex.PW-1/13 to PW-1/22.
</p><p id="p_10">9.      Even otherwise, the defendants No. 1 and 2 have not filed any written
statement. The pleas of the plaintiff are uncontested.
</p><p id="p_11">10.     The Supreme Court in the case of <a href="/doc/127697258/" id="a_1">S.Syed Mohideen vs. P. Sulochana
Bai</a>, (2016) 2 SCC 683 on the issue of passing off noted as follows:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">        "31.1 Traditionally, passing off in common law is considered to
        be a right for protection of goodwill in the business against
        misrepresentation caused in the course of trade and for prevention
        of resultant damage on account of the said misrepresentation. The
        three ingredients of passing off are goodwill, misrepresentation
        and damage. These ingredients are considered to be classical
        trinity under the law of passing off as per the speech of Lord
        Oliver laid down in the case of Reckitt &amp; Colman Products Ltd. v.
        Borden Inc: (1990) 1 AllE.R. 873 which is more popularly known
        as "Jif Lemon" case wherein the Lord Oliver reduced the five
        guidelines laid out by Lord Diplock in Erven Warnink v. Townend
        &amp; Sons Ltd. [1979) AC 731, 742 (HL)] (the "Advocate Case") to
        three elements: (1) Goodwill owned by a trader, (2)
        Misrepresentation and (3) Damage to goodwill. Thus, the passing
        off action is essentially an action in deceit where the common law
        rule is that no person is entitled to carry on his or her business on
        pretext that the said business is of that of another. This Court has
        given its imprimatur to the above principle in the case of




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">CS(COMM) 1055/2016                                             Page 4 of 5</span>
        <a href="/doc/185380767/" id="a_2">Laxmikant V. Patel</a> v. Chetanbhat Shah and Anr.: 2002 (2) R.C.R.
       (Civil) 357 : (2002) 3 SCC 65."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_12">11.    It is quite clear that on account of a prior user of the trade mark
POLICE GUY'S and the goodwill generated by the plaintiff on account of
extensive user, the plaintiff has common law rights in the said trade mark.
The action of defendants No.1 and 2 in trying to sell garments, cloth, etc.
using the said trade mark is clearly in violation of the rights of the plaintiff.
Similarly, the trade mark GUY'S DANG is a registered trade mark and
violation of the said trade mark by defendants No. 1 and 2 is in breach of the
statutory rights.
</p><p id="p_13">12.    Accordingly, the suit is decreed in favour of the plaintiff and against
defendants No. 1 and 2 in terms of prayer 25(a), (b) and (c) of the plaint.
The plaintiff shall also be entitled to costs.
</p><p id="p_14">13.    The suit stands disposed of.
</p>



<p id="p_15">                                                      (JAYANT NATH)
