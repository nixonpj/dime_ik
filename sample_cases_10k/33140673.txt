accused   No.1   filed   a   petition   before   the   High   Court   u/s.9   of   the   Arbitration   &amp; 
<a href="/doc/1306164/" id="a_1">Conciliation Act</a>, being OMP No.696/2009 seeking the relief/s sought therein. The 
accused   had   specifically   quantified   the   total   amounts   it   claimed   and   also 
mentioned   about   the   equipments,   furniture,   fittings,   fixtures,   etc.   in   the   said

CC No. 54/1/14
Mehra Jewel Palace Pvt. Ltd. Vs. Aryan Life Style Pvt. Ltd. &amp; Ors.
                                                  3

handed   over   the   said   stocks   to   Reebok   India   Limited   for   a   consideration.     It 
further annexed a photograph as Annexure A/27 in OMP696/09 alleging the set 
up   of   the   premises   as   on   the   close   of   31.07.2009,   and   certified   the   said 
photograph as a true copy.  The photograph showed the store/showroom stocked 
with inventory.  In Paragraphs 1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 9, 14, 15, 43, 46, 47, 48, 49, and 56 of  
its Reply to the Preliminary Objections of the Respondent in OMP 696 of 2009, </pre>
<p id="p_1">accused reiterated that its stocks were in the showroom at the close of business 
on 31.7.2009, the Respondent prevented it from removing the stocks, and handed 
over   the   stocks   to   Reebok   for   a   consideration.    The   rejoinder   in   OMP   No. 
696/2009 bears the signatures of accused No.4 at point X4, X5, X6 and X7 who 
has   been   authorized   by  the   Board  of   Directors  of   accused   No.1   consisting   of 
accused   No.2   and   No.3.  However   in   paragraph   I   ii)   of   its   statement   of   claim 
before the Arbitral Tribunal, accused No.1 admitted that the Claimant i.e. accused 
No.1 had removed its stock from the showroom at the close of July 31, 2009.  The 
photograph submitted by accused No.1 as Annexure A/27 in OMP No.696 of 2009 
is a forged and fabricated document and was made dishonestly and fraudulently 
to defraud the complainant and to cause wrongful loss to the complainant.   The 
Statement   of   Claim   bears   the   signatures   of   accused   No.4   who   has   been 
authorized by the Board of Directors of accused No.1 consisting of accused No.2 
and No.3.
</p>

<p id="p_2">7.          A claim of Rs.65,12,845/­ was raised by accused no.1 in its Statement 
of   Claim   filed   before   Arbitral   Tribunal   on   account   of   fixed   assets   that   the 
complainant   allegedly   prevented   it   from   removing   from   the   premises   after 
31.7.2009.   Accused No.1 submitted numerous accounts, pertaining to the said 
alleged fixed assets, to justify the said claim of Rs.65,12,845/­.   In the balance 
sheet dated 31.3.2010 filed by Accused No.1 with the Registrar of Companies, 
Ministry of Corporate Affairs, it is shown that it sold off all of its fixed assets and 
the balance of its fixed assets as on 31.3.2010 is nil.  As per the disclosure in its

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                                  4</span>

<p id="p_3">balance sheet, it sold off its assets vide an agreement dated August 28, 2009, 
which was effected from May 2009, to M/s Primus Sports Pvt. Ltd.  The Balance 
Sheet was signed by accused No.2, No.3, No.4 and No.6. 
</p>

<p id="p_4">8.          Accused No.1 submitted before the High Court in OMP No.696/2009 
that   it   had   a   claim   of   Rs.48,00,000/­   towards   refund   of   security   deposit   from 
Complainant.   In its reply, Complainant submitted to the High Court that as per 
the account of Complainant in the books of accused no.1, there was a full and 
final settlement and the balance in the account was nil. 
</p>

<p id="p_5">9.          In order to substantiate its claim of Rs.48,00,000/­, accused persons in 
criminal conspiracy with each other fabricated a statement of the alleged Security 
Deposit (Nike) account showing a balance outstanding of Rs 48,00,000/­ as on 
31.3.2009 and filed the same on behalf of accused No.1 along with the rejoinder 
in OMP No.696/2009. This statement is clearly a forged and fabricated document 
and has been made dishonestly and fraudulently with an intention to defraud the 
complainant and to cause wrongful loss to the complainant.
</p>

<p id="p_6">10.         Accused   No.1  Aryan   Lifestyle   also   submitted   before   the   Arbitral 
Tribunal a statement of Complainant's account showing a full and final settlement 
of the account with a 'nil' balance. The alleged Security Deposit (Nike) account is 
a forged and fabricated document prepared by accused No.2 to No.6 on behalf of 
accused No.1 in criminal conspiracy with each other. This is evident from the fact 
that   the   last   entry   in   the   account   of   Complainant   Company   in   the   books   of 
accused No.1 is a debit entry of Rs.3,35,000/­, against full and final settlement, 
from the Security Deposit account.  In accordance with double entry book­keeping 
practices,   a   corresponding   credit   entry   of   Rs.3,35,000/­   should   appear   in   the 
Security   Deposit   (Nike)   account.     The   fact   that   there   is   no   credit   entry   of 
Rs.3,35,000/­   in   the   Security   Deposit   (Nike)   account,   makes   is   clear   that   the

<p id="p_7">alleged Security Deposit (Nike) account is a forged, fabricated and manipulated 
statement   of   account   which   has   been   subsequently   forged   by   the   accused 
persons after the complainant filed its reply to the OMP No.696/2009.
</p>

<p id="p_8">11.         The   alleged   Security   Deposit   (Nike)   account   submitted   by   Accused 
No.1  before   the   Arbitral  Tribunal   shows  a   balance   of   Rs.48,00,000/­   due   from 
Complainant.     However,   the   letter   dated   31.07.2009   states   that   the   balance 
security deposit is Rs.43,65,000/­.   The alleged Security Deposit (Nike) account 
submitted by accused No.1 is clearly a forged and fabricated document and has 
been   made   dishonestly   and   fraudulently   with   an   intention   to   defraud   the 
complainant company and to cause wrongful loss to the complainant. 
</p>

<p id="p_9">12.         As per the Balance Sheet as on 31.3.2010, submitted by Accused No.1 
with   the   Registrar   of   Companies,   Ministry   of   Corporate   Affairs,   the   alleged 
security   deposit   amount   recoverable   from   complainant   is   Rs.48,61,056/­.     The 
alleged   Security   Deposit   (Nike)   account   showing   a   balance   of   Rs.48,00,000/­ 
submitted by accused persons is thus clearly a forged and fabricated document.
</p>

<p id="p_10">13.         Accused No.2 to No.4 on behalf of accused No.1 submitted before the 
Arbitral   Tribunal   a   certificate   issued   by   its   Chartered   Accountant   Mr.   Umesh 
Gupta, accused No.5, certifying that as per the books of accounts of accused 
No.1,   an   amount   of   Rs.48,00,000/­   is   due   from   the   Complainant.     However, 
accused No.6 Mr. Ajay Sachdeva, the Chartered Accountant of accused No.1 has 
certified   in   the   balance   sheet   dated   31.3.2010   that   the   security   deposit 
recoverable is Rs.48,61,065/­. Thus the Chartered Accountant Certificate issued 
by accused No.5 and submitted by accused No.2 to No.4 on behalf of accused 
No.1 is a forged and fabricated certificate and has been made dishonestly and 
fraudulently with an intention to defraud the complainant and to cause wrongful 
loss to it. Further all the accused persons including the Chartered Accountant, in

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                                6</span>

<p id="p_11">furtherance   of   their   criminal   conspiracy   have   forged   the   said   Chartered 
Accountant   Certificate   which   they   have   subsequently   used   as   a   genuine 
document. 
</p>

<p id="p_12">14.         All the three documents i.e. Balance Sheet of accused No.1 Company 
as on 31.3.2010,  Letter dated 31.07.2009 and  Chartered Accountant Certificate 
show   different   amounts   for   the   alleged   Security   Deposit   i.e.  Rs.48,61,056/­, 
Rs.43,65,000/­ and Rs.48,00,000/­ respectively. On the other hand the account of 
Complainant in the books of accused No.1 shows a full and final settlement of the 
account   with   a   'nil'   balance.  The   above   facts   and   documents   show   that   the 
accused persons have been fabricating and forging the documents as per their 
convenience and requirement.
</p>

<p id="p_13">15.         Accused   No.1   submitted   before   the   Arbitral   Tribunal   Claims   totalling 
Rs.1,13,12,845/­.  However, as per the Balance Sheet as on 31.3.2010, submitted 
by   accused   No.2   to   No.4   on   behalf   of   accused   No.1   with   the   Registrar   of 
Companies,   Ministry   of   Company   Affairs,   the   amount   recoverable   is 
Rs.48,61,065/­.  The claims of Rs.1,13,12,845/­ are fraudulent, and the documents 
submitted by accused No.1 in support of the claims are false. 
</p>

<p id="p_14">16.         The   Chartered   Accountant   Certificate   submitted   by   accused   No.1 
before the Arbitral Tribunal, states that accused No.1 did not maintain a security 
deposit account in the name of Complainant  Company, but showed the security 
deposits given by accused No.1 Aryan Lifestyle to the different landlords of Nike 
Shops in one Security Deposit (Nike) account.  As per the Balance Sheet as on 
31.3.2010   submitted   by   accused   No.1   before   the   Registrar   of   Companies,  the 
balance in the security deposit account is Rs.92,13,254/­. The Security Deposit 
(Nike) account submitted by accused No.1 does not reflect any security deposits 
to any other landlords and nor does the balance of Rs.48,00,000/­ tally with the

<p id="p_15">amount of Rs.92,13,254/­ declared in the balance sheet.   The Security Deposit 
(Nike) account submitted by accused persons on behalf of accused No.1 is clearly 
a forged and fabricated document.
</p>

<p id="p_16">17.        The   Chartered   Accountant   Certificate   submitted   by   accused   No.1 
states   that   the   security   deposit   of   Rs.48,00,000/­   does   not   appear   in   any 
individual   account   of   Complainant,   but   the   same   has   been   accounted   in   the 
Security Deposits Shops (Nike) account as a part of the total security deposit 
placed by the accused No.1 with land lords of their various Nike outlets. However 
at   the  same  time  an  individual   account   of   Complainant  has   been  filed  by  the 
accused.  If that's the position then the statement of the Security Deposit (Nike) 
account filed by accused persons on behalf of accused No.1 is also a forged and 
fabricated document.
</p>

<p id="p_17">18.        All the above documents have been intentionally forged by the accused 
No.2 to 6 on behalf of accused No.1 in criminal conspiracy with each other to 
defraud the complainant, to raise a false claim and to cause the wrongful loss to 
the complainant company and wrongful gain to the accused persons. The order of 
the   Hon'ble   High   Court   dated   16.09.2010   passed   in   OMP   No.696/2009   also 
makes it very clear that although the accused No.1 had claimed the amount of 
Rs.48 lacs   but they were not in a position to provide any details for the said 
claim. The said order further shows that the accused had taken a stand contrary 
to their documents i.e. the Balance Sheet which had been created on 19.08.2010 
and had come into existence at the time of the passing of the said order of the 
Hon High Court on 16.09.2010.

<p id="p_18">19.        The   accused   persons   have   wilfully   and   with   intent   to   defraud   the 
complainant   company   altered   the   account   books   and   have   filed   forged   and 
fabricated account statements and have also thus committed the offence under

<p id="p_19">the  relevant   section  of   <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_3">IPC</a>.  Sh.   Chand  Mehra  was  examined   as  CW1   by  the 
complainant in its pre­summoning evidence.
</p>

<p id="p_20">20.      I   have   heard   the   AR   of   the   complainant   and   the   counsel   for   the 
complainant, perused the record and have gone through the relevant provisions of 
the law.
</p>

<p id="p_21">21.      In order to decide whether a process should or should not be issued, the 
Magistrate   has   to   consider   whether   the   complaint   discloses   all   the   essential 
ingredients   of   an   offence.   If   the   complaint   does   not   disclose   any   essential 
ingredient of an offence, that will be a case where the complaint, taken on its face 
value, does not make out any case for issue of a process. Where, however, the 
allegations   disclose   the   essential   ingredients   but   are   patently   absurd   and 
inherently improbable so that no prudent person can ever reach a conclusion that 
there   is   sufficient   ground   for   proceeding   against   an   accused,   then   also   the 
complaint has to be rejected. Where the complaint does not suffer from any such 
defect   but  the  evidence  is  such  as  not  to amount   to  any  legal  evidence   or   is 
inherently improbable, then also the issue of process would be an abuse of the 
process of the Court. The issue of process under<a href="/doc/1306164/" id="a_4"> S. 204</a> or dismissal of complaint 
under  <a href="/doc/1306164/" id="a_5"> S.   203</a>   is   a   matter   for   judicial   determination   and   where   the   order 
summoning the accused does not show application of mind of the Magistrate and 
discusses   no   evidence,   the   order,   not   being   a   speaking   order,   is   liable   to   be 
quashed. To be valid, the order summoning an accused should not be capricious 
or arbitrary. 
</p>

<p id="p_22">22.      At this juncture it is worthwhile to discuss the relevant provisions under 
consideration, which are as under:
