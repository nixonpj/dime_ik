<pre id="pre_1">              The High Court of Madhya Pradesh

                Criminal Revision No.1828/2019
              (Santosh @ Shubham Vs. State of M.P. )
                                1
Jabalpur, Dated : 20-8-2019
     Shri Ravi Dwivedi, counsel for the petitioner.
     Shri Gulab Singh, P.L., for the respondent/State.</pre>
<p id="p_1">     Heard.
</p><p id="p_2">     This criminal revision under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_1">section 397</a>/<a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_2">401</a> of the
Code of Criminal Procedure is directed against order dated
13.3.2019, passed by Special Judge, <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_3">NDPS Act</a>, Katni in
Crime No.95/2019, whereby application under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_4">section 457</a>
of Cr.P.C., filed by the petitioner was dismissed.
</p><p id="p_3">     The case of the prosecution is that on 4.2.2019 the
Police party of Police Station Kuthla, District Katni got the
information that two boys are coming from Vijayraghavgarh
side by motor cycle bearing registration No.MP 19/MU 6896
having Ganja in their possession.            The police party
intercepted them and seized 6 kgs of Ganja from their
possession, which was kept in a black bag. Offence
punishable under <a href="/doc/704277/" id="a_5">Sections 8</a>/<a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_6">20-B</a> of the NDPS Act was
registered against the petitioner and co-accused person.
</p><p id="p_4">     Petitioner Santosh @ Shubham, who is a registered
owner of the aforesaid vehicle, moved an application under
<a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_7">Section 457</a> of the Cr.P.C. in the Court of Special Judge,
<a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_8">NDPS Act</a>, Katni for releasing the aforesaid vehicle. The
learned Special Judge dismissed the application under
<a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_9">Section 457</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure vide order
dated 13.3.2019. Against the said order, the petitioner has
preferred this Criminal Revision.
</p><p id="p_5">     Learned counsel appearing for the petitioner has
contended that the learned Special Judge, while passing the
impugned order has failed to exercise the jurisdiction vested
               The High Court of Madhya Pradesh

                Criminal Revision No.1828/2019
              (Santosh @ Shubham Vs. State of M.P. )
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                2</span>
with him and committed grave error of law in holding that
the aforesaid property cannot be given on Supurdnama, as
it is involved in a serious offence. It is further submitted
that if the seized vehicle is kept for a long time in open
space, it will be damaged due to the effect of weather
conditions.
</p><p id="p_6">     In support of the aforesaid contention, he has placed
reliance to the order passed by this Court dated 24.09.2018
in the case of Prakash Vishwakarma Vs. State of M.P
and another (M.Cr.C.No.33134/2018) and order of a
Coordinate Bench of         this Court passed in         M.Cr.C.
No.16947/2017, dated 26.09.2018.
</p><p id="p_7">     Learned Panel Lawyer for the respondent/State
opposed the application on the ground that the vehicle
which is seized for the offence, is of serious nature.
</p><p id="p_8">     Provisions of <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_10">Section 457</a> of Criminal Procedure Code
provides power to the Court to pass an appropriate order
for interim custody and for disposal of seized property in
pending trial where the property is subjected to natural
decay and looking to the other circumstances, to the owner
of the property. No fruitful purpose will be served by
retaining the vehicle during pendency of the trial or during
confiscation proceedings, rather it will diminish the value of
the said vehicle, when the applicant is ready to produce the
vehicle as and when called by above mentioned authorities,
then certainly the vehicle concerned can be given in the
interim custody of the registered owner. When the vehicle
concerned not kept in the secured place i.e. garage there is
              The High Court of Madhya Pradesh

               Criminal Revision No.1828/2019
             (Santosh @ Shubham Vs. State of M.P. )
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                3</span>
every possibility of it being damaged by vagaries of
weather.
</p><p id="p_9">     On going through the case diary, it does not appear
that any proceeding of confiscation regarding the aforesaid
motor cycle has been started by the concerning authorities.
</p><p id="p_10">     On a perusal of copy of the registration certificate filed
by the petitioner, it is clear that he is the registered owner
of Pulsar Motor Cycle bearing registration No.MP 19/MU
6896 and he is thus entitled to get the aforesaid vehicle in
his temporary custody.
</p><p id="p_11">     Thus, the learned Court below has committed grave
error in dismissing the application of the petitioner under
<a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_11">Section 457</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which has
resulted in substantial loss to the petitioner, therefore, it
would be in the interest of justice to release the vehicle on
Supurdnama.
</p><p id="p_12">     Keeping in view the facts and circumstances of the
case, this revision is allowed and the order dated 13.3.2019,
passed by Special Judge, <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_12">NDPS Act</a>, Katni in Crime
No.95/2019 is hereby quashed. It is further directed that
the seized vehicle Pulsar Motor Cycle bearing registration
No.MP 19/MU 6896 be released in interim custody of
petitioner on furnishing a personal bond in the sum of
Rs.50,000/- (Rupees fifty thousand only) with a
solvent surety of the like amount to the satisfaction of the
trial Court for complying with following conditions :-
