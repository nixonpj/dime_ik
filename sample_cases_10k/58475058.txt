                  situated at village Duggal Kalan, Tehsil Samana, District

                  Patiala. It was maintained that plaintiffs had purchased a land

                  measuring 72 kanals from defendants No.3 &amp; 4, Babu and

                  Bittu sons of Chatin Kaur daughter of Narinder Kaur vide sale

                  deed dated 20.10.2004, along with a motor connection in

                  question that was running in the name of defendant No.3.

                  Defendant No.4, being the attorney of defendant No.3, had

                  also executed an affidavit of an even date for transfer of the

                  motor connection in the names of the plaintiffs. Plaintiffs also

                  purchased a land measuring 64 kanals 0 marla from

                  defendant No.4 and his brother Gurpal Singh vide another

                  sale deed dated 25.11.2004. And, mutations pursuant to these

                  sale deeds have since been sanctioned in favour of the

                  plaintiffs.     Since then, plaintiffs have continuously been

                  irrigating their fields with the aid of motor connection in

                  question, as they had no other source of irrigation. For, during

                  the pendency of the suit, motor connection was disconnected,

                  plaintiffs amended the plaint and also prayed for a decree for

                  mandatory injunction, directing defendants No.1 &amp; 2 to

                  connection. And, thus, defendant No.4 had no right to execute

                  the affidavit dated 20.04.2005. Gurtej Singh was alleged to

                  have obtained the power of attorney from defendant No.3 by

                  fraud and subsequently, the alleged power of attorney was

                  revoked on 13.07.2005.

<p id="p_7">                               On a due and thoughtful consideration of the

                  matter in issue, and the evidence on record, both the courts

                  concurrently concluded that the plaintiffs purchased a land

                  measuring 72 kanals, pursuant to a registered sale deed dated

                  20.10.2004 (Ex.P9) along with the motor connection in

                  question. Sale deed (Ex.P9) was executed by defendant No.4,

                  who was not only the son of defendant No.3 but also her duly

                  constituted attorney, vide power of attorney dated 11.10.2004

                  (Ex.P7). Gurtej Singh-defendant No.4 had also executed an

                  affidavit dated 20.10.2004 (Ex.P3), in favour of the plaintiffs,

                  attested by the Executive Magistrate, Patran, to transfer the

                  connection in favour of the plaintiffs. Although, defendant

                  No.3 revoked the power of attorney (Ex.P7), subsequent to the

                  execution of the sale deed, on 13.07.2005, but the sale deed

                  dated 20.10.2004, was never questioned. Gurtej Singh, who

                  was arrayed as defendant No.4 in the suit, did not choose to

                  contest the proceedings. Thus, execution of the sale deed

                  (Ex.P9) and affidavit dated 20.10.2014 (Ex.P3) remained

                  uncontroverted. Though, defendant No.3 had denied the

                  result of fraud, but strangely in a suit filed by defendant No.4-

                  Gurtej       Singh i.e. Civil   Suit No.229   of 20.07.2005, in

                  replication (Ex.P26), execution of sale deed dated 25.11.2004

                  (Ex.P11) as also the sale deed dated 20.10.2004 (Ex.P9) in

                  favour of the plaintiffs, was duly conceded. Though, defendant

                  No.4 and his brother Gurpal Singh (appellant) had denied to

                  have sold even the motor connection. Not just that, evidence

                  on record revealed that the plaintiffs had completed all the

                  formalities to get the motor connection transferred in their

                  favour. Indemnity bonds (Ex.P6) were duly executed in this

                  regard. And, receipt (Ex.P16) showed that even the transfer fee

                  stood deposited. However, instead of transferring the motor

                  connection in favour of the plaintiffs, defendants No.1 &amp; 2

                  rather ordered disconnection. That being so, defendant No.3

                  was estopped by her own conduct from raising any objection

                  as regards formal transfer of motor connection in the names of

                  the plaintiffs. Likewise, she had no locus to get the said

                  connection disconnected on the basis of a Panchayatnama

                  dated 28.06.2005 (Ex.D1).        That being so, it was concluded

                  that the entire exercise as regards disconnection was resorted

                  to by the official defendants in collusion with defendants No.3

                  &amp; 4, for extraneous consideration, to the detriment of the

                  plaintiffs. Evidence on record showed that since the date of

                  purchase of the land, plaintiffs have been irrigating their fields

                  with the aid of the motor connection in question. All the

                  receipts/electricity bills, Ex.P16 to Ex.P25, all this while, were

                  paid by the plaintiffs. Thus, plaintiffs were held entitled to the

                  decree for permanent injunction, as also a decree for

                  mandatory injunction, directing defendants No.1 &amp; 2 to

                  courts below and rejected after a due and comprehensive

                  consideration. It could not be pointed out as to how the

                  conclusions that had concurrently been recorded by both the

                  courts were either contrary to the position on record or

                  suffered from any material illegality. No other argument was
