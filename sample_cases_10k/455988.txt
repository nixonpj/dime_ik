<p id="p_1">Raman, J.
</p>
<p id="p_2">      Petitioner challenges the order Ext.P3 passed by the Family Court,

Thodupuzha, in I.A. Nos. 453/2007 &amp; 454/2007 in O.P. 67/2006.

</p><p id="p_3">      2. I.A. NO. 454/2007 was an application for restoration of O.P.

67/2006. Since there was some delay caused in filing the said application,

I.A. 453/2007 was also moved for condoning such delay.            O.P. 67/2006

was filed by the wife for return of share amount and gold ornaments, which

happened to be dismissed for default. Later, the present applications were

filed. The court below, after considering the materials on record, by Ext.P3

common order, condoned the delay and allowed restoration. Thus, the

original petition stood restored to file so that both sides have an opportunity

to contest the matter.
</p>
<p id="p_4">      3.    According to the counsel for the petitioner, the restoration

application    was signed by the party herself whereas the petition for

condonation of delay and the supporting affidavit are signed by her Power

WP(C) 29372/2008                      :2:
</p>
<p id="p_5">of Attorney Holder , who is none other than her father.

</p><p id="p_6">      4. We have gone through the applications which are produced in this

writ petition as Exts.P1 and P2 respectively. We find that the restoration

application was filed by the petitioner in the main petition in the Embassy

and dated 15th July, 2007 whereas the application for condonation of delay

is signed by the Power of Attorney Holder. We have gone through the

affidavit filed in support of the delay petition which would evidently show

that the delay occurred mainly because of the reason attributable on the part

of the Power of Attorney Holder. It is stated that though instructions were

given to seek restoration, because of the ill-health of the Power of Attorney

Holder, he could not file the same immediately which resulted in the delay.

Thus, the circumstances under which the delay caused are satisfactorily

explained in the affidavit. We find the proper person to explain the delay is

the Power of Attorney Holder. Hence there is nothing wrong in the

affidavit being filed by him. The restoration application was signed by the

party herself, she being the person aggrieved by the order declaring her ex

parte.     Thus, we find no illegality in the restoration application and

affidavit filed in support thereof being signed by the party herself and the

affidavit filed along with the delay petition       signed by the Power of

Attorney Holder.
</p>
<p id="p_7">WP(C) 29372/2008                        :3:
</p>
<p id="p_8">       5. Nextly, it was contended that Section 151 of the Code was

invoked for seeking restoration of the matter. Placing reliance on a Single

Bench decision of this Court in <a href="/doc/112358/" id="a_1">Velayudhan Nair v. Kerala K.Y. Kuries (P)

Ltd</a>. (1987(2) KLT 449)            it is contended that when there are other

provisions in the Code of Civil procedure, Section 151 ought not have been

invoked.
</p>
<p id="p_9">       6. We have gone through the decision and found that what is held in

that decision is that in case there is a specific provision, the power under

Section 151 of the Code can not be exercised to over-ride the said

provision. In this case, it is not shown that application for restoration now

filed is in any way barred by any of the other provisions contained in the

Code of Civil Procedure. If so, the mere fact that the application for

restoration is filed under Section 151 of the Code by itself is no reason to

hold that the same is in any way illegal. After all, in a matrimonial dispute

between the parties, when a petition for return of gold ornaments etc. is

filed, it is for the court to consider whether the default was deliberate and if

the court, on analysis of the materials on record, comes to the conclusion

that the default is not deliberate and there is no willful negligence or laches

on the part of the parties, it is always open to the court to consider such

application favourably and condone the delay in filing the same.
