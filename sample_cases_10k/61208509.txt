MAC.APP. 23/2017 &amp; CM No. 7411/2017

</p><p id="p_5">1.     The award of compensation for injury suffered by respondent no.1 in
a motor vehicle accident has been impugned on the ground that the
evidence does not support the liability for the same fixed on the appellant.
Referring to the Detailed Accident Report (DAR), the Site Plan of the
accident and the evidence filed by the respondent, the learned counsel for
the appellant submits that in the first instance, the version of the injured was
that he had parked his motorcycle on the side of the road where his friend,
who was a pillion rider, had stayed back and the claimant had crossed over
to the other side of the road for some work, but on the way back he was hit
by the offending motor cycle.
</p>



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">MAC.APP. 23/2017                                                   Page 1 of 13</span>
<p id="p_6"> 2.     The accident happened about two years ago on 01.06.2015 at 9.40 in
the morning during the peak traffic rush. The DAR records that: i) the
offending vehicle was not over speeding; ii) that the victim was taken to the
hospital by his friend Mr. Rajiv Kr. Jha; iii) the brief description of the
accident is: the victim was crossing the road when the offending vehicle hit
him on the road; iv) that the accident happened at a place where there was
no zebra crossing; v) that the offending vehicle was not being driven
dangerously or at excessive speed i.e. it was within permissible speed limits
and as a corollary, in the correct lane; and vi) that the vehicle was not
poorly maintained. As to whether the offending vehicle was not observing
traffic rules, or was parked on the wrong side or at a prohibited place, the
DAR records in the negative. The column for recording the name of
witness of the accident, the DAR does not record anything.
</p>
<p id="p_7">3.     The learned counsel for the respondent states that mere fact that the
offending vehicle was on the road without insurance is sufficient proof that
it was not being driven as per the traffic rules. However, there is nothing
on record to show that mere violation of a traffic rule linked the offending
vehicle to the accident and resultant injury.
</p>
<p id="p_8">4.     The learned counsel for the appellant argues that although the claim
petition stated that Mr. Rajiv Kr. Jha was the pillion rider, but in his
deposition on 04.02.2016, the respondent stated as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">           "....... It is correct that I used to go to office alongwith
           Rajeev Kumar Jha. It is correct that my friend was also
           having vehicle. My vehicle no. is DL9SK3707 (2012 model).
           When I was on leave, then my friend go to his office by his
           own vehicle. I am working with FNB Control since 1996.
           The distance between the residence of my friend Rajeev
           Kumar from my house is about 10 minutes. I do not


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">MAC.APP. 23/2017                                                Page 2 of 13</span>
            remember the exact time taken to reach the spot. I was going
           towards Prahlad Pur at the time of the accident. I was in
           possession of a mobile phone at that time. I had looked on
           the right and left side before trying to cross the road. The
           accident had taken place on the side of the road. The bike
           had hit me from the left side. I do not remember on which
           side I had fallen after the hit by the motorcycle. No friend of
           mine was present at the spot. I was unconscious for a short
           while after the accident but thereafter I regained
           consciousness. I cannot say when the PCR has come to the
           spot. It is wrong to suggest that I have filed a false case in
           connivance with Police Officers in order to extort money or
           that the eye witness is planted or that the persons who were
           going from the spot had seen the incident or that I am
           deposing falsely....."
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">                                                     (Emphasis added)

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">5.     The appellant argues that as per the respondents' deposition no friend
of his was present at the accident spot, therefore, the affidavit filed by Mr.
Rajiv Kr. Jha would be of no consequence and of no evidentiary value. The
appellant contends that his vehicle never hit the injured, instead it was some
other vehicle which had hit him and in the process the appellant too fall on
the road and injured himself. He refers to the mechanical inspection of his
vehicle which does not record any dent or damage to it, appellant, that
mechanical condition of the offending vehicle is recorded as good. The
appellant further submits that if there had been any impact with his motor
cycle even at the permissible speed in traffic on that road, there would have
been some damage to the motor cycle i.e. its head lights would have broken
or there would be some dent or scratch to the vehicle, especially
considering the nature of injuries which were caused to the respondent,
such as: "blunt trauma abdomen and chest with hemoperitonium secondary



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">MAC.APP. 23/2017                                                  Page 3 of 13</span>
 to splenic injury (grade 4) with left sided hemopneumothorax with multiple
rib fractures left side with compound and communited fracture distal third
right tibia and fibula". Counsel argues that from the plain reading it is
evident that the injury was grievous and the impact of the offending vehicle
with the injured would have been significant. However, the mechanical
inspection of the offending vehicle does not bear out any such damage,
therefore, no case is made out against the appellant.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_9">6.     The learned counsel for the respondent referring to the same DAR
especially column 5(b) &amp; (c) which records the name of the victim i.e. Mr.
Deepak Kumar and witness Mr. Rajiv Kr. Jha, submits that this proves that
Mr. Rajiv Kr. Jha was present at the spot.       The learned counsel for the
appellant submits that column 5 is apropos the person who reported the
accident to the police whereas column 13 is about the person who witnessed
the accident. The latter being silent, it cannot be construed that Mr. Rajiv
Kr. Jha was witness to the accident and he could at best been on the side of
the road waiting for his friend to resume their joining. The learned counsel
refers to the written statement/reply to the claim petition, in particular,
paras 3, 4 &amp; 5, which read as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">           "....... 3. That the present petition against the respondent
           No. 1 is without any cause of action and is liable to be
           dismissed under Order VII Rule 11 C.P.C. It is submitted
           that the vehicle/ motor cycle bearing Registration No. DL-
           4S-AR-6498 (Hero Honda Passion) driven by the
           respondent No. 1 was not at all involved in the alleged
           accident. The answering respondent was driving his
           motor cycle in a very slow speed holding valid Driving
           License observing all traffic rules and norms and one of
           his friend namely Sh. Ayodhya Sah was sitting as pillion



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">MAC.APP. 23/2017                                                  Page 4 of 13</span>
            rider. Moreover the motor cycle of the respondent is very
           old model (2005) and can run only slow speed and
           especially when pillion rider is also sitting then it never
           be possible at any stage to run at average speed. Due to
           fitness condition of the bike, the respondent No. 1 applied
           the break at the appropriate time and the motor cycle
           also did not skid due to which neither serious accident
           could happen nor any parts of the body could scratched
           but bike fallen down on the foot of the Respondent No. 1
           and only knee got injured without any scratches on other
           parts of the body. When the unknown maruti car hit to
           upper portion of the body of the Respondent No. 1 which
           was not covered with his fallen bike and sustained
           internal injuries and bleeding from the mouth. The pillion
           rider Sh. Ayodhya Sah also fallen down on the road and
           unknown maruti car also hit the pillion rider and
           sustained greivous (sic grievous) injuries. The allegation
           of alleged rash and negligence driving of the motor cycle
           are absolutely false and frivolous. The allegation made
           against the Respondent No 1 is only a false and planted
           allegation by the police in collusion with the Petitioner
           whereas the police officials have failed to disclose the
           offending vehicle.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">                  It is submitted that the accident in question had
           occurred with some other vehicle(s) which was/were
           coming from behind. The petitioner had already crossed
           the motor cycle but vehicles coming from behind hit the
           motor bike of the respondent no.l as well as respondent
           no. 1 alongwith his friend (pillion rider) and the petitioner
           also. The respondent No. 1 also sustained Internal
           Injuries on his body alongwith his friend who sustained
           greivous Injuries. Since the respondent no. 1 was wearing
           ISI mark helmet as such his life was saved with the grace
           of Almighty God. The respondent had fallen on the road
           and was unconscious, therefore, couldn't note down the

            registration number of the offending maruti car
           responsible for the accident. The respondent No. 1
           sustained Internal Injuries on his body without any
           scratches and remained on medical leave from his office
           about one month. The pillion rider also sustained major
           internal injuries without any scratches on the body. The
           PCR van took the petitioner to DDU Hospital but he left
           the said hospital inspite of the fact that he was neither
           discharged nor referred to some other hospital. The
           petitioner of his own accord got himself admitted in Max
           Hospital with collusion of Police official to raise
           exaggerated bills. Driver of unknown vehicle/ Maruti Car
           who caused said accident fled away from the spot
           alongwith offending vehicle. Police officials did not
           investigate the matter properly and involved the
           respondent in the case of alleged rash and negligent
           driving in collusion of petitioner. The vehicle of the
           respondent No.l is not at all involved in this case. In fact it
           was "hit and run" case wherein the vehicle driven by the
           respondent no. 1 has been falsely implicated by the police
           officials of Police Station Delhi Cantt. New Delhi with the
           collusion of Petitioner. The Respondent No. 1 was waiting
           for DAR report in order to have detailed information so
           that Suit may be filed against the offender/ offending
           vehicle but it did not happen as the police officials in
           collusion with the petitioner involved the motor cycle
           present at the accident site in this case and evaded their
           obligation of tracing the offending vehicle involved in the
           accident. The police official not only evaded their
           obligation but also closed the door of the Respondent No.
           1 to know the actual offender/offending vehicle.

</blockquote><p id="p_10">7.     The Court would note that the DAR filed on 20.10.2015 does not
absolve the appellant of the accident having been caused by his vehicle; it
records that the offending vehicle belongs to the appellant. The Tribunal
has noted that the appellant has not been able to show whether the
Investigating Officer had any reason to falsely implicate him. In any case,
no such complaint was made against the I.O. A complaint was for the first
time filed against the injured respondent in February, 2016 for falsely
implicating the appellant, but no complaint was ever made against the I.O.

<p id="p_11">8.     The learned counsel for the respondent refers to Form-54 i.e.
Accidents Information Report of the Delhi Police dated 14.10.2015 which
was posted on its website. This records that the name of the injured as Mr.
Deepak Kumar as well as Mr. Ayodhya Shah; the offending vehicle is
mentioned as DL-4S-AR-6498, Motorcycle; the injury of Mr. Deepak
Kumar is shown as 'Grievious', while nothing is mentioned against injury
of Mr. Ayodhya Shah. The Tribunal has appreciated the evidence as under:

<blockquote id="blockquote_10">            ".....11. Now coming to the factual matrix of the present
           case it be seen that the factum of accident has been
           admitted by respondent. Though he has denied the
           negligence on his part. He had also deposed that he
           sustained injuries in the accident. The petitioner and PW2
           who is an eyewitness of the accident, have categorically
           deposed that the accident had taken place on account of
           rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle by
           respondent. As per final report under <a href="/doc/1412034/" id="a_1">Section 173</a> of
           Cr.PC, respondent has been charge sheeted for, offences
           under Section 279/338 IPG and as per arrest memo he has
           been arrested in the present case. Though he had made
           complaint dated 04.2.2016 to the SHO, PS Delhi Cantt.
           thereby requesting for registration of FIR against the
           injured but since he had hit the pedestrian, the negligence
           on his part cannot be ruled out. Further the said complaint
           has been lodged at the much later stage i.e. after
           examination of petitioner and might have been filed in
           order to avoid liability on seeing the huge amount on the
           treatment of petitioner. Though he had pleaded that his
           vehicle was not fit for driving at the high speed, then if he
           was not at a high speed or was at the controllable speed
           then why he could not control his motorcycle and hit the
           pedestrian crossing the road. He has not proved that he
           applied due care to avoid the accident but on account of
           sole negligence of petitioner, the accident could not be
           avoided."

 <a href="/doc/812822/" id="a_3">National Insurance Companv Limited vs. Pushpa Rana</a> 2009 ACJ 287 the
Tribunal noted that in view of investigation by the police and issuance of
chargesheet under <a href="/doc/1270101/" id="a_4">Section 279</a>/<a href="/doc/1721129/" id="a_5">338</a> IPC certified copy of the DAR, the
Tribunal held that the present appellant had caused the accident because of
rash and negligent driving.
</p>
<p id="p_13">10.    The learned counsel for the appellant states that in the alternative if it
is found that the appellant was responsible for the injury, then the element
of contributory negligence should have been examined and appropriately
factored in the compensation awarded. He relies upon the judgment of the
Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/594652/" id="a_6">Municipal Corporation of Greater Bombay vs. Shri
Laxman Iyer &amp; Ors</a>. AIR 2003 SC 4182.
</p>
<p id="p_14">11.    In the aforesaid case, the test to be applied was: what was or what
were the causes of damages i.e. the act of omission amounting to want of
ordinary care or in defiance of duty or obligation on the part of the
complaining party which, conjointly with the other party's negligence, was
the proximate cause of the accident that renders it to result in contributory
negligence.
</p>
<p id="p_15">12.    In his reply to the DAR, the appellant has accepted that after the
motorcycle was released on superdari, it was taken for repairs to the nearest
mechanic shop, where it was found that its axel and frame had been bent.
The reply also contends that this could not have happened due to falling of
the bike but as a result of hitting a heavy vehicle. The court is unable to
accept this argument as the said disrepair of the motorcycle could well have
occurred because of its forceful impact against another object or person on
the road.     There is no evidence or reference as to which other offending
vehicle his motorcycle hit against. The appellant did not file any complaint



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">MAC.APP. 23/2017                                                    Page 9 of 13</span>
 against such other offending vehicle for the injuries suffered by him and for
the damages caused to his motor vehicle. Hence, the sequitur is that it had
hit and injured the respondent/claimant and this forceful impact caused the
bend to its axle and frame. Thereafter the motorcycle fell and some injuries
were caused to the appellant.
</p>
<p id="p_16">13.    The DAR implicates the appellant's motor cycle for the injury caused
to the respondent. However, insofar as the DAR also records that the
victim was crossing the road when the offending vehicle hit him, the case
requires to be reconsidered to examine the issue of contributory negligence.
According to the DAR, the appellant's motor cycle was not being driven
dangerously or at excessive speed, in other words that it was being driven in
its lane and within the permissible speed limit. However, it is possible that,
despite the vehicle being driven in permissible limit, an accident can occur
when a jaywalker suddenly appears on the road. Such people apart from
impairing his own life also posed a threat to the safety and security of the
ongoing traffic. The fact that the victim chose to walk across a busy road
near the airport, with heavy morning traffic, he knowingly exposed himself
to dangers that such risk may entail. It exhibits his negligence towards his
own safety. The DAR also records that the vehicle was not poorly
maintained nor was it flouting any traffic rules. Therefore, if the vehicle
was in good condition, being driven in the right lane at the right speed, the
accident which was caused at a non-zebra Crossing by it hitting the victim,
it could be attributed to the sudden appearance of the jaywalker in front of
the offending vehicle. In the circumstances, a portion of the blame and
negligence would have to be shared by the respondent/victim/ claimant.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">MAC.APP. 23/2017                                                 Page 10 of 13</span>
<p id="p_17"> 14.    In the same vein, if the vehicle was being driven at the permissible
limit and maintaining fair distance with the vehicle moving ahead of it, it
could be said that there was a fair chance of the accident being avoided by
bringing the vehicle to stop or avoiding an impact by the sudden appearance
of the victim in front of the motorcycle. In the circumstances, negligence
on the part of both the parties is made out.
</p>
<p id="p_18">15.    However, if the appellant was riding in his lane at a safe distance
from the vehicle ahead of him and within the permissible speed i.e. not
more than 50 k.m. per hour, still he is not expected to have a literal tunnel
view or blinkered view of only his lane. A careful motor vehicle driver
keeps in perspective the entire width of the road, so as to not only drive in
one's own lane but also to avoid accidents on account of mistakes of other
road users. One has also to bear in mind that not all city roads are carefully
marked for pedestrian or zebra crossing. The time of the accident was
about 9.40 a.m. The visibility was clear. The appellant could have well
seen from some distance, the movement of the pedestrian crossing the road
and could have taken appropriate measures to avoid collision with him. His
failure to avoid the accident is the proximate cause leading to contributory
negligence. In a similar case, in <a href="/doc/1116870/" id="a_7">Narasimhaiah vs The General Manager
&amp; Anr</a>. 1998 ACJ 775, the High Court of Karnataka held as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_11">           ".... 7. The appellant in this case was a pedestrian who
           virtually walked into the path of the vehicle and got
           injured. There is a wrong notion which prevails that
           pedestrians have the birth-right to wander around the stroll
           on the roads according to their whims and fancies and that
           even if they make every effort to get run over, that the
           vehicle drivers are supposed to still try and save them. It
           has been pointed out in this judgment that the rules of the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">MAC.APP. 23/2017                                                 Page 11 of 13</span>
            road require pedestrians to avoid strolling on to the road
           and that the roads can be crossed only at designated
           places. A breach of these rules immediately holds the
           pedestrian liable for negligence and if it is demonstrated
           that the injury of death occurred due to the negligence of
           the pedestrian , the driver of the vehicle, the owner and the
           insurer would then be entitled to disclaim their liability.
           This is an aspect of the law that has been grossly
           overlooked and which requires to be very clearly restated
           and specifically brought to the notice of the public. The
           present accident took place on one of the busy roads in the
           city of Bangalore and the evidence indicates that people
           were indiscriminately walking about on the road virtually
           between the vehicles that were moving regardless of any
           concern for safety. Where a pedestrian demonstrates
           suicidal tendencies by behaving in this manner, he will be
           precluded from then holding others liable if he gets injured
           or killed and it is very necessary that this message goes out
           loud and clear. In the present instance where the driver of
           the vehicle and the injured appellant are both demonstrated
           to have been negligent, the first one for the manner in
           which the truck was being driven and the second one for
           having crossed the road at a point where he should not
           have done, this Court has had to evaluate the degrees of
           negligence for purposes of deciding whether the injured
           should be entitled to compensation and if so, how much.
           The degree of negligence on the part of the pedestrian
           having been of a relatively lower order, the Court has
           limited the compensation payable to the extent of GO of the
           amount computed. In cases of proven negligence however,
           the compensation awarded could be much lower or even
           nothing at all."

<p id="p_19">16.    In view of the aforesaid, the Court finds that the accident occurred on
account of near equal negligence of both the parties.             Hence the

 compensation amount is reduced by 45% as being the component of
contributory negligence on behalf of the injured/ respondent . The appeal is
disposed off in the above terms.
