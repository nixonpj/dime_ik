</pre>
<p id="p_1">	It is the case of the landlord/respondent that he has let out the petition mentioned premises i.e., shop No.1, Ground Floor of the building at D.No.224, 6th Main Road, Anna Nagar, Chennai  40 to an extent of 220 sq.ft., for rent.  The revision petitioner, is a tenant on a monthly rent of Rs.6,000/-, pursuant to a lease agreement entered into between the parties on 01.07.2004, for the period between 01.07.2004 and 03.06.2007. The tenancy is for a non residential purpose.  The landlord has further stated that a sum of Rs.3,00,000/- has been paid as caution deposit for the petition premises and the rent was fixed at Rs.6,000/- Per month. 
</p>
<p id="p_2">	2.	It is the further contention of the landlord that in respect of another Shop No.8, in the same premises, the rent was fixed at Rs.1,800/- per month.  Therefore, the total rent fixed in respect of the premises in occupation by the tenant was Rs.7,800/-.  According to the landlord, the respondent has committed default in payment of rent from the date of inception of the tenancy i.e. from 01.07.2004 onwards.  Though, the tenant was requested to vacate from the premises, he did not give any proper reply.
</p>
<p id="p_3">	3. The landlord has further contended that he is a law graduate and a retired counsel of Chennai Port Trust.  He is a practicing advocate in High Court, Madras and intends to put up an office in the petition premises for his use.  It is also his submission that without the consent, the tenant has made alterations in the building causing damage.  In the light of the above pleadings, he has filed two rent control proceedings in RCOP Nos.1422 and 1423 of 2007 under <a href="/doc/583891/" id="a_2">Sections 10</a> (2) (1), 10 (2) (b) (ii) and 10 (3) (a) (i) of Tamilnadu Buildings (Lease and Rent Control) Act, 1960, for eviction.
</p>
<p id="p_4">	4. The revision petitioner / tenant in his counter affidavit has contended that he has been paying rent of Rs.9,000/- per month for shop Nos.7 and 8 and he has also paid an advance amount of Rs.6,50,000/-.  He has further contended that a sum of Rs.1,00,000/- has been received by the landlord for water charges.  The tenant has further submitted that whatever alterations has been done for running a petty shop was only with the prior approval of the landlord, at the time when he was inducted as a tenant.  He also disputed that the premises is required by the landlord for own use.  According to him, there were several other shops let out by the landlord for rent and that therefore, the ground of own use and occupation, is not genuine and bonafide.
</p>	
<p id="p_5">	5.	Both the eviction petitions were tried together and the trial Judge has dismissed the petitions. The tenant, who has suffered eviction orders in RCOP Nos.1422 and 1423 of 2007, dated 21.08.2007 on the file of the learned XIII Judge, Small Causes Court, Chennai, has filed appeals in RCA Nos.291 and 282 of 2011.   The appellate authority, vide judgment, dated   31.01.2013 has accepted the findings, with regard to, two grounds that the tenant has committed haste and also committed wilful default in payment of rent.  But with regard to the findings of the trial Court that the landlord did not require the rental premises, for his own use and occupation, the appellate authority has set aside the same and ordered for eviction. 
</p>
<p id="p_6">	6.	Aggrieved by the same, the tenant has preferred the Civil Revision Petition Nos.1192 and 1193 of 2013 before this Court.  The rented premises in C.R.P.No.1192 of 2013, is Shop No.8 and the rented premises in C.R.P.No.1193 of 2013 is Shop No.7.  This Court, having regard to the fact that the respondent is a practicing advocate and that the premises are required for his practice, concurred with the judgment of the appellate authority and dismissed the Civil Revision Petitions on 29.04.2014.  
</p>
<p id="p_7">	7.	In view of the above, the Contempt Petitions are closed. Consequently, Sub-Applications are also closed.
