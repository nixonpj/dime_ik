                           JUDGMENT
</pre>

<p id="p_1">Surendra Mohan, J.
</p>
<p id="p_2">          The detenue is produced in Court by respondents 1

and 2. We have interacted with the detenue in Chambers. She

appeared to be in some kind of a trance, with a wooden

expression on her face.      She was answering our questions

mechanically and only in monosyllables. Even when we asked

her whether she would like to meet her children, she had no

clear answer. In spite of her diffidence, we permitted her to

interact with her minor children. She took them in her arms

and hold them close. We found an immediate transformation

in her entire attitude. Thereafter, we called in her husband.

She embraced him lovingly. We saw a dramatic transformation

in her on being united with her family.          Therefore, we left

them together to interact among themselves in the Chamber

W.P.(Crl.)305/2016.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                2</span><p id="p_3">

till evening. We found after Court hours that the family was

happy together.       The detenue informed us of her clear

decision to accompany the petitioners and to live with them.

We do not find any indication of her suffering from a mental

illness as alleged. We notice that the 3rd petitioner is himself a

doctor and a Medical Practitioner.     Even assuming that the

detenue has a medical problem, we are assured that he would

be able to provide her with proper medical treatment.

</p><p id="p_4">              2. We are therefore of the considered opinion that

it is necessary to permit the detenue to accompany the

petitioners. Though a counter affidavit has been filed by the

first respondent, producing Exts. R1(a) to R1(d) documents,

we are not satisfied that the custody of the detenue should be

given to respondents 1 and 2.
</p>
<p id="p_5">              This writ petition is accordingly disposed of

permitting the detenue to accompany the petitioners and to

live with them. We express our hope that, respondents 1 and

2 would not interfere in their smooth family life in the future.

W.P.(Crl.)305/2016.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                             3</span><p id="p_6">

If respondents 1 and 2 create any further problems,

respondents 3 to 6 shall take necessary action in accordance

with law by affording protection to the detenue and the

petitioners.
