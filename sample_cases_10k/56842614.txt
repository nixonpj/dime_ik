No.8874 of 2017 and COCP No.2011 of 2016 shall stand disposed of. In

             (1)     What is the scope of a separate suit filed to challenge the

                     ex-parte decree passed by a competent court of

                     jurisdiction?
</p>
<p id="p_5">             (2)     Whether in absence of any notification or evidence, the

                     property can be held to be evacuee property?
</p>
<p id="p_6">             Two suits were filed. One by Ram Lal seeking declaration with

a consequential relief of permanent injunction challenging civil court

judgment and decree passed in Civil Suit No.213 of 1985, decided on

20.10.1985. The second suit was filed by Man Singh, defendant in the first

suit, seeking decree of permanent injunction. Both the suits were

consolidated and disposed of by a single judgment passed by the trial court.

Two appeals filed by the appellant herein i.e. Ram Lal have also been

disposed of by a common judgment by the first appellate court.

</p><p id="p_7">             It is significant to note that all the parties are successor-in-

interest of one Ganga Ram. Ganga Ram had four sons, namely, Ram Lal,

appellant herein, Late Shri Mange Ram, Ram Singh and Man Singh. It is

the case of the plaintiff that some property was ancestral whereas some of

the property was his self acquired and            Ganga Ram, their father had

permitted defendant no.1 and 2 to raise construction and they have taken

over plot more than their share. It is claimed that property No.3ND was

purchased by the plaintiff on 25.06.1987 from the Custodian Department. It

is further pleaded case of the plaintiff that in the year 1995, plaintiff filed a

suit restraining the defendants from raising construction, in which

compromise was arrived at on 11.08.1987 to the effect that defendants

would hand over 125 Sq. yards land but the defendants have failed to

implement the aforesaid settlement. It was further claimed by the plaintiff


                   For Subsequent orders see RA-CR-232-CII-2018
                                        2 of 11

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4"> RSA No.3776 of 2008 (O&amp;M)                                        -3-</span>

that Man Singh filed a suit which was decreed ex-parte by the court on

23.10.1985 and he (plaintiff-appellant herein) was wrongly proceeded

against ex-parte and therefore the ex-parte judgment and decree is result of

fraud.
</p>
<p id="p_8">            Defendants contested the suit and pleaded that plaintiff has an

alternative remedy of filing an application under Order 9 Rule 13 CPC for

setting aside ex-parte judgment and decree. It was further pleaded that none

of the brothers is in occupation of more than his 1/4th share. The existence

of any compromise on 11.08.1987 was disputed.
</p>
<p id="p_9">            Both the courts after appreciating the evidence have dismissed

the suit filed by Ram Lal (appellant herein), and decreed the suit filed by

Man Singh for injunction. In short both the courts have found that sale of

property by the custodian department is sham as it is not proved on the file

that the property was ever a custodian property. The courts have further

found that plaintiff Ram Lal had failed to prove that there was any fraud in

obtaining the decree dated 23.10.1985.
</p>
<p id="p_10">            This court has heard learned counsel for the parties at length

and with their able assistance gone through the judgments passed by the

courts below and the record.
</p>
<p id="p_11">            Learned counsel while referring to Ex.P18,          a copy of the

summons, issued in the previous suit of 1985 has submitted that since the

report on the aforesaid summons is factually incorrect, therefore, ex-parte

decree is result of fraud. Learned counsel has submitted that on Ex.P18,

report dated 30.04.1985 by the Process Server records that when process

server visited the residence of Ram Lal, appellant herein, it was reported by

his mother that he has gone out for work but she refused to accept the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6"> RSA No.3776 of 2008 (O&amp;M)                                         -4-</span>

summons and, therefore, copy of the summon of the court was pasted

outside the residence of Ram Lal. He submitted that undisputedly, she had

died before that date and therefore the report was manipulated.

</p><p id="p_12">             This court has analyzed the argument of learned counsel. No

doubt, the report dated 30.04.1985 records this fact but still the court did not

proceed ex-parte against Ram Lal on the basis of the aforesaid report. Again

summons were sent, copy whereof is Ex.P17, for 06.06.1985. The process

server visited the residence of Ram Lal and the report was submitted that

Ram Lal is not present in house and he has goes out of residence for work

during day time. The members of the family who were present, refused to

accept summons/notice and therefore, once again a copy of the summon has

been pasted on the outer door of the house. Further the court still did not

proceed against the appellant ex-parte (who was defendant in the previous

suit). The court ordered local proclamation and after carrying out the local

proclamation, appellant was proceeded ex-parte.          It may be relevant to

mention here that the report of local proclamation has not been filed or

brought on record in the present proceedings. In these circumstances, in the

considered view of this court, appellant Ram Lal cannot be permitted to take

benefit of a small error in the first report dated 30.04.1985 particularly when

subsequently fresh summons were sent. On both occasions, the summons

were pasted on the outer door of the residence of the appellant Ram Lal and

thereafter efforts was made to serve Ram Lal through local proclamation.

</p><p id="p_13">             It is not the case of the appellant that he was not residing in that

house along with his family members. Although, learned counsel for the

appellant submitted that compliance of Order 5 of the Code of Civil

Proceduire has not been made. It may be noted that the court made sincere


                For Subsequent orders see RA-CR-232-CII-2018

attempt more than once to personally serve appellant herein in the previous

suit. In such circumstances, substantial compliance has been made and

therefore the previous judgment cannot be held to be result of fraud on the

aforesaid small error. Still further plaintiff-appellant has chosen to challenge

the decree passed in the year 1985 by filing a suit on 12.02.1994 and

therefore, the present suit is also barred by time.

</p><p id="p_14">             Learned counsel for the appellant further submitted that

property i.e. property No.3ND is a self acquired property having been

purchased by him from Custodian Department on 25.06.1985. He submitted

that the aforesaid property cannot be treated as Joint Hindu Family property

and hence the previous decree is result of fraud. It has come in evidence as

found by both the courts below that there was no notification declaring the

property as evacuee property under the <a href="/doc/880333/" id="a_1">Administration of Evacuee Property

Act</a>, 1950.
</p>
<p id="p_15">             It may be noted that Ganga Ram was elder of a Hindu Family.

It is the case of the plaintiff that some property was ancestral and the

property No.3ND, which was his self acquired property. Even if it is

assumed that the assertion of the plaintiff is correct with respect to property

No.3ND, still once in the previous suit, a decree was passed dividing the

property which included the property in dispute which is claimed to be self

acquired property, the decree cannot be set aside on the ground that it is

result of fraud.
</p>
<p id="p_16">             Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that civil court has

no jurisdiction to examine whether property is property of the Custodian or

not. He made reference to <a href="/doc/375519/" id="a_2">Section 46</a> of the Administration of Evacuee

Property Act, 1950. No doubt, the jurisdiction of the civil court is barred.


</p><p id="p_17">                   For Subsequent orders see RA-CR-232-CII-2018

However, it was incumbent on the plaintiff to first prove that the property

was ever notified as custodian property.
</p>
<p id="p_18">             Now the stage is set for considering the issues which have been

framed.
</p>
<p id="p_19">             With regard to first issue, it may be noted that a party aggrieved

by an ex-parte decree has four options:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">             (1)     The party is entitled to file an application under Order 9

                     Rule 13 CPC for setting aside ex-parte decree. In those

                     proceedings, party is entitled to establish before the court

                     that he has been incorrectly proceeded against ex-parte or

                     there was a sufficient cause for his non-appearance and

                     therefore he has right to be heard in the suit.

             (2)     The party also has a right to challenge the decree on

                     merits by filing an appeal.        The appellate court can

                     examine the case on merits and decide.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">             (3)     A party against whom ex-parte decree was passed can

                     also file a separate suit on the ground that the previous

                     decree was result of fraud. However, in subsequent suit,

                     the court can interfere only if fraud is proved.

             (4)     In appropriate cases he can also file an application for

                     review in which again the court has a very limited

                     jurisdiction.</blockquote><p id="p_20">

</p><p id="p_21">             As noted above, in the proceeding under Order 9 Rule 13 i.e.

application for setting aside ex-parte decree, party is entitled to establish

before the court that he was proceed against ex-parte wrongly. As regards a

separate suit, for declaration that the ex-parte decree is result of fraud, it can


                   For Subsequent orders see RA-CR-232-CII-2018
                                        6 of 11

only be set aside unless the court comes to the conclusion that such decree

is result of fraud. Fraud has to be pleaded and proved like a criminal case.

A small irregularity in the report of the process server would not make the

judgment and decree fraudulent particularly when party to the suit was not

proceed against ex-parte on the aforesaid report. Similarly, the scope of

review application, if any, filed is very limited.

</p><p id="p_22">             Learned counsel for the appellate while referring to a judgment

passed by the Hon'ble Supreme court in the case of <a href="/doc/1147404/" id="a_3">Mahesh Yadav and

another vs. Rajeshwar Singh and others</a>, (2009) 2 SCC 205 has submitted

that the courts have wrongly held that the separate suit is not maintainable.

Learned counsel has referred to para 15 of the judgment, wherein the

Hon'ble Supreme Court concluded that these 4 options as noted above are

available. Paragraph 15 is extracted as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">                    "15. The proviso appended to Oder IX rule 13 of the

                    Code of Civil Procedure postulates that when an ex

                    parte decree has been passed against some of the

                    defendants and it is necessary to set aside the entire

                    decree, the Court is not powerless to do so.        If an

                    application for setting aside the ex parte decree was

                    maintainable at the instance of the appellants, we fail to

                    understand as to why a separate suit was required to be

                    filed. When an ex parte decree is passed, the defendant

                    may have more than one remedies. He may file a suit

                    contending that the decree was obtained fraudulently.

                    He may file an application under Order IX Rule 13 of the

                    Code of Civil Procedure for setting aside the ex parte

</p><p id="p_24">            On careful reading of the aforesaid judgment, it is apparent that

reliance has been placed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court on a previous

judgment in the case of <a href="/doc/785132/" id="a_4">Bhanu Kumar Jain v. Archana Kumar and

another</a>, (2005) 1 SCC, 787.        The conclusion drawn by the Hon'ble

Supreme court in the aforesaid judgment is in para 38, which is extracted as

under:-

<blockquote id="blockquote_4">                  38. The dichotomy, in our opinion, can be resolved by

                  holding that whereas the defendant would not be

                  permitted to raise a contention as regards the

                  correctness or otherwise of the order posting the suit for

                  ex parte hearing by the trial court and/or existence of a

                  sufficient case for non-appearance of the defendant

                  before it, it would be open to him to argue in the first

                  appeal filed by him under Section 96(2) of the Code on

                  the merits of the suit so as to enable him to contend that

                  the materials brought on record by the plaintiffs were

                  not sufficient for passing a decree in his favour or the

                  suit was otherwise not maintainable.                Lack of

                  jurisdiction of the court can also be a possible plea in

                  such an appeal. We, however, agree with Mr. Chaudhari

                  that the "Explanation" appended to Order 9 Rule 13 of

                  the Code shall receive a strict construction as was held

                  by this Court in Rani Choudhary, P. Kiran Kumar and

</p><p id="p_26">            On careful examination of the aforesaid judgments and the

relevant portions which have been extracted above, it can be concluded that

no doubt separate suit is maintainable to challenge an ex-parte decree but

the same can only be allowed if the court comes to a conclusion that

previous ex-parte decree was result of fraud.
</p>
<p id="p_27">            In the present case, no fraud has been established. Even if it is

assumed for argument sake that some property i.e. property no.3ND was self

acquired property, but once parties have chosen to divide the same amongst

family members by including the entire property, the decree cannot be said

to be result of fraud. It was equitable distribution of the property held by

the family members.
</p>
<p id="p_28">            Now let us examine the second issue which noted above. In the

considered view of this court, on careful examination of the various

judgment relied upon by learned counsel for the parties, it is apparent that

the notification under <a href="/doc/1150879/" id="a_6">Section 7</a> of the Administration of Evacuee Property

Act, 1950, is sine-qua non for holding that the property is evacuee property .

No doubt, <a href="/doc/115347/" id="a_7">Section 8</a> of the Administration of Evacuee Property Act, 1950

also includes those properties which have been declared as such prior to the

enactment of the Act. Still further, there was an amendment in the Act of

1950 by Act no.42 of 1954 enforced with effect from 08.10.1954 which

provided that no property shall be declared evacuee property on or after

07.05.1954, However, there was certain exceptions which were carved out

under <a href="/doc/1010812/" id="a_8">Section 7A</a>. In the present case, apart from allotment and the sale

deed, executed by the Custodian Department, no substantive evidence has

been led to prove that property no.3ND was a custodian property. It is the

claim of the appellant that he was paying rent to the Custodian Department

from the year 1947 till April 1987. However, when Ram Lal appeared in

evidence, he gave his age as 72 years on 08.04.2006. Meaning thereby the

plaintiff claims that he was barely 13 years old when he started paying rent

to the Custodian Department. Hence, the tenancy in favour of the plaintiff-

Ram Lal becomes highly doubtful. Learned counsel has further made a

reference to an order passed by the Joint Secretary Rehabilitation-cum-

Settlement Commissioner, dated 18.10.1985. By this order, an application

filed by Mange Ram, for impleading him as a party in the proceedings <a href="/doc/1937475/" id="a_9">Ram

Lal vs. State</a> was dismissed by the Settlement Officer while holding that he

cannot adjudicate upon this controversy as such controversy only be

adjudicated upon in the capacity as a custodian general. In the considered

view of this court, this order nowhere concludes that the property belongs

to Custodian Department.
</p>
<p id="p_29">            Now let's deal with Civil Revision No.8874 of 2017.

            This revision petition has been filed against an order passed by

the court under <a href="/doc/144109/" id="a_10">Section 10</a> of the Code of Civil procedure staying the

proceedings in the subsequent suit. Once the appeal is being decided, the

civil court would proceed with the suit as the reason for staying the

proceedings has ceased to exist.
</p>
<p id="p_30">            As regards COCP No.2011 of 2016, it may be noted that

violation of the interim order passed by this court has been asserted.

However, learned counsel for the petitioner in COCP has submitted that the

judgment passed in the main case would also govern the decision of this

COCP.
