JUDGMENT:
</pre>

<p id="p_1">   1. This petition u/s. 166 &amp; 140 of the <a href="/doc/785258/" id="a_1">M.V. Act</a>, 1988 as amended upto 
      date (hereinafter referred to as Act) has been filed by Sh. Mani Raj Rai 
      claiming a compensation of Rs. 10,00,000/­ for the injuries sustained 
      by him in an accident happened on 27.10.2007 at about 1.30 PM near 
      the  crossing of Priya Cinema, Vasant Vihar, Delhi.
</p>
<p id="p_2">   2. It is stated   that on the aforesaid date and time, the petitioner was 
      going to his house at 6, Purvi Apartment, Vasant Vihar, New Delhi by 
      bus bearing No. DL­10B­5595.  When he reached near Priya Cinema, 
      he   asked   the   bus   driver   i.e   Respondent   No.   1   to   stop   the   bus, 
      accordingly the respondent No. 1 stopped the bus, but when he was 
      getting   down   from   the   bus,   all   of   a   sudden   the   bus   driver   i.e. 
      respondent No. 1 drove the bus in a very rash and negligent manner 
      as a result of which he fell down and sustained injuries on his right 
      leg.  He was removed to the Safdarjung Hospital, where doctor found 
      multiple fractures  in his right leg and other injuries  on his body. He 
      was   operated   at   Safdarjung   Hospital.   Being   not   satisfied   with   the 
      treatment, he was admitted in Batra Hospital for further treatment.  
</p>
<p id="p_3">   3. It is stated that at the time of accident, the petitioner was running a 
      Fast Food Shop at E­Block, Vasant Vihar, New  Delhi and earning Rs. 
      8,000/­ per month.   He was active and hardworking but due to the 
      said   accident   he   is   unable   to   run   his   shop.   It   is   stated   that   the 
      offending   vehicle   is   owned   by   Respondent   No­2   and   insured   with 
      Respondent­3.     Thus   all   the   respondents   are   jointly   and   severely 
      liable to pay compensation.
</p>
<p id="p_4">   4. Contrary to the petition filed the Respondent No. 3 filed its Written 
      Statement alleging that the driver of the offending vehicle was not 
      having effective and valid driving license and thus committed breach 


Suit No. 470/2010                                                               Page No. 2/9

      of the conditions of the Insurance Policy.   However, it was admitted 
      that   vehicle   was   insured   with   Insurance   Company   vide   Policy   No. 
      OG­07­1104­1812­00000118   for   the   period   from   01.03.2007   to 
      29.02.2008 .  Respondent No. 1 and Respondent No. 2 also contested 
      the   petition   and   interalia   stated   that   the   petitioner   had   tried   to 
      deboard the bus in running condition and he himself fell down from 
      the bus, however,   they were proceeded ex­parte vide order   dated 
      21.12.2010.
</p>
<p id="p_5">   5. From the petition and the Written Statement on 24.07.2010 following 
      issues were framed :
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">               1. Whether the deceased died of injuries received 
               in road accident on 27.10.2007 at 01.30 PM near

      reiterated the facts as stated in the petition stating that he has spent 
      more   than   Rs.   2,00,000/­   on   his   treatment   and   he   is   still     under 
      observation.  He stated that he has spent Rs. 25,000/­ on conveyance 
      for visiting the hospitals, Rs. 50,000/­ on special diet and Rs. 30,000/­ 
      on attendant charges.   He stated that he  was running a Fast Food 
      Shop at Vasant Vihar and earning Rs. 8,000/­ per month but due to 
      the   accident,     he   lost   his   income.   He   placed     the   bills   and   the 
      documents vide Ex.PW1/1 to Ex.PW1/68 and the certified copy of the

      sustained injuries due to his own mistake or that the medical bills 
      filed   by   him   are   false   and   fabricated   or   that   he   did   not   incur   Rs.

<p id="p_7">Suit No. 470/2010                                                                Page No. 3/9

      50,000/­   on   special   diet   and   Rs.   30,000/­   on   attendant   charges. 
      However, he admitted that he did not place any proof of his earnings. 
</p>
<p id="p_8">   7. Insurance Company / Respondent No. 3 despite opportunity given, 
      did not lead any evidence and on the statement of the counsel for the 
      Insurance   Company,   respondent's   evidence   was   closed   vide   order 
      dated 07.04.2011. 
</p>
<p id="p_9">   8. I   have   heard   the   arguments   advanced   by   Ld.   counsel   Sh.   Ganesh 
      Tripathi   for   the   petitioner   and   Sh.   Ali   Murtza,   Ld.   counsel   for 
      Insurance Company and gone through the record. 
</p>
<p id="p_10">      I S S U E   N O. 1 

</p><p id="p_11">   9.     It is well settled law that where petition under <a href="/doc/136948773/" id="a_2">Section 166</a> of the Act 
      is instituted, it becomes the duty of the petitioner to establish rash 
      and   negligent   driving.     To   prove   rash   and   negligent   driving   in   a 
      petition   under   <a href="/doc/785258/" id="a_3">Motor  Vehicles   Act</a>,  Tribunal   need   not   go   into   the 
      technicality because strict rules of procedure and evidence are not 
      followed.     Basically,   in   road   accident   cases,  Tribunal   is   simply   to 
      quantify the compensation which is just rational and reasonable on 
      the basis of enquiry.   The proceedings under <a href="/doc/785258/" id="a_4">Motor Vehicles Act</a> are 
      not akin to the proceedings in a civil suit. Further, roving enquiry is 
      not required to prove the rashness and negligence on the part of the 
      driver as has been held in  Kaushumma Begum and others Vs. New  
      India Assurance Co. Ltd. 2001  ACJ 421 SC

</p><p id="p_12">   10. In the present case it has come in the testimony of PW1 that at the 
      time of accident, R­1 was driving the offending vehicle in a rash and 
      negligent manner.  When he was getting down from the bus, the bus 
      driver   i.e   Respondent   No.   1   all   of   a   sudden   drove   the   bus,   due   to 
      which he fell down and sustained injuries.  The case was registered at 
      PS  Vasant  Vihar.     Charge­sheet   after   investigation   was   filed   which 
      revealed that the accident took place due to rash and negligent act of 


Suit No. 470/2010                                                               Page No. 4/9

       Respondent No. 1. 
</p>
<p id="p_13">   11.   For the aforesaid facts and circumstances, I am of the considered 
       opinion that Respondent No.­1 was driving the offending vehicle in 
       rash and negligent manner on the day of fateful accident  which was 
       owned by Respondent No. 2 and insured with Respondent No. 3. 
</p>
<p id="p_14">   12. Accordingly,  Issue  No.  1  is  decided   in favour   of  the   petitioner   and 
       against the respondents. 
</p>
<p id="p_15">       I S S U E  N O . 2 

</p><p id="p_16">   13. The   petitioner   has   claimed   Rs.   10,00,000/­   as   compensation   in 
       respect of the injuries sustained by him.  In a road accident a person 
       is  entitled  to   compensation   for  the   pecuniary    and  non­pecuniary 
       damages.   Let me assess the compensation which the petitioner is 
       entitled for under different heads.
</p>
<p id="p_17">       COMPENSATION   FOR   EXPENSES   INCURRED   ON 
       MEDICAL TREATMENT

</p><p id="p_18">   14.   The   petitioner   has   claimed   to   have   spent   Rs.   2,00,000/­   on   his 
       medical   treatment   but   he   has  placed   the   bills   of   Rs.   34,805/­   vide 
       Ex.PW1/13   to   Ex.PW1/67.     However,   looking   into   the   nature   of 
       injuries and the treatment met by the petitioner, I award a sum of Rs. 
       40,000/­ towards the  medical expenses. 
</p>
<p id="p_19">       COMPENSATION   FOR   PAIN   AND   SUFFERINGS   AND 
       ENJOYMENT OF LIFE :
</p>
<p id="p_20">   15.  From the testimony of PW1 and the documents placed on record, I 
       find that the petitioner after the accident was immediately removed 
       to Safdarjung Hospital where he was operated on his leg which had 
       multiple   fractures.     From   Safdarjung   Hospital,   he   went   to   Batra 
       Hospital where he got further treatment.   He has stated that he had 
       been running a Fast Food Shop and earning Rs. 8,000/­ per month. 
</p>
<p id="p_21">Suit No. 470/2010                                                             Page No. 5/9
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                                 6</span>

      The medical summary placed with the file also shows that it was a 
      case of crush injury.  He remained under the treatment at Safdarjung 
      Hospital from 27.10.2007 to 28.11.2007.    He was admitted in Batra 
      Hospital   on   06.02.2009   and   discharged   on   08.02.2009.     As   per   the 
      discharge summary Ex.PW1/12, the petitioner had history of crush 
      injury in 2007 in right foot for which he was managed in Safdarjung 
      Hospital.  He has difficulty in walking and has deformity in his right 
      foot.   From the medical record, I find that he could not perform his 
      ordinary pursuits for quite a long time i.e. atleast for a period of 16 
      months.   Thus, the compensation towards pain and sufferings and 
      enjoyment of life on this account is taken as Rs. 50,000/­.  I therefore, 
      award Rs. 50,000/­ towards pain and sufferings and enjoyment of life. 
</p>
<p id="p_22">      COMPENSATION   FOR   SPEICAL   DIET,   ATTENDANT 
      CHARGES AND CONVEYANCE CHARGES  :
</p>
<p id="p_23">   16.  It has come in the testimony of petitioner that because of the fracture 
      and injuries he could not do the routine functions nor walk freely. It is 
      seen that a person who gets injured in a road accident is advised  to 
      take protein in his diet to recover   from the injuries. Petitioner has 
      stated   that   he   has   taken   the   help   of   attendant   for   his   day   to   day 
      needs.   Taking these facts into consideration, I award a sum of Rs. 
      50,000/­   towards   special   diet,   attendant   charges   and   conveyance

      and had difficulty in walking.  He also had deformity in his right foot. 
      Due to the said injuries his earning capacity has affected.  I find that 
      the petitioner could not  carry out his work for a period of at least 9 
      months.   I therefore, award a sum of  Rs. 9 x Rs. 3940 = Rs. 35,460/­
