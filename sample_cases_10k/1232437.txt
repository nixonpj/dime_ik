                 =====================

<p id="p_1">      Petitioner commenced his service as a Junior Accountant.

He was promoted as Treasurer w.e.f. 5/2/1979. On completion of

10 years, he was extended the higher grade in the scale of pay of

Rs.1050-1830 w.e.f. 5/2/1989.        That scale was the scale

applicable to Selection Grade Accountant, to which post,

petitioner was later promoted w.e.f. 8/8/1994, as a result of

which, the promotion did not involve any change in the scale of

pay.
</p>
<p id="p_2">      2.    Meanwhile 1992 pay revision was implemented and

the petitioner opted for the benefit of the pay revision w.e.f.

16.8.95. He was thereafter promoted as Junior Superintendent on

8/7/97. The 1997 pay revision was implemented w.e.f. 1/3/1997

and, on his promotion, the petitioner opted for the benefit of 1997

Pay Revision w.e.f. 01/02/98. On his promotion as Sub Treasurer

Officer w.e.f. 4/1/2002, when the pay was to be authenticated by

the 2nd respondent, Ext.P1 audit objection was raised by the

Accountant General that the options exercised by the petitioner

WPC 18765/06
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                 :2 :</span>



for the benefit of 1992 pay revision and 1997 pay revision were

irregular and that has to be rectified.
</p>
<p id="p_3">      3.   Petitioner represented against the audit objection by

filing Ext.P2 enclosing Ext.P3 Government Order. Subsequently,

he was promoted as District Treasury Officer w.e.f. 9/6/2006 and

again as Deputy Director of Treasuries. While continuing in that

post, the petitioner attained the age of superannuation and

retired on 30/4/2008.
</p>
<p id="p_4">      4.   In this writ petition, he is aggrieved by Ext.P10, the

final order passed pursuant to Ext.P1 audit objection and he also

complains that despite having given promotions, the pay has not

been refixed in the higher posts and that terminal benefits have

not been released so far.
</p>
<p id="p_5">      5.   The first question that arises is regarding the validity of

Ext.P1 audit objection, which culminated in Ext.P10 order. A

reading of Ext.P1 shows that the Accountant General was of the

view that the option exercised by the petitioner for the 1992 pay

revision w.e.f. 16/8/95 was inadmissible , as according to the pay

revision order, his pay could be fixed in the revised scale w.e.f.

8/8/94 only. In so far as the 1997 pay revision is concerned, it is

WPC 18765/06
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                 :3 :</span>



stated that the petitioner could have either opted the scale of pay

of the lower post as on 1/3/97 or the promoted post w.e.f. 8/7/97

and not w.e.f. 1.2.98. It is this objection which has been upheld

by all authorities including the Government by Ext.P10 order.

</p><p id="p_6">      6.   Counsel for the petitioner attempted to sustain the

options exercised by him and canvassed that the audit objection

raised is erroneous. Learned counsel relied on Exts.P3 and P7.

Ext.P3 is a Government Order dated 28/6/1997. A reading of this

order shows that by this order, Government allowed employees

who got time bound higher grade on or after 1/3/92 to opt for

time bound higher grade on a date of their choice and to continue

in the pre-revised scale till the date of such option. Thus, the

option contemplated in Ext.P3 order is one exercised as a result of

the extension of time bound higher grade.
</p>
<p id="p_7">      7.   On the other hand, the petitioner opted for 16/8/95

following his "promotion" as Selection Grade Accountant w.e.f.

8/8/94 for coming into the 1992 pay revision. Therefore, the

option exercised by the petitioner is not as a consequence of the

extension of time bound higher grade and therefore his case is

not protected by Ext.P3 Government Order. In so far as Ext.P7 is

WPC 18765/06
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                :4 :</span>



concerned, that also shows that the case covered by the said

order is not the same as that of the petitioner.

</p><p id="p_8">      8.   Further, Clause 7 of the Appendix to Annexure III of the

1997 Pay Revision Order shows that the employees who were

promoted on or after 1/3/1997 cannot be allowed to exercise

option for the scale of the feeder post beyond the date of such

promotion. If that be the position, the option exercised by the

petitioner following his promotion as Junior Superintendent w.e.f.

8/7/97, was to a date beyond the date of his promotion and

therefore such option is against Clause 7 of Annexure III to the

1997 Pay Revision.
</p>
<p id="p_9">      9.   However, it is now pointed out that realising the

mistake in the option exercised by the petitioner, by Ext.P6,

though belatedly, the petitioner has opted for the benefit of 1997

Pay Revision w.e.f.1/3/97.
</p>
<p id="p_10">      10. Therefore, in such circumstances, audit objection

raised by the Accountant General deserves to be upheld and

Ext.P10 Government Order needs to be affirmed and I do so.

</p><p id="p_11">      11. The other complaint of the petitioner is that refixation

of pay consequent on the promotions from the post of Sub

WPC 18765/06
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                 :5 :</span>



Treasury Officer onwards has not been given. This contention of

the petitioner is answered in para 15 of the counter affidavit filed,

where it is stated that pay at the minimum of scale of the

promoted posts have been authorised.
</p>
<p id="p_12">       12. In view of the complaint now raised that his pay has

not been refixed from the post of Sub Treasury Officer,

necessarily, respondents 1 and 2 will have to refix the pay of the

petitioner, quantify the benefits that are due to him and release

his terminal benefits as well. This the respondents shall do, as

expeditiously as possible, at any rate within 3 months of

production of a copy of this judgment.
</p>
<p id="p_13">      13. Needless to say that once the process is completed,

the pension that is due shall be paid within one month and arrears

will also be released to the petitioner in accordance with law.

</p><p id="p_14">      Writ petition is disposed of as above.
