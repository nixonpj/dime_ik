O R D E R
</pre>
<p id="p_1">              This appeal has been preferred by Smt. Dropti Devi

who   was   the   tenant   in   respect   of   one   ground   floor   shop   in

property No.WZ­30C, Gali No.9, Varinder Nagar, New Delhi on

a monthly rent of Rs.785/­ since 1989.   In brief the case of the

Appellant is that she is an 80 year old illiterate widow and was

making the payment of rent regularly for which consolidated rent

receipts were issued by the respondent as per his convenience.
</p>
<p id="p_2">The respondent filed an eviction petition on the ground of non­




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                       1</span>
 payment of the rent for the period 01.12.04 till 31.03.05 and in

the written statement she pleaded that being an old women, she

surrendered her tenancy and her son was inducted as tenant in

the presence of various persons of the locality and that her son

was making full payment of the rent for which no rent receipt

was issued.  
</p>
<p id="p_3">2.            In   the   said   eviction   petition   vide   order   dated

24.01.07, Ld.ARC passed an order u/s 15(1) DRC Act directing

to deposit legally recoverable arrears of rent w.e.f 01.12.04 till

date and also to deposit future rent at the same rate month by

month by 15th day of each succeeding month.  The Appellant had

deposited the entire arrears of rent and was entitled to get benefit

of Sec.14(2) DRC Act and moved an application for granting of

such   benefit,   however,   vide   impugned   order   dated   16.07.09,

Ld.ARC declined to grant such benefit for the reason that there

was delay in depositing of month to month rent which could not

be   attributed   to   the   Appellant   for   the   reason   that   rent   was

deposited as and when advised by her counsel and there was no

deliberate non­payment of the rent which stood paid upto July,

2009.   The impugned order has been challenged on the ground



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                      2</span>
 that delay was not willful or deliberate or attributed by Appellant

and Ld.ARC also failed to appreciate that there was substantial

compliance of the order. Ld.ARC had the discretion to condone

delay in appropriate cases where the tenant was not a chronic

defaulter but victim of circumstances.  Ld. Trial Court failed to

see the reasons for delay and just passed the orders on the basis

of report of Nazir that there was delay in the deposit of future

rent and in the circumstances, impugned order dated 16.07.09 be

set aside as it was a first case of default and Appellant is entitled

to protection of Section 14(2) of DRC Act.  
</p>
<p id="p_4">3.            Notice   of   the   appeal   was   sent   to   the   respondent.
</p>
<p id="p_5">TCR was also summoned.
</p>
<p id="p_6">4.            I have heard ld. counsels for the parties and carefully

gone   through   the   record.    Ld.   counsel   for   the   appellant   has

contended that initially default was for the period of four months

and the order passed by Ld. ARC u/s 15(1) DRC Act was duly

complied   with   by   the   Appellant   and   the   delay   that   occurred

subsequently by the Appellant in deposit of rent month to month

could be condoned by Ld.ARC as on the date of passing of the

impugned order, the entire rent stood paid, hence, the impugned



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                      3</span>
 order is liable to be set aside.  Ld. counsel for the appellant had

relied   upon   judgments   Shyamcharan   Sharma   Vs     Dharamdas

AIR 1980 SC 587 and Ram Murti Vs  Bhola Nath &amp; Anr. AIR

1984   SC   1392   in   support   of   his   contentions.     So   far   as   the

judgment     Shyamcharan   Sharma   Vs     Dharamdas   (Supra)   is

concerned,   the   case   was   under   M.P.   Accommodation   Control

Act (41 of 1961).   The same is of no help to the Appellant as

under M.P. Accommodation Control Act  a discretion is given to

the Court to extend the time for deposit of the rent whereas no

such discretion is available to the Ld. ARC under DRC Act.  In

the case Jain Motor Car Co.     Vs     Shyam Prabha Jain &amp; Ors.
</p>
<p id="p_7">1983(1)   Rent   Control   Reporter   276,   while   dealing   with   this

judgment, in Para 8 of the said judgment while considering the

provisions of Section 12(3), Section 12(1)(a) and Section 13 of

M.P. Accommodation Control Act (41 of 1961), it was held as

under­

                 "In that Act, discretion is given to the Court
                 to extend the time for deposit of rent on the
                 application  of  the  tenant.    <a href="/doc/679372/" id="a_1">Under  the  Delhi
                 Rent   Control   Act</a>,   1958   no   such   discretion
                 has   been   conferred   upon   the   Controller   as
                 has been held by the Full Bench of this Court
                 which view was confirmed by the Supreme
                 Court.     Thus   it   appears   to   me   that   the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                       4</span>
                 Supreme   Court   judgment   in   Shyamcharan
                (Supra) is not applicable to the facts of the
                present case."
</p>
<p id="p_8">              Another judgment   Ram Murti Vs   Bhola Nath  &amp;

Anr. relied upon by the Ld. counsel for the appellant is also of no

help to the Appellant as it is clear from the impugned order that

there was a regular default by him in depositing the future month

to month rent.
</p>
<p id="p_9">5.            On behalf of respondent it has been contended that

Appellant   had   failed   to   comply   with   by   the   order   passed   by

Ld.ARC   u/s   15(1)   DRC   Act   though,   arrears   of   rent   was

deposited   but   for   depositing   the   future   rent,   it   was   to   be

deposited   on   15th  of   every   succeeding   month   which   was   not

deposited   in   time   and   there   was   regular   default   in   complying

with that order.  It has been further contended that Ld.ARC had

no power to extend that time, hence appeal may be dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_10">6.            I have considered the rival contentions and carefully

gone through the record.
</p>
<p id="p_11">7.            As per the impugned order dated 16.07.09 although

the   Appellant   deposited   the   arrears   of   rent   within   the   time

extended   by   Ld.   ARCT   vide   order   dated   27.02.07,   the



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                      5</span>
 subsequent rents were deposited with considerable delay.  
</p>
<p id="p_12">8.            Ld.   ARC   has   mentioned   the   various   delays   in

depositing the rent in the order i.e. delay of 12 months in the

deposit of rent for the month of April, 2007, delay of 11 months

in the deposit of rent for the month of May, 2007, delay of 10

months in the deposit of rent for the month of June, 2007, delay

of 9 months in the deposit of rent for the month of July, 2007,

delay of 8 months in the deposit of rent for the month of August,

2007, delay of 7 months in the deposit of rent for the month of

September, 2007, delay of 6 months in the deposit of rent for the

month of October, 2007, delay of 5 months in the deposit of rent

for   the   month   of   November,   2007,   delay   of   4   months   in   the

deposit  of   rent  for   the   month   of   December,   2007,   delay   of  3

months in the deposit of rent for the month of January, 2008,

delay   of   2   months   in   the   deposit   of   rent   for   the   month   of

February, 2008, delay of 1 month in the deposit of rent for the

month of March, 2008 and there is also delay of 75 days in the

deposit of rent for the month of June, 2008, delay of 47 days in

the deposit of rent for the month of July, 2008, delay of 15 days

in the deposit of rent for the month of August, 2008, delay of 77



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                       6</span>
 days in the deposit of rent for the month of October, 2008, delay

of 47 days in the deposit of rent for the month of November,

2008 and there is delay of 17 days in the deposit of rent for the

month of December, 2008.   This report by the Civil Nazir as

quoted     in   the   impugned   order   clearly   establishes   that   the

Appellant had not been complying with the order passed u/s 15

(1) DRC Act by depositing month to month rent by 15th of every

month.   In the case of Jain Motor Car Co.   Vs   Shyam Prabha

Jain &amp; Ors. 1983 (1) RCR 276, the Hon'ble High Court of Delhi

dealt with this aspect as under­

       "5.   To claim eviction on the ground of non­payment
       of   rent   a   landlord   is   required   to   serve   a   notice   of
       demand   upon   the   tenant   and   if   he   neither   pays   nor
       tenders   the   whole   of   the   arrears   of   rent   legally
       recoverable from him within two months of the date of
       service   of   the   notice   of   demand,   cause   of   action
       accrues to the landlord to claim eviction of the tenant
       u/s 14(1)(a) of the Act.   This is not the end.   Even if
       the tenant has neither paid nor tendered the whole of
       the   arrears   of   rent   legally   recoverable   within   two
       months   from   the   date   of   service   of   the   notice   of
       demand, he is granted further opportunity to pay the
       rent in pursuance of the order u/s 15 (1) of the Act.
       This Section requires the Controller to pass an order
       directing the tenant to pay the rent at the rate at which
       it was last paid within one month from the date of the
       order.   This section further requires the Controller to
       pass an order for deposit of further monthly rent by the
       15th  of each succeeding month.   <a href="/doc/559308/" id="a_2">Section 15(1)</a> of the
       Act  is  thus  into   two   parts.     Under   the   first  part  the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                       7</span>
 tenant is to required to deposit further monthly rent.
Under 15(7) of the Act if the tenant fails to deposit
either the arrears of rent or future monthly rent, the
Controller has discretion to strike off the defence of
the tenant.   Further under <a href="/doc/234547/" id="a_3">Section 15(3)</a> of the Act if
there is any dispute as to the amount of rent payable by
the tenant, it provides for fixation of interim rent and
requiring the tenant to deposit arrears as well as further
monthly rent at the rate of interim rent.   This section
further   provides   that   after   the   determination   of
standard rent, the tenant shall be required to pay the
arrears on the basis of the determined rent within one
month of the date of the order or such further time as
the Controller may grant in this behalf.   Thus under
<a href="/doc/234547/" id="a_4">section  15(3)</a>  of  the  Act  first an  order is  passed  for
deposit of arrears and future rent at the interim rate of
rent and second order is passed requiring the tenant to
deposit the difference between  the standard rent and
the   interim   rate   of   rent.     <a href="/doc/367290/" id="a_5">Section   14(2)</a>   of   the   Act
provides that no order for eviction of the tenant on the
ground mentioned under <a href="/doc/367290/" id="a_6">section 14(1)(a)</a> of Act shall
be passed if the tenant makes payment or deposit in
pursuance of the order passed under <a href="/doc/1987465/" id="a_7">Section 15</a> of the
Act.  In other words, it would mean that if a tenant has
neither paid nor tendered the whole of the arrears of
rent legally recoverable from him within the period of
two   months   from   the   date   of   service   of   notice   of
demand   he   is   to   be   protected   against   eviction   if   he
deposits all arrears of rent and future monthly rent in
pursuance of an order passed under <a href="/doc/559308/" id="a_8">Section 15(1)</a> of
the Act.  <a href="/doc/367290/" id="a_9">Section 14(2)</a> of the Act does not speak of the
payment or deposit of arrears of rent only within the
meaning   of   <a href="/doc/1150627/" id="a_10">section   12</a>   of   the   Act   but   it   speaks   of
payment or deposit as required by <a href="/doc/1987465/" id="a_11">Section 15</a> of the
Act.   As already stated, it would mean the deposit of
arrears as well as future monthly rent in pursuance of
the order under <a href="/doc/1987465/" id="a_12">Section 15</a> (1) of the Act.  It appears to
me that unless the arrears of rent and future monthly
rent are deposited, the tenant would not be entitled to
any   protection   under   <a href="/doc/367290/" id="a_13">section   14(2)</a>  of   the  Act.    The


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                               8</span>
 provisions of <a href="/doc/1987465/" id="a_14">section 15</a> (1) of the Act are mandatory.
In   Delhi   Cloth   &amp;   General   Mills   Co.   Ltd.   Vs   Hem
Chand &amp; Anr., AIR 1972 Delhi 275 (F.B.) it has been
held  that the  Rent  Controller has no inherent power
and no jurisdiction to condone the delay in deposit of
the   amount   of   rent   directed   to   be   paid   or   deposited
under <a href="/doc/559308/" id="a_15">section 15(1)</a> of the Act so as to wipe off the
default that has occurred.  In other words, it was held
that   the   Controller   has   no   discretion   to   extend   time
either for deposit of arrears of rent or future monthly
rent in pursuance of the order passed under <a href="/doc/1987465/" id="a_16">section 15</a>
(1) of the Act.  On appeal it was held by the Supreme
Court in Hem Chand Vs The Delhi Cloth &amp; General
Mills Co. Ltd. &amp; Anr. AIR 1977 S.C. 1986 that the
Rent Controller has no discretion to extend the time
prescribed under <a href="/doc/559308/" id="a_17">Section 15(1)</a> of the Act.   Thus the
Supreme   Court   agreed   with   the   Full   Bench   of   this
Court   to   that   extent.     In   other   words,   it   means   that
provisions of <a href="/doc/1987465/" id="a_18">Section 15</a> read with <a href="/doc/367290/" id="a_19">Section 14(2)</a> of the
Act are mandatory and if a tenant either fails to deposit
or pay arrears of rent within one month of the date of
the order under <a href="/doc/1987465/" id="a_20">section 15</a> (1) of the Act or fails to
deposit or pay any future monthly rent by the 15th  of
succeeding month, the Controller has no jurisdiction to
extend the time and the tenant is not entitled to claim
benefit under <a href="/doc/367290/" id="a_21">Section 14(2)</a> of the Act.  In the said Full
Bench   case   the   tenant   had   committed   default   with
respect to arrears of rent as well as future monthly rent
as is apparent from the report Delhi Cloth &amp; General
Mills Co. Ltd.  (1973 RCR 638) (Supra) and therefore
the various observations made by the Supreme Court
must   be   held   to   mean   that   a   tenant   is   required   to
comply with the entire order under <a href="/doc/559308/" id="a_22">section 15(1)</a> of the
Act to avail protection under <a href="/doc/367290/" id="a_23">section 14(2)</a> of the Act.  
</p>
<p id="p_13">The Supreme Court in para 9 has observed as under :
</p>
<p id="p_14">"  Now the question that remains is whether the Rent
Controller   has   any   discretion   texted   the   time
prescribed in <a href="/doc/1150627/" id="a_24">Section 12(1)</a>.  This section requires the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                9</span>
 Controller after hearing the parties, to make an order
directing the tenant to pay to the landlord of deposit
with the Controller within one month of the date of the
order, the arrears of rent with a direction that he should
continue  to  pay   or  deposit,  month  by  month,  a  sum
equivalent to the rent.   This is a second opportunity
given to the tenant to pay arrears of rent.  Without the
protection given under the Act the landlord can on 15
day's   notice   ending   with   the   month   get   the   tenant
evicted.  The Rent Control Act protects the tenant from
such eviction  and gives him an opportunity to pay the
arrears   of   rent   within   two   months   from   the   date   of
notice   of   demand   as   provided   in   <a href="/doc/367290/" id="a_25">section   14(1)(a)</a>.
Even if he fails to pay a further opportunity is given to
the   tenant   to   play   or   deposit   the   arrears   within   one
month under <a href="/doc/559308/" id="a_26">section 15(1)</a>.   Such payment or deposit
in complying with the order under <a href="/doc/559308/" id="a_27">section 15(1)</a> takes
away   the   right   of   the   landlord   to   claim   recovery   of
possession   on   the   ground   of   default   in   payments   of
rent.  The legislature has given statutory protection to
the tenant by affording him an opportunity to play the
arrears of rent within one month from the date of the
order.  This statutory provision cannot be modified as
rights   of   parties   depend   on   the   compliance   with   an
order under <a href="/doc/559308/" id="a_28">Section 15(1)</a>.   In the circumstances, we
agree with the Full Bench that the Rent Controller has
no   discretion   to   extend   the   time   prescribed   under
<a href="/doc/559308/" id="a_29">Section 15(1)</a>."
</p>
<p id="p_15">6. This observation of the Supreme Court concludes
the matter and therefore I am of the view that tenant is
required to comply with the entire order under <a href="/doc/559308/" id="a_30">Section
15(1)</a> of the Act i.e. he should deposit arrears of rent
within one month from the date of the order and also
deposit   future   monthly   rent   by   the   15th  of   the
succeeding month in order to claim protection under
<a href="/doc/367290/" id="a_31">Section 14(2)</a> of the Act.  There have been judgments
of this Court holding the same view.  In Smt. Darshan
Devi Vs  Vidya Nath 1969 RCR 478 there was dispute
about the rate of rent.  Interim rent was fixed requiring


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                               10</span>
 the   tenant   to   deposit   arrears   of   rent   at   the   rate   of
interim rent within one month and future monthly rent
at the said rate by the 15th  of the succeeding month.
Subsequently   the   standard   rent   was   fixed   and   the
tenant was required to depoist the difference between
the standard and interim rate of rent within one month
from the date of the order.  The tenant was required to
deposit   the   difference   between   the   standard   and
interim rate of rent within one month from the date of
the order.  The tenant defaulted in depositing the rent
at the rate of interim rent.  This Court held that tenant
ought to have complied with the order requiring him to
deposit at the interim rate as well as the order requiring
him to deposit the difference between the determined
and interim rate of rent.  In other words it was held that
the tenant was required to comply with all order passed
under   <a href="/doc/234547/" id="a_32">section   15(3)</a>   of   the   Act.     The   tenant   had
committed default and therefore, the order of eviction
was   passed   against   him.     In   Shri   Munshi   Lal   Vs
Thakur Prem Chand 1970 RCJ 496 V. S. Deshpande,
J. (as he then was observed as under:
</p>
<p id="p_16">" For the above reasons I find that correct construction
of   <a href="/doc/367290/" id="a_33">Section   14(2)</a>   of   the   Act   is   that   its   benefit   is
available to the tenant only when the tenant has made
the   payment   or   deposit   of   the   rent   as   required   by
<a href="/doc/234547/" id="a_34">section 15(3)</a> read with <a href="/doc/559308/" id="a_35">section 15(1)</a> and that such rent
includes not only the arrears of the rent but also the
rent becoming due subsequently".  
</p>
<p id="p_17">In Devi Dayal   Vs     Mst. Zamani Begum, 1975 RCJ
332 B.C. Mishra, J. held that a tenant to get protection
under <a href="/doc/367290/" id="a_36">section 14(2)</a> of the Act is required not only to
deposit the arrears of rent but future monthly rent by
the   15th  of   the   succeeding   month   i.e.   in   accordance
with the order passed under <a href="/doc/559308/" id="a_37">Section 15(1)</a> of the Act.
In Shri Madan Lal  Vs  Shri Hukam Chand and others
1977(2)   RCJ   643   Yogeshwar   Dayal,   J.   held   that
though the delay in deposit of rent was condoned for
the purpose of <a href="/doc/1987465/" id="a_38">section 15(7)</a> of the Act, the landlord


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                                11</span>
        was entitled to an order of eviction against the tenant
       for   his   failure   in   depositing   the   monthly   rent   in
       accordance with the order under <a href="/doc/1987465/" id="a_39">section 15</a> (1) of the
       Act.  He observed as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_18">       " It must, therefore, be held that inspite of the fact that
       the delay in depositing the future rent was condoned
       for   the   purpose   of   <a href="/doc/1987465/" id="a_40">section   15(7)</a>   of   the   Act,   that
       condonation does not ensure to wipe out the default
       completely   and   the   landlord   is   entitled   to   claim   the
       benefit of the said default, in complying with the order
       under <a href="/doc/559308/" id="a_41">section 15(1)</a> by the tenant and to claim an order
       for eviction as stated in <a href="/doc/367290/" id="a_42">section 14(2)</a> of the Act".
</p>
<p id="p_19">       7.             In the last three cases arrears of rent were
       deposited   within   one   month   from   the   date   of   the
       passing of the order under section15(1) of the Act but
       there were defaults in depositing future monthly rent
       by 15th of the succeeding month, meaning thereby that
       the   order   under   <a href="/doc/1987465/" id="a_43">section   15</a>   (2)   of   the   Act   requiring
       deposit   of   future   monthly   rent   by   the   15th  of   the
       succeeding   month   was   not   complied   with   and   the
       landlord   was   held   entitled   of   an   order   of   eviction
       against the tenant.  It was held that the tenant was not
       entitled  to  protection  under <a href="/doc/367290/" id="a_44">section 14(2)</a> of the Act
       although   he   had   deposited   arrears   of   rent   but
       committed default in depositing future monthly rent.
       Learned counsel for the appellant submits that <a href="/doc/367290/" id="a_45">Section
       14(2)</a>   read   with   <a href="/doc/559308/" id="a_46">section   15(1)</a>   of   the   Act   is   not
       mandatory but directory.  I do not agree in view of the
       Full  Bench   decision   of   this   Court   in   Delhi   Cloth   &amp;
       General Mills Co.Ltd. (Supra) and Hem Chand (Supra)
       decided by the Supreme Court where it has been held
       that the Rent Controller has no discretion to extend the
       time prescribed under <a href="/doc/559308/" id="a_47">Section 15(1)</a> of the Act.
