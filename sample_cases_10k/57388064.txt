07/29.08.2012</pre><p id="p_1">         Heard learned counsel for the parties.
</p>
<p id="p_2">                      Petitioner has approached this Court against the order

                dated 26.06.2006 passed by the respondent no. 2, Deputy

                Certificate   Officer,    Daltonganj   in   Certificate   Case   No.

                03/93-94 whereby objection petition filed under <a href="/doc/581845/" id="a_1">Section 9</a> of

                the Bihar and Orissa Public Demand Recovery Act, 1914 now

                adopted by State of Jharkhand, has been refused and distress

                warrant has also been issued.
</p>
<p id="p_3">                      Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that distress

                warrant could not have been issued simultaneously on

                rejection of objection under <a href="/doc/581845/" id="a_2">Section 9</a> of the Bihar and Orissa

                Public Demand Recovery Act, 1914 and the Authority has

                passed non-speaking order without taking into account his

                objection.
</p>
<p id="p_4">                      Learned counsel for the respondents, however, submits

                by referring the statement made in the counter affidavit that

                petitioner    was   a    responsible   member    of   Vishwakarma

                Industries Co-operative Society and demand was accordingly

                raised against him as he happens to be the Secretary of the

                said Co-operative Society for some period. Learned counsel

                for the respondents further submits that there is alternative

                remedy of appeal under <a href="/doc/7323/" id="a_3">Section 60</a> of the Act, 1914 and the

                petitioner has avoided the said alternative remedy in order to

                avoid deposit of 40 % of the amount.
</p><p id="p_5">                  Be that as it may, it appears that there is no interim

           order either in favour of the petitioner in respect of the

           proceeding before the Certificate Officer or the impugned

           order. In spite of the time having been granted earlier,

           learned counsel for the petitioner also does not have any

           instruction whether the certificate proceeding is pending or

           what is the present status of the case. In any case, if petitioner

           has statutory alternative remedy, it is open to him to take all

           such plea in law as well as the facts which are available to the

           petitioner and have been raised in the present writ application

           as well.
</p>
<p id="p_6">                 With the aforesaid liberty to avail the alternative

           statutory   remedy,   this   writ   application   is,   accordingly,

           disposed of.
</p>
<p id="p_7">                 Learned counsel for petitioner, further submits that the

           Appellate Authority may be directed to consider the question

           of limitation sympathetically.
</p>
<p id="p_8">                 Needless to say that if an appeal is preferred, the

           Appellate Authority may consider the question of limitation

           sympathetically in view of the fact that the petitioner was

           pursuing his remedy before this Court.
</p>
<p id="p_9">

</p><p id="p_10">                                            (Aparesh Kumar Singh, J.)
