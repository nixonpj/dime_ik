<pre id="pre_1">           HON'BLE SRI JUSTICE P. KESHAVA RAO
              CRIMINAL REVISION CASE No. 2548 of 2014


ORDER:
</pre>
<p id="p_1">      Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
      The present criminal revision case is filed challenging the

judgment dated 13.11.2014 passed in Crl.A.No.55 of 2013 on the file of

the Special Sessions Judge for Trial of Offences under SCs. &amp; STs. (POA)

Act, at Karimnagar, confirming the orders passed in DVC No.40 of 2009

dated 04.03.2013, in awarding a sum of Rs.5,000/- per month towards

maintenance to first respondent and her son.
</p>
<p id="p_3">
</p><p id="p_4">      The facts in brief are that the first respondent is the legally

wedded wife of the petitioner.        Their marriage was performed on

22.02.2007 at Karimnagar. At the time of marriage, the parents of the

first respondent gave Rs.4 lakhs, gold, furniture, clothes worth

Rs.15,000/- and other household articles worth Rs.1,40,000/- to the

petitioner and his family members.         After the marriage, the first

respondent stayed with the petitioner at Hyderabad.              They lived

happily for some time and thereafter the petitioner and his family

members started harassing physically and mentally demanding to

bring additional dowry of Rs.6 lakhs. When the first respondent was

carrying pregnancy, the petitioner has not taken care of her and even

after delivery, he has not changed his attitude and continued to

harass her.     Even panchayat held was also of no use.           Since the

petitioner completely neglected the first respondent and her child, she

was constrained to file the domestic violence case on the file of the

Additional Judicial Magistrate of First Class, Karimnagar claiming

Rs.10,000/- per month towards maintenance.              The petitioner filed
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                       2</span>



counter admitting the relationship with the first respondent, but denied

material allegations made in the domestic violence case and

contended inter alia that the first respondent is a quarrelsome lady

and she used to pick up quarrel on each and every trivial matter. She

used to comment on the income of the petitioner and used to leave

his house on each and every petty issue. The petitioner tolerated the

same with the fond hope that on one day or the other, she would

realize, but of no avail. He also stated that, in fact, the first respondent

neglected him. The first respondent demanded the petitioner to stay

back in her parents' house.       Though, the petitioner accepted and

stayed back in his in-laws' house, after some time again they returned

back to their house. Because of the attitude of the first respondent,

the petitioner suffered untold misery and he was humiliated and

subsequently he lost his job. Since there is no change in the attitude of

the first respondent, the petitioner filed a petition for divorce vide

FCOP No.24 of 2009 on the file of the Judge, Family Court, Karimnagar

and the same was pending. The learned Magistrate, after elaborate

enquiry by orders dated 04.03.2013 partly allowed DVC No.40 of 2009,

awarding a sum of Rs.5,000/- per month towards maintenance to the

first respondent and her son from the date of the petition. Aggrieved

by the said orders, the petitioner and others field Crl.A.No.55 of 2013 on

the file of the Special Sessions Judge for Trial of Offences under SCs. &amp;

STs. (POA) Act, at Karimnagar.       After hearing, the said appeal was

dismissed by judgment dated 13.11.2013 confirming the orders passed

by the learned Magistrate.        Aggrieved by the said judgment, the

present criminal revision case is filed.
</p>
<p id="p_5">
</p><p id="p_6">      Learned counsel for the petitioner would contend that the

orders passed by both the Courts below in awarding a sum of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                    3</span>



Rs.5,000/- per month towards maintenance is excessive and without

there being any material on record. Both the Courts below failed to

appreciate that there is no domestic relationship between the

petitioner and the first respondent. Both the Courts below ought to

have appreciated that the first respondent filed report of cruelty and

harassment before the Police, Sanathnagar within the jurisdiction of

Metropolitan Magistrate at Miyapur limits for the offences under

<a href="/doc/538436/" id="a_1">Section 498-A</a> IPC and <a href="/doc/751411/" id="a_2">Sections 3</a> and <a href="/doc/1023340/" id="a_3">4</a> of Dowry Prohibition Act and

thereafter the first respondent, exposed to mental disorder and she

was taken by her parents to Karimnagar, as such there is no domestic

violence.
</p>
<p id="p_7">
</p><p id="p_8">      Having heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and from

the perusal of the material on record, the admitted facts are that the

first respondent is the legally wedded wife of the petitioner.     Their

marriage was performed according to the rites prevalent in their

community and out of wedlock, they were blessed with son. As far as

the evidence of PWs.1 to 3 and Ex.P-1 are concerned, they

corroborate the version of the first respondent as far as the marriage

and the harassment meted out to her by the petitioner. Though they

were cross examined at length, nothing has been elicited to discredit

their evidence.    The petitioner himself examined as RW-1 and

supported his case, but failed to examine any other person in support

of his version.   On appreciation of the evidence, the learned

Magistrate, was pleased to found that the petitioner harassed the first

respondent physically and mentally demanding to bring additional

dowry and therefore, there was domestic violence. Now coming to

financial aspect and the earnings of the petitioner is concerned, in the

cross examination he has admitted that he is a software programmer,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                        4</span>



but because of the mental agony suffered by him due to the acts of

the first respondent, he lost his job and at that time, he was not doing

any job. To support his contention, he filed Ex.R-3 which is a relieving

letter from his employer on his resignation. A perusal of the said letter

would indicate that he has resigned for the job and the same has

been accepted by the employer. But, the said letter does not indicate

that he has been removed from the job. Apart from the same, though

the petitioner, has taken a stand that he lost his job, but because of

the qualification which he possess, it cannot be said that he is

unemployee and not doing anything. Be that as it may, even if the

petitioner is not doing any job, he being a highly qualified and hale

and healthy person. He is expected to maintain his wife and son. The

said moral as well as legal obligation cast upon, cannot be disowned

on the ground that he is a jobless person. In fact, this Court and the

Apex Court, time and again, on this aspect held that as long as the

husband is hale and healthy and possessing high qualifications, is

expected to maintain his wife and children.
</p>
<p id="p_9">
</p><p id="p_10">      Further, the lower appellate Court also after appreciation of the

evidence dismissed the appeal confirming the orders passed by the

learned Magistrate. In that view of the matter, the grounds raised in

the criminal revision case will not touch the aspect of either perversity

or there is any patent illegality on the face of the order. Since the

scope of revision under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_4">Sections 397</a> and <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_5">401</a> Cr.P.C. is very limited, this

Court is of the opinion that there is no irregularity or illegality in the

orders passed by the lower appellate Court.           Hence, there are no

merits in the revision and it is liable to be dismissed.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                     5</span>



</p><p id="p_11">      Accordingly, the criminal revision case is dismissed.


      Miscellaneous petitions, if any, pending in this criminal revision

case shall stand closed.
