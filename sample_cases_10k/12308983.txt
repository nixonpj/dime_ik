                      claimant, his earning power would be affected and hence, the Tribunal

                      has fixed the disability suffered by the claimant at 40%. At the time of

                      the accident, the deceased was aged 38 years. Considering the age of

                      absence of any documentary proof for his income, the Tribunal has

                      fixed the income of the claimant as Rs.3,000/- per month. For the

                      said income and multiplier of 16, the compensation for 49% of loss of

                      earning power is worked out to Rs.2,30,400/-
