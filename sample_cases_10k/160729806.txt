                             Ms. Jayeta Kaunda Mitra

                                         ...for the State.
</p>
<p id="p_2">                             Affidavit of service filed today be kept with the record.

                             The petitioner has filed the present writ petition for direction upon the

              respondent authority particularly the respondent no. 3, the Assistant Registrar of

              Cooperative Societies, Paschim Medinipur Range to consider and take a decision

              in respect of the petitioner's representation dated 27th June, 2017 (appears at

              page 46 of the writ petition).
</p>
<p id="p_3">                             Mr. Das, learned Advocate appearing for the petitioner submits that

              after complying all the formalities, petitioner was appointed as the Group 'D' Staff

              (U.R.) for the said Tatarpur Nekarbag Samabay Krishi Unnayan Samity Limited

              on 22nd August, 2016. Mr. Das further submits that the petitioner has regularly

              been attending the said Co-operative but unfortunately, he has been restrained

              to put his signature in the Attendance Registrar since November, 2016. Against

              such illegal obstruction, the petitioner made a representation before the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                          2</span>


respondent no. 3 which is pending for taking decision. Hence, the present writ

petition.
</p>
<p id="p_4">        Per contra, Mr. Basu, learned Advocate appearing for the respondent nos.

5, 6 &amp; 8 submits that the petitioner has not been appointed following due

selection process.
</p>
<p id="p_5">        Mr. Basu further submits that the signature appearing in the Attendance

Registrar is not the original one (appears as pages 36 and 38 of the writ petition)

which is also disputed by Mr. Basu.
</p>
<p id="p_6">            Mr. Basu further emphasizes by submitting that the Attendance

Registrar is for the attendance of the teachers and not for the Group 'D' staff.

There is no such Attendance Registrar in the Co-operative Society to put the

signature of the Group 'D' Staff. There is no school.

</p><p id="p_7">            Mr. Roy, learned Advocate appearing for the State authorities submits

that the respondent no. 3 may be directed to take a decision in respect of the

petitioner's representation after holding proper enquiry pertaining to the

petitioner's appointment to the said post.
</p>
<p id="p_8">            Considering the submission as advanced by the learned Advocates for

the parties and after perusing the records, I direct the respondent 3, Assistant

Registrar of Cooperative Societies, Paschim Medinipur Range to consider and

take a decision in accordance with law after holding proper enquiry pertaining to

the petitioner's appointment to the said post within ten weeks from the date of

communication of this order and after giving an opportunity of hearing to the

petitioner or his authorized representative and the Co-operative Society or its

authorized representative and communicate the decision to the parties within

one week.
</p>
<p id="p_9">      Needless to mention I have not gone into the merits of the case and all

points are kept open to be decided by the respondent no. 3, Assistant Registrar of

Cooperative Societies, Paschim Medinipur Range at the time of hearing in

accordance with law.
</p>
<p id="p_10">      Since the writ petition is disposed of without calling for affidavits,

allegations made in the writ petition are deemed not to have been admitted.

</p><p id="p_11">      With this direction, the writ petition is disposed of.

      There will be no order as to costs.
</p>
<p id="p_12">      Urgent photostat certified copy of this order, if applied for, be given to the

parties on priority basis.
