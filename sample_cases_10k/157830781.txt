ORDER
</pre>

<p id="p_1">1.     This appeal has been filed against the impugned judgment dated 03.11.2010
by which the Ld. Trial Court has decreed the suit of the respondent / plaintiff for
recovery of Rs.30,000/- along with interest at the rate of 18% per annum from the
date of filing of the suit till realization.
</p><p id="p_2">2.     Brief facts leading to filing of this appeal are that the plaintiff filed a suit before

RCA No.-28/10                                                                  Page No. 1/9
 the Trial Court in which he averred that he was having good personal and business
relations with the defendant for a long period. The defendant was giving work to the
plaintiff of stitching garments (kaj-button) from time to time on piece rate basis. It is
averred that the plaintiff was performing job work at the rate of Rs.1.75 per piece.
Payment used to be made by the defendant to the plaintiff immediately upon
completion of work. It is averred that business was running smoothly between the
plaintiff and the defendant but subsequently the defendant with held certain
payments. It is averred that plaintiff had completed work of 19,117 pieces as per the
orders of the defendant which was completed between 13.04.2007 to 03.09.2007 of
which the defendant assured to make payment within two weeks. It is averred that
between the said period the defendant issued 18 challans in the name of the plaintiff
and employees of the defendant who received the goods which clearly mentioned
that amounts are due and payable by the defendant to the plaintiff. Plaintiff has filed
the 18 challans in originals along with the plaint. It is further averred that plaintiff is
also filing 31 receipts which support the case of the plaintiff that he received goods
from the defendant for performing job work after signing the same.
</p><p id="p_3">3.     It is averred that upon the completion of job work of 19,117 pieces, plaintiff
was entitled to an amount of Rs.30,000/- which was payable by the defendant to him
within 15 days.      Plaintiff has averred that he lastly visited the premises of the
defendant on 24.09.2007 on which date defendant refused to make good the
outstanding payments. Plaintiff thus served a legal notice dated 25.09.2007 to the
defendant but the defendant has not tendered the amounts as claimed. Plaintiff
therefore filed his suit claiming recovery of Rs.30,000/- along with interest at the rate
of 18% per annum.
</p><p id="p_4">4.     In his written statement, the defendant has defendant has denied that the
plaintiff was ever provided any work on piece rate by the plaintiff. It is averred that
plaintiff has not filed documents to show that he performed the work of stitching of
kaj button for the defendant. After filing of replication, the Ld. Trial Court by order
dated 19.02.2009 framed the following issues:-
</p>

<p id="p_5">       "1.      Whether the plaintiff is entitled for the recovery of Rs.30,000/- from the

RCA No.-28/10                                                               Page No. 2/9
       defendant as prayed for? (OPP)
</p><p id="p_6">      2.        Whether the plaintiff is entitled to the interest on the aforesaid amount,
      if so, at what rate and for which period? (OPP)
</p><p id="p_7">      3.        Whether the suit of the plaintiff is without cause of action? (OPD)
</p><p id="p_8">      4.        Relief."
</p>

<p id="p_9">5.    Plaintiff examined himself as PW-1 and tendered his evidence by way of
affidavit Ex.PW1/A. He exhibited receipts of challans as Ex.PW1/1 to Ex.PW1/31
and delivery challans as Ex.PW1/32 to Ex.PW1/49. Plaintiff also exhibited the legal
notice as Ex.PW1/50. Plaintiff examined Sh. Avdesh Kumar as PW-2 who tendered
his evidence by way of affidavit Ex.PW2/A and proved his signatures at point A on
Ex.PW1/6,       Ex.PW1/15,     Ex.PW1/21,      Ex.PW1/22,     Ex.PW1/25,      Ex.PW1/26,
Ex.PW1/28, Ex.PW1/29 and Ex.PW1/31. Plaintiff also examined Sh. Suresh Tanwar
as PW-3 who also tendered his evidence by way of affidavit Ex.PW3/A.
</p><p id="p_10">6.    Defendant although filed his evidence by way of affidavit did not tender the
same in evidence despite grant of opportunities and his right to do so was closed by
the Ld. Trial Court by order dated 06.09.2010. Hence no evidence was led on behalf
of the defendant.
</p><p id="p_11">7.    After considering the material on record, Ld. Trial Court by the impugned
judgment decreed the suit of the plaintiff / respondent.
</p><p id="p_12">8.    Ld. Counsel for the appellant / defendant has argued that even though no
evidence was led by the defendant, plaintiff has not been able to prove his case for
recovery against the defendant.        Counsel for appellant contended that exhibits
PW1/1 to Ex.PW1/32 are allegedly receipts of challans placed on record by the
plaintiff to substantiate his claim that he was performing the job work of piece rate
basis for the defendant. He argued that the plaintiff has also claimed that Ex.PW1/32
to Ex.PW1/39 are the original challans issued by the defendant in the name of the
plaintiff to indicate that defendant has received the goods / readymade garments on
which he has performed job work on piece rate basis. Counsel for the appellant
argued that none of the documents placed on record indicated that any work was
performed by the plaintiff for the defendant or that the defendant had assigned any

RCA No.-28/10                                                               Page No. 3/9
 work of kaj button on job work basis or on piece rate basis to the plaintiff. Counsel
for appellant argued that the plaintiff who examined himself as PW-1 in his cross-
examination has stated that job work was being done by him on basis of Kaccha
bill / parchi which used to be torn after payment was made to the plaintiff. Witness
has stated that he does not have any copy of the same in his possession. Counsel
argued that when the plaintiff himself has stated that he does not have any
documentary evidence to prove that job work was performed by him, documents
Ex.PW1/1 to Ex.PW1/49 placed on record could not be relied upon as admittedly the
same do not evidence any transaction between the plaintiff and the defendant.
Counsel for appellant argued that Ex.PW1/1 to Ex.PW1/32 are in the name of M/s
S.B. Washing, Loni, U.P. which mention number of pieces of different items. The
same do not show that any material was given to Sh. Sunil for performing job work
of kaj button on piece rate basis worth Rs.30,000/-. Counsel for appellant argued
that Ex.PW1/32 to Ex.PW1/49 are challans which mention that the same were
drawn by M/s Sunil Kaj Button against Sh. Hariom (Press Man). He argued that
these challans nowhere connected the defendant to the same. Even otherwise
these challans only contain the number of pieces without mentioning any particulars
of any job work performed by plaintiff for the defendant at the rate of Rs.1.75 per
piece.
</p><p id="p_13">9.       Counsel for appellant then drew the attention of this Court to the cross-
examination statement of PW-2, Sh. Avdesh Kumar who has stated the bills
exhibited by him pertained to M/s Shyam Baba Washing, Loni, U.P. and that in his
that in his presence, no transaction has been took place between the plaintiff and
defendant. This witness further stated that he was not aware of the rate at which
plaintiff was performing work for the defendant. Counsel for appellant then argued
that PW-3, Sh. Suresh Tanwar in his cross-examination has stated that no
transaction took place between the plaintiff and the defendant in his presence and
that he was not aware of any transactions between the parties. Counsel for the
appellant argued that in view of the above evidence, suit of the plaintiff could not
have been decreed.
</p><p id="p_14">10.      Counsel for the respondent on the other hand has argued that the parties

RCA No.-28/10                                                          Page No. 4/9
 were not transacting with it ever directly. He argued that the plaintiff was dealing
with the defendant through Smt. Nisha, his wife and the defendant was dealing with
the plaintiff through his employee Hariom.
</p><p id="p_15">11.   I have heard the Ld. Counsel for the parties and have perused the record. My
findings issue wise are as under:-
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">ISSUE NO. 1</span>
<p id="p_16">12.   Issue no. 1 is whether the plaintiff was entitled to recovery of the amounts as
prayed for against the defendant. In order to prove this issue, plaintiff examined
himself as PW-1, Sh. Avdesh Kumar as PW-2 and Sh. Suresh Tanwar as PW-3.
Plaintiff tendered his evidence by way of affidavit Ex.PW1/A. Plaintiff has exhibited
the documents / receipts of challans as Ex.PW1/1 to Ex.PW1/31 and delivery
challans Ex.PW1/32 to Ex.PW1/49.       He has deposed on the lines of his plaint.
During the course of his cross-examination, plaintiff has stated that he was not
maintaining any books of accounts. He has stated that he was performing job work
on the basis of kachcha bill. He stated that he received a 'local parchi' from the
defendant along with goods received for job work. He stated that he was not having
any such parchi in his possession. He stated that there is no written agreement with
the defendant. He stated that bills which were sent by him were received by Smt.
Nisha, wife of defendant and employee of the defendant. He stated that the parchi
issued to him used to be torn after payment was made to him and he did not have,
in his possession, any copy of the same. He stated that he did not make any entry
of payments made by the defendant to him. He stated that defendant himself used
to calculate the amount due on the basis of job work done by him and the plaintiff
himself never calculated the amounts due from the defendant. PW-1 has further
stated in his cross-examination that it was correct that the challans Ex.PW1/33 to
Ex.PW49 were in the name of Sh. Hariom (Press Man). He admitted that the said
documents did not mention any amounts payable to the plaintiff. He stated that there
was no rate quoted in the same. He further stated that there was only mention of
number of pieces of shirts.
</p><p id="p_17">13.   In para no. 5 of his plaint, plaintiff has averred that the defendant had issued
18 challans in the name of the plaintiff and the employees of the defendant had

RCA No.-28/10                                                           Page No. 5/9
 received the completed goods / garments after kaj button work was performed by
the plaintiff. It is averred in para no. 5 that it is clearly mentioned in the 18 challans
that the amounts were due from the defendant. These challans, 18 in number, have
been exhibited as Ex.PW1/32 to Ex.PW1/49. Plaintiff in his cross-examination
himself has admitted that these challans do not have any mention of any amount or
rate. I have also perused Ex.PW1/32 to Ex.PW1/49. These challans are titled as
delivery challans which are drawn by M/s Sunil Kaj Button against M/s Hariom
(Press Man). These challans contain only number of pieces. These challans do not
indicate the nature of the goods or the purpose for which the challans have been
issued. Except number of pieces, nothing else can be deciphered from the same.
</p><p id="p_18">14.    Plaintiff examined Sh. Avdesh Kumar as PW-2. Sh. Avdesh Kumar in his
evidence Ex.PW2/A has deposed that he was working in the concern of the plaintiff
as kaj button machine operator and assistant w.e.f. August, 2006 to October, 2007.
Witness has deposed that plaintiff used to carry jeans shirt pieces to perform work of
kaj button from the defendant and that on the instructions of the plaintiff he also
used to carry shirt pieces from the defendant's concern. He identified his signatures
on the receipts Ex.PW1/6, Ex.PW1/15, Ex.PW1/21, Ex.PW1/22, Ex.PW1/25,
Ex.PW1/26, Ex.PW1/28, Ex.PW1/29, Ex.PW1/30 and Ex.PW1/31. This witness was
cross examined by counsel for the defendant. In his cross-examination, he stated
that he used to receive and deliver goods in the absence of plaintiff. He stated that
it was correct that the bills exhibited by him were in the name of M/s Shyam Baba
Washing, Loni, U.P. and that in his presence no money transaction took place
between the plaintiff and the defendant. He stated that he had never gone to the
defendant for receiving payments. Witness stated that he was not aware of rate at
which plaintiff used to work for the defendant and that he was not aware as to how
much work plaintiff had executed for the defendant. I have gone through the Ext.
PW1/1 to Ex.PW1/31. These documents are in the name of M/s S.B. Washing, Loni,
U.P. under whom name M/s Ajay is also written. All these documents mentioned
number of pieces of certain garments such as "China Monkey", "Plane Di" and "Ice
Bag". At the bottom of each document, name of Sh. Sunil Kumar is mentioned
under which there are certain numbers of pieces. There is not monetary amount

RCA No.-28/10                                                              Page No. 6/9
 mentioned in these documents. No rate for any job work per piece is mentioned. It
cannot be inferred from these documents that any job work was performed by the
plaintiff for the defendant at the rate of Rs.1.75 per piece for 19,117 pieces as
averred in the plaint.
</p><p id="p_19">15.    The third witness examined by the plaintiff is Sh. Suresh Tanwar as PW-3
who tendered his evidence by way of affidavit Ex.PW3/A in which he deposed that
the plaintiff was his tenant from June, 2005 to October, 2007 and running his
concern of stitching and kaj button. Witness deposed that he had gone along with
plaintiff to carry shirt pieces from the defendant concern. It is deposed that plaintiff
closed his business in October, 2007 and left his premises. PW-3 during the course
of his cross-examination has stated that he had never any conversation with the
defendant and that he was not aware about any transactions between the plaintiff
and the defendant.
</p><p id="p_20">16.    It is on the basis of this evidence that the Ld. Trial Court has decree the suit in
favour of the plaintiff. As recorded above, plaintiff PW-1 in his cross-examination
has admitted that he used to be issued a local parchi /kachcha bill from the
defendant which used to be destroyed after payment was made to him. In other
words, plaintiff has deposed that whenever he performed job work order for the
defendant, he used to be issued a parchi / kachcha bill which used to be torn by the
plaintiff after he delivered the goods and received payments. The record of
transaction of work given by the defendant to the plaintiff and execution of the same
was, as per the plaintiff, on this local parchi / kachcha bill. The same was destroyed
by the defendant every time he made payments to the plaintiff after receiving the
completed work of kaj button on the raw material. Plaintiff in his plaint has averred
that he complete work of 19,117 pieces w.e.f. 13.04.2007 to 03.09.2007 at the rate
of Rs.1.75/- per piece of which payments were due. If the version of the plaintiff is to
be believed that no payment was made by the defendant, the plaintiff should be in
possession of kachcha bill / parchi as proof of work which was performed by plaintiff
for the defendant. Plaintiff has stated that he is not in possession of these parchies /
kachcha bills since same used to be torn after payment was received by him from
the defendant. Plaintiff in his plaint has averred that he had filed 18 challans in

RCA No.-28/10                                                              Page No. 7/9
 original (Ex.PW1/32 to Ex.PW1/49) from which evidence of payments due from the
defendant could be inferred. In his cross-examination, plaintiff has stated that these
challans do not contain any mention of any amount or any rate at which work was
performed. These challans do not indicate the nature of the goods or the work
executed. PW-2, Sh. Avdesh Kumar employee of the plaintiff has stated that he was
not aware of the transactions between the parties.           He further stated that the
documents Ex.PW1/1 to Ex.PW1/31 issued in the name of M/s S.B. Washing, Loni,
U.P. He deposed that he was not aware of any monetary transaction between the
plaintiff and the defendant. PW-3 is Sh. Suresh Tanwar landlord of the plaintiff had
deposed in his affidavit that plaintiff was performing work of the defendant. In his
cross-examination, PW-3 stated that he was not aware of any transaction between
the parties.
</p><p id="p_21">17.      As admitted by the plaintiff during his cross-examination, documents filed by
him i.e. Ex.PW1/1 to Ex.PW1/31 and Ex.PW1/32 to Ex.PW1/49 do not contain any
figures of any amounts payable by the defendant to the plaintiff nor do the same
contain any rate or any quantity of the work performed by plaintiff. Plaintiff had
contended in his plaint that he was filing 18 challans from which evidence of
payments were due could be inferred. In his cross-examination, he himself admitted
that these challans do not mention any amount nor the same mention any rate.
PW-2 and 3 have stated in their cross-examination that they were not aware
transactions between the plaintiff and the defendant. In the opinion of this Court, the
evidence led by the plaintiff does prove that the plaintiff performed kaj button work
for the defendant for 19,117 pieces of shirt at the rate of Rs.1.75/- per piece. This
Court is thus unable to agree with the findings of the Ld. Trial Court on issue no. 1.
For the reasons recorded above, findings on issue no. 1 are not sustainable and are
set aside. Issue no. 1 is decided in favour of the defendant and against the plaintiff.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">ISSUE NO. 2</span>
<p id="p_22">18.      Issue no. 2 is the rate of interest to which plaintiff was entitled on the amount
of Rs.30,000/- in the plaint. Since the findings on issue no. 1 have been reversed by
this Court and decided in favour of the defendant, findings on this issue are also set
aside.

allowed. Impugned order is set aside. Suit of the plaintiff is dismissed. Decree
