                         W.P. 18737(W) of 2010
                               With
                         C.A.N. No. 4598 of 2012

                          Amal Kumar Sarkar
                               Versus
                     State of West Bengal and others

                     Mr. Malay Kumar Basu, Senior Advocate
                     Mr. Ashit Kumar Chakraborty,
                     Mr. Subhajit Panja,
                               ..for the respondent nos. 6 and 13.</pre>



<p id="p_1">                     In the writ petition the petitioner, an allottee of a flat in

               Phase-!, Kolkata Township Project as stated in paragraph-2

               of the writ petition and who is a member of the Payamanti Co-

               operative Housing Society Limited formed by the apartment

               owners, has prayed for a direction upon the office bearers of

               the respondent no.6 to forthwith issue information as sought

               for to enable him to mortgage his flat after considering the

               representations dated 2nd April, 2009 and 16th April, 2009.

</p><p id="p_2">                     In the application being C.A.N. No. 4598 of 2012 for

               amendment and/or addition of prayers to the writ petition,

               prayers have been made for payment of compensation for the

               damage caused allegedly by the respondent nos. 13 to 18.

</p><p id="p_3">                     None appears on behalf of the petitioner when the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                   2</span>

matter is taken up for hearing.
</p>
<p id="p_4">       Heard Mr. Malay Kumar Basu, learned senior advocate

appearing on behalf of the respondent nos. 6 and 13. It

appears that the petitioner by letters dated 2nd April, 2009 and

16th April, 2009, being annexures P-7 and P-8 of the writ

petition, has sought for certain information as to whether up to

March, 2009 he has any dues to the society. It also appears

that the petitioner had filed an application under the Right to

<a href="/doc/1965344/" id="a_1">Information Act</a>, 2005, seeking certain information, which

ultimately culminated in filing an appeal before the second

appellate authority under the 2005 Act which was rejected on

27th August, 2009 holding that as the society had furnished

information it was frivolous on the part of the appellant to

insist on getting information under the signature of the

secretary. It appears that the said order dated 27th August,

2009 is not under challenge.
</p>
<p id="p_5">       It also appears from the affidavit-in-opposition of the

respondent nos. 6 and 13 that replies were given by letters

dated 21st May, 2009 and 22nd May, 2009 informing that the

petitioner has no dues in his name. Therefore, as I find that

the respondent nos. 6 and 13 have provided information and

as I find the order dated 27th August, 2009 goes

unchallenged, no order need be passed on the writ petition.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                               3</span>

</p><p id="p_6">      Therefore, the writ petition is dismissed. Accordingly,

the application being C.A.N. No. 4598 of 2012 is also

dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_7">      No order as to costs.
