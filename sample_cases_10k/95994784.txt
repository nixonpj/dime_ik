<p id="p_1">Per Hon'ble Mr. G.K. Vyas, J.
</p>
<p id="p_2">Date of Judgment:                                 23/11/2017

     The instant criminal jail appeal has been filed by the

appellant (life convict) Pappu Ram, confined in the Central Jail,

Jodhpur, against the judgment dated 16th of May, 2003 passed by

learned Additional Sessions Judge (FT), Jodhpur in Session Case

No.25/2003, whereby the learned trial court held the accused

appellant guilty for committing offence under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_1">Section 302</a> of IPC
                                (2 of 9)
                                                            [CRLA-581/2003]

and punished him with sentence of life imprisonment along with

fine of Rs.500/- with default stipulation to further undergo fifteen

days additional rigorous imprisonment.
</p>
<p id="p_3">     Succinctly stated, the facts of the case are that on

16.09.2002, complainant- Mangla Ram (PW-.2) lodged a written

complaint (Ex.P.1) before the S.H.O., Police Station Soorsagar,

Jodhpur at 05.00 PM, upon which formal F.I.R. No.212/2002

(Ex.P/2) was registered on 14.09.2002. It was, inter-alia, alleged

that he owns a mining lease in Pabu Magra and Khetaram and

Pappuda Bheel were employed in his mining lease and prior to

this, they were working with Anand Kalal, and after completing

their work, being Aquitaine of Anand Kalal, they used to stay in

the room of Anand Kalal. On 14.09.2002 complainant met both of

them. Today, i.e. on 16.09.2002 at about 02.30/03.00 PM

Pappuda met him and told him that yesterday in the evening he

and one Kheta Ram consumer liquor and a trivial dispute arose

between them. Kheta Ram thereafter slept in the "Dhalia" (room),

however, in the night at about 10/11.00 PM while he was sleeping,

he inflicted injuries on the head of Kheta Ram, and on account of

injury caused on his head, Kheta Ram died. Pappuda further

disclosed that whole night he was sitting beside the dead body of

Khetaram    and    also   accepted        that   he   had   committed

mistake/wrong. On this, the complainant reached at "Dhalia"

(room) of Anand Kalal and saw that dead body of Kheta Ram was

lying there. Meanwhile, police also came on the spot. It was thus

averred that accused appellant Pappu Ram killed Kheta Ram.
</p><p id="p_4">                                    (3 of 9)

        On this written report, the police registered FIR and

proceeded      with    investigation.         During   investigation,   Sub-

Inspector, Police Station Soorsagar went on the spot and prepared

"Panchayatnama" of the dead body vide Ex.P/3 in the presence of

five witnesses. The details of the dead body were recorded vide

Ex.P/5. Site Plan (Ex.P/6) was prepared. Blood stained pieces of

stones and pieces of cement were also taken in possession.

</p><p id="p_5">        The investigation of the case culminated into the submission

of a charge sheet against the accused appellant and thereafter

after providing opportunity of hearing, charge for the offence

under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_2">Section 302</a> of IPC was framed against him on 28.01.2003.

The appellant denied the allegations levelled by the prosecution

and claim trial.
</p>
<p id="p_6">        During trial, to prove the prosecution case, statements of 22

prosecution witnesses were recorded and 28 documents and 5

articles were exhibited from the prosecution side. After completion

of evidence of prosecution, statements of the accused appellant

were recorded under <a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_3">Section 313</a> Cr.P.C. on 12.05.2003, in which

he pleaded not guilty and said that he has been falsely implicated

in this case and nothing incriminating has been revered from him.

No defence evidence was led by him.
</p>
<p id="p_7">        At the conclusion of trial, the learned Addl. Sessions Judge

(FT),    Jodhpur      vide   judgment     impugned      dated   16.05.2003

proceeded to convict the accused appellant for offence under

<a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_4">Section 302</a> of IPC and passed sentence mentioned above. The

judgment dated 16.05.2003 is under challenge.
</p><p id="p_8">                                (4 of 9)

     Learned Amicus Curiae submits that he is not disputing the

occurrence and his precise argument is that as per evidence

available on record, the occurrence took place all of sudden due to

some quarrel when accused appellant and deceased- Kheta Ram

were consuming liquor, at that time injuries were inflicted by

stone. Therefore, learned amicus curiae argued that the ingredient

of holding the appellant guilty for committing offence under

<a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_5">Section 302</a> IPC is completing lacking in this case because there

was no pre-meditation or intention/motive on the part of the

appellant to commit murder of deceased- Kheta Ram and that the

incident took place in a spur of movement. He, therefore, argued

that the case does not travel beyond offence under <a href="/doc/409589/" id="a_6">Section 304</a>

Part-I of IPC and thus the finding of conviction recorded by the

learned trial court for offence u/s 302 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_7">IPC</a> may kindly be altered to

offence under <a href="/doc/409589/" id="a_8">Section 304</a> Part-I of IPC and the sentence awarded

to the appellant may be reduced to the period already undergone

by him.
</p>
<p id="p_9">     On the other hand, learned Public Prosecutor vehemently

opposed the arguments advanced by the learned amicus curiae. It

is submitted that the injuries were caused by the appellant on

vital part of the body and there is evidence of extra judicial

confession, which was further corroborated by medical evidence.

Thus, it cannot be said that offence under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_9">Section 302</a> of IPC is

not made out and more so, it is a case in which prosecution has

proved its case beyond all shadows of reasonable doubt.
</p><p id="p_10">                                  (5 of 9)

     We have considered the arguments advanced by the learned

counsel for the parties and gone through the entire evidence, as

also the findings arrived at by the learned court below.

</p><p id="p_11">     We have considered the statements of author of the FIR viz.

Mangla Ram (PW-.2) as well as other witnesses, namely, PW-.3-

Nar Singh, PW-.12- Surja Ram and PW-.22 Kishore, before whom

the extra judicial confession was made by the accused appellant

for causing injuries on the person of deceased in a quarrel which

took place all of sudden, while the appellant and deceased were

consuming liquor.
</p>
<p id="p_12">     To consider the prayer of the appellant to alter his conviction

from offence under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_10">Section 302</a> of IPC to 304 Part-I of <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_11">IPC</a>, we

have also considered the judgment of Arjun &amp; Anr. etc. etc. Vs.

State of Chhattisgarh reported in AIR 2017 SC 1150, in which

the Hon'ble Court held as infra: -
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">            "22. The accused, as per the version of PW-6 and eye
     witness account of other witnesses, had weapons in their
     hands, but the sequence of events that have been narrated
     by the witnesses only show that the weapons were used
     during altercation in a sudden fight and there was no pre-
     meditation. Injuries as reflected in the post-mortem report
     also   suggest   t h at   appellants   h av e   not   t ak e n   undue
     advantage or acted in a cruel manner. Therefore, in the fact
     situation, exception (4) under <a href="/doc/626019/" id="a_12">Section 300</a> IPC is attracted.
     The incident took place in a sudden fight as such the
     appellants are entitled to the benefit under <a href="/doc/626019/" id="a_13">Section 300</a>
     exception (4) <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_14">IPC</a>.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">            23. When and if there is intent and knowledge, then
     the same would be a case of <a href="/doc/409589/" id="a_15">Section 304</a> Part I IPC and if it
     is only a case of knowledge and not the intention to cause
                               (6 of 9)
                                                        [CRLA-581/2003]

     murder and bodily injury, then the same would be a case of
     <a href="/doc/409589/" id="a_16">Section 304</a> Part II IPC. Injuries/incised wound caused on
     the head i.e. right parietal region and right temporal region
     and also occipital region, the injuries indicate that the
     appellants had intention and knowledge to cause the injuries
     and thus it would be a case falling under <a href="/doc/409589/" id="a_17">Section 304</a> Part I
     IPC. The conviction of the appellants under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_18">Section 302</a> read

     As per the Jail Custody Certificates on record, the appellants
     have served 9 years 3 months and 13 days as on 2nd March,
     2016, which means as on date the appellants have served 9
     years 11 months. Taking into account the facts and
     circumstances in which the offence has been committed, for
     the modified conviction under <a href="/doc/409589/" id="a_21">Section 304</a> Part I IPC, the
     sentence is modified to that of the period already undergone.

</p><p id="p_14">     The Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of State of Rajasthan Vs.

Poona Ram reported in AIR          2017   SC   (Cri.)   144, while

considering the appeal filed by the State of Rajasthan against the

judgment dated 21.09.2005, did not accede to the prayer of State

to convict the accused respondents for offence u/s 302 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_25">IPC</a>, who

were convicted for offence u/s 304 Part-I of <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_26">IPC</a>, but while

considering the injuries and the fact that evidence of motive was

absent, altered the conviction from offence u/s 304 Part-II to

offence u/s 304 Part-I of <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_27">IPC</a> only. The following adjudication was

made by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case, which reads thus:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_5">                           (7 of 9)
                                                   [CRLA-581/2003]

     "5. On behalf of the appellant- State, we were shown
the medical evidence consisting of deposition of the doctor,
PW-24, who had found total 33 injuries, including fracture,
injuries on the head and on sixth to eighteen ribs. There was
lacerated wound on right lung. The death, in the opinion of
the doctor, was due to head injury and injury to the right
lung. The injuries were also found sufficient to cause death.
</blockquote><p id="p_15">On the basis of the same, it has been submitted that the trial
court committed no error in inferring an intention on the part
of the accused persons to cause death of the deceased by
inflicting so many injuries and, hence the High Court should
not have taken a lenient view as done in the order under
appeal. He further submitted that even if the intention to
cause death cannot be specifically and clearly attributed to
the accused persons, they ought to have been convicted for
the offence under <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_28">Section 304-I</a> and more stringent sentence
should have been imposed.
</p>
<p id="p_16">     6. On the other hand, Ms. Aishwarya Bhati, learned
counsel appearing for the respondents highlighted the facts
noticed above for submitting that in the absence of any
specific allegation as to who caused fatal injuries on the head
and ribs, all the accused persons cannot be held guilty of
offence under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_29">Section 302</a> IPC because it cannot be said with
certainty that they shared a common intention of causing
death. None of them had uttered any words to disclose such
a intention, nor had they come prepared for such offence by
carrying fire arms or any lethal weapon. She further
submitted that even if the allegation that the accused
persons were under influence of liquor is accepted, it does
not aggravate the offence and it will not be appropriate in
the facts of the case to hold that they all shared any
common intention of causing death.
</p>
<p id="p_17">     7. Having considered all the relevant materials and the
impugned judgment, as well as the rival contentions, we are
of the view that the High Court erred in applying <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_30">Section
304-II</a> to the offence at hand. <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_31">Section 304-I</a> of the IPC would
                                (8 of 9)
                                                       [CRLA-581/2003]

     clearly cover such an offence where the accused persons
     caused indiscriminate assault and some of the injuries
     proved fatal. By the rashness of their act, the accused
     persons must be treated to be fully in know of the
     consequence of their acts including possible death. Hence, in
     the facts of the case, we set aside the impugned judgment
     and order under appeal and convict the respondent Nos. 1 to
     4 for offence under <a href="/doc/409589/" id="a_32">Section 304</a> Part-I of the IPC. The facts
     of the case and the ends of justice require that the accused
     persons should serve at least eight years of rigorous
     imprisonment and also pay a fine of Rs.25,000/- (Rupees
     twenty five thousand) each and in default undergo further
     rigorous imprisonment for six months. We order accordingly.
     If the fine is realized, the same should be paid as
     compensation to the heirs of the deceased, if any."


     Upon consideration of the evidence of the case in hand and

the judgments of the Hon'ble Apex Court referred to supra; and

upon assessment of the evidence available on record, we are of

the opinion that the occurrence took place all of sudden in a spur

of moment, without pre-meditation and without pre-determined

motive or enmity, in view of above, it is a fit case in which the

conviction of accused appellant for the offence u/s 302 of <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_33">IPC</a>

should be altered to offence u/s 304 Part I of <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_34">IPC</a>.

</p><p id="p_18">     Resultantly, the present criminal appeal is partly allowed and

the conviction of the accused appellant for offence under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_35">Sections

302</a> of IPC is hereby quashed and set aside because as per

evidence of prosecution, it is a case of culpable homicide not

amounting to murder, therefore, conviction of appellant u/s 302

<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_36">IPC</a> is hereby altered to offence under <a href="/doc/409589/" id="a_37">Section 304</a> Part I of IPC.

Accordingly, the sentence of life imprisonment is hereby reduced
