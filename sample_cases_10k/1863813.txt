ACT:
Central Excise and <a href="/doc/53524/" id="a_1">Salt Act</a> 1944--S. 3--Concessional rate of
duty   on    matches  granted	to   smaller   Units-Whether
discriminatory.



HEADNOTE:
For the purpose of levy of excise duty match factories	were
classified   by	 the  Government  on  the  basis  of   their
production  during a financial year, the higher	 rate  being
levied	on  matches produced in factories  having  a  higher
output.	 In 1967, in place of classification on the basis of
production,   a	 higher	 rate,	for  matches   produced	  on
mechanised  units  and a lower rate on matches	produced  on
non-mechanised	units 'was adopted.  In the case of  cottage
units and units on co-operative basis a concessional rate of
duty  was  levied.   The  notification	of  July  21,	1967
contained a proviso to the effect that if a manufacturer was
to  give a declaration that the total clearance	 of  matches
from  a	 factory  would	 not, exceed  75  million  during  a
financial  Year he would be entitled to a concessional	rate
of  duty.  This notification enabled the manufacturers	with
higher capacity to avail of the concessional rate of duty by
filing	a  declaration as visualised in the proviso  to	 the
notification  by restricting their clearance to	 75  million
matches.  To avoid such a contingency the notification dated
21st July, 1967 was amended on September 4, 1967 with a view
to give bona fide small manufacturers, whose total clearance
was not estimated to be in excess of 75 million matches, the
concessional rate of duty prescribed under the	notification
dated  July 21, 1967.  The respondent applied for a  licence
for  manufacturing matches on September 5, 1967 and filed  a
declaration that the estimated manufacture for the financial
year  would  not  exceed 75 million matches,  but  this	 was
rejected.   In ,its Writ Petition before the High  Court  it
was  contended	that it had been denied the benefit  of	 the
concessional rate of duty on the ground that it applied	 for
a  licence  and filed the declaration only a day  after	 the
date  mentioned in clause (b) of the notification  and	that
that  was  discriminatory.   The High Court  held  that	 the
classification was unreasonable inasmuch as the fixation  of
the  date  for making a declaration had no  nexus  with	 the
object of the Act.
Allowing the appeals.
HELD  : (1) The reasoning of the High Court is not  correct.
The  purpose behind the proviso is to enable only bona	fide
small manufacturers of matches to earn a concessions rate of
by  filing the declaration.  The small	manufacturers  whose
estimated  clearance  in  a year was less  than	 75  million
matches, would have availed themselves of the opportunity by
making	the declaration as early as possible as	 they  would
become	entitled to the concessional rate of duty  on  their
clearance   from   time	 to  time.   The  purpose   of	 the
notification was to prevent larger units who were  producing
and  clearing more than 100 million matches in a  year	and,
who  could  not have made a declaration, from  splitting  up
into  smaller units in order to avail the concessional	rate
of  duty  by making the	 declaration  subsequently.  [577FG;
578BC]
(2)In the matter of granting concession or exemption  from
tax  the Government has a wide latitude of  discretion.	  It
need  not give exemption or concession to everyone in  order
that  it may grant the same to some.  That a  classification
can  be founded on a particular date and yet be	 reasonable,
has been held in several decisions. [578G-H]

(3)  The  choice  of a date as a  basis	 for  classification
cannot	always be dubbed as arbitrary even if no  particular
reason	is forthcoming for the choice unless it is shown  to
be capricious or whimsical in the circumstances. [579B]

Arguments for the Appellants:
The impugned notification dated 4th September, 1967 does not
violate	 <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_5">article 14</a> of the Constitution.   All	applications
for  licences  and  declaration were  filed  after  the	 4th
September  1967	 and therefore none of the  respondents	 was
entitled  to  any exemption in view of clause  (ID)  of	 the
notification.  The history of the match industry shows	that
there  was a recognised tendency on the part of	 the  bigger
units  to  split up themselves into smaller  units  for	 the
purpose	 of  availing exemption from excise duty  which	 was
really intendea for the benefit of bona fide smaller  Units.
The  object of the notifications was to assist	the  smaller
manufacturers  with  less  duty and  secondly  to  help	 two
classes	 of  manufacturers  with still lesser  duty  and  to
extend	the  exemption	to all manufacturers  who  made	 the
necessary  declaration.	  The declaration  was	intended  to
safeguard the interests of the genuine smaller manufacturers
as  far as possible.  The object of the	 notification  dated
4th  September, 1967 was to further safeguard the  interests
of  existing  bona fide small manufacturers  for  preventing
fragmentation  of  larger manufacturing units in  future  in
order  to  benefit at the expense of  the  existing  smaller
units.	 The fixing of the date of the notification  as	 the
dividing line and limiting the exemption to those who  filed
the  requisite	declaration is not arbitrary.	It  is	well
settled	 that there must be a great deal of  flexibility  in
the  incidence of taxation, in the case of a taxing  statute
the  legislature  has a wider discretion in  selecting	the,
objects, persons and the methods; the legislature  possesses
larger freedom regarding classification, the  classification
of  transactions  with reference to a date is valid;  and  a
rule which makes a difference between. past and present does
not violate <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_6">article 14</a> of Constitution.
Arguments for the respondents:
While  the earlier Notification No. 162 of 1969 dated  21-7-
1967 did not put any time limit, the later Notification	 No.
205  of	 1967 dated 4-9-1967 sets an  arbitrary	 time  limit
making	 discrimination	  between  the	same   category	  of
manufacturers simply on the basis of the applications  being
before	or after 4-9-1967.  The fixation of 4-9-1967 as	 the
dividing  line	is-arbitrary and it does not relate  to	 the
object of the Act and the Rules contained therein.
The fact that in one case declaration has been filed  before
the specified date and in the other no such declaration	 has
been filed does not provide the, basis for any	intelligible
differentia  between  the  two	sets  of  manufacturers	  of
matches.  There is no rational basis for such classification
which  is arbitrary in the sense that it does not relate  to
the  fiscal  object of the Central Exercise  and  <a href="/doc/53524/" id="a_7">Salt	Act</a>,
1944.	Classification	on  the	 basis	of  presentation  of
application  before  or	 after the  specified  date  without
reference to production or manufacture of goods but by	mere
reference  to  the presentation of  applications  before  or
after	4-9-1967   is  arbitrary  and	unreasonable.	 The
respondents   are  similarly  placed  with  those  who	 had
submitted their applications prior to 4-9-1967 but commenced
production after the said date.

The Judgment of the Court was delivered by
MATHEW,	 J. In these appeals, the facts are similar and	 the
question  for  consideration is same.  We will take  up	 for
consideration  the  appeal filed by the writ  petitioner  in
Writ  Petition	No.  3838 of 1968  (hereinafter	 called	 the
'respondent')  against	the  common order in  all  the	writ

of  Madras  questioning	 the  validity	of  clause  (b)	  of
notification  of-  the	Government  of	India,	Ministry  of
Finance	 (No.  205/67-CE  dated September 4,  1967)  on	 the
ground that clause (b) is violative of the fundamental right
of the respondent under <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_8">Article 14.</a>  The High Court  allowed
the  petition  and this appeal, by special leave,  is  filed
against the order.
</p><p id="p_5"><a href="/doc/76749005/" id="a_9">Section	 3</a>  of the Central Excise and <a href="/doc/53524/" id="a_10">Salt  Act</a>,  1944	(for
short,	'the  Act') imposes excise duty	 on  manufacture  in
respect of items mentioned in Schedule I of the Act.   Match
boxes are mentioned in item 38 of the said schedule and duty
is  leviable on the manufacture of match boxes at the  rates
specified therein.  For the purpose of levy of excise  duty,
match  factories  were	classified on  the  basis  of  their
production during a financial year and, matches produced  in
different factories were subject to varying rates of  duty-a
higher	rate being levied on matches produced  in  factories
having	a'  higher output.  In 1967, the  classification  of
match factories on the basis of production was abandoned and
they  were classified as mechanised units and  nonmechanised
units  and,  by notification No. 115 of 1967 dated  June  8,
1967,  two rates of levy were prescribed i.e., Rs. 4.60	 per
gross  boxes of 50 matches each cleared in mechanised  units
and  Rs. 4.15 per gross boxes of 50 matches each cleared  in
non-mechanised	units.	A concessional rate of duty  of	 Rs.
3.75  per  gross  up to 75 million matches  was	 allowed  in
respect of units certified as such by the Khadi and  Village
Industries  Commission	or units set up in  the	 cooperative
sector.	  Notification No. 162 of 1967 dated July  21,	1967
superseded the earlier notification and the rate of duty  in
respect of non-mechanised units was raised from Rs. 4.15  to
Rs.  4.30  per gross boxes.  This notification	contained  a
proviso to the effect that if a manufacturer were to give  a
declaration  that the total clearance from the factory	will
not  exceed 75 million matches during a financial year,	 the
manufacturer  would be entitled to the concessional rate  of
duty of Rs. 3.75 per gross boxes of 50 matches each up to 75
million	 matches,  and	the quantity  of  matches,  if	any,
cleared in excess up to 100 million matches will be  charged
at  Rs.	 4.30 per gross, and, if the clearance	exceeds	 100
million	 matches,  the entire quantity	cleared	 during	 the
financial  year	 will  be charged to duty at  Rs.  4.30	 per
gross.	   This	  notification,	  however,    enabled	 the
manufacturers  with  a	capacity to produce  more  than	 100
million matches and who were clearing more than 100  million
matches during the previous years to avail of the-L319SCI/75
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">576</span>
concessional rate of duty at Rs. 3.75 per gross by filing  a
declaration as visualized in the proviso to the notification
by restricting their clearance to 75 million matches.	This
would  have defeated the  very purpose of the  notification,
namely, the grant of concessional rate of duty only to small
manufacturers.	In order to avert this tendency on the	part
of  the larger units, the notification dated July  21,	1967
was amended by notification No. 205 of 1967 dated  September
4, 1967.  The notification reads :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">	      "In  exercise of the powers conferred by	sub-

of  duty  prescribed under the notification dated  July	 21,
1967.	The manufacturers who came to the field	 after	Sep-

68 would not exceed 75 million matches.	 It
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">577</span>
was on this basis that the respondent sought to restrain the
appellants from recovering excise duty in excess of Rs. 3.75
per  gross  of	boxes of 50 matches each up  to	 75  million
matches	 by  challenging the validity of clause (b)  of	 the
notification.
</p><p id="p_8">The  contention of the respondent before the High Court	 was
that it has been denied the benefit of the concessional rate
of duty on the ground that it applied for 'licence and filed
the  declaration only on September 5, 1967, a day after	 the
date  mentioned in clause (b) of the aforesaid	notification
and that was discriminatory.
</p><p id="p_9">The  High Court was of the view that the classification	 was
unreasonable inasmuch as the fixation of the date for making
the  declaration, namely, September 4, 1967 as the basis  of
the  classification  between those who are entitled  to	 the
benefit	 of the concessional rate of duty and those who	 are
not  so entitled, has no nexus with the object of  the	Act.
The  High Court said that all manufacturers whose  estimated
production  would  not	exceed 75  million  matches  in	 the
financial  year 1967-68 would fall under one class  and	 the
fact  that  some  among them filed  the	 declaration  before
September  4, 1967 is not a differentia having a nexus	with
the object of the Act for putting that-in a different Class.
The High Court, therefore, came to the conclusion that there
was  no difference between the two classes of  manufacturers
from  the point of view of revenue as they were all en	aged
in production of matches and as none of them was expected to
produce	 in the financial year more than 75 million  matches
on an estimate.
</p><p id="p_10">We  do	not think that the reasoning of the  High  Court  is
correct.  It may be noted that it was by the proviso in	 the
notification dated July 21, 1967 that it was made  necessary
that  a declaration should be filed by a  manufacturer	that
the total clearance from the factory during a financial year
is  not estimated to exceed 75 million matches in  order  to
earn the concessional rate of Rs. 3.75 per gross boxes of 50
matches	 each.	The proviso, however, did not say, when	 the
declaration  should  be	 filed.	  The  purpose	behind	that
proviso was to enable only bona fide small manufacturers  of
matches to earn the concessional rate of duty by filling the
declaration.	All  small  manufacturers  whose   estimated
clearance  was	less  than 75  million	matches	 would	have
availed	 themselves  of	 the  opportunity  by  making	the,
declaration  as	 early	as possible  as	 they  would  become
entitled-to the concessional rate of duty on their clearance
from  time  to time.  If is difficult to  imagine  that	 any
manufacturer  whose  estimated total  clearance	 during	 the
financial year did not exceed 75 million matches would	have
failed to avail of the concessional rate on their clearances
by filing the declaration at the earliest possible date.  As
already	 stated,  the respondent filed its  application	 for
licence	 on  September 5, 1967 and made the  declaration  on
that  date.  The concessional rate of duty was intended	 for
small  bona  fide  units  who were in  the  field  when	 the
notification  dated September 4, 1967 was issued,  the	con-
cessional  rate was not intended to benefit the large  units
which	had  split  up	into  smaller  units  to  earn	 the
concession.   The  tendency  towards  fragmentation  of	 the
bigger	units  into  smaller  ones  in	order  to  earn	 the
concessional rate of duty has been noted by the Tariff	Com-
mission in its report (see the extract from the report given
at p. 500
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">578</span>
in <a href="/doc/1730815/" id="a_11">M. Match Works v. Assistant Collector, Central Excise</a>.(1)
The whole object of the notification dated September 4, 1967
was  to	 prevent further fragmentation of the  bigger  units
into  smaller ones in order to get the concessional rate  of
duty  intended	for the smaller units and  thus	 defeat	 the
purpose	 which the Government had in view.  In other  words,
the  purpose of the notification was to prevent	 the  larger
units who were producing and clearing more than loo  million
matches in the financial year 1967-68 and who could not have
made  the declaration, from splitting up into smaller  units
in order to avail of the concessional rate of duty by making
the declaration subsequently.  To achieve that purpose,	 the
Government chose September 4, 1967, as the date before which
the declaration should be filed.  There can be no doubt that
any date chosen for the purpose would, to a certain  extent,
be arbitrary.  That is inevitable.
</p><p id="p_11">Rule  8	 of  the  Central Excise  Rules,  1944,	 made  under
<a href="/doc/720653/" id="a_12">sections 6</a>, <a href="/doc/53524/" id="a_13">12</a> and <a href="/doc/53524/" id="a_14">37</a> of the Act reads :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_8">	      "Power  to  authorise exemption from  duty  in
	      special  cases-(1) The Central Government	 may
	      from  time  to time, by  notification  in	 the
	      Official	Gazette,  exempt  subject  to	such
	      conditions   as  may  be	specified   in	 the
	      notification  any	 excisable  goods  from	 the
	      whole  or	 any part of duty leviable  on	such
	      goods.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_9">	      (2)   The	 Central  Board of  Revenue  may  by
	      special  order  in each case exempt  from	 the
	      payment  of  duty, under circumstances  of  an
	      exceptional nature an excisable goods."
</blockquote><p id="p_12">The  concessional  rate of duty can be availed	of  only  by
those  who satisfy the conditions which have been laid	down
under	the   notification.   The  respondent  was   not   a
manufacturer before September 4, 1967 as it had applied	 for
licence only on September 5, 1967 and it could not have made
a  declaration	before	September 4,  1967  that  its  total
clearance for the financial year 1967-68 is not estimated to
exceed	75  million  matches.  In  the	matter	of  granting
concessions or exemption from tax, the Government has a wide
latitude  of  discretion.   It need not	 give  exemption  or
concession  to everyone in order that it may grant the	same
to   some.   As	 we  said,  the	 object	 of   granting	 the
concessional rate of duty was to, protect the smaller  units
in the industry from the competition by the larger ones	 and
that object would have been frustrated, if, by adopting	 the
device	of fragmentation, the larger units could become	 the
ultimate beneficiaries of the bounty.  That a classification
can  be founded on a particular date and yet be	 reasonable,
has  been held by this Court in several decisions (see	<a href="/doc/1769227/" id="a_15">M/s.
