(By Lex Plexus, Advocates for R1;
 R2 served)

       This MFA is filed U/S 173(1) of <a href="/doc/785258/" id="a_1">MV Act</a> against the
judgment and award dated:13/08/2009 passed in MVC
No.2332/2008 on the file of the VII Additional Judge, Court
of Small Causes and Member, Motor Accident Claims
Tribunal-3, Bangalore (SCCH-3), partly allowing the claim
petition for compensation and seeking enhancement of
compensation.

      This M.F.A. coming on for           Hearing   this   day,
N.K. PATIL J, delivered the following:

                      :J U D G M E N T:
</pre>
<p id="p_1">      This is a claimant's appeal against the impugned

judgment and award dated 13/08/2009 passed in MVC

No.2332/2008 by the VII Additional Judge, Court of Small

Causes and Member, Motor Accident Claims Tribunal-3, ,

Bangalore (SCCH-3), ( for short ' Tribunal'), for enhancement

of compensation, on the ground that, the compensation of

`1,03,000/- awarded by the Tribunal under different heads

with interest at 7.5% p.a., from the date of petition till the

date of deposit as against the claim of the appellant for a

sum of `20,00,000/- on account of the injuries sustained
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                 3</span>




by him in the road traffic accident is inadequate and it

requires enhancement.
</p>
<p id="p_2">      2. In brief, the facts of the case are:
</p>
<p id="p_3">      The appellant claims to be aged about 30 years at the

time of the accident. He was        hale and healthy prior to the

accident. He met with an accident that occurred on

29.1.2008, at about 3.00 p.m. while he was walking on

Bannerghatta    Main     Road       near   Sampangiramanagar,

Bangalore, on account of rash and negligent driving by the

driver of the Tempo bearing No.KA.51.3743 and sustained

bleeding injuries to his head and other parts of the body.

Immediately, he was shifted to NIMHANs hospital, after first

aid, he was referred to Victoria Hospital, where he took

treatment as inpatient from 29.1.2008 to 4.2.2008 and

thereafter, on the advise of the Doctor he has taken bed rest

and follow up treatment.
</p>
<p id="p_4">      3. It is the further case of the appellant that he spent

considerable amount towards medical and other incidental

expenses and on account of the injuries sustained by him

as referred above, he has got visual disturbances. Therefore,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                      4</span>




appellant    has filed a claim petition before the Tribunal                ,

under <a href="/doc/136948773/" id="a_2">Section 166</a> of M.V. Act, claiming compensation

against the respondents.
</p>
<p id="p_5">      4.    The     said    claim    petition      had     come   up     for

consideration before         the     Tribunal. The Tribunal,           after

hearing both sides and after assessing the oral and

documentary evidence, has allowed the said claim petition in

part and awarded a sum `1,03,000/- as compensation

under different heads with interest at 7.5% p.a., from the

date of petition till the date of deposit

</p><p id="p_6">      5.    Being      dis-satisfied       with      the    quantum       of

compensation awarded by the Tribunal, the appellant has

presented     this         appeal,       seeking    enhancement           of

compensation.
</p>
<p id="p_7">      6. We have heard the learned counsel appearing for

appellant and learned counsel for Insurer.

</p><p id="p_8">      7. After careful perusal of the material available on

record at threadbare, including the impugned judgment

and award passed by the Tribunal, it emerges that, the

occurrence of the accident and the resultant injuries
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                 5</span>




sustained by the appellant as per Exs.P5 and 6-wound

certificates are not in dispute.          Ex.P6 issued by M.S.

Ramaiah Memorial Hospital discloses that appellant has

got visual disturbances secondary due to partial paresis

of 6th and 3rd cranial nerves resulting in significant

disability.   The   appellant       has    not   produced       any

documents to show that he is permanently disabled and

lost his eye sight permanently due to accidental

injuries. Further, it emerges that, appellant has taken

treatment as inpatient from 29.1.2008 to 4.2.2008 and

produced medical bills and prescriptions. The Tribunal,

after appreciating the oral and documentary evidence,

taking   into    consideration      the    nature     of    injuries

sustained by the appellant, the nature and duration of

the treatment taken by him,          the pain and sufferings

undergone by him during that period, the amount spent

by him for his treatment and other incidental expenses,

has awarded a sum of `50,000/- towards                     pain and

sufferings,     `11,000/-   towards         medical        expenses,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                               6</span>




`12,000/- towards loss of income during treatment

period, `10,000/- towards conveyance, nourishing food

and attendant charges, `20,000/- towards loss of

amenities and future unhappiness. In all, the Tribunal

has awarded a sum of        `1,03,000/-,   with interest at

7.5% p.a. from the date of petition till its deposit which

is just and proper       and therefore, it does not call for

interference. Nor we find any justification or good grounds

as such made out by the appellant     to entertain the relief

sought in this appeal.     Hence, the appeal filed by the

appellant is liable to be dismissed as devoid of merits.

Ordered accordingly.
