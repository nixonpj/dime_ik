   file   and   verify   the   present   petition.       On   28.03.08   the   respondent

   requested   the   petitioner   for   the   purpose   of   finance   under   loan   cum

   hypothecation scheme as respondent wanted to purchase a second hand

   car   and   accordingly   on   the   same   day   a   loan   of   Rs.1.50   lacs   was

   sanctioned   in   favour   of   the   respondent.     The   loan   was   repayable   for

   Rs.10,300/­ in first month and Rs.10,700/­ each for next 16 months.  The

   respondent   executed   agreement   of   loan   cum   hypothecation   dated

   vehicle was hypothecated with the petitioner.   The respondent failed to

   comply   with   the   terms   and   conditions   of   the   loan   agreement   and

   defaulted in the payment of loan amount and accordingly a notice dated

   21.08.09 was issued to recall the loan amount and with the direction to

   pay   the   remaining   amount   but   in   vain.     The   respondent   is   under   an

   obligation   to   surrender   the   hypothecated   vehicle   in   terms   of   said
