                 HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE P.K. LOHRA
                                  Order
08/12/2017

        Accused-petitioner has laid this second bail application under

<a href="/doc/1290514/" id="a_1">Section 439</a> Cr.P.C., arising out of F.I.R. No.131/17, registered at

Police Station Sardarpura, Jodhpur, wherein he is charged for

offence punishable under <a href="/doc/455468/" id="a_2">Sections 307</a>/<a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_3">34</a> IPC and <a href="/doc/1092263/" id="a_4">Section 3</a>/<a href="/doc/73862/" id="a_5">25</a> of

the Arms Act.




        First bail application bearing No.6238/17 filed on behalf of

petitioner was dismissed as not pressed on 3 rd of August, 2017

with liberty to file fresh after submission of chargesheet.




        Arguing on this second bail application, it is submitted by

learned Senior counsel Mr. J.S. Choudhary that after rejection of

first   bail   application   there   is   substantial   change   in   the
                                  (2 of 3)
                                                               [CRLMB-10179/2017]

circumstances inasmuch as upon completion of investigation

chargesheet in the matter has been filed. Learned Senior Counsel

would contend that, initially, in the FIR petitioner was not named

as an accused, nor his involvement in commission of offence is

revealed from the CCTV footage.              Learned Senior Counsel has

further urged that solitary witness, examined during investigation,

Mr. Arjun Singh though shown some involvement of the petitioner

in the alleged offence but his statements are recorded almost five

days after the incident, therefore, not inspiring confidence.

Learned Senior Counsel, while buttressing arguments on material

change   in    circumstances,    has        also   submitted    that    during

investigation no incriminating material is recovered from petitioner

and the pistol is recovered from co-accused Heera.                     Learned

Senior   Counsel    has   also   argued        that   no   witness      during

investigation has castigated the petitioner for use of firearm in

commission of offence.     Lastly, craving for grant of bail, learned

Senior Counsel submits that long incarceration of petitioner since

25th of June 2017, sans any criminal antecedent, is yet another

plausible ground for favourable consideration of his second bail

application.




     Per contra, learned Public Prosecutor Mr. Arjun Singh has

vehemently opposed this second bail application of the petitioner.

It is argued by learned Public Prosecutor that evidence is collected

against the petitioner during investigation to show his involvement

in commission of the charged offence. Learned Public Prosecutor

has also argued that while it is true that firearm was used by co-
                                     (3 of 3)
                                                              [CRLMB-10179/2017]

accused Heera in commission of offence but after the incident

petitioner     helped   him   in   fleeing     away   from   the   scene     of

occurrence.      He, therefore, submits that petitioner's second bail

application is liable to be nixed.




     I have considered the arguments advanced by learned

counsel for the petitioner as well as learned Public Prosecutor and

perused the available materials on record.




     Having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case and

relying on substantial change in the circumstances sought to be

canvassed vociferously by the learned Senior Counsel after

rejection of first bail application, without expressing any comment

on merits of the case, I feel persuaded to accept this bail

application.




     Accordingly, this second bail application under <a href="/doc/1290514/" id="a_6">Section 439</a>

Cr.P.C. is allowed and it is ordered that accused-petitioner, Sawai

Ram S/o Sh. Nakhta Ram, arrested in connection with F.I.R.

No.131/17, registered at Police Station Sardarpura, Jodhpur, may

be released on bail; provided he furnishes a personal bond of

Rs.50,000/- with two sureties of like amount to the satisfaction of

learned trial Court with the stipulation to appear before that Court

on all dates of hearing and as and when called upon to do so.




                                                         (P.K. LOHRA),J.
