<p id="p_2">               This is an appeal preferred against the order dated 11/12/2012 in

RCA No.106/2012 passed by the Principal District Judge, Gondia   thereby

remanding the suit for extending an opportunity to the appellant therein to

lead evidence in order to establish the location of the properties purchased

by the appellant and the wife of the respondent.

             Respondent herein has filed a suit for prohibitory and mandatory

injunction contending inter alia that he is the owner of the suit plot bearing

No.10   situated   at   Khasra   No.195/9,   T.S.K.   No.26   at   Katangikala,   Dist.

Gondia.  According to him,  he has purchased the said plot from Mangalabai

Damodar Bawne and  Mangalabai had purchased it from Laxman Gangadhar

Bedekar.     The   original   plot   was   admesuring   60'   x   40'   but   as   the   State

Government has acquired northern side of the said plot admeasuring 1400

sq. ft  Gangadhar Laxman  remained in possession of  only 1000 sq. ft.  i.e 40'

x 25' which he sold to Mangalabai.     At the time of purchase of the plot,

respondent had measured and marked the plot with stones and thereafter

bamboo fencing was erected.   However on 20/09/2007 respondent noticed

that   the   appellant   herein   had   made   encroachment   on   the   said   plot   and

thereby caused obstruction to his possession.    Respondent accordingly got

the suit plot inspected and measured through TILR and thereafter filed the

suit for prohibitory and mandatory injunction.

Exhibit-22 raising dispute relating to the location and area of the suit plot

and also about the boundaries of the said plot.  According to the appellant,

after puchjase of the plot No.10 by Gangadhar, the entire plot was acquired

by the Government for construction of the road and no land remained with

Gangadhar.   It was contended that though the sale deed was executed by

Gangadhar in favour of Mangalabai, and Mangalabai executed sale deed in

favour of respondent, in fact possession of the property was not given as no

property was in existence.   According to the appellant,  his wife Jayaben had

purchased   the   piece   of   land   from   Gat   No.198/2   and   Gat   No.199,

admeasuring 395 sq. meters from one Smt Khairunnisa w/o Javed Iqbal Khan

in the year 2007 and since then she is in possession of the same.   She had

also   converted   the   said   land   for   non-agricultural     use,     after   getting   it

measured by TILR.  She had got the plan sanctioned  from Municipal Council

of  Gondia for construction and  development.  As per said plan,  there is a

15 feet wide lane towards southern side of the said plot and thereafter there

is open space and then there is Ring road.  Thus according to the appellant,

there is no question of the appellant or his wife making any encroachment

and hence the suit filed by the respondent for prohibitory and mandatory

injunction was devoid of merits and was liable to be dismissed.   



</p><p id="p_7">3.           In   support   of   their   respective   contentions,   both   the   parties   led

evidence on record.   Respondent examined retired T.I.L.R. by name Manik

Warkade as PW-2 whereas appellant examined Chandrakumar as DW-3 who

had measured the land.

<p id="p_8">

</p><p id="p_9">4.           On   consideration   of   their   evidence,     in   paragraph   No.18   of   its

Judgment, the trial Court held that PW-2 Manik Warkade   has not carried

out proper measurement and the map (Exhibit-75)  prepared by him  cannot

be relied upon as he has carried out measurement  without locating a single

permanent   mark     and   simplicitor   believing   the   respondent-plaintiff   about

earlier existence of permanent mark at particular place.  It was further held

that it was the reason why T.I.L.R might had refused to sign on the map.

Thus trial Court found that the map prepared by PW-2 and filed at Exhibit-75

cannot   be   relied   upon   to   show   the   alleged   encroachment   made   by   the

appellant on the plot belonging to the respondent.  As a result, the trial Court

dismissed the respondent's suit.   
</p>
<p id="p_10">

</p><p id="p_11">4.            Against the said judgment and order, respondent preferred RCA

No.106/2012 and vide judgment and order dated 11/12/2012 the Appellate

Court was pleased to observe in paragraph 13 that as the real controversy

between the parties  was,  whether the property in possession of the present

appellant   is   part   of   Khasra   No.195/9   and   unless   this   fact   is   shown,   the

respondent   cannot   claim   any   relief.     It   was   further   held   that   in   order   to

resolve the controversy regarding the existence and location of plot No.10 it

is necessary for the respondent-plaintiff to bring before the Court, the proper

measurement map.  Accordingly liberty was given to respondent-plaintiff to

apply to the trial Court to appoint the Commissioner for measurement of all

the   properties   for   establishing   the   locations   of   the   properties   of   both   the

parties.     Learned Principal District Judge thus remanded the matter to the



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">          ::: Uploaded on - 22/06/2017                            ::: Downloaded on - 28/08/2017 05:13:08 :::</span>

trial Court for extending opportunity to the respondent-plaintiff in order to

establish the location of the property.    
</p>
<p id="p_12">             This   order   of   the   learned   District   Judge   is   challenged   in   this

appeal by learned counsel for the appellant-defendant contending that the

suit filed by the respondent was simplicitor for prohibitory and mandatory

injunction.     He has not claimed the relief of declaration of his ownership

over the suit plot.   The trial court has clearly held that the respondent has

failed to establish even the location of the property and his possession or

ownership over the said property.    Hence according to learned counsel for

the   appellant,   the   Appellate   Court   has   clearly   committed   an   error   in

remanding the   matter   to  the  trial   Court  and  that  too for   establishing the

location of both the properties.  It is submitted that,  in spite the opportunity

extended to the respondent to prove his possession or the ownership and also

the location of his property,  as he has not done so, there was no substantial

reason to extend one more opportunity to him to do so.   Reliance is placed

on the judgment in Chandrarao s/o Hanumantrao Wable vs. Dhondu s/o

Fula Patil 2012 (2) Mh.L.J. 847 to urge that once measurement is already

carried out by the TILR there is no necessity to extend opportunity to the

respondent for re-measurement of the land.  According to learned counsel for

appellant therefore the impugned order passed by the trial Court suffers from

illegality and perversity and hence liable to be quashed and set aside.   




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">         ::: Uploaded on - 22/06/2017                           ::: Downloaded on - 28/08/2017 05:13:08 :::</span>

</p><p id="p_14">5.           Per contra, learned counsel for the respondent has supported the

impugned order by submitting that the real dispute between the parties is

relating to the location and boundaries of the two properties,  one that of the

respondent and the other that of the appellant's wife.       The only way to

establish   the   location   or   the   boundaries   of   the   properties   is   the   joint

measurement of the said properties.       In this case admittedly PW-2 Manik

Wakade, the retired T.I.L.R   has   measured the property belonging to the

respondent only.  However, his measurement was not found to be proper and

correct and trial Court has disbelieved or not relied upon the same.  In such

situation,   to resolve the controversy, there was no other option before the

Appellate Court but to remand the matter for re-measurement through the

appropriate authority and therefore the impunged order does not warrant

any interference.  
</p>
<p id="p_15">

</p><p id="p_16">6.           In view of these rival submissions advanced before this Court and

from the perusal of the impugned judgment of the trial Court, it is clear that

the real dispute between the parties pertains to the exact location of the plot

belonging to the respondent which he has purchased from one Mangalabai

Bawane and the plot which is purchased by the appellant's wife.   As suit

pertains to the mandatory and prohibitory injunction,   it was necessary for

the respondent to establish his possession over the suit plot which he claims

to have purchased from Mangalabai.  The respondent has attempted   to do



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">         ::: Uploaded on - 22/06/2017                          ::: Downloaded on - 28/08/2017 05:13:08 :::</span>
 26-J-AO-52-16                                                                                  7/10


so,     by   getting   the   said   plot   measured   through   PW-2   Manik   Warkade.

However   the   trial   Court   has   rightly   found   that   PW-2   has   not   carried   out

proper measurement as he has carried out the measurement without locating

a   single   permanent   mark   but   believing   and   relying   on   the   statement   of

respondent alone about the earlier existence of permanent mark at particular

place.   The said witness has not even ascertained whether there was such

earlier   permanent   mark.     The   trial   Court   also   rightly   held   that   as

measurement carried out and the map drawn by PW-2 was not proper, even

T.I.L.R had refused to sign on the map.  Hence no fault can be found if the

trial   Court   has   refused   to   rely   upon   the   said   map   to   prove   the   alleged

encroachment on the plot belonging to the respondent.



</p><p id="p_17">7.            In   such   circumstances   the   Appellate   Court   rightly   held   that   in

order to prove that the respondent is in possession of the suit plot and the

said plot is distinct from the plot purchased by the appellant's wife, the joint

measurement  of   both  the   plots was necessary.   Accordingly  the   Appellate

Court   in   paragraph   13   of   the   judgment   has   clearly   held   that   the   real

controversy between the parties can be resolved only if it is shown that the

respondent's property is part of Khasra No.195/9 and therefore in order to

resolve the controversy it was necessary to measure not only Gat No.195 but

also 198/2A and 199.  As rightly observed by the Appellate Court in the same

paragraph that in order to resolve the controversy regarding existence and



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">          ::: Uploaded on - 22/06/2017                           ::: Downloaded on - 28/08/2017 05:13:08 :::</span>
 26-J-AO-52-16                                                                                    8/10


location   of   Plot   No.10,     no   evidence   was   adduced   by   either   side   and   in

absence of such evidence,   no relief can be granted to any of the parties.

Therefore in order to resolve the dispute finally, the Appellate Court thought

it fit to remand the matter back to the trial Court to give an opportunity to

the respondent-plaintiff to lead the evidence by getting the measurement of

the land carried out.  In my considered opinion,  therefore,  no fault can be

found in the impugned judgment and order passed by the Appellate Court.   



</p><p id="p_18">8.            As   regards   the   judgment   in   case   of  Chandrarao  v/s   Dhondu

(supra) relied upon by learned counsel for appellant,   the facts of the said

case were totally different because in that case, the measurement was carried

out by TILR who was in-charge of the office at Taluka level.  The plaintiff has

not made any grievance about the said measurement.  Hence  in absence of

such grievance, it was held that the trial Court was not justified in allowing

the   application   for   re-measurement,     that   too   when   the   recording   of   the

evidence was almost complete.  In the instant case the trial Court has found

that whatever measurement was carried out by PW-2 who is a retired T.I.L.R.

was   not   at   all   reliable   as   he   has   not   done   it   properly.     The   respondent-

plaintiff cannot be blamed for the same and therefore joint re-measurement

of the plots belonging to the respondent and appellant's wife had become

necessary.

</p><p id="p_21">9.            At this stage, learned counsel for the appellant pointed out that in

cross-examination,     respondent-plaintiff     had   admitted   that   both   the

measurements,  taken by PW-2 and DW-3 are correct.  The real controversy

between the parties, cannot be resolved merely because the respondent has

stated  that  both   the   measurements   are  correct.    Once   the   trial  Court  has

disbelieved   the   same,   there   is   no   other   option   but   to   go   for   joint   re-

measurement of both the properties.

reason for interference in the impugned order of the Appellate Court.



</p><p id="p_24">12.            Before concluding,  one more submission by the learned counsel

for the appellant needs to be taken into consideration.   It is submitted by

learned counsel for the appellant that though the matter was remanded to

the trial Court in the year 2012, as on today also the properties are not re-

measured.   In view thereof, learned counsel for the respondent submits that

proper steps would be taken as early as possible.       It is pointed out that

record and proceedings of the suit,  which was called for in this Court is not

yet sent to the trial Court.   Therefore it appears that no progress could be

made in the matter.
