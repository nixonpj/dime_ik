    Tax Appellate Tribunal ("ITAT" for short), Pune Bench Pune in the Income Tax 
    Appeals arising assessments meant for the assessment year 2001-02 and raising

<p id="p_2">    2]    Counsel   appearing   for   the   appellant  and  respondent  agree   that  first  two 
    questions sought to be raised in all these group of appeals are covered against the 
                                  
    Revenue  by virtue of the  judgments of the  Hon'ble Supreme  Court.   The  first 
    question stands answered in the case of Hindustan Coca Cola Beverage P. Ltd. Vs. 
                                 
    Commissioner  of  Income-Tax,  reported  in  2007   (293) ITR   226  (SC).  Whereas 
    second question stands answered by the decision of the Apex Court in the case of 
    Commissioner of Income-Tax and Anr. Vs. Pranoy Roy and Anr., reported in 2009 
           


     (309) ITR 231     (SC).   On this backdrop the first two questions can hardly be said 
        



    to   be   the   substantial   questions   of   law   warranting   consideration   afresh   at   the 
    hands of this Court. 
</p>




<p id="p_3">    3]            Having said so, we are now required to consider third question, which 
    revolves around interpretation of <a href="/doc/380949/" id="a_2">Sections 234-B</a> and <a href="/doc/248374/" id="a_3">234-C</a> of the Act resulting 
    from the failure on the part of the assessee to pay Advance Tax which in our view 
    needs consideration. Hence appeal stands admitted to adjudicate upon the third 





    question reading as under:  
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_1">                  (iii) "Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the  case   and  
                  in law, the Hon'ble ITAT erred in not appreciating that the assessee 
                  had failed  to pay advance tax and hence <a href="/doc/380949/" id="a_4">section 234B</a> and <a href="/doc/248374/" id="a_5">234C</a>  
                  were rightly invoked ?

    identical lapse.   for the same lapse.  In his submission,  the lapse on the part of 




                                                                    
    the assessee/employee, having failed to pay Advance Tax made them liable to pay 
    interest, being compensatory levy under <a href="/doc/380949/" id="a_29">Sections 234B</a> and <a href="/doc/248374/" id="a_30">234C</a> of the Act for

    Act cannot be considered as payment towards T.D.S. Such payment can only be 
    considered as other payment made on behalf of assessee.  He further submits that 
    it was obligatory on the part of the assessee to make payment of the Advance Tax 
                                  
    under <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_32">Section 191</a> of the Act, as as stipulated under <a href="/doc/1768504/" id="a_33">Sections 207</a> and <a href="/doc/815039/" id="a_34">208</a> of the 
    Act   in   respect   of   amounts   on   which   tax   had   not   been   deducted   at   source   in 
    accordance with the provisions of Chapter XVII of the Act. He further urged that 
        


    on the facts and circumstances of the case the Tribunal has ignored the fact that 
     



    the central issue was not of interest but was that of non-payment of Advance Tax 
    eventually attracting compensatory levy of interest under Section 234-B and 234-
    C of the Act.   In his concluding submission, Mr.Gupta submits that the order of 





    the   Tribunal   is   palpably   erroneous,   wrong   and   perverse   based   on 
    misinterpretation of the provisions of <a href="/doc/633848/" id="a_35">Sections 234A</a>, <a href="/doc/380949/" id="a_36">234B</a> and <a href="/doc/248374/" id="a_37">234C</a> of the Act

    be levied only if an assessee is liable to pay Advance Tax but defaults in payment 
    thereof.  According to him, in the present case, the assessee was not liable to pay 
    Advance Tax at all as such there was no question of he being liable to pay interest 
    either under <a href="/doc/380949/" id="a_40">section 234B</a> or under <a href="/doc/248374/" id="a_41">Section 234C</a> of the Act.

    assesse's current income is required to be estimated and Income Tax thereon at 
    prescribed rate is required to be calculated as per <a href="/doc/1680603/" id="a_42">Section 209</a> (1) (a); and in 
    second step, income Tax deductible at source is required to be reduced from the 




                                                                     
    figure arrived at in first step above, and it is only if any balance is remaining then

<p id="p_17">    14]           Mr.Irani further submits that the entire tax on the estimated salary 
                                   
    income   of   an   employee   is   required   to   be   deducted   by   his   employer.     The 
    employee is not liable to pay Advance Tax.  Hence, assessee employee cannot be 
                                  
    subjected to interest liability under <a href="/doc/380949/" id="a_44">Section 234B</a> and <a href="/doc/248374/" id="a_45">Section 234C</a> of the Act. 
    Reliance  is  placed  on <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_46">Section  192(1)</a>  of  the  Act,  which  lays  down  that, every 
    employer,   who   is   responsible   for   paying   to   an   employee,   income   chargeable 
        

    under the head "Salaries", is obliged to deduct tax therefrom at the "average rate 
    of Income Tax".
</p>     



<p id="p_18">    15]           In the submission of Mr.Irani, the expression "average rate of Income 
    Tax" is defined in <a href="/doc/864989/" id="a_47">Section 2(10)</a> of the Act to mean the rate arrived at by dividing 
    the amount of Income Tax calculated on the total income.   Thus, an employer, 





    under <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_48">Section 192(1)</a> of the Act, has to deduct, by way of T.D.S., the entire tax on 
    the income of the employee.   In other words, the  entire tax  on the employee's 
    salary income would be deductible by the employer, and, as such, there would be 





    no liability on the part of the employee to pay Advance Tax and consequently, no 
    liability on the part of the employee to interest under <a href="/doc/380949/" id="a_49">Section 234B</a> and <a href="/doc/248374/" id="a_50">Section 
    234C</a>.  He submits that these propositions are fully supported by the decision of 
    this Court in the case of Director of Income-Tax (International Taxation) Vs. NGC 
    Network Asia LLC (313  ITR page 187).

<p id="p_19">    16]           In the submission of Mr.Irani, the Revenue's argument that <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_51">Section

    <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_52">Section 192</a> of the Act applies equally to non-resident companies.  
</p>

<p id="p_20">    17]           Mr.Irani,   alternatively,   without   prejudice   to   his   above   submission, 




                                                                    
    submits   that   in   any   event,   considering   the   fact   that   first   step   requires   an 
    estimation  of   current   income,   it,   thus,   follows   that   if   two   views   are   possible 
    regarding the taxability of a receipt in an employee's hands and if the employee, 
    under a bonafide belief regarding its non-taxability, excludes it from the estimate 




                                                      
    of his current income, there can be no question of his being in default of payment 
                                   
    of Advance Tax and consequently, he cannot be made liable for interest under 
    <a href="/doc/380949/" id="a_53">Section 234B</a> /<a href="/doc/248374/" id="a_54">234C</a> of the Act.  In support of this submission, reliance is placed 
                                  
    on   the   judgment   of   the   Uttaranchal   High   Court   in  CIT   Vs.   Sedco   Forex 
    International Drilling Co. Ltd., (264 ITR 320)   followed by this Court in NGC 
    Network Asia LLC (supra). 
</p>        


<p id="p_21">    18]           Lastly,   Mr.Irani   submits   that   in   any   event,   the   employer   company 
     



    having already paid interest under <a href="/doc/726238/" id="a_55">Section 201</a> (1<a href="/doc/1656199/" id="a_56">A) of the Act</a> on account of non-
    deduction,   by   it,   of   T.D.S.,   the   employee   Respondent   cannot   be   subjected   to 
    interest liability under <a href="/doc/380949/" id="a_57">Section 234B</a>/<a href="/doc/248374/" id="a_58">234C</a> of the Act.  In his submission, it is now 





    well settled that interest payable under the Act is compensatory in nature and 
    hence there cannot be a double recovery of interest by the Revenue.  Reliance is 
    placed on the judgment of the Supreme Court, in the case of Hindustan Coca Cola 





    Beverage P. Ltd. Vs. Commissioner of Income-Tax (293 ITR 226 SC) to contend 
    that deduction of Tax at Source by a payer and direct payment of tax by the 
    payee were alternative and not cumulative methods of tax recovery, so that once 
    there is direct payment of tax by the payee, the liability of the payer for interest 
    under <a href="/doc/726238/" id="a_59">Section 201</a> (1<a href="/doc/1656199/" id="a_60">A) of the Act</a> for default in deducting Tax at Source would 
    cease.

    19]            On the above premise, submission advanced by Mr.Irani is that, once

    respect of non/short deduction of T.D.S. on the employees' salary, the Revenue 
    cannot   seek   to   recover   tax   or   interest  in   respect   of   the   same   salary   from   the

    actually paid interest more than the demand made.

                    securities, etc., but the said provisions also apply to gross sums, the 




                                                                           
                    whole of which may not be income or profits in the hands of the 
                    recipient, such as payment to contractors and sub-contractors.  The 
                    purpose of the TDS provisions in Chapter XVII-B is to see that the 
                    sum which is chargeable under <a href="/doc/244871/" id="a_155">section 4</a> for levy and collection of 
                    income-tax,   the   payer   should   deduct   tax   thereon   at   the   rates   in 




                                                          
                    force, if the amount is to be paid to a    non-resident.  The said TDS 
                    provisions are meant for tentative deduction of income-tax subject 
                                    
                    to regular assessment.   (see <a href="/doc/1060613/" id="a_156">Transmission Corporation of A.P. Ltd.

<p id="p_67">                    The Apex Court further observed :
</p>

<p id="p_68">                    "Applying the above test, we are of the view that if the payments of 
        

                    home salary abroad by the foreign company to the expatriate has 
                    any connection or nexus with his rendition of service in India, then 
     



                    such payment would constitute income which is deemed to accrue 
                    or arise to the recipient in India as salary earned in India in terms of 
                    <a href="/doc/220452/" id="a_157">section 9(1)</a> (ii) (which is one of the heads of income).   <a href="/doc/220452/" id="a_158">Section

                    "Salaries", if it is earned in India, shall be deemed to accrue or arise 





                    in India.   In fact, <a href="/doc/220452/" id="a_159">section 9</a> explains the expression "is deemed to 
                    accrue or arise to him in India" used in <a href="/doc/1087444/" id="a_160">section 5(2)</a> (b). <a href="/doc/220452/" id="a_161">Section 9</a> is 
                    not only a machinery section, it has the effect of rendering a person 
                    liable to tax on incomes which do not accrue or arise or are not 
                    received in India but which are deemed to be taxable by virtue of 





                    <a href="/doc/220452/" id="a_162">section 9</a> which applies to residents and non-residents. <a href="/doc/220452/" id="a_163">Section 9</a> is,

<p id="p_69">    22]           It   is   thus,   clear   that   if   a   sum   is   to   be   paid   to   the   non-resident   is 
    chargeable to tax, tax is required to be deducted.

    23]            Having seen the aforesaid scheme of the Act and law laid down by the 




                                                                                                
</pre><p id="p_70">    Apex Court, the further question which needs consideration is : the consequences 




                                                                       
    of failure to deduct advance tax in whole or part or after deducting, one fails to 
    pay the tax under the Act, then such person is made liable to pay simple interest 
    at certain percentage for every month or part of a month on such amount from 




                                                                      
    the   date   on  which   such   tax   was   deductible   to   the   date   on   which   such   tax   is 
    actually paid in accordance with the provisions of sub-section (3) of <a href="/doc/1656199/" id="a_164">section 200</a>. 
    The said <a href="/doc/1656199/" id="a_165">section 200</a> creates an obligation on the person deducting tax to pay the 
    same within prescribed time to the credit of Central Government or as the Board 




                                                       
    may direct.  <a href="/doc/1656199/" id="a_166">Section 201</a> provides for consequences of failure to deduct or to pay 
                                    
    tax, whereas sub-section (A) of <a href="/doc/1656199/" id="a_167">Section 201</a> provides for liability to pay interest. 
    Now, liability to pay interest as stated under <a href="/doc/1656199/" id="a_168">Section 201</a> is on the person who 
                                   
    fails to deduct advance tax.  As against this, if one turns to the Chapter XVII of the 
    Act,   it   provides   for   chargeability   of   interest   in   certain   cases.     <a href="/doc/1656199/" id="a_169">Section   234-A</a> 
    provides   for   payment   of   interest   for   defaults   in   furnishing   return   of   income, 
         

    whereas <a href="/doc/1656199/" id="a_170">Section 234-B</a> provides for payment of interest for defaults in payment of 
    advance tax and <a href="/doc/1656199/" id="a_171">Section 234-C</a> provides for payment of interest for deferment of 
      



    advance  tax.       All  these  three sections create liability on the assessee to pay 
    interest for the default committed by him in the circumstances mentioned in the 
    said sections.
</p>




<p id="p_71">    24]            The   Apex   Court   also   had   an   occasion   to   consider   the   very   same 
    question with regard to the nature of liability of interest in the case of Dr.Prannoy 





    Roy and Anr. Vs. CIT and Anr.2002(254) ITR 755, wherein the Apex Court was 
    pleased to hold that interest charged under <a href="/doc/1656199/" id="a_172">Section 234A</a> of the Act is not by way 
    of   penalty.     It   is   levied   to   compensate   revenue   in   order   to   avoid   from   being 
    deprived of payment of tax on the due date.  Interest held to be payable where 
    the tax had not been deposited prior to the due date of filing of the income-tax 
    return.     In   other   words,   it   was   held   that   where   the   tax   already   paid   by   the 
    assessee was not less than the tax payable on the returned income which was 
    accepted,  the question of levy of interest under <a href="/doc/1656199/" id="a_173">Section 234A</a> does not arise.
