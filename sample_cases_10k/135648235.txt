<p id="p_2">

</p><p id="p_3"> 2.               The prosecution case is that on 09/01/2004 at about

 1.00 p.m. to 1.30 p.m. when the prosecutrix was returning after

 answering call of nature, having reached near the house of one

 Kailash Ambhore (PW-6), the appellant gagged her mouth and

 pushed her inside the said house and committed an act of forcible

 sexual intercourse with her. According to the prosecutrix, the

 appellant threatened her of dire consequences if she divulged this

 incident to anybody. She went back home after the incident and

 since she was threatened by the appellant, she did not mention the

 incident to anybody. Her parents had gone out of the place of

 residence of the prosecutrix for attending a marriage and when

 they returned on 13/01/2004, the prosecutrix informed them in

 the night and thereafter on 14/01/2004, the father of prosecutrix

 i.e. Gulabrao Ambhore (PW-8) lodged the report before the Police

 Station leading to registration of First Information Report (FIR)

 against the appellant under <a href="/doc/1279834/" id="a_3">sections 376</a> and <a href="/doc/180217/" id="a_4">506(II)</a> of the IPC on

 examination after registration of the FIR. Her clothes were seized

 by the Police and investigation was undertaken by the

 Investigating Officer (PW-9). Upon charge-sheet being submitted

 after the completion of investigation, the Sessions Court framed

 charge against the appellant on 09/06/2004 under <a href="/doc/1279834/" id="a_5">sections 376</a>

 and <a href="/doc/180217/" id="a_6">506(II)</a> of the IPC and the trial commenced. The prosecution

 examined 9 witnesses, including the prosecutrix (PW-7), her

 father i.e. the complainant Gulabrao Ambhore (PW-8), the person

 in whose house the incident occurred Kailas Ambhore (PW-6) and

 others. The medical examination reports and chemical analysis

 reports were also brought on record by the prosecution. In the

 statement of the appellant recorded under <a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_7">section 313</a> of the Code

 of Criminal Procedure, he alleged false implication.

 the evidence and material on record, it found that the prosecution

 had proved its case beyond reasonable doubt against the appellant

 and accordingly convicted and sentenced him.</p><pre id="pre_3">

 Advocate appearing on behalf of the appellant, submitted that the

 prosecution case was based only on the evidence of the prosecutrix

 and it was not supported by any other evidence on record. It was

 submitted that while the incident occurred on 09/01/2004, the

 FIR was lodged on 14/01/2004 and that the delay was fatal to the

 prosecution case. It was submitted that the person in whose house

 the incident had allegedly occurred i.e. PW-6 Kailas Ambhore and

 his brother Pramod Ambhore PW-5, who had allegedly reached the

 place of the incident after the act had been committed, had both

 turned hostile. The panch witness had also turned hostile. It was

 submitted that there was no medical evidence on record to support

 the prosecution case and the explanation for delay of registration

 of the FIR given by the prosecutrix PW-7 and her father i.e. the

 complainant PW-8, was not acceptable. It was submitted that the

 appellant had been falsely implicated because his family had

 refused the marriage proposal of the prosecutrix.

 submitted that the evidence of the prosecutrix PW-7 along with

 other evidence on record was sufficient to demonstrate that the

 impugned judgment and order was justified. It is submitted that

 the explanation for delay in registration of the FIR was supported

 by the version of the prosecutrix PW-7 and the complainant PW-8.

 It was pointed out that no material was brought on record

 regarding alleged false implication claimed by the appellant and

 that, therefore, the appeal deserved to be dismissed.



</p><p id="p_8"> 7.               A perusal of the evidence and material on record

 shows that the prosecutrix PW-7 has described the incident that

 occurred on 09/01/2004 in detail.           She has stated about the

 manner in which the appellant forcibly committed sexual

 intercourse with her.         The prosecutrix PW-7 has also stated in

 clear terms as to why the FIR was registered after about 5 days.

 According to the prosecutrix, her parents had gone out of the

 village for attending a marriage and when they returned on

 13/01/2004, she immediately disclosed the incident to them in

 the night. It was thereafter on 14/01/2004, that her father PW-8

 approached the Police Station for lodging the report. This version

 evidence has not been discredited in any manner although

 suggestions were made to her with regard to alleged illicit

 relations with a third person. A suggestion is also given to her that

 because the appellant had refused to marry her, the complainant

 PW-8 had lodged false report in the Police Station. In the cross-

 examination of the complainant PW-8 i.e. father of the

 prosecutrix, a suggestion was given that a meeting had taken place

 on 13/01/2004 wherein the proposal to marry the prosecutrix was

 rejected by the appellant. This was denied by the said witness. A

 perusal of the evidence of other witnesses does show that the

 witness PW-6 Kailas Ambhore in whose house the incident took

 place and his brother PW-5 Pramod Ambhore turned hostile. The

 panch witness for seizure of the clothes of the prosecutrix also

 turned hostile. The medical examination of the prosecutrix shows

 that it was conducted on 14/01/2004 at about 6.30 p.m. i.e. 5

 days after the incident.      A perusal of the medical examination

 report shows that there was a tear on the hymen but no injuries

 reports concerning the clothes and the undergarments of the

 semen that was found to be human but, the results were

 inconclusive.

 prosecution case hinges completely on the evidence of the

 prosecutrix PW-7 and her father, complainant i.e. PW-8. A perusal

 of the evidence of the said witnesses shows that the prosecutrix

 described the incident in detail and in the cross-examination her

 evidence has not been discredited. The explanation for delay in

 registration of the FIR appears to be natural and acceptable

 because the prosecutrix states that she disclosed the incident to

 her parents immediately upon their return to their village on

 13/01/2014. This version corroborated by the evidence of her

 father PW-8 wherein he also states that he along with his wife had

 gone out of the village on 09/01/2004 to attend the marriage and

 they came back on 13/01/2004. There was suggestion given to

 both these witnesses in cross-examination on behalf of the defence

 to indicate that the prosecutrix was having an illicit relationship

 with a third person and that since the appellant had refused the

 marriage proposal of the prosecutrix, he was falsely implicated.



</p><p id="p_13"> 10.              Insofar as the allegation of illicit relationship with a

 third person is concerned, other than giving mere suggestion on

 behalf of the defence, there is no material on record. As regards

 defence of false implication sought to be put forward and argued

 before this Court on behalf of the appellant, the contention seems

 to be that when the appellant and his family refused the marriage

 proposal that came from the prosecutrix and her family, the father

 of the prosecutrix i.e. complainant PW-8 lodged the false report

 with the Police Station on 14/01/2004.             There is no witness

 examined on behalf of the appellant from the village to support

 the said contention. It is difficult to believe that only because the

 marriage proposal of his daughter was refused by the appellant

 and his family, the complainant PW-8 lodged false complaint

 against the appellant. It is hard to believe that the prosecutrix

 PW-7 and her father complainant PW-8 would lodge a false report

 against the appellant only for the reason that he refused to marry

 her, when lodging such report and going through the process of

 trial in an allegation concerning rape, certainly exposed the

 prosecutrix and her family to embarrassment and ridicule in the

 society. This is relevant because the incident had taken place in a

 village where any young girl, who suffers such an experience is

 unfortunately marked out and becomes subject of discussion. The

 very fact that the prosecutrix and her family chose to come out in

 the open and make their grievance public by initiating the

 prosecution indicates that such an action would not have been

 taken for the mere reason of refusal of marriage proposal by the

 appellant. The evidence has to be analyzed in its context and,

 therefore, even if the evidence of the prosecutrix PW-7 and her

 father complainant PW-8 appears to be the sheet anchor of the

 prosecution case, as long as the evidence of these two witnesses

 had remained steadfast in cross-examination, no fault can be

 found with the impugned judgment and order convicting and

 sentencing the appellant on the basis of the said evidence.

 evidence of the prosecutrix PW-7 and the complainant PW-8

 clearly indicates the role of the appellant in the incident that

 occurred on 09/01/2004. The delay in registration of the FIR, in

 the facts and circumstances of the present case was satisfactorily

 explained and delay in registration of F.I.R. cannot be of any

 benefit for the appellant.

 order dated 11/08/2005, he shall be now taken into custody for
