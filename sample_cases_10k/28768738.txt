     THIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR
     ADMISSION ON 16.10.2018, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY
     PASSED THE FOLLOWING:
 Crl.MC.No. 6899 of 2018
                                      2


                          O R D E R
</pre>


<p id="p_1">    The        petitioner     herein,         who     is     the

respondent in the MC proceedings objected to

the territorial jurisdiction of the court on

the ground that the aggrieved person was not

residing       in   the     address       shown       in     the

petition.       She produced a bill issued by the

water authority specifying the house number,

which    was    accepted     by   the     court      below    as

correct.        That order is under challenge in

this proceeding.
</p>
<p id="p_2">    2.     It seems that in the objection the

petitioner herein did not raise any objection

specifically         regarding          the         lack     of

territorial jurisdiction of the court below.

It seems that only at the time of trial, a

case was developed that she was not residing

in that address.           She was cross examined on

that,    wherein     she     asserted      that      she     was

residing       in   the     building      shown       in     the
 Crl.MC.No. 6899 of 2018
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                          3</span>

petition.    She was called upon to produce the

proof of residence of the aggrieved person.

She     produced     the        water         authority        bill

specifying the house number.                     After the court

has    accepted    it     as     sufficient,          still     not

satisfied     with      that,       the          petitioner    has

challenged it.
</p>
<p id="p_3">       Being a summary proceeding, I do not feel

that this is a matter in which the question

of jurisdiction, can be prolonged like this.

Hence I find no merits in the challenge made

against the order in CMP.No.1330 of 2018 in

MC.No.20/2017        of        Judicial            First      Class

Magistrate Court, Kakkanad. Crl.M.C fails and

is dismissed.
