<p id="p_21">                               JUDICIAL RESOLUTION


</p><p id="p_22">8.           It is settled proposition of criminal law that prosecution is supposed to
prove its case on the judicial file by leading cogent, convincing reliable and
trustworthy evidence beyond reasonable doubt. The case of prosecution has to fall
or stand on its own legs and it cannot derive any benefit from the weakness if any,
in the defence of the accused. It is not for the accused to disprove the case of the
prosecution and onus to prove the case against the accused beyond reasonable
doubt never shifts and it always remains on the prosecution. Further, benefit of
doubt in the prosecution story always goes to the accused and it entitles the
accused to acquittal.
</p><p id="p_23">It has been held in case of Sadhu Singh V/s State of Punjab 1997(3) Crime 55
the Hon'ble Punjab &amp; Haryana High Court :-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">                          "In a criminal trial, it is for the prosecution to establish its case
                          beyond all reasonable doubts. It is for the prosecution to travel the
                          entire distance from may have to must have. If the prosecution
                          appears to be improbable or lacks credibility the benefit of doubt
                          necessarily has to go to the accused."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_24">9. No Public witness joined during investigation/recovery:
From careful perusal of testimonies of prosecution witnesses, it is apparent that
the spot was populated area and public persons were available at the time of
recovery and arrest, but no public person has been made a witness in the present


FIR No. 93/07    Under Section 25 Arms Act        State Vs. Boby @ Ashu        Page 5/12
 case and it is a serious lapse on the part of IO/Investigating Agency.
9.1. In the present case, the Investigating Officer has not joined any independent
public witness despite availability.     Admittedly, several public witnesses were
present at the time of alleged recovery of knife and apprehension of accused (as
admitted by recovery witnesses PW-2, PW-3 and PW-5 in their testimony).
9.2. Merely stating that they tried to join public witness, but public persons refused
to join, is insufficient as they have not obtained even the names of such public
persons and have also failed to explain as to why the provisions of <a href="/doc/456664/" id="a_16">section 174</a>
IPC r/w <a href="/doc/631265/" id="a_17">Section 42</a> of the Cr. P.C. was not brought into action against such public
persons.
</p><p id="p_25">In the state of Rajasthan Vs. Teja Singh 2001 (II) AD (SC) 125, Hon'ble
Supreme Court held:
</p><p id="p_26">                     "The failure of the prosecution to examine independent      witnesses
                     though available is fatal for their case."
</p><p id="p_27">In the case titled State of Punjab Vs. Gurdyal Singh 1992(1) RCR (DB) 646,
Roop Chand Vs. State of Haryana 1989 (2) RCR 504 and State of Punjab Vs.
Sukhdev Singh 1992 (3) RCR 311, it was held by the Hon'ble Court that :-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">                     "Where the IO has failed to even note down the names and addresses
                     of the persons, who have refused to join a public witnesses, couple
                     with the fact that no action was taken against them, the case is
                     rendered doubtful."
</blockquote><p id="p_28">9.3. The Court would also like to refer to the judgment titled Ritesh Chakarvarti
Vs. State of Madhya Pradesh, (SC) 2006 (4) R.C.R (Criminal) 480 the division
bench of Honorable Justices Sh. S. B. Sinha and Sh. Dalveer Bhandari Observed:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">                     "If it was a busy place, the officers would expectedly ask those to be
                     witnesses to the seizure memo who were present at the time in the
                     place of occurrence. But, not only no such attempt was made, even
                     nobody else who had witnessed the occurrence was made a
                     witnesses. Even their names and addresses had not been taken.

9.4. In the case titled as Nanak Chand Vs. State of Delhi, 1992(1) R.C.R. (Cr.)

                    in every case the police officials are to be treated as unworthy of
                    reliance but their failure to join witness from the public specially when
                    they are available, may, as in the present case creates doubt. They
                    have again, churned out a stereo typed version."
</blockquote><p id="p_29">9.5. Hon'ble High Court of Delhi in Anoop Joshi V/s State 1999(2) C.C. Cases
314 (HC), observed as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_12">                    "18. It is repeatedly laid down by this court that in such cases it should be
                    shown by the police that sincere efforts have been made to join
                    independent witnesses. In the present case, it is evident that no such
                    sincere efforts have been made, particularly when we find that shops were
                    open and one or two shopkeepers could have been persuaded to join the
                    raiding party to witness the recovery being made from the appellant. In
                    case any of the shopkeepers had declined to join the raiding party, the
                    police could have later on taken legal action against such shopkeepers
                    because they could not have escaped the rigours of law while declining to
                    perform their legal duty to assist the police in investigation as a citizen,
                    which is an offence under the <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_19">IPC</a>".

                    evidence of police officers only unless it is supported by some
                    corroborative evidence or unless circumstances of the case sufficiently
                    lend assurance to the court that all that is being stated by the police
                    officers is correct. Normally speaking when a raid of this kind is arranged
                    one should expect the police officer to involve independent witnesses. In
                    this case the court is told that an effort was made but nobody came
                    forward. It has been my unfortunate experience that this explanation is now
                    being tendered in almost all cases. Normal rule is the involvement of public
                    witnesses and if that is not followed it must be sufficiently explained as to
                    why it was not so".
</blockquote><p id="p_31">9.7. In the present case, the recovery of knife is alleged to be made at 12:45
P.M, thus, the recovery has been made during day time and admittedly there
were people present near the spot, still, the police officials failed to find even
a single public witness who could have joined investigation. Moreover, no
efforts were made to join any resident of nearby Jhuggi as shown in the site
plan Ex.PW3/D. In absence of a public witness to the recovery and also in
absence of an explanation as to why a public person was not joined in the

FIR No. 93/07   Under Section 25 Arms Act         State Vs. Boby @ Ashu         Page 7/12
 investigation, the prosecution has failed to prove the recovery of the weapon
from the accused beyond reasonable doubt.
</p>

<p id="p_32">10. Seal not handed over to Public Person:
</p><p id="p_33">In the present case, seal of BS after use on the case property was given to
PW2 HC Deepak. In the opinion of the court, in such circumstances,
chances of fabrication with the case property cannot be ruled out in as much
as a material prosecution witness is always interested in the conviction of
the accused. Further, it is pertinent to note that no memo has been placed
on record showing the date and time when the seal was returned to PW3
ASI Bhuri Singh by PW2 HC Deepak. PW-2 and PW3 are silent in this
regard, rather, it has not been stated by any of these witnesses that when
the said seal was returned to ASI Bhuri Singh and in absence of such
testimony it is possible that the seal was returned back in an hour or so or
before the case property was deposited with MHC(M). Thus, tampering with
the case property can not be ruled out.
</p><p id="p_34">10.1. Also in this case no efforts were made to hand over the seal after use
to any independent public person and in such cases, in view of Saifulla Vs.
State 1998(1) CCC 497 (DELHI) &amp; Abdul Gaffar Vs. State 1996 JCC 497
(DELHI), benefit of doubt must be given to the accused persons.
10.2. Reliance in this regard is also placed on the judgments titled Ramji
Singh V/s State of Haryana 2007 (3) R.C.R. (Criminal) 452; Rajesh
Jagdamba Avasthi Vs. State of Goa, (2005)9 SCC 773 and <a href="/doc/154754720/" id="a_22">Bijay vs.
State ( G.N.C.T. Of Delhi</a>), 2011 VI AD (DELHI)562.
</p>

<p id="p_35">11. FIR number mentioned on Seizure memo:
</p>

<p id="p_36">Further it is found that sketch of the knife as well as the seizure memo of the
same Ex.PW2/A and Ex.PW2/B respectively bear the number of FIR,


FIR No. 93/07   Under Section 25 Arms Act   State Vs. Boby @ Ashu   Page 8/12
 though, as per rukka, the said documents were prepared before registration
of FIR. However, the fact that said seizure memo Ex.PW2/B and sketch of
the knife Ex.PW2/A bear FIR number gives rise to two inferences that either
FIR was registered after the alleged recovery of knife or the number of the
FIR was inserted in the documents (seizure memo and sketch of knife) after
its registration. In both the situations, it seriously reflects on the veracity of
the prosecution case and robs the efficacy of the evidence of the aforesaid
police official regarding the alleged recovery of knife from the possession of
the accused. Reliance is placed upon judgment titled "Prithvi Pal Singh @
Munna Vs. State 2000 II AD (Cr.) DHC 61".
</p>

<p id="p_37">11.1. In another case titled as Mohd. Hasim Vs. State, 1999 VI AD (DELHI)
569 Honorable Delhi High Court in this regard observed as under:
</p><p id="p_38">                      " Documents prepared before registering the FIR bears
FIR Number, meaning thereby either FIR was recorded posterior in time or
that documents were prepared after the recording the FIR, and was held
that in both case, prosecution case would collapse."
   Thus, this anomaly of noting of FIR Number in the seizure memo, which
admittedly as per prosecution case, has been prepared prior to registration
of FIR raises a grave doubt on the veracity of the prosecution case as to the
apprehension of the accused with knife.
</p>

<p id="p_39">12. No Departure entry as regards patrolling
As per the Punjab Police Rules, an entry is required to be made as regards
the hour of arrival and departure of police personnel on duty.
Chapter 22 Rule 49 of Punjab Police Rules, 1934, provides as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_14">                   ''22.49 Matters to be entered in Register No. II.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_15">                   The following matters shall, amongst others, be entered :
                   ...........</blockquote>
<p id="p_40">                   (c) The hour of arrival and departure on duty at or from a police station of
                   all enrolled police officers of whatever rank, whether posted at the police
                   station or elsewhere, with a statement of the nature of their duty. This entry


FIR No. 93/07   Under Section 25 Arms Act        State Vs. Boby @ Ashu          Page 9/12
                    shall be made immediately on arrival or prior to the departure of the officer
                   concerned and shall be attested by the latter personally by signature or
                   seal.
</p><p id="p_41">                   Note :The term Police Station will include all places such as Police Lines
                   and Police Posts where Register No. II is maintained."
</p>
<p id="p_42">13.1. The above said provision prima facie, has not been complied with by
prosecution in the present case. As per the prosecution version at the time
of the apprehension of the accused with knife in his possession, PW5 Ct.
Jitender Singh was on patrolling duty near P.K. pulia, but the DD entry vide
which he had left the police station for patrolling has not been brought on
record. The prosecution was under an obligation to prove on record, the
above said DD entries vide which PW5 Ct. Jitender Singh had left the PS so
as to prove the possibility of availability of these three witnesses at the place
of apprehension of the accused. In this regard in Rattan Lal V/s State,
1987(2) Crimes 29, Hon'ble Delhi High Court has observed that if the
investigating agency deliberately ignores to comply with the provisions of
the Act, the courts will have to approach their action with reservations. The
matter has to be viewed with suspicion if the provisions of law are not strictly
complied with and the least that can be said is that it is so done with an
oblique motive. This failure to bring on record, the DD entries creates a
reasonable doubt in the prosecution version and attributes oblique motive
on the part of the prosecution.
</p><p id="p_43">14. Before recovery no personal search offered:
</p><p id="p_44">In the present case, recovery witness PW5 Ct. Jitender Singh nowhere
deposed that he had offered his personal search to the accused prior to
taking the search of the accused. Hon'ble Orissa High Court in judgment
under the <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_23">Prevention of Corruption Act</a> titled Rabindernath Prusty Vs.
State of Orissa 1984 Cr.L.J 1392, held as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_16">                   "10. The next part of the prosecution case is relating to the search and
                   recovery of Rs. 500/- from the accused. One of the formalities that has to
                   be observed in searching a person in that the searching Officer and other
                   assisting him should give their personal search to the accused before
                   searching the person of the accused. (See AIR 1969 SC 53 : 1969 Cri L.J.</blockquote>
<p id="p_45">                   279, State of Bihar V/s Kapil Singh). This rule is meant to avoid the

FIR No. 93/07   Under Section 25 Arms Act        State Vs. Boby @ Ashu         Page 10/12
                    possibility of implanting the object which was brought out by the search.
                   There is no evidence on record whatsoever that the raiding party gave their
                   personal search to the accused before the latter's person was searched.
                   Besides the above, it is in the evidence of PWs 2 and 5 that the accused
                   wanted to know the reason for which his person was to be searched and
                   the reason for such search was not intimated to the accused. No
                   independent witness had witnessed the search. In the above premises, my
                   conclusion is that the search was illegal and consequently the conviction
                   based thereon is also vitiated"
</p><p id="p_46">15.1 In State of Bihar V/s Kapil Singh 1969 Cri L.J. 279 while deciding a
murder case, Hon'ble Apex Court observed in para 10 as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_17">                   "......The circumstances of the recovery are also doubtful. According to
                   Inspector of Police, Pathak, he observed all the formalities required to be
                   observed when searching the house of Deo Singh. One of the formalities
                   that has to be observed is that the searching officer should give his
                   personal search to the witnesses before entering the premises to be
                   searched and should similarly search the witnesses also in the presence of
                   one another......"
</blockquote><p id="p_47">15.2 In the light of the aforesaid case law, it can be said that search of the
accused by above said police officials was in complete violation of the law
laid down by superior courts in this regard.
</p><p id="p_48">                                     Conclusion


</p><p id="p_49">16.    In view of my above discussion, I am of the considered opinion that
prosecution has failed to prove its case against the accused beyond
reasonable doubt. There are several loop holes in the prosecution story
which give rise to doubt in the mind of the court as regards the alleged
recovery and inclines the court to give benefit of doubt to accused. In the
case of <a href="/doc/720083/" id="a_24">State of Haryana v. Bhagirath</a>, AIR 1999 SC 2005, the Hon'ble
Supreme Court illustrated the doctrine of benefit of doubt in the following
words -
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_18">                   "The pristine doctrine of benefit of doubt can be invoked when there is
                   reasonable doubt regarding the guilt of the accused. It is the reasonable
                   doubt which a conscientious judicial mind entertains on a conspectus of
                   the entire evidence that the accused might not have committed the
                   offence, which affords benefit to the accused at the end of the criminal trial.
                   Benefit of doubt is not a legal dosage to be administered at every segment
                   of the evidence, but an advantage to be afforded to the accused at the final
                   end after consideration of the entire evidence, if the judge conscientiously
                   and reasonably entertains doubt regarding the guilt of the accused."
