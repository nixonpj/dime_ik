                      -----------
C.A.V. ON: 08/10/2015      PRONOUNCED ON-05/01/2016

            Invoking the inherent jurisdiction of this Court under
<a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_1">Section 482</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure (in short 'the Code'),
the sole petitioner has prayed for quashing of the entire criminal
proceeding relating to Manoharpur P.S. Case No. 31 of 1996
corresponding to G.R. case No. 202 of 1996, pending in the court of
Judicial Magistrate, 1st Class, Porahat at Chaibasa.
2.          The facts of the case, which is relevant for the proper
appreciation of the issue involved in this case, in short, is that at the
instance of the informant-the Circle Officer, Manoharpur, West
Singhbhum, the aforesaid case was instituted on 27.07.1996 under
<a href="/doc/1985627/" id="a_2">Sections 467</a>, <a href="/doc/556166/" id="a_3">468</a>, <a href="/doc/1466184/" id="a_4">471</a>, <a href="/doc/1436241/" id="a_5">420</a>/<a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_6">34</a>, <a href="/doc/513074/" id="a_7">109</a> and <a href="/doc/1128948/" id="a_8">120(B)</a> of Indian Penal Code
on the allegation that after receiving an allegation petition, the
Deputy Commissioner, Singhbhum directed the District Welfare
Officer, West Singhbhum at Chaibasa to make an enquiry in respect
of the allegations made by one Dr. Rajendra Prasad Singh in his letter
dated 04.02.1992 and on the basis of the report submitted by the
District Welfare Officer after enquiry, it was transpired that St.
Augustin College, Manoharpur had received fund from Government
in respect of tuition fee, examination fee and other fess for Scheduled
Caste and Scheduled Tribe students and for the same period, the
                             2


authority also received grant from Welfare Department in respect of
tuition fees payable to the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe
students. Thus, double funds were received by the College. By letter
dated 26.08.1994, the said Enquiry Officer directed the Principal of
the college to refund the tuition fees realized from Scheduled Caste
and Scheduled Tribe students within a month and the balance
amount, which could be refunded to those students, should be
deposited/returned to Welfare Department. After the said direction,
the Principal of the college issued notice to the Scheduled Caste and
Scheduled Tribe students to receive the amount of the period
06.06.1994</pre><p id="p_1"> to 30.06.1994. It is alleged that the Principal had received
those amounts from two different sources in violation of the rules,
which is a serious offence and the college maintained 2-3 types of
account books for the said purpose and without the approval of the
state government, the Principal of the said college by cheating
received Rs.1,37,840/-. The Enquiry Officer found the involvement of
this petitioner, who was the Principal during the relevant period, and
the involvement of five other persons namely Sunita Topno- the
Acting Principal, Dr. Anuj Kumar Dhan-the Principal from 1987 to
1992, John Bhuiyan- Acting Principal, Mojesh Sukumar Das- the
Cashier and Walter Bara- another Cashier besides the members of
Governing Body in the alleged offence and responsible for the
misappropriation and defalcation of the amount. In the F.I.R., several
documents were annexed showing allegation of cheating and
misappropriation of money.
</p><p id="p_2">3.         It appears from the record that after investigation, the
police submitted the charge sheet against this petitioner and other
accused persons, thereafter, the court took cognizance of the offence.
At the stage of framing of charge, petitions under <a href="/doc/1572967/" id="a_9">Section 239</a> of the
Code were filed by the accused persons for their discharge but the
court below finding prima facie case and grave suspicion rejected
their prayer for discharge. It further appears that this petitioner had
earlier filed one W.P.(Cr.) no. 44 of 2005 against the order 04.01.2005
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                             3</span>


by which the court below refused to discharge the petitioner and the
said W.P.(Cr.) was disposed of by this Court vide order dated
17.02.2005 with direction to the court concerned to supply the copy of
police paper and other documents and thereafter proceed for framing
of the charge in accordance with law. The petitioner and other
accused persons again filed petitions under <a href="/doc/1572967/" id="a_10">Section 239</a> of the Code in
the court below praying therein that though the photo stat copy of
the case diary has been supplied to the petitioner showing it as a
police paper but copies of documents received from District Welfare
Officer, Chaibasa has not been furnished and prayed for their
discharge. The court below after hearing the parties passed a
common order dated 27.06.2005 rejecting the petitions filed for their
discharge under <a href="/doc/1572967/" id="a_11">Section 239</a> of the Code and directed the petitioner
and other accused persons to be physically present before the court
for framing of charge.
</p><p id="p_3">4.          Mr. Gadodia learned counsel appearing for the petitioner
assailing the order impugned refusing to discharge the petitioner as
bad in law and perverse seriously contended that even after direction
given by this Court, the papers submitted by the District Welfare
Officer enclosing some documents have not been supplied to the
petitioner except the copy of the case diary. It was also submitted that
the entire allegation in the first information report is vague and no
individual liability has been assigned or discussed either in the first
information report or in the order passed on the petition filed under
<a href="/doc/1572967/" id="a_12">Section 239</a> of the Code and there is no discussion regarding any
criminality or any criminal act on the part of the petitioner and even
the court below has not considered the evidence available on record
in right perspective. Learned counsel further relying upon the cases
Ram Kishan Singh Vs. Harmit Kaur and another; (1072) 3 SCC 282
and Kamal Kant Singh @ K.K.Sinha &amp; Ors. Vs. State of Jharkhand;
2008(1) JCR 74 (Jhr.) submitted that there is no prima facie case or
sufficient material on record to frame charge against the petitioner
and when the charges are found groundless on the face of the record,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                              4</span>


the accused petitioner is entitled to an order of discharge. It was also
submitted that from the F.I.R. itself, it would appear that a direction
was given by the District Welfare Officer to return the amount and,
accordingly, the amount as alleged was returned, as such no case is
made out against this petitioner.
</p><p id="p_4">5.          Contrary to the aforesaid submissions, the learned
counsel representing the State seriously contended that the prayer of
the petitioner in this criminal miscellaneous petition is confined to
the quashing of the entire criminal proceeding but the learned
counsel for the petitioner has mainly relied on the order dated
27.06.2005 passed by the court below by which the petition for
discharge of the petitioner and other accused persons was rejected. It
was also submitted that the court below in the said order has
meticulously considered the materials available on record and at this
early stage, a roving enquiry into the pros and cons of the matter is
not permissible. It was also submitted that all the papers, which were
part of the case diary, were given to the petitioner and only those
documents, which were submitted in court, along with letter of
District Welfare Officer, had not been given to the petitioner because
they were all subject to inspection under the law.
</p><p id="p_5">6.          Before adverting to the rival submissions, it would be
proper to examine the scope and ambit of the power of the court
below under <a href="/doc/1572967/" id="a_13">Section 239</a> of the Code. The<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_14"> Criminal Procedure Code</a>
contemplates the discharge of an accused if the case is triable by a
Court of Sessions under <a href="/doc/470297/" id="a_15">Section 227</a> of the Code but if the case is
instituted upon a police report and is triable by a Magistrate then it is
covered by <a href="/doc/1572967/" id="a_16">Section 239</a> of the Code. There is basically no difference in
a discharge petition filed either under <a href="/doc/470297/" id="a_17">Section 227</a> or 239<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_18"> of the Code</a>.
The above two provisions<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_19"> of the Code</a> provide that upon
consideration of the evidence and the documents submitted with the
police report as contemplated under <a href="/doc/1187622/" id="a_20">Section 173</a> of the Code and after
hearing the prosecution and the accused, if the Court finds a prima
facie case and grave suspicion to proceed against the accused, the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                              5</span>


charge has to be framed but if there is no prima facie case, or
suspicion, the Court shall discharge the accused. The settled law at
this point is succinctly analyzed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in
Sajjan Kumar Vs. CBI [(2010) 9 SCC 368 ] wherein the Hon'ble Court
has observed in para 19 as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">         " 19.     It is clear that at the initial stage, if there is
         strong suspicion which leads the Court to think that
         there is ground for presuming that the accused has
         committed an offence, then it is not open to the Court to
         say that there is no sufficient ground for proceeding
         against the accused. The presumption of the guilt of the
         accused which is to be drawn at the initial stage is only
         for the purpose of deciding prima facie whether the Court
         should proceed with the trial or not. If the evidence which
         the prosecution proposes to adduce proves the guilt of the
         accused even if fully accepted before it is challenged in
         cross-examination or rebutted by the defence evidence, if
         any, cannot show that the accused committed the offence,
         then there will be no sufficient ground for proceeding
         with the trial."
</blockquote><p id="p_6">7.           True, it is that at the time of consideration of the
application for discharge, the court cannot act as mouthpiece of the
prosecution or act as a post-office and may sift evidence in order to
find out whether or not the allegations made are groundless so as to
pass the order of discharge. It is trite that at the stage of consideration
of an application for discharge, a roving enquiry into the pros and
cons of the matter and weigh the evidence as if the Court was
conducting a trial, is not permissible.
</p><p id="p_7">8.          In another case Rajiv Thapar and others Vs. Madan Lal
Kapoor; (2013) 3 SCC 330, the Hon'ble Supreme Court while dealing
with the issue of discharge in a complaint case, lodged at the instance
of father of a deceased girl, held in paragraph- 28 that this is not a
stage of evaluating the truthfulness or otherwise of the allegations
levelled by the prosecution/complainant against the accused. Even if
the accused is successful in showing some suspicion or doubt, in the
allegations levelled by the prosecution, it would be impermissible to
discharge the accused before trial. This is so because it would result
in giving finality to the accusations levelled by the prosecution,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                6</span>


without allowing the prosecution to adduce evidence to substantiate
the same.
</p><p id="p_8">9.            Apparently, the petitioner has prayed for quashing of the
entire criminal proceeding only and there is no prayer to quash the
order of the court below by which the petition filed for his discharge
under <a href="/doc/1572967/" id="a_21">Section 239</a> of the Code was rejected. However, in the interest
of justice, I have critically examined all the materials, evidences and
the order dated 27.06.2005 passed by the court below and I find that
on the relevant date, this petitioner was the Principal of the said
college and there are sufficient evidence on record to show that there
was misappropriation and defalcation of government fund and on
perusal of paragraph 117 of the case diary, it would appear that this
petitioner has himself accepted that from 1982 onwards, he had
received fund from two different sources without approval of the
government and the amounts, which were collected illegally from the
Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe students, were returned to
those students after giving them notices. It appears from the order
impugned dated 27.06.2005 that the court below has considered the
evidence available on record and found prima facie case and
sufficient materials against this petitioner and other accused persons
to proceed and frame charge against them.
</p><p id="p_9">10.           In view of the discussions made above, I do not find any
plausible ground to interfere in the criminal proceeding pending in
the court of Judicial Magistrate, 1st Class, Porahat at Chaibasa in
connection with Manoharpur P.S. Case no. 31 of 1996 and also in the
order dated 27.06.2005 passed on the petition filed under <a href="/doc/1572967/" id="a_22">Section 239</a>
of the Code. Hence, this criminal miscellaneous petition, being
devoid of any merit is, hereby, dismissed.
