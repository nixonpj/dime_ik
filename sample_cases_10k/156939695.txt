</p><p id="p_4"> 3.           Aggrieving of said impugned order dated 01.10.2018, present

appeal has been filed by the appellant.
</p>
<p id="p_5">4.           Notice of the present criminal appeal was issued to the

respondent, who appeared in the court and filed reply to the present

criminal appeal. Trial Court Record was also summoned.

</p><p id="p_6">5.           Ld. counsel for the appellant submitted that impugned order

passed by ld. trial court is erroneous, without considering the facts and

circumstances of the case further submitting that marriage between the

parties concerned stood dissolved by way of talaq and also that parties

concerned were residing at different place than to appellant. Ld. counsel

further submitted that validity of the talaq was not challenged by the

respondent herein and that ld. trial court misinterpreted the issue and

passed illegal order. Ld. counsel for the appellant thus, prayed for setting

aside the impugned order passed by ld. trial court qua appellant herein.

Cases       reported       as   Harbans      Lal     Malik        Vs.    Payal       Malik,

Maharashtra &amp; Ors, MANU/MH/2780/2018                   were relied upon by ld.

counsel for the appellant in support of his contentions.

</p><p id="p_7">6.           On the other hand, ld. counsel for the respondent/complainant

submitted that she got married with son of the appellant on 30.03.2012 and

one male child out of said wedlock is also born out. He further submitted

that the only issue in question is that whether appellant and respondent

herein have any domestic relationship as per the Act or not. Ld. counsel

further submitted that filing of the present criminal appeal is only delay

tactics and prayed for dismissal of the same with costs. Ld. counsel for the

respondent has placed reliance on the cases reported as Afzalummisa

Begum &amp; etc. Vs. State of A.P. &amp; Anr., 2009 Crl. L.J 4191; Krishna

Bhatacharjee Vs. Sarathi Choudhury &amp; Anr. 2016 (1) JCC 31 and

</p>
<p id="p_9">8.           Marriage between the parties concerned on the date mentioned

therein the petition and birth of a son out of said wedlock are not denied by

parties. Appellant took the plea that now the said marriage stood dissolved

by way of talaq and said fact is denied by respondent herein. The another



Crl. Appeal No. 154/2018     Khadija Sarwat Vs. Sana Hashmi       Page No. 4 of 7
 plea taken by the appellant is that she has no domestic relations with

respondent herein as appellant and respondent herein were residing at

different places and even marriage has been dissolved.

</p><p id="p_10">9.           Perusal of the Protection of Women from <a href="/doc/542601/" id="a_4">Domestic Violence Act</a>,

2005 is clear that "domestic relationship" has been defined under Sec. 2 (f)

of the of said Act. To facilitate the matter, said definition is reproduced as

under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">                "domestic relationship" means a relationship

              between two persons who live or have, at any point

              of time, lived together in a shared household,

              when they related by consanguinity, marriage or

              through a relationship in the nature of marriage,

              adoption or are family members living together as a

              joint family.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_11">10.          Perusal of the above definition is clear to the affect that

"relationship between two persons who live or have, at any point of time,

lived together in a shared household, when they related by consanguinity,

marriage or through a relationship in the nature of marriage" would come

under the domestic relationship. It is undisputed fact that after the

marriage, respondent no. 2 joined the matrimonial home with appellant

herein.
</p>
<p id="p_12">

Crl. Appeal No. 154/2018      Khadija Sarwat Vs. Sana Hashmi    Page No. 5 of 7
</p><p id="p_13"> 11.             I have also perused the impugned order. Said order is detailed

and well reasoned. Ld. trial court after discussing the each and every point

in detail with the help of the definitions and passed the impugned order.

Case is at the initial stage and parties have to lead their respective

evidence.
</p>
<p id="p_14">12.             Though not important but relevant to mention here that

respondent no. 3 &amp; 4 of the main petition filed by the petitioner/respondent

herein have already been discharged by the ld. trial court vide the said

impugned order and that no appeal has been filed by the respondent no. 1

(in the main petition)/husband of the respondent herein against the

impugned order.
</p>
<p id="p_15">13.             Cases relied upon by ld. counsel for the appellant are on

different ground and are not applicable to the present case. It is to be kept

in mind that each case has its own peculiar facts and circumstances.

</p><p id="p_16">14.             With these observations, this court is also concur with the

order passed by the ld. trial court and of the view that there is no illegality,

perversity or error in the impugned order and same does not deserves any

interference.
