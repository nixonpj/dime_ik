                                 ORDER
</pre><p id="p_1">                                  (ORAL)
</p><p id="p_2">1.    In the first round of litigation, respondent-college was directed to
consider   petitioners'   representations   and   to   convey   the   fate   of
representations to petitioners, which has not been done. Learned counsel for
respondent-college submits that in the minutes of the meeting of the
governing body of respondent-college held on 8th March, 2018, the
representations of petitioners have been decided and its fate would be
shortly conveyed to petitioners.    However, it is pointed out by learned
counsel for respondent-college that the approval to petitioners' appointment
on regular basis has been already sought from the respondent-University but
W.P.(C) No.3303/2018                                                    Page 1
 it has not been yet granted. To submit so, attention of this Court is drawn to
minutes of the emergency meeting of the governing body of the respondent-
college of 23rd January, 2018 (Annexure-B colly.). It is also brought to the
notice of this Court that since the selection process to appoint petitioners
could not be completed within a period of 18 months, therefore the
respondent-University Grants Commission (hereinafter referred to as UGC)
and the Comptroller and Auditor General of India are not granting approval
to release of funds for paying the salary to petitioners. To submit so,
attention of this Court is drawn to the communication of 28 th February, 2018
vide which petitioners have been informed by the respondent-college about
it.
</p><p id="p_3">2.    Upon hearing, it becomes evident from the minutes of the emergency
meeting of the governing body of the respondent-college (Annexure-B
colly.) that respondent-college had received sanction of post in question
from respondent-UGC vide letter of 21st June, 2017 and had sought approval
of the Roaster from respondent-University. In the facts and circumstances
of this case, it is deemed appropriate to dispose of this petition and the
applications with direction to respondent-University to ensure that the post-
facto approval of petitioners' appointment forwarded by the respondent-
college to university, is promptly sent to respondent-UGC, if not already
done. Let respondent-University Grants Commission consider granting of
the approval to petitioners' appointment within a period of four weeks and if
it is not done, then the reasons for not doing so, be spelt out and petitioners
be intimated about it within a week thereafter, so that petitioners may avail
of the remedies as available in law, if need be.
