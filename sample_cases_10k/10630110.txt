</pre>

<p id="p_1">                BRIEF REASONS FOR SUCH DECISION

</p><p id="p_2">1.           Brief facts of case as per version of the prosecution are that
on 03.09.2003 at about 07:30 p.m. at Bhagat Singh Park, opposite
DTC bus depot Yamuna Vihar, Delhi, the accused was found in
possession of one country made pistol of 32 bore and one live
cartridge, without any valid license or permit in contravention of
notification of the Competent Authority. Therefore, the present FIR
bearing No. 303/2003 dated 03.09.2003 under <a href="/doc/73862/" id="a_3">Section 25</a>/<a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_4">54</a>/<a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_5">59</a> of
Arms Act was registered against the accused at P.S. Bhajanpura,
Delhi.
</p>
<p id="p_3">2.           After completion of investigation, charge sheet was filed
against the accused under Section 25/54/59 of the Arms Act on
04.03.2004 and on same date, cognizance of offence was taken by Ld.
Predecessor of this Court and copy of charge sheet was supplied to the
accused in compliance of Section 207 Cr.P.C.
</p>
<p id="p_4">3.           Thereafter, vide order dated 24.01.2005, charge for
committing offence punishable u/s 25/54/59 of the <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_6">Arms Act</a> was
framed against the accused, to which, he pleaded not guilty and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">FIR No. 303/2003                                                    Page 2 of 8</span>
State Vs. Shahe Alam @ Allah Rakha                            Dated: 27.06.2019
 claimed trial.
</p>


<p id="p_5">4.           In order to prove its case, the prosecution has examined 7
witnesses and thereafter statement of accused u/s 313 read with
<a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_7">Section 281</a> Cr. P. C. was also recorded on 13.03.2019 wherein
accused refuted the allegation of the prosecution and claimed himself
innocent and also raised plea of false implication. Thereafter, Ld. APP
for the State and Ld. Defence counsel had made detail oral
submissions on behalf of respective parties.
</p>

<p id="p_6">5.           PW­1 Ct. Satya Prakash stated that on 03.09.2003 he
alongwith Ct. Prem Chand and SI Narender were conducting
investigation of another case bearing FIR No. 296/03 U/s 393/397 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_8">IPC</a>
of PS Bhajanpura, Delhi and accused of that case pointed out that
accused Shahe Alam, who was standing in the park. PW­1 further
stated that on seeing them, accused Shahe Alam started running and he
was over powered after being chased by the said police officials. PW­1
also stated that from search of accused Shahe Alam, one country made
katta was recovered from left side dub from his paint and katta was
loaded with one live cartridge. PW­2 HC Yashvir Singh deposed about
receiving of rukka and registration of FIR in this case. PW­3 Ct. Prem
Chand supported the line of story of the prosecution as reflected in the
testimony of PW­1 Ct. Satya Prakash. PW­4 SI Narender Pal also

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">FIR No. 303/2003                                                 Page 3 of 8</span>
State Vs. Shahe Alam @ Allah Rakha                         Dated: 27.06.2019
 deposed about receiving of information from Jame Alam, accused of
another case bearing FIR No. 296/03 about the presence of accused of
this case namely Shahe Alam at Bhagat Singh Park, Yamuna Park and
on formal search of accused Shahe Alam one country made pistol
loaded with one live cartridge was recovered from his left dub of
paint. PW­4 also claimed that he had requested 3­4 persons who were
moving in the park to join the investigation but none has agreed and
left the place without disclosing their names and addresses. PW­4
further deposed about his role as IO in course of investigation in this
case. PW­5 HC Ramu stated that on 15.10.2003, MHC(M) Vijay
Singh had handed over one sealed pullanda with seal of NP to him
vide RC No. 95/21 for deposing the same at CFSL, Hyderabad and he
had deposed sealed pullanda at CFSL, Hyderabad against receipt. PW­
6 ASI Rishi Pal Singh deposed about his role as second IO in course of
investigation of the case. During cross examination, PW­6 admitted
that there was no gate in the room in the park and given park is a very
big park having residential area on its two sides. PW­6 further
admitted that the public persons are residing in said residential area
and they were roaming in the area of park at that time. PW­6 also
accepted that he did not obtain any finger print of accused from
country made pistol. It was suggested by the defence to PW­6 that no
recovery of any pistol was recovered from the accused and he has been
falsely implicated in this case after lifting from his factory. PW­7 Sh.

<p id="p_7">State Vs. Shahe Alam @ Allah Rakha                         Dated: 27.06.2019
 Anurag Kumar, the then Additional Deputy Commissioner of Police of
North­East, Delhi deposed about according sanction u/s 39 of <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_9">Arms
Act</a> against accused in this case.
</p>
<p id="p_8">6.           I have considered arguments advanced by Ld. APP for State
and Ld. Counsel for accused and have perused the entire material
available on record carefully.
</p>
<p id="p_9">7.           It is contended by Ld. Counsel for accused that nothing has
been recovered from possession of the accused and he is innocent and
has been falsely implicated in this case after planting case property,
which is easily available for police. It is further contended that all
prosecution witnesses are police witnesses and no independent public
witness has joined and all writing work was done in the police station.
It is further contended that the prosecution has failed to prove its case
beyond reasonable doubts and hence, the accused is entitled to be
acquitted. On other hand, Ld. APP for State contended that accused
has been found with illegal arm by the police official on pointing out
by another accused of another case in course of investigation of that
case and the testimony of police officials also supports the case of
prosecution.
</p>
<p id="p_10">8.           As per case of prosecution, police officials had recovered
country made pistol and live cartridge and no independent public
person has joined as witness in the present matter despite the place of

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">FIR No. 303/2003                                                  Page 5 of 8</span>
State Vs. Shahe Alam @ Allah Rakha                          Dated: 27.06.2019
 recovery being a big public park in a densely populated area and
public persons were roaming around the park as also admitted by PW­
6 during his cross examination. As per deposition of PW­4               had
allegedly asked 3­4 public persons to join the investigation but none
agreed and went away without telling their names and addresses.
However, it is noticeable that no written notice was served to those
persons who refused to join the investigation and their names and
addresses were also not even noted down. From the testimony of PW­
4 and PW­6, it is clear that there were availability of public persons at
the spot, but despite that no public witness has joined in the present
matter. No sincere efforts have been done to join the public witnesses
as no written notice was served to those public persons who had
allegedly refused to join the investigation.     Non­joining of public
witness raises a doubt in the story of the prosecution which is total
based on the oral testimony of police officials who are naturally
entrusted in conviction of accused.
</p>
<p id="p_11">9.           In a case law reported as "Roop Chand Vs. The State of
Haryana" 1999(1) C.L.R. 69, the Punjab &amp; Haryana High Court held
as under :­

             "3. I have heard the learned counsel for the
             parties and gone through the evidence with their
             help. The recovery of illicit liquor was effected
             from the possession of the petitioner during noon
             time and it is in the evidence of the prosecution
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">FIR No. 303/2003                                                  Page 6 of 8</span>
State Vs. Shahe Alam @ Allah Rakha                          Dated: 27.06.2019
              witnesses that some witnesses from the public were
             available and they were asked to join the
             investigation. The explanation furnished by the
             prosecution is that the independent witnesses were
             asked to join the investigation but they refused to
             do so on the ground that their joining will result
             into enmity between them and the petitioner".
</p>
<p id="p_12">             "4. It is well settled principle of the law that the
             investigating agency should join independent
             witnesses at the time of recovery of contraband
             articles, If they are available and their failure to
             do so in such a situation casts a shadow of doubt
             on the prosecution case. In the present case also
             admittedly the independent witnesses were
             available at the time of recovery but they refused
             to associate themselves in the investigation. This
             explanation does not inspire confidence because
             the police officials who are the only witnesses
             examined in the case have not given the names and
             addresses of the persons contacted to join it is a
             very common excuse that the witnesses from the
             public refused to join the investigation. A police
             officer conducting investigation of a crime is
             entitled to ask anybody to join the investigation
             and on refusal by a person from the public the
             Investigating Officer can take action against such
             a person under the law. Had it been a fact that the
             witnesses from the public had refused to join the
             investigation, the Investigating Officer must have
             proceeded against them under the relevant
             provisions of law. The failure to do so by the
             police officer is suggestive of the fact that the
             explanation for non­joining the witnesses from the
             public is an after thought and is not worth of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">FIR No. 303/2003                                                   Page 7 of 8</span>
State Vs. Shahe Alam @ Allah Rakha                           Dated: 27.06.2019
              credence. All these facts taken together make the
             prosecution case highly doubtful".
</p>

<p id="p_13">10.          It is not the case of prosecution that police official had
offered their search to the accused prior to taking the search of accused
himself. Further, no finger print of accused on alleged recovered arm
was taken by the police. These facts also raise doubt in the story of
prosecution.          For this, I rely on '<a href="/doc/1928699/" id="a_10">Pawan Kumar vs Delhi
Administration</a>, 1989 Cr.L.J. 1271'. In a case titled in AIR 1956 Cr.
L.J. 1234, it was held that,

                   "In the event of any doubt as to the guilt of
                   accused, the benefit will go to the accused".
</p>
<p id="p_14">11.          Taking into consideration all the facts and circumstances
and material available on record, I hold that the prosecution has failed
to prove its case against the accused beyond reasonable doubts.
Benefit of doubt is given to the accused. Hence, accused Shahe Alam
is acquitted from charge of offence punishable U/s 25 of <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_11">Arms Act</a>.
The case properties i.e. country made pistol and cartridges are
confiscated to the State.</p><pre id="pre_2">
