<div class="doc_title">Ganesh Pandit vs State Of Bihar on 3 July, 2008</div><pre id="pre_1">                   IN THE HIGH COURT OF JUDICATURE AT PATNA
                          Cr.Misc. No.17635 of 2008
                                GANESH PANDIT
                                    Versus
                                STATE OF BIHAR

<p id="p_1">3.   3.7.2008            Heard.
</p>
<p id="p_2">                         The prayer for bail of the petitioner

                was dismissed twice once in Cr.Misc.No.48699 of

                2006     and      on       the     other     occasion        in

                Cr.Misc.No.52820 of 2007. The order in the later

                miscellaneous petition was passed directing the

                petitioner to approach the lower court as the

                court wanted to know as to what developments had

                taken place      in investigation or          of the trial.

</p><p id="p_3">                         The    rejection        order     dated    19.3.2008

                passed by the court below does not indicate much

                except   that        the   prayer    for     bail     of     the

                petitioner     was     dismissed    and    that     the    court

                while dismissing the petition for discharge of

                the accused came to a finding that there were

                sufficient      materials indicating the commission

                of an offence under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_1">Section 302</a>/<a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_2">34</a> IPC by the

                accused persons.
</p>
<p id="p_4">                         As may appear from the order passed in

                Cr.Misc.No.48699 of 2006 the petitioner is the

                assailant of the deceased and there is no change

                in that position even after               going through the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                     -2-</span>




case diary.
</p>
<p id="p_5">            What has been contended by the learned

counsel for the petitioner is that the deceased

had come out from jail only three days prior to

the occurrence and was harassing the petitioner

for extorting          money so as to purchasing toddy

or some other drink. There had been some quarrel

in the day as well and at about 11.30 in the

night while the family inmates including                        16-

year- old daughter of the petitioner were there

the deceased came and sat in the cot of the

young lady upon which she raised cry and this

petitioner beheaded the deceased with a sword.

There is support of the defence story in some of

the paragraphs like 46, 47, 53 and 54, the lady

being      examined    in    53,    but    on perusal      of   the

place      of    occurrence        which     is   described     in

paragraph 14, I find that there was no                          cot

found at the spot. There was some blood there

and     the     dead      body     was     also   lying    there,

considering which the prayer is dismissed.

</p><p id="p_6">            Before I parting with the present order

it    is   noted       that       the    Presiding   Officer    of

F.T.C.No.II, Vaishali at Hajipur appears not a

diligent        officer     and    does    not    care    for   the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                            -3-</span>




        liberties of a person.         The man is in lying in

        custody since last two years and the officer is

        taking his    own time in framing the charges only

        when this court is          desirous of knowing as to

        what was the development in         the case. The court

        is not happy with the          things as have happened

        in   the   court   below as     regard the   trial.   The

        trial must be concluded within nine months at

        any rate whereafter the petitioner may renew his

        prayer for bail.
