     2017                     Ganesh Chandra Das
                                     Versus
                         The State of West Bengal &amp; ors.


              Mr. N. I. Khan,
              Mr. Amlan Kumar Mukherjee.
                                      ....... For the Petitioner.
              Mr. Subhabrata Datta,
              Mr. Banibrata Datta.
                                      ...... For the State.


                        The petitioner has filed this application

              under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India

              challenging the resolution of the Board Meeting dated

              August 10, 2016 of the Regional Transport Authority,

              Kolkata, by which application of the petitioner dated

              May 23, 2016 for grant of permit to ply the stage

              carriage in route No.219, 219/1 was rejected for non-

              availability of the vacancy.

                        On May 23, 2016 the petitioner filed an

              application for grant of permit to ply the stage

              carriage in the route number 219, 219/1, from

              Nagerbazar to Howrah Station before the respondent</pre>

<p id="p_1">              No.2 along with the requisite fee. The application of

              the petitioner was rejected for non-availability of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                          2</span>


vacancy by a Board Meeting dated August 10, 2016 of

the    respondent        No.2.      By      submitting     one

representation before the respondent No.3 and the

respondent No.4 on January 27, 2017. The petitioner

has brought to the notice of the respondents that five

vehicles plying in the route number 219, 219/1 are

not plying and as such, there are vacancies for

consideration of the application of the petitioner for

grant of permit of stage carriage in the said route. On

the    other     hand,       Mr.   Sen,     learned    counsel

representing State respondents submits that the

route in question is restricted route and the number

has been restricted by issuing notification under

Section 71 (3) (a) of the <a href="/doc/785258/" id="a_2">Motor Vehicles Act</a>, 1988. He

further submits that the vacancy in a route does not

arise for non-plying of the vehicles for which permit

was granted by the concerned authority, because a

particular vehicle may remain out of order or may not

be available in the route for some mechanical failure.

He    also     submits   that      the    Regional    Transport

Authority will have to take a decision for cancellation

of the permit already granted after giving the holders

of the permit reasonable opportunity of hearing, in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                        3</span>


default, the vacancy cannot arise in a particular

route.
</p>
<p id="p_2">          Having heard learned counsel representing

the both parties I fully agree with the submission

made by Mr. Sen that the vacancy in a particular

route cannot arise only because of absence of some

vehicles for which permit was granted for plying on

the said route. The procedure of law is to be followed

for cancellation of the permit, which is already

granted in favour of the holder of the permit to ply a

particular stage carriage in a particular route.

</p><p id="p_3">          Under such circumstances, I do not find

any merit in the submission of Mr. Khan that there

are vacancies in route number 219, 219/1 for which

the representation submitted by the petitioner on

January   27,   2017       (Annexure   P-4   of   the   writ

application) needs to be considered.

</p><p id="p_4">          In view of the above findings I cannot

persuade myself to give any relief to the petitioner in

the instant writ application. The petitioner is at

liberty to file application for grant of permit whenever

vacancy arises in the concerned route. So the writ

application is dismissed.
