BEFORE THE MADURAI BENCH OF MADRAS HIGH COURT               

DATED: 24.11.2015  

CORAM   

THE HON'BLE MR.JUSTICE S.VAIDYANATHAN          
                                                                        
W.P.(MD) No.20187 of 2015  

Nagarajan                       ... Petitioner

-vs-

1.      The Assistant Commissioner of Police, 
        Srirangam, Trichy.

2.      The Inspector of Police,
        Government Hospital Police Station,
        Trichy.                 .. Respondents 
Prayer: Petition filed under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India for
issuance of a writ of Mandamus, directing the respondents to consider the
petitioner's representation dated 03.10.2015 seeking to remove his name from
the history sheet on the file of the 2nd respondent.

!For Petitioner         :       Mr.N.Anandakumar

For Respondents :       Mr.S.Chandrasekar          
                                Govt. Advocate 

:ORDER  
</pre>
<p id="p_1">        This petition has been filed, seeking a direction to the respondents to
consider the petitioner's representation dated 03.10.2015 seeking to remove
his name from the history sheet on the file of the 2nd respondent.
</p>
<p id="p_2">        2. The case of the petitioner is that though no case has been booked
against him after 2012, his name has not been removed from the list of
history sheet rowdies maintained by the respondent police. Therefore, the
petitioner is before this Court seeking for relief stated above.
</p>
<p id="p_3">        3. The 2nd respondent has filed a counter, in which it has been stated
that the petitioner, who is running a hotel, namely, Vekkaliamman Fast Food
at Trichy, is in association with several anti social elements and that he is
being closely monitored, pursuant to the existence of the history sheet. It
has been further stated that the petitioner has been convicted in a case in
Crime No.117 of 2011, registered by the Trichirappalli City Govt. Hospital
Police in respect of offences under Section 5 r/w 7 of Lottery Regular Act,
1998 and in yet another case in Crime No.224 of 2012 filed by the same
Police, he has been acquitted.
</p>
<p id="p_4">        4. Heard the counsel on either side.
</p>
<p id="p_5">        5. Admittedly, there is no case pending against the petitioner for more
than two years. This Court, in an earlier occasion, while dealing with the
similar issue, had passed an order in the case of Madhan Kalidass vs. The
Superintendent of Police, Thanjavur District and others [W.P.(MD) No.4786 of
2011] decided on 03.02.2014, wherein it has been held as under:
</p><p id="p_6">        "11. I entirely agree with the contention of the learned Senior Counsel
appearing for the petitioner that Clause 749 of the Police Standing Order
will not be applicable to the petitioner as by reading of the provisions in
Clause 749 it mainly refers to <a href="/doc/622891/" id="a_2">Sections 106</a> to <a href="/doc/291822/" id="a_3">110</a> of Criminal Procedure Code
and other provisions mentioned therein. The petitioner is not a suspect.
Similarly, the petitioner has not been convicted.  Hence History Sheets
cannot be opened against the petitioner in that category.  The History Sheets
can be opened for the persons against whom the cases are pending, but it can
be kept alive only for two years as per Clause 748 of the Police Standing
Orders.  It can be extended beyond two years provided there is a proper
extension in terms of Clause 748.  The writ petition has been filed on
19.01.2011.  The History Sheets No.666 could be kept opened only upto 
December 2012, as the Police Standing Order indicates as to how and in what
manner the History Sheets can be continued.     
</p>
<p id="p_7">        14.     This Court in a judgment in S.Vani and Others -vs- Superintendent
of Police, Sivagangai District and others reported in (2009) 3 MLJ 825 and in
the matter of  <a href="/doc/1411102/" id="a_4">Ganesan -vs- The District Superintendent of Police,
Virudhunagar District, Virudhunagar and others</a> reported in 2010 (6) CTC 507
and in the matter of Selvaraj and others -vs- The Inspector of Police,
Kaliakavilai Police Station, Kaliakavilai, Kanyakumari District and two
others reported in 2010 Writ L.R.335 has held that opening of History Sheets
and  publishing photo of individual without factual basis and material
evidence and keeping them under surveillance would amount to interference in
their right of privacy.  This Court held that such an act is against the
right guaranteed under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_5">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India.  This Court
held that keeping surveillance or vigil of History Sheet persons, should not
be permanent, mechanical as it would have affect the freedom of life and
liberty.  The discretion conferred on the police is objective and not
subjective in nature.  If a person is known as History Sheet person, it could
amount to tainting with image in the society and the relationship with those
would be stigmatic.  The innocent children of the petitioner, could be even
looked down.  The police must understand that every person wants to live with
dignity and cannot be condemned arbitrarily.  Opening and retaining of
history sheet has got to be exercised within a definite limit. In the case
reported in in the matter of  <a href="/doc/1411102/" id="a_6">Ganesan -vs- The District Superintendent of
Police, Virudhunagar District, Virudhunagar and others</a> reported in 2010 (6) CTC 507,
it is held that retaining of a person's name in the History Sheet without any
material and without recording any reason, is per se arbitrary."
</p><p id="p_8">        6. Considering the facts and circumstances of the case and also taking
into account the fact there is no record of registration of cases against the
petitioner for the last two years, the respondents are directed to consider
the representation of the petitioner dated 30.10.2015 for removal of his name
from the list of history sheeted rowdies and pass suitable orders thereon
preferably on or before 01.02.2016.
</p><p id="p_9">        7. However, it is made clear that this order shall not preclude the
respondent police from opening history sheet against the petitioner in case
he is found indulging in any other offence in future. No costs. Consequently,
connected miscellaneous petition is closed.
