Prayer:	Civil Revision Petition is filed under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_1">Article 227</a> of Constitution of India, against the fair and decreetal order dated 01.08.2014 in I.A.No.16997 of 2012 in O.S.No.4515 of 2010 on the file of the XI Assistant Judge, City Civil Court, Chennai. 

			For Petitioner 	:Mr.R.Murugesan
			
					 
O R D E R
</pre><p id="p_1">	The first defendant has filed this revision petition challenging the fair and decreetal order dated 01.08.2014 in I.A.No.16997 of 2012 in O.S.No.4515 of 2010 on the file of the XI Assistant Judge, City Civil Court, Chennai. 
</p>
<p id="p_2">	2.At the time of admission,  argument of the learned counsel for the revision petitioner is heard in length.
</p>
<p id="p_3">	3.The first respondent herein as a plaintiff filed a suit for specific performance. The first defendant/revision petitioner herein has filed a written statement and contested the same. The suit was dismissed for default on 14.08.2012. So the plaintiff filed an application in I.A.No.16997 of 2012 under Order IX Rule 9 of C.P.C. for restoration of the suit and the trial Court, after hearing objection on the other side, allowed the application, against which, the present revision petition is preferred by the first defendant/revision petitioner. 	
</p>
<p id="p_4">	4.Learned counsel for the revision petitioner submitted that the first respondent/plaintiff ought to have given sufficient cause for his non appearance, when the suit came up for hearing. In the affidavit filed in support of the application, he has not given any sufficient cause and that has been considered by the trial Court in para-6 of its order. But the trial Court allowed the application on payment of costs,  which is illegal. Hence, he prayed for allowing the revision petition. 
</p>
<p id="p_5">	5.Considered the submission made by the learned counsel for the revision petitioner and perused the typed set of papers. 
</p>
<p id="p_6">	6.The first respondent herein as a plaintiff filed a suit stating that the third defendant/third respondent herein as a power agent of first defendant and his mother Kullammal has entered into a sale agreement with the plaintiff on 04.09.1998 for Rs.2,25,000/-, for which, the plaintiff has paid an advance of Rs.2,00,000/-. The said Kullammal died on 18.01.2007. Since the defendants, who are legal heirs of Kullammal were not ready and willing to perform their part of contract thereafter, the plaintiff filed a suit for specific performance.
</p>
	
<p id="p_7">	7.The revision petitioner/first defendant filed a written statement stating that the property is solely belonging to Kullammal, who is his mother and the execution of the power of attorney is also admitted. Further, it was stated that he is not aware of the facts of sale agreement executed by his power agent. 
</p>
<p id="p_8">	8.On perusal of records, it reveals that already the case was listed for trial on 01.03.2012 and the plaintiff filed his proof affidavit and sought for several adjournments to mark the original allotment order as directed by the trial Court. Since the plaintiff did not appear and mark the document till 14.08.2012, the suit was dismissed for default. 
</p>
<p id="p_9">	9.Now it is appropriate to consider whether any sufficient cause has been given by the plaintiff/first respondent for his non-appearance and marking of the document? In para-3 of the affidavit filed in support of the application, it was stated that the Court had directed him to file the original allotment order, since it was misplaced, he was not in a position to mark the same. Hence, he requested the trial Court to grant time for filing that document, but the trial Court refused and dismissed the suit on 14.08.2012. 
</p>
<p id="p_10">	10.On perusal of the order of the trial Court, it would reveal that the suit was listed on 01.03.2012 and since the plaintiff has not appeared and marked the document till 14.08.2012, the suit was dismissed for default.  But admittedly, the case was in part heard stage and because the first respondent/plaintiff has misplaced the original allotment order and he was not in a position to file the same before the trial Court, he was not appeared. Since the suit is filed by the plaintiff for specific performance, an opportunity must be given to him to putforth his case. 
</p>
<p id="p_11">	11.Under such circumstances, even though the trial Court held that the averments in the affidavit filed in support of the application is contrary to the adjudication, it was correctly held that to render complete justice, an opportunity must be given to the plaintiff and on that basis only, conditional order has been passed. So I am of the considered opinion, the fair and decreetal order passed by the trial Court does not warrant any interference and the revision petition is dismissed as devoid of merits. 
</p>

<p id="p_12">	12.In the result, the Civil Revision Petition is dismissed after confirming the fair and decreetal order dated 01.08.2014 in I.A.No.16997 of 2012 in O.S.No.4515 of 2010 on the file of the XI Assistant Judge, City Civil Court, Chennai. No costs. Consequently, connected Miscellaneous Petition is closed.
