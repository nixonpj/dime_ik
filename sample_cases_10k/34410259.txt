  the time of execution of said two sale deeds Ex. PW-1/2 and Ex. PW-1/1.



</p><p id="p_16">CS-147/13/07                                                Page:-12/22
   He even admitted that he did not got these facts mentioned in his written

  statement deliberately. The abovesaid admissions on the part of DW-1

  have completely falsified his stand earlier taken that he did not sell the

  land to anyone and rather the said admissions have strengthen the case

  of the plaintiffs that the suit land was sold by Sh. Chattar Singh and Sh.

  Hari Kishan to the subsequent owners namely M/s Kamal Plastics and

  Smt. Nirmal Goel and Ex. PW-1/1 and Ex. PW-1/2. Once the ownership

  of M/s Kamal Plastics and Smt. Nirmal Goel are proved on record, hence

  it is made out that they were fully competent to sell the land in question to

  father of plaintiffs Sh. Ram Niwas and documents executed on their

  behalf in favour of father of plaintiffs Sh. Ram Niwas are duly proved on

  record by PW-1 as Ex. PW-1/3, Ex. PW-1/4 to Ex. Pw-1/10 which

  documents are registered documents. Though during cross examination

  when question was put to       defendant DW-1 that did he initiated any

  proceedings to challenge the ownership documents and the previous

  chains belongs to the plaintiffs till date, he stated that he filed a suit in

  which he obtained stay and copy of which has already been filed in the

  present case.    Certified copy of one suit filed by the defendant no. 1

  against the plaintiffs herein though is available but the said suit was only



CS-147/13/07                                                 Page:-13/22
   for permanent injunction wherein injunction order was sought against the

  plaintiffs herein from entering into the suit premises, however, no copy of

  any suit filed by the defendant no. 1 for cancellation of said sale deeds or

  documents had been placed on record by the defendants. Hence, in view

  of the above the sale of suit plots by M/s Kamal Plastics and Smt. Nirmal

  Goel to the father of plaintiffs as well as subsequent sale of said plots to

  plaintiffs by father of plaintiffs duly stand proved on record and plaintiffs

  are held to be the owner of said plots measuring 250 sq. yds and 300 sq.

  yds. in khasra bearing no. 9/24 respectively. However as far as the case

  of plot measuring 300 sq. yds sold by Sh. H. C. Singhal to father of

  plaintiffs Sh. Ram Niwas is concerned only one document i.e. Ex.

  PW-1/11 which is a GPA executed by Sh. H .C. Singhal in favour of Sh.

  Ram Niwas is placed on record but there is nothing on record to show

  that the said piece of land was sold by Sh. Chattar Singh and Sh. Hari

  Kishan to Sh. H.C. Singhal and the chain of the document in respect of

  said piece of land is not complete. GPA Ex. PW-1/11 is not sufficient to

  hold that any sale transaction took place between the erstwhile owner i.e

  defendants and Sh. H.C. Singhal and in absence of the same plaintiffs

  cannot be held to be the owner of said piece of land measuring 300 sq.



CS-147/13/07                                                 Page:-14/22
   yds..   As it is admitted case of parties that defendant no. 1 is in

  possession of the suit land and    plaintiffs are held to be the owners of

  the plot no. 2 measuring 300 sq. yds and plot no. 3 measuring 250 sq.

  yds. in Block-A, khasra no. 9/24 situated in village Kamruddin Nagar,

  Delhi hence being legal owners they are entitled for possession of the

  said plots.   Now the question arises as to how the suit property is

  identifiable as part of transactions has not been recognised by the court.

  For this we can look into the site plan Ex. PW-1/14-B and sale deeds.

  As per sale deed Ex. PW-1/1 and Ex. PW-1/2 the area can be carved out

  from the site plan Ex. PW-1/14-B. Both the sale deeds are pertaining to

  two plot totally measuring 550 sq. yards i.e. plot no. 2 measuring 300 sq.

  yds and plot no. 3 measuring 250 sq. yds. in Block-A, khasra no. 9/24

  situated in village Kamruddin Nagar, Delhi and as per the said proved site

  plan this area is shown as chardiwari khali plot and shop pertaining to

  some iron goods(lohe ki dukaan). The said site plan Ex. PW-1/14-B is

  otherwise admitted by the defendant no. 1 in cross examination and he

  rather has submitted that portion A to F in the said site plan are involved

  in the present case. As due to reasoning given above the case of the

  plaintiff has been partly rejected qua piece of land measuring 300 sq.



CS-147/13/07                                                Page:-15/22
      yards which was also falling in this portion A to F, so in these

     circumstances, plaintiffs are entitled for possession of area totaling to

     550 sq yards     of plot no. 2 measuring 300 sq. yds and plot no. 3

     measuring 250 sq. yds. in Block-A, khasra no. 9/24 situated in village

     Kamruddin Nagar, Delhi. Hence out of this whole adjudicated portion

     shown in Ex. PW-1/14B now marked by this court in green colour from

     points U,V, W, X, Y, Z starting from point U to V upto points till X to Y the

     plaintiff can take the possession of land measuring 550 sq. yards upto

     the point where the said measurement stands completed. Issue no. 1 is

     accordingly partly decided in favour of the plaintiffs and against the

     defendants.
</p>
<p id="p_17">9.     Issue no. 2 and 3:- Both these issues are taken up together. As

     plaintiffs are already held to be owner of the plot no. 2 measuring 300 sq.

     yds and plot no. 3 measuring 250 sq. yds. in Block-A, khasra no. 9/24

     situated in village Kamruddin Nagar, Delhi and plea of defendants qua

     those plots has been rejected and plaintiff are held entitled for relief of

     possession, hence the status of defendants over the said pieces of suit

     land is nothing but is of an unauthorized occupant and accordingly

     plaintiffs are entitled to recovery mense profit from the defendants. The



CS-147/13/07                                                    Page:-16/22
   plaintiffs have claimed the mesne profit w.e.f 1.10.05 from which date

  they have been deprived of the use of land. Though PW-2 and PW-3

  have deposed that in the month of September, 2005 they came to know

  that the said plot was forcibly occupied by one Chattar Singh but both

  their depositions are hear-se and cannot be relied upon. Further Ex.

  DW-2/6 which is investigation report of police reflects that on 21.9.05

  plaintiffs found out that the suit property was taken in possession by

  Chattar Singh, Hari Kishan and his sons. In Ex. DW-2/6 it was clearly

  mentioned that the plot in question was in possession of Chattar Singh

  which report was dated 17.3.06. There is no legal notice is on record sent

  by the plaintiffs calling upon to pay mesne profit or to hand over the

  possession of the suit land. However copy of FIR Ex. DW-2/3 is on

  record wherein date of offence was recorded as 21.9.05 which FIR was

  lodged by the plaintiffs against the defendants regarding forcible

  possession by the defendants. Hence from the FIR Ex. DW-2/3 it is made

  out that since 21.9.05 the defendants are in unlawful possession of the

  suit plots no. plot no. 2 measuring 300 sq. yds and plot no. 3 measuring

  250 sq. yds. in Block-A, khasra no. 9/24 situated in village Kamruddin

  Nagar, Delhi and therefore plaintiff is entitled to recover the mesne profit



CS-147/13/07                                                 Page:-17/22
   since then.   Though plaintiff has claimed the future mesne profit @ Rs.

  20,000/- per month and claimed Rs.2,60,000/- towards arrears of mesne

  profit but plaintiffs have failed to produce anything on the record to show

  that   a similar property was fetching      such huge rent which even

  otherwise is on a higher side. Reliance is placed upon 2010 (116) DRJ

  539 &amp; 2008 (104) DRJ 246 wherein it was held that to determine the

  point of damages the court can take into consideration the manifold

  increase in rent in the area and also take judicial notice of the same.

  Even if there is no substantial evidence the court can take judicial notice

  of the fact that rent in the Delhi has been rising staggeringly and there is

  no illegality in taking judicial notice of the said increase and even if no

  documentary evidence is being lead the court can fix the rent keeping in

  mind the prime location of the property. In the present case when there is

  nothing on record and also not have been proved by either of the parties

  regarding the rent, then the court has to apply its discretion after taking

  into consideration the situation, size of premises and other circumstances

  as brought on record.      Accordingly this court applying its discretion,

  hereby award damages and mesne profit to the plaintiffs against the

  defendant @ Rs.2,000/- per month w.e.f 21.9.05         till vacant peaceful



CS-147/13/07                                                 Page:-18/22
   possession of the suit property is handed over by the defendant to the

  plaintiffs. These issues are accordingly decided in favour of the plaintiffs

  and against the defendants.
</p>
<p id="p_18">10.Issue no. 4:- As far as this issue is concerned defendants have raised

  objection that suit is hit by resjudicata since decree of permanent

  injunction on the averment that the defendant no. 1 is bhoomidar of suit

  property has been decreed and thereafter the plaintiffs have not preferred

  any appeal and withdraw the same from the Hon'ble High Court. The Ld.

  Civil Judge has passed the order on interim application filed by the

  defendant in civil suit no. 26/06 against which an MCA no. 71/06 was

  preferred by the plaintiff which was also dismissed and thereafter the

  plaintiffs have preferred the Regular second appeal before Hon'ble High

  Court and the same has been withdrawn by saying that the plaintiff has

  filed the suit for possession, hence the findings given by Ld. Civil Court in

  suit no. 26/06 and MCA no. 71/06 has attained finality and the suit is hit

  by rejudicata. Though no particulars have been filed as to why present

  suit is hit by resjudicata but perusal of the record it transpires that some

  previous litigations has been referred on record. One suit pertains to

  injunction filed by the defendant no. 1 against the plaintiffs herein seeking



CS-147/13/07                                                 Page:-19/22
   restraint orders against plaintiffs herein from entering into the premises

  for land measuring 700 sq. yards. Vague particulars of land are

  mentioned in para no. 5 of the plaint Ex. DW-1/P-3 and it has not been

  made out that suit property in said case is same as that in the present

  suit. Moreover nature of controversy is different because cause of actions

  for filing that suit was for injunction whereas present case is for

  possession on the basis of sale deeds so pronounced by the plaintiffs.

  The suit for possession is not barred by suit for injunction moreover the

  fate of the suit has not been brought on record.       So the defendants

  themselves have not brought anything on record to substantiate their

  claim and on the other hand plaintiffs themselves have brought the copy

  of that suit to rebutt the plea of resjudicata submitted by the defendants.

  The second document is Ex. DW-1/P-1 whereby the revenue authorities

  were directed to decide the application of the petitioner Chattar Singh

  who is defendant no. 1 herein to be declared as bhumidar. The plaintiffs

  herein are not party to the same and moreover it is on the basis of his

  bhumidari rights that the defendant no. 1 had executed sale deeds Ex.

  PW-1/1 and PW-1/2 so these proceedings are rather proving some right

  in the defendant no. 1 and cannot constitute resjudicata. Accordingly, in



CS-147/13/07                                                Page:-20/22
   view of the above the present suit cannot be stated to be hit by

  resjudicata and this issue is decided in favour of plaintiffs and against the

  defendants.
</p>
<p id="p_19">11.Issue no. 5:- The onus to prove issue no. 5 was on the defendants but

  no evidence has been led on the same, hence defendants              failed to

  discharge his onus. Further, plaintiff had valued the suit property at the

  time of filing the suit @ Rs.15,00,000/-    for relief of possession for suit

  property and Rs.2,60,000/- for relief of mesne profit and paid the court

  fees accordingly. Nothing has been produced on record to show that

  plaintiff wrongly valued the suit property. Hence this issue is decided in

  favour of the plaintiffs and against the defendant.

</p><p id="p_20">12.Relief:- In view of the above, instant suit is partly decreed with cost in

  favour of the plaintiffs and against the defendants and decree of

  possession is passed in favour of plaintiffs and against the defendants

  whereby defendants are directed to hand over the peaceful vacant

  possession of the     plot no. 2 measuring 300 sq. yds and plot no. 3

  measuring 250 sq. yds. in Block-A, khasra no. 9/24 situated in village

  Kamruddin Nagar, Delhi totalling to Rs.550 sq. yards as per site plan Ex

  PW-1/14-B within two months from today. However it is made clear that



CS-147/13/07                                                 Page:-21/22
   decree of 550 sq. yds. is granted to the plaintiff and rest of the case of

  plaintiff for another 300 sq. yards of land is hereby dismissed. So in

  these circumstances out of this whole adjudicated portion shown in Ex.

  PW-1/14B now marked by this court in green colour from points U,V, W,

  X, Y, Z starting from point U to V upto points till X to Y the plaintiff can

  take the possession of land measuring 550 sq. yards upto the point

  where the said measurement stands completed. Defendants are also

  held liable to pay damages @ 2,000/- per month w.e.f           21.9.05   till

  vacation of the suit premises by them. Decree sheet be prepared after

  payment of court fees on the mesne profit.     File be consigned to record
