CORAM: HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE ARUN PALLI

Present:          Mr. Jasdev S. Thind, Advocate for the petitioner.


ARUN PALLI, J. (Oral)

<p id="p_1">                  Notice of motion.
</p>
<p id="p_2">                  Mr. RK Doon, AAG, Haryana, present in Court, accepts notice

on behalf of the respondents. Copies furnished.
</p>
<p id="p_3">                  For the nature of order I propose to pass in the matter, no

formal written statements/counter affidavits on behalf of the respondents are

indeed necessary, at this stage. Thus, with the consent of the parties, the

petition is being disposed of finally.
</p>
<p id="p_4">                  The petitioner competed for selection to the post of Station

Supervisor, in response to the advertisement dated 10.07.2015 (Annexure

P1), under the Outstanding Sports Person (SC) Category. He purports to

have qualified the written examination and was even called for scrutiny of

documents on 05.05.2017. The limited grievance that he has is that; in the

list of short-listed candidates, called for interview, his name and roll number

was not depicted. In fact, the circular issued in this regard reveals that no

eligible candidate was found in the category of the petitioner. It is urged that

the candidature of the petitioner appears to have been ignored, for, he neither

appended the Gradation Certificate with the application form nor produced

the same during scrutiny. The petitioner purports to have applied for the

Gradation Certificate to respondent No.2 on 08.05.2017, but the same has

not been issued till date. Even the legal notice dated 16.03.2018 (Annexure

P11), the respondents have been served with, has failed to evoke any

response. Further, it is submitted that although interviews were held on

30.12.2017, but the appointments are yet to be made, thus, the respondents

be directed to consider the claim of the petitioner and pass appropriate

orders.
</p>
<p id="p_5">                  In   response,   learned    State    counsel    submits   that   the

claim/grievance of the petitioner, as also the legal notice dated 16.03.2018

(Annexure P11), shall be considered and dealt with by the respondents

within a period of four weeks from today. And, appropriate orders, in

accordance with law, shall be passed and communicated to the petitioner as

also his counsel.
</p>
<p id="p_6">                  The petition is accordingly, disposed of, in the above terms.

However, in the event the claim of the petitioner is declined, the respondent-

authorities shall pass a comprehensive order assigning reasons in support

thereof.</p><pre id="pre_2">
