                              September 20, 2016

Hon'ble Servesh Kumar Gupta, J.
</pre><p id="p_1">           Both these petitions having been initiated by the
same applicants and the opposite parties are also the
same, hence have been heard together and are being
adjudicated by this common judgment.
</p>
<p id="p_2">           It is also pertinent to mention that the nature of
controversy between the parties is also identical and the
subject of such dispute is also the same, which is the
property situated in Survey No. 100, popularly known as
Tabor Bungalow in Landhora area at Mussoorie, District
Dehradun.
</p>
<p id="p_3">           Petition no. 989/2016 challenges filing of the
complaint case no. 2191/2016 by the respondent no. 2 and
the cognizance order passed therein on the same day by
the learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Dehradun, i.e.
respondent no. 1. This complaint was filed mentioning
Section 261/331 of the Cantonment Act, 2006 (hereinafter
referred     to    as   the   'New       Act').    Complaint      case   no.
2190/2016 was filed mentioning Section 239(1)/331 of the
New Act, whereupon the cognizance order was passed on
the   same        day   on    16.6.2016       by    the   Chief    Judicial
Magistrate, Dehradun and the same have been assailed
before this Court by way of filing C482 Petition No.
990/2016. Applicants/accused persons have been asked to
stand trial for the said offences, but they have challenged
the initiation of both complaint cases and the cognizance
orders passed thereon by way of filing the instant petitions
under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_3">Section 482</a> CrPC invoking the powers of this Court
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                              3</span>



to quash such complaint cases as well as the orders of
cognizance.
</p>
<p id="p_4">        Learned Counsel of the applicants/petitioners has
placed his erudite arguments in order to convince the
Court. At the outside, he drew the attention of this Court
towards the various provisions of the New Act, viz. <a href="/doc/897083/" id="a_4">Sections
239</a>, <a href="/doc/1780550/" id="a_5">311</a>, <a href="/doc/1673480/" id="a_6">314</a> prescribing the Schedule IV, 331, 337 and
has vehemently argued that <a href="/doc/605427/" id="a_7">Section 331</a> contemplates the
launching of the prosecution, while <a href="/doc/897083/" id="a_8">Section 239(1)</a> wherefor
the complaint case no. 2190/2016 was launched and
<a href="/doc/765548/" id="a_9">Section 261</a> wherefor complaint case no. 2191/2016 was
launched, both do not find place in Schedule IV of the New
Act. Therefore, no offence inasmuch as launching of this
prosecution is made out against the applicants.
</p>
<p id="p_5">        The Court is not convinced with the aforementioned
argument for the reason that the Schedule IV, as envisaged
under Section 314 of the New Act, contemplates the cases
in which police may arrest without warrant. Here, the
controversy is not regarding the arrest, but of launching of
the prosecution. <a href="/doc/897083/" id="a_10">Section 239(1)</a> or <a href="/doc/765548/" id="a_11">Section 261</a>, as the case
may be, defines the offence and the penal provision for the
same has been contemplated in Section 247 of the New Act.
So, simply for the reason that <a href="/doc/1515740/" id="a_12">Section 247</a> has not been
mentioned by the launcher of the prosecution is hardly of
any avail.
</p>
<p id="p_6">        It was further argued by the learned Counsel of the
accused/applicants   that   respondent   no.   2   was   not
competent to set on this prosecution through the Chief
Executive Officer because, as averred in the counter
affidavit dated 24.8.2016, there was no Resolution No. 9
dated 22.6.2010 of making authorisation of the Chief
Executive Officer for the purpose. Rather, such Resolution
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                   4</span>



No. 9 was passed on 19.6.2010 and that too conferring the
authority upon the Chief Executive Officer to file the
prosecution for the offence specified in Schedule IV of the
New Act.
</p>
<p id="p_7">        The above argument has been refuted by the
learned Counsel of the Cantonment Board by drawing
attention of this Court towards the letter dated 9.12.1990,
written by the Director, Cantonment Board, Central
Command, to all the Chief Executive Officers (In Central
Command). In this letter, reference has been made to
another letter no. 96659/Vol.V/LC2 dated 18.9.1989,
wherein it has been observed that the construction in
violation of the provisions of the Cantonment Act, 1924
(Old Act) are on the increase, and one of the reasons is that
apart from lack of vigilance and ineffective measures,
provisions of the Act are not being enforced strictly. In all
the   cases    relating      to   unauthorized   constructions,
prosecution should be launched under <a href="/doc/1238664/" id="a_13">Section 184</a> and
notices under <a href="/doc/1551941/" id="a_14">Section 185</a> be issued promptly, followed by
notices under Section 256 of the Act. It has been further
depicted in the letter referred to above that the launching of
prosecution under <a href="/doc/1238664/" id="a_15">Section 184</a> will strengthen the action
under <a href="/doc/1551941/" id="a_16">Section 185</a> and deter illegal constructions. It is
expected that the penalty of a deterrent amount of fine, as
envisaged in the Section 184 of the Cantonment Act, (which
clearly states that whoever begins, continues or completes
the erection or re-erection of the building illegally is
punishable with fine which may extent upto Rs.5, 000/-)
will have salutary effect.
</p>
<p id="p_8">        In this reference, Section 360 of the New Act is
relevant which makes the provisions about the repeals and
savings. Although New Act repeals the Old Act, but with the
savings, as have been contemplated in sub-section (2) of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                5</span>



<a href="/doc/755395/" id="a_17">Section    360</a>   and    such   sub    provision   saves    any
appointment, notification, order, scheme, rule, form, notice
or bye-law made or issued and any license or permission
granted under the Act ..........
</p>
<p id="p_9">          Learned Counsel of the petitioners submitted that
all these words do not contain the word "resolution",
whereby the Chief Executive Officer had derived the powers
for initiating the prosecution. This contention is also not
substantial because the word "resolution" is of the like
nature and akin to the words, as have been aforestated. So,
if he was vested with the powers to launch the prosecution
by way of the letter dated 18.9.1989, issued under the Old
Act, then it is identical, in nature, to what has been
demonstrated in Section 360(2)(a) of the New Act.
</p>
<p id="p_10">          It was further argued that both these complaints
were time barred because Section 337 of the New Act
adumbrates only six months for launching the prosecution
from the date of commission of offence and in this regard,
the petitioners had already sent a letter dated 3.11.2015 to
the   Cantonment       Board   authorities   informing    them
regarding the completion of their minor repairs. Therefore,
these complaints are time barred and, being as such,
should be nipped in the bud.
</p>
<p id="p_11">          I think that this contention also does not hold
water for the reason that in the letter dated 3.11.2015,
there was information regarding the minor repairs only,
while the present controversy arose when the Junior
Engineer of the Cantonment Board informed the Chief
Executive Officer that unauthorised construction is going
on in the said property. He requested to pass the 'stop
construction' orders for the same. Chief Executive Officer
promptly passed such orders on 4.5.2016 under Section
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                6</span>



239 of the New Act. Further, a letter was written by the
Junior Engineer Mr. Prem Singh Rawat on 10.5.2016
informing that huge construction materials including the
storage of stones, iron rods, guarders, cements, wooden
planks, etc. are lying there and the petitioners had erected
tin sheets of 15 feet height in order to conceal such
materials and the ongoing construction on the property
and this temporary wall of tin sheets was against the
permitted standards of 2.5 metres. An inspection was made
by a committee of officials including the Junior Engineer of
the Cantonment Board, during which, in addition to above
facts, 10-15 labourers were also found working at the spot.
So, the Chief Executive Officer by the order dated
31.5.2016 asked the petitioners to remove all such
materials from the spot and on their failure to do so, some
of the materials were seized on 8.6.2016.
</p>
<p id="p_12">        Learned Counsel of the petitioners has also drew
the attention of the Court towards <a href="/doc/1417508/" id="a_18">Section 308</a> and
submitted that it empowers the competent persons in this
regard to enter into the land, but wherefor 3 days notice is
required to be given to the occupier/owner and if due to
some exigency, it is not possible, then under <a href="/doc/1780550/" id="a_19">Section 311</a>,
at least 3 hours notice is mandatory.
</p>
<p id="p_13">        After perusing all these correspondences between
the parties, I do not think that the petitioners failed to have
taken any notice of the prospective entry and the actions
on the part of Cantonment Board against them.
</p>
<p id="p_14">        Apart from the above facts and the legal provisions,
it is the settled proposition, which has been observed by
the Hon'ble Apex Court time and again, that in the
jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_20">Section 482</a> CrPC, High Court is not
supposed to enter into every scrupulous details and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                 7</span>



analysis of each and every fact converting it into a pre-trial
before the actual trial.
</p>
<p id="p_15">        The powers possessed by the High Court under
<a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_21">Section 482</a> CrPC are very wide, but the plentitude of the
power requires great caution in its exercise. Courts must
be careful to see that its decision in exercise of this power
is based on sound principles.
</p>
<p id="p_16">        The scope of <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_22">Section 482</a> CrPC has been clarified
by the Hon'ble Apex Court time and again. A Constitution
Bench of the Hon'ble Apex Court in that regard has
elaborately discussed such scope in the case of <a href="/doc/855018/" id="a_23">Inder
Mohan Goswami &amp; Another v. State of Uttaranchal &amp; others</a>,
(2008) 1 SCC (Cri) 259, and has held that inherent power
under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_24">Section 482</a> CrPC can be exercised: (i) to give effect
to an order under<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_25"> the Code</a>; (ii) to prevent abuse of the
process of court, and (iii) to otherwise secure the ends of
justice. Every High Court has inherent power to act ex
debito justitiae to do real and substantial justice, for the
administration of which alone it exists, or to prevent abuse
of the process of the court. Inherent jurisdiction of the High
Courts under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_26">Section 482</a> CrPC though wide has to be
exercised sparingly, carefully and with great caution and
only when such exercise is justified by the tests specifically
laid down in the section itself. Authority of the court exists
for the advancement of justice. If any abuse of the process
leading to injustice is brought to the notice of the court,
then the court would be justified in preventing injustice by
invoking inherent powers in absence of specific provisions
in the statute. However, the inherent power should not be
exercised to stifle a legitimate prosecution. The High Court
should normally refrain from giving a prima facie decision
in a case where all the facts are incomplete and hazy, more
so, when the evidence has not been collected and produced
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                               8</span>



before the Court and the issues involved, whether factual
or legal, are of such magnitude that they cannot be seen in
their true perspective without sufficient material.
</p>
<p id="p_17">          The above view has further been reiterated by the
Hon'ble Apex Court in <a href="/doc/1126288/" id="a_27">Central Bureau of Investigation v.
K.M. Sharan</a>, 2008 (2) CCSC 815.
</p>
<p id="p_18">          In view of what has been set forth above, I do not
find any force in these petitions. These are hereby
dismissed at the very threshold.
</p>
