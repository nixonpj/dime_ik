                               Challenge in the present revision petition is to the order dated

            19.09.2012 (Annexure P3), passed by the Civil Judge (Sr.Division), Ferozepur,

            whereby, while closing the evidence of the defendant-petitioner, an application

            for comparison of the disputed signatures of the petitioner on documents,

            Exhibits P1 &amp; P2, with his admitted signatures, was rejected.

</p><p id="p_4">                               A perusal of the paperbook would go on to show that the Civil Suit

            for recovery of `3,66,000/- was filed on the strength of a pro-note and on receipt

            dated 07.08.2007. The defendant-petitioner took a specific plea that the said

            pro-note was a forged, false and fabricated document and was never executed by

            him in favour of the plaintiff-respondent. His signatures were not on the said

            document and there was a dispute inter se between the answering-defendant, on

            one side and his erstwhile Commission Agent, M/s Sukhwinder Singh &amp; Sons.

</p><p id="p_5">                               The issues were framed on 12.03.2009 in the said suit, which was

            filed on 21.07.2008. The plaintiff-respondent completed his evidence and closed

            the same only on 10.04.2012 and the case was fixed for 09.05.2012, for

            defendant's evidence, on which date, an adjournment was taken and thereafter

            also, on 07.06.2012, an adjournment was taken. On 28.08.2012, Nachhattar

            Singh, the defendant-petitioner was examined and he suffered an undertaking that

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">             CR No.6076 of 2012 (O&amp;M)                                             -2-</span>

            responsibility and the case was, accordingly, fixed for 19.09.2012, on which date,

            the impugned order was passed, on the ground that the defendant-petitioner had

            taken 4 opportunities and thus, the undertaking had been violated.                   The

            defendant-petitioner had also filed an application at that stage for sending the

            pro-note and the Vakalatnama and the written statement for comparison of the

            petitioner's signatures, which was also rejected by the Trial Court, who was

            obviously biased on account of the fact that the defendant-petitioner had not

            completed his evidence, as undertaken.
</p>
<p id="p_6">                               Thus, it would be apparent that the Trial Court had not given

            adequate opportunity to the defendant-petitioner to lead his evidence. Only 4

            opportunities were granted and out of the same, the defendant-petitioner had

            examined himself and he only got the period from 09.05.2012 to 19.09.2012, to

            lead his evidence whereas, on the other hand, the plaintiff-respondent took his

            time of 3 years to complete his evidence. In such circumstances, the impugned

            order cannot be held to be justified.
</p>
<p id="p_7">                               A specific plea has been taken that the pro-note is forged and in such

            circumstances, the decision on the application was also not in proper perspective

            and the matter should have been examined with closure scrutiny, which the Trial

            Court has failed to do.           Accordingly, this Court is of the opinion that the

            impugned order suffers from patent illegality and the Trial Court has failed to

            exercise jurisdiction vested in it.
</p>
<p id="p_8">                               Accordingly, the impugned order dated 19.09.2012 (Annexure P3) is
            quashed and the closing of the defendants evidence, is set aside. The Trial Court
            shall decide the application for comparison of the specimen signatures, afresh, in
            accordance with law.
</p><p id="p_9">                               With the abovesaid observations, the present revision petition is
            allowed.
