</p><p id="p_5">1.    Challenge in this appeal is to the judgment of conviction and order of

sentence dated 24-05-2012 passed by the First Additional Sessions Judge,

Balodabazar, C.G., in Sessions Trial No.03/2011 whereby and whereunder the

trial Judge after holding the appellants guilty for robbery and at the time of

payment of fine, to further undergo rigorous imprisonment for one month to

each appellants.
</p>
<p id="p_6">2.    Conviction is impugned on the ground that without there being any iota

of evidence, the Court below has convicted and sentenced the appellants as

aforementioned and thereby committed illegality.

</p><p id="p_8">3.    As per the case of the prosecution, on 26-06-2008, at about 9.00 p.m.,

when Anand Gupta (PW-8) was returning to Balodabazar from village Sonadih

via Latua, three persons in a motorcycle made overtake and when the

motorcycle of the complainant got fell down being slipped in the mud, appellant

Satya @ Satyaprakash @ Pradeep (A-1) and other two persons looted him, his

mobile phone and Rs.400/- and also his motorcycle CG 04 CD 0943 and ran

away from the spot. After the incident, Anand Gupta (PW-8)/the complainant,

lodged the First Information Report before Balodabazar police. Police

registered the FIR (Ex.-P/10) vide registering the crime number against the

persons who committed the robbery and started investigation. During the

investigation, appellant Manjeet @ Kallu (A-2) gave disclosure statement (Ex.-

P/1). Appellant Satya @ Satyaprakash @ Pradeep (A-1) gave disclosure

statement Ex.-P/2. The looted motorcycle was duly recovered in abandoned

condition. Police arrested both the appellants vide Ex.-P/8 and Ex.-P/9.

Executive Magistrate conducted the test identification parade of both the

appellants. The complainant identified both the appellants during the test

identification parade. The spot map was prepared vide Ex.-P/11. The

statements of the witnesses were recorded under <a href="/doc/447673/" id="a_3">Section 161</a> of the Code of

Criminal Procedure, 1973 (in short 'the Code'). After completion of the

investigation, charge sheet was filed before the Judicial Magistrate First Class,

Balodabazar, who, in turn, committed the case to the Court of Sessions,

Raipur, the learned First Additional Sessions Judge, Balodabazar received the

case on transfer and conducted the trial. During the trial, the appellants were

charged for the offence under <a href="/doc/1865117/" id="a_4">Sections 397</a>, <a href="/doc/835557/" id="a_5">398</a> of the IPC. Both the

appellants denied the charges and prayed for trial.
</p>
<p id="p_9">4.    In order to prove the guilt of the appellants, the prosecution examined

10 witnesses in all. The statements of the appellants were recorded under
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                         -3-</span>




<a href="/doc/140515/" id="a_6">Section 313</a> of the Code wherein they denied the circumstances appearing

against them and pleaded innocence and false implication in crime in question.

</p><p id="p_10">5.     After affording opportunity of hearing to the parties, the learned trial

Court convicted and sentenced the appellants as aforementioned.

</p><p id="p_11">6.     I have heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the judgment

impugned and record of the trial Court.
</p>
<p id="p_12">7.     Learned counsel appearing for the appellants submitted that they are

not contesting the instant appeal for the point of conviction, instead they are

assailing the quantum of sentence awarded by the trial Court to the appellants.

Learned counsel further submitted that as per certificate of detention issued by

the trial Court affixed along with the judgment of the trial Court, appellant Satya

@ Satyaprakash @ Pradeep (A-1) served the major part of the sentence. He

remained in custody from 02-02-2009 to 22-06-2009 and thereafter from 28-

11-2009 to till date, thereby he has completed his detention period of 5 years

10 months and 3 days in all. Appellant Manjeet @ Kallu (A-2) remained in

custody for serving the major part of the sentence from 02-02-2009 to till date,

this appellant remained in custody for 6 years 3 months and 9 days. Both the

appellants were of the age of 25 years and 19 years respectively. They were

the first offender with no criminal past. They will not commit any offence in

future. They may be given an opportunity to remain in society without

committing any crime. Though in arrest memo Ex.-P/8 and Ex.-P/9 in para 12

for every part police gave positive report but to substantiate police had not

annexed any document regarding the previous conduct. Hence, as arrest

memo says regarding the conduct and previous criminal record but to prove no

document is filed along with the charge sheet. There is no minimum sentence

provided for offence under <a href="/doc/329571/" id="a_7">Section 392</a> of the IPC. No any revolver/firearm was
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                        -4-</span>




seized from their possession. They may be sentenced for the period already

undergone by them.
</p>
<p id="p_13">8.     Per contra, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the State/respondent

opposed the argument advanced on behalf of the appellants and submitted

that at about 9.00 p.m. the appellants looted the motorcycle, Rs.400/- and one

mobile after being armed with deadly weapon. Looking to the conduct and act,

there is no scope for reduction of the sentence. Hence, the prayer may be

dismissed and the judgment of conviction and sentence may be affirmed.

</p><p id="p_14">9.     In order to appreciate the arguments advanced on behalf of the parties,

I have perused the evidence adduced by the prosecution.

</p><p id="p_15">10.    As the appellants are not contesting this criminal appeal regarding their

conviction part, even otherwise, the complainant vide test identification parade

(Ex.-P/7) duly identified both the appellants and he is corroborated by the

Executing Magistrate who conducted the test identification parade, the FIR was

lodged within time, there is no reason to have any doubt over the test

identification parade and in the entire statement made by complainant Anand

Gupta (PW-8) before the Court, in view of this Court, the trial Court was very

right to hold guilty both the appellants for offence under <a href="/doc/329571/" id="a_8">Section 392</a> of the IPC,

thus, there is no scope for any interference with the conviction part awarded by

the trial Court.
</p>
<p id="p_16">11.    So far as the fine sentence is concerned, the appellants are sentenced

to pay fine of Rs.200/- and in default of payment of fine, to further undergo

rigorous imprisonment for one month. Looking to the act, the fine sentence

may not held as excessive. Hence, the fine sentence awarded by the trial

Court against both the appellants also requires no interference.

</p><p id="p_17">12.    So far as the prayer made for the quantum of sentence is concerned,

the motorcycle looted from the complainant was not recovered from the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                                  -5-</span>




        custody of both the appellants, also no other property was recovered from the

        appellants, motorcycle in question was seized from other place, alleged firearm

        was also not recovered from the appellants, both the appellants were of 25 and

        19 years of age at the time of the incident, no any document annexed along

        with the charge sheet so that to ascertain regarding any previous registration of

        crime or conviction by any Court of Law to the present appellants which goes

        to show that in the absence of any admissible evidence it may not be held that

        the appellants are previous convict, appellant Satya @ Satyaprakash @

        Pradeep (A-1) served the major part of the sentence for 5 years 10 months and

        3 days and appellant Manjeet @ Kallu (A-2) also served almost nearer to the

        entire sentence i.e. for 6 years 3 months and 9 days, looking to the entire facts

        and circumstances and also the facts that the alleged deadly firearm was not

        seized, <a href="/doc/329571/" id="a_9">Section 392</a> of the IPC is not having any minimum sentence barrier, in

        the considered view of this Court, an opportunity has to be given to the

        appellants so that they may remain in society without committing any crime in

        future. It would be appropriate to sentence both the appellants for the period

        already undergone by them.
</p>
<p id="p_18">        13.    Consequently, the appeal filed on behalf of the appellants is allowed in

        part. The judgment of conviction under <a href="/doc/329571/" id="a_10">Section 392</a> of the IPC passed against

        the appellants is hereby affirmed. The fine sentence awarded by the trial Court

        is also hereby maintained. For substantive jail sentence instead of rigorous

        imprisonment for 7 years, both the appellants are sentenced for the period

        already undergone by them. Both the appellants are in jail. They be released

        forthwith, if not required in any other case.
