               =====================
                W.P.(C)No.4820 of 2017 - B
          =========================
         Dated this the 14th day of February, 2017

<p id="p_1">         The petitioner is aggrieved with Ext.P3 conditional

order.  The assessment year is 2012-13.      The petitioner's

contention is that the M-sand production, which was reckoned

as a suppression by the Intelligence Officer and the addition

made of one time was exempted in the relevant year. M-sand

produced by the crusher units were exempted from tax

payment, if the crusher units were compounded. There was

however no compounding provision applicable to the

machinery for making M-sand. However in the year 2014-15,

there was an amendment made, by which the machinery used

for making M-sand was also made compoundable.

</p><p id="p_2">         2.    The learned Counsel for the petitioner hence

submits that at best M-sand could have been taxed

prospectively from 2014-15 and not in the earlier years. The

W.P.(C)No.4820/2017

issue has been answered against the Department by a learned

Single Judge and an appeal is said to be pending before the

Division Bench. Considering the fact that the additional tax

demanded by the Intelligence Officer is entirely with respect to

the suppression detected of M-sand and also the contentions

taken by the petitioner before the Appellate Authority, this

Court is of the opinion that there could be a blanket stay,

insofar as the recovery, while the Appellate Authority considers

the appeal.       Ext.P3 would stand set aside.         The Appellate

Authority is directed to consider the appeal and in the

meanwhile there shall be a stay of recovery.
