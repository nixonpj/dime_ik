ORAL JUDGMENT
Date: 02-02-2015

                    The petitioner is informant of Gandhi Maidan P.S.

        Case No.34 of 2014 dated 23.1.2014 registered for the

        offence punishable under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_1">section 302</a> of the Indian Penal

        Code. The said police case was registered against known

        accused.
</p>
<p id="p_11">                    From a bare reading of the written report it would

        appear that the informant came to know that her father died

        at about 1 a.m. on 23rd January, 2014 in Bankipur Club,

        Patna. When she reached at the place of occurrence at about

        5.30 a.m., she found her father lying on the floor inside the

               club. Some bleeding was also noticed by her from his eyes,

               nostrils and ears. She suspected that her father had been

               killed by some unknown persons.
</p>
<p id="p_12">                           Being aggrieved by slow pace of investigation, the

               petitioner has approached this Court in writ jurisdiction

               under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India. The

               prayer of the petitioner in paragraph-1 of the application is

               as under:-

               conclusion regarding the cause of death of the father of the

               petitioner. He has raised suspicion against impartiality of the

               investigation. He submits that the police are deliberately

               trying to protect some influential person, who may be

               involved in the offence.
</p>
<p id="p_15">                           On the other hand, learned counsel for the State

               has submitted that the investigation of the case is being

               conducted in a fair and impartial manner. According to him,

               till date the police have not been able to come to any

               definite conclusion as to whether it was a case of natural

               death or it was a homicidal death. The doctor, who has

               conducted autopsy has also not given any definite opinion

               regarding the cause of death of the father of the petitioner.

               He has further submitted that the viscera has been preserved

               and the same has been sent for chemical examination and

               the report of the viscera is awaited. He has contended that

               the police have made sincere efforts to bring the case to its

               logical end by making endeavour to reveal the true facts.

</p><p id="p_16">                           Be that as it may, having regard to the facts and

               circumstance of the case, I am not inclined to entertain the

               present application for the simple reason that each case has

               its   own     complexity.        Sometimes   investigation   of   a

               cognizable case may take a longer time but that by itself

                         would not give any reason to doubt the bona fide of

                         investigation.      However,        a    sensitive   and   committed

                         investigation agency is indispensable to the interest of

                         justice.
</p>
<p id="p_17">                                     Since the case is at the stage of investigation and

                         there is no reason for me to doubt the impartiality of

                         investigation, I am not inclined to entertain the present

                         application.
</p>
<p id="p_18">                                     Accordingly, the writ petition is dismissed.
