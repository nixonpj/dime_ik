IN THE COURT OF SH V.K. GOYAL, ADDL. SESSIONS JUDGE: DELHI.


                      CRIMINAL REVISION NO.48/2007.

<p id="p_1">ORDER:-
</p>
<p id="p_2">

</p><p id="p_3">1.            This is a criminal revision petition under <a href="/doc/1457888/" id="a_1">section 397</a> of Cr.P.C.

</p><p id="p_4">     against the order dated 17/04/2007 passed by the learned Link

     Metropolitan Magistrate in criminal case No.567/06 titled as Niti Finance

     &amp; Investment Ltd. Vs. Shri Subhash Chand..
</p>
<p id="p_5">2.            In brief, the facts are that a criminal complaint u/s.138 of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                          2</span>

     <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_2">Negotiable Instruments Act</a> was dismissed by the ld.Trial Court vide

     order dated 17/04/2007 as none was present for the complainant and no

     necessary steps were taken as per previous orders.

</p><p id="p_6">3.            The above order has been challenged by the revisionist on

     various grounds.
</p>
<p id="p_7">4.            It is thus prayed that the impugned order be set aside and

     complaint be restored to its original number.

</p><p id="p_8">5.            I have heard the ld.counsel for the revisionist and have also

     gone through the trial court record carefully.

</p><p id="p_9">6.            Ld.counsel for the revisionist has contended that on the date

     fixed, complainant and his counsel had appeared in the court in the

     morning and they came to know that ld.P.O. was on leave and the case

     will be taken up by the ld.Link MM at 11.30 am. The complainant had to

     appear in some other case which was listed in the court of Sh.Balwant

     Rai Bansal, Metropolitan Magistrate and they remained busy there and

     when they reached before the ld.Link Metropolitan Magistrate and came

     to know that the complaint was dismissed on account of non-

     appearance.
</p>
<p id="p_10">7.            It is further contended by ld.counsel for the revisionist that the

     case of the complainant was also dismissed on non-prosecution and in

     this regard it is submitted by the ld.counsel that the complainant has
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                         3</span>

     taken steps on each and every date but due to inadvertence and under

     the bonafide mistake the step dated 17/04/2007 could not be taken.

     Hence, in these circumstances the dismissal of complaint is harsh order

     and the complainant should have been granted opportunity for taking

     steps keeping in view the fact that the complainant is regularly taking

     steps. Thus, the order passed by the ld.Link Magistrate is more adverse

     than required in the given circumstances.
</p>
<p id="p_11">8.            It is further contended that non-appearance is neither

     intentional nor deliberate and in respect of ground of non-prosecution, it

     is contended that all the necessary steps were taken on each and every

     date of hearing by the complainant.
</p>
<p id="p_12">9.            The short question before this court is whether after

     summoning the accused in a criminal complaint, the revision is

     maintainable or not. It has been held in 2003(3) RCR (Criminal) 340

     titled as Kalpana Tyagi Vs. Sneh Lata Sharma wherein it has been

     held that "A distinction, therefore, has to be drawn in regard to the

     complaints dismissed prior to the summoning of an accused and those

     dismissed subsequent to the summoning of the accused. If a complaint

     is dismissed prior to the summoning of an accused the order may be

     challenged by way of filing a revision but once <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_3">Section 256</a> comes into

     play the dismissal of a complaint has the effect of acquittal of an
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                      4</span>

  accused and only an appeal can be filed under <a href="/doc/487026/" id="a_4">Section 378</a> of the Code

  to challenge his acquittal.
</p>
<p id="p_13">                In this view of the matter, this Court is of the considered

  opinion that the impugned orders passed by the learned Metropolitan

  Magistrate on 21/12/1993, which were passed after summoning and in

  the presence of the respondents accused, <a href="/doc/466785/" id="a_5">Section 256</a> of Code had

  come into play and the dismissal of complaints resulted in acquittal of

  the respondent against which only appeals could be filed. Thus, the

  revision filed by the petitioners were not maintainable and as such this

  Court cannot in exercise of powers under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_6">Section 482</a> of the Code set

  aside the impugned orders.
</p>
<p id="p_14">10.        In view of above, it is clear that after summoning of the

  accused in a criminal complaint, revision petition is not maintainable and

  the only remedy lies is to file an appeal. Accused was summoned long

  back on 12/05/2003 and thereafter he also appeared before the court on

  09/06/2005, 27/07/2005 and 30/08/2005 but thereafter the accused

  absented himself and ultimately process u/s.82 of <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_7">Cr.P.C</a>. with warrant

  of attachment was issued against the accused. In such circumstances, it

  cannot be said that the case was dismissed in default and for non-

  prosecution before summoning the accused in this case. Accordingly, as

  held by Hon'ble High Court of Delhi in the above Judgement, revision is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                   5</span>

 not maintainable. Hence, same is dismissed. Trial court record be sent

 back with the copy of this order. Revision file be consigned to record

 room.
