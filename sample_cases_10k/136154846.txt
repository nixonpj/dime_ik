<p id="p_289"> 03.            The respondent no.1 is the original complainant who had

 filed a complaint under Section 28 of the Maharashtra Recognition of

 Trade Unions &amp; Prevention of Unfair Labour Practices Act, 1971 [for

 short, "the Act of 1971"]. In the Complaint, it has been stated that the

 respondent no.1 is qualified to hold the post of Junior Clerk and since

 6th May, 2014 he has been working on the post of Junior Clerk after his

 appointment. The post on which the respondent no.1 is working is a

 sanctioned post. However, instead of appointing him on a permanent

 and regular post, he has been appointed on temporary basis by giving

 artificial breaks.        Till the filing of the complaint, he had completed

 about three years' continuous service.             It is his further case that on

 completion of 240 days' continuous service, he is entitled to be treated

 as a permanent employee. However, without complying with the

 provisions of <a href="/doc/1056316/" id="a_1">Section 25F</a> and <a href="/doc/41851/" id="a_2">25G</a> of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947

 [for short, "the Act of 1947"], the respondent no.1 was discontinued

 from service. In this backdrop, the respondent no.1 approached the

 Labour Court by filing a Complaint under Item No. 1 of Schedule-IV to

 the Act of 1971.              It was his case that the petitioner - Agricultural

 Produce Market Committee had engaged in unfair labour practice and

 therefore, the complainant was entitled for relief.                 Along with the

 complaint, an application under <a href="/doc/1574478/" id="a_3">Section 30</a> (2) of the Act of 1971 came

 to be filed praying that by way of an interim order, the employer be

 directed to permit the complainant to join duties and allot him work

 during pendency of the Complaint.

 made. By filing reply to the application for interim relief, the employer

 relied upon the provisions of <a href="/doc/1418464/" id="a_4">Section 2</a> (oo) (bb) of the Act of 1947 and

 took the stand that since the appointment of the complainant was for a

 specific period, he was not entitled to any relief of permanency

 thereafter.       It was further stated that the Market Committee was

 governed by the provisions of the Maharashtra Agricultural Produce

 Marketing (Regulation) Act, 1963 [for short, "the Act of 1963"] and it

 was required to follow the relevant rules while making appointments.
</p>
<p id="p_291"> Similarly, necessary permission of the Director of Marketing was also

 required to be obtained and in absence of such permission, no relief

 could be granted to the complainant.                    On expiry of the period of

 engagement,          the      complainant   was     not entitled        for   any relief,

 whatsoever. There was no breach committed of the provisions of

 <a href="/doc/1056316/" id="a_5">Sections 25F</a> and <a href="/doc/41851/" id="a_6">25G</a> of the Act of 1947.

 applications for interim relief.                 After considering the respective

 submissions, it was prima facie found that the complainants were in

 employment for a period exceeding 240 days. They had been

 appointed temporarily on posts which were sanctioned, but had been

 kept vacant. The complainants were discontinued from service without

 complying with the provisions of <a href="/doc/1056316/" id="a_7">Sections 25F</a> and <a href="/doc/41851/" id="a_8">25G</a> of the Act of

 complainants had made out a prima facie case that the employer had

 indulged in unfair labour practice.                     After considering the various

 decisions relied upon by both sides, the learned Judge allowed the

 applications       and        directed   the     petitioner-employer            to    allow    the

 complainants to join duties and perform work as they were doing on

 01st March, 2017 till the decision of the complaints on merits. Thus,

 by order dated 13th July, 2017, the interim applications came to be

 allowed.        Being         aggrieved,       the      Market       Committee-employer

 approached the Industrial Court by filing the Revision Applications.
</p>
<p id="p_293"> The learned Member of the Industrial Court confirmed the order of the

 Labour Court and dismissed the Revision Applications. .
</p>


<p id="p_294"> 06.            Shri U. A. Dastane, learned counsel for the petitioner, in

 support of the Writ Petitions, submitted that both the Courts were not

 justified     in   granting       interim      relief   to   the    complainants.              The

 appointment of each complainant was for a temporary period and

 without       following        the   prescribed         procedure.         In        absence    of

 appointments being made by following the due procedure, the

 complainants were not entitled for the reliefs as sought in the

 complaints.        Thus, if the final relief in the complaints could not be

 granted to the complainants, they would not be entitled for any interim

 relief. It was further submitted that the Model Standing Orders under

 the Act of 1946 were not applicable to the Market Committee and for

 that purpose, it was submitted that the adjudication by this Court in

 Writ Petition No. 5121 of 2006 [Agricultural Produce Market

 Committee, Nagpur Vs. Hon'ble Member, Industrial Court,

 Maharashtra, Nagpur &amp; another]; decided on 7th September, 2011

 as confirmed in Letters Patent Appeal No. 49 of 2012 was subjected to

 challenge before the Hon'ble Supreme Court and that challenge was

 pending. Interim stay had been granted to the effect and operation of

 the judgment of this Court and therefore, it was not open for the

 complainants to urge that the said Model Standing Orders were

 applicable so as to govern their service conditions. The appointments

 of the complainants were of a temporary nature and there was no

 approval granted by the Director of Marketing which was necessary

 under the provisions of the Act of 1963. It was further submitted that

 considering the nature of the orders of appointment, the engagement

 of the complainants would fall under the provisions of <a href="/doc/1418464/" id="a_9">Section 2</a> (oo)

 (bb) of the Act of 1947 and therefore, at the end of the period

 prescribed,       the     complainants   would   have   no     further     right    to

 employment.           The necessary approval granted by the Director of

 Marketing was only till 30th November, 2016 and the continuation of

 the complainants thereafter was without any authority of law. There

 was no breach whatsoever of the provisions of <a href="/doc/1056316/" id="a_10">Sections 25F</a> and <a href="/doc/41851/" id="a_11">25G</a> of

 the Act of 1947. It was, thus, submitted that the Industrial Court

 committed an error in granting interim relief, especially when it could

 be seen that the complainants were not entitled for any final relief in

 the complaints.          In support of his contentions, the learned counsel

 placed reliance on the following decisions:-

</p><p id="p_299"> 07.            Shri K. A. Patil, learned counsel for the respondent no.1-
</p>
<p id="p_300"> complainants, on the other hand, while supporting the impugned

 orders, submitted that both the Courts         rightly exercised discretion

 while granting interim relief in the complaints. According to him, as

 per the interim orders passed, the Market Committee was merely

 directed to provide work to the complainants which they were

 performing earlier during pendency of the complaints. According to

 him, this was the minimum relief to which the complainants were

 entitled considering the prima facie case made out.          It was submitted

 that in Writ Petition No. 5121 of 2006, this Court had held that the

 Model Standing Orders framed under the Act of 1946 were applicable

 and even though there was a challenge to that judgment, it was only

 the effect of the final order that was stayed by the Hon'ble Supreme

 Court.      It was further submitted that there was no question of the

 provisions of <a href="/doc/1418464/" id="a_12">Section 2</a> (oo) (bb) of the Act of 1947 becoming

 applicable. The posts held by the complainants were sanctioned and

 were vacant. Work was available and despite that, temporary orders

 of appointment were being given. The provisions of <a href="/doc/1056316/" id="a_13">Sections 25F</a> and

 <a href="/doc/41851/" id="a_14">25G</a> of the Act of 1947 were not complied with. To substantiate his

 contention that work was available with the Market Committee, he

 referred to the affidavit filed by the complainant in Writ Petition No.

 3253 of 2017.            As per that affidavit, the Market Committee had




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_83">::: Uploaded on - 27/04/2018                    ::: Downloaded on - 28/04/2018 01:37:45 :::</span>

 engaged other persons to do the same work which the complainants

 were doing earlier. Thus, instead of complying with the interim orders,

 the Market Committee intended to appoint other persons again in a

 temporary manner. He also referred to the rejoinder filed on behalf of

 the petitioner in Writ Petition No. 3220 of 2017 and submitted that the

 Market Committee intended to outsource the work which was being

 done by the complainants. According to him, the direction as issued

 did not cause any prejudice to the Market Committee as               work was

 available.      He, thus, submitted that in absence of any jurisdictional

 error, no case was made out to interfere with the interim order passed

 by the Industrial Court.      In support of his submissions, the learned

 counsel placed reliance on the decisions in [1] Anna Pandurang

 Vaidya, since deceased, through L.Rs. &amp; others Vs. Nagpur

 Agricultural Produce Market Committee through its Chairman

 &amp; others [ 2009 II CLR 880], [2] Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking

 and 2-B, submitted that said respondents had been joined as per

 directions issued by this Court.     It was for the Market Committee to

 substantiate its contentions as to why the impugned orders were liable

 to be set aside.
</p>


<p id="p_303"> 09.            I have heard the learned counsel for the parties at length

 and I have given due consideration to the respective submissions.
</p>


<p id="p_304"> 10.            It is to be noted that what is under challenge is an

 interlocutory order passed by the Labour Court and upheld by the

 Industrial Court during pendency of the complaints filed by the

 workmen.           The impugned orders granting interim relief would,

 therefore, have to be examined on that premise, especially when the

 parties are yet to lead their evidence and substantiate their respective

 contentions.
</p>


<p id="p_305"> 11.            The material on record placed by the complainants is in the

 form of various appointment orders that have been issued by the

 Market Committee since the year 2014 for periods ranging upto six

 months at a time. After giving temporary breaks, complainants have

 been again continued on the same posts. It has come on record that

 there are about 238 sanctioned posts with the Market Committee, out

 of which 128 posts are vacant and 110 posts have been filled in. It is

 also a matter of record that the Director of Marketing has from time to

 time granted permission to fill in the posts on temporary basis and as

 per communication dated 01st April, 2017 while considering a similar

 proposal for granting permission to appoint sixty employees on daily

 wages, a query has been made by the Director of Marketing, Pune, as

 to why it was necessary to engage employees on daily wages, instead

 of recruiting them on a permanent basis. It is, thus, clear that there

 are posts vacant with the Market Committee and as work is also

 available,      the    Market   Committee   has   been      making       temporary

 arrangements by engaging employees on daily wages for periods

 ranging upto six months. The fact that work is also available is further

 substantiated by the affidavits filed by the respondents-complainants

 in Writ Petition Nos. 3220 of 2017 and 3225 of 2017. Further, in the

 affidavit filed on behalf of the Secretary of the Market Committee

 dated 10th April, 2018, it has been stated that the Market Committee

 is considering the aspect of outsourcing various operations through

 third parties and that steps are being contemplated in that regard. Be

 that as it may, as of today, the record indicates that the number of

 sanctioned posts has not been reduced and about 128 posts are still

 vacant.
</p>


<p id="p_306"> 12.            When the issue in hand is viewed in the aforesaid context, it

 can be seen that it is the case of the complainants that having been

 engaged since the year 2014 on temporary basis for a period of almost

 three years. A prima facie finding has been recorded that the

 complainants have put in more than 240 days' service and the

 provisions of <a href="/doc/1056316/" id="a_15">Sections 25F</a> and <a href="/doc/41851/" id="a_16">25G</a> of the Act 1947 are not shown to

 have been complied with. The Market Committee seeks to justify such

 temporary engagement on the ground that necessary permissions are

 granted by the Director of Marketing only for a limited period. At this

 stage, the only direction issued by the Labour Court is to provide work

 to the complainants as they were performing till 1st March, 2017.                 In

 other words, the Market Committee has been merely directed to

 continue to provide work to the complainants as before. The posts in

 question are that of Senior Clerks, Junior Clerks, Gatemen/Peons. In

 the light of the material placed by the complainants before the

 Industrial Court as well as before this Court, I find that the interim

 direction issued by the Labour Court and confirmed by the Industrial

 Court is justified not warranting any interference in exercise of writ

 jurisdiction.

</p><p id="p_308"> 13.            As regards the various decisions relied upon by both sides in

 support of their respective contentions, I find that at this stage, it is

 not necessary to express any opinion on the same in the light of the

 facts noted herein above. Whether the complainants are entitled for

 the relief of reinstatement or whether by virtue of provisions of <a href="/doc/1418464/" id="a_17">Section

 2</a> (oo) (bb) of the Act of 1947, they are dis-entitled for any final relief,

 is a matter to be finally adjudicated. Similarly, the question as regards

 applicability of the Model Standing Orders under the Act of 1946 is

 pending final adjudication. At this prima facie stage, when it has been

 demonstrated on record that sanctioned posts are vacant, the Market

 Committee is required to carry out its duties by engaging the

 complainants albeit in a temporary manner, that arrangement which

 has been directed to be continued does not deserve to be disturbed.
</p>
<p id="p_309"> The interest of the Market Committee can be protected by observing

 that this interim arrangement would be subject to final adjudication of

 the complaints and merely because Industrial Court has granted

 interim relief would by itself not weigh with the Court while deciding

 the complaints finally. This Court, therefore, refrains from making any

 observations with regard to the applicability of the decisions relied

 upon, especially when they all relate to final adjudication of the

 disputes therein.

</p><p id="p_311"> 14.            I, therefore, find that both the Courts did not commit any

 jurisdictional error by directing the Market Committee to provide work

 to the complainants as before till the complaints are decided on

 merits.     By observing that the interim arrangement would not cause

 prejudice to the Market Committee when the Complaints are finally

 decided and by clarifying that observations made in this order are only

 for considering the present challenge, the Writ Petitions are dismissed

 with no order as to costs. In the facts of the case, the Complaints

 pending before the Labour Court shall be decided expeditiously.

 from today.
