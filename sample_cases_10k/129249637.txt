                     WP (C) No. 36780 of 2009
                   ---------------------------------------------
                 Dated this the 21st day of July, 2011

                                JUDGMENT
</pre>

<p id="p_1">     The petitioner who is one among the neighbors of the 3rd

respondent has filed this writ petition challenging Exhibit P3

order dated 7.12.2009 passed by the Additional District

Magisrate, Kollam whereby he permitted the 2nd respondent

herein to draw electricity line along the southern boundary of

the land belonging to the petitioner and two others for the

purpose of giving electricity connection to the residence of the

3rd respondent. On receipt of the 3rd respondent's application

for electricity connection the officers of the Board took steps to

draw the electricity line in the manner now permitted by the

Additional District Magistrate.              The petitioner objected to it

though two other neighboring owners namely Sri. Joy and

Smt.Jayasree did not object to it. In view of the objection raised

by the petitioner, the 2nd respondent moved the Additional

District Magistrate in terms of <a href="/doc/456692/" id="a_1">section 16(1)</a> of Indian Telegraph

Act, 1885. The Additional District Magistrate there upon issued

notice to the parties.     The petitioner and respondents 2 and 3

appeared. The 2nd respondent stated that the proposal submitted

WP (C) No. 36780 of 2009
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                               2</span>

by the Board is the most feasible and the least expensive. The

petitioner contended that the line can be drawn through the

property of Sri.Raghavan, Sri.Pushkaran and Smt. Sudhamani.

The Additional District Magistrate heard the parties on

29.10.2009 and conducted a local inspection on 3.12.2009.   The

Additional District Magistrate found after inspection, that the

proposal to draw the line along the southern boundary of the

land belonging to the petitioner and two others is the least

expensive, while the alternate proposal suggested by the

petitioner is to draw the line through the properties of three

others which necessarily requires their consent. By the

impugned order, the Additional District Magistrate permitted

the 2nd respondent to draw the line in the manner suggested by

him. Exhibit P3 is under challenge in this writ petition.

</p><p id="p_2">     2. Pursuant to an order passed by this Court, the Advocate

Commissioner appointed by this Court has inspected the locality

and submitted a report along with a sketch.         The Advocate

Commissioner has reported that the 3rd respondent's house is

located deep inside rubber plantations belonging to various

persons and there is no motorable-path way or road access to

WP (C) No. 36780 of 2009
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                   3</span>

her property and that she is using a path way half a meter wide

to reach her house. The Advocate Commissioner has also filed a

sketch which shows that the proposal of the Board is to draw the

line along the southern boundary of the land belonging to the

petitioner and two others. Though the Advocate Commissioner

has suggested an alternate route A-B-C-D-E-F he has reported

that the said route passes through the properties of

Sri.Raghavan, Sri.Pushkaran and Smt. Suddhamani. A reference

to the sketch submitted by the Advocate Commissioner would

show that the alternate proposal suggested by the petitioner is to

draw the line      across    the properties of the aforesaid three

persons. The Advocate Commissioner has also reported that a

11 KV line is passing through the properties of Sri.Pushkaran

and Smt. Suddhamani. It is not disputed that Smt.Jayasree and

Sri.Joy who own the lands lying between the properties of the 3rd

respondent and the petitioner have not objected to the line

being drawn along the southern boundary of their properties.

</p><p id="p_3">      3. It is also not in dispute that the consent of Sri.Raghavan,

Sri.Pushkaran and Smt.Sudhamani must be obtained if the line

is to be drawn through their property in the manner proposed by

WP (C) No. 36780 of 2009
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                 4</span>

the petitioner. Naturally there will be objection from the said

persons also. It is thus evident from the materials on record that

the present proposal which was approved        by the Additional

District Magistrate causes the least inconvenience to the

property owners including the petitioner. The petitioner has no

case that the proposed line will pass through or cut across his

property. He does not dispute the fact that the proposal is to

draw the line along the southern boundary of his property.

</p><p id="p_4">     In such circumstances, I am of opinion that the challenge to

Exhibit P3 is without any merit. The Writ Petition fails and is

accordingly dismissed.
