<p id="p_38">6.             In order to establish their claim, the petitioner no. 1 stepped into the
witness box and examined himself as PW1 and has exhibited the following
documents : -
</p><p id="p_39">Ex.PW1/1 - the copy of my driving license,
Ex.PW1/2 - the copy of aadhar card of Smt. Babita Devi,

<p id="p_42">7.             Respondents did not lead any evidence in their defence.
</p>

<p id="p_43">8.     I have thoroughly gone through the testimony of the witnesses and perused
the record. I have also given thoughtful consideration to the arguments addressed
by learned counsel for the parties.

<p id="p_44">My findings on aforesaid issues are as under :-
</p>

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">ISSUE NO. 3</span>
<p id="p_45">(Whether this court has territorial jurisdiction to try the present case? OPP)


</p><p id="p_46">9.             This issue was framed on the preliminary objections taken by the
Insurance company in its WS.            It is argued by ld. Counsel for the Insurance
company that this court has no jurisdiction to try the present petition as the accident


New MACT Case No. 56891-16 Sudheer &amp; Ors Vs Ram Kumar Yadav &amp; Ors                Page No. 5/14
 took place at U.P. and owner and driver are also residing out of Delhi. It is further
argued that the Insurance policy was issued from Ajmer Rajasthan and the present
petition is liable to be dismissed.
</p>

<p id="p_47">               On the other hand, Ld. Counsel for complainant argued that this court
has territorial jurisdiction to try the present petition as the petitioners are resident of
Pratap Nagar, which is well within the jurisdiction of this court and in support, the
petitioners have placed on record the copy of aadhar cards and the copy of driving
license of the father of the deceased namely Sudheer (petitioner no.1) and the
date of issuance of DL is 01.10.2015, which is prior to the accident.
</p>

<p id="p_48">               As per <a href="/doc/136948773/" id="a_4">section 166</a> of the Motor Vehicle Act, the petitioner can claim
compensation within the local limits of whose jurisdiction the accident has taken
place or within the local limits of whose jurisdiction, the claimant resides or carry on
business or within the local limits of whose jurisdiction, the defendant resides. As
per the documents placed on record by the petitioners, it is clear that the petitioners
are resident of Pratap Nagar, Gulabi Bagh, Delhi, which is within the local limits of
the jurisdiction of this court and this court has territorial jurisdiction to try the present
petition.
</p>

<p id="p_49">10.            Hence, Issue No. 3 is thus decided in favour of the petitioners
and against the respondents.
</p>

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">ISSUE NO. 1</span>
<p id="p_50">11.            The present petition is under Section 166 &amp; 140 of M V Act and as
such, it was the duty of the petitioner to prove that the respondent No.1 was rash
and negligent in driving the vehicle at the time of accident.
</p>

<p id="p_51">12.            The petitioners have filed the certified copy of FIR bearing no. 24/16

New MACT Case No. 56891-16 Sudheer &amp; Ors Vs Ram Kumar Yadav &amp; Ors          Page No. 6/14
 u/s 279/304A/427 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_5">IPC</a> PS Bisrakh, Dadri, Gautam Budh Nagar, U.P., including
chargesheet.
</p>

<p id="p_52">13.            The petitioner has explained the mode and manner of the accident in
his affidavit Ex. PW1/A stating that on 25.01.2016, his son namely Rakesh @ Gulo
was returning to his house after visiting Sai Temple.        When he i.e. deceased
Rakesh reached at Crossing namely Khajur Ka Ped in front of Shiv Shakti Dharam
Kanta, one Truck bearing registration no. RJ-51GA-2265 came there being driven
by respondent no. 1 in a rash and negligent manner and hit deceased Rakesh @
Golu. In the accident, deceased Rakesh @ Golu received grievous injuries and he
was taken to MMG Hospital, where doctors declared him brought dead.
</p><p id="p_53">               Eye witness Satvir Singh appeared in the witness box as PW2 and
deposed that on 25.01.2016 at about 4:30 pm, Rakesh @ Gulo was returning from
a Temple and he was riding his bicycle in the service lane in front of Shiv Shakti
Dharam Kanta @ City Dharamkanta, PS Bisrak, Dadri, U.P. Suddenly, a Truck /
Tiller bearing registration no. RJ-51GA-2265 came in a high speed &amp; without
blowing any horn / indicator after crossing Nala towards Service Lane, hit the
deceased Rakesh with great force. Due to the impact, deceased Rakesh fell down
on the road and received fatal injuries.
</p><p id="p_54">               This witness was cross-examined at length, but nothing fruitful came
out for respondents.
</p>

<p id="p_55">14.            It is pertinent to note that the respondent no.1/driver of aforesaid,
Truck, was the other material witness to throw light by testifying as to how and
under what circumstances, the accident had taken place. However, he has
preferred not to enter into the witness box during the course of inquiry. Thus, an
adverse inference is liable to be drawn against him to the effect that the accident in
question occurred due to rash and negligent driving of Truck bearing registration
No. RJ-51GA-2265. The insurance company has not led any evidence on this

New MACT Case No. 56891-16 Sudheer &amp; Ors Vs Ram Kumar Yadav &amp; Ors    Page No. 7/14
 aspect.
</p>

<p id="p_56">15.           Not only this, the Respondent No. 1 namely Ram Kumar Yadav
(accused in the State case) has been charge sheeted for offences punishable U/s
279/304A/427 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_6">IPC</a> by the investigating agency after arriving at the conclusion on
the basis of investigation carried out by it that the accident in question had occurred
due to rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle i.e. Truck bearing
registration No. RJ-51GA-2265 by him. Same would also point out towards rash
and negligent driving of Truck bearing registration No. RJ-51GA-2265 by
respondent no.1.
</p>

<p id="p_57">16.           While determining the negligence, reliance can be placed upon the
judgment of Hon'ble High Court of Delhi in 2009 ACJ 287, National Insurance
Company Limited Vs. Pushpa Rana wherein the Hon'ble High Court has held that
in case the petitioner files the certified copy of the criminal record showing the
completion of the investigation by the police or the issuance of charge sheet under
<a href="/doc/1270101/" id="a_7">section 279</a>/<a href="/doc/409589/" id="a_8">304</a> A IPC or the certified copy of the FIR in addition to recovery memo
and mechanical inspection report of the offending vehicle, these documents are
sufficient proof to reach at the conclusion that the driver was negligent. It was
further held that the proceedings under the <a href="/doc/785258/" id="a_9">Motor Vehicles Act</a> are not akin to the
proceedings in a civil suit and hence strict rules of evidence are not required to be
followed in this regard. Further, in Kaushnumma Begum and others v/s New
India Assurance Company Limited, 2001 ACJ 421 SC , it was held that the issue
of wrongful act or omission on the part of driver of the motor vehicle involved in the
accident is of secondary importance and mere use or involvement of motor vehicle
in causing bodily injuries or death to a human being or damage to prope


</p><p id="p_58">17.            It is also settled law that the term rashness and negligence has to be
construed lightly while making a decision on a petition for claim for the same as

New MACT Case No. 56891-16 Sudheer &amp; Ors Vs Ram Kumar Yadav &amp; Ors     Page No. 8/14
 compared to the word rashness and negligence as          finds mention in<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_10"> the Indian
Penal Code</a>. This is because the chapter in the <a href="/doc/785258/" id="a_11">Motor Vehicle Act</a> dealing with
compensation is a benevolent legislation and not a penal one.
</p>

<p id="p_59">18.           This aspect has also been considered recently by the Hon'ble High
Court of Delhi in the case titled as United India Insurance Co. Ltd. Vd. Smt.
Rinki @ Rinku &amp; Ors in MAC App. No. 200/2012 decided on 23/07/2012. The
Hon'ble High Court has held as under:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">                 "The Claims Tribunal was conscious of the fact that
                 negligence is a sine qua non to a Petition under
                 <a href="/doc/136948773/" id="a_12">Section 166</a> of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988(the
                 Act). It is also true that the proceedings for grant of
                 compensation under the Act are neither governed by
                 the criminal procedures nor are a civil suit. A
                 reference may be made to a judgment of the
                 Supreme Court Bimla Devi and Ors. V Himachal
                 Road Transport Corporation and Ors, (2009) 13
                 SC 530 wherein it was held as under:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">                 "15. In a situation of this nature, the Tribunal has
                 rightly taken a holistic view of the matter. It was
                 necessary to be borne in mind that strict proof of
                 any accident caused by a particular bus in a
                 particular manner may not be possible to be done
                 by the claimant. The claimants were merely to
                 establish their case on the touchstone of
                 preponderance of probability. The standard of proof
                 beyond reasonable doubt could not have been
                 applied."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_60">19.           Therefore, after considering all the documents filed by the petitioner
as a whole, it is clear that respondent no. 1 was driving the vehicle in a rash and
negligent manner.
</p>

<p id="p_61">20.           The issue no. 1, therefore, is decided in favour of the petitioner
and against the respondents.

</p><p id="p_63">(ii)   Whether the petitioners are entitled to compensation, if so, at what
amount and from whom? OPP.
</p>

<p id="p_64">21.              As per the certified copy of postmortem report, the minor
deceased was around 11 years of age at the time of accident.
</p>

<p id="p_65">22.           In the case of a minor, the compensation is to be computed as
prescribed by the Hon'ble High court of Delhi vide judgment dated 13.05.2016 in
MAC Appeal No. 554/2010 titled as <a href="/doc/96711349/" id="a_13">Chetan Malhotra vs. Lala Ram</a>.
</p>

<p id="p_66">23.           Accordingly, in terms of the said orders, the notional income of
the minor has to be computed as Rs.15,000/- X 1081 (Cost Inflation Index for
the financial year in which the accident occurred) / 331 (CII for the base year
1997-1998), which comes to Rs. 48,987.91/-.
</p>

<p id="p_67">24.           By virtue of para no. 71 (iv) of the said judgment, the said notional
income is to be reduced by 2/3rd after deducting 1/3 towards personal and living
expenses of the deceased and the remainder has to be treated as annual loss to
the estate, which comes to Rs. 32,658.61/- (Rs. 48,987.91/- Less Rs. 16,329.30/-
i.e. 1/3rd of Rs. 48,987.91/-).
</p>

<p id="p_68">25.           Furthermore, by virtue of para no. 71(vi) of the said judgment, the age
of the deceased being 11 years, the multiplier of 15 has to be adopted (which has
been prescribed for the age group of more than 10 years upto 15 years in the said
judgment).
</p>

<p id="p_69">26.           Accordingly, the total lost of the estate comes to Rs.4,89,879.15/-
= (Rs.32,658.61/- X 15). (Same is rounded off to Rs. 4,89,880/-).

equal to loss of estate i.e. Rs. 4,89,880/- is added towards non pecuniary
damages.
</p>

<p id="p_72">28.           Accordingly, the total compensation comes to Rs. 9,79,760/- (Rupees
Nine Lakhs Seventy Nine Thousand Seven Hundred Sixty Only). Upon the
said amount, the interest @ 9% per annum is also awarded from the date of filing
of the petition w.e.f. 28.04.2016.      The amount of interim award, if any, shall
however, be deduced from the above amount, if the same has already been paid to
the petitioners.
