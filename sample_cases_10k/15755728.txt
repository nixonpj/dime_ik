                                     ....

07/13.05.2015</pre><p id="p_1">        Heard Mr. Nand Kishore Prasad Sinha, learned counsel
                appearing on behalf of the petitioner and Mr. Kausatav Panda,
                learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent- BCCL.
</p><p id="p_2">                     The petitioner admittedly is second wife of late Rambrix
                Ram, a Timber Mazdoor working in Basanti Mata Colliery under
                the respondent -BCCL, died in harness on 30.11.2006. She
                claims that she married deceased employee in the year 1994
                after the death of his first wife namely Subhawati Devi            on
                20.03.1990. It is not in dispute that there are offspring borne
                out from both the wedlock. In the present case, she claims
                compassionate appointment in lieu of the deceased employee.
                However, according to her though she made application on
                14.06.2008 and 16.07.2008, Annexure-6 and 7 respectively, her
                case was not being considered.
</p><p id="p_3">                     The respondents through their counter affidavit have
                stated at para-11 that till date the petitioner has not applied in
                proper   format   along       with   all   necessary   documents   for
                processing the claim. It is further stated that she only filed plain
                paper application in spite of direction to submit necessary
                documents including No Objection Certificate from all the
                family members as are required. It is also stated that one
                Govind Kumar son borne out of first wife had also made an
                application for compassionate appointment, which was received
                in the colliery on 21.01.2008. The petitioner informed the
                colliery on 28.05.2008 that she is legal heir of the deceased
 employee     and she had not submitted any No Objection
Certificate or affidavit for employment of Gobind Kumar and
therefore, his request should be cancelled. Thereafter the
application of Gobind Kumar was not entertained and he was
accordingly, informed vide letter dated             31.07.2008. The
respondents also admit that claim of CMPF, Gratuity and LCS
has been paid to the present petitioner by cheque. However,
there are serious dispute between the petitioner and Gobind
Kumar in respect of compassionate appointment. It is also
stated at para-23 of the counter affidavit that Rashtriya Colliery
Mazdoor Sangh vide its letter dated 23.11.2012 has informed
the General Manager, Chanch Victoria Area-12, BCCL that Akali
Devi had already remarried Rajdhari Ram of village and PO-
Chatego, District-Azamgarh. A letter with some documents is
also sent to the BCCL, which is annexed as Anenxure-A. Lastly
it is submitted by the respondents that no application from the
petitioner in prescribed format along with necessary documents
has been received seeking compassionate appointment though
she was instructed on several occasions. Since there are
disputed issue between the parties, the writ petition is not
maintainable.
</p><p id="p_4">     Having considered the rival submissions of the parties and
in the background of the factual relevant details, it appears that
the petitioner has actually never applied in the prescribed
format with all necessary documents including No Objection
Certificate from the concerned dependent of the deceased
employee, who left behind offspring from both marriages. The
respondents in their counter affidavit have indicated that
despite instructions, the present petitioner has not applied in
proper format, which is necessary for processing the claim.
</p><p id="p_5">     In such circumstances, no determination of claim can be
made herein also as the said son Gobind Kumar is also not a
party in the writ petition. However, in view of the stand taken
by the respondents, the petitioner is at liberty to approach the
respondent      for   staking   her   claim   for     compassionate
appointment by filing an application in prescribed format with
all necessary documents, affidavit and NOC etc. It is for the
respondent to enquire into the whole matter after also taking
into account whether other dependents have given consent of
her employment and whether she has actually remarried after
            the death of the employee in harness or not.
</p><p id="p_6">                Needless   to   say,   if   the   petitioner   makes   such   an
           application, the same would be considered in accordance with
           law, circulars and the relevant conditions of the NCWA in
           vogue.
</p><p id="p_7">                The writ petition stands disposed of accordingly.
</p>
