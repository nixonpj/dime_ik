Harish Tandon, J. :



</pre><p id="p_8">      The order no. 61 dated December 19, 2014 passed by the learned

Civil Judge (Junior Division), First Court, Alipore in Title Suit No. 2132 of
 2007 rejecting an application under Order 7 Rule 11 of the Code is

assailed in this revisional application.
</p>
<p id="p_9">

</p><p id="p_10">      The plaintiffs/opposite parties filed the aforesaid title suit for

declaration that the Annual General Meeting (AGM) held on 31st August,

2007 be declared, illegal, void and not binding being in violation of Article

of association of the club. The following reliefs are claimed in the plaint:



</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">      "The plaintiff, therefore, prays for a decree against the defendant
      Club:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">      a) for a declaration that the aforesaid Annual General Meeting
         held on 31.08.2007 and the decisions taken therein are illegal,
         invalid and void;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">      b) for a declaration that the Extraordinary General Meeting
         proposed to be held on 28.12.2007 is illegal, invalid and void;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">      c) for permanent injunction restraining the defendant Club from
         alienating any land in its possession for establishing a Hotel."
</blockquote>



<blockquote id="blockquote_5">      The fact emerged from the plaint are adumbrated herein below:
</blockquote>


<blockquote id="blockquote_6">            (a) The defendant/petitioner is a Company and registered

                with the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_1">Companies Act</a>, 1956 having 3100 members.

                The main object is to promote and develop a sport known

                as Golf.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_7">            (b) The    plaintiff   is   a   permanent     member     of   the

                defendant/petitioner-club since 1985.</blockquote>

   the memorandum and article of association. In course of

   the AGM, a fresh agenda was circulated which is in gross

   violation of <a href="/doc/950729/" id="a_3">Article 57</a> of the memorandum and article of

   association and any decision thereon is illegal and bad.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_11">(d) Subsequently a circular dated 08.09.2007 was circulated

   amongst the members of the said club detailing the

   salient points discussed in passed in an AGM held on

   31st August, 2007. Apart from the appointment of the

   Committee for the year 2007/2008, a further resolution

   was passed by majority of show of hands authorizing the

   captain to negotiate the long term lease of the land for

   the hotel project.
</p>
<p id="p_12">(e) A further notice was issued on 1st December, 2007 for

   holding an extraordinary general meeting of the members

   on 28 December, 2007 to pass both ordinary and special

   resolutions which includes the authorizing of the captain

   of the club to negotiate and finalize an agreement with

   the appropriate party/parties for establishing a hotel

   project at 6.1 acres of plot of land (located north east of

   3rd fairway, opposite to TV tower) of the club's property

   on any basis, other than out right sale of the property.
</p><p id="p_13">             (f) The aforesaid resolution is contrary to the object and

                purposes for which the club is established indicated in

                memorandum thereof. In the backdrop of the aforesaid

                facts narrated in the plaint, the above mentioned reliefs

                are claimed.
</p>
<p id="p_14">

      An application for temporary injunction was taken out on the basis

of the aforesaid facts praying almost the identical relief as claimed in the

plaint to restrain the defendant/petitioner from giving effect to the

impugned resolution and also from alienating and/or encumbering any

land of the club for establishing a hotel. Both the Courts rejected the

application for temporary injunction and the matter ultimately reached

before this Court in C.O. No. 3317 of 2009. The order disposing of the

said revisional application reveals that the Trial Court rejected the

application for temporary injunction as the suit is not maintainable

because of the embargo created under Section 10 GB of the Companies

Act. Though the Appellate Court did not approve the finding of the Trial

Court on maintainability of the suit but affirmed the ultimate decision as

the majority members have unanimously decided to go ahead with the

hotel project and, therefore, at the instance of the plaintiff, injunction

should not be passed. Before this Court, the defendant/petitioner fairly

conceded that there was no bar in maintaining the suit but defended the

ultimate decision of both the Courts below by which the application for
 temporary injunction was rejected. In course of the hearing, the

defendant/petitioner pointed out that clause 3 (g) of the memorandum of

association   empowered     the   defendant/company     to   sale,   improve,

manage, develop, lease, mortgage, dispose of or other wise deal with all

or any of the property of the Company and, therefore, the decision to go

ahead with the hotel project could not be in contravention to the object

and purpose of the petitioner club. The Co-ordinate Bench observed that

though the power to sale or deal with the property of the club is present

in the memorandum of association but the same cannot be exercised in

total disregard to the ultimate object for which the claim is formed.

Ultimately the revisional application was disposed of restraining the

defendant/petitioner to maintain status quo with regard to alienation of

the suit property till the disposal of the suit.
</p>
<p id="p_15">

</p><p id="p_16">      Though the Court further requested the Trial Court to dispose of

the suit expeditiously, the defendant/petitioner was advised to proceed

under Order 7 Rule 11 of the Code seeking rejection of the plaint. The

prayer for rejection of plaint is based on the facts that once the High

Court in revisional application held that the petitioner club had a right to

sale and/or dispose of any part of its property and the club was not

trying to allowing any land in its possession for hotel project, the suit has

become infractuous. It is further stated that the challenge is made to an

AGM dated 31st August, 2007 only when three subsequent AGMs were
 held   adopting   the   resolutions   and,   therefore,   the   suit   is   not

maintainable. Lastly the rejection of plaint is sought as the suit is barred

under the <a href="/doc/1671917/" id="a_4">Specific Relief Act</a> as well as the Company Law and the

plaintiffs has no cause of action to suit.
</p>
<p id="p_17">

</p><p id="p_18">       The Trial Court rejected the said application as the grounds on

which the rejection is sought requires determination after full-fledged

trial and further held that the plaint cannot be rejected under Order 7

Rule 11 of the Code.
</p>
<p id="p_19">

</p><p id="p_20">       Mr. Mitra, the learned Senior Advocate for the petitioner confined

his argument before this Court on other points than the plea of bar

under <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_5">Section 10GB</a> of the Companies Act. Firstly, he attacks the

impugned order that an individual member/shareholder of the petitioner

company cannot maintain the suit as it is not a derivative action in

absence of any leave under Order 1 Rule 8 of the Code. He submits that

the plaint does not disclose any personal or individual cause of action

against the petitioner company and, therefore, the plaint is bereft of any

cause of action. To buttress the aforesaid submission, the reliance is

placed upon a Division Bench judgment of this Court in case of Asansol

Electric Supply Co. and Ors; -v- Chunilal Daw &amp; Ors; reported in 75

CWN 704, Jhajharia Bros. Ltd. -v- Sholapoor Spinning &amp; Weaving Co.

Ltd. reported in AIR 1941 Cal 174.
</p><p id="p_21">       Secondly, he submits that the suit has become infructuous in

view of the subsequent events as three subsequent AGMs of 2008, 2009

&amp; 2010 have been held and the resolutions have been passed and,

therefore, the plaint should be rejected. In support of the aforesaid

contention, the reliance is placed on the judgment of the Supreme Court

in case of Shipping Corporation of India Ltd. -v- Machado Brothers &amp;

Others; reported in (2004) 11 SCC 168.
</p>
<p id="p_22">

</p><p id="p_23">      Thirdly it is submitted that though some of the clauses from

memorandum and article of association are incorporated in the plaint

but the relevant clause which permits the power of the club to sale,

alienate, mortgage or deal with any of its property has been suppressed.

He further submits that the Court can look into the document produced

for the first time by the defendant if the reference whereof can be traced

from the plaint for the purpose of rejection of plaint under Order 7 Rule

11 of the Code. He says that if the document is not appended and/or

disclosed in the list of documents required at the time of presentation of

plaint, the Court shall look into the said document produced for the first

time by the defendant under Order 7 Rule 11 of the Code if the

foundation of the plaint case is based thereupon and placed reliance

upon a judgment of this Court in case of Punjab National Bank -v-

Britannia Industries Ltd. reported in (2001) 2 Cal LT 219(HC),
 Bhagwan Das -v- Goswami Brijesh Kumarji &amp; Ors; reported in AIR

1983 Raj 3 and in case of SNP Shipping Services Pvt. Ltd. &amp; others; -

v- World Tanker Carrier Corporation &amp; another reported in AIR 2000

Bombay 34. Lastly he submits that the suit which is per se vexatious

and devoid of actual cause of action should be nipped in the bud as held

in case of I.T.C. Limited -v- Debts Recovery Appellate Tribunal &amp;

Others; reported in (1998) 2 SCC 70.
</p>
<p id="p_24">

</p><p id="p_25">      The opposite party refuted the contention of the petitioner saying

that despite the provision of <a href="/doc/146869/" id="a_6">Section 397</a> &amp; <a href="/doc/280790/" id="a_7">398</a> of the Companies Act,

the civil suit is maintainable if the challenge is made to a validity of the

meeting which is per se illegal and placed reliance upon a judgment in

case of Dr, T.M. Paul -v- City Hospital (Pvt.) Ltd. &amp; Others; reported in

97 Company Cases 216 and in case of Ravinder Kumar Jain -v-

Punjab Registered (Iron &amp; Steel) Stockholders Association Ltd.

reported in (1978) 48 Com Cases 401. To counter the submission

relating to derivative action and leave under Order 1 Rule 8 of the Code,

it is submitted that if a personal right of a member is infringed by any

action of the majority, the suit is maintainable as held in case of

National Sports Club of India -v- Nandlal Dwarkadas Chhabria

reported in 1997 (3) BomCR 565. It is vehemently submitted that the

statements which does not appear from the plaint cannot be looked into

except for the limited purposes that it would be a futile exercise to allow
 the suit to continue being vexatious and/or abuse of the process of the

Court as held in case of Bijon Kumar Mallick -v- Associated Builders

Corporation reported in 2015 (2) CHN 434.
</p>
<p id="p_26">

</p><p id="p_27">      It is strenuously submitted that by a resolution dated 31st August,

2007, a decision was taken to encumber and/or deal with the property of

the petitioner club for setting up hotel which is unconnected and/or

unrelated with the object of the club which is primarily to promote the

sports namely Golf.
</p>
<p id="p_28">

</p><p id="p_29">      According to the learned Advocate for the opposite party, an

individual member can challenge the resolution taken in the AGM if it is

violative of memorandum and article of association of the club having

numerous members and the leave under Order 1 Rule 8 of the Code is

not mandatory. Lastly it is submitted that this Court in an earlier

revisional application maintained the order of injunction even after

noticing the clause 3 (g) of the memorandum and article of association

and directed the Trial Court to expedite the suit, the application for

rejection of the plaint based on the said clause is not maintainable.



</p><p id="p_30">      From the submissions of the respective counsels, it is relevant to

narrate the facts from the plaint for the purpose of Order 7 Rule 11 of the

Code. It is a settled proposition of law that the Court shall confine its
 perusal and scrutiny to the averments made in the plaint or the

documents annexed thereto when the rejection is sought on the ground

that the plaint does not disclose cause of action or is barred by law. The

suit as it appears is a simplicitor suit for declaration that the AGM held

on 31st August, 2007 was in violation of the Article of association of the

club and the decision taken therein is illegal, void and not binding being

opposed to clauses 3(a), (d) &amp; (e) of the memorandum and article of

association of the defendant club. The plaint case proceeds that in the

notice for AGM to be held on 31st August, 2007, there was no agenda for

setting up the hotel project which was circulated to the members present

in the said meeting and was thereafter passed by majority by raising of

hands. It is further stated that <a href="/doc/950729/" id="a_8">Article 57</a> of the memorandum and article

of association relatable to the business of the AGM stipulates the election

of captain, committee, appointment and fixation of remuneration of

auditors as ordinary business and the special resolution shall be

transacted only after compliance under <a href="/doc/264447/" id="a_9">Section 173</a> (2) (3) of the

<a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_10">Companies Act</a>. The special resolution being not in conformity with the

said clause is, therefore, bad and is also opposed to the object for which

the club was established.
</p>
<p id="p_31">

</p><p id="p_32">      It is undeniable that the application for temporary injunction was

dismissed by the Trial Court as the Plaintiff/Opposite Party failed to

make out any prima facie case and affirmed by the Court of appeal
 below, on the other point that the suit is otherwise hit under <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_11">Section

10GB</a> of the Companies Act. Before the revisional Court, the defendant-

petitioner conceded that the suit is not hit by the provision of <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_12">Section

10GB</a> of the Companies Act and, therefore, the plea under Order 7 Rule

11 of the Code in this regard cannot be taken as a ground for rejection of

the plaint. A point which was agitated at an earlier point of time in

course of the suit having decided, cannot be allowed to be agitated at the

different stages of the same proceeding. The argument was restricted on

Clause 3(g) of the memorandum and article of association permitting the

club to sale, mortgage and/or deal with all or any of the property of the

Company and, therefore, the resolution in this regard cannot be

impinged. Even after noticing the said clause, the Court held though the

Company prima facie appears to have right to deal with its own property

but the Court cannot ignore the facts that it is in total disregard to the

primary object for which the Company was formed and directed the

Company to maintain status quo with regard to the alienation of the suit

property till the disposal of the suit.
</p>
<p id="p_33">

</p><p id="p_34">      From the meaningful reading of the observations made by this

Court in an earlier revisional application, it appears that though the

power to sale or deal with the property of the Company is conferred in

the memorandum and article of association but the same should be
 inconsonance with the object and purposes for which the Company is

formed.
</p>
<p id="p_35">

</p><p id="p_36">      However, a plea was taken before this Court that since the

memorandum and article of association of the petitioner club is neither

produced at the time of presentation of plaint nor disclosed in the list of

documents appended thereto, the Court shall not look into such

document produced at the instance of the defendant for the purpose of

Order 7 Rule 11 of the Code. The reference in this regard can be made to

a single bench decision of the Rajasthan High Court in case of Bhagwan

Das (supra) wherein it is held:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_9">      " Learned counsel for the opposite party may be right in urging
      that if the plaint is based on a document, then such a document
      may be considered as forming part of the plaint itself and the
      document can also be looked into, while considering the averments
      of the plaint, for the purpose of deciding the question that the
      plaint discloses a cause of action or not. But it has to be
      remembered that the averments made in the plaint as well as the
      contents of the document which may constitute part of the plaint,
      can be looked into on the face value thereof and the question
      relating to the validity or invalidity of the document cannot be
      considered at the stage of deciding an application under

</pre><p id="p_39">            In India under Order 7 Rule 11 the plaint can be rejected
            where it does not disclose a cause of action or where the suit
            appears from the statement made in the plaint to be barred
            by any law. For the purpsoe of deciding that the plaint "does
            not disclose a cause of action", the Courts generally look
            only at the plaint. However, there is a rider to this rule, that
            when the plaint is based on a document, the same can also
            be looked into. This proposition has been recognised by the
            Rajasthan High Court in the case of <a href="/doc/1667086/" id="a_13">Bhagwan Das v.
            Goswami Brijesh Kumarji</a>, (AIR 1983 Rajasthan 3). In

the game of Golf and affording to its members all usual privileges,

advantages, conveniences and accommodation of a golf club. Clause 3(e)

thereof stipulates the lay out and prepare, adopt and improve the lands

for the purpose of playing golf, bowls, or other games or any kind of

athletic sports, amusement or recreations and to construct and/or

demolish any building or erection not so required which may seen

directly or indirectly to the Company's objects. Though the power to sale

incorporated therein but it is to be interpreted harmoniously with the

different clauses of the memorandum and not in isolation thereof.

formed. The decision taken by the majority of the shareholders/members

it is fundamentally against the memorandum and article of association

            Ramkissendas Dhanuka &amp; Ors; v. Satya Charan Law 50
            CWN 310, it has been held that the principle that the Court

            company except at the instance of the majority of the share-
            holders, is applicable only where the act complained of is
            merely irregular and not when it is ultra vires. The decision
            in Dhanuka's case has been approved by the Privy Council
            in an appeal from the decision in that case(See AIR 1950
            Privy Council 80).
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_13">             14. It is now an accepted principle of law that where an act

            the members of the company or its share-holders to ratify

</p><p id="p_52">      The judgment rendered in case of Jhajharia Bros. Ltd. (supra)

relied upon by the petitioner laid down that the suit at the instance of an

individual shareholder of the Company on his behalf and on behalf of

other unspecified shareholders against the Company alleging the fraud

upon the minority may not have been perfectly instituted but carved out

an exception in these words:
</p>
<p id="p_53">

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_14">            "7. I propose, as shortly as I can without going into the
            cases in detail, to explain my understanding of the matter.
            There can of course be suits by shareholders against the
            company for individual wrong done to them. Apart from
            individual wrong there may be suits to restrain acts ultra
            vires. There is no question of ultra vires in this case and I
            propose to confine the discussion to suits other than those
            based upon complaints of acts ultra vires, although I am not
            suggesting that there is any fundamental difference in
            principle. Suit to restrain acts ultra vires and suits to
            restrain certain acts about to be discussed notwithstanding
            that the acts have the support of the majority of
            shareholders, are both exceptions to the rule that the Court
            will not interfere in the affairs of the company or with the
            decision of the majority. The Court interferes in cases of an
                ultra vires act, because it is not an act within the
               constitution. In the other class of cases the Court interferes
               upon a different basis."</blockquote><p id="p_54">




</p><p id="p_55">      The suit at the instance of an individual shareholder, alleging the

infringement of a right for an action and the majority shareholders being

opposed to the memorandum and article of association, cannot be said to

be an imperfect suit liable to fail on the parameters of Order 7 Rule 11 of

the Code. Mere reference of more than 3100 members does not, ipso

facto, raise a presumption that the suit is not maintainable in absence of

any leave under Order 1 Rule 8 of the Code. Section 9 of the Code of Civil

Procedure postulates that the Civil Courts have jurisdiction to try all

suits of civil nature unless there is an express or implied bar. It is no

longer res integra that such exclusion should not be readily inferred and

the rule of construction being that every presumption should be made in

favour of his existence rather than exclusion of the jurisdiction of the

Civil Court.

is of preventive in nature so as to bring an end to oppression and

mismanagement on the part of the controlling shareholders but does not

in express terms take away the power of the Civil Court to declare a

resolution to be ultra vires to the memorandum and article of

association.
</p><p id="p_58">       The subsequent events can be taken note of if the original

proceeding has become infructuous as it would be a futile exercise to

allow such suit to continue. It is based on the legal maxim ex debito

justitiae i.e. it is a duty of the Court to take such action which is

necessary in the interest of Justice. Every facts germinated after the

litigation having a substantial nexus and/or bearing on the relief claimed

in the suit may be taken into consideration for ends of Justice.



</p><p id="p_59">      The reliance can be placed in this regard to a judgment in case of

Shipping Corporation of India Ltd.(supra), it is held:


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_15">      "25. Thus it is clear that by the subsequent event if the
      original proceeding has become infructuous, ex debito
      justitiae, it will be the duty of the court to take such action as
      is necessary in the interest of justice, which includes
      disposing of infructuous litigation. For the said purpose it will
      be open to the parties concerned to make an application
      under Section 151 CPC to bring to the notice of the court the
      facts and circumstances which have made the pending
      litigation infructuous. Of course, when such an application is
      made, the court will enquire into the alleged facts and
      circumstances to find out whether the pending litigation has
      in fact become infructuous or not."</blockquote><p id="p_60">




</p><p id="p_61">      The petitioner-club says that the challenge is made to a resolution

dated 31st August, 2007 when, in fact, the resolution have been adopted
 in a subsequent AGMs which are not a subject-matter of the instant suit.

In all the subsequent AGMs, the resolution adopted in the AGM dated

31st August, 2007 is ratified and confirmed and a consequential steps

and/or the consequential resolution have been taken therein. None of the

resolutions adopted in the subsequent AGM have virtually superseded

and/or withdrawn resolution taken in AGM dated 31st August, 2007. If

the resolution in the subsequent AGM are based upon the parent

resolution taken in the first AGM which is a subject-matter of the suit, it

cannot be said that the suit become infructuous.

infructuous because of the subsequent events.
