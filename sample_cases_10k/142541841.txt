CORAM: HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE RAKESH KUMAR
ORAL JUDGMENT
Date: 02-03-2017

                Heard Sri Ram Shankar Prasad, learned counsel for the

   petitioner, learned A.C. to Govt. Advocate - 13 as well as learned

   counsel for respondent no. 8.
</p>
<p id="p_13">                2. The petitioner has approached this Court invoking its

   writ jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India, with a

   prayer to quash an order dated 04-08-2008 passed in Anganbari

   Appeal No. 4-261 of 2008 passed by the Commissioner, Tirhut
 Patna High Court CWJC No.15476 of 2008 dt.02-03-2017

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                         2/5</span>




        Division,      Muzaffarpur         (hereinafter   referred   to   as   the

        'Commissioner'). By the said order, the learned Commissioner has set

        aside the order passed by the District Officer, Vaishali in Misc. Case

        No. 3 of 2007-08.
</p>
<p id="p_14">                       3. Short fact of the case is that petitioner had

        participated in selection process in respect of appointment of

        Anganbari Sevika in Anganbari Centre No. 71, Dhamauli, Panchayat -

        Dayalpur in the District of Vaishali at Hajipur. Alongwith the

        petitioner, others had also participated including respondent no. 8.

        In the Aam Sabha, considering the fact that respondent no. 8 had

        obtained total 58.42 % of marks, she was selected as Anganbari

        Sevika.
</p>
<p id="p_15">                       4. Aggrieved with the selection of respondent no. 8, as

        Anganbari Sevika, the petitioner raised an objection. Thereafter, a

        case, vide Miscellaneous Case No. 3 of 2007-08 was registered. In the

        said proceeding, several reports were sought for and proceeding

        continued on several dates and finally, by order dated 23-02-2008,

        the learned District Officer cancelled the selection of respondent no.

        8, as Anganbari Sevika, and directed for initiating fresh selection

        process in respect of Anganbari Centre No. 71.

</p><p id="p_16">                       5. Being aggrieved with the order of the learned District
 Patna High Court CWJC No.15476 of 2008 dt.02-03-2017

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                         3/5</span>




        Officer, the respondent no. 8, who had already joined after selection

        as Anganbari Sevika, filed an appeal, in view of provision contained in

        Anganbari       Sevika/Sahayika         Guideline   of   2006,   before   the

        Commissioner and the learned Commissioner by its order dated

        04-08-2008 i.e. Annexure - 6 set aside the order of the District

        Officer and restored the selection of respondent no. 8, as Anganbari

        Sevika, for Anganbari Centre No. 71.
</p>
<p id="p_17">                       6. Learned counsel for the petitioner, assailing the

        selection of respondent no. 8, has primarily argued that in

        considering marks, double standard was adopted by the selection

        authority. It has been argued that percentage of marks was awarded

        to the petitioner after excluding the number of optional subject,

        whereas, the marks obtained in the optional subject by the

        respondent no. 8 was considered for granting marks. He tried to

        persuade the Court that the selection authority has committed

        serious illegality in ignoring the marks of optional paper obtained by

        the petitioner, whereas, the selection authority has accepted the

        marks of optional paper obtained by respondent no. 8. On aforesaid

        ground, a prayer was made to set aside the order of the appellate

        authority.
</p>
<p id="p_18">                       7. Learned State counsel as well as learned counsel for
 Patna High Court CWJC No.15476 of 2008 dt.02-03-2017

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                         4/5</span>




        respondent no. 8 have vehemently opposed the prayer of the

        petitioner. By way of referring to the merit list, which has been

        brought on record vide Annexure 3/i to the present petition, it was

        highlighted by the learned State counsel that marks obtained by both

        the parties were taken into consideration out of total marks of 700.

        So far the petitioner is concerned, in matriculation, out of 700, she

        had got 395 marks, which comes to 56.42%, whereas, respondent no.

        8 had got 374 marks out of 700 and percentage of marks comes to

        53.42%. Learned State counsel has drawn my attention to page 21

        i.e. part of Annexure - 3/i to highlight that besides marks of the

        matriculation, the additional 5 marks was granted to the private

        respondent, since she was intermediate. So, after counting marks of

        matriculation as well as bonus marks granted as intermediate i.e. 5

        additional marks, it comes to 58.42 % and as such, there is no reason

        to entertain the prayer of the petitioner that marks of optional

        subject was not considered in respect of the petitioner. He submits

        that earlier error was committed by the District Officer, which has

        been corrected by the appellate authority i.e. Commissioner by its

        order dated 04-08-2008.
</p>
<p id="p_19">                       8. Besides hearing, I have also perused the materials

        available on record. After going through the materials on record, the
          Patna High Court CWJC No.15476 of 2008 dt.02-03-2017

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                                  5/5</span>




                 Court is satisfied that petitioner was granted 5 (five) bonus marks

                 due to the reason that besides matriculation, she was also

                 Intermediate pass and as such, total marks has rightly been

                 considered by the selection authority.
</p>
<p id="p_20">                                9. In view of facts and circumstances, I do not find any

                 error in the order of the learned Commissioner.

</p><p id="p_21">                                10. The writ petition stands dismissed.</p><pre id="pre_2">



                                                                          (Rakesh Kumar, J.)
