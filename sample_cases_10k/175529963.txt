</p><p id="p_4">1.          This appeal is coming up for final hearing after 20 years of the

fatal accident. The deceased was a housewife. The MACT, Hisar has

assessed monthly income at `1500/- per month in its award dated September

07, 1999. The fatal accident that led to premature death took place on

September 29, 1997. The offending vehicle was a Haryana Roadways bus

and, therefore, State is liable to pay compensation. The petition had been

filed both under <a href="/doc/136948773/" id="a_1">Section 166</a> and <a href="/doc/22871263/" id="a_2">163-A</a> of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. In

the matter of assessment of income of a home maker, the law to be followed

is stated in <a href="/doc/508534/" id="a_3">Lata Wadhwa and others v. State of Bihar and others</a>, (2001) 8

SCC 197 and accordingly the income deserves to be substantially increased

from `1500/- per month. The law is equally well settled in the aforesaid

</p>
<p id="p_5">2.          Learned counsel for the appellant relies on orders in FAO

No.218 of 2014, <a href="/doc/144160225/" id="a_4">United India Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Sube Singh and others</a>

decided on January 15, 2014 &amp; FAO No.2772 of 2015, Tarsem Singh and

others v. M/s New India Assurance Co. Ltd. and others, decided on August

22, 2017 to contend that the income should be increased to `9000/- per

month. The two coordinate Benches have maintained the income at `9000/-

per month. In FAO No.218 of 2014 Brother Ajay Tewari, J. while noticing

Lata Wadhwa's case (Supra) observed as follows:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">                   "Learned counsel for the appellant has
            argued that even while noticing that the income
            of a skilled worker in 2012 was approximately
            `8000/- the Tribunal has wrongly assessed the
            income of the deceased as `9000/-. As per him
            once the notional income had been taken a
            deduction had to be made for personal expenses.</blockquote><p id="p_6">
</p><p id="p_7">            This argument is flawed. <a href="/doc/508534/" id="a_5">In Lata Wadhwa and
            others v. State of Bihar and others</a> reported as
            2001(4) RCR(Civil) 673 (where the accident had
            taken place in 1981) the Hon'ble Supreme Court
            evaluated the contribution of a house wife at
            `3000/-per month. The accident in the present
            case took place after 23 years. In my considered
            opinion to tag a house wife as a 'skilled worker'
            alone does not do complete justice to her
            multifarious role as a home manager. Keeping in
            view the lapse of 23 years between the accident in
            the case of Lata Wadhwa and the present accident
            and my conclusion that a house wife is something

             more than a mere skilled worker it would not be
             unreasonable to estimate the contribution of the
             deceased in the present case at a higher figure.
             On the whole I see no reason for reducing the
             quantum."
</p><p id="p_8">3.           I have every reason to follow this judgment of which I am told

that the SLP against the orders in FAO No.218 of 2014 has been dismissed

so also the SLP in the other case cited by the appellants which has suffered

the same fate in the Supreme Court and, therefore, the orders have attained

finality. Income is accordingly assessed at `9000/- per month without

deduction.

<p id="p_9">4.           Late Smt. Laxmi died in the accident when she was 35 years of

age. The multiplier of 16 has been applied by the Tribunal which is

appropriate. However, the award is of only `1,95,000/- to the three

claimants-dependents i.e. husband and minor children with interest @12%

per annum from February 17, 1998, the date of filing of the petition till

realization. The counsel fee was assessed at `550/-.

             Monthly salary (9000 + 3600)                       =     12600
             Deduction towards personal expenses                =     4200

National Insurance Company Limited v. Pranay Sethi and others</a> to add up

to `70,000/-.
</p>
<p id="p_12">7.           In view of the above discussion, the appeal is partly allowed.

The award is modified. Compensation is enhanced by keeping in view

income @ `9000/- per month as against `1500/- per month awarded by the

Tribunal. For the three conventional heads `70,000/- is awarded as per

Pranay Sethi. Counsel fee is increased to `5500/- from `550/-.

</p><p id="p_13">8.           Accordingly, the total compensation comes out to `16,88,300/-

(`1612800 + `70000 + `5500). If the amount awarded by the Tribunal is

already paid, an amount of `14,93300/- is payable to the claimants.

</p><p id="p_14">9.           The children were minor at the time of death of the mother.

Eighty per cent of the compensation under this order will be divided

between the two minor children and balance 20% would go to the claimant

husband, if he is not remarried, this is in order to protect the interest of the

children and to cater to their education and/or settle them in life. In case,

husband is remarried then children will get 100% of the re-computed

compensation.
</p>
<p id="p_15">10.          Interest is maintained at the rate awarded by the Tribunal in its

discretion. The amount calculated under this order will be deposited in the

Executing Court/Tribunal within six weeks from the date of receipt of

certified copy of this order and the same be disbursed to the claimants

without delay. If the amount is in default of deposit, then the payable sum

would carry interest @ 12% per annum till realisation.
