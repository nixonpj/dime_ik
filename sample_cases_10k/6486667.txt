<p id="p_3"> 1.       Heard learned APP and learned counsel for the respondents.
</p>

<p id="p_4"> 2.       Perused the record and proceeding.
</p>

<p id="p_5"> 3.       This is a case of custodial death.            The deceased, who
 happens to be the wife of respondent no. 1, has committed suicide
 in her matrimonial house within one and half years of her
 marriage. She was carrying pregnancy of 10 weeks. It is held that
 she has committed suicide. The nature of ligature and the injuries
 marked in the PM notes are in the nature of parchment about 14
 cm in length and 1 cm in breadth.             It is pertinent to note that
 there is no explanation by accused under <a href="/doc/697566/" id="a_1">section 106</a> of the Indian
 Evidence Act.

 consonance with the First Information Report and has stated that
 4 months after marriage, accused had attempted to set the victim
 on fire by pouring kerosene on her person. At that time, the victim
 managed to escape and run away from the house.                            There is
 allegation that there was demand of Rs. 1,00,000/- and 5 tolas
 gold     and      the    victim   was   being   harassed      for    demand         of
 Rs. 1,00,000/-. She was made to starve by the members of the
 family. Father of the victim has specifically stated that he had no
 knowledge that deceased was pregnant at the time of the incident.
 Sister of the victim has deposed before the Court that deceased
 had informed her that at the time of setting her on fire, accused
 no. 2 was saying that their elder daughter in law was set on fire by
 them in the same manner. The doctor has opined that from the
 observations in column no. 17, it appears that it is case of suicidal
 death. Although the deceased has died within one and half years
 of marriage that too when she was pregnant, The learned Sessions
 Judge has failed to raise the presumption under <a href="/doc/1906/" id="a_2">Section 113B</a> of
 the Indian Evidence Act.

<p id="p_7"> 5.       In view of this, the appeal deserves to be admitted only
 against respondents no. 1, 2 and 3. Application seeking leave to
 appeal is rejected as far as respondents no. 4, 5 and 6 are
 concerned. Leave granted. Hence,
