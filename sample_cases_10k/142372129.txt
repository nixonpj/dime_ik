Shri Manoj Saxena, learned counsel for the

Shri Sanjay Karanjiwala, learned Public Prosecutor
for the respondent-State.</pre>
<p id="p_1">This is an application under <a href="/doc/1290514/" id="a_1">Section 439</a> Cr.P.C. by
petitioner â Satish, who has been arrested by
police on 08.04.2017 in Crime No.140/2017 of
Police Station â Shujalpur, Distt. Shajapur
concerning offences under <a href="/doc/1258372/" id="a_2">Section 147</a>, <a href="/doc/999134/" id="a_3">149</a>, <a href="/doc/222396/" id="a_4">427</a>,
<a href="/doc/838469/" id="a_5">452</a>, <a href="/doc/1552733/" id="a_6">435</a> and <a href="/doc/1517318/" id="a_7">436</a> of IPC.
</p><p id="p_2">Heard the learned counsel for the parties and
perused the case diary.
</p><p id="p_3">Allegedly, on 07.04.2017, a mob comprising of male
and female persons opposing shifting of liquor shop
by complainant Bana Singh in the locality entered
into the shop and set on fire 150 cartoons of country
made liquor. Apart that 5 gunny bags of wheat, 5
gunny bags of garlic, one LCD and 10 plywoods were
also taken out of the shop and put to fire. The further
allegation is that the persons present in the mob
hurled abuses upon salesman Dayashankar Dubey
and Rajbihari, who have informed about the incident
to complainant Bana Singh. As per First Information
Report lodged by Bana Singh, applicant was also
present in the mob and he also took part in causing
mischief by fire.
</p><p id="p_4"> It is submitted by the learned counsel for the
petitioner that the petitioner is in custody since
08.04.2017. It is further submitted that the
investigation is over and the charge-sheet has been
filed before the Competent Magistrate and the trial is
likely to take long time. It is further submitted that
the offence is triable by Judicial Magistrate First
Class and that no specific overt act has been ascribed
to the present applicant in the First Information
Report.
</p><p id="p_5">Though prayer for bail is opposed by the learned
counsel for the respondent/State, however,
considering the aforesaid, so also the nature of
allegations made against the petitioner and the
quality of material to support the same, it would be
appropriate to enlarge the petitioner on bail.
Accordingly, the petition is hereby allowed and it is
directed that on furnishing personal bond in the sum
of Rs.40,000/- with one solvent surety in the like
amount to the satisfaction of the concerned Chief
Judicial Magistrate/Judicial Magistrate First Class,
the petitioner shall be released on bail, subject to the
condition that he will make himself available to the
Police, as and when required, in the course of
investigation and will also remain present before the
trial Court as and when directed in that behalf.
CC as per rules.
