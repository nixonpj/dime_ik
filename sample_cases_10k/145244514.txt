<p id="p_1">               The    Constitutional      philosophy      completely      eradicates

discrimination on the grounds of casts, creed, religion, domicile etc. It has

propounded the equality and freedom. But after a lapse of 68 years since

after coming into force of the Constitution of India, the citizens, especially

in the ruralities, are under the influence of orthodox phenomina and believe

in the traditional societies. It gravely affects the doctrine of social justice

and equality

           The social values in ancient society had propounded freedom,

liberty and equality but the shackles of millennium long slavery made the

society complexened one and it resulted into the darkest aspect of castism.

Anr." Reported as 2006 (5) SCC 475; has observed in para No.17 &amp; 18 as

<p id="p_2">             "17.   The caste system is a curse on the nation and the sooner it is
             destroyed the better. In fact, it is dividing the nation at a time when
             we have to be united to face the challenges before the nation
             unitedly. Hence, inter-caste marriages are in fact in the national
             interest as they will result in destroying the caste system. However,
             disturbing news are coming from several parts of the country that
             young men and women who undergo inter caste marriage, are
             threatened with violence, or violence is actually committed on
             them. In our opinion, such acts of violence or threats or harassment
             are wholly illegal and those who commit them must be severally
             punished. This is a free and democratic country, and once a person
             becomes a major he or she can marry whosoever he / she likes. If
             the parents of the boy or girl do not approve of such inter caste or
             inter-religious marriage the maximum they can do is that they can
             cut off social relations with the son or the daughter, but they
             cannot give threats or commit or instigate acts of violence and
             cannot harass the person who undergoes such inter-caste or inter-
             religious marriage. We, therefore, direct that the administration /
             police authorities throughout the country will see to it that if
             anybody or girl who is major undergoes inter-caste or inter-
             religious marriage with a women or man who is a major, the
             couple are not harassed by anyone nor subjected to threats or acts
             of violence, anyone who gives such threats or harasses or commits
             acts of violence either himself or at his instigation, is taken to task
             by instituting criminal proceedings by the police against such
             persons and further stern action is taken against such person as
             provided by law.
</p><p id="p_3">             18.    We sometimes hear of 'honour' killings of such persons
             who undergo intercaste or interreligious marriage of their own free
             will. There is nothing honourable in such killings, and in fact they
             are nothing but were barbaric and shameful acts of murder
             committed by brutal, feudal minded persons who deserve harsh
             punishment. Only in this way can we stamp out such acts of
             barbarism."

together but they apprehend danger to their life, limb and liberty from the

hands of private respondents.
</p>
<p id="p_5">             Being the citizens of independent India, both of them have right

to reside with honour and dignity. Therefore, they have sought the

protection from the hands of private respondents and they also sought

direction to remaining respondents to provide them protection.

</p><p id="p_6">             <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1">Article 21</a> of The Constitution of India guarantees the protection

of their lives but the private respondents No.4 to 16, are posing threats and

danger to their life, limb and liberty. To the mind of this court, the

petitioners have every right to seek the protection of their life, limb and

liberty.

<p id="p_7">             This Court in "Pardeep Kumar Singh versus State of

Haryana" - 2008(3) RCR (Criminal) 376 (P&amp;H) had made the following

observations with regard to run away couples:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">           "i)       Whenever any intimation is received by the SSP/SP of
           concerned District regarding the marriage of a young couple with a
           threat and an apprehension of infringement of the right of life and
           liberty by the police at the instance of the family members of one of the
           spouses, the SSP/SP concerned will consider the representation and
           will himself/herself look into the matter and issue necessary directions
           to maintain a record of the said intimation under Chapter 21 of the
           Punjab Police Rules.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">           ii)       On receipt of abovesaid intimation of marriage by any police
           officer, necessary directions will be issued to the concerned Police
           Station to take necessary steps in accordance with law to enquire into
           the matter by contacting the parents of both and girl- The matter
           regarding age, consent of the girl and grievance of her family will be
           determined-In the eventuality of any complaint of kidnapping or
           abduction having been received from any of the family members of the
           girl generally the boy (husband) will not be arrested unless the until the
           prejudicial statement is given by the girl (wife) - Arrest should
           generally be deferred or avoided on the immediate receipt of a
           complaint by the parents or family, members of the girl taking into

          consideration the law laid down by Hon'ble Supreme Court in
          Joginder Kumar's case (supra);
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">         iii)              If the girl is major (above 18 years), she should not
         forcibly be taken away by police to be handed over to her parents
         against her consent- Criminal force against the boy should also be
         avoided.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">         iv)            So far as the threat to the young couple of the criminal
         force and assault at the hands of the private persons is concerned, it
         would always be open to the police to initiate action if any substantive
         offence is found to have been committed against the couple;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">         v)             In case of any threat to the breach of the peace at the
         hands of the family members of the couple it will always be open to the
         State authorities to take up the security proceedings in accordance with
         law;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_6">         vi)        It will not be open to the "run away couple" to take law in their
         hands pursuant to the indulgence shown by the police on the basis of
         their representation sent to the SSP/SP of the concerned District;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_7">         vii)       If despite the intimation having been sent to the SSP/SP there is
         an apprehension or threat of violation of right of personal life and
         liberty or free movement, the remedy of approaching the High Court
         should be the last report;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_8">         viii)      In case there is an authority constituted for issuance of marriage
         certificate as per the law laid down by Supreme Court in Seema's case
         (supra) in the concerned districts, the couple of so called 'run away
         marriage' should get the marriage registered in compliance with the
         directions of the Supreme Court and a copy of the same should also be
         forwarded to the police alongwith the representations or any time
         subsequent thereto.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_9">         ix).       Nothing said hereinabove will prevent the immediate arrest of a
         person who fraudulently entices a girl with false promises and exploits
         her sexually as per the statement of the girl."</blockquote><p id="p_8">
