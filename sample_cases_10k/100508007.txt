                         BENCH AT GWALIOR

Shri S.K. Shrivastava, Advocate for the appellant.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                      ORDER
</pre><p id="p_1">                                  ( 24 / 11 / 2014)

        This Misc. Appeal is directed against the order dated 14.05.2013
passed by II Additional District Judge, Shivpuri in case No. 4/91 E.D.
</p><p id="p_2">2.      The present appellant is father of a lunatic son Mohan Das
Bansal. It is stated that said son is missing since 09.05.1989. He was
neither heard nor seen since 09.05.1989. In the year 1991, the present
appellant filed an application under Section 71 of Indian Lunacy Act,
1912. It was registered by the court below as Misc. Civil Appeal No.
4/91.
</p><p id="p_3">3.      In the said case, the appellant stated that because his lunatic son
is missing since 09.05.1989, therefore, the saving which was deposited
in National Saving Certificate amounting of Rs. 1,23,000 may be directed
to be managed by him so that said money can be saved. The court
below passed the order dated 14.05.1991 by directing that the National
Saving Certificate may be renewed and appellant shall act as trustee for
his son. It was further ordered that whenever need will arise, the money
can be used by the appellant with the leave of the Court. This order is
placed on record as Annexure P/2.
</p><p id="p_4">4.      The appellant continued to renew the deposits since 1991.
However, his son could not be traced till date. Hence, the appellant
prayed that the money kept in fixed deposit may be given to him. This
application is filed as Annexure P/3. The court below by impugned order
partly allowed the said application and did not grant the relief of returning
the said amount to the appellant. Shri S.K. Shrivastava submits that the
Court below has erred in passing the said order. Earlier order dated
                                        2                     MA.842/2013

14.05.1991 makes it clear that amount could have been returned with
the permission of the Court. The Court below has not dealt with this
aspect.
</p><p id="p_5">5.          A careful reading of order dated 14.05.1991 shows that the Court
below has directed that the appellant will act in the capacity of a trustee.
However, he can take prior permission if he intends to use the amount
for his own purpose. The court below in the impugned order dated
14.05.2013 has not assigned a single reason as to why the permission
was not granted to the appellant for using the said amount. The Court
below has merely opined that the appellant has to wait for the return of
his son and on his return, the said amount would be required to be paid
to him. The Court below did not consider its own earlier order, wherein
condition of permission was mentioned. In the opinion of this Court, the
Court below was required to examine the facts and circumstances of the
case to decide whether permission could be granted. The Court below
has not assigned a single reason for declining permission. Reasons are
heartbeat of conclusion. In absence of reasons, conclusion cannot be
permitted to stand.
</p><p id="p_6">6.          Resultantly, order dated 14.05.2013 is set aside. The Court below
is directed to provide rehearing on application Annexure P/3 and decide
it in accordance with law. Needless to mention that court below will be
required to deal with the factual backdrop of the matter, wherein it is
stated that lunatic son is not traceable since May, 1989. In this backdrop,
the Court below will decide whether any useful purpose would be served
in not granting permission for release of the amount. More so, when
appellant / trustee is father of lunatic son. He is a law abiding person and
sincere father himself deposited the said amount. It is expected that
court below will decide the matter within 30 days from the date of
production of certified copy of this order.
</p><p id="p_7">7.          Appeal stands disposed of without expressing any opinion on the
merits of the case.</p><pre id="pre_2">
