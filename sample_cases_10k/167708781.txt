</p><p id="p_10">1.   Whether the prosecution proves beyond all
     reasonable doubt that the accused being public
     servant working as Government servant working
     as Revenue Inspector, Varthur Circle, Bengaluru
     South, Bengaluru Taluk and during his tenure as
     a public servant for the period from 08.09.1972
     to 03.01.2000 the accused acquired properties
     and assets disproportionate to his known sources
     of income and that on or about 03.01.2000 the
     accused was found in possession of pecuniary
     resources and property in his name and in the
     name of his family members to the tune of Rs
     61,14,819.57 paise and the expenses of the
     accused and his family members during the
     check period was Rs 9,92,243.75 paise and the
     total income of the accused and his family
     members was Rs 71,07,063.32 paise and that
     during the said period the known source of
     income was Rs 34,80,850.00 and thus the
     accused was found in possession of property
     disproportionate to his known source of income
     to the extent of Rs 36,26,213.32 paise for which
     the accused has not satisfactorily accounted and

</p><p id="p_13">      7. My findings on the above points are as:

      Point No.1: In the negative

      Point No.2: As per final order, for the following

                           REASONS

</p><p id="p_14">      8.    It is the case of the prosecution that the

accused being a public servant holding the post of

Revenue Inspector of Varthur Circle, Bengaluru City has

accumulated asset worth of Rs 36,26,213.32 paise

which is 104.17% disproportionate to the known source

of income during the check period 08.09.1972 to

03.01.2000 and he has not satisfactory explained about

the possession of the property illegally.



</p><p id="p_15">     9. Before going to decide the merits of the case, it

is necessary to decide the validity of the sanction order

at Ex P5 issued by the Deputy Commissioner, Bengaluru

Urban.
</p>
<p id="p_16">      10. Valid sanction is sine qua non in the case

under the <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_10">Prevention of Corruption Act</a> 1988. In view of

<a href="/doc/21238948/" id="a_11">section 19</a> of the Act the Court cannot take cognizance
                             8              Spl.C.C.148/2005




of the offence punishable under <a href="/doc/324254/" id="a_12">section 7</a>, <a href="/doc/1101716/" id="a_13">13(1)(d)</a> read

with <a href="/doc/1259316/" id="a_14">section 13(2)</a> of the Prevention of Corruption Act

1988 alleged to have been committed by the public

servant except with the previous sanction by the

competent authority.     It is well settled law that the

sanction order can be challenged on two grounds; one is

the competency of the sanctioning authority and another

is the non-application of mind by the sanctioning

authority.
</p>
<p id="p_17">

</p><p id="p_18">        11. PW.4 M.S.Sadiq who was working as Deputy

Commissioner, Bengaluru Urban has deposed that he

has received the letter from the Assistant Director

General of Police, Lokayuktha, Bengaluru along with the

prosecution papers such as FIR, Mahazars, final report

and   other   documents    seeking   sanction   order   to

prosecute the accused for the alleged offences. After

perusal of the prosecution papers he found that there

was a prima facie case to issue sanction order to

prosecute the accused.     Accordingly, he issued Ex P5
                               9              Spl.C.C.148/2005




sanction order to prosecute the accused. In the course

of cross examination, nothing has been elicited that he

has not applied his mind while issuing sanction order

and he is not the competent authority to accord sanction

order at Ex P5. The only contention of the accused that

the PW 4 has issued the sanction order mechanically

though there were no disproportionate assets against

the accused.
</p>
<p id="p_19">

</p><p id="p_20">         12. On careful perusal of the sanction order at Ex

P5 and the evidence of PW 4 proves that PW 4 is the

competent authority to accord sanction to prosecute the

accused and he has applied his mind for issuing sanction

order. Thus, the prosecution has proved the sanction

order issued by PW 4 for prosecuting the accused is

valid.
</p>
<p id="p_21">
</p><p id="p_22">         13.          Now the next point that arises for

consideration is whether the accused has accumulated

the asset disproportionate to the known source of

income during the check period from 08.09.1972 to
                             10             Spl.C.C.148/2005




03.01.2000.     According to the prosecution, during the

check period, the total asset of the accused is

Rs.61,14,819.57 paise and the expenditure of the

accused is Rs.09,92,243.73 paise and the income of the

accused is Rs.34,80,850.00 and disproportionate asset

to the known source of income is Rs.36,26,213.32 paise

which is 104.17%.        It is the specific case of the

prosecution that the accused has amassed wealth in his

name and in the name of his family members illegally

during the check period.
</p>
<p id="p_23">
</p><p id="p_24">  14.         On reading of the decision reported in 1991

(3) SCC page 6555 in K. Veeraswamy V/s Union

of India wherein their Lordships have held as under:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">           "Statutory evidence which must be
           proved by the prosecution, it is for
           the prosecution to prove that the
           accused or any person on his behalf
           has been in possession of pecuniary
           resource or property disproportionate
           to his known source of income.
           When that onus is discharged by the
           prosecution, it is for the accused to
                            11                 Spl.C.C.148/2005




           account     satisfactorily   for      the
           disproportionate of the properties
           possessed by him."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_25">   15.    In view of the said decision, the initial burden

to is on the prosecution to prove that accused has

amassed wealth in his name and in the name of his

family member. If the initial burden is not discharged by

the prosecution, the onus does not shift to the accused

to offer his explanation as to how he could have been in

possession of either directly or through some other

members of his family in possession of the property

disproportionate to the known source of income.

acquired by him during his tenure of his service.        He

stated while examining him under <a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_15">section 313</a> of Cr.P.C

argued that the accused has not declared the ancestral

taken into consideration the said asset.      The partition

decree obtained by him immediately within a span of 2-3

months by instituting the suit. The accused created the

documents to prove that he has not acquired the

property disproportionate to his known source of

income.        Further, the accused has not placed any

material to prove that he has received the advance and

rent    from    the    various   tenants.   Therefore,    the

Investigating Officer has not taken into consideration of

the said rental amount. The calculation of amount of

during the check period.
</p>
<p id="p_82">
</p><p id="p_83">  32.         Let us discuss the disputed items of the

property and income raised by the accused by one by

one. According to the accused, the property obtained

under the partition deed has to be excluded in the asset

column calculated by the prosecution. On perusal of Ex

P57 the certified copy of the order sheet, plaint in

O.S.NO.7604/1994 filed on 23.12.1994 on the file of

XVIII   Additional   City    Civil   Court,    Bengaluru       and

compromise petition.           Compromise decree dated

21.05.1995 discloses that in the year 1994 one

P.Shivashankar       Reddy      instituted      the     suit    in

O.S.NO.7604/1994       against       the      first    defendant

Muniswamy Reddy, 2nd defendant Sri.Ramareddy (the

accused herein) and 3rd defendant Madusudhan for

partition and separate possession and the said suit was

ended in compromise on 25.01.1995.                    As per the

compromise decree 'B' schedule was allotted to the
                              27               Spl.C.C.148/2005




share of the accused. 'B' schedule is the site No.950/40

situated at 27th Main Road, 9th Block, Jayanagar,

Bengaluru measuring 40 x 60 with R.C.C roof, Site

No.397, 11th cross, 11th phase, 20th Main Road,

J.P.Nagar, Bengaluru with RCC roof building and

Sy.No.79/4 measuring 28 guntas of Jigani village, Anekal

Taluk. The said property acquired by the accused has

not been disputed by PW 10 the Investigating Officer in

the course of cross examination.          According to the

Investigating Officer, the accused has manipulated

documents     to   show      that    he    has   not     own

disproportionate property.        I need to note that the

parititon suit filed on 23.12.1994.       The said suit was

ended in compromise on 25.01.1995. The criminal case

for the offence punishable under <a href="/doc/669669/" id="a_16">section 13(1)(e)</a> read

with <a href="/doc/1259316/" id="a_17">section 13(2)</a> of The Prevention of Corruption Act,

1988 in crime No.1/2000 was registered by CW 1 on

03.01.2000.    So the accused has got the property

through the partition decree five years prior to the

institution of the suit.     It cannot be said that the
                             28             Spl.C.C.148/2005




accused has anticipated of a possible raid by the

Lokayuktha Police after 5 years and he has to create

documents to show that he has acquired the property

legally.   Five years prior to the registration of the

present criminal case, the accused has got property

under compromise decree in the partition suit. After, he

got the property under partition decree, the accused has

declared the same in Ex P58 Income Tax Returns for the

assessment year 1995-96 and 1996-97.


</p><p id="p_84">33.           In page 17 of his cross examination, the

Investigating Officer has stated that the property got by

the accused under partition decree worth of Rs 28 lakhs,

but the accused has suggested that the said property

acquired through partition decree is Rs20,77,637/-. On

perusal of the assets calculated by the Investigating

Officer in Ex P77 discloses that the Investigating Officer

has taken into consideration of the property acquired by

the accused under compromise partition decree related

to commercial complex No.950/40, 27th Main Road, 9th

Block, Jayanagar, Bengaluru at Rs 5,25,637/-, house

No.397, 11th Cross, 2nd Stage, 20th Main Road,

J.P.Nagar, Bengaluru at Rs 10,44,000/- and 28 guntas of

land in Sy.No.79/4 of Jigani village, Anekal Taluk at Rs

8,000/- and total of these three items comes to Rs

15,77,637/-.      Though, the Investigating Officer has

admitted that the property got by the accused under

partition decree worth Rs 28,00,000/-, but he has not

properly explained as to why he has not excluded the

said value of the amount in the asset column. The said

value of the property acquired by the accused under

partition decree must be excluded in the asset column

calculated by the Investigating Officer.           As per the

prosecution, the total asset of the accused during the

check period is Rs 61,14,819.57.           Item Nos 1 to 3

shown in the asset column of the accused are the

properties     acquired   by    the    accused     under     the

compromise partition decree.          The said value of the

property taken by the Investigating Officer at Rs

5,25,637.00, Rs 10,44,000/- and Rs 8,000/- and that

value of the property has to be excluded from the asset
                            30             Spl.C.C.148/2005




of the accused. As per the prosecution, the total asset

and expenditure of the accused was Rs 71,07,062/- (Rs

61,14,819.57 + 9,92,243-75). After the deducting the

amount     of Rs 15,77,637/- (Rs 5,25,637.00, Rs

10,44,000/- and Rs 8,000/-) the total asset and

expenditure of the accused comes to Rs 55,29,427/-.


</p><p id="p_85">34.        The accused has taken up the contention

that in Ex P77 page No.29 shown the house No.397

situated at 11th Cross, 2nd Stage, 20th Main Road,

J.P.Nagara, Bengaluru sold by the accused in the year

1995 for sale consideration of Rs 13,55,000/- and the

same has been declared by the accused in Ex P58 Page

89 of Income Tax Returns.       The said fact has been

admitted by PW 10 in the course of cross examination.


</p><p id="p_86">  35.      On perusal of Ex P77 income calculated bh

the Investigating Officer discloses that the said amount

of Rs 13,55,000/- has been taken into account in income

column of the accused. Therefore, the arguments of the

learned counsel for the accused that the said sale

consideration    amount   has    not   been     taken    into

consideration by the Investigating Officer in income

column of the accused is not acceptable and does not

holds water.
</p>
<p id="p_87">
</p><p id="p_88">  36.          Now the next point raised by the accused

that the rent received by the accused from tenants and

advance rent has not been taken into consideration by

the Investigating Officer. On reading of evidence of PW

10 in para 31 of his cross examination, he admitted that

the accused has produced two rental deeds along with

the schedule and he has received the advance rent of Rs

1,00,000/- and Rs 75,000/- from two tenants. Further,

PW 10 has stated that he has not taken into account the

rents received by the accused from various other

tenants as the accused has not produced documents

before him. But PW 10 has admitted that the receipt of

rents and advance amount has been declared by the

accused in Ex P51 of Annual Property Returns (APR) to

the department and in Ex P58 Income Tax returns for

the year 1997-98 and 1998-99. The said rental income
                            32              Spl.C.C.148/2005




and the advance rent must be considered by the

Investigating Officer in the income side of the ax. As

per the prosecution, the total income of the accused

during the check period is Rs 34,80,850/-. By including

the rents, security deposit amount and advance amount

(Rs 4,35,000/- + 4,00,000/- + Rs 1,75,000/- =

Rs.10,10,000/-)   it   comes    to   Rs.10,10,000/-   and

therefore, the income of the accused during the check

period comes to Rs 44,90,850/-.
</p>
<p id="p_89">
</p><p id="p_90">  37.     The next item disputed by the accused is that

the accused has sold the land bearing Sy.No.156 and

156/3 totally measuring 10 acres of land for sale

consideration of Rs 10,00,000/-. The said fact has been

admitted by PW 1 in para 30 of his cross examination.

The accused sold the property and the said amount has

to be considered as income of the accused.            The

Investigating Officer has considered only advance sale

consideration of Rs 2,75,000/-, but he has not

considered the remaining sale consideration amount of

Rs 7,25,000/- in the income column of the accused. The
                            33             Spl.C.C.148/2005




Investigating Officer has committed an error by not

taking   into   consideration    the   remaining     sale

consideration amount in the income column. The said

amount of Rs 7,25,000/- must be included in the income

column of the accused during the check period and after

adding of the said amount, the income of the accused

comes to (Rs 44,90,850/- + 7,25,000/-= 52,15,850/-)

Rs.52,15,850/- during the check period and thus, the

Investigating Officer has committed an error.


</p><p id="p_91">  38.      The land bearing Sy.No.56 and 56/3 sold by

the accused and the same has been admitted by PW 1.

When the said landed property was sold by the accused,

the value of the said land of Rs 1,50,000/- cannot be

taken into account in the asset value of the accused.

Therefore, the said amount of Rs 1,50,000/- relating to

value of sale of the land bearing Sy.No.56 and 56(3)

must be excluded in the total asset and expenditure of

the accused.    The total asset of the accused was Rs

55,29,425/- and by excluding the value of the said land

at Rs 1,50,000/-, it comes to (Rs 55,29,425 - Rs
                               34                 Spl.C.C.148/2005




1,50,000/- = 53,79,425/-) Rs 53,79,425/- including the

expenditure.     Therefore,        the   total   value   of   the

immovable property standing in the name of the

accused and his family members is Rs 53,79,425/-

accused has amassed wealth during the check period

disproportionate to the known source of income.
