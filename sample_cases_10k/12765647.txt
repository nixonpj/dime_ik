<p id="p_1">      Petitioner, who is a Driver Special Grade I,           has

filed this writ petition challenging Ext.P6 order by

which he was transferred from Munnar to               Vazhathope

Sub Regional Store at Kattappana, on 21.08.2017, by

transferring,     one    Mr.Raju,     from    Vazhathope     SRS,

Kattappana to Moolamattom.
</p>
<p id="p_2">      2.    The   petitioner        submits    that     he     is

transferred to Kattappana, which is named Vazhathope

SRS   as    against     his   request   for    a   posting    at

Vazhathope Research and Dam Safety Sub Division No.1,

where a vacancy is available. According to him, he is

denied transfer to that station, as a retaliatory

measure. It is stated that Vzhathope SRS where he is

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                      2</span>



posted is 27 kms away from                       Vazhathope, which he

requested and the vacancy at Vzhathope is filled up

by a contract employee. Aggrieved by Ext.P6 order, he

submitted     an    appeal,       which         was    rejected     as    per

Ext.P10 common order, without stating any reason.

</p><p id="p_3">      3. Petitioner            points      out    that      while   he    was

working at Vazhathope, which is very near to his

residence,    he     was    transferred           to    Kallarkutty       and

thereafter    to     Munnar.      Aggrieved            by   this,   he    had

requested for posting him back at Vazhathope and had

filed W.P.(C) No.35008 of 2016 and this Court had

directed      the         respondents            to         consider      the

representation       of    petitioner.           Thereafter,        the   2 nd

respondent     had    issued          Ext.P3      order,        asking    the

petitioner to submit his application for transfer at

the time of the next general transfer of 2017. It is

pointed out that when orders of general transfer was

issued   in   2017,       he    was       not    given      a   posting   at
W.P.(C).No.32978 of 2017
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                3</span>



Vazhathope,        though   there   arose    a    vacancy    and

petitioner         submitted    Ext.P5       application      on

25.01.2017; but as per Ext.P6 order, he was posted 27

kms away from Vazhathope at Kattappana, which is

named as Vazhathope Sub Regional Store. Though, he

submitted Ext.P7A appeal, it was rejected as per

Ext.P10 order without stating any reason. The writ

petition     was    filed   challenging     the   transfer   and

denial of posting at the station which petitioner

requested.
</p>
<p id="p_4">   4.      The learned Counsel on both sides submit

that applications for general transfer for this year-

2018 is being processed. Therefore, petitioner would

be free to submit his application. Learned Counsel

for the petitioner submits that petitioner would be

satisfied with a direction to the first respondent to

consider his case as stated in Ext.P3 order.

</p><p id="p_5">     In the above circumstances, the writ petition is
W.P.(C).No.32978 of 2017
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                              4</span>



disposed    of,   directing       that   the   case    of   the

petitioner shall be considered at the time of general

transfer for which he would submit application, in

tune with the assurance made in Ext.P3 order.
