used to visit in the neighbouring house of one Suraj.   On the basis of said 

statement, FIR U/s 363 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_3">IPC</a> was registered in PS Aman Vihar.

statement   U/s   164   <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_5">Cr.P.C</a>.   was   got   recorded.    She  was   also  got   medically 

examined in the hospital.  She stated before investigating officer that she had 

married   with   accused   and   the   accused   did   not   use   any   force   against   her. 

During the course of investigation, offence u/s 366 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_6">IPC</a> was also added and 

the accused was formally arrested in this case.  
</p>
<p id="p_3">                         After   completion   of   investigation,   chargesheet   had   been   filed 

before the Court.
</p>
<p id="p_4">                         After compliance of <a href="/doc/1613898/" id="a_7">section 207</a> Cr.P.C., the case was committed 

to the Court of Sessions and was assigned to Ld. Predecessor of this Court.

</p><p id="p_5">                         After hearing arguments on the point of charge, Ld. Predecessor 

of this Court was pleased to frame the charge u/s 363/366 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_8">IPC</a> against the 

accused   vide order dated 13.01.12 to which accused pleaded not guilty and 

claimed trial.  
</p>
<p id="p_6">                         In   support   of   its   case,   prosecution   examined   as   many   as   six 

witnesses  namely   PW1   Smt. Nirmala Devi, PW2 HC  Jai  Singh, PW3  Dr. 

Rajesh Kohli, PW4 Sh. Udai Raj, PW5 Ct. Ravinder Kumar and PW6 i.e 'V'.

</p><p id="p_7">                         Considering the fact that none of the star witnesses relied by the 

prosecution in the present case, had supported the prosecution story on any 

material point, prosecution evidence has been closed as no useful purpose 

would have been served in examining the remaining prosecution witnesses as 

it   would   have   been   an   exercise   in   futility   in   examining   those   prosecution 

witnesses besides wastage of precious time of the Court.

</pre><p id="p_8">                         Since there was no incriminating evidence against the accused, 

his statement u/s 313 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_10">Cr.P.C</a>.  had  been dispensed with.

</p><p id="p_9">                         I have heard Sh. Pankaj Bhatia, Ld. Addl. PP on behalf of State 

and ld. counsel Sh. Mahesh Kumar Adv. on behalf of accused.   I have also 

gone through the material available on record.
</p>
<p id="p_10">                         Before discussing the submissions made on behalf of both the 

sides,   it   would   be   appropriate   to   discuss,   in   brief   the   testimonies   of   the 

aforesaid  star witnesses examined by prosecution during trial.

                         It has been argued by Ld Additional PP that accused herein had 

kidnapped "V" by inducing her to go away from the lawful guardianship of 

her parents.  In this regard, he heavily relied upon the testimony of PW6 i.e. 

"V" wherein she has deposed that she had accompanied the accused to Tis 

Hazari   Court   premises   where   she   entered   into   marriage   with   him   by 

exchanging   garlands with each other.  He further argued that since accused 

compelled "V"  to enter into marriage with him, offence U/s 366 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_15">IPC</a> has also 

been proved in this case.  Therefore, the accused should be convicted for the 

said offence. 
</p>
<p id="p_25">                         On the other hand, Ld. counsel of accused vehemently argued 

that both the star witnesses of prosecution i.e. PW4 and PW6 did not support 

its case on any material point and thus, prosecution has failed to prove its case

defined in <a href="/doc/1515807/" id="a_17">Section 361</a> IPC, which reads as under:

</p><p id="p_28">                         It is quite evident from the bare perusal of aforesaid provision 

that inducement or allurement of minor by the accused, is sine足qua足 non for 

attracting the offence of kidnapping which is punishable by <a href="/doc/619940/" id="a_18">Section 363</a> IPC. 

It is well settled law that where a minor herself leaves the house of her father 

without any inducement or allurement by the accused and where the accused 

merely allows her to accompany him, the accused cannot be held guilty of 

kidnapping. Still if any authority is required, then reference with advantage 

can be made to the judgment of Hon'ble Apex Court in the matter titled as 

<a href="/doc/990563/" id="a_19">State of Haryana vs. Raja Ram</a> reported at AIR 1973 SC 819.  Similar view 

has   been   taken   by   Hon'ble   Apex   Court   in   the   celebrated   judgment   of 

<a href="/doc/1163239/" id="a_20">Varadarajan vs. State of Madras</a> reported at AIR 1965 SC 942.

<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_22">Cr.P.C</a>. is not made out when a minor girl, of her own accord, comes out of 

the custody of her lawful guardians and at subsequent point of time, accused 

joins her.  
</p>
<p id="p_30">                         It may also be noted here that offence of kidnapping is not made 

out where a minor girl is found to be in the company of accused. Same is not 

sufficient to prove the offence of kidnapping unless and until there is some 

cogent evidence on record to show that it was the accused alone who had 

enticed or took away the minor with some kind of inducement.   The entire 

burden to prove the same lies upon the prosecution and said burden has to be 

discharged beyond reasonable doubt.

<p id="p_31">                         In the case in hand, PW6 i.e. "V" herself admitted during chief 

examination   itself   that   accused   had   not   kidnapped   her   from   the   lawful 

guardianship of her parents.  She has also testified that she had left her house 

of her own and no one had induced her in this regard.
</p>
<p id="p_32">                         The reliance placed by Ld. Additional PP upon the testimony of 

PW4 who is none else but natural father/guardian of "V", would also go to 

show that nothing incriminating has come on record during the testimony of 

said witness as she admitted during cross examination that he did not see  any 

person   including   accused   taking   her   daughter   away   from   his   lawful 

guardianship.   He also admitted during cross examination that her daughter 

"V" was not recovered from the possession of accused and he has merely 

raised suspicion against the accused.   It needs no emphasis that suspicion 

alone cannot take place of proof.   That being so, Court is of the view that

prosecution has been miserably failed to show that it was the accused who 



had enticed the victim i.e. "V" or had taken her away out of the keeping of 

her lawful guardianship or without the consent of her guardien.

</p><p id="p_33">                         This brings me down to the other offence punishable U/s 366 

<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_24">IPC</a>   charged   against   the   accused   in   this   case.   In   order   to   prove   the   said 

offence, it was mandatory for the prosecution to establish by way of cogent 

evidence that the accused herein had compelled the victim "V" to enter into 

marriage with him.  The other parts of <a href="/doc/796352/" id="a_25">Section 366</a> IPC are undisputedly not 

applicable to the facts of the case herein.   However, the prosecution again 

failed to prove the same during the course of trial.   Rather, PW6 i.e. "V" 

admitted during her cross examination that she had introduced herself to be 

major/adult   before   the   accused   and   had   disclosed   her   date   of   birth   to   be 

16.04.1991 to the accused.  She also admitted that she was well aware about 

the fact that for entering into valid marriage as per Hindu law, saptpadi is 

mandatory.  She also admitted that no saptpadi had taken place between the 

accused and her at any point of time.  Not only this, she also deposed during 

chief   examination  itself   that accused never pressurized her for performing 

marriage with him nor forced her to do any illegal act.  That being so, Court 

is of the considered opinion that all   the necessary ingredients of offence 

punishable U/s 366 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_26">IPC</a> could not be fulfilled by way of evidence, which has 

come on record in this case.
