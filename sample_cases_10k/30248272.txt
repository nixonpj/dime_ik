</p> 
<p id="p_5">It is submitted by learned counsel for the applicant that it is a matrimonial dispute and all the disputes and differences have been settled between the parties. At this stage, learned counsel further submitted that continuation of the proceedings of the aforesaid case will be an abuse of process of law. No fruitful purpose would be served in keeping the matter pending. In support of his contention, learned counsel for the applicant has also placed reliance on the law laid down by Apex Court in <a href="/doc/69949024/" id="a_7">Gian Singh vs. State of Punjab</a>, (2012), 10 SCC 303, <a href="/doc/469138/" id="a_8">B.S.

<p id="p_8">In all the aforesaid cases, the Apex Court has laid down the law that criminal proceedings may be quashed even in non-compoundable cases by the High Court in exercise of its extraordinary jurisdiction to restore peace between the parties and in case the justice so demands. According to Hon'ble Supreme Court, if the offence involve private dispute between the parties of commercial nature or matrimonial dispute and it is not related to heinous offence, the proceedings may be quashed. 
</p> 
<p id="p_9">Since the dispute between the parties has been amicably and mutually settled, no fruitful purpose would be served by permitting to continue the criminal case pending before the trial court and it would simply be a waste of time if the aforesaid case is permitted to continue till its logical conclusion.
</p> 
<p id="p_10">In view of the above, the Application u/s 482 <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_10">Cr.P.C</a>. is allowed.
</p>
