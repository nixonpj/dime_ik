             -------------------------------------------
                W.P.(C) No.10949 of 2010
             -------------------------------------------
        Dated this the 30th day of March, 2010

                          JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">     The complaint of the petitioner is that though he has

completed 19 years service with the first respondent

Society, he has not been issued with a Service Certificate

for  production      before     the    Kerala     Public Service

Commission (hereinafter referred to as the 'Commission'

for short).   The petitioner says that he is desirous of

getting an appointment in the Kottayam District Co-

operative Bank Ltd. as Clerk/Cashier in the service

category. The petitioner was terminated from the service

of the first respondent on 14.5.2009 since he could not

discharge a liability that had accrued on the advance

amount received by him.               However, the Managing

Committee     readmitted       him    on    18.12.2009   on his

discharging the liability.         His service has not been

regularised thereafter. Therefore, there is a break in his

service. Though he has applied for the issue of a Service

Certificate, the second respondent has not issued the same

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">wpc No.10949/2010          2</span>

   till date. Therefore, he has sought appropriate directions

   for the issue of a Service Certificate. He has also sought a

   direction to the Commission to issue an advice memo to

   him.
</p>
<p id="p_2">         2. The prayer of the petitioner is opposed by the

   Standing Counsel for the Commission, Mr.Alexander

   Thomas. He points out that the petitioner has not been

   included in the rank list and therefore no advice memo

   could be issued to him. According to the counsel, the rank

   list has been finalized on 31.12.2009 and the petitioner's

   name has not been included in the rank list. Therefore,

   there is no question of even including him in the rank list.

</p><p id="p_3">         3. The counsel for the petitioner on the other hand

   submits that the action of the second respondent in not

   issuing a Service Certificate to him or even considering his

   request for the issue of the same is without any

   justification.   According to the counsel, the second

   respondent has a duty to consider his request for the issue

   of a Service Certificate which may be used by the

   petitioner for any purpose.
</p>
<p id="p_4">         4. Since the rank list of the Commission has already

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">wpc No.10949/2010         3</span>

   been published on 31.12.2009 and since the petitioner has

   not been included in the said rank list, the second prayer

   of the petitioner cannot be granted. Regarding the issue

   a Service Certificate, as the matter is still pending

   consideration of the second respondent, I feel that the

   second respondent can be directed to consider and pass

   appropriate orders on the petitioner's request on an early

   date.
</p>
<p id="p_5">         5. In the above circumstances, this Writ Petition is

   disposed of directing the second respondent to consider

   the request of the petitioner for the issue of a Service

   Certificate evidenced herein by Ext.P5 in accordance with

   law    and    to pass  appropriate    orders   thereon   as

   expeditiously as possible and at any rate within a period of

   one month from the date of receipt of a copy of this

   judgment.
