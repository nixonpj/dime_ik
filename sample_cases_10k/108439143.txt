BEFORE THE MADURAI BENCH OF MADRAS HIGH COURT               

DATED: 09.10.2018  

CORAM   

THE HONOURABLE MR.JUSTICE N.ANAND VENKATESH              

W.P.(MD)No.21096 of 2018   

A.S.Nabeen Noor Mohamed                                 ... Petitioner      

Vs.

1.The Superintendent of Police,
   Pudukkottai,  Pudukkottai District.

2.The Deputy Superintendent of Police,
   Office of the Deputy Superintendent of Police,
   Pudukkottai,  Pudukkottai District.

3.The Inspector of Police,
   Ganesh Nagar Police Station,
   Pudukkottai District.                                                ... Respondents

PRAYER:- Petition filed under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India
seeking a Writ of Certiorarified Mandamus, to call for the records pertaining
to the impugned order dated 30.09.2018 on the file of the respondent No.3 and
quash the same as illegal and consequently direct the respondents 2 and 3 to
grant permission to conduct the Public Meeting to the petitioner's movement
with Mike and speakers and date in the place of Chinnappa Park, Pudukkottai,
Pudukkottai District.
                
!For Petitioner         : Mr.V.Selva
^For Respondents        : Mr.B.Bhagawathi 
                                                            Government Advocate 

:ORDER  
</pre><p id="p_1">        This Writ Petition has been filed challenging the impugned order dated
30.09.2018 passed by the third respondent rejecting the permission to conduct
a meeting, which was planned to be held on 05.10.2018.
</p><p id="p_2">        2.The learned counsel for the petitioner would submit that the
respondent police had rejected the permission only on the ground that the
place, wherein the meeting is planned to be held, is a busy place and
permitting the meeting to be conducted would lead to traffic congestion.  The
other reasons that have been stated in the impugned order are that there are
hospitals, public park and also other shops, which are located in the place,
where the meeting was planned to be held and therefore, if permission is
granted to conduct the meeting in that place, it will cause hardship to the
general public.  That apart, the impugned order also states that an order has
been passed under <a href="/doc/1158685/" id="a_2">Section 30(2)</a> of the Police Act and therefore, no
permission can be granted for the meeting.
</p>
<p id="p_3">        3.It is the specific case of the petitioner that in the very same
place, where the meeting was scheduled to be conducted, another meeting was  
permitted by the very same respondent police one week back.  Therefore, the
learned counsel for the petitioner would submit that the persons must be
treated equally by the police insofar as granting permission for conducting
public meeting.
</p>
<p id="p_4">        4.The fact that another meeting was held in the very same place one
week back, was not denied by the learned Government Advocate.  That apart the 
fact that an order has been passed under <a href="/doc/1158685/" id="a_3">Section 30(2)</a> of the police Act
cannot impose a total ban for conducting public meetings.  The said provision
is merely regulatory in nature and the same cannot be used to ban the right
of speech and expression.
</p>
<p id="p_5">        5.This Court is not convinced with the reasons given by the third
respondent to reject the permission for conducting public meeting.  Already
the date on which the meeting was scheduled to be held is over.  In the light
of the above, there shall be a direction to the petitioner to submit a fresh
representation to the third respondent and give a specific date and time on
which the meeting is going to be held.  The petitioner is also directed to
inform the respondent police with regard to the nature of issue that is going
to be addressed during the meeting.  The third respondent is directed to
grant permission to the petitioner to conduct the meeting.  It is open to the
third respondent to impose reasonable conditions for the purpose of
conducting the meeting in a peaceful manner without giving rise to any law
and order problem.  The petitioner is duty bound to comply with the
conditions imposed by the third respondent.
</p>
<p id="p_6">        6.In the result this Writ Petition is allowed with the above direction
and the impugned order passed by the third respondent is set aside.  No
costs.
</p>
