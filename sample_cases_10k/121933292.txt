<p id="p_1">Swatanter Kumar, J.
</p>


<p id="p_2">1.    Unlike natural calamities that are  beyond  human  control,  avoidable
disasters resulting  from  human  error/negligence  prove  more  tragic  and
completely imbalance the inter-generational equity and  cause  irretrievable
damage to the health and environment for generations to come.  Such  tragedy
may occur from pure negligence, contributory negligence or even  failure  to
take necessary precautions in carrying  on  certain  industrial  activities.
More often than not, the affected parties have to face avoidable damage  and
adversity that results from such disasters.  The  magnitude  and  extent  of
adverse impact on the financial soundness, social health and  upbringing  of
younger  generation,  including  progenies,  may  have  been  beyond   human
expectations.  In such situations and where  the  laws  are  silent  or  are
inadequate, the courts have unexceptionally stepped in to bridge  the  gaps,
to  provide  for  appropriate  directions  and  guidelines  to  ensure  that
fundamentals of <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1">Article 21</a> of the Constitution  of  India  (for  short  “the
Constitution”) are not violated.
</p>
<p id="p_3">2.    The Bhopal Gas Tragedy is a glaring example  of  such  imbalances  and
adverse impacts, where by court’s  intervention,  poor  and  destitute  have
been provided relief and rehabilitation.
</p>
<p id="p_4">3.    The Bhopal Gas Leak Disaster occurred on the intervening night of  the
2nd/3rd of December, 1984.  Data reflecting the  exact  number  of  affected
persons was not available initially.  Earlier,  it  was  felt  that  only  a
small number of persons were  adversely  affected  in  terms  of  health  or
otherwise by the leakage of toxic gases  from  the  Union  Carbide  Unit  at
Bhopal.  However,  the  Scientific  Commission  for  Continuing  Studies  on
Effects of Bhopal Gas Leakage on Life Systems  (for  short  the  ‘Scientific
Commission’)  released a Report titled ‘The Bhopal Gas Disaster: Effects  on
Life Systems’ in July, 1987 which suggested otherwise.  This  Report  stated
that for the estimated population of 2,00,000 exposed to the toxic gases  in
the severely and moderately affected areas of  Bhopal  and  the  variety  of
long-term problems anticipated in the crisis period, the number of  exposees
covered so far by the Indian Council of  Medical  Research  (for  short  the
‘ICMR’) through the epidemiological surveys  constitute  less  than  20  per
cent of the population.  With the  passage  of  time,  this  figure  of  the
affected population has swollen to nearly 5,00,000.  By the same  Scientific
Commission,  it  was  also  found  that  in  general,  the  output  of   the
epidemiological project so far had not equalled the magnitude of  the  tasks
assigned to them, presumably due to lack  of  resources,  trained  staff  as
well as physical inputs.  An opportunity for mounting such a  massive  long-
term longitudinal  study  on  a  population  exposed  to  a  one-time  acute
chemical stress may not present itself again and hence it would  be  a  pity
if that opportunity was missed.   Various  steps  were  recommended  by  the
Scientific Commission, from time to time, to tackle the two main aspects  of
this disaster.  Firstly, health care of the affected victims  and  secondly,
research work with the object to deal with the acute problems  arising  from
this disaster on the one hand and to suggest preventive steps on the  other.
</p>

<p id="p_5">4.    Writ Petition (Civil) No. 50 of 1998  was  filed  by  the  Bhopal  Gas
Peedith Mahila Udyog  Sanghathan  as  a  public  interest  litigation  under
<a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_2">Article 32</a> of the Constitution.  This petition was  founded  on  the  rights
available to the victims of the Bhopal Gas Disaster under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_3">Article 21</a> of  the
Constitution and it was prayed that they were entitled to receive  free  and
proper medical assistance from the respondents, the Union of India  and  the
State of Madhya Pradesh.   It  was  also  prayed  that  the  respondents  be
directed to take effective steps in that regard which  inter  alia  included
providing of free  medicines  and  preparing  a  detailed  plan  of  medical
rehabilitation that ensured the availability of basic medical facilities  to
the gas victims.  Lastly, it was also prayed that the ICMR  be  directed  to
resume  and  conduct  research  studies  and  to  make  public  the  reports
published by  it  so  as  to  provide  the  basic  ground  for  issuance  of
appropriate directions by this Court.
</p>
<p id="p_6">5.    This Court has been passing various directions right from  the  filing
of this petition and has directed certain effective and  positive  steps  to
be taken by the Union of India as well as the State  of  Madhya  Pradesh  to
ensure providing of appropriate medical treatment to the  gas  victims.   It
is no use referring to the different orders passed by this Court  from  time
to time in detail.  However, we will be referring to some of  the  important
orders in brief which have a bearing on the issue now  pending  before  this
Court and for passing of the final directions.
</p>
<p id="p_7">6.    To  begin  with,  the  ICMR  had  undertaken  certain  research  works
immediately after the Bhopal Disaster and appropriate steps had been  taken,
as claimed by the State  and  the  Central  Government,  to  deal  with  the
medical problems of the gas victims.  However, it appears  from  the  record
and has been averred before us that after 1994, the ICMR allegedly  took  an
irrational decision to disband  all  Bhopal  Gas  Disaster  related  medical
research.  This abandoning of research work has  been  seriously  criticised
in the present petition.  Certain appeals had been filed against  the  order
of the High Court of Madhya Pradesh which came to  be  registered  as  Civil
Appeal Nos. 3187-3188 of 1988, which were  subsequently  clubbed  with  Writ
Petition (Civil) No. 50 of 1998.   I.A. Nos. 32-35, 36-37  in  Civil  Appeal
Nos. 3187-3188 of 1988 titled “<a href="/doc/212673/" id="a_4">Union Carbide Corporation Ltd.  v.  Union  of
India</a>” were filed for seeking different  directions,  upon  which  and  vide
order dated 15th May, 1988, this  Court  directed  creation  of  the  Bhopal
Memorial Hospital and Research Centre (for short  ‘BMHRC’)  and  the  Bhopal
Memorial Hospital Trust (for short ‘BMHT/the Trust’) which  was  constituted
for the purposes of healthcare of the affected gas victims.   This  hospital
initially was to run for a period of eight years  which  term  was  extended
from time to time and then finally, vide order  dated  2nd  May,  2006,  the
term was extended till completion of its object. Further, vide  order  dated
17th July, 2007, this Court also sought report  from  the  ICMR  on  various
toxic effects of the leaked gas.
</p>
<p id="p_8">7.    This Court also, by order dated 17th September, 2004  passed  in  Writ
Petition (Civil) No. 50 of 1998, ordered  the  constitution  of  two  expert
committees being the ‘Monitoring Committee’ and  the  ‘Advisory  Committee’.
The latter was formed by ICMR under the Chairmanship of Director General  of
ICMR and its terms of reference were as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">           “(i)  To examine the treatment practices currently  followed  by
                  medical personnel in  the  hospitals/clinics  run  by  the
                  Government for the Bhopal  Gas  victims  for  the  various
                  ailments suffered by them.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">           (ii)  To recommend/advise on the appropriate line  of  treatment
                  to be offered to the Bhopal gas victims.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">           (iii) To recommend/advise on the structure and  content  of  the
                  research to be undertaken in order to improve the  quality
                  of the treatment being offered to the Bhopal Gas victims.”




</blockquote><p id="p_9">8.    The Advisory Committee has been submitting its reports  from  time  to
time and it was assured by the State  Government  that  the  said  Committee
will be provided with all facilities and technical inputs.  Then,  the  ICMR
conducted its research investigation  in  the  form  of  24  major  research
projects ranging from epidemiology to molecular biology  implemented  by  15
National Institutes.  Vide  letter  dated  17th  February,  2004,  from  the
Director General of  ICMR  to  the  Government  of  Madhya  Pradesh  it  was
indicated that with  respect  to  future  needs  for  research,  ICMR  would
facilitate the Madhya Pradesh State Government by constituting  a  Committee
of experts which would look into the work carried out between 1985  to  1994
as well as the subsequent research by the Centre for Rehabilitation  Studies
under the Bhopal Gas  Tragedy  Relief  and  Rehabilitation  Department  (for
short, the  ‘BGTRRD’),  Bhopal  from  1995  till  date,  so  as  to  provide
guidelines for future research.  On  24th  June,  2010,  the  Union  Cabinet
passed a  resolution  directing  the  ICMR  to  establish  a  new  permanent
research centre at Bhopal which was done on 11th October, 2010, namely,  the
National  Institute  of  Research  in  Environment  Health  (for  short  the
‘NIREH’).  The research work is  being  continued  by  the  ICMR,  while  it
submits its report to this Court from time to  time.   The  vision  document
was duly prepared by the NIREH.
</p>
<p id="p_10">9.    In the background of this vision document, it  is  stated  that  after
the  Methyl  Isocyanate  (MIC)  gas  episode  at  Bhopal,  various  research
programmes were conducted by the ICMR to monitor the research programme  and
also to undertake long term epidemiological studies to record the  morbidity
and mortality of the cohort of gas exposed and control population.
</p>
<p id="p_11">10.   In order to ensure smooth running of  the  BMHT,  a  corpus  had  been
created which was provided with funds and contributions that  were  invested
from time to time and the total corpus, as of now,  constitutes  Rs.  436.47
crores.  Out of this amount, Rs.226.61  crores  has  been  invested  in  RBI
Bonds in Banks, Rs. 196.54 crores in FDRs in Banks, Rs.11.65 crores  in  the
short term deposits in Flexi/Quantum in Banks  and  Rs.1.67  crores  is  the
bank balance.
</p>
<p id="p_12">11.   During the pendency of this  petition,  various  directions  had  been
passed by this Court to ensure smooth working  of  the  Trust  in  both  the
fields of health care and research work.  We may refer to  some  significant
orders passed by this Court.
</p>
<p id="p_13">12.   The surveys conducted  by  the  ICMR,  including  the  epidemiological
survey in 1994, showed multi-organ symptoms amongst the persons exposed  and
there  was  tremendous  increase  in  symptoms  exhibited  by  the  affected
persons.  There was even shortage of medicines and  various  representations
were made requesting improvement thereof.           Vide  order  dated  17th
September, 2004, the Court had spelt out the terms and  conditions  for  the
Monitoring Committee and the Advisory Committee.  It related  to  procedural
matters, functioning and terms of reference of  the  respective  Committees.
The  paramount  functions  of  the  Monitoring  Committee  were  to  monitor
suitability, availability and maintenance of medical equipments,  deployment
of  adequate  and  competent  medical  personnel,  more   specifically   the
treatment offered at the hospitals and the functioning  of  these  hospitals
run by the Government for the Bhopal Gas victims, purchase and  availability
of  medicines  to  the  affected  persons  etc.   Similarly,  the   Advisory
Committee, while determining its own rules of procedure, was to examine  the
treatment practices currently followed  by  the  medical  personnel  in  the
hospitals run by the Government for these victims  in  relation  to  various
ailments suffered by them.  Further, this Committee  was  to  recommend  and
advice on the appropriate line of treatment to be offered to the Bhopal  gas
victims.  It was further to recommend and advise  on  the  kind  of  medical
equipments and medicines required to be procured to improve the  quality  of
treatment being offered to the victims as well as to initiate and  recommend
community   health   initiatives   in   health   education   and   community
participation for prevention and care.
</p>
<p id="p_14">13.   Then vide order dated 17th July, 2007, the Court  directed  the  State
of Madhya Pradesh to take necessary steps for computerising the  records  of
the hospital so that the details of the patients and/or their ailments  were
made permanent record to ensure their proper treatment in  future.   One  of
the factors which invited the attention of the Court at that time  was  that
the patients who were not the victims of the gas tragedy  had  also  started
coming to the hospital, which led to passing of an order wherein  the  Court
required the Monitoring Committee  to  submit  a  report  if  the  treatment
facilities afforded to such patients were adversely affecting the  treatment
of the gas victims.
</p>
<p id="p_15">14.   Various reports were submitted by the two  Committees  afore-mentioned
which were considered from time to time by this  Court.   Vide  order  dated
15th November, 2007, the Court had called upon the State of  Madhya  Pradesh
to provide answers to the questions which  were  raised  by  the  Monitoring
Committee which was  overseeing  the  functions  of  the  hospital  and  the
research work.  Report was also  sought  from  the  ICMR  on  various  toxic
effects of the gas.
</p>
<p id="p_16">15.   Thereafter, because of certain events, the Chairman of BMHT  resigned.
 The co-ordination and smooth functioning of these units  was  found  to  be
lacking and many applications in this regard were filed  before  the  Court.
As already noticed, the Court had directed setting  up  of  a  hospital  for
treatment of Bhopal Gas victims vide its  order  dated  15th  May,  1988  in
furtherance to which the hospital was established and  even  the  Trust  was
registered  on  11th  August,  1988.    There  existed  uncertainty  in  the
decision making process.  The Attorney General for India  made  a  statement
that the Union of India had decided to  take  over  the  BMHRC  and  run  it
through Department of Biotechnology and Department of Automic  Energy.    In
furtherance to this statement, the Court disposed of I.A. No. 58-59 of  2009
and vide its order dated 19th July, 2010, the  Court  directed  the  Central
Government to take steps for winding  up  the  Trust  and  taking  over  the
management of the hospital.
</p>
<p id="p_17">16.   Thereafter, certain IAs came to be filed before this Court.  In  these
IAs, different parties had prayed for issuance of  different  directions  in
relation to the working, management and control of BMHRC.  IA  Nos.62-63  of
2011 in Civil Appeal Nos.3167-3188 of 1988 have been filed with  the  prayer
that the Union of India be directed to take charge of the  corpus  funds  of
the erstwhile BMHT through its Department of  Biotechnology  and  Department
of Atomic Energy and transfer the accounts of BMHT to  the  new  management.
It was also prayed that the management of the erstwhile BMHT be relieved  of
all its responsibilities pertaining to management  of  the  corpus  and  new
authorised  signatories  be  appointed  for  its  accounts.   One   of   the
petitioners in the main petition filed an application being  IA  No.  14  of
2012, primarily relying upon the letter written by Dr. Sathyamala,  (Member,
Advisory Committee) to Dr. P.M. Bhargava, (Member,  Advisory  Committee  and
Chairperson of the Task Force).  It was prayed that the  same  be  taken  on
record and the Advisory Committee be  directed  to  submit  minutes  of  its
meetings dated 13th August, 2009, 22nd September, 2010  and  10th  December,
2011.  Petitioner Nos.1 and 3 have filed IA No.16 of 2012 wherein they  have
prayed for issuance of certain directions.   In  this  application,  it  has
been stated that the Monitoring Committee in its reports  dated  10th  June,
2005, 31st October, 2005, 12th July, 2006, 20th December 2006,  7th  August,
2007 and 27th May, 2008 have  consistently  recommended  computerization  of
the hospital records and issuance of ‘health booklets’ to the  gas  victims.
It is averred that recommendations of the Advisory Committee have  not  been
complied with by the State Government,  the  ICMR  and  even  the  Union  of
India.  They have also made a suggestion for issuance of  ‘smart  cards’  to
the gas affected victims besides issuance of proper  health  booklets.   The
NIREH, as established by the ICMR, though was a welcome step,  according  to
these  applicants  much  is  desired  of  the  functioning  of  NIREH.   The
allegation is that the decision makers at the ICMR are doing  everything  on
their part to ensure that the crucial issues affecting the life  and  health
of  the  gas  victims  remain  unaddressed  at  a  macro  level.   All   the
concentration presently is on building the  infrastructure  for  the  NIREH.
On this premise, the applicants have prayed that the  orders  of  the  Court
should be complied with by the State of Madhya Pradesh as well as  the  ICMR
for issuance  of  ‘health  booklets’  and  ‘smart  cards’  to  the  affected
persons.  They also prayed for adoption of a common  referral  system  among
various medical units under BMHRC and under  the  BGTRRD  so  that  the  gas
victims are referred  to  the  appropriate  centres  for  proper  diagnosis,
investigation and treatment in terms of the  nature  and  degree  of  injury
suffered by each one of them and also in terms of therapeutic  requirements.
  They also prayed that NIREH be directed to set up completely  computerized
and  centrally  networked  Central  Registry,  to  maintain  proper  medical
records of all gas victims,  to  streamline  and  intensify  epidemiological
studies among the gas-affected population and to prepare treatment  protocol
for treating each category of ailment that the gas  victims  are  suffering,
such  as  respiratory  diseases,  eye-related  diseases,   gastro-intestinal
diseases,  neurological  diseases,  renal  failure,   urological   problems,
gynaecological problems, mental disorders, etc.

</p><p id="p_18">17.   In other IAs/ replies filed on behalf of  different  parties,  it  has
been pointed out that the Monitoring Committee should have the  jurisdiction
over all hospitals, including  non-governmental  hospitals  and  clinics  in
Bhopal.  They should also  be  vested  with  powers  of  recommending  penal
action against the persons who are found to be defaulting  in  carrying  out
the appropriate treatment or following  the  directions  of  the  Monitoring
Committee from time to time.  It has also  been  prayed  that  the  research
work could be carried out by private laboratories or private research  units
besides  the  research  work  being  carried  on  by  the  ICMR  and/or  its
established unit.  It was also brought out from the record before the  Court
that there is no co-ordination between  the  various  functionaries  dealing
with this tragedy and, in fact, the views of the Advisory Committee are  not
given due weightage by the implementing agencies,  thereby  adding   to  the
suffering and agony of the affected parties.
</p>
<p id="p_19">18.   No doubt, the BMHT was established  for  providing  medical  treatment
and care to  the  gas  victims.   Both  the  Monitoring  Committee  and  the
Advisory Committee, appointed by this Court, had different  earmarked  areas
of their respective operation, though their aim was  common.   The  Advisory
Committee was required to advise as per its expertise on matters  which  the
implementing agencies, i.e., the Trust as  well  as  the  State  Government,
were expected to perform.  On the other hand, the Monitoring  Committee  was
required to oversee the functioning of the research  work  as  well  as  the
timely providing of medical care and treatment to the gas affected  victims.
 Functions of each of  these  bodies  were  sufficiently  and  unambiguously
spelt out in different orders  of  this  Court.   After  submission  of  the
reports by the respective Committees, this Court  had  also  passed  various
directions for the better and improved performance of these units, so as  to
ensure better medical care and requisite treatment to the gas victims.
</p>
<p id="p_20">19.   As we have already noticed, with the passage  of  time  this  disaster
has attained wider dimensions and greater concerns, which require  discharge
of higher responsibilities by all the agencies.  In terms of <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_5">Article  21</a>  of
the Constitution, all the gas victims are  entitled  to  greater  extent  of
multi-dimensional health care, as their sufferings are in no  way,  directly
or indirectly, attributable to them.  It  was,  primarily  and  undoubtedly,
the negligence on the part of  the  Union  Carbide  Ltd.  that  resulted  in
leakage of the MIC gas, causing irreversible damage to  the  health  of  not
only the persons affected but even the children who were still to be born.
</p>
<p id="p_21">20.   The first and foremost question that arises for consideration of  this
Court is as to whether this matter should be kept pending before this  Court
or should it be transferred to an  appropriate  forum,  including  the  High
Court, for a more effective and purposeful management of these  institutions
and to ensure that they satisfactorily serve the purpose of ‘public  service
and benefit’ for which they have  been  constituted.   Various  applications
filed before this Court and reports submitted by the Committees,  as  afore-
referred, are to provide requisite help to the gas victims,  as  it  is  not
possible for the poor  victims  to  approach  this  Court  for  issuance  of
appropriate directions from time to time.  This Court  has  already  ordered
providing of basic requirements and constitution of Advisory  Committee  and
the Monitoring Committee.  While the management of BMHT was  taken  over  by
the Union of India, through Ministry  of  Health  and  Family  Welfare,  the
hospital was  to  run  under  the  direct  control  of  Department  of  Bio-
Technology and Department of Atomic Energy and  subsequently,  the  hospital
was also placed under the control of the Ministry.
</p>
<p id="p_22">21.   In our considered opinion, it  will  be  appropriate  that  day-to-day
directions are passed by a jurisdictional High Court.  Such Court  would  be
in a better position to appreciate the  requirements  of  the  gas  affected
victims as well as to exercise better control over the  functioning  of  the
said Committees and organizations.  Such direct control  would  improve  the
functioning  of  these  units  and  their  inter  and  intra   co-ordination
resulting in better mutual performance.  Therefore, we consider it not  only
desirable but also in the interest of all concerned that this matter  should
henceforth be dealt with by the High  Court  of  Madhya  Pradesh,  Bench  at
Jabalpur.
</p>
<p id="p_23">22.   In addition to the directions issued by this Court from time to  time,
it is also necessary for this Court  to  pass  some  further  directions  to
provide clarity and precision and also to  ensure  effective  implementation
of the various orders which shall remain  an  integral  part  of  this  wide
scheme sought to be enforced for the betterment of the gas victims.  As  far
as the argument that there should be privatization of the research work  and
the Monitoring Committee should  be  empowered  to  have  control  over  all
hospitals where the gas victims may  go  for  treatment,  including  private
hospitals and clinics of Bhopal  is  concerned,  the  same  is  without  any
substance.  We are of the considered opinion that  it  would  neither  serve
the ends of justice nor the interest of the gas victims.  On  the  contrary,
there would be multi-differential research without any  substantive  result.
Furthermore, the Monitoring Committee has been  constituted  by  this  Court
vide its order dated 17th  September,  2004,  with  a  definite  object  and
specifically assigned  functions  and  terms  of  reference.   There  is  no
justification,  much  less  any  need,  for  expanding  the  scope  of   its
functioning  or  bringing   the   private   hospitals/clinics   within   the
jurisdiction of this Empowered Monitoring Committee.   Both  these  prayers,
thus, need to be declined, which we do hereby decline.
</p>
<p id="p_24">23.   Certainly, there are certain other matters which require attention  of
this Court.   Matters  in  relation  to  better  co-ordination  between  the
functioning of the authorities, issuance of  ‘Health  Booklets’  and  ‘Smart
Cards’ to the  gas  victims,  computerization  of  medical  records  of  the
hospitals, taking over of corpus of the BMHT, management of  the  Trust  and
certain matters where the State of Madhya Pradesh has failed to  effectively
accept the recommendations of the Committees, are some of the matters  where
we would have to issue certain further directions.  From the  record  before
us, it appears that the meeting of the  Monitoring  Committee  was  held  on
29th March, 2011. In this  meeting,  the  Committee  proposed  that  further
powers be vested in it for improving the quality of medical  care  available
to the Bhopal gas victims.  The proposal of the Committee reads as under :
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">           “The Monitoring Committee for Medical Rehabilitation  of  Bhopal

                  proposed  that  Rs.1,000/-   per   meeting   or   hospital

           would be taken into consideration by the Monitoring Committee.”


</blockquote><p id="p_25">24.   These recommendations of the Monitoring Committee have been  answered
by the State by filing an independent reply.  In this reply,  it  has  been
stated that  the  recommendation  with  regard  to  jurisdiction  over  all
hospitals and clinics is contrary to the terms of the order of  this  Court
dated 17th September, 2004.  The  power  to  receive  complaints  from  the
affected parties has already been permitted.  The Monitoring  Committee  is
also empowered to conduct hearing and collect evidence by requisitioning of
the records and examination of the officers from  various  departments  and
the hospital.  The State also has no objection to the Committee  collecting
the samples of medicines in accordance with the provisions of the Drug  and
<a href="/doc/1891720/" id="a_6">Cosmetics Act</a>, 1940 and the Drug and Cosmetics Rules, 1945.  It is also the
stand of the State Government  that  they  have  implemented  most  of  the
directions issued by the Monitoring Committee.
</p>
<p id="p_26">25.   Another aspect that has been brought to the notice of this  Court  is
that  adequate  space  for  office  of  the  Monitoring  Committee  is  not
available. This makes it difficult for the public to gain accessibility  to
the small space that has been provided by the State to the said  Committee.
This is hampering its functioning in accordance with  the  orders  of  this
Court.
</p>
<p id="p_27">26.   It is commonly conceded  before  us  that  the  corpus  money  stands
completely transferred to  the  Ministry  of  Health  and  Family  Welfare,
Department of Health Research (for short ‘DHR’) and they  have  also  taken
over the management of BMHRC.
</p>
<p id="p_28">27.   Thus, it is necessary for us to deal with the various prayers made in
the above application and the background leading  to  the  filing  of  such
application in its correct  perspective.    We  have  to  take  a  balanced
approach which would further the cause  of  accurate  research  and  better
medical care in favour of the  gas  victims.     The  Union  of  India  has
already passed a resolution directing the ICMR  to  establish  a  permanent
research centre at Bhopal which,  as  already  noticed,  has  already  been
established in the name of NIREH. This itself is sufficiently indicative of
the intent of the Government of India  to  provide  and  procure  necessary
machinery for research related works as well as to further the  process  of
getting much needed scientific manpower and research, which can  contribute
in research activities relating to gas affected persons.
</p>
<p id="p_29">28.    The  Advisory  Committee  is  performing   its   advisory   function
continuously.  Definite replies had been filed on behalf of  the  State  of
Madhya Pradesh and the Government of India ensuring their full  cooperation
and complete implementation of the recommendations of these Committees,  so
as to provide adequate medical facilities to the affected persons  and  the
completion of the research work.
</p>
<p id="p_30">29.   As already noticed, suggestions made by the Monitoring  Committee  in
its Report dated 29th March, 2011 have been broadly accepted by  the  State
of Madhya Pradesh, except for two of such proposals.   The  reservation  of
the State  Government  on  the  issue  of  assistance  of  non-governmental
organisation and experts from outside in assessing the quality of care  and
research work, appears to be for valid and good reasons.  We wish  to  make
it clear that the recommendations of the Empowered Monitoring Committee, as
afore-mentioned, shall not be deemed to have been accepted by  this  Court,
except where directions in that behalf have  been  specifically  passed  by
this Court in the operative part of this order.
</p>
<p id="p_31">30.   Vide letter dated 12th April, 2012, the ICMR while making a reference
to the order of this Court dated 19th July,  2010  had  informed  that  the
administrative control of  BMHRC,  after  winding  up  of  BMHT,  had  been
transferred to the DHR, Ministry of Health and Family  Welfare,  Government
of India and all other matters,  including  administrative,  financial  and
legal, pertaining to BMHRC would be dealt with by the  DHR.  All  documents
were also admitted to have been  transferred,  except  the  corpus  of  the
Trust.   It was suggested that the Corpus of BMHT with accumulated interest
along with original documents/receipts be transferred to the Secretary, DHR-
cum-DG, ICMR and it was also stated that BMHT had been wound up as per  the
directions of this Court with effect from 19th July, 2010.
</p>
<p id="p_32">31.   The BMHT had been constituted under the  Deed  of  Trust  dated  11th
August, 1998.   Since then, it had carried  on  its  activities  under  the
guidance of the Monitoring Committee, the Advisory Committee and as per the
orders of this Court.   The BMHT was to remain irrevocable  for  all  times
and the Trust Deed was to be construed and have effect in  accordance  with
the Indian laws as per the terms and conditions of the Trust.
</p>
<p id="p_33">32.   In terms of the clauses of this Deed,  initially  the  Trust  was  to
stand possessed of the Trust property and income thereof.  This  possession
was to remain both during and after termination of the said period of eight
years for the purposes and objects stated  therein,  which  primarily  were
related to providing for  infrastructure  of  the  hospital  and  grant  of
medical aid to the poor, without distinction of race, caste or creed to the
gas affected victims.
</p>
<p id="p_34">33.   The accounts  of  the  Trust  had  been  audited  and  the  chartered
accountants submitted their Report dated 15th July, 2011  pointing  out  no
irregularity or objections  to  the  accounts  of  BMHT.  This  Report  was
submitted to the Members of the Governing Body of the BMHT.  In the opinion
of the Chartered Accountants, the balance sheet of the state of affairs  of
BMHT  upto  19th  July,  2010  along  with  accounts  giving  the  required
information, gave the true and fair view and  was  in  complete  conformity
with the  accounting  principles  generally  accepted  in  India.   Similar
remarks have been made in regard to  the  Income  and  Expenditure  Account
wherein an excess of income over expenditure  can  be  seen  for  the  said
period.
</p>
<p id="p_35">34.   It would still be in the interest of BMHT itself,  particularly  when
the management and the corpus of the BMHT  have  been  transferred  to  the
Union of India that the Government agency, besides regularly inspecting the
accounts of the BMHT, also gave their final report for  the  period  ending
July 2010.  The Auditor General of the State of Madhya Pradesh would be the
appropriate authority to inspect the accounts of the  BMHT  regularly  even
when the management and corpus thereof  is  transferred  to  the  Union  of
India.
</p>
<p id="p_36">35.   Having noticed in  detail  the  factual  aspect  of  this  case,  the
suggestions made by  various  applicants,  recommendations  of  the  expert
bodies and keeping in mind the very object for  which  the  present  Public
Interest Litigation was instituted, we are  of  the  considered  view  that
issuance of certain specific directions are inevitably  called  for.  These
orders would be to ensure proper progress and implementation of the ‘Relief
and Rehabilitation programme’ for the penurious gas victims as well  as  to
ensure that  the  research  work  is  result-oriented  and  continued  with
exactitude.  We make it clear that these directions shall be in aid of  the
various orders passed by this Court  from  time  to  time  in  the  present
petition and not in derogation thereto.  In other words, all orders  passed
by this Court with specific reference to the orders mentioned above,  shall
be read mutatis mutandis to these directions and  shall  remain  in  force.
The orders-cum-directions are :
</p>
<p id="p_37">1)    This Public Interest Litigation (Writ Petition (Civil) No.50 of 1998)
       shall stand  transferred  to  the  jurisdictional  Bench  of  Madhya
       Pradesh High Court for better and effective control  in  this  case.
       All applications filed henceforth shall be dealt with  and  disposed
       of by the concerned Bench of  the  High  Court,  in  line  with  the
       various orders  passed  by  this  Court,  so  as  to  ensure  proper
       functioning of the ‘Relief and Rehabilitation Programme’, working of
       the expert bodies and utmost medical care and treatment to  the  gas
       victims.
</p>
<p id="p_38">2)    We request the Chief Justice of the  Madhya  Pradesh  High  Court  to
       ensure that the case is dealt with by a Bench presided over  by  the
       Chief Justice himself or a Bench presided over by  the  senior  most
       Judge of that Court or any other  appropriate  Bench  in  accordance
       with the High Court Rules of that Court or any  special  legislation
       governing the subject in that behalf.
</p>
<p id="p_39">3)    Since the space already provided  appears  to  be  insufficient,  the
       State of Madhya Pradesh is hereby directed to  ensure  provision  of
       proper and adequate office space for the  Monitoring  Committee  and
       the Advisory Committee, to perform their functions effectively.  The
       space so provided should be accessible to public  so  that  the  gas
       victims can  conveniently  approach  the  Monitoring  Committee  for
       redressal of their grievances and difficulties.
</p><p id="p_40">4)    We also direct the State Government to provide proper  infrastructure
       to the Committees in the independent office space  provided  to  it.
       The members would also be entitled to receive Rs.1,000/-  honorarium
       for each effective meeting.  However, no honorarium shall be payable
       on a day when the meeting is adjourned or no effective  business  is
       performed in the meeting of the Committee.
</p>
<p id="p_41">5)    The Monitoring Committee has already been authorised and it is hereby
       clarified that it would hear the complaints and, if  necessary,  can
       even call for the records from the concerned hospital or department,
       record the statements of Government servants  or  employees  of  the
       hospital and make its recommendations to the Government  for  taking
       appropriate steps.  If no action is taken by  the  State  Government
       even upon a reminder thereof, the Committee would be well within its
       jurisdiction to approach the High Court for appropriate  directions.
       We make it clear that the Empowered Monitoring Committee shall  have
       no penal jurisdiction.  It shall discharge  its  functions  strictly
       within the framework of the powers vested and functions  awarded  to
       it  under  the  orders  of  this  Court.  Such  suggestions  of  the
       Monitoring  Committee  shall   be   primarily   recommendatory   and
       reformative in their nature and content.
</p>
<p id="p_42">6)    The Empowered Monitoring Committee shall have  complete  jurisdiction
       to oversee the proper functioning of the hospital,  i.e.,  BMHRC  as
       well as other Government hospitals dealing  with  the  gas  victims.
       This jurisdiction shall be limited to the problems relateable to the
       gas victims and/or the problems arising directly from  the  incident
       or even the problems allied thereto.  We  make  it  clear  that  the
       Empowered Monitoring Committee shall have no jurisdiction  over  the
       private hospitals, nursing homes and clinics in Bhopal.  However, it
       does not absolve the State of Madhya Pradesh and the Medical Council
       of India from  discharging  its  responsibilities  towards  the  gas
       victims who are being treated in private hospitals, nursing homes or
       clinics.  We do expect these authorities to hear the  grievances  of
       the complainants as well as to ensure maintenance of  due  standards
       of treatment in these hospitals, nursing homes or clinics.
</p>
<p id="p_43">7)    We direct the ICMR as well as NIREH to ensure that the research  work
       is carried on with exactitude and  expeditiousness  and  further  to
       ensure disbursement of its complete benefit to the gas victims.   We
       do not permit the research work to be carried out by any private/non-
       governmental institution, except the ICMR and NIREH.
</p>
<p id="p_44">8)    The Government of India has already resolved to establish  the  NIREH
       and carry on the research work, for which it has been  provided  due
       infrastructure. Thus, we see no reason why the research work  should
       not progress at the requisite pace in  all  fields  while  providing
       benefits for proper care and treatment of patients  in  the  various
       hospitals in Bhopal.  We further issue  a  clear  direction  to  the
       Union of India and  the  State  of  Madhya  Pradesh  to  render  all
       assistance, financial or otherwise,  to  ensure  that  there  is  no
       impediment  in  the  carrying  on  of  the  research  work  by   the
       specialized institutions.
</p>
<p id="p_45">9)    The Monitoring Committee must  operationalize  medical  surveillance,
       computerization  of  medical  information,  publication  of  ‘health
       booklets’ etc.  The Monitoring Committee shall also ensure that  the
       ‘health booklets’ and ‘smart cards’ are provided to each gas  victim
       irrespective of where such victim is being treated.  This  direction
       shall apply to all the hospitals run by the Government or otherwise,
       in Bhopal.  We direct the State Government to provide assistance  in
       all  respects  to  the  Empowered  Monitoring  Committee  and   take
       appropriate action against the erring officer/officials in the event
       of default.
</p>
<p id="p_46">             We  also  direct  complete  computerization  of  the   medical
       information  in   the   Government   as   well   as   non-government
       hospital/clinics, which should be completed within a period of three
       months from today.
</p>
<p id="p_47">10)   We are informed that there are large number of vacancies  of  doctors
       and supporting staff in the hospitals and  allied  departments.   In
       the BGTRRD, 80 per cent posts of specialists  and  30  per  cent  of
       doctors are lying vacant.  Some posts are also lying vacant  in  the
       Fourth Grade staff.  Thus, we direct the  concerned  authorities  to
       take appropriate steps in all respects not only  to  fill  up  these
       vacancies but also to provide  such  infrastructure  and  facilities
       that the doctors are not compelled to or prefer to resign from BMHRC
       employment  and  its  various   departments,   due   to   inadequate
       facilities.
</p>
<p id="p_48">11)   The Union of India, the State Government and  the  ICMR  should  even
       consider the proposal for providing autonomy to BMHRC and even  make
       it a teaching institution so as to provide attractive terms, studies
       and job satisfaction therein.  This will not only help in  providing
       better opportunities  of  employment  but  would  better  serve  the
       purpose of providing care and treatment of high quality to  the  gas
       victims.
</p>
<p id="p_49">12)   It is indisputable that huge toxic materials/waste is still lying  in
       and around the factory of Union Carbide Corp. (I)  Ltd.  in  Bhopal.
       Its very existence is hazardous to health.  It needs to be  disposed
       of at the earliest and in a scientific manner.  Thus, we direct  the
       Union of India and the State of Madhya  Pradesh  to  take  immediate
       steps for disposal of this toxic waste lying in and around the Union
       Carbide factory, Bhopal, on the  recommendations  of  the  Empowered
       Monitoring Committee, Advisory Committee and the  NIREH  within  six
       months from today.  The disposal should be strictly in a  scientific
       manner which may  cause  no  further  damage  to  human  health  and
       environment in Bhopal.  We direct  a  collective  meeting  of  these
       organizations to be held along with the Secretary to the  Government
       of India and the Chief Secretary of  the  State  of  Madhya  Pradesh
       within one month  from  today  to  finalize  the  entire  scheme  of
       disposal of the  toxic  wastes.   The  above  direction  is  without
       prejudice to the appropriate orders or directions  being  issued  by
       the court of competent jurisdiction.
</p>
<p id="p_50">13)   The Advisory Committee, the Monitoring and the NIREH  shall  continue
       to file their respective quarterly reports before the High Court  of
       Madhya Pradesh.  These reports shall be dealt with  and  appropriate
       directions be passed by the High Court in accordance with law.
</p>
<p id="p_51">14)   We have already noticed that the management of BMHT has already  been
       vested in the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare,  Government  of
       India and the working of BMHT has come to an end. We,  thus,  direct
       that the Union of India and the State of Madhya Pradesh  shall  take
       appropriate  steps  to  ensure  the  dissolution  of  the  Trust  in
       accordance with law. The BMHT was initially formed for a  period  of
       eight years and then was constituted for an indefinite period  under
       the orders of this Court.  In the facts  and  circumstances  of  the
       case and the subsequent events, we  direct  that  BMHT  shall  stand
       dissolved.  All concerned to take  steps  in  accordance  with  law,
       under which it was created and/or registered.
</p>
<p id="p_52">15)   The corpus of BMHT has already been ordered to be transferred to  the
       Government of India and  would  remain  under  the  control  of  the
       Ministry of Health and Family  Welfare.   If  any  other  steps  are
       required to be  taken,  they  shall  immediately  be  taken  by  the
       concerned Ministry.  We further issue a clear direction that all the
       Fixed Deposit Receipts, RBI Bonds, Short Term Deposits and the  bank
       balance of the BMHT, Bhopal, shall stand transferred  and  be  under
       the control of the said Ministry.  If any steps even in this  regard
       are  required  to  be  taken,  we  direct  all  concerned  to   take
       appropriate steps.
</p>
<p id="p_53">16)   Accounts of BMHRC and the allied departments,  as  far  as  they  are
       subject matter of the present writ petition, shall be audited by the
       Principal Accountant General (Audit), Madhya Pradesh.  It shall also
       examine the accounts and the audit  report  dated  15th  July,  2011
       submitted by <a href="/doc/11594248/" id="a_7">M/s. V.K. Verma and Company</a> within  three  months  from
       today.
</p>
<p id="p_54">17)   We also direct the State Government and the Monitoring  Committee  to
       evolve a methodology of common referral system amongst  the  various
       medical units under the erstwhile BMHRC and BGTRRD  to  ensure  that
       the gas victims are  referred  to  appropriate  centres  for  proper
       diagnosis and treatment in terms of the nature and degree of  injury
       suffered by each one of them.
</p>
<p id="p_55">18)   We also direct that the Monitoring Committee, with  the  aid  of  the
       Advisory Committee, NIREH and  the  specialized  doctors  of  BMHRC,
       issues a standardised protocol for treating each category of ailment
       that the gas victims may be suffering  from.   This  shall  be  done
       expeditiously.  It will be highly appreciated if the Committee  also
       prescribes scientific categorization of patients and injuries.
</p>
<p id="p_56">19)   Lastly, we direct all concerned in  the  Union  of  India,  State  of
       Madhya Pradesh, Empowered Monitoring Committee, Advisory  Committee,
       ICMR, NIREH,  BMHRC  and  all  other  Government  or  non-government
       departments/ agencies involved in the implementation of  Relief  and
       Rehabilitation Programme and research activity,  to  carry  out  the
       above directions expeditiously and without demur  and  default.   We
       grant liberty to the applicants and/or the petitioners or any  other
       affected person to move the High Court of Madhya Pradesh,  Bench  at
       Jabalpur, in the event of violation, non-compliance  or  default  of
       any of the above directions or  any  other  orders  passed  by  this
       Court.
</p>
<p id="p_57">36.   Before we part with this matter, we consider it our duty to place  on
record our appreciation for the able assistance  rendered  by  the  learned
counsel appearing for the respective parties and the functions performed by
the various Chairpersons and Committees constituted under the orders of the
Court, including the Bhopal Memorial Hospital Trust.
</p>
<p id="p_58">37.   This writ petition is transferred to the High Court of Madhya Pradesh
in the above terms.  All applications are disposed of accordingly.
</p>
<p id="p_59">38.   Keeping in view the provisions  and  scheme  of  the  <a href="/doc/91685705/" id="a_8">National  Green
Tribunal Act</a>, 2010 (for short the ‘NGT Act’) particularly <a href="/doc/1942704/" id="a_9">Sections 14</a>,  <a href="/doc/331561/" id="a_10">29</a>,
<a href="/doc/1428076/" id="a_11">30</a> and <a href="/doc/1538800/" id="a_12">38(5)</a>, it can safely be concluded that the environmental issues  and
matters covered under the NGT Act, Schedule  1  should  be  instituted  and
litigated before the National  Green  Tribunal  (for  short  ‘NGT’).   Such
approach may be necessary to avoid likelihood of conflict of orders between
the High Courts and the NGT.  Thus, in unambiguous terms,  we  direct  that
all the matters instituted after coming into force of the NGT Act and which
are covered under the provisions of the NGT Act and/or in Schedule I to the
NGT Act shall stand transferred and can be instituted only before the  NGT.
 This will help in rendering expeditious and  specialized  justice  in  the
field of environment to all concerned.
</p>
<p id="p_60">39.   We find it imperative to place on record a caution for  consideration
of the courts of competent jurisdiction that the cases  filed  and  pending
prior to  coming  into  force  of  the  NGT  Act,  involving  questions  of
environmental laws and/or relating to any of the seven  statutes  specified
in Schedule I of the NGT Act, should also be dealt with by the  specialized
tribunal, that is the NGT, created under the provisions  of  the  NGT  Act.
The Courts may be well advised to direct transfer of such cases to the  NGT
in its discretion, as it will  be  in  the  fitness  of  administration  of
justice.
</p>
<p id="p_61">40.   Normally, we would have even transferred this case to NGT.   However,
as it does not involve  any  complex  or  other  environmental  issues  and
primarily requires administrative supervision for proper execution  of  the
orders of the Courts, we have considered it appropriate  to  transfer  this
case to the  High  Court  of  Madhya  Pradesh.   We  may  notice  that  the
supervisory work concerns itself with regard to the proper  functioning  of
the various Committees, which were constituted  under  the  orders  of  the
Court, to  ensure  proper  running  of  the  hospital  established  by  the
government and health care facilities available to the Bhopal Gas  victims.
Thus, the matter should be heard and supervisory jurisdiction be  exercised
by the High Court to better serve the ends of justice.
</p>
<p id="p_62">41.   The Registry is directed to transmit the records of the Writ Petition
No. 50/1998 to the Madhya Pradesh High Court, Bench at Jabalpur,  forthwith
and also send copies of this order to all concerned quarters of  the  Union
of India, the State  of  Madhya  Pradesh,  the  Monitoring  Committee,  the
Advisory Committee, ICMR, BMHRC and  the  NIREH  for  compliance  of  these
directions without delay and default.
