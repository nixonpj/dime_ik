misconduct within the meaning of Para 4 (2) and 19 (h) &amp; (m) of

the Standing orders governing the conduct of the DTC

employees.
</p>
<p id="p_4">

</p><p id="p_5">3.        A charge sheet was issued to the respondent and

then a detailed oral enquiry was conducted . The respondent

was given full opportunity to defend his case.       The Depot

Manager to whom the disciplinary authority were delegated ,

issued a show cause notice dated 25.06.92 to the respondent

asking him to show cause as to why he should not be removed

from service.   The respondent submitted the reply but it was

not found convincing . Therefore , the disciplinary authority

removed the respondent from service vide order dated

31.08.92. On the same day one month's wages were remitted

to the respondent by way of money order and the present

application under section 33 (2) (b) of the <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_1">Industrial Disputes

Act</a> was filed by the management for seeking approval of its

action.
</p>
<p id="p_6">

</p><p id="p_7">4.        The respondent filed the Written Statement alleging

therein that he was appointed by the General Manager of the

petitioner/applicant and as such the Depot Manager was not

empowered to act as disciplinary authority . He availed leave

without pay and, therefore, did not commit any irregularity or

misconduct. The enquiry officer did not correctly recorded the

proceedings. Full one month's wages were not remitted along

with the order of removal from service.
</p>
<p id="p_8">

</p><p id="p_9">5.        On these allegations of the parties , a preliminary

issue was framed on 13.09.93 in the following manner:-

</p><p id="p_10">          Whether the applicant held a legal and valid

enquiry against      the   respondent     according      to   the

principles of natural justice?

its evidence on misconduct.

held that the management had remitted one month's full wages

by way of money order to the respondent on the day of his

removal from service . It was held that the Depot Manager was

competent to issue the order of removal of workman from

service . However my Learned Predecessor found that since

the period of absence has been treated as leave without pay , it

did not amount to any misconduct.

</p><p id="p_15">9.        The    management      challenged    the    order    dated

18.11.99 by way of writ petition bearing no. 7215/00 in the

Hon'ble High Court.    The Hon'ble High Court vide order dated

02.09.05 accepted the writ petition and remanded the case

back to this Tribunal with the directions to decide the matter in

accordance with the law as laid down in the case titled as DTC

Vs. Sardar Singh reported as AIR 2004 SC 4161 after giving

opportunity to the parties as per law.

to the parties to lead evidence as directed by the Hon'ble High

Court.

himself in support of his case as RW1.        He admitted that he

did not attend his duties for 152 days from January 1991 to

November 1991 . He however has submitted that he had sent

applications for leave for his sickness and the sickness of his

wife . He denied that no applications had been sent for 135

days . He also stated that he did not know if his applications for

17 days were rejected because it was submitted late.       He also

submitted that he has not performed his duties for 163 days

during the year 1990 and he has denied that he has not sent

the leave applications for 154 days.     He admitted that during

the year 1988 he had remained absent for 63 days with effect

from January to June 1988 for which he was punished with

stoppage of next due two increments without cumulative effect .

He has also admitted that he again remained absent from

13.10.88 to 28.11.88 for which , he was again punished with

stoppage of next two increments with cumulative effect .



</p><p id="p_20">12.       I have heard the Learned Authorized Representative

for the management.       I have also gone through the written

submissions filed on behalf of workman.

</p><p id="p_21">13.        From the evidence of Sh. Sunder Singh RW1 , it

stands proved that he did not attended his duties for 152 days

for the period of January 1991 to November 1991 . He has

alleged that he had sent applications for all the 152 days of his

absence.     However the record produced on behalf of the

management shows that no applications was received for 135

days and application received for 17 days were rejected as they

were submitted late.     The workman has failed to prove his

contention that he had sent applications for leave for all the 152

days along with medical certificates.

</p><p id="p_23">14.      In the case of DTC Vs. Sardar Singh reported

as AIR 2004 SC 4161          it has been held that "When an

employee absents       himself from      duty, even      without

sanctioned leave for very long period, it prima facie shows

lack of interest in work . Para 19(h) of the Standing Order

as quoted above relates to habitual negligence of duties

and lack of interest in the Authority's work . When an
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                 8              O.P. No. 396/1992</span>

employee absents himself, from duty without sanctioned

leave the Authority can , on the basis of the record, come

to a conclusion about the employee being habitually

negligent in duties and an exhibited lack of interest in the

employer's work . Ample material was produced before the

Tribunal in each case to show as to how the concerned

employees were remaining absent for long periods which

affect the work of the employer and the concerned

employee was required at least to bring some material on

record to show as to how his absence was on the basis of

sanctioned leave and as to how there was no negligence.

Habitual absence is a factor which establishes lack of

interest in work . There can not be any sweeping

generalization . But at the same time some telltale features

can be noticed and pressed into service to arrive at

conclusions in the departmental proceedings.

</p><p id="p_24">         The relevant paragraphs of the Standing Orders

read as under:

</p>
<p id="p_27">(i) An employee shall not absent himself from his

  duties   without       having   first    obtained       the

  permission      from     the    Authority         or    the

  competent officer except in the case of sudden

  illness. In the case of sudden illness he shall

  send intimation to the office immediately. If the

  illness lasts or is expected to last for more than

  3 days at a time, applications for leave should

  be duly accompanied by a medical certificate,

  from a registered medical practitioner or the

  Medical Officer of the DTS. In no case shall an

  employee       leave     station        without        prior

  permission .

           his service with the Organisation .

</p><p id="p_35">           Habitual absence is a factor which establishes lack of

interest in work . There can not be any sweeping generalization

. But at the same time some telltale features can be noticed and

pressed into service to arrive at conclusions in the departmental

proceedings.
</p>
<p id="p_36">             Great emphasis was laid by learned counsel for

the respondent-employee on the absence being treated as

leave without pay. As was observed by this Court in State

of Madhya Pradesh Vs. Harihar Gopal (1969)(3) SLR 274)

by a three judge Bench of this court , even when an order

is passed for treating absence as leave without pay after

passing an order of termination that is for the purpose of

maintaining correct record of service. The charge in that

case was , as in the present case, absence without

obtaining leave in advance. The conduct of the employee in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                                   12                O.P. No. 396/1992</span>

this case is nothing but irresponsible in extreme and can

hardly be     justified. The    charge in this case was

misconduct by absence. In view of the Governing Standing

Orders unauthorized leave can be treated as misconduct .

</p><p id="p_37">         Conclusions regarding negligence as lack of

interest can be arrived as by looking into the period of

absence, more particularly, when same is unauthorized.

Burden is on the employee who claims that there was no

negligence and/or lack of interest to establish it by placing

relevant material. Clause (11) of Para 4 of the Standing

Order   shows      the   seriousness     attached    to   habitual

absence. In Clause (1) therefore, there is requirement of

prior permission . Only exception made is in case of

sudden illness. There also conditions are stipulated, non-

observance of which renders the absence unauthorized.



</p><p id="p_38">14.      It   is   therefore   evident    that   the      workman

remained absent unauthorizedly for 152 days during the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                               13            O.P. No. 396/1992</span>

period of January 1991 to November 1991 and this act of

the workman amounts to misconduct.              The past

conduct of the workman also shows that he had

remained absent unauthorizedly during the year 1988

and 1990 for which also , he was punished .      The past

conduct of the workman also shows that he is not taking

interest in the work of the corporation. I therefore, hold

that the workman has committed the misconduct and the

penalty of removal from service is justified.           The

application of the management is therefore allowed and

approval required under <a href="/doc/1774629/" id="a_2">section 33</a> (2) (b) of the

<a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_3">Industrial Disputes Act</a> is granted to the management.
