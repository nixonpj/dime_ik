                     COMMON JUDGMENT

        Petitioners herein have filed three petitions separately
under     <a href="/doc/136948773/" id="a_1">Section   166</a>     of   Motor   Vehicles     Act,   claiming
compensation from the respondents on account of the injuries
sustained by them in vehicular accident.
</p>

<p id="p_5">        2. The averments of the petitions are that on 28-06-2016 at
about 12.00 p.m., the petitioners were returning to Bengaluru in
a car bearing No.KA-01-ML-9761. When the car reached near
Nalluru Gate, its driver drove the same rashly and negligently
and dashed against an on coming motorcycle bearing No.KA-
01-EA-7658. Due to the impact, the petitioners sustained severe
injuries and took treatment in various hospitals. Prior to the
 3                    (SCCH-16)                MVC 7930/2016 to
                                                  7932/2016




accident, they were hale and healthy and were earning money
for their livelihood. But, on account of the accidental injuries,
they have become permanently disabled and thereby lost
earning capacity. Therefore, the respondents are liable to pay
compensation jointly and severally.
</p>

<p id="p_6">      3. Both respondents appeared before the Tribunal
through their respective advocates. The first respondent has
filed separate written statement resisting the claim of the
petitioners. It has not denied the issuance of the insurance
policy and its validity as on the date of accident. But, it has
admitted the occurrence of the accident involving the offending
vehicle and sufferance of the injuries by the claimants. But, it
has denied the actionable negligence attributed to the driver the
said vehicle. It has contended that the accident has happened
due to the sole negligence of the petitioners themselves as they
were disturbing the driver by talking to him. Further, it has
contended that at the time of accident, the car driver did not
possess valid and effective driving licence and thus there is
breach of terms and conditions of the policy. Therefore, its
liability is to be absolved. On these grounds, it has prayed for
the dismissal of the petitions.
</p>

<p id="p_7">      4. The second respondent also has filed written statement
admitting the fact that he is the owner of the offending vehicle.
So also he has admitted the accident involving his vehicle at the
relevant point of time. But, he has denied the negligence

attributed to the driver in causing the accident. His defence is
that the insurance company is liable to indemnify him in case
the accident is proved to have happened because of driver's
negligence since there was valid driving licence and insurance
policy. For these reasons, he has prayed to dismiss the
petitions.

</pre><blockquote id="blockquote_14">      8. For the sake of convenience these issues are taken up
together for common discussion.</blockquote>


<p id="p_11">      9. Second respondent is admittedly the owner of the car
which is allegedly involved in the accident. He has admitted
the occurrence of the accident and also involvement of his
vehicle therein. Likewise, the insurance company also has
admitted these facts. Thus, there is no dispute with regard to
the occurrence of the accident at the relevant point of time and
place. What is in dispute is in respect of the actionable
negligence only. Therefore, I would like to find out as to due to
whose fault the accident has happened.
</p><pre id="pre_3"> 7                    (SCCH-16)                 MVC 7930/2016 to
                                                   7932/2016




</pre><p id="p_12">      10. All the petitioners have given oral evidence
reiterating the entire averments of their respective petitions. In
support of their versions, they have placed reliance on the
police documents. On perusal of the documents it is seen that
based on the complaint given by one Srikanth, Mulbagal Police
have registered a case against car driver and after due
investigation they have filed charge sheet also. The filing of the
charge sheet prima-facie establishes that the car driver was at
fault. But, the respondents have disputed the negligence on the
part of driver of the car. According to them, the claimants
themselves are responsible for the accident. But, the second
respondent has not challenged both oral and documentary
evidence to prove his contention.
</p>

<p id="p_13">      11. On the other hand, the insurance company has cross-
examined PW1 at length. Despite cross-examination, it could
not cull out anything to show that the accident has happened
because of the sole negligence of the claimants. The driver of
the car is the best person to speak whether the claimants were
disturbing him or not. But, he is not examined. Under such
circumstances, the defence set up by the insurance company
cannot be believed. Even if it is conceded that the claimants
were talking with the driver, no negligence can be attributed to
them, because while driving any vehicle the driver is not
supposed to talk with anybody. If the driver of this case was
not talking with the claimants, the accident would not have
occurred. Therefore, I come to the conclusion that viewed from
 8                    (SCCH-16)                   MVC 7930/2016 to
                                                     7932/2016




any angle the car driver is solely responsible for the accident.
As such, I answer issue No.1 of all the cases in the affirmative.
</p>

<p id="p_14">      ISSUE No.2 of all the cases: (MVC 7930/2016)
</p><p id="p_15">      12. The wound certificate (Ex.P3) reveals that this
petitioner has sustained left eye post traumatic lid tear with
corneal tear and iris prolapse. For these injuries he was taken
conservative treatment in Prabha Eye Clinic and Research
Center for a period of 2 days. PW1 has stated in his evidence
that at the time of accident, he was aged about 21 years and
student of Master in Diploma in CADD at EDUCAAD Learning
Solutions Private Limited. Though it is pleaded that the
petitioner has suffered permanent disablement, the doctor is
not examined and disability certificate is not produced. Under
these circumstances, it is impossible to believe that he has any
kind of disability. Therefore, the question of loss of future
income due to disability does not arise.
</p>

<p id="p_16">      13. He has produced 15 medical bills as per Ex.P10
totally amounting to Rs.18,251/-. All those bills have been
examined with care and found correct. There is no evidence to
disbelieve the genuineness of those bills. Since this petitioner
has sustained injury to eye lid, this Tribunal feels it necessary to
award global compensation. Accordingly a sum of Rs.50,000/-
is awarded to the petitioner. In view of the decision of the
Hon'ble Supreme Court reported in 2013 AIR SCW 5375, he is
entitled to interest at 9% per annum.

other injuries all over the body and took treatment in Magnus
Health Care and Research Center. Further, she has stated that
prior to the accident she was hale and healthy and home maker
and due to the accidental injuries, she has become permanently
disabled. But, she has not produced wound certificate or
discharge summary. Moreover, she has not tendered for cross-
examination   despite   several   opportunities    were   given.
Consequently, her evidence has been discarded. Since her
evidence has been discarded, the petition has to be dismissed.
Under such circumstances, she does not become entitled to

evidence has been discarded, the petition has to be dismissed.
Under such circumstances, he is not entitled to claim any
compensation. As such, issue No.2 of MVC 7932/2016 is
answered in the negative.
</p>

<p id="p_20">      Liability:
</p><p id="p_21">      16. It is an admitted fact that the offending vehicle has
been insured with first respondent and at the time of accident,
the insurance policy was valid. No evidence is adduced by the
insurance company to show that the terms and conditions of
the policy have been violated by second respondent. Likewise,
no material has been produced by the insurance company to
substantiate that at the time of accident, the driver of the car
did not possess valid driving licence and thereby the terms and
conditions of the policy have been breached. On the other
hand, the charge sheet filed by the police also does not show
that Section 3(1) of IMV Act has been invoked. Under such
circumstances, both respondents being the owner and insurer
of the offending vehicle are under obligation to pay the
compensation to the petitioner jointly and severally. However,
the primary liability is on the first respondent to pay the
compensation. Hence, issue No.2 of MVC 7930/2016 is
answered partly in the affirmative.
