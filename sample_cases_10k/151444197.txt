                       JUDGMENT
</pre>

<p id="p_1">     This complaint is filed by the complainant against

the accused U/Sec 200 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_1">Cr.P.C</a>., r/w Sec 138 of <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_2">N.I. Act</a>.

</p><p id="p_2">     02.    The case of the complainant in brief is as

under:
</p>
<p id="p_3">     The complainant, his brother Nandish and the

accused are family friends. Since May 2010 the accused

repeatedly approached complainant and his brother for

financial assistance by way of hand loan to improve and

expand his provision store, security agency business

and also to meet his family necessities and also to

discharge his legal liabilities, personal debt etc., and

promised the complainant and his brother that he

would repay the same sooner. The complainant and his

brother having appreciated the need of the accused for

financial   assistances   with   regard   to   close   family
           (SCCH-3)        3              CC 18018/13


friendship, his social status, both complainant and his

brother altogether have paid Rs.4,00,000-00 by way of

cash to the accused at complainant's residence. In the

month of December 2012 the complainant and his said

brother repeatedly demanded for repayment of the

aforesaid hand loan, the accused went of postponing

the same on one or other pretext and requested to

extend another three months. On 19-12-2012 the

accused once again acknowledges the receipt of the said

hand loan and towards discharge of said existing

liability accused issued two account payee post dated

cheques   bearing   Nos.651623,    651624   both    dated

23-03-2013   for    a   sum   of   Rs.2,00,000-00   each

respectively drawn on Syndicate Bank, Yelahanka

branch, Bengaluru, requesting the complainant to

present the said cheques on or after     date mentioned

therein, so that he would make necessary arrangements

for honouring said cheques. Along with said cheques

accused has also executed two On demand promissory

notes" and "Receipt acknowledgment-cum-repayment
            (SCCH-3)        4             CC 18018/13


agreement" both dated 19-12-2012 in favour of the

complainant. When complainant presented the said

cheques for encashment on 23-03-2013 through his

banker, the said cheques were returned dishonoured on

26-03-2013 with an endorsement "Funds Insufficient".

Thereafter complainant got issued statutory Notice

dt:20-04-2013 calling upon the accused to repay the

amount mentioned in the cheques and same have been

duly served on the accused and delivery of the same has

been confirmed through online track result available at

the website of India Post. Hence, this complaint.

</p><p id="p_4">     03.   After registration of the complaint, sworn

statement of the complainant was recorded and as there

were prima facie materials to proceed against the

accused, a criminal case was ordered to be registered

was ordered to be issued to the accused. In response to

the summons issued, accused has appeared through

his counsel and got enlarged on bail.

</p><p id="p_6">        04.   Substance of accusation was recorded and

read over to the accused. Accused has pleaded not

guilty and claimed trial.
</p>
<p id="p_7">        05.   During the course of trial, the complainant

got examined as P.W.1 and also examined his brother

Nandish and one witness as P.W.2 &amp; P.W.3 and got

marked documents at Ex.P.1 to Ex.P.22.

</p><p id="p_8">        06.   Statement of the accused was recorded

                                                for the following:</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_6">                               REASONS


</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_7">     10.       Point No.1:- It is the case of the complainant

that in response to the hand loan availed by the

accused        for    Rs.4,00,000-00,        accused   issued   two

cheques for Rs.2,00,000-00 each in favour of the

complainant and when said cheques were presented for

encashment by the complainant through his banker,

said cheques were returned dishonoured for "Funds

Insufficient". Thereafter inspite of issuance of legal
            (SCCH-3)         7           CC 18018/13


notice accused failed to pay the amount covered under

the dishonoured cheques.</blockquote><p id="p_11">

</p><p id="p_12">     11.   In order to substantiate the complaint

averments, the complainant got examined as P.W.1

and also examined his brother Nandish as P.W.2 and

one more witness as P.W.3. In their affidavit evidence

P.W.1 to P.W.3 have reiterated similar to complaint

averments. In addition to the ocular evidence, P.W.1 to

P.W.3 have relied upon documentary evidence at

Ex.P.1 to Ex.P.22.
</p>
<p id="p_13">     12.   Two original cheques in question marked at

Ex.P.1 and Ex.P.2, likewise Ex.P.6 &amp; Ex.P.7 are On

Demand promissory notes respectively, the signatures

of the accused in Ex.P.1 and Ex.P.2 are also marked at

Ex.P.1(a) and Ex.P.2(a) and likewise the signatures of

the accused in Ex.P.6 &amp; Ex.P.7 are marked as

Ex.P.6(a) &amp; Ex.P.7(a) respectively.

</p><p id="p_14">     13.   It is pertinent to note that accused admits

his signature in Ex.P.1, Ex.P.2 &amp; Ex.P.6 &amp; Ex.P.7.

According to Sec.118 of N.I. Act, once the signature of
           (SCCH-3)             8                CC 18018/13


the accused on the cheque is not in dispute and the

cheques    have    been     drawn,       the    same      is    for

consideration.    Further      Ex.P.3,    Ex.P.4    the       Bank

endorsements      shows        that    the     cheques         were

dishonoured for want of "sufficient funds" in the

account of accused. Ex.P.8 is the Legal notice which

shows that it was sent to the accused calling upon him

to repay the amount covered under the cheques.

Ex.P.15   is   Letter   sent    to    Post     Master    by     the

complainant       through       his      counsel        regarding

clarification of service of Speed Post, to which Post

Office has replied as per Ex.P.16 &amp; Ex.P.17, which

discloses that "information delivered on 22-04-2013".

At this stage it is relevant to consider the Judgment

reported in AIR 2010 SC 1898 in a case of Rangappa

V/s Mohan, wherein Hon'ble Supreme Court has held

that in view of Sec.139 of N.I. Act, whenever the

cheque is dishonoured, initial presumption arises in

favour of the complainant that the said cheque was

issued for discharge of legally enforceable debt.
</p><p id="p_15">            (SCCH-3)           9            CC 18018/13


</p><p id="p_16">     14.   Hence, it is clear from the oral testimony of

P.W.1 coupled with Ex.P.1 to Ex.P.17 documents, in

view of Sec.139 of N.I. Act, an initial presumption

raises in favour of the complainant that Ex.P.1 and

Ex.P.2 are issued by the accused in discharge of legally

enforceable debt. Said presumption is rebuttable

presumption. Hence, now it is necessary to consider as

to whether accused has been able to rebut the initial

presumption raised in favour of the complainant.

</p><p id="p_17">     15.   In the case on hand accused beside cross-

examining P.W.1 to P.W.3, has also led his evidence as

D.W.1 and also examined one witness as D.W.2. As per

the defence of the accused he has purchased Indica

Car from one Mahesh by taking the complainant as

mediator and the accused has paid Rs.50,000-00

advance and there was due of Rs.93,000-00 and

towards the said due of Rs.93,000-00 he had issued

two cheques, On demand promissory notes and RC

book to the complainant and has repaid the balance of

Rs.1,10,000-00     to   the       complainant   and   the
            (SCCH-3)        10             CC 18018/13


complainant had not returned the documents except

RC book. That the accused had issued all blank

documents     to   the   complainant    and    now    the

complainant has filed false case by misusing the blank

documents. It is further defence of the accused that he

purchased the Car for one Kum.Vasantha, staff in

their office and RC book is in the possession of said

Vasantha and RC is also changed in her name.

</p><p id="p_18">     16.   It is the specific defence of the accused that,

the contents found in Ex.P.1 and Ex.P.2 do not belong

to him. He however admits the signature found in

Ex.P.1 and Ex.P.2, the cheques in question as well as

the signature found in On Demand promissory notes

and consideration receipts at Ex.P.6 and Ex.P.7

respectively. If at all it was the specific defence of the

accused that the complainant had obtained blank

signed cheques and other blank documents while

acting as a mediator to the Mahesh and the accused

herein in respect of purchase of Car as alleged by the

accused, absolutely there was no hurdle for the
              (SCCH-3)        11              CC 18018/13


accused to cause legal notice in this regard to the

complainant seeking return of those blank cheques

and documents. There was also no impediment on the

part of accused to initiate necessary legal action

against the complainant herein for having misused the

blank cheques and documents in question. But for the

reasons best known to him accused has not ventured

to do so, which inturn leads to an adverse inference

against the accused himself that because he had

issued Ex.P.1 &amp; Ex.P.2 as well as Ex.P.6 and Ex.P.7

voluntarily by filling up the contents therein and

therefore he has not initiated any criminal proceedings

against the complainant.
</p>
<p id="p_19">      17.    It is the case of the complainant that himself

and    his     brother   have     advanced     a    sum   of

Rs.4,00,000-00 to the accused on different occasions

and in support of said contents, P.W.1 has examined

his brother Nandish as P.W.2 and also the witness to

the   On      demand     promissory    notes       by   name

Nanjundamurthy as P.W.3 respectively. P.W.1 in
           (SCCH-3)         12            CC 18018/13


addition to his ocular evidence has relied upon

Passbook of his brother and himself at Ex.P.18 and

Ex.P.19 respectively to show that he has paid part of

the loan amount to the accused through account. The

witnesses examined on behalf of the complainant have

identified their signatures in On demand promissory

notes   which   are   marked at Ex.P.6(c), Ex.P.6(d),

Ex.P.7(c) &amp; Ex.P.7(d) respectively. P.W.1 to P.W.3 apart

from their ocular evidence, have also relied upon 5

photographs, CD, Photo bill, copy of Balance sheet

issued by Co-operative Society at Ex.P.20 to Ex.P.22.

Accused although denies advancement of loan amount

by the complainant and his brother, but failed to

substantiate his defence. As stated above there was no

prevention for the accused from filing complaint with

regard to misuse of the cheques by the complainant as

and when it came to his knowledge or atleast when he

received legal notice or Court notice. Accused has not

given any explanation in this regard. At this stage I

would rely upon the Judgment reported in 2013(3)
            (SCCH-3)         13             CC 18018/13


KCCR 2223 in a case of Peeranbi Vs Hajimalang,

wherein it is held that when accused does not deny

cheques, it cannot be accepted that cheque was

obtained by the complainant illegally.

</p><p id="p_20">     18. Hence, in view of the principles laid down in

the said Judgment as the accused has not disputed

Ex.P.1 and Ex.P.2 or Ex.P.6 &amp; Ex.P.7 or his signatures

appears    therein,   it   cannot    be   accepted    that

complainant has obtained Ex.P.1 &amp; Ex.P.2 and Ex.P.6

&amp; Ex.P.7 illegally and misused the same.

</p><p id="p_21">     19.   During the course of cross-examination of

D.W.1 by leading his side evidence, he has taken up

another defence that he has not been served with legal

notice issued by the complainant.
</p>
<p id="p_22">     20.   In the instant case complainant has got

marked Legal notice at Ex.P.8, Postal receipts at Ex.P.9

to Ex.P.12 and RPAD returned covers at Ex.P.13 &amp;

Ex.P.14 respectively. As stated above complainant has

also relied upon the Letter sent by him to the Postal

authority seeking clarification of service of notice to the
           (SCCH-3)        14             CC 18018/13


accused as per Ex.P.15 and the Reply notice by the

Postal Department at Ex.P.16 &amp; Ex.P.17 respectively

discloses that "information delivered on 22-04-2013.

The aforesaid documentary evidence coupled with oral

evidence of P.W.1 makes it clear that there is a service

of legal notice on the accused herein. Under such

circumstances, the defence of the accused that he was

not served with legal notice is no more tenable. It is

pertinent to note that it is not the case of the accused

in specific terms that accused had no financial

capacity to lend the amount covered in the cheque or

that accused had no occasion to borrow said quantum

of loan from the complainant. It is the only defence of

the accused that Ex.P.1 and Ex.P.2 are misused by the

complainant which also leads to an adverse inference

that he had infact availed loan of Rs.4,00,000-00 from

the complainant whatever defence taken by him has

been taken only for the sake of defence without any

force in it. Accused has not made any attempt to elicit
            (SCCH-3)       15            CC 18018/13


any worth materials from P.W.1 to P.W.3 to disbelieve

their version.
</p>
<p id="p_23">     .     In view of all the above discussions, I am of

the opinion that the accused has failed to rebut the

presumption raised in favour of the complainant U/Sec

139 of <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_7">N.I. Act</a>. Therefore, I am of the opinion that

complainant has proved Ex.P.1 and Ex.P.2 were issued

by the accused in discharge of legally enforceable debt.

Hence, Point No.1 is answered in the Affirmative.

</p><p id="p_24">     20.   Point No.2:- As discussed and held in Point

No.1, Complainant has proved that Ex.P.1 and Ex.P.2

Cheques were issued by the accused in discharge of

legally enforceable debt and the said cheques were

dishonoured. It is also discussed and held under Point

No.1 that inspite of issuance of legal notice by the

Complainant as per Ex.P.8, accused refused to claim

the notice and also failed to repay the amount covered

under Ex.P.1 and Ex.P.2. Therefore, taking all these

aspects into consideration and materials on record,

Point No.2 is answered in the Affirmative.

     .     Point No.3:-        The basic ingredients of

</pre><p id="p_25"><a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_8">Section 138</a> and statutory procedure to be followed

prior to filing the complaint alleging the said offence,

are as hereunder:
</p>
<p id="p_26">      (a) The Cheque should have been presented
to the bank within 6 months from the date on which
it is drawn or within the period of its validity,
whichever is earlier;
</p>
<p id="p_27">     (b)   The presented cheque should have been
returned dishonored for the default of the accused;

</p><p id="p_28">      (c)  The payee or the holder in due course of
the cheque, as the case may be, makes a demand for
the payment of the said amount of money by giving a
notice in writing to the drawer of the cheque, within
30 days of the receipt of information by him from the
bank regarding the return of the cheque as unpaid;

</p><p id="p_29">      (d)  The drawer of such cheque fails to make
the payment of the said amount of money to the
payee or, as the case may be, to the holder in due
course of the cheque within 15 days of the receipt of
the said notice;
</p>
<p id="p_30">      (e)   The payee or the holder in due course of
non payment of amount covered under the
dishonored cheque, shall present the complaint
within 30 days from the date of expiry of grace period
of 15 days from the date of notice, to the court.


</p><p id="p_31">     .     In the instant case, Ex.P.1 and Ex.P.2

cheques are dated 23-03-2013, the said cheques was

presented by the complainant to his banker for
           (SCCH-3)         17            CC 18018/13


encashment and the said cheque returned dishonored

for want of sufficient funds on 26-03-2013, then the

complainant issued legal notice to the accused on

20-04-2013 as per Ex.P.8, accused even thereafter

failed to repay the amount covered under Ex.P.1 and

Ex.P.2, hence, the     complainant    filed the    present

complaint on 30-05-2013. Hence, it is clear that Ex.P.1

and Ex.P.2 has been presented to the bank within 6

months from the date of the said cheques, which was

returned dishonored, and hence, complainant issued

legal notice to the accused from the date of intimation of

such dishonor, even thereafter accused failed to repay

the   amount and therefore, complainant           filed the

complaint before the court, within 30 days from the

date of expiry of grace period of 15 days from the date of

notice. As such, complainant has complied all the basic

ingredients and statutory procedure as provided under

<a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_9">Section 138</a> of N.I. Act, prior to filing the present

complaint. Therefore, Point No.3 is answered in the

Affirmative.
