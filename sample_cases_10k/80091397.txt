</p>

<p id="p_10">9.     Before proceedings further, it must be noted that as on the date of filing of the
petition, both the minor children were in the custody of the respondent. Learned
predecessor directed the respondent to produce both the minor children in the
Court. They were produced by the respondent. The learned predecessor interacted
with the minor child Jai Kumar in the chamber on 13.10.2010. In the proceedings
dated 13.10.2010 learned predecessor noted that master Jai Kumar appeared to be
well developed and properly taken care of. He was aged 6 years at that time and did
not have any adverse feelings toward his mother. Thereafter the petitioner met the
minor children in the court and interacted with them. On 1.11.2010 Learned
predecessor handed over interim custody of both the children to the petitioner till
2.11.2010. On 2.11.2010 the matter was adjourned to 8.11.2010 and minor children

GUARDIANSHIP PETITION No.25/2010                                           Page No. 5/8
 were permitted to remain in the custody of the petitioner. On 8.11.2010 the matter
stood adjourned with the minor children remaining in the custody of the petitioner.
</p>

<p id="p_11">10.    Along with the petition, an application had been filed by the petitioner under
<a href="/doc/368948/" id="a_17">Section 12</a> of the Act seeking interim custody of the minor children.           The said
application was disposed of vide order dated 27.11.2010 permitting the petitioner to
retain custody of both the children till final disposal of the matter. She was however
directed to produce both the children on all the dates of hearing to enable them to
meet the respondent - their father.
</p>

<p id="p_12">11.    Thereafter the respondent moved an application under <a href="/doc/368948/" id="a_18">Section 12</a> of the Act
for visitation rights. The said application was disposed of on 18.8.2011 with the
following directions:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">       "1.Respondent shall produce the minor children Master Jay Kumar and
       Ms.Bhumika two days in a month on first and third Saturdays between
       03.00 pm-05.00 pm in this court to enable the respondent to interact with him.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">       2.Respondent shall pay Rs.300/- per date of visitation to the petitioner to bear
       her transport expenses.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">       3.First day of visitation shall commence on 20.8.2011."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_13">12.    In this manner, the minor children have remained in the custody of the
petitioner since 1.11.2010. Before posting this matter for final arguments, this court
directed the petitioner to produce both the children before this court to ascertain their
wishes. On 2.3.2013 the petitioner produced both the children in the Court. Master
Jai Kumar had attained the age of 8 years while baby Bhoomika was aged 3 yrs 9
months by then. Master Jai Kumar was found to be able to form an intelligent
preference while baby Bhoomika was unable to do so. Master Jai Kumar expressed
unwillingness to live with the respondent.
</p>

<p id="p_14">13.    Arguments were addressed by the learned counsel for the parties on the lines
of averments made in the pleadings. From the evidence on record it stands
established that the petitioner left the matrimonial home on 22.12.2009 and has not
returned since then.     Both the minor children were left in the custody of the


GUARDIANSHIP PETITION No.25/2010                                            Page No. 6/8
 respondent by the petitioner although she has claimed that the respondent snatched
away the children from her.     The respondent and his family members are accused
in two criminal prosecutions initiated by the petitioner and are facing trial. The
respondent works from 10.00 am to 7.00 pm Tuesday through Sunday. As per the
respondent he is earning Rs.3,000/- per month. The respondent though resides in
his own house but live separately from his parents, younger brother and sister in law
He does not have good relations with his parents or his brother and sister in law.
The respondent has not examined any other member of his family who was willing to
take care of the children in his absence at home. It is thus clear that the respondent
is not in a position to look after minor children personally on account of his
employment.
</p>

<p id="p_15">14.    Both the children are of tender age. While master Jai Kumar is currently aged
8 years, baby Bhoomika is aged 4 years. The other minor child master Jai Kumar
has been found to be able to form an intelligent reference and he has expressed his
unwillingness to reside with the respondent-his father.
</p>

<p id="p_16">15.    <a href="/doc/1994601/" id="a_19">Section 6</a> (a) of the Hindu Minority and <a href="/doc/76168618/" id="a_20">Guardianship Act</a> 1956 provides that
ordinarily custody of a minor who has not completed the age of five years shall be
with the mother.     <a href="/doc/1889483/" id="a_21">Section 17</a> (1) of the Act reiterates that while appointing or
declaring the guardian of a minor, the Court shall be guided by what appears in the
circumstances to be for the welfare of the minor child. <a href="/doc/1889483/" id="a_22">Section 17(3)</a> of the Act
further provides that if the minor is old enough to form intelligence preference the
Court may consider such preference. <a href="/doc/1284729/" id="a_23">Section 13</a> (1) of the Hindu Minority and
<a href="/doc/76168618/" id="a_24">Guardianship Act</a>, 1956 also provides that in the appointment or declaration of any
person as guardian of a Hindu minor by a Court, the welfare of a minor shall be the
paramount consideration. In the case of Shyamrao Maroti Korwate Vs. Deepak
Kisanrao Tekam reported in (2010) 10 SCC 314, the Hon'ble Supreme Court was
pleased to hold that in such matters, it is not the rights of the parents or relatives but
the interest of the welfare of the minor which of paramount consideration.
</p><p id="p_17">16.    It is therefore settled law that it is not the rights of the parties or parents but

GUARDIANSHIP PETITION No.25/2010                                             Page No. 7/8
 interest and welfare of the minor which is of paramount importance and that if the
minor is old enough to form an intelligence preference the Court may consider such
preference. The minor child Jai Kumar has been found able to form an intelligent
preference. He has clearly expressed his unwillingness to reside with the
respondent. The respondent does not have any person to look after the minor
children when he goes for work. The petitioner is unemployed and has sufficient time
for upbringing of the minor children. Baby Bhoomika being less than five years of
age and being female ought to have in the custody of the petitioner-her mother. In
these circumstances, the petition is allowed, and the petitioner is permitted to retain
custody of both the minor children.
</p>

<p id="p_18">17.    However, the respondent being father has a right to meet his children and is
therefore entitled to visitation rights. This petition is thus being disposed of with the
direction to the petitioner to produce the minor children master Jai Kumar and baby
Bhoomika for visitation of the respondent on first and third Saturday of every month
at Karkardooma Courts for a period of two hours from 3.00 p.m. to 5 p.m. to enable
the respondent to meet them. The respondent shall be entitled to bring eatables
and gifts for the minor children on such visitations.   File   be   consigned    to   the
Record Room.</p><pre id="pre_2">
