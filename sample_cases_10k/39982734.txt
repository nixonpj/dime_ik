                          The instant application has been filed by the
                    appellants, who were arraigned as defendant nos. 62
                    to 66 in the partition suit, seeking dispensation of
                    service of notice of appeal upon the other defendants,
                    who did not contest the partition suit in the Trial
                    Court.
</p><p id="p_6">                          Mr.     Pratip    Kumar    Chatterjee,       the    learned
                    Advocate, appears on behalf of respondent no. 1 and
                    submits that he lodged a caveat for the said
                    respondent and, therefore, the service of notice of
                    appeal     may    be    dispensed      with     upon     the    said
                    respondent.
</p><p id="p_7">                          In    course     of   hearing    it    appears     that   the

                    who filed the suit for partition of the joint property.
                    We,      therefore,     direct   Mr.        Chatterjee    to     file
                    Vakalatnama for the rest of the plaintiffs within two
                    weeks from date.

                    appeal upon them is dispensed with at the risk of the

     This is an application for stay of all further
proceedings in Partition Suit No. 142 of 2002 pending
before the learned Civil Judge (Senior Division), 2nd
Court, Berhampore, District - Murshidabad, till the
disposal of the instant First Appeal.
</p><p id="p_11">     Mr. Chatterjee, who appears for the first plaintiff,
submits that an application has been taken out by the
plaintiffs before the Trial Court for further preliminary
decree, as some of the properties, which were the joint
properties,   were   not   included   in   the    impugned
preliminary decree. The said application is pending
and has not been disposed of.
</p><p id="p_12">     There is no difficulty in passing more than one
preliminary decree in a partition suit and, therefore,
we do not find any justification in keeping the appeal
in abeyance till the disposal of the said application.
The prayer made in the instant application, if allowed
in its entirety would have an impact on the progress of
the said application or further steps to be taken before
the suit ultimately reaches to the stage of final decree.
</p><p id="p_13">     The instant application is thus disposed of in the
following manner:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">     1)        The application for further preliminary
               decree filed by the plaintiffs shall be
               proceeded with and the Trial Court
               shall not keep the said application in
               abeyance, as the First Appeal against
               the first preliminary decree is pending
               before this Court.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">     2)        The    Trial   Court   shall      proceed   to
               appoint the partition commissioner,
               who shall complete the commission
               work pending disposal of the instant
               First Appeal but no final decree shall be
               drawn up till the disposal of the instant
               appeal.</blockquote>
<p id="p_14">     Let the Lower Court Records be called for by
Special Messenger at the cost of the appellants. Such
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                                          3</span>




 cost shall be deposited by 7th January, 2019.
</p><p id="p_15">      Immediately, after arrival of the Lower Court
 Records, office shall examine the same and after the
 same is found complete in all respect shall issue
 notice of arrival of Lower Court Records upon the
 learned Advocate of the appellants.
</p><p id="p_16">      While sending the Lower Court Records the Trial
 Court shall prepare skeleton records for the purpose
 of disposal of the application filed by the plaintiffs as
 well as to complete the commission work as indicated
 above.
</p><p id="p_17">     The appellants are directed to prepare and file
 requisite number of informal paper books - printed,
 typewritten or cyclostyled, as the case may be - out
 of court, within a month from the date of service of
 notice of arrival of Lower Court Records on the
 learned Advocate for the appellant.
