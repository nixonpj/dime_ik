PRESENT :
       THE HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE BISWANATH RATH
</pre><p id="p_1">---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date of hearing :7.02.2018                            Date of Judgment :7.02.2018
</p><p id="p_2">---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
</p>
<p id="p_3">Biswanath Rath, J.                           This         civil   miscellaneous           petition
involves a challenge to the order vide Annexure-3 passed by the
learned Civil Judge (Senior Division), Bhadrak in Civil Suit
No.146/2014-I thereby allowing withdrawal of the suit at the
instance of the plaintiff.
</p>

<p id="p_4">2.                Short background involved in this case is that the
petitioner claiming to be one of the legal heir of the defendant no.1
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                    2</span>



in the court below submitted that the defendant no.1 died on
27.6.2014 and during pendency of the application for substitution
in respect of the defendant no.1 at the instance of the plaintiff, the
application under Order 23 Rule 1 of C.P.C. was finalized. As the
suit has already been abated, there was no scope for the trial court
to entertain the application under Order 23 Rule 1 of C.P.C.
</p>

<p id="p_5">3.          Referring to the pleadings in the plaint and the claim
involved therein, Shri Dash, learned counsel for the petitioner
submitted that the legal heirs of the defendant no.1 since are
necessary and proper party, the suit should not have been
permitted to be withdrawn in absence of substitution.
</p><p id="p_6">      Also referring to a decision of this Court, in the case of
Sri Sri Shyam Ray alias Shyamsundar jew Thakur versus
Haramani Dei (dead) and after her, Jinet Samal &amp; others as
reported in 56(1983)C.L.T.503 learned counsel for the petitioner
contended that for the ratio decided therein, the decision has direct
application to the case of the petitioner. Similarly, referring to
another decision in the case of Tirtha Bararty and 9 others
versus Dingar Kanda and 7 others as reported in 2017 (II) OLR-
242 further submitted that in absence of substitution of the
defendant no.1 in the case at hand following the principle laid down
in the above reported case, the suit had already got abated leaving
any scope for considering the application under Order 23 Rule 1 of
C.P.C. It is under these premises, learned counsel for the petitioner
submitted that the impugned order becomes bad and needs to be
interfered with and set aside.
</p>

<p id="p_7">4.          Shri Rout, learned counsel for the contesting opposite
party nos.1 to 2 taking this Court to the pleadings involving the
plaint and the prayers made therein submitted that the suit being
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                     3</span>



directed for a decree only as against the defendant no.2, death of
defendant no.1 becomes immaterial and therefore, learned counsel
for the opposite parties contended that there is no infirmity in
passing the impugned order as the suit was very much existing on
the date of disposal of the application under Order 23 Rule 1 of
C.P.C. Further answering to the claim of the learned counsel for the
petitioner based on two judgments, it is contended that none of the
decision has any application to the case at hand.
</p>

<p id="p_8">5.          Considering the rival contentions of the parties and on
perusal of the copy of the plaint involving C.S. No.146I of 2014 this
Court finds, not only the pleadings involved therein relates to a
claim only involving the defendant no.2 but there is also specific
prayer in the suit seeking a declaration to the effect that the
registered sale deed no.10271300208 dated 22.1.2013 in the name
of defendant no.2 as void and illegal. It is for the specific pleading
and for the specific prayer in the suit, this Court declines to
entertain the claim of the petitioner that the suit got abated for the
non-substitution of the defendant no.1.
</p>

<p id="p_9">6.          Now coming to scan the decision relied on by the
learned counsel for the petitioner. Scan of the decision reported vide
56(1983)C.L.T.503 this Court finds,       the fact involved therein
involving death of a necessary party. Under the observation that the
relief claimed in the suit since has a bearing involving the defendant
no.2 and without substitution of defendant no.1 the suit got abated,
this Court considering the fact involved in the case at hand, finds,
there was no relief sought for as against the defendant no.1 and the
suit was involving the claim pertaining to the defendant no.2 only.
As a consequence, this Court observes, this decision rather helps
the case of the opposite parties.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                     4</span>



<p id="p_10">      Similarly, considering the other decision vide 2017(II)OLR-
242, for the observation of this Court made hereinabove that the
suit was surviving for the relief involved therein on the date of
consideration of the application under Order 23 Rule 1 of C.P.C.,
this decision has no application to the case of the petitioner.
</p>

<p id="p_11">7.          Perused the impugned order. For the recordings and
the observations of this Court made hereinabove as well as for the
support of the decision as reported in 56(1983) C.L.T.503 to the
case of the opposite parties, this Court finds, there is no infirmity in
the impugned order. Accordingly, the Civil Miscellaneous Petition
stands dismissed. No cost.
