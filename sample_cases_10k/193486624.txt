<p id="p_1">Harsimran Singh Sethi, J.(Oral)

             In the present writ petition, the grievance which is being raised

by the petitioner, who is the son of Smt. Kamlesh Kapoor, is that the

benefits for the service, which his late mother had rendered with respondent

No. 4-School, have not been released to the legal heirs and further after the

death of his mother in the year 2002, no family pension was released to the

father of the petitioner, who also, unfortunately, died on 03.01.2009, hence

petitioner is entitled for the said amount as well.

</p><p id="p_2">             Learned counsel for the respondents states that the claim, which

is being raised by the petitioner is against respondent No. 4-School, which

is run by the Private Management. Learned counsel states that though the

school is aided but the present writ petition is not maintainable keeping in

titled as Management of S.D. Model Senior Secondary School &amp; another

Vs. District Judge-cum-Service Tribunal and another, 2014 (1) S.C.T.

652, as all the disputes between the employee and the management are to

be adjudicated upon by the Educational Tribunal at the first instance. The

relevant paragraph of the judgment passed by the Division Bench is as

under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">                  "23. In view of the above discussion, we concluded as
                  under:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">                  (i) That an Educational Tribunal constituted in terms of
                  the direction of the Supreme Court in T.M.A Pai
                  Foundation's case (supra), will not have the jurisdiction
                  to decide issue of payment of gratuity, as the same is
                  payable to the teaching and non-teaching staff in terms
                  of the <a href="/doc/553799/" id="a_1">Payment of Gratuity Act</a>, 1972.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">                  (ii) In respect of second question, the notification of the
                  State Government constituting Educational Tribunal will
                  include all service disputes arising out of an order
                  passed by the Management, as appealable to the
                  Educational Tribunal. Such right to appeal is not arising
                  in view of the judgment in T.M.A Pai Foundation's case
                  (supra), but in exercise of the executive powers of the
                  State.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">                  (iii) The State Government shall consider appropriate
                  amendments in the Haryana School Education Act, 1995

counsel for the petitioner states that the record of this case be sent to the

Educational Tribunal, Ambala for passing an appropriate order on the plea,

counsel for the petitioner further states that as the petition is already

pending for the last three years before this Court, some timeframe should be

fixed for disposal of the present case.

placed before the Educational Tribunal, Ambala for appropriate order(s) on

</p><p id="p_8">             Keeping in view the fact that the petitioner is seeking the

benefits in respect of service rendered by his late mother, who expired in the

year 2002, the Educational Tribunal, Ambala is directed to pass appropriate

orders on the claim of the petitioner as expeditiously as possible.
