                  the   order    bearing   memo    No.   357   dated   23.1.2004

                  passed    by     the     Engineer-in-Chief         placed     at

(E)     dated       19.10.1981            also     passed        by     the     same

authority,          placed       at        Annexure-2           to      the     writ

petition whereby a recovery of Rs. 3,84,285.67 has

been     directed         against           the        petitioner,         to     be

recovered          from        his        salary        and/or         from      his

pensionary entitlements.

<p id="p_4">             Brief       facts       of    the     matter         is    that     the

petitioner was appointed as a Junior Engineer and

Officer,          Warsaliganj,            Gaya     where        he     joined     on

21.9.1964.          The       petitioner          was     transferred            and

posted       in    the    Sub-Divisional               Road       Construction,

Sub-division,             Mohania,             where       he         joined      on

16.9.1974.           The petitioner remained in the said

Sub-Division until 14.9.1978.                           During the posting

of     the    petitioner             at    Sub-Division,               Mohania     a

physical verification of the stocks was conducted

and a loss of stocks to the tune of Rs. 5,45,109.94

was     reported         by    the        Auditors.             The     loss     was

attributed          to     8     officers          and       of        which     the

petitioner         was    attributed             with     alleged        loss     of

Rs.     3,84,285.67.             Following             the      audit     report,

impugned office order bearing memo No. 3142 (E)

dated     19.10.1981           came        to     be    issued         under     the

signature          of the respondent Engineer - in - Chief

Department, Government of Bihar, Patna.                          The order

stipulated, a recovery at the rate of Rs. 200/-

from the salary of the persons named in the said

order and in case any of them got superannuated,

the balance amount was to be recovered from his

gratuity and his movable/immovable properties.

</p><p id="p_6">            The order of recovery though was passed on

19.10.1981,        the        petitioner     did    not    question         the

same before any appropriate forum.                       Learned counsel

for the petitioner submits that the petitioner had

been        representing            the     authorities          in        this

connection and with reference to a letter bearing

No.450       dated       25.10.1981         of     the    Sub-Divisional

Officer,          Public        Works       Department          placed        at

Annexure-3 of the writ petition, submits that in no

uncertain         terms       the    Sub-Divisional         Officer          had

pointed      out     that      there      were     no    loss    of    stocks

outstanding in the name of the petitioner.                            Learned

counsel with reference to another letter bearing

No.    2259       dated       28.12.1981         (Annexure-6)         of     the

Executive Engineer, Building Construction Division,

Sasaram addressed to the Engineer-in-Chief, submits

that    the       said    fact      was     also    intimated         to    the

Engineer-in-Chief, that the loss of stocks held out

against the petitioner were not during his tenure.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                         4</span>




In the     circumstances guidelines were asked as to

whether the deduction at the rate of Rs. 200/- per

month had to be carried out from the salary of the

petitioner or not.
</p>
<p id="p_7">          Admitted          position     is      that     the      deductions

were     never     carried         out        and       the        petitioner

superannuated from the post of Assistant Engineer

with effect from 30.9.2001.                   It is two years after

superannuation,             that   for      the      first          time    the

petitioner       chose        to   assail           the       order        dated

19.10.1981 (Annexure-2) by filing a writ petition

bearing C.W.J.C. No.               4566 of 2003.                   During the

pendency of the said writ petition the recovery was

effected from the gratuity and the leave encashment

entitlements of the petitioner and evidence whereof

is   placed   at    Annexures          11     and    12       of    the    writ

petition.
</p>
<p id="p_8">          In the said proceeding a counter affidavit

was filed on behalf of the State and in which a

stand was taken that the petitioner had never taken

any steps for modifying or withdrawal of the order

of   recovery      as       contained       in    Annexure-2,          either

before the Engineer-in-Chief or any other authority

superior to him.            The Bench hearing the matter took

notice    of the fact that the said statement of the

respondents was not controverted by the petitioner
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                    5</span>




in his rejoinder nor any document was placed on

record of the proceedings to controvert the same.

</p><p id="p_9">        In the said circumstances the writ petition

was   disposed     of        by       order           dated        6.8.2003

(Annexure-13) in the following terms.

</p><pre id="pre_2">                 "Under          such       circumstances,               this
          Court    finds         it   difficult         to     grant      any
          relief       to    the        petitioner           as     against
</pre><p id="p_10">          Annexure-1.             However, having regard to
          the     letters         issued         by    the        Executive
          Engineer          to        the         Engineer-in-Chief,
          contained         in    Annexure-5,           and       also    the
          letter       of    the      Sub        divisional        officer
          referred therein, this court considers it
          expedient          to       dispose          of      the       writ
          application            with    a       direction         to     the
          Engineer-in-Chief(respondent No.2) to re-
          examine the grievance of the petitioner
          and dispose it of afresh by a reasoned
          order        within           two        weeks          of      the
          receipt/production                of    a     copy      of     this
          order."
</p>
<p id="p_11">
        The Bench even while disposing of the writ

petition was pleased to hold that it was difficult

to grant any relief to the petitioner as against

Annexure-1, meaning thereby no fault was found in

the order of recovery as contained in Annexure-1.

The said conclusive finding by the writ Court was

never assailed by the writ petitioner.                        The second
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                          6</span>




part of the order required the Engineer-in-Chief to

consider the grievance of the petitioner in the

backdrop     of     the          letter     of     the       Sub-Divisional

Officer and the Executive Engineer which is placed

at     Annexure-3        and        Annexure-6          of    the     present

proceedings.
</p>
<p id="p_12">           The representation filed by the petitioner

upon     disposal       of        the    writ     petition         placed   at

Annexure-14 to the writ petition, also does not

provide any explanation as regarding the loss of

stocks attributed to him.                       The Engineer-in-Chief

upon consideration of the issue in the backdrop of

the order of the writ Court placed at Annexure-13

of   the   writ     petition,            was     pleased      to    pass    the

impugned     order       dated          23.1.2004       as    contained      in

Annexure-1 holding that no substantial proof had

been put forth by the petitioner for exonerating

him of the liability and in which background there

was no requirement of modification or rectification

of   the    order    dated          19.10.1981          as    contained      in

Annexure-2.         It       is    in    this     background        that    the

present writ petition came to be filed.

</p><p id="p_13">           Learned       counsel         for     the    petitioner      while

assailing the validity of the order as contained in

Annexures-1       and        2     submits       that    the       petitioner

having     superannuated            with    effect       from      13.9.2001,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                     7</span>




any adjustment/requirement could only be effected

within    the   confines    of   Rule       43(b)   of    the      Bihar

Pension    Rules.         Learned     counsel       submits         that

admittedly no proceedings had been drawn by the

authorities for effecting the recovery in question

by following the procedure as envisaged under the

Rules. He thus submits that the recovery effected

without following the due process of law cannot be

sustained.      Learned     counsel       in    support       of     his

submissions relied upon the following decisions

the petitioner, were precluded from effecting the

same until such time that a proceeding under Rule

43   (b)   was    drawn    against     the    petitioner.          He

submits    that    the    provisions    of    the    Rules    in   no

uncertain    terms       provides    that    no     adjustment     or

recovery can be made from either                   the pension or

even   gratuity       of    the     petitioner,        until       the

proceedings aforesaid are formally drawn.                    He thus

submits that as no proceedings had been drawn nor

can be drawn against the petitioner for the reason

that the issue relates to the period 1975-76,                      the

recovery is unsustainable.           Learned counsel further

submits that notwithstanding the aforesaid position

even   the       minimal    procedure        for     effecting      a

punishment of recovery as provided under Rule 55A

of the Civil Services (Classification Control and

Appeal) Rules 1930 has not been followed in the

present case.        He thus submits that where neither

of the procedure as envisaged under Rules has been

followed, the recovery made from gratuity and leave

encashment of the petitioner is unsustainable in

law and thus the petitioner is entitled for refund

thereof.     Learned counsel with reference to the

letter of the Executive Engineer dated 28.6.2003

and the Additional Secretary, Government of Bihar

dated 5.7.2002 placed at Annexure-A of the counter
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                         9</span>




affidavit,        submits      that       even    until      2003,     the

liability had not been crystallized and was in a

nebulous         stage,      which      fact     is     apparent      from

correspondence            entered within the Department.               He

thus submits that in such situation where loss in

the stocks attributed to the petitioner, itself was

in doubt, the recovery effected by the authorities

on the basis of mere suspicion in absence of a

definite conclusion was sustainable in law.

</p><p id="p_20">            Mr.    R.K.     Sinha,      learned       counsel   for    the

State opposes the contentions of the petitioner and

raises an objection regarding the maintainability

of the writ petition, in view of the categorical

finding of this Court on the previous writ petition

preferred by this petitioner placed at Annexure-13

of   the    proceedings.           It    is    submitted     that     this

Court      upon    consideration         of    the    matter    did   not

choose      to    grant      any     relief      to    the   petitioner

against the order of recovery placed at Annexure 1

of the said proceedings and which is Annexure-2 to

the present proceedings and which fact has closed

all doors for the petitioner to maintain a second

writ petition.              He submits that the issue stood

concluded in so far as the validity of the order of

recovery          dated       19.10.1981          (Annexure-2)         is

concerned.         He     submits       that   the     matter   was   re-
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                      10</span>




examined by the Engineer-in-Chief in the light of

the directions of the Court and the Engineer-in-

Chief upon consideration of the materials available

on record came to a conclusion that the impugned

order    required    no   modification    nor   cancellation.

He submits that the letter of the Sub-Divisional

Officer and the Executive Engineer was examined and

considered by the Engineer-in-Chief while disposing

of the claim of the petitioner, vide order dated

23.1.2004 placed at Annexure-1.             He submits that

the writ petition was barred on the principles of

res-judicata    as    the   issue   stood   concluded.    He

further submits that the petitioner has slept over

the matter for the period of 20 years and his claim

not having found favour by the writ Court on the

earlier occasion required no consideration and the

writ petition was fit to be dismissed on this count

above.    It is further submitted that the liability

was identified on the basis of the audit report,

taken note in the order dated 19.10.1981 of the

Engineer-in-Chief (Annexure-2) and it was the duty

of the petitioner to have explained the situation.

Learned counsel for the State submits that there is

nothing on the records of the proceedings nor in

the     representation      filed    on     behalf   of   the

petitioner placed at Annexure-14 which explains the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                         11</span>




loss of stocks shown against him.                       Learned counsel

thus    submits        that    the    claim      set     forth      by    the

petitioner does not merit consideration and is fit

to be dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_21">           Learned       counsel      for        the     petitioner         in

response to the contention advanced on behalf of

the respondents submits that the order as contained

in     Annexure-1       is    not     in    consonance           with     the

directions of this Court placed at Annexure-13 to

the    writ     petition.        He    submits         that     a   perusal

thereof does not in any manner demonstrate whether

the letters of the Sub-Divisional Officer and the

Executive Engineer taken note of by this Court in

the     order     as     contained         in        Annexure-13,         were

considered by the Engineer-in-Chief while disposing

of the claim of the petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_22">           Learned counsel for the Accountant General

submits that the stand of the petitioner that in

absence of a proceeding under the Pension Rules, no

recovery      could      be   effected      from        his    pensionary

benefits, is completely misplaced and misconceived

for the reason that it is only in circumstances

where    the     person       concerned         is    guilty     of      grave

misconduct       or      causing      pecuniary          loss       to     the

Government that such proceeding is envisaged.                              He

submits       that     the     loss    of        stock     was      already
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                        12</span>




identified        under       the        impugned        order         dated

19.10.1981 (Annexure-2) and that the recovery from

pensionary entitlements of the petitioner was only

a consequence of the said order.

<pre id="pre_3">          I     have    heard       learned       counsel        for    the

respective       parties     and       perused    the    materials       on

record.        A perusal of the order passed by the writ

</pre><p id="p_23">Court in the writ petition earlier preferred by

this petitioner giving rise to C.W.J.C. No. 4566 of

2003    dated     6.8.2003        is    very     clear     and     in    no

uncertain terms manifests that the petitioner was

not found entitled to any relief as against the

order     of     recovery      dated      19.10.1981           placed    at

Annexure-1 of the said writ petition and Annexure-2

to the present proceeding.                The relevant portion of

the order has already been reproduced in this order

and does not require any further eloquence.                             The

order of the writ Court is conclusive on the issue

of      Annexure-2          and        sitting      in         coordinate

jurisdiction I shall not interfere with the same.

The    petitioner      never      assailed       that    part     of    the

order    of     the   writ   Court       and     thus    the    same    has

become final and conclusive on the said issue.

</p><p id="p_24">          Having held as such I do not consider it

appropriate to deal with the issue whether or not

the respondents were within their jurisdiction to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                         13</span>




effect the recovery without following the procedure

as envisaged under Rule 43(b) of the Rules.                               Even

otherwise the responsibility having been identified

20 years prior to the retirement of the petitioner,

who never bothered to challenge the same before an

appropriate       forum,           the   recovery        effected        after

retirement        of        the      petitioner          is    merely       an

implementation of the order of recovery and does

not     require        an     independent         proceeding.              The

judgments      cited          by     learned         counsel       for    the

petitioner relates to recovery without initiation

of any proceeding.                  The case in hand is              on an

entirely different footing. In the present case,

the order of recovery had already passed though not

acted    upon.         The     belated        implementation        of    the

order of recovery would not grant a premium to the

petitioner to assail the same on the anvil of the

provisions of the Bihar Pension Rules.                         That brings

us to the order as contained in Annexure-1 of the

writ     petition       disposing            of   the     claim     of    the

petitioner       with        the    finding       that    there     was    no

requirement for modification or cancellation of the

order dated 19.10.1981.
</p>
<p id="p_25">          On perusal of the order of the writ Court

placed    at     Annexure-13,            I    find    that     a   specific

direction had been issued to the Engineer-in-Chief
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                       14</span>




to consider the grievance of the petitioner in the

backdrop       of    the    letter     of     the   Sub-Divisional

Officer       (Anneuxre-3         herein)   and     the   Executive

Engineer (Annexure-6 herein).                 I find that though

the Engineer -in-Chief has referred to the said

letters but there is apparently no finding either

accepting or rejecting the same.
</p>
<p id="p_26">             In the circumstances the order cannot be

said to be in tune with the directions of this

Court.       There are some other documents placed on

the records of the proceedings which demonstrates

that    no    finality      was    attached    to   the   liability

created      under    the    audit     report.      All   that    the

Engineer-in-Chief           has    stated     in    his   order    in

observance of the direction of this Court is that

he has perused the letter(s) and considered the

same.        He however, does not deal with the said

letter and whether the same were issued contrary to

the evidence available on the record. The duty cast

upon the Engineer -in-Chief under the directions of

this Court has not been properly discharged.

</p><p id="p_27">             Having regard to the circumstances, I am

unable to uphold the order passed by the Engineer-

in-Chief dated 23.1.2004 placed at Annexure-1 &amp; the

same is set is set aside. The Engineer-in-Chief is

directed to pass a fresh order in accordance with

                defend himself and dispose of the same in the light

                of the direction passed by this Court in C.W.J.C.

                No.   4566     of    2003   placed   at   Annexure-13,   within

                a copy of this order.
