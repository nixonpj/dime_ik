                  CORAM: HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE JYOTI SARAN
                                        ORAL ORDER</pre>

<p id="p_1">10   26-06-2019                  It is in compliance of the order of this Court that Sri

                    Anjani Kumar Singh, the Engineer-in-Chief, Water Resources

                    Department, Bihar, Patna, Sri Kumar Jayant Prasad, Chief

                    Engineer, Water Resources Department, Siwan, Sri Chandra

                    Mani Baitha, Executive Engineer, Irrigation Division, Raghopur

                    and Sri Dilip Kumar, Director Provident Fund, Bihar, Patna are

                    in attendance. The reason is already discussed in my order dated

                    19.06.2019 as well as the order passed earlier thereto.

</p><p id="p_2">                                 The default by these officers to ensure compliance

                    persuaded me to summon them for drawing charges but it is

                    because Mr. Anjani Kumar, learned Additional Advocate

                    General No.4 appears and takes the responsibility for ensuring

                    the compliance of the order of this Court within next two weeks
 Patna High Court MJC No.578 of 2018(10) dt.26-06-2019
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                            2/3</span>




          that while granting two weeks' time to these officers to ensure

          payment of each and every dues admissible to the petitioners on

          behalf of her husband as well as on her own behalf I waive of

          the attendance of these officers with word of caution that the

          next summon would be for framing of charges.

</p><p id="p_3">                       Mr. Anjani Kumar, Additional Advocate General No.4

          while filing a supplementary show cause on behalf of the

          opposite party no.10 in reference to Annexure 'C' submits that

          though the entire service details of the deceased government

          employee is present there but unfortunately the service book is

          not traceable and thus the Accountant General may be directed

          to process the pension papers of the deceased employee as well

          as the family pension payable to his widow on the basis of the

          details so present at Annexure 'C' which are duly certified by

          the Executive Engineer, Irrigation Division, Raghopur, district

          of Supaul bearing letter No.531 dated 07.07.2018.

</p><p id="p_4">                       Prima facie I do not see any reason why in the

          extraordinary circumstances expressed, the Accountant General,

          Bihar, Patna should have any objection to process and accord

          authorisation on the basis of service details present at Annexure

          'C' by treating it the service book, unless any further

          information is required. Mr. Purushottam Kumar Jha, learned
              Patna High Court MJC No.578 of 2018(10) dt.26-06-2019
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                                          3/3</span>




                       counsel      appearing       for    the Accountant   General,   Bihar

                       appreciating the problem prays for an accommodation to

                       ascertain as to whether any further information would be

                       required for grant of authorisation by the Accountant General.

</p><p id="p_5">                                    Mr. Anjani Kumar, learned Additional Advocate

                       General No.4 further informs that in view of the change in

                       system of payment, the PAN number of the widow would be

                       required. Mr. Sanjeet Kumar, learned counsel appearing for the

                       petitioner undertakes to supply the same to Mr. Anjani Kumar,

                       learned Additional Advocate General No.4 for the needful.

</p><p id="p_6">                                    While directing the opposite parties to complete the

                       entire process within two weeks next, in so far as the issue of

                       service book is concerned, allowing time to Mr. Jha to seek

                       instruction, the matter would come up 'For Orders' on

                       Wednesday next i.e. 03.07.2019.
