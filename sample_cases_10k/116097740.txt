               (ARVIND SAHANI Vs THE STATE OF MADHYA PRADESH)


03-08-2017

      Shri Vinay Singh Baghel, learned counsel for the applicant.
      Shri Arvind Singh, learned Govt. Advocate for respondent-State.</pre>
<p id="p_1">      Heard.
</p><p id="p_2">      This is first bail application filed on behalf of the applicant
under <a href="/doc/1290514/" id="a_1">Section 439</a> of the Cr.P.C.
</p><p id="p_3">      The applicant is in custody since 28.5.2017 in connection with
Crime No.147/2017 registered at Police Station Vindhya Nagar,
District Singrauli (M.P.) for the offence punishable under <a href="/doc/134179606/" id="a_2">Section
34(2)</a> of Excise Act.
</p><p id="p_4">       As per prosecution on receiving information from informer
police of police station Vindhya Nagar searched Tempo No. MP-66-
R/0915 in which 90 bulk litres country made liquor was being being
transported by applicant Arvind Sahani, who was the driver of said
Tempo along with other co-accused Dharmendra Kushwaha, Mukesh
Kumar, Sukhdeo Kushwaha.
</p><p id="p_5">       Learned counsel for the applicant submits that the offence is
triable by Judicial Magistrate First Class and trial will take long time
to conclude. Learned counsel further submits that when the applicant
was driving said tempo along with aforesaid other co-accused, some
persons brought some cartons by Bolero and loaded in that tempo. At
that time search was made and above cartons were seized by the police
from the said tempo which was being driven by the applicant.
Thereafter, the applicant came to know that cartons contained liquor.
He is ready to furnish bail as per the order, abiding with all conditions
imposed by the Court. On these grounds, learned counsel for the
applicant prays for grant of bail to the applicant.
</p><p id="p_6">        Per-contra, learned Govt. Advocate opposes the bail application.
       After hearing arguments of the parties and looking to the facts
and circumstances of the case, despite bar under Section 59-A(ii) of
the M.P. Excise Act and in view of the law laid down in Banshi Lal
Vs. State of M.P., [(2003) 2 MPLJ 369], I am of the considered view
that it would be appropriate to release the applicant on bail, therefore
without commenting on merits of the case, application of the applicant
Arvind Sahani under <a href="/doc/1290514/" id="a_3">Section 439</a> of the Cr.P.C. seems to be
acceptable. Consequently, it is hereby allowed.
</p><p id="p_7">       It is directed that applicant be released on bail on his furnishing
bail bond in the sum of Rs.30,000/-(Rupees Thirty Thousand) with
one surety of the same amount, to the satisfaction of the JMFC
concerned or trial Court for his appearance before them on the dates
given by the concerned Court. It is directed that the applicant shall
comply with the provisions of <a href="/doc/259682/" id="a_4">Section 437(3)</a> of the Cr.P.C.

                                                            JUDGE
