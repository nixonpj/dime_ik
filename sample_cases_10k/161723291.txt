as stated above the accused has taken a specific defense that she is

pertinent to note here that, the complainant has proved the existence

legally recoverable debt.

specific defense that her said husband had availed a sum of

as a security. It is pertinent to note here that, the accused in her said

statement has not stated the number of the said cheque. It is

significant to note here that, from the said conduct of the accused it

appears that it is not her case that her husband had issued in favour



of the complainant the EX.P1 as a security. It is pertinent to note

here that, in absence of any material and cogent evidence the

aforesaid contention and defense of the accused cannot be believed

EX.P1 i.e., P1(a). It is pertinent to note here that, as stated above it

that, from perusal of entire evidence of the complainant and conduct

of the accused it clearly appears that the accused to discharge her

legally enforceable debt had issued in favour of the complainant the

EX.P1. It is pertinent to note here that, the complainant has

convincingly proved that the accused to discharge her legally

enforceable debt had issued in his favour EX.P1 and the accused has

failed to rebut the said contentions of the complainant. It is pertinent
