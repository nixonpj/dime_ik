                 entire matter, to my mind, the present petition for anticipatory bail deserves

                               arrest, the Arresting Officer would admit him to bail on his
                               furnishing adequate bail and surety bonds in the sum of

<p id="p_6">                 5.             At the very outset, on instructions from ASI Parmanand,

                 learned State counsel has acknowledged the relevant factual matrix and

                 submitted that the petitioner has already joined the investigation. He is no

                 longer required for further interrogation, at this stage. There is no history of

                 his previous involvement in any other criminal case. Moreover, all the

                 offences alleged against the accused are triable by the Court of Magistrate.
