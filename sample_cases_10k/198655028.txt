<pre id="pre_1">              HON'BLE SRI JUSTICE C. PRAVEEN KUMAR

                    WRIT PETITION No.44065 OF 2018

ORDER:
</pre>

<p id="p_1">         Heard learned counsel for the petitioner, learned Government

Pleader for Mines and Geology, learned Government Pleader for Home

(A.P).     With their consent, the writ petition is disposed of at the

admission stage.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">         The present writ petition came to be filed seeking issuance of

writ of Mandamus declaring the action of the respondents in seizing

the vehicle of the petitioner bearing Nos.AP-31-TE-6876, without

following procedure of law, as illegal and arbitrary.


</p><p id="p_4">         On   the   allegation   that   the   subject   vehicle   was   found

transporting sand from the unauthorized reaches/without any

permission, during the raid conducted, the officials of the Vigilance

and Enforcement Wing of Mines and Geology department seized the

vehicle and handed over the same to respondent No.3, to keep it in

safe custody.
</p>
<p id="p_5">
</p><p id="p_6">         In identical circumstance, in I.A.No.1 of 2018 in W.P.No.21809

of 2018, this Court passed an interim order on 16.07.2018, directing

release of vehicle on payment of amount and the petitioner therein

carried the matter in appeal, vide W.A.No.1014 of 2018, wherein a

Division Bench of this Court, by order dated 02.08.2018, disposed of

the said Writ Appeal, modifying the order, by directing release of

vehicle upon the appellant furnishing bank guarantee or security.          A

copy of the same is placed on record.          Paragraph Nos.5 to 8 of the

said order reads as under:
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                   2</span><p id="p_7">



</p><p id="p_8">         "5. From a perusal of sub-rule (1) of Rule 9-B, it is clear
   that if the appellants are found guilty of the offence, they are
   liable to pay a penalty of Rs.1,00,000/- apart from the
   confiscation of the vehicle and the imprisonment of the owner.
   In such circumstances, a via media has to be stuck, especially
   while considering an application for an interim order.        The
   learned Judge thought that directing payment of Rs.75,000/-
   per vehicle may be a good interim solution.

</p><p id="p_9">         6. But the contention of the appellants is that ultimately
   if they are proved not guilty, the amount paid by them will
   remain with the respondents without bearing any interest. The
   vehicles cannot also to be allowed to remain with the
   respondents, as they may get damaged due to non-use.

</p><p id="p_10">         7. We think the objections of the appellants are fairly well
   founded.     While the interests of the revenue are to be
   protected, the vehicles of the appellants cannot also be allowed
   to get damaged due to non-use.     Therefore, we are of the view
   that directing the appellants to furnish bank guarantee or
   security for the above amount, may served the ends of justice.

</p><p id="p_11">         8. Accordingly, the writ appeal is ordered modifying the
   order of the learned Judge, directing the respondents to release
   the tractors cum trailers of the appellants, upon the appellants
   furnishing bank guarantee or security to the tune of Rs.75,000
   per vehicle, in favour of the 3rd respondent, viz., the Assistant
   Director of Mines and Geology.     There shall be no order as to
   costs".
</p>
<p id="p_12">      Following the above said Judgment, dated 02.08.2018, passed

by a Division Bench of this Court in W.A.No.1014 of 2018 and for the

reasons recorded therein, there shall be a direction to the

respondents to give interim custody of the vehicle bearing Nos.AP-31-

TE-6876, to the petitioner, subject to production of the relevant

documents, to prove ownership of the subject vehicles, and subject to

furnishing bank guarantee or security to a tune of Rs.1,00,000/-
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                     3</span>


(rupees one lakh only), in favour of the competent authority.   Till the

conclusion of the proceedings/prosecution, petitioner shall also give

an undertaking that he will not alienate the vehicle, will not create

any third party rights, will not remove major parts of the vehicle and

that the vehicle will be produced as and when required during the

course of proceedings.      It is also made clear that this order holds

good till the conclusion of the proceedings/prosecution.    Thereafter,

it is open for the respondents herein to proceed, in accordance with

law.
</p>
<p id="p_13">
</p><p id="p_14">       With the above direction, the writ petition is disposed of. No

order as to costs.
</p>
<p id="p_15">
</p><p id="p_16">       Miscellaneous petitions, pending if any, shall stand closed in

the light of this final order.
</p>
<p id="p_17">                                              _________________________
