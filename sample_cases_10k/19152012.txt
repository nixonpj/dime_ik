<p id="p_4">2. Without               making        any        comment     on    the
complaint/FIR lodged by me, I state on oath
that the said complaint/ FIR was lodged by
me     in      hot        hurry/        haste       and     upon    some
misunderstanding/ misconception.
</p>
<p id="p_5">3. I further state and submit that as such
the undersigned as well as the other side
are residing in the same premises and all
are      blood           relatives          and     therefore       now,
after regarding peace of mind and due to
the intervention/ indulgence of some of the
members             of        the       families/           community/
locality,           both       the     parties       have     realized
that        the      complaints             filed     against       each
other       were         in   haste,        without       considering
the      future          prospects          and     therefore       this
affidavit is affirmed because the lives of
the members of both the families would be
spoiled/ ruined if the impugned complaints
are further carried out and therefore, in
the interest of both the families, coupled
with the fact that some of the petitioners
in both the complaints are relatives and
are related to each other, the dispute is
now resolved and as such the matter is now
amicably            settled         and     hence     as     such    now
there is no heart-burning and any dispute

whatsoever                in       the         said           regard,          the
undersigned               has         no       objection            if      this
Honourable Court exercises inherent powers
vested              in     it        and           if        the     impugned
complaint             /FIR       in      question             filed       by    me

consequential                   proceedings                  thereof           are
quashed by this Honourable Court.
</p>
<p id="p_6">4. I further state on oath that now as such
the       differences                 are          sorted          out,        and
therefore                consent              for         quashing             the
complaints filed by her and the families of
the undersigned as well as the otherside
would life to maintain healthy and vigorous
relations            and       thus,          no    purpose         would       be
served if the complaint would be further
proceeded, followed by initiation of trial
that would ultimately and finally turn to
be     futile            exercise          and      for       quashing         the
impugned FIR may kindly be considered.
</p>
<p id="p_7">5.      In view of the above mentioned facts
and circumstances of the case, the deponent
have no objection if this Honourable Court
may be kind enough to quash and set aside
the        FIR           in      question               filed        by        the
undersigned               being        C.R.         No.I-361         of     2017

amicably resolved the dispute, no useful purpose would now

be served to permit the investigation to continue further.
