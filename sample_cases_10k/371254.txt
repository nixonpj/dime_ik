:ORDER
</pre>

<p id="p_1">	The revision is preferred against the order passed in Crl.M.P. No.349 of
2006 in S.C.No.73 of 2005
</p><p id="p_2">	2. The revision petitioner is Prosecution Witness No.I in S.C.No.73 of
2005 on the file of the learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Ramanathapuram for
offences under sections 366, 368, 376, 387 read with 34and 109<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_1"> of the Indian
Penal Code</a>.
</p><p id="p_3">	3. The charge is that on 27.11.2003, Miss.Persin, the minor daughter of
the petitioner, who was aged 17 years old, was kidnapped by the fourth accused
with the connivance of the other accused and raped by him in illegal custody.
</p><p id="p_4">	4. During the course of investigation of this case, the daughter of the
petitioner was allegedly rescued from the custody of the accused and produced
before the learned District Munsif cum Judicial Magistrate, Rameswaram.  The
custody of the minor girl Persin was entrusted to the petitioner who is the
father of the said girl on condition that the minor girl should be produced
before the court as and when required.
</p><p id="p_5">	5. The learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Ramanathapuram issued a notice
on 18.4.2006 calling upon the petitioner herein to produce the girl for the
purpose of examination as the case is pending for quite a long time for her
examination.
</p><p id="p_6">	6. The petitioner filed Crl.M.P.No.349 of 2006 seeking to withdraw the
aforesaid notice mandating the petitioner to produce his daughter as the
undertaking given by him had lapsed on account of the majority attained by his
daughter Persin.
</p><p id="p_7">	7. The learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Ramanathapuram, having adverted
to the facts and circumstances under which the undertaking was given by the
petitioner to produce the minor as and when called upon by the court, dismissed
the application observing therein that though the daughter of the petitioner has
attained majority, he is bound to produce her inasmuch as the petitioner has not
chosen to relieve himself from such an obligation by producing the minor just
prior to her attaining majority.
</p><p id="p_8">	8. The aforesaid order is under challenge before this court.  The learned
counsel appearing for the petitioner would contend that the undertaking given by
the petitioner stands terminated the moment the minor daughter of the petitioner
has become major. As such, she has every right to go abroad on her own volition.
The petitioner has no control over her on attaining her majority.  He is
incapable of abiding by the undertaking given by him at the time when his
daughter was a minor.  It is further submitted by the learned counsel for the
petitioner that as the minor daughter of the petitioner is now in foreign
country, the petitioner is prepared to bear the entire expenditure for recording
evidence of his daughter by video conferencing. 	
</p><p id="p_9">	9. The learned counsel appearing for the respondents would submit that the
petitioner cannot shirk his responsibility by saying that his daughter has
become major. As he has not chosen to relieve himself from the undertaking given
before the court, he cannot validly contend that he is not able to comply with
the mandates of the court as the person in his custody has become major. He
further contends that the video conferencing facility, which is not available in
the premises of the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Ramanathapuram, cannot also be
effectively utilised. Further his submission is that recording of evidence by
video conferencing has many shortcomings.
</p><p id="p_10">	10. This court, for the effective disposal of this Criminal Revision Case,
sought for a report from the learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Ramanathapuram
as to the availability of video conferencing facility in Ramanathapuram for the
purpose of recording evidence of the daughter of the petitioner.  But, the
learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Ramanathapuram has submitted before this
court through his report that no such facility was available in Ramanathapuram.
Now, it is brought to the notice of this court that such a facility is available
in Madurai.
</p><p id="p_11">	11. Coming to the obligation of the petitioner arisen out of the
undertaking given by him while taking the custody of his minor daughter, the
court finds that the petitioner should have alerted the learned Chief Judicial
Magistrate, Ramanathapuram on the eve of attaining majority by the daughter of
the petitioner herein so as to ensure her appearance before the court without
fail for the Trial of the case.  If the petitioner has sought for discharge from
such obligation even at the time when the daughter of the petitioner was in
India, the Trial Court would have taken some steps  to ensure the presence of
the daughter of the petitioner at the relevant point of time.  Of course, the
daughter of the petitioner is a free bird immediately on attaining majority.
Her shackle is automatically broken the moment she attains majority.  But, as
the petitioner has failed in his duty to inform the court and get himself
relieved of the obligation to produce his daughter before the court, the
petitioner has graduated to the position of a surety who has courted an
obligation to produce his daughter who has since become major.  Having connived
with his daughter in her departure from this country, the petitioner cannot take
a valid contention that he lost  control over his daughter.  Therefore, the
court finds that the learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Ramanathapuram has
rightly directed the petitioner herein to produce his daughter, who by his act
of commission and omission, has become a surety for the appearance of his
daughter.
</p><p id="p_12">	12. Now, the daughter of the petitioner is in Britain.  Her attendance
cannot be procured without an amount of delay, expense or inconvenience. Now,
the petitioner has come forward with a solution for the impasse in the trial on
account of the absence of his daughter.  He is now prepared to shoulder the
entire financial burden that may be caused on account of examination of his
daughter by exploiting video conferencing facility.
</p><p id="p_13">	13. The Honourable Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/560467/" id="a_2">STATE OF MAHARASHTRA v. DR.PRAFUL
B.DESAI</a> (2003 SCC (CRI.) 815) has given green signal for utilising the latest
video conferencing facility for the purpose of recording evidence of course on
certain contingencies and also on complying with certain conditions.
</p><p id="p_14">	14. It is submitted that the daughter of the petitioner is willing to
adduce evidence through video conferencing facility. Great Britain is found to
be a  country having extradition treaty with India.  Under the laws of the said
country, contempt of court and perjury are punishable.
</p><p id="p_15">	15. Therefore, a Commissioner of Oath has to be engaged by the learned
Chief Judicial Magistrate, Ramanathapuram to record the evidence of Miss.Persin,
the daughter of the petitioner herein,  who is in Britain,  by using video
conferencing facility at Madurai.  The accused and/or his pleader shall be
present when the evidence is recorded by video conferencing.  The Commissioner
of Oath appointed by the learned Chief Judicial Magistrate has the discretion to
fix up the time for video conferencing, taking into account the convenience and
inconvenience of the parties concerned.  He shall ensure that the witness in the
foreign shore  is not coached or tutored  or prompted at the time of recording
evidence through video conferencing.  He shall also ensure that the witness in
the foreign shore gives evidence in a room in the Consulate or Embassy of our
country in the foreign shore.
</p><p id="p_16">	16. Therefore, while dismissing the Criminal Revision Case confirming the
order passed by the learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Ramanathapuram, the
latter is directed to appoint a Commissioner of Oath to record evidence of
Miss.Persin, the daughter of the petitioner in S.C.No.73 of 2005 through video
conferencing at Madurai and to submit a report with the deposition recorded in
the light of the aforesaid observation made by this court.  The entire
expenditure involved in recording the evidence through video conferencing in
S.C.No.73 of 2005 shall be borne by  the petitioner herein.  The connected
Miscellaneous Petition is closed.
