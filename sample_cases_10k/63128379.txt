                      Devaraj was working as a driver in the third respondent concern

                      and he has taken a LIC policy under the " Bima Kiran plan" , in

                      Policy    No.700491698,   for   the   value   of   Rs.2,00,000/-     on

                      07.12.1996.     The above policy was taken under the salary

                      recovery scheme and the monthly premium of Rs.180/- was

                      deducted from the salary of the petitioner's husband through his

                      employer, the third respondent, and paid the same to LIC. In the

                      year 1999, he fell in sick due to kidney problem, subsequently,

                      died on 09.02.2001. After his death, there is no intimation from

                      the second respondent regarding the payment of any premium,

                      payable by the petitioner's husband and there is also no

                      intimation from the second respondent regarding lapse of the

                      policy.   In the above circumstances, the petitioner had made a

                      representation to the second respondent to pay the policy

                      amount payable under the above policy. But, the second

                      respondent sent a letter dated 27.08.2001 stating that the

                      premium amount was paid only upto December 1999, subsequent

                      to that, the premium amount was not paid and the policy stands

                      lapsed. As the death has taken place when the policy was in a

                      lapsed condition, nothing is payable to the petitioner by the LIC.

                      Thereafter, the petitioner had sent several representations

                      informing      the   respondents   that   she    did   not   receive    any

                      communication from the second respondent regarding lapse of

                      the   policy    and    sent   number      of   representations     to   the

                      respondents. Since, the petitioner's representation has not been

                      considered, she has come forward with the present writ petition.



</p><p id="p_3">                            3. The respondents 1 and 2 have filed counter affidavit

                      stating that, the policy was lapsed in the year 2000 itself, for

                      non-payment of premium. The policy commenced on 07.12.1996

                      and the term of the policy was 30 years with a monthly premium

                      of Rs.180/- under Salary Saving Scheme and the premium was

                      not paid from January 2000. Since the petitioner's husband did

                      not get any salary from January 2000, premium could not been

                      deducted.    Now it is not open to the petitioner to say that no

                      lapse notice was sent, and the concerning fact was known to the

                      petitioner. Since the policy pertains to the year 2000 records

                      pertaining to default intimation and lapse intimation could not be

                      traced now.      As per the policy condition, the death claim is

                      permissible only if the death occurred within the grace period, if

                      the policy is not in force then the notional paidup value of total

                      premiums paid will be settled as death claim, and the petitioner is

                      not entitled to get the assured sum.       Since the policy has been

                      lapsed and the death has also not occurred within 5 years, the

                      petitioner is not entitled for the relief sought for.

                      denying the claim of the petitioner on the ground that before the

                      death of the petitioner's husband, the policy stands lapsed for

                      non payment of the premium, and, the petitioner is not entitled

                      for the assured amount. Admittedly, the policy was taken under

                      the Salary Saving Scheme and the premium was deducted from

                      the year 1996 from the salary of the deceased through his

                      employer.   The petitioner is the wife of the deceased, and she

                      was not aware whether the premium was paid by the employer or

                      not. Even though it is contended by the respondents that the

                      premium was not deducted from the salary and paid to the

                      respondents-LIC, absolutely, there is no materials available on

                      record to establish the same. The second respondent also stated

                      that the records relating to the policy are not available with them

                      to show that the premium was not paid from the year 2000 and

                      the policy stands lapsed. Assuming that the policy was lapsed,

                      under <a href="/doc/762759/" id="a_2">Section 50</a> of the Insurance Act 1938, the second

                      respondent is bound to issue notice to the policy holder regarding

                      non-payment of the premium. It is not known whether any such

                      that on the date of death of the petitioner's husband, the policy

                      was lapsed, the respondents cannot refuse to pay the assured
