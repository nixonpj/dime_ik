so, there was an occasion with DVB officials to demand and

</p><p id="p_25">9.        Sh. Ritesh Sharma Ld. Counsel for accused

Mukesh Rana contends that the school of the complainant

was having electricity load of 11 KW and the complainant

had applied for additional load of 40 KW on the pretext that

existing connection of 11 KW was meant for the use of

Rohini Educational Society whereas the new connection of

40 KW was required for the use of School of the complainant

and since, two electric connections could not have been

provided at one premises and in the name of one person or

institution , therefore, on 2.8.96 accused had stated that joint

inspection of the site is required before granting the new

connection of 40KW applied for by the complainant and on

7.8.96, a joint inspection was carried out by Sh. R. P. Goel A.

E. (PW10) who had reported that there is no separate

building of society or school and the XEN was requested to

visit the premises of the complainant for necessary advice. It

is pointed out by the defence that by document dt. 20.8.96

Ex. PW7/B, the Chief Engineer Sh. H. R. Bhatia (PW7) had

made it clear that the old connection of 11KW was required

to be disconnected by the complainant as in one premises of

the complainant, second connection cannot be allowed.



</p><p id="p_28">10.       It is further pointed out by the defence that vide

document Ex. PW10/DA,it was made clear by Sh. R. P. Goel

(PW10) that complainant had refused to give in writing for

disconnection of old connection after two days of the

installation of the above said connection i.e. of 40 KW and

so, as per document of the DVB dt. 4.9.96 order for

disconnection of supply to the old connection was passed

and the complainant was found himself to be cornered and

that is why on the same day i.e. on 4.9.96 vide document

Ex. P-5, he had to apply for amalgamation of 40KW load in

the existing load of 11KW and since all this had happened

because of the initial step taken by the accused Mukesh of

requesting for joint inspection of the premises of the

complainant by higher officers, therefore, the complainant

bore a grudge against the accused Mukesh as by

amalgamation of 40KW in the existing load of 11KW , the

total load would have exceeded 50KW , and would have

fallen in the category of High Tension connection (HT

Connection) for which the tarrif was higher and according to

ld. Counsel , this was the reason for false implication of

accused Mukesh Rana.

the prosecution case is motivated and in view of the

Surinder Gupta (PW-8) whereas on the other hand, there is

evidence of DESU official witnesses i.e. of then Chief

R.P. Goel (PW-10). The law was set into motion in this case

on the basis of a complaint dated 7.9.1996 Ex.P-1 made by

Complainant R.N. Jindal (PW-5) to Shri Sahib Singh Verma,

then Chief Minister, Delhi regarding harassment by DESU

(Rohini office) in providing new 40 KW NDLP connection.

The sum and substance of this complaint Ex.P-1 is that in

August 1995 necessary approval for new 40 KW connection

was granted by the competent authority but that was

misplaced in commercial section and again on 1.7.1996

request for providing 40 KW connection was made and the

same was sanctioned by the competent authority on

22.7.1996 and thereafter accused Mukesh Kumar Rana, JE

along with one Mahavir carried out the inspection at site and

after discussion, accused Mukesh Kumar Rana, JE told the

complainant that henceforth accused Mahavir would be

dealing with this matter with him and as per this complaint,

accused Mahavir made a demand of bribe of Rs.40,000/-

and   Rs.10,000/.- out of the said amount was to be paid

initially and the rest after installation of the new connection

and in the meanwhile, complainant contacted Jai Bhagwan,

MLA who advised the complainant (PW-5) to pay bribe of

Rs.10,000/- so that the motive of the DESU officials become

clear.
</p>
<p id="p_56">

</p><p id="p_57">21.       It transpires from the evidence of complainant

(PW-5) that in the presence of his friend Surinder Kumar

Gupta, (PW-8), complainant had given bribe amount of

Rs.10,000/- to accused Mahavir but the complainant is not

able to give the date when he had made the said payment.

Complainant (PW-5) claims that he had told Mehta, XEN in

the presence of MLA Jai Bhagwan (PW-6) about giving of the

bribe.   It has come in the cross-examination of the

complainant (PW-5) that he knew MLA Jai Bhagwan (PW-6)

for the last about fifteen years and he also knew Shri Sahib

Singh Verma, then Chief Minister, Delhi for the last about 25

years and he had been inviting them in the annual functions

of his school. There is evidence of MLA Jai Bhagwan (PW-

</p><p id="p_58">6) which supports the aforesaid version of the complainant

(PW-5). However, there is one major difference in the

evidence of the complainant (PW-5) and that of Jai Bhagwan

(PW-6) i.e.   Jai Bhagwan (PW-6) claims that complainant

(PW-5) had told Shri Mehta, Executive Engineer that

electricity connection already provided to his school was of

low load and as and when high load connection is provided

to the school then the existing electricity connection would

be surrendered.      This is conspicuously absent in the

evidence of complainant (PW-5) as well as in the

FIR/complaint Ex.P-1. In fact, aforesaid issue of surrender of

the old connection is the bone of contention in this case.



</p><p id="p_60">22.       It is matter of record that the existing electric

connection of 11 KW to the school of the complainant (PW-5)

was commercial and the complainant (PW-5) was wanting

new electric commercial connection of 40 KW for his school.

The other set of evidence of official witnesses PW-2, PW-7

and PW-10 makes it clear that it was the policy of DESU

then that if commercial electric connection is already existing,

then second commercial electric connection cannot be

sanctioned. It is evident from the evidence of then Addl.

Chief Engineer Shri G.P. Goel PW-2 that vide his note

Ex.PW2/A, the specific condition was put that second

commercial electric connection can be provided if it is in

different name and in different premises. It is apparent from

the file Ex.PW9/B of DESU on record that on the basis of the

noting of accused Mukesh Kumar Rana, JE, an inspection

was carried out at the premises of the school of the

complainant and there is a report Ex.PW7/B of Shri H.R.

Bhatia (PW-7), then Chief Engineer (Distribution) to the effect

that the old connection is required to be disconnection as

there is one premises and the second connection cannot be

provided. It becomes clear from the evidence of Shri H.R.

Bhatia (PW-7) that he had conditionally allowed for

installation of new electric connection at the school of the

complainant (PW-5) after obtaining an undertaking from the

complainant   that     he   would   get   his   old   connection

disconnected within two days after the installation of the new

connection. There is evidence of then Assistant Engineer

Shri R.P. Goel (PW-10) to the effect that vide note dated

31.8.1996 Ex.PW10/DA it was stated in black and white that

the complainant had not got his old connection disconnected

and the DESU was compelled to take steps for disconnection

of the electricity supply to the old connection as by then,

complainant (PW-5) had got energized his new connection to

his school premises.

</p><p id="p_65">23.       As is evident from the file of DESU Ex.PW9/B,

coercive action had to be taken against the complainant

(PW-5) on 4.9.1996 and thereby despite the political clout of

the complainant (PW-5), he had to apply for amalgamation of

the old and new electric connection Ex.P-4 on 4.9.1996 itself

and since the complainant (PW-5) despite persistent efforts

could not succeed in obtaining two commercial electric

connections for his school, therefore, he nursed a grudge

against accused Mukesh Kumar Rana who was the Area

Inspector of DESU      as on his report only, the design of

complainant (PW-5) of having two commercial            electric

connection in his school stood frustrated.



</p><p id="p_66">24.       The probability of the version of the complainant

(PW-5) has to be tested by cross checking with the evidence

of official witnesses dealt above. Complainant (PW-5) wants

this court to believe that accused Mukesh Kumar Rana had

taken bribe of Rs.10,000/- through his co-accused Mahavir

for providing second commercial electric connection in the

school of the complainant which evidently was against the

policy/rules of the DESU. It is crystal clear from the evidence

on record that accused Mukesh Kumar Rana alone could not

have managed to provide second commercial electric

connection to the school of the complainant against the

policy/rules of DESU.   In such a situation, it is a remote

possibility that accused Mukesh Kumar Rana would be so

foolish that he would indirectly obtain a bribe from the

complainant (PW-5) for doing the work of the complainant

which was impossible because the sanction for the

commercial electric connection had to be granted by the

concerned Chief Engineer of DESU i.e. PW-7 who has

categorically stated in his evidence that second commercial

electric connection was to be provided to the complainant

(PW-5) only after disconnection of the old connection. This

makes it clear that two electric commercial connections

cannot be provided at one premises. Precisely, complainant

(PW-5) was asking for what was impossible i.e clearly

against the policy/rules of DESU. Since accused Mukesh

Kumar Rana was instrumental in effectively frustrating the

aforesaid ulterior purpose of the complainant, therefore, the

only inference which can be drawn is that in retaliation,

complainant (PW-5) has falsely implicated accused Mukesh

Kumar Rana in this case. To my mind, no other view can be

reasonably taken in the face of the evidence of the official

witnesses on record.
</p>
<p id="p_69">

</p><p id="p_70">25.       As regards, accused Mahavir is concerned, there

is evidence of Virender (DW-1) to the effect that accused

Mahavir and MLA Jai Bhagwan (PW-6) belong to his village

and accused Mahavir and MLA Jai Bhagwan (PW-6) were

not having good relations. Accused Mahavir claims to be a

social worker of the village of MLA Jai Bhagwan (PW-6) and

due to strained relations of being falsely implicated in this

case at the instance of Jai Bhagwan (PW-6). The undue

interest shown by MLA Jai Bhagwan (PW-6) in this case

makes the plea of accused Mahavir and evidence of Virender

(DW-1) quite probable.

a must. The solitary witness to Disclosure Statement Ex.

PW11/C is panch witness who could not be examined as he

had died. However, Investigating Officer (PW11) has stated

in his evidence that complainant (PW5) had accompanied

him and on pointing out of complainant, accused Mahavir

was arrested and in his presence, Disclosure Statement of

accused Mahavir was recorded. Complainant (PW5) is silent

in his evidence about it and does not corroborate the

Investigating Officer as voluntary nature of Disclosure

Statement is very much in doubt.

<p id="p_77">

virtually a confession which obviously is retracted by him and

in judgment reported in AIR 1958 SC 66 (Subramaniam v/s

State of Madras) it has been held that retracted confession

without being materially corroborated cannot be acted upon.

It would be preposterous to place any reliance upon

Disclosure Statement (Ex.PW11/C) as it has not led to any

recovery. Had the intention of the complainant (PW-5) been

bonafide then he would got the trap laid to get the accused

caught red handed. It is not appreciated that first allegedly

part of the bribe amount is given and when the work is not

done then the complaint is made. This leaves much to be

desired on the part of the complainant (PW-5). It is evident

from the evidence of material official witness (PW10) that

accused had not dealt with matter of complainant (PW5) prior

to 1.8.96 as it was marked to accused on that date only i.e.

1.8.96 and accused was not asked to inspect the site prior to

1.8.96. This demolishes complainant's version of incident of

26.7.96 of taking by accused of part of bribe of Rs. 10,000/-

from the complainant (PW5) . In any case, the evidence of

the complainant (PW-5) is suspect and requires worthwhile

corroboration especially regarding giving of the alleged bribe

amount of Rs.10,000/- to accused Mahavir. Rather, I find that

even the friend Surinder Gupta (PW-8) of the complainant

(PW-5) has not supported the complainant on the above said

crucial aspect of the complainant's testimony and whatever

little he has stated is hearsay evidence.

</p><p id="p_80">27.       In this peculiar case, it appears that complainant

(PW5) was just actuated with strong desire/motive to falsely

implicated accused persons as complainant due to obstacle

put by accused Mukesh Rana could not get his work despite

desperate efforts made by him. Therefore, the self serving

evidence of the complainant (PW-5) and his adviser PW-6 is

not at all sufficient to establish the prosecution case because

the evidence of official witnesses i.e. PW-2, PW-7 and PW-

10 makes the version of the complainant highly improbable.



CONCLUSION

          In view of the afore going narration, I hold that the

testimony of the Complainant (PW-5) and his adviser (PW-6)

does not inspire the confidence of this court and the

evidence of official witnesses i.e. PW-2, PW-7 and PW-10

makes the version of the Complainant (PW-5) not at all

worthy of reliance.    In this scenario, since there is no

recovery of the bribe amount, so statutory presumption does

not arise against the accused persons. Viewed from any

angle, I am of the considered view that both the accused are

entitled to benefit of doubt as the prosecution case does not

stand proved against them beyond reasonable doubt. As
