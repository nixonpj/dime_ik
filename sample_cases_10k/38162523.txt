      THIS CRIMINAL PETITION IS FILED UNDER SECTION 482
CR.P.C., PRAYING TO QUASH THE ORDER DATED 16.03.2017
PASSED BY THE IV ADDL.C.M.M., BANGALORE IN C.C.
NO.8917/2017    (PCR   NO.1016/2016)    (PRODUCED    AT

ANNEXURE-A) THEREBY TAKING COGNIZANCE AGAINST THE
PETITIONERS FOR THE OFFENCES P/U/S 406 AND 420 R/W 34
OF <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_1">IPC</a> AND ORDERING TO REGISTER CRIMINAL CASE AND
ISSUE SUMMONS AND CONSEQUENTLY QUASH THE ENTIRE
PROCEEDINGS THEREON.

      THIS CRIMINAL PETITION COMING ON FOR HEARING
THIS DAY, THE COURT MADE THE FOLLOWING:

                         ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">     This petition is filed by the petitioners/accused

Nos.1 to 4 under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_2">Section 482</a> of Cr.P.C. seeking to

quash the order dated 16.3.2017 passed by the learned

IV Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Bengaluru

City in C.C.No.8917/2017 (PCR No.1016/2016) thereby

taking    cognizance   against    the   petitioners   for   the

offences under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_3">Sections 406</a>, <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_4">420</a> r/w <a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_5">Section 34</a> of IPC

and ordering to register criminal case and issue

summons and consequently, praying to quash the

entire proceedings thereon.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">     2.     Heard the arguments of the learned counsel

appearing for the petitioners/accused Nos.1 to 4 and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                            4</span>



also the learned counsel appearing for the respondents-

complainants.
</p>
<p id="p_4">
</p><p id="p_5">     3.    Learned counsel for the petitioners apart

from challenging the order of the learned Magistrate on

other grounds also submitted that in the private

complaint the first prayer made by the complainant is to

refer the matter under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_6">Section 156(3)</a> of Cr.P.C. to the

police for investigation and to report the matter and

alternatively, the second prayer is to take cognizance of

the offence and to proceed with the matter.           He

submitted that when the request by the complainant

himself is for referring the matter to the Investigating

Officer invoking <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_7">Section 156(3)</a> of Cr.P.C., then the

decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of

Priyanka Srivastava and another Vs. State of Uttar

Pradesh and others reported in (2015)6 SCC 287

comes into play. He drew the attention of this Court to

paragraph No.30 of the said judgment and submitted
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                             5</span>



that filing of the affidavit by the complainant in support

of the allegations made in the complaint is necessary

and the learned Magistrate ought to have verified the

allegations in the complaint with the help of such

affidavit before taking a decision in the matter as to

whether it is to be reported to the police or not. Hence,

submitted that the impugned order has to go only on

this legal infirmity. So far as the merits of the case is

concerned, he submitted that they have not at all forged

the signature of the complainant nor created any false

documents. He drew the attention of the Court to the

documents produced and submitted that the column

where the complainant has to put his signature is left

blank. Therefore, question of forging the signature does

not arise at all. Apart from that, he also challenged the

complaint on the ground that it is a joint complaint by

two persons which is not maintainable. In this regard,

he relied upon the decision of this Court reported in ILR

1986 KAR 417 in the case of Parijanashram Swamiji
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                  6</span>



Vs. Kailaje. He submitted that all these aspects were

not at all considered by the learned Magistrate while

passing the impugned order. It is also his submission

that before referring the matter to the police, the learned

Magistrate has also recorded the sworn statement of the

complainant.      Once      he       has   recorded    the       sworn

statement, he cannot take a decision to refer the matter

to the police. On these grounds, he submitted that the

order of the learned Magistrate is illegal and to be set

aside by allowing the petition.
</p>
<p id="p_6">
</p><pre id="pre_2">     4.      Per-contra,     learned        counsel        for     the

respondents-complainants              opposed      the       petition

contending     that   the   joint      complaint      is   perfectly

</pre><p id="p_7">maintainable. In this connection, he relied upon the

decision reported in LAWS(MAD)2012-8-22 of High

Court of Madras wherein the decision of this Court has

been referred to in class(a) of paragraph No.6 of the said

decision reported in 2002 Crl.L.J. 481 Karnataka
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                               7</span>



wherein it is held that joint complaint is legally

maintainable under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_8">Section 200</a> of the Code of Criminal

Procedure. Hence, submitted that the contention of the

petitioners on this ground is not sustainable. He also

submitted that so far as the merits of the case is

concerned, the petitioners have created the documents

stating that the complainant has resigned from the

partnership firm.      He went out of the firm and

therefore, there is re-constitution of the partnership

firm. As such, when in fact the complainant has not at

all retired from the partnership firm, creation of the

documents clearly shows that it is cheating and

criminal breach of trust. Hence, there is a prima facie

material to show the commission of the said offences.

Accordingly, it is submitted that there is no merit in the

petition filed by the petitioners and it is to be rejected.


</p><p id="p_8">      5. So far as the merits of the case is concerned, as

submitted by both sides, they are disputed facts which
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                             8</span>



cannot be ascertained by this Court in a petition under

<a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_9">Section 482</a> of Cr.P.C. It is for the concerned trial Court

to go into the disputed facts in a trial. But regarding

the legal infirmity as canvassed by the learned counsel

for the petitioners referring to the case of Priyanka

Srivastava and another Vs. State of Uttar Pradesh

and others, the relevant paragraph No.30 shows that

whenever a request by the complainant to refer the

matter to the police under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_10">Section 156(3)</a> of Cr.P.C. for

investigation and report is made, such complaint is to

be supported by the affidavit of the complainant.      In

view of the said principle, admittedly, in the case on

hand, such affidavit is not filed along with the

complaint.    Hence, there is no compliance of the

requirement as specified in the decision of the Hon'ble

Apex Court referred to above.     However, I am of the

opinion that only on that ground, the complaint cannot

be rejected and it is necessary to give an opportunity to

the complainants to file compliance affidavit before the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                               9</span>



concerned trial Court as per the law laid down in

Priyanka Srivastava's case and in view of this legal

infirmity, the question of considering other merits of the

case does not arise at all.
</p>
<p id="p_9">
</p><p id="p_10">        6. Accordingly, petition is allowed. The impugned

order    passed   by   the    learned   Magistrate   taking

cognizance against the petitioners and ordering for

registration of criminal case and issuing process is

hereby set aside.       The matter is remitted to the

concerned Magistrate, with liberty to the complainant to

file compliance affidavit and thereafter, the learned

Magistrate shall proceed with the matter in accordance

with law.      Till cognizance in the matter is taken,

petitioners herein need not appear before the learned

Magistrate and their appearance is dispensed with. All

other contentions of both sides are kept open.
