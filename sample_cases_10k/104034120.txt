     DATED THIS THE 30TH DAY OF NOVEMBER, 2017

      THIS APPEAL IS FILED UNDER SECTION 54 (1) OF LA ACT,
1894, AGAINST THE JUDGMENT AND AWARD DATED 25.08.2014,
PASSED IN LAC NO. 180/2013 ON THE FILE OF THE ADDITIONAL
SENIOR     CIVIL     JUDGE,    JAMKHANDI,   AWARDING   THE
COMPENSATION OF RS.5,36,500/- PER ACRE AND ETC.,

      THIS APPEAL COMING ON FOR ORDERS, THIS DAY, THE
COURT DELIVERED THE FOLLOWING:
                                    2




                             JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">         This appeal is directed against the judgment and

award passed by the Addl. Senior Civil Judge, Jamkhandi,

in L.A.C.No.180/2013.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">2.       Facts in brief are that the 2nd respondent is the

owner of land in Sy.No.100/1D measuring 17 guntas and

Sy.No.100/2D measuring 2 acres 16 guntas of Halingali

village. The preliminary notification under Section 4 (1) of

the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_1">Land Acquisition Act</a>, 1894, (for short 'the Act') was

notified in the Gazette on 16.07.2009. The Special Land

Acquisition Officer passed the award dated 24.12.2011

fixing    the    market   value    of   the   acquired   lands    at

Rs.1,41,882/- per acre.           Being aggrieved, the claimant

preferred reference application.          The Reference Court

enhanced the compensation to Rs.5,36,500/- per acre

along     with   statutory    benefits.   Being   aggrieved,     the

beneficiary is in appeal.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                3</span><p id="p_4">




</p><p id="p_5">3.   The learned counsel appearing for the appellant

would contend that the Reference Court failed to consider

the sale transaction mentioned in the award as well as the

failure on the part of claimants in not producing the

particulars of the sale transaction of their village.       The

Reference Court taking the yield at 50 tonnes based on

Ex.P.15, yield certificate, determined the market value of

the acquired lands which is contrary to the judgment of

the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of HIRABAI AND

OTHERS     VS.    LAND    ACQUISITION          OFFICER-CUM-

ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER [(2010) 10 SCC 492). It is

further submitted that the Reference Court failed to note

the yield of sugarcane which is not more than 40 tonnes

per acre at the relevant point of time as revealed from the

scientific data given by the Director of Economics and the

determination of market value based on such data being

upheld by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Hirabai

supra,   the   determination       of   compensation   by   the

Reference Court is excessive. Thus, the learned counsel
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                 4</span>




submits that the compensation now determined fixing the

market value at Rs.5,36,500/- per acre is exorbitant and

contrary to the law laid down by the Hon'ble Apex Court in

the case of Hirabai supra.
</p>
<p id="p_6">
</p><p id="p_7">4.   Learned counsel Shri Harish S.Maigur, appearing for

the claimant justifying the judgment and award impugned

herein, submitted that the Reference Court has fixed the

market value based on the yield certificate and price list

produced at Ex.P.15 and Ex.P.16 respectively and the

actual   market   price    of   the   sugar   cane   excluding

cultivation cost and transportation charges. The market

value fixed by the Reference Court on capitalization

method is in conformity with the division bench judgment

of this Court in the case of Karnataka Neeravari Nigam

Ltd., Vs. Shoukat and others in M.F.A.No.21965/2010

(DD 03.03.2015).          It was argued that even if the

compensation now fixed before the Lok Adalath is

considered fixing the market value at Rs.3,69,000/- per
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                             5</span>




acre for irrigated lands with statutory benefits and 10%

escalation deserves to be extended in fixing the market

value for the lands acquired on 16.07.2009. Further, the

learned counsel placed reliance on the judgment of this

Court in Sudarshan Sangamesh Wali Vs. The Special

Land      Acquisition    Officer    and    another      in

M.F.A.No.100384/2015 (DD 08.11.2017) to contend that

the claimant is entitled to the escalation of 10% per

annum.
</p>
<p id="p_8">
</p><p id="p_9">5.     Heard the learned counsel for the parties and

perused the material on record.
</p>
<p id="p_10">
</p><p id="p_11">6.     It is perspicuous from the material on record that

the lands in question were acquired by issuing preliminary

notification under <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_2">Section 4</a> (1) of the Act, gazetted on

16.07.2009. The Reference Court mainly placing reliance

on Ex.P.15 and Ex.P.16, has determined the market value.

Ex.P.15 is the yield certificate issued by the Assistant

Director of Agriculture, Jamkhandi and Ex.P.16 is the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                               6</span>




price list issued by the Nandi Sahakari Sakkare Karkhane

Niyamit, which discloses that sugarcane yield was 50

tonnes per acre and price was Rs.2,495.97 per tonne

including the cutting and transportation charges.


</p><p id="p_12">7.   It is beneficial to refer to the judgment of the Hon'ble

Apex Court in Hirabai's case wherein it is categorically

held that when the yield certificate shown to have been

issued by the Assistant Director of Agriculture, but the

Assistant Director himself was not examined nor anybody

from his office was examined to indicate as to under what

circumstances the aforesaid certificate was issued and

what is the basis of giving such certificate and also to

show what is the method of calculation to arrive at the

aforesaid statistics, then it is not safe to rely on such

certificates without the author of the said certificate being

produced for testing the veracity of the certificate and the

contents thereof.     It is further observed that while

calculating the market value of the land on the basis of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                      7</span>




capitalization   method        of    valuation,      the     government

document published by the Director of Economics and

Statistics pertaining to the relevant year would be a

reliable document.       However, it remains clear that the

Reference Court erred in placing reliance on the certificate

issued by the Assistant Director of Agriculture, the author

of the said document not being examined to prove the

veracity of the document. Hence, determination of market

value based on the certificate of Assistant Director without

examining     the     author    is       perverse    and     cannot   be

sustained.
</p>
<p id="p_13">
</p><p id="p_14">8.    Even, if the yield is considered at 45 tonnes in terms

of   the   division    bench        judgment    of    this    Court   in

M.F.A.No.21965/2010, the compensation amount would

work out on a lesser side considering the average price of

three years as per the price list submitted by the claimant

marked at Ex.P.16.         The market value fixed by the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                8</span>




reference Court at Rs.5,36,500/- per acre for the irrigated

land appears to be on the higher side.
</p>
<p id="p_15">
</p><p id="p_16">9.    It is brought to the notice of the Court by the learned

counsel appearing for the beneficiary that good number of

cases are disposed of before the Lok Adalath after

settlement, fixing the market value for irrigated land at

Rs.3,69,000/- per acre with statutory benefits relating to

the year, 2004-2005 notification and 5% escalation per

year thereafter for similarly situated lands acquired for

Hipparagi project based on the judgment of the Hon'ble

Apex Court dismissing SLP No.8107/2016 filed by the

beneficiary   challenging    the   order    of   this   Court   in

M.F.A.No.23768/2013         whereby   the    market     value   of

acquired lands was fixed at Rs.3,69,000/- along with

statutory benefits as far as irrigated lands are concerned.


</p><p id="p_17">10.   It is hardly required to be recorded that the

claimants settling the matter before the Lok Adalath are

placed on the same pedestal as that of the claimants
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                               9</span>




contesting the matter before this Court. The nature of the

land, the purpose for which the lands were acquired and

the situation of the land being identical, same parity has

to be maintained amongst such lands acquired.


</p><p id="p_18">11.   It was an endeavour made by the learned counsel for

the claimant that 10% escalation per year would be

reasonable though sounds attractive in order to maintain

parity and consistency in the orders, 5% escalation per

year is awarded, considering the identical circumstances.

Thus, this Court finds it appropriate to fix the market

value at Rs.3,69,000/- per acre with 5% escalation per

year with statutory benefits for the irrigated land.

Accordingly,    the    claimant     shall    be     entitled    for

Rs.4,61,250/-    per   acre   for   the     lands    acquired    in

Sy.No.100/1D     and    Sy.No.100/2D        with    all   statutory

benefits, interest and costs (Rs.3,69,000+Rs.92,250 with

5% escalation for five years) considering the date of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                 10</span>




issuance of notification under <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_3">Section 4</a> (1) of the Act, i.e.,

16.07.2009.
</p>
<p id="p_19">
</p><p id="p_20">12.    For the reasons aforesaid, the judgment and award

passed by the Reference Court is modified and reduced to

Rs.4,61,250/-    per   acre     for   the    lands    acquired    in

Sy.No.100/1D     and   Sy.No.100/2D          with    all   statutory

benefits, interest and costs.
