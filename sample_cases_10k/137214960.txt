Ct. No. 9

                                  W. P. 28141 (W) of 2016



                                    Asis Guha
                                        Vs.
                           State of West Bengal &amp; Ors.



                   Mr. Dipankar Pal.
                                 ....for the petitioner.



                      The petitioner has challenged the order dated August 26,

             2016 passed by the respondent no.4, Revenue Officer, under</pre>

<p id="p_1">             Section 14T (3) of the West Bengal Land Reforms Act, 1955 and

             Sub-divisional Land and Land Reforms Officer, Baruipur, South

             24 Parganas by filing the writ petition.
</p>
<p id="p_2">                     It is contended on behalf of the petitioner that the

             petitioner purchased land from the respondent no.5 under

             various registered sale deeds during the period from 2002-2005.

             The further contention made on behalf of the petitioner is that the

             petitioner submitted application before the Block Land and Land

             Reforms Officer for correction of the name of the petitioner in the

             record of right in the year 2016. The grievance of the petitioner is

             that the respondent no.4 has initiated a proceeding for vesting of

             the land in question under <a href="/doc/688958/" id="a_1">Section 14T(3)</a> of the West Bengal
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                           2</span>


Land Reforms Act, 1955 against the vendor of the petitioner

without giving any opportunity of hearing to the petitioner.

Learned counsel representing the petitioners submits that the

petitioner has challenged the proceeding of vesting under Section

14T(3) of the West Bengal Land Reforms Act, 1955 not on merit,

but on the ground of violation of the principles of natural justice.

</p><p id="p_3">         There is no doubt that the petitioner has challenged the

proceeding under <a href="/doc/688958/" id="a_2">Section 14T</a> (3) of the West Bengal Land

Reforms Act, 1955 on the ground of violation of the principles of

natural justice.   The question for consideration of the Court is

whether this Court can exercise the writ jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_3">Article

226</a> of the Constitution of India sitting singly when the petitioner

has challenged the proceeding under Section 14T(3) of the West

Bengal Land Reforms Act, 1955.        In my view, it is immaterial

whether the impugned order under Section 14T(3) of the West

Bengal Land Reforms Act, 1955 is challenged on merit or on the

ground of violation of the principles of natural justice for the

purpose of exercise of writ jurisdiction by the Single Bench of this

Court.
</p>
<p id="p_4">         The West Bengal Land Reforms Act, 1955 is a specified

Act under <a href="/doc/133470/" id="a_4">Section 2</a> ( r) of the W. B. Land Tribunal Act. Section 6

of the W. B. Land Tribunal Act lays down that the Tribunal shall

have power, authority and jurisdiction in relation to any order
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                            3</span>


made by an authority under the specified Act. In the present case

the order under challenge is passed by the authority under

Section 14T(3) of the W. B. Land Tribunal Act which is specified

Act. It is relevant to quote the provisions of Section 8 of the W. B.

Land Tribunal Act, which is as follows: -
</p>
<p id="p_5">"8. Exclusion of Jurisdiction of courts. -
</p>
<p id="p_6">            On and from the date from which jurisdiction, power and

authority become exercisable under this Act by the Tribunal, the

High Court, except where that Court exercises writ jurisdiction

under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution by a Division

Bench, or any civil court, except the Supreme Court, shall not

entertain     any   proceeding   or   application   or   exercise   any

jurisdiction, power or authority in relation to adjudication or trial

of disputes or applications relating to land reforms or any matter

connected therewith or incidental thereto or any other matter

under any provision of a specified Act."
</p>
<p id="p_7">            On perusal of the provisions of Section 8 of the W. B.

Land Tribunal Act, I find that the Single Bench of the High Court

cannot exercise jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_5">Article 226</a> of the Constitution

of India when the Tribunal has the power, authority and

jurisdiction in relation to the impugned order under challenge in

the writ petitions.     In the instant case the Tribunal has the

jurisdiction to entertain the grievance of the petitioner in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                           4</span>


connection with the order passed by the respondent no.4 under

Section 14T(3) of the West Bengal Land Reforms Act, 1955.

</p><p id="p_8">         In view of my above findings I hold that the Single Bench

of the High Court cannot entertain the grievance of the petitioner

under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_6">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India due to specific bar

under Section 8 of the W. B. Land Tribunal Act. As a result, the

writ petition is dismissed.
