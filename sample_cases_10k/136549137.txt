<p id="p_1">     The complainant filed this complaint against the accused for the
offence punishable under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_1">Section 138</a> of Negotiable Instruments Act.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                   2                   C.C.No.56792/2017</span>


<p id="p_2">2.   The complaint case in nutshell is that the accused and her
husband approached the complainant to construct a house in their
site situated at No.13, Srinivasa Nagar, Kerekodi Road, Hoskerehalli,
Banashankari 3rd Stage, Bengaluru. Accordingly, they have entered
into a construction agreement on 10.12.2015.        The complainant
agreed to complete the construction within 5 to 6 months from the
date of signing the agreement. The complainant claims that inspite
of the delay in payments as per agreement the complainant
continued with the construction work.       The complainant further
claimed that when only 5 to 10% of plastering work was left and
other works had almost reached completion.          The complainant
sought the payment from the husband of the accused as per
agreement. The husband of the accused changed the measurements
of the construction and also changed the terms and accused and her
husband stopped making payments as per agreement. Finally, they
have estimated the dues to be paid by the accused to the
complainant is Rs.13,00,000/- and finally the parties have agreed for
Rs.8.28 Lakhs as full and final payment from accused to the
complainant.   Subsequently on 05.01.2017 to the surprise of the
complainant the accused had hired an outside contractor and
instructed him to complete the remaining work without paying the
balance payment to the complainant hence, the complainant filed the
complaint at Girinagar Police Station urging the police to recover the
balance payment from the accused and her husband wherein the
husband of the accused once again assured to make the balance

payment and issued one cheque bearing No.722727 dtd:17.12.2015
for a sum of Rs.75,000/- and another cheque bearing no.722731
dtd:26.05.2016 for a sum of Rs.1,00,000/- and both the cheques
were drawn on ICICI Bank, Jayanagar Branch. Subsequent to the
handing over of the cheque the husband of the accused instructing
the complainant not to present the cheque for encashment as she
could not arrange the funds. The complainant further claimed that
husband of the accused in the Girinagar Police Station assured to
make the part payment and husband of the accused has issued a
cheque bearing No.189502 dtd:10.04.2017 drawn on Union Bank of
India for Rs.1,00,000/- and this accused has issued a cheque bearing
No.449837 dtd:25.04.2017 drawn on Canara Bank, Padmanabha
Nagar Branch for Rs.93,000/-. When the complainant presented the
cheque of the accused for encashment, that has been returned with
bank endorsement dtd:05.06.2017 stating "Funds Insufficient".
Thereafter the complainant caused a demand notice dtd:23.06.2017,
that has been duly served on the accused on 03.07.2017. In spite of
the service of notice the accused failed to comply with the notice.
Hence, filed the complaint.
</p>
<p id="p_3">3.   After filing the complaint, sworn statement of the complainant
has been recorded and on perusing the materials on record i.e.,
cheque, bank endorsement, legal notice and documents for having
been caused the notice to the accused, the court has been taken the
cognizance of offence and issued summons to the accused.

<p id="p_4">4.   In response to the summons, the accused appeared through
his counsel and he was on court bail.      Plea has been recorded;
accused pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.
</p>

<p id="p_5">5.   To prove the case, the complainant got examined himself as
P.W.1 and got marked documents at Ex.P.1 to P.5.
</p>

<p id="p_6">6.   On closure of complainant side evidence, the accused
statement has been recorded under Sec.313(1)(b) of <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_2">Cr.P.C</a>., by
placing the incriminating evidence appeared against the accused that
are denied by the accused.
</p>

<p id="p_7">7.   The accused examined herself as D.W.1 in support of her
defense and also got marked documents at Ex.D.1 to 13. The case
made out by the accused during her evidence is that they have
entrusted the construction of their house to the complainant and also
they have entered into a construction agreement with the
complainant on 10.12.2015.        The accused claimed that the
complainant failed to complete the work as agreed by him.         The
accused also claimed that there is a defects in the construction and
also claims that tiles were not properly fixed there were water
leakage and doors and windows are not properly fixed and electricity
is not at all connected etc. The accused further claimed that the

Thereafter the complainant again came and told that he will complete
the work and asked them to issue a cheque on the promising of

completing the work. The accused further claimed that in spite of
the promise and receiving the cheque the complainant has not
carried out the work agreed by him. The accused also disputed the
service of notice and signature found in the postal acknowledgment
and among other grounds prayed for dismissal of complaint.

        accused has committed the offence punishable
        under Sec.138 of Negotiable Instruments Act?"

that basis my finding on the above point is in the "Affirmative" for
the following;

that has been duly served on the accused on 03.07.2017. In spite of

Hence, filed the complaint.
</p>

<p id="p_12">11.   The accused examined herself as D.W.1 in support of her
defense and also got marked documents at Ex.D.1 to 13. The case
made out by the accused during her evidence is that they have
entrusted the construction of their house to the complainant and also
they have entered into a construction agreement with the
complainant on 10.12.2015.        The accused claimed that the
complainant failed to complete the work as agreed by him.        The
accused also claimed that there is a defects in the construction and
also claims that tiles were not properly fixed there were water
leakage and doors and windows are not properly fixed and electricity
is not at all connected etc. The accused further claimed that the
complainant stopped working in the month of November 2016.
Thereafter the complainant again came and told that he will complete
the work and asked them to issue a cheque on the promising of
completing the work. The accused further claimed that in spite of
the promise and receiving the cheque the complainant has not
carried out the work agreed by him. The accused also disputed the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                   8                   C.C.No.56792/2017</span>


service of notice and signature found in the postal acknowledgment
and among other grounds prayed for dismissal of complaint.
</p>

<p id="p_13">12.   The complainant in support of her case examined herself as
P.W.1 and also got marked the documents at Ex.P.1 to 5. The Ex.P.1
is the cheque, Ex.P.2 is the Bank Return Memo, Ex.P.3 is the O/c of
the legal notice, Ex.P.4 and 5 are the postal receipts and postal
acknowledgment. On the basis of these documents the complainant
proved his case beyond reasonable doubt. The undisputed fact in
this case is that the accused entrusted the construction work of their
house to the complainant by entering into a construction agreement.
The accused also admitted the issuance of cheque in favour of the
complainant and also the writings and amount found in the cheque is
also not in dispute.     As such the issuance of the cheque and
signature in the cheque is an admitted fact. The said cheque has
been dishonoured for want of funds in the account of the accused.
The complainant caused a legal notice in time, even the complaint is
in time hence, it has to be inferred that the accused has issued the
Ex.P.1 cheque in favour of the complainant towards the discharge of
legally enforceable debt or liability in favour of the complainant as
per <a href="/doc/268919/" id="a_3">section 139</a> of N.I.Act.
</p>

<p id="p_14">13.   When the complainant made out a prima-facie case to draw
initial presumption under Sec.139 of N.I.Act, the burden shifts on the
accused to prove the contrary to the complaint case. The specific
defense of the accused is that the cheque has been forcibly received
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                     9                     C.C.No.56792/2017</span>


by the complainant and the complainant has not completed the work
as agreed by him and also there were defects in the construction.
Hence, claimed that they are not liable to make the payment. The
burden of proving the said fact is on the accused and it has to be
further proved by the accused that the said defense is a probable
defense in the case.
</p>

<p id="p_15">14.   Before proceedings further it is just and relevant to note the
admitted fact that the complainant has been entrusted to complete
the construction of the house of the accused as per building
agreement dtd:10.12.2015. Entering into a written agreement is also
not in dispute.     Of course the complainant has not produced the
original building construction work but produced the photostat copy
of the same. The execution of said agreement is admitted by the
accused and both the complainant and accused agreed that payment
has to be made by stage by stage constructions. The claim of the
accused that there was a delay in the construction of the building by
the   accused     though   the   complainant   has   to    complete    the
construction within 6 months he has not completed the same within
6 months. Per-contra, the complainant claims that there was a delay
of payment by the accused hence, the construction could not be
completed as per the schedule. The complainant also claimed that
the accused goes on changing the measurements and specification of
the construction.      Whatever the rival claim of the parties, it is
admitted that the accused agreed to pay Rs.30,80,000/- to the
complainant for a complete construction of the building. It is also
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                   10                  C.C.No.56792/2017</span>


relevant to note that the house is in possession of the complainant.
It is true that the accused has produced certain materials claiming
that there is a defect in the complainant's service or quality of
construction.   If at all there is any defect in the construction, the
accused has to approach the proper authority for redressal and it is
not the court or authority to hear the said grievances of the accused.
The only point to the considered in this case is whether there is a
debt or liability in favour of the complainant or whether the accused
has issued the cheque towards the discharge of legally enforceable
debt or not.
</p>

<p id="p_16">15.   Admittedly, the accused claimed that she was in possession of
the house property constructed by the complainant since 01.04.2017.
Of course the accused claimed that the complainant has not
completed the construction as such he has completed the
construction with the help of other contractors but what is the actual
amount spent by him has not been stated by the accused during the
evidence.   Of course the accused has produced some e-mails but
there is no specific averment regarding the claim of the accused.
However the accused has not produced any material on record to
show that he has paid the entire amount due to the complainant.
The burden is on the accused that entire amount due to the
complainant has been paid by the accused to the complainant when
the issuance of the cheque has been admitted by the accused.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                    11                   C.C.No.56792/2017</span>


<p id="p_17">16.   It is relevant to note that one of the defense taken by the
accused that the complainant has stopped the construction of work
and thereafter the accused got some work done through other
contractors. The accused also claimed that the complainant totally
stopped the construction work in the month of October 2016. The
complainant also claimed that all of a sudden without any intimation
to the complainant, the accused changed the contractor without
making the payment due to the complainant. The complainant also
claimed that he has lodged the police complaint against the accused
and her husband before Giri Nagar Police Station wherein they have
settled the dispute and in the police station the accused agreed to
settle the dispute amicably and thereafter issued the cheques
involved in this case as well as in other case.
</p>

<p id="p_18">17.   At this juncture, it is relevant to note the date of issuance of
the cheque as well as presentation of the cheque for encashment.
The accused during the cross-examination of P.W.1 categorically
admitted that the cheque involved in this case has been issued on
26.03.2017.    The complainant made out a specific case that the
husband of this accused issued a cheque bearing No.189502
dtd:10.04.2017 for Rs.1,00,000/- and this accused issued a cheque
bearing   No.449837     dtd:25.04.2017     drawn   on   Canara    Bank,
Padmanabha Nagar for a sum of Rs.93,000/-.         The aforesaid fact
clearly shows that before taking the possession of the house property
this accused and her husband issued the aforesaid cheques in favour
of the complainant by mentioning the post date. Therefore it is clear
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                                   12                   C.C.No.56792/2017</span>


that on 26.03.2017 this accused and her husband have issued the
post dated cheques.     Therefore, it is clear that from the date if
issuance of a cheque to the date of cheque there were clear gap of
15 days in respect of the cheque issued by the husband of the
accused and 1 month gap between the date of cheque and issuance
of cheque by this accused. The accused claimed that these cheques
have been obtained by the complainant forcibly, if it were so,
certainly there were sufficient time for the accused to take back the
cheque or to issue stop payment instructions to the respective
bankers in respect of the aforesaid cheques.

<p id="p_19">18.   It is also relevant to note that the aforesaid 2 cheques were not
presented for encashment on the date mentioned in the cheque but
those cheques have been presented for the encashment in the month
of June 2017. Therefore, almost 3 months gap between the date of
issuance of the cheque as well as presentation of cheque for
encashment. If really these cheques have been forcibly taken by the
complainant certainly this accused has ample time or opportunity
either to issue the stop payment instruction or to lodge the complaint
against the complainant.     Why this accused kept quiet without
initiating legal proceedings against the post dated cheques. Why the
accused has not made any attempt to take back the cheque nor why
not even the accused has issued stop payment instruction to banker
is also without any explanation. Apart from that the accused has also
not made out any case to show that the complainant has refused to
return the cheque when demanded to return the cheque.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                                    13                   C.C.No.56792/2017</span>


<p id="p_20">19.   It is equally important to note that the accused not at all
disputed the issuance of Ex.P.1 cheque.        Therefore, it has to be
inferred that the date, name of the payee and the amount in the
cheque are admitted by the accused. When that has been admitted
by the accused certainly this accused would have issued stop
payment instructions or at least would have lodged a police
complaint stating that the cheque has been forcibly taken by the
complainant.    If at all the cheque has been received by the
complainant forcibly, certainly this accused would have caused a
written notice to the complainant calling upon him to return the
cheque. Why the accused failed to take any of the above said steps
or why the accused has kept quiet is without any explanation and the
said fact certainly probablise the case of the complainant that the
cheque is issued towards the discharge of debt or liability.
</p>

<p id="p_21">20.   The accused disputed the service of notice and also denied her
signature in the postal acknowledgment.       The specific case of the
accused is that subsequent to 01.04.2017 they were residing in the
newly constructed house. It is true that the accused has sent the
notice to the previous address.         When the accused specifically
claimed that she is residing in the newly constructed house when the
said fact is within the knowledge of the complainant, the complainant
ought to have sent the notice to the said address.             Why the
complainant has not sent the notice to the said address is without
any explanation. In this context it is useful to refer the principle laid
down in (2007)6 SCC 555 C.C.Alavi Haji .Vs. Pallapetty Muhammed &amp;
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                                   14                   C.C.No.56792/2017</span>


Anr. As per the said principle, if there is no service of notice, the
accused can put forth his defense even after putting up his
appearance before the court. The accused can deposit the cheque
amount under protest.      The object of issuing the notice under
Sec.138(b) is to give an opportunity to the accused to make the
payment. In this case the accused even after knowing the filing of
this case and bouncing of his cheque not paid the cheque amount.
</p>

<p id="p_22">21.   In view of the aforesaid discussions it is clear that the accused
has issued the cheque just 5 days before the house warming
ceremony therefore, it has to be inferred that almost after completion
of the work the cheque has been issued before taking possession of
the house from the complainant. There is no material on record to
show that the accused has paid any amount subsequent to that date
nor made out any case to show that either the accused has issued
stop payment instructions nor asked the complainant to return the
cheque.   Even there is no material on record to show that the
amount stated in the cheque has been paid.          As already stated
earlier, if there is any deficiency in constructions, the accused must
approach the competent authority for redressal. Hence, the accused
is liable to pay the amount stated in the cheque. Therefore, it is
clear that the defense taken by the accused is certainly not a
probable defense. When the defense is not probable, certainly the
case of the complainant has to be accepted and it has to be inferred
that the complainant has proved his case beyond reasonable doubt.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">                                   15                   C.C.No.56792/2017</span>


<p id="p_23">22.   In this case, the complainant has claimed compensation. As
per <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_4">Section 357</a> of Criminal Procedure Code and as per the ruling
reported in; 2001 Cri.L.J. 950 (SC), (Pankajbai Nagibai Patel
V/s State of Gujarath), the court can award compensation and
there were no limits for the same. As such, the court has to consider
how much compensation could be awarded in this case.            As per
<a href="/doc/1215661/" id="a_5">Section 80</a> of Negotiable Instruments Act, the interest at 18% P.A.
can be granted when there is no agreed rate of interest. As per the
proved facts of the case, the accused has issued cheque towards the
legally enforceable debt, the accused has issued a cheques dated
25.04.2017 as per Ex.P.1 and thus, the accused has to pay interest
on the cheque amount from the date of cheque and so, the accused
has to pay interest for about 2 years till this date. If the interest is
calculated at 18% P.A. to the cheque amount for the above period,
certainly, the complainant is entitled for the suitable compensation to
the cheque amount as per <a href="/doc/1215661/" id="a_6">Section 80</a> of Negotiable Instruments Act.
The cheques amount in this case is Rs.93,000/- and if the interest is
calculated for 24 months, the accused shall pay the interest to the
complainant at 18% P.A. that amounts to Rs.33,480/-. The case is
pending nearly about 2 years as such if the cost of Rs.1,000/- is
added to the compensation, it will comes to Rs.1,27,480/- (Cheque
amount is Rs.93,000/-, interest is Rs.33,480/- and cost Rs.1,000/-).
Hence, this court is of the humble opinion that in all the complainant
is entitled for compensation amount of Rs.1,27,480/-. Further as per
the ruling reported in 2000 Cri.L.J 1793(b) SC - (State of Karnataka
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                                    16                   C.C.No.56792/2017</span>


V/s Krishnappa) wherein it is held that while imposing sentence, the
courts are expected to properly operate sentence system, it should
be impose such sentence for code offence which serve as detention
of commission of like offences by others - Socio economic status,
prestige, race, caste or creed of accused or victim are irrelevant
considerations in sentencing policy. Hence, in this case also, if the
accused is punished with simple imprisonment for one year and pay
compensation to the complainant. Anyhow the object of Sec.138 of
N.I.Act is to have accountability in the business transaction and the
intention of the complainant is only to get his money back.         The
complainant certainly not interested in sentencing the accused for
any imprisonment.        Further, the offence is punishable with
imprisonment or fine. Anyhow the object of Sec.138 of N.I.Act is to
have accountability in the business transaction and the intention of
the complainant is only to get his money back.        The complainant
certainly not interested     in sentencing     the   accused   for any
imprisonment. Further, the offence is punishable with imprisonment
or fine.   Hence, in this case after awarding the compensation
certainly imposing of fine to the accused is sufficient sentence.

Suresh Kumar V/s Jagadishan). Where in it is held at page no.1005,
at para 5 that:

      1988 (4) SCC 551 <a href="/doc/212245/" id="a_7">Hari Singh v. Sukhbir Singh</a>. In the
      said decision this court held as follows:

<blockquote id="blockquote_3">      "The quantum of compensation may be determined by
      taking into account the nature of crime, the justness of
      the claim by the victim and the ability of accused to pay.
      If there are more than one accused they may be asked to
      pay in equal terms unless their capacity to pay varies
      considerably. The payment may also very depending
      upon the acts of each accused. Reasonable period for
      payment of compensation, if necessary by installments,
      may also be given. The court may enforce the order by
      imposing sentence in default."

<p id="p_25">24.   In view of the aforesaid precedent of Hon'ble Apex Court, if the

pay the compensation will make the ends of justice. Accordingly I
