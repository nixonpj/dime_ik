IN THE HIGH COURT OF JUDICATURE FOR RAJASTHAN AT
                    JODHPUR

                    :JUDGMENT:

Birma Ram &amp; Others
      Vs.
Teja Ram &amp; Others
(S.B. Civil Misc. Appeal No.1251/2010)



DATE OF JUDGMENT :                  December 01, 2010


                        PRESENT

    HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE GOPAL KRISHAN VYAS
    __________________________________________




Mr. O.P. Joshi for the appellant.

BY THE COURT :</pre>

<p id="p_1">     Instant appeal has been filed under Order 43

Rule 1(r) of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 against

order dfated 13.11.2010 passed by Addl. District

Judge, Parbatsar in Civil Misc. Case No.81/2010,

whereby,      learned   trial   Court   granted   temporary

injunction upon application filed under Order 39 Rules

1, &amp; 2, C.P.C. by the plaintiff-respondents in the suit

for declaration of easement right and permanent

injunction.
</p>
<p id="p_2">     As per facts of the case, suit was filed by the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                    2</span>

plaintiff-respondents for declaration and permanent

injunction in respect of way on the basis of easement

right.      Along with the said suit, an application under

Order 39, Rules 1 &amp; 2, C.P.C., read with Section 151,

C.P.C. was also filed.        As per the plaintiffs' case, their

ancestral      agricultural    land     is   situated   in   khasra

No.243/2, measuring 12 bigha 9 biswa at village

Bithwaliya. The said land is recorded in the name of

the      plaintiffs   and   they       are   in   possession   and

cultivating the said land.         It is also pleaded that one

more land situated in Khasra No.243/5, measuring 12

bigha 9 biswa is in the name of Madhu Ram and

Kailash and they are also in possession.             The plaintiffs

further pleaded that for going into their land, one road

is situated in khasra No.243/2 and khasra No.243/5

and this way is being used by them for last many

years, therefore, they are having easement right to

use the said way but the defendants have closed the

said way, therefore, prayer was made that suit was

filed for declaration on the basis of easement right

that defendant shall not raise any obstruction to use

the said way.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                        3</span><p id="p_3">

</p><p id="p_4">     Learned trial Court upon application filed for

temporary injunction sought reply from defendant-

appellants and, thereafter, reply was filed by the

appellants, in which, assertion made by the plaintiff-

respondents was refuted and submitted that there are

other way in existence which is usually used by the

plaintiffs and land upon which they are claiming

easement     right    is     belonging         to     the    defendants,

therefore,   no      case        is    made     out    for    temporary

injunction; but, learned trial Court after providing

opportunity of hearing both the parties, found that

prima   facie     case      is        made    out,    therefore,   after

obtaining commissioner's report passed temporary

injunction against the defendant-appellants that they

shall not raise any obstruction upon the way in

question, so also, whatever material has been put

upon the way for raising obstruction may be removed.

This order has been passed while exercising power

under Section 151, C.P.C.
</p>
<p id="p_5">     Learned counsel for the appellants submits that

the order impugned deserves to be quashed on two

grounds.     Firstly, as per basic concept of law, final
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                              4</span>

relief cannot be granted while passing order on

temporary injunction if it is to be adjudicated whether

public way was in existence, then, before adjudication,

no injunction order or order under Section 151, C.P.C.

can be passed; but, the learned trial Court while

deciding the application for temporary injunction has

granted the final relief and, so also, wrongly accepted

that there is prima facie case in favour of the plaintiff-

respondents, therefore, the impugned order may be

quashed and set aside.
</p>
<p id="p_6">     Learned     counsel   for   the     appellants   placed

reliance upon two judgments reported in 2008 (1)

W.L.C. (SC) (Civil) and 2002 (2) D.N.J. (Rajasthan)

631 and submits that before declaration of easement

right no order of temporary injunction can be made.

</p><p id="p_7">     I have considered the arguments advanced by

learned counsel for the appellants.
</p>
<p id="p_8">     In   para   13   of   the   order    impugned,    it   is

specifically observed by the trial Court while deciding

the temporary injunction application that as per reply

of the defendants they are not disputing the existence

of the way but only submissions is that said way is not
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                            5</span>

situated in khasra No.243/3 but it is at the side of

khasra No.243/4.      On the basis of such averment

learned trial Court found that prima facie case is made

out against the defendants.          Trial Court further

observed in para 14 of the order that as per Section

15 of the Easement Act it is provided that it has to be

established by way of leading evidence and, in this

case, easement right is to be adjudicated by the

Court; but, the fact remains that defendant-appellants

are not disputing the way but they are disputing that

the way is not as per the pleadings of the suit.   In my

opinion, no error has been committed by the learned

trial Court while granting the interim order in exercise

of the power conferred under Section 151, C.P.C.      If

the said way is in existence, then, it cannot be closed.

In this view of the matter, the facts of this case are

altogether different, then, judgments cited by learned

counsel for the appellants do not apply in the facts

and circumstances of the present case.      I am of the

opinion that no error has been committed by learned

trial Court while passing order upon application filed

under Order 39 Rules 1 &amp; 2, C.P.C.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                             6</span><p id="p_9">

</p><p id="p_10">     Hence,    this   appeal    is   hereby   dismissed.

However, very short question is involved in the suit.

It is, therefore, expected of the trial Court that the

suit itself will be decided within a period six months

from the date of receiving certified copy of this order.
