                                  ORAL ORDER</pre>
<p id="p_1">1.    By way of the present application under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_1">Section
      438</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, the
      applicant­accused has prayed for anticipatory bail
      in    connection          with     the         FIR    being     C.R.       No.    I-
      33/2018      registered            with         Sikka       Police     Station,
      Jamnagar        for       the        offenses              punishable        under
      <a href="/doc/1326844/" id="a_2">Sections 409</a>, <a href="/doc/1317063/" id="a_3">465</a>, <a href="/doc/1985627/" id="a_4">467</a>, <a href="/doc/556166/" id="a_5">468</a>, <a href="/doc/1466184/" id="a_6">471</a> and <a href="/doc/1128948/" id="a_7">120(B)</a> of the
      Indian Penal Code.
</p><p id="p_2">2.    Learned advocate for the applicant submits that
      the    nature        of    allegations               are    such     for     which
      custodial        interrogation                 at    this     stage     is       not
      necessary. He further submits that the applicant
      will keep himself available during the course of
      investigation, trial also and will not flee from
      justice.
</p><p id="p_3">3.    Learned advocate for the applicant on instructions
      states that the applicant is ready and willing to
      abide by all the conditions including imposition

       R/CR.MA/3572/2019                                            ORDER



     of    conditions         with          regard       to        powers      of
     Investigating Agency to file an application before
     the competent Court for his remand. He further
     submit that upon filing of such application by the
     Investigating          Agency,        the    right       of      applicant
     accused to oppose such application on merits may
     be    kept       open.    Learned           advocate,          therefore,
     submitted that considering the above facts, the
     applicant may be granted anticipatory bail.
</p><p id="p_4">4.   Learned Additional Public Prosecutor appearing on
     behalf of the respondent - State has opposed grant
     of anticipatory bail looking to the nature and
     gravity of the offence.
</p><p id="p_5">5.   Having heard the learned advocates for the parties
     and perusing the material placed on record and
     taking into consideration the facts of the case,
     nature of allegations, gravity of offences, role
     attributed to the accused, without discussing the
     evidence in detail, at this stage, I am inclined
     to grant anticipatory bail to the applicant. This
     Court has considered the fact that the applicant
     is   aged      about     58     years       and    for     the      alleged
     incident,       which    has      occurred        during      the     period
     between 2008 to 2013, FIR came to be lodged in the
     month of September, 2018 and thus, there is gross
     delay in lodging the said FIR. Therefore in view
     of the aforesaid circumstances and in view of the
     allegations leveled against the applicant, I am
     inclined to exercise the discretion in favour of
     the applicant.
</p><p id="p_6">6.   This Court has also taken into consideration the
     law laid down by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the

     case of Siddharam Satlingappa Mhetre Vs. State of
     Maharashtra and Ors., reported at [2011] 1 SCC
     694, wherein the Hon'ble Apex Court reiterated the
     law laid down by the Constitution Bench in the
     case of Shri Gurubaksh Singh Sibbia &amp; Ors. Vs.
     State of Punjab, reported at (1980) 2 SCC 565.
</p><p id="p_7">7.   In the result, the present application is allowed.
</p><p id="p_8">     The applicant is ordered to be released on bail in
     the event of his arrest in connection with a FIR
     being    C.R.        No.   I-33/2018        registered    with     Sikka
     Police      Station,        Jamnagar        on   his     executing     a
     personal bond of Rs.10,000/­ (Rupees Ten Thousand

     following conditions:

           make himself available for interrogation
           whenever required;

           Station on 18.04.2019 between 11.00 a.m. and
           2.00 p.m.;

           of the case till further orders;

            shall deposit the same before the Trial Court
            within a week; and

</p><p id="p_15">      (g)   it would be open to the Investigating Officer
            to file an application for remand if he
            considers it proper and just and the learned
            Magistrate would decide it on merits;
</p>
<p id="p_16">8.    Despite      this      order,      it       would   be      open     for    the
      Investigating          Agency      to       apply   to      the    competent
      Magistrate, for police remand of the applicant.
      The   applicant         shall      remain       present       before         the
      learned Magistrate on the first date of hearing of
      such application and on all subsequent occasions,
      as may be directed by the learned Magistrate. This
      would be sufficient to treat the accused in the
      judicial custody for the purpose of entertaining
      application of the prosecution for police remand.
      This is, however, without prejudice to the right
      of the accused to seek stay against an order of
      remand, if, ultimately, granted, and the power of
      the learned Magistrate to consider such a request
      in accordance with law. It is clarified that the
      applicant,           even    if,     remanded          to     the         police
      custody, upon completion of such period of police
      remand, shall be set free immediately, subject to
      other conditions of this anticipatory bail order.

      influenced by the prima facie observations made by
      this Court in the present order.
