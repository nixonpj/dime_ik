               -----------------------------------------
           Dated this the 29th day of January, 2014

                             JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">      The petitioner, who holds a Pakistani passport and had filed

an application dated 5.4.2013 before the Central Government

under <a href="/doc/1618764/" id="a_1">section 9(2)</a> of the Citizenship Act, 1955 for determination

of his national status, has filed this writ petition challenging Ext.P3

order issued by the Foreigners Registration Officer and District

Police Chief on 23.12.2013 to the effect that the petitioner shall

not remain in India after 10.1.2014.
</p>
<p id="p_2">      2. The stand taken by the third respondent Sub Inspector

of Police in his statement dated 25.1.2014 is that the petitioner's

application to determine his national status was rejected by the

Government of India by Annexure R3(a) order passed on

29.10.2013 and that it was in the light of the said order that

Ext.P3 order was issued.
</p>
<p id="p_3">      3.   When this writ petition came up for hearing today

Sri.Mohammed Rafiq, learned counsel appearing for the petitioner

submitted that until the writ petition was filed a copy of Ext.R3(a)

order was not served on the petitioner. He however, conceded

that a copy was made available by the learned Government

W.P(C)No.918/2014
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                   -:2:-</span>

Pleader and with that copy the petitioner has filed a review

petition before the Central Government under <a href="/doc/139555073/" id="a_2">section 15A</a> of the

Citizenship Act and in such circumstances the writ petition may be

disposed of with a direction to the Government of India to

consider the review petition expeditiously and to stay the

petitioner's deportation until such time as the review petition is

heard and disposed of.
</p>
<p id="p_4">       4. <a href="/doc/139555073/" id="a_3">Section 15A</a> of the Citizenship Act, 1955 stipulates that

any person aggrieved by an order made by the Central

Government, may within thirty days from the date of such order,

make an application for review of such order. The Central

Government is however empowered to condone the delay, if any,

in filing the application, if sufficient cause is shown.   In such

circumstances as a review petition is maintainable and the

petitioner has filed a petition seeking review of Annexure R3(a)

order rejecting his application under <a href="/doc/1618764/" id="a_4">section 9(2)</a> of the

Citizenship Act, 1955, I am of the opinion that the proper course

would be to direct the Government of India to dispose of the

review petition on the merits and to stay the petitioner's

deportation until such time as orders are passed on the review

petition and communicated to him subject to the condition that

the petitioner shall report before the third respondent Sub

Inspector of Police every Monday until the order on the review

petition is served on him.
</p>
<p id="p_5">      I accordingly dispose of the writ petition with a direction to

the first respondent to dispose of the review petition stated to

have been filed by the petitioner seeking a review of order

No.26021/10/2013-IC.1       dated     29.10.2013     whereby     his

application for determination of his national status under <a href="/doc/1084409/" id="a_5">section 9</a>

(2) of the <a href="/doc/305990/" id="a_6">Citizenship Act</a>, 1955 was dismissed, expeditiously and

in any event within two months from the date of receipt of a copy

of this judgment. Needless to say, the petitioner shall be afforded

an opportunity of being heard before orders are passed on the

review petition. The Government shall, after orders are passed

on the review petition, communicate it to the petitioner through

the third respondent. Until such time as orders are passed and

communicated to the petitioner and for a period of one week

thereafter, the deportation of the petitioner shall stand stayed

subject to the condition that he should report without fail before

the third respondent every Monday.
