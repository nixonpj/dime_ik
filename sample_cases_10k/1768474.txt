<p id="p_1">JUDGMENT
 

 Vikramajit Sen, J. 
</p>
 

<p id="p_2"> 1. The Petitioner's contention is that it had entered
into a contract with the Respondent for the supply of audio
magnetic tapes in strict compliance with the specification
and requirements of Messers Philips India Limited
(hereinafter referred to as 'PIL'). The supplies were to
be made between December 99 and June 2000, and were so
done. In May 2000 a 'balance confirmation' was arrived at.
Although the Petitioner's letter dated 19.5.2002 to the
Respondent contained a request for a confirmation of dues
of Rs. 41,20,049/-, since further supplies had been made in
that very month for a value of Rs. 3,07,344/-, the
Respondent confirmed on that very letter that as on 31st
May, 2000 a total sum of Rs. 44,27.393 was outstanding
against the Petitioner. Copies of the Purchase Orders
placed by the Respondent on the Petitioner together with
corresponding Invoices have been filed along with the
Petition. On the failure of the Respondent to meet its
financial commitments, a statutory notice dated 28th May,
2001 was served on the Respondent in which a demand was
record for Rs. 45,78.228 along with interest at the rate
of 21 per cent per annum calculated from July 1, 2000. In
reply to the said notice the Respondent Company stated,
inter alia, that it had confirmed the balance of
Rs. 44,27,393 payable by them as on 31.5.2002 although a
Debit Note for Rs. 5,92,960/- had already been raised; the
officials of the Petitioner including Mr. Y.K. Bhardwaj
had admitted and agreed to take the Debit Note into account
and had also agreed to reduce the price of further
supplies. Significantly, the Respondent had expressed its
intentions to clear the balance in due course, and that
they had still "not come out of financial crises being
suffered". In a subsequent letter dated 20.6.2001 the
Respondent had once again stated that they were "making
serious and honest efforts to clear your account and we
will keep making payments on regular basis as we are
hopeful that our company's financial position will
improve". In the same letter it had also been stated that
"regarding starting business again please give us your best
price for regular grade C-60 &amp; C-90 that we can issue
purchase order along with full payment in advance as well
as partly old payment." 
</p>
 

<p id="p_3"> 2. In opposition to the petition the Respondent has
submitted that the audio magnetic tapes that had been
supplied to it by the Petitioner did not conform to the
'Philips grade' and that it was for this reason that there
were widespread rejections of the consignment when it was
supplied by the Respondent to PIL. In respect of the
confirmation of the balance dues it has pleaded as follows: 
</p>
<p id="p_4">  "On or about 19.5.2002, the Petitioner
requested the Respondent to sign the
balance confirmation which was required for
audit purpose. The Respondent Company
singed the same, however, had made it clear
to the Petitioner that the Debit Note
issued to the Petitioner should be taken
into account and in case of any rejection
of cassettes in respect of Magnetic Tapes
supplied by the Petitioner, appropriate
adjustment should be given. Hereto annexed
and marked Annexure R-5 is the copy of the
letter dated 19.5.2001 issued by the
Respondent and accepted by Mr. Y.K.
</p><p id="p_5">Bharadwaj, AGM, Marketing on behalf of the 
Petitioner Company." 
</p>
 

<p id="p_6"> 3. Reliance has been placed by Respondent's learned
counsel on <a href="/doc/874842/" id="a_1">Section 12</a> of the Sale of Goods Act, 1930. The
argument is that since the purchase order had itself
indicated that the audio magnetic tapes must be of 'Philips
grade', there was an implied warranty to this effect, the
breach of which invested the Respondent with the right to
treat the contract as repudiated. This very Section, it
will be noted, draws a distinction between a 'condition'
and a 'warranty' and its determination will depend on the
construction of the contract. It is the Respondent's case
that the rejections took place in or about September 2001.
It has been explained that since the tapes were supplied by
the Respondent to PIL and thereafter for onward sale to the
latter's customers, it took almost one year for the defects
to be noticed and the consequent rejections to be made. 
</p>
 

<p id="p_7"> 4. In winding-up proceedings it is necessary to keep the
following conditions in perspective - 
</p>
   

<p id="p_8"> (i) If there is a bona fide dispute and the defense
is a substantial one, the Court will not wind-up the
company. 
</p>
 

<p id="p_9"> (ii) Where the debt is undisputed the Court will not
act upon a defense that the company has the ability to pay
the debt but the company chooses not to pay it. 
</p>
 

<p id="p_10"> (iii) Where the defense of the company is in good
faith and one of substance, and the defense is likely to
succeed in point of law, and the company adduces prima
facie proof of the facts on which the defense depends, the
petition should be rejected. 
</p>
 

<p id="p_11"> (iv) The Court may consider the wishes of creditors
so long as these appear to be justified. 
</p>
 

<p id="p_12"> (v) The machinery of winding-up should not be allowed
to be utilised merely as a means of Realizing its debts. 
</p>
 

<p id="p_13"> [For the above propositions see Pradeshiya
Industrial and Investment Corporation of
Uttar Pradesh v. North India Petro-Chemical
Ltd. and Anr., (1994) 2 Comp LJ 50 (SC)
in which the observation in Amalgamated
Commercial Traders (P) Ltd. v.
</p><p id="p_14">Krishnaswami, [1965] 35 Comp. Case 456 (<a href="/doc/1556666/" id="a_2">SC)
and Madhusudan Gordhandas and Co. v. Madhu
Woollen Industries (P) Ltd</a>., [1972] 42 Comp.
Cas. 125 (SC) have been paraphrased]. 
</p>
 

<p id="p_15"> (vi) If the stance of the adversaries hangs in
balance it is always open to the Company Court to order the
Respondent Company to deposit the disputed amount. This
amount may be retained by the Court and be held to the
credit of the suit, if any. [see Civil Appeal No. 720 of
1999 arising out of SLP (C) No. 14096 of 1998 - 
Nishal Enterprises v. Apte Amalagamations Ltd., decided on
February 5, 1999]. 
</p> 

<p id="p_16"> It appears to me that the following point may be
added to the foregoing consideration. 
</p>
 

<p id="p_17"> (vii) Generally speaking, an admission of debt should
be available and the defense that has been adopted should
appear to the Court not to be dishonest and/or a moonshine,
for proceedings to continue. If there is insufficient
material in favor of the petitioners, such disputes can be
properly adjudicated only in a regular civil suit. It is
extremely helpful to draw upon the analogy of a summary
suit under Order xxxvII of the Code of Civil Procedure. If
the Company Court reaches the conclusion that, had it been
exercising ordinary original civil jurisdiction, it would
have granted unconditional leave to defend, it must dismiss
the winding-up petition.  
</p>
 

<p id="p_18"> 5. Applying the above considerations to the facts of the
present case it cannot be lost sight of that the Respondent
had confirmed a balance of Rs. 44,27,393 as on 31.5.2000.
The only contemporaneous and ascertained amount which the
Respondent can be given benefit of in these proceedings is
the Debit Note for Rs. 5,92,960/-. Mr. Jay Salva, learned
counsel appearing on behalf of Respondent, had argued that
audio tapes for a total value of Rs. 28,50,000/- have been
returned by PIL for the reason of their being sub-standard
and not of Philips grade. 
</p>
 

<p id="p_19"> 6. The Hon'ble Supreme Court has clarified in
 <a href="/doc/1838282/" id="a_3">Gopalakrishna Pillai v. K.M. Mani</a>,   ,  that
a breach of warranty does not entitle a buyer to reject the
goods and his only remedy would be to set up against the
seller the breach of warranty  in diminution or extinction
of the price, or to sue the seller for damages for breach
of warranty. It has also been contended that because of
the rejection of the goods by PIL the Respondent has
incurred heavy damages and that these contracts have now
been placed on other parties. Since a considerably long
period of almost one year has elapsed between the supply of
the goods and their rejection it may be impermissible to
allow the Respondent a diminution of price in these
proceedings since delivery of the goods would be treated as
having been accepted. The Court cannot also close its eyes
to the fact that while making the payment of Rs. 50,000/- as
late as in June 2001, the Respondent did not state that any
further audio magmatic tapes supplies by the Petitioner had
been rejected by PIL. The fact that the Respondent had
confirmed the balance due as on 31.5.2000 cannot be ignored
since it sets up not just a prima facie case but a
preponderant claim in the Petitioner's favor. Had the
balance confirmation not been available in favor of the
Petitioner, the Company Court may have considered it
expedient to insist that the Petitioner should avail of the
ordinary remedy of filing a civil suit. The delay in
setting up the defense or rejection of goods makes it lose
credibility. 
</p>
 

<p id="p_20"> 7. In these circumstances the winding-up petition is
admitted. The Respondent is directed to deposit with the
Registrar of this Court, within four weeks from today, a
sum of Rs. 39,35,268/- calculated in the following manner : 
</p><pre id="pre_1">   Principal Amount              Rs. 45,28,228/-
Less Debit Note               Rs.  5,92,960/-
                              _______________
                Total         Rs. 39,35,268/-
                              _______________   
 

</pre><p id="p_21"> From the above amount a sum of Rs. 17,00,000/-,
which counsel for the Respondent has stated is admittedly
due to the Petitioner, shall be released forthwith. The
balance amount shall be invested by the Registrar of this
court on the most favorable terms available. The
parties may initiate legal proceedings as it may find
appropriate including a civil suit etc. within four
weeks from today. If this is done, the balance amount
shall lie to the credit of the suit. The Petitioner may
seek appropriate orders for the release of the amount or
part thereof, as the case may be, in those proceedings.
The Respondent would be entitled to set-up any defense
available to it in those proceedings. 
</p>
 

<p id="p_22"> 8. On the failure of the Respondent to make compliance
the citation shall be published in the Indian Express
(English), Nav Bharat (Hindi) and Delhi Gazette, returnable
for 25.9.2002. It is made clear that in such an event a
Provisional Liquidator is likely to be appointed on the
next date of hearing keeping in view the fact that the
Respondent has itself mentioned in its letters that it is
undergoing financial problems. 
</p>
 

<p id="p_23"> 9. Renotify the matter on 1.11.2002.
