</p>
<p id="p_15">                6.The relevant portion of the decision rendered by the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in Church of God (Full gospel) in India Vs. K.K.R.Majestic
Colony Welfare Association and others,  reported in 2001 1 L.W. (Crl.) 233
reads as follows:
</p><p id="p_16">        ?....  Further, it is to be stated that because of urbanization or
industrialization, the noise pollution may in some area of a city / town
might be exceeding permissible limits prescribed under the rules, but that
would not be a ground for permitting others to increase the same by beating
of drums or by use of voice amplifiers, loudspeakers or by such other musical
instruments and, therefore, rules prescribing reasonable restrictions
including the rules for the use of loudspeakers and voice amplifiers framed
under the Madras Town Nuisance Act, 1889, and also the Noise Pollution 
(Regulation and Control) Rules, 2000 are required to be enforced.  We would
mention that even though the Rules are unambiguous, there is lack of
awareness among the citizens as well as the Implementation Authorities about
the Rules or its duty to implement the same.  Noise pollution activities
which rampant and yet for one reason or the other, the aforesaid Rules or the
rules framed under various State Police Acts are not enforced.  Hence, the
High Court has rightly directed implementation of the same.  In the result,
the appeal is dismissed. ?

<p id="p_17">        7. The application shall be submitted only by the trustees of the
Temple or the committee of the Vizha Kzhuvinar or the organizers of the
festival committee before the concerned respondent police. The petitioner in
his representation dated 09.04.2018 has specifically stated that he is the
President of the Temple Committee and therefore, the respondent is directed
to consider the said representation in accordance with law, by taking into
consideration the conditions imposed by this Court in W.P.(MD)No.7911 of
2018, dated 12.04.2018, if there is no rival claim to conduct the festival.
</p>
<p id="p_18">        8.In addition to the above conditions imposed in WP(MD)No.13517 of
2017, in the event of permission is granted by the respondent, the member or

concerned that there will not be any obscenity or vulgarity in the cultural
