:JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">S.MANIKUMAR,J

		The writ appeal is directed against the common order of the learned
Single Judge in W.P.(MD)Nos.1058 and 1065 of 2007 dated 11.06.2007 by which the
learned Single Judge set aside the order of the District Elementary Educational
Officer, Karur, Karur District declaring the first respondent as surplus and
transferring her to the third respondent school therein.
</p>
<p id="p_2">	2.Facts in brief are as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_3">	The first respondent is a teacher in C.S.I.Elementary School for boys,
Karur Union, Karur District. On 18.08.2006, 21.08.2006 and 31.08.2006, the
educational authorities inspected the school, it was found that out of total
strength of 160 students, 128 students were present and same was recorded in the
inspection proceedings.  Considering the need of one secondary grade teacher
corresponding to the students strength, on 14.11.2006, the petitioner was
appointed as Secondary Grade Teacher in the school. However, the appellant
herein without any justification on the basis of G.O.Ms.No.525, School Education
(D1) Department dated 29.12.1997 made an erroneous calculation and declared the
petitioner as surplus and transferred her to  Marist Aided Elementary School
(Boys) P.Udayarpatti, Kadavur Union, Karur District.  The order declaring the
first respondent as surplus and the consequential transfer were impugned in the
Writ Petition. In the Writ Petition, the District Elementary Educational
Officer, Karur, Karur District, the appellant had contended that as per
inspection reports and norms laid down in G.O.Ms.No.525, School Education (D1)
Department dated 29.12.1997, the school can have only three teachers (1
Headmaster and 2 Secondary Grade Assistants) and therefore, the first respondent
being found surplus was transferred. As the student-pupil calculation made by
the appellant was contrary to the  Full Bench decision of this Court in Director
of Elementary Education, Chennai-6 and others Vs. S.Vigila and another reported
in 2006 (5) CTC 385, the order declaring the first respondent as surplus was set
aside, with a direction to the appellant to release the salary grant to the
first respondent within a period of four weeks. The present appeal is directed
against the said order.
</p>
<p id="p_4">	3.Mr.R.Manoharan, learned Government Advocate appearing for the appellant
submitted that based on the inspection reports submitted by the Assistant
Elementary Educational Officer, Karur District and the norms laid down in
G.O.Ms.No.525, School Education (D1) Department dated 29.12.1997, orders were
issued redeploying the surplus teacher to another needy school.  He further
submitted that grant can be released only if the first respondent works in a
sanctioned post in a school.  As the first respondent has already been
transferred along with her post to Marist Aided Primary School, P.Udyappatti,
Kadavoor, Karur District, the second respondent, viz., C.S.I. Elementary School
for Boys, Karur District who has retained the teacher in the same school alone
is liable to pay salary to her and the Government is not liable to pay the
salary grant.
</p>
<p id="p_5">	4.Per contra, Mr.G.Maruthiah, learned for the first respondent submitted
that the order made in Writ Petition is in consonance with the Full Bench
decision of this Court which laid down the manner in which G.O.Ms.No.525, School
Education (D1) Department dated 29.12.1997 has to be interpreted and therefore,
it does not require any interference. He further submitted that as the
Government has not disbursed the salary grant, the teacher is put to hardship.
</p>
<p id="p_6">	5.Heard the learned counsel appearing for the parties.
</p>
<p id="p_7">	6.The directions of the Full Bench in Vigila's case (2006 (5) CTC 385) as
to the manner of interpretation G.O.Ms.No.525, School Education (D1) Department
dated 29.12.1997  are as follows:
</p>

<p id="p_8">	"1) The ratio of students-teacher strength as indicated in the G.O. should
be primarily considered by taking each individual standard/section as a unit.
</p><p id="p_9">	2)The minimum strength of teachers required obviously should not fall
below the number of Standards/Section in a school. In other words, if there are
five standards, obviously the minimum number of teachers should be five, out of
which one would be the Headmaster.
</p><p id="p_10">	3)If the students' strength in a particular Standard exceeds 60, at that
stage, an additional section is required to be created requiring the sanction of
a second teacher and the strength reaches 100, the post of a third teacher is
required.
</p><p id="p_11">	4)Even after maintaining the aforesaid ratio by taking into account the
students' strength of each individual standard and additional section,as the
case may be, by keeping in view the teacher-students ratio 1:40 of the entire
school if the teachers strength is required to be increased, the same has to be
allowed, but in no case, the teachers' strength should be less than the number
of standards including the additional sections.  If more teachers are thus
sanctioned keeping in view the over all strength of the school, the authorities
of the school should create additional section in respect of any particular
Standard according to the need and convenience keeping in view the standard of
education.  This requirement is not only in respect of Aided Schools or
Government Schools, but also in respect of any Private Recognised School. In
other words, this ratio is to be maintained for any school which requires
recognition.
</p><p id="p_12">	5)It would be obviously open to the Government to formulate appropriate
norms in consonance with the above observation and provisions of the
Constitution."
</p>
<p id="p_13">	7.Following the above said directions, the learned Single Judge has found
that there was nothing in the counter affidavit dated 05.03.2007, to the Full
Bench decision of this Court which binds not only the appellant but also the
Director of Elementary Education, Chennai as he was a party to the decision.
Relying on Paragraph 23 (2) of the said judgment that the minimum strength of
the teachers required obviously should not fall below the number of
Standards/Section in a school, the learned Single Judge has set aside the order
of transfer and further directed the appellant to re-do the exercise of fixing
norms in the light of the Full Bench judgment cited supra.
</p>
<p id="p_14">	8.The applicability of the Full Bench judgment to the facts of this case
has not been questioned in the memorandum of appeal excepting to repeat that the
norms laid down in the above  G.O.Ms.No.525, School Education (D1) Department
dated 29.12.1997 were followed.  As the fixation of staff strength itself has
been found to be contrary to the Full Bench decision, we do not find that there
is any ground to interfere with the order which is impugned in this appeal.
Accordingly, the writ appeal is dismissed.  No costs. Consequently, M.P.(MD)No.1
of 2008 is also dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_15">	9.Taking into consideration the submission of the learned counsel
appearing for the first respondent that she is working in the second respondent
school without salary since 31.01.2007, the appellant is directed to disburse
the salary and other monetary benefits to the first respondent within a period
of two weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of this order.
