             Mr. S. N. De,
             Mr. Harish Chandra Talwar
                                         ... for the petitioners.

             Mr. Ashit Kumar Chakraborty,
             Mr. Sunanda Mohan Ghosh
                        ... for the respondent nos. 6 and 7.</pre>

<p id="p_1">             Mr. Raja Saha,
             Mr. Amit Kumar Ghosh
                                                  ... for the State.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
             The instant writ application has been filed against an order dated

   15th June, 2018 passed by the Deputy Registrar of Co-operative Societies,

   KMAH, who is also in charge of the duties of the Joint Registrar.

</p><p id="p_3">             Before the said Deputy Registrar the Society had urged a two fold

   points- (a) that the review application was barred by limitation in view of

   the provisions of the 2006 Act and (b) that a direction of the Court dated

   11th May, 2018 in W. P. No. 30007(W) of 2015 was on the Joint Registrar to

   consider the application for review.
</p>
<p id="p_4">             On the aforesaid two questions the Deputy Registrar accepting the

   submissions of the Society held that since the direction was upon the Joint

   Registrar he was not willing to hear out the review application.

</p><p id="p_5">             This Court is surprised at the conduct of the Society as well as the

   manner in which the impugned order has been passed. There is no doubt in

   the mind of this Court that the Society had attempted to frustrate the

   orders of this Court after accepting the same. It is abundantly clear that
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                2</span>

the said Deputy Registrar was also in charge of the duties of the Joint

Registrar and hence should have heard the matter or should have

forwarded the same to the Joint Registrar Housing at the headquarters for

appropriate compliance.
</p>
<p id="p_6">      The objection of the Society is therefore equally baffling.

      On the question of limitation, this Court finds that it was specifically

ordered that the Joint Registrar could hear out the matter on review if the

petitioner had made such application within ten days of the order.

</p><p id="p_7">      If such application was in fact made, the question of any limitation

after the leave of this Court therefore could not have arisen. The conduct

of the Society in this regard is also unacceptable and deprecated.

</p><p id="p_8">      When the issue of maintainability was kept open with liberty to file

such review application it implies to any person reading the order that the

question of limitation was negated by the Court. The other points of

maintainability were, however, kept open to be urged.

</p><p id="p_9">      In the circumstances, the application for review filed by the

petitioner shall stand transmitted to the Joint Registrar, Housing at the

headquarters of the Calcutta New Secretariat Building at Calcutta of the

Co-operative Directorate and shall be heard and disposed of within a period

of one month from the date of communication of a copy of this order.

</p><p id="p_10">      Any step, during the pendency of the review application or

thereafter, taken by the Society shall be deemed null and void. Society
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                3</span>

shall be free to proceed in accordance with law and the 2006 Act after

disposal of the review application.
</p>
<p id="p_11">      This Court has already recorded its dissatisfaction and anguish at the

conduct of the Society. Costs assessed at Rs.25,000/- (Rupees twenty five

thousand) only are called for in this regard. The Society shall pay the said

costs to the petitioner within a period of two weeks from date.

</p><p id="p_12">      In default of payment of the aforesaid amount, no decision or

meeting of the Society shall be held or conducted.

</p><p id="p_13">      In view of the aforesaid direction, W. P. No. 24104 (W) of 2018 is

disposed of.
</p>
<p id="p_14">      Photostat certified copy of this order, if applied for, be given to the

parties upon compliance of all formalities.
</p>
<p id="p_15">
