                ------------------------------------
                W.P.(C). No. 26404 of 2012
             ------------------------------------------
        Dated this the 1st day of December, 2012

                          JUDGMENT
</pre>


<p id="p_1">     Electric connection sought for by the petitioner to a

renovated out house building has not been provided by the

1st respondent insisting upon a court order, in view of the

order of status quo issued by the honourable Supreme

Court. Exhibit P7 is the letter issued in this regard, in which

the petitioner was also requested to produce certain other

documents relating to title of the property and ownership of

the building. The petitioner had produced the title deed, tax

receipt, ownership certificate, building permit etc. along with

this writ petition as Exhibits P1 to P5.         According to the

petitioner insistence for production of court order is totally

unwarranted and unjustified.
</p>
<p id="p_2">     2. Inspite of service of notice from this court nobody

enters appearance on       behalf of the 1st respondent. The

order of the honourable Supreme Court which is referred to

W.P.(C). No. 26404 of 2012
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                -2-</span>



in Exhibit P7 is stated to be an interim order passed in S.L.P.

(C) No. 11582/2007 directing to maintain status quo with

respect to buildings situated within 50 yards from Munnar

River bank.        In the case at hand it is evident that the

building in question stands completed construction on the

basis of a permit granted by the Grama Panchayat

concerned, as per Exhibit P5. Since the building in question

remains completed, providing electric connection to the

building will not legalise the construction in any manner, if it

is otherwise not authorised. Electrification of the building

will not affect proceedings if any initiated by the State or

other competent authorities against the building, if it is

unauthorised. There is no materials to show that any such

proceedings has been initiated against the building in

question. Therefore I am of the view that the petitioner is

entitled to have his application for electric connection

considered on merits.
</p>
<p id="p_3">      3. Hence the writ petition is disposed of directing the

W.P.(C). No. 26404 of 2012
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                 -3-</span>



1st respondent to consider the petitioner's application for

electric connection to his renovated out house building,

without insisting for any court order and to allot connection

subject to priority and on the petitioner fulfilling other

requisite formalities. The needful steps in this regard shall

be taken at the earliest, at any rate within one month from

the date of receipt of a copy of this judgment.

</p><p id="p_4">      4. It is clarified that grant of electric connection will not

regularise or legalise construction of the building in any

manner, if it is not otherwise legal and authorised.             The

State Government or any other authority competent will not

be precluded from taking steps under law for demolition of

the building, because of the electric connection provided, if

such action is otherwise sustainable.
