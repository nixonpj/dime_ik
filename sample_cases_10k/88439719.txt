<p id="p_1">           AUGUSTINE GEORGE MASIH, J. (Oral):
</p>
<p id="p_2">                                Challenge in this appeal is to the judgments and decree

           passed by the Courts below by which the suit of the respondent-

           plaintiffs for declaration to the effect that they are owners in

           possession of the land measuring 5 Kanals 2 Marlas comprised in

           Rectangle No.23, Killa No.6/2 situated at village Shakur, Tehsil and

           District Ferozepur and the alleged sale-deed executed by Karnail

           Singh, proforma respondent No.4/defendant No.1 in favour of

           appellant-defendants No.2 to 4, dated 10.06.1985, regarding

           aforesaid land measuring 5 Kanals 2 Marlas is illegal, null and void

           with consequential relief of permanent injunction restraining the

           appellant-defendants from causing illegal and unlawful interference in

           the land in dispute, stands decreed and the appeal against the said

           decree, stands dismissed.

           RSA No.4427 of 2014 (O&amp;M)




                                It is the contention of the counsel for the appellant-

           defendants No.2 to 4 that both the Courts below have failed to

           appreciate the evidence which has been led by the parties in its true

           perspective and while recording the contentions and findings, have

           only referred to the statements in examination-in-chief and ignored

           the cross-examinations of the witnesses produced by the plaintiffs.

           He, thus, contends that the findings recorded by the Courts below

           cannot sustain as the same are result of misreading of the evidence.

</p><p id="p_4">                                His further contention is that the said judgments being

           contrary to the stand of the parties, cannot sustain especially when

           the suit which has been filed by the respondent-plaintiffs, is beyond

           limitation as it is an admitted fact qua assertions of the respondent-

           plaintiffs that they had come into possession of the land in the year

           1996 and therefore, they could have filed the suit within a period of

           three years thereafter, if there was any dispute in this regard. Prayer

           has, thus, been made for allowing the present appeal by setting

           aside the judgments and decree passed by the Courts below.

</p><p id="p_5">                                This contention of the counsel for the appellant-

           defendants No.2 to 4 cannot be accepted as in the considered view

           of this Court, the evidence has rightly been appreciated by the Courts

           below as has been highlighted by the counsel for the appellant-

           defendants No.2 to 4 with reference to the cross-examinations.

           There are some assertions which appeared to be not in consonance

           with the examination-in-chief but those are not of such nature as

           would impinge upon the credibility of statements which were made by

           them          to     prove   the   stand   of   the   respondent-plaintiffs.   Mild

           discrepancies which have been pointed out by the counsel would not

           effect and impinge upon the purpose and the basis of the suit as

           filed.        The findings as have been recorded by the Courts below

           cannot be faulted with.
</p>
<p id="p_6">                                As regards the contention of the counsel for the

           appellants that the suit is barred by limitation, especially in the light of

           the fact that the respondent-plaintiffs, according to their stand, had

           come into possession of the land in the year 1996, suffice it to say

           that the Courts below have rightly come to the conclusion that the

           suit pertains to declaration seeking themselves to be owners on the

           basis of title where no period of limitation has been prescribed,

           therefore, the said finding also cannot be faulted with.

</p><p id="p_7">                                Both the Courts below have returned concurrent findings

           after properly appreciating the evidence and the same cannot be

           interfered with as there is no perversity or illegality in the same.

</p><p id="p_8">                                No substantial question of law is involved in the present

           appeal. Therefore, finding no merit in the present appeal, the same

           stands dismissed.</p><pre id="pre_2">
