Behra was convicted for an offence under <a href="/doc/1557102/" id="a_1">Section 20(b)</a> of the Narcotic

impugned judgment of his conviction and sentence be set aside and he be

acquitted of the charge framed against him.
</p>
<p id="p_3">            Briefly stated, the prosecution story is that on 7.11.2003, SI

Yashpal Singh from Police Station Ganaur had received a secret

information through a telephonic message that Rameshwar alias Behra

son of Dei Chand, resident of village Agwanpur was engaged in drug

trafficking and was coming from Ganaur side and he could be

apprehended along with the charas; that the said police officer reduced the

secret information into writing, thereafter he along with other police

officials went towards the disclosed place, laying a picket at village

Agwanpur minor; that in the meanwhile accused was spotted coming

from Ganaur side carrying a bag on his shoulder; that on seeing the police

party, he turned back but he was apprehended on the basis of suspicion;

that on being inquired by the Investigating Officer, the accused disclosed

his name, parentage and residential address; that SI Yashpal Singh served

a notice under <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_3">Section 50</a> of the Act upon him informing the accused of

his right to be searched before a gazetted officer or a Magistrate; the

accused opted to be searched in presence of DSP; then SI Yashpal Singh

flashed a V.T. Message to DSP, Ganaur, who came to the spot, SI

Yashpal Singh produced the accused before him; that in presence of DSP,

Ganaur, the bag being carried by the accused was searched by SI Yashpal

Singh, which led to recovery of cardboard box on which New India

Sweets was written in English language; that on being opened it was

found to contain charas; the recovered charas was weighed and it came

out to 1 kg; then SI Yashpal Singh drew two sample of 10 gms. each of



                                    2 of 7
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                 ::: Downloaded on - 08-07-2018 23:54:02 :::</span>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4"> CRA-S-1902-SB-2004                             -3-</span>

the recovered charas; the samples and the remainder were converted into

sealed parcels and sealed with seal of SI Yashpal Singh having inscription

'YP'; that Om Parkash, DSP, Ganaur also affixed his seal on the samples

having inscription 'OP'; that all the three parcels were taken into

possession vide recovery memo attested by the witnesses; that accused

was formally arrested; that ruqa was sent to the police station, on the basis

of which formal FIR was registered; SI Yashpal Singh prepared rough site

plan of the place of recovery; that SI Dayanand had arrived at the spot; SI

Yashpal Singh handed over the accused along with three parcels to him;

statements of witnesses were recorded; SI Dayanand produced the case

property and accused along with witnesses before SHO Prem Singh at

Police Station Ganaur, who affixed his seal having inscription 'PS' on the

sealed parcels; then the case property was deposited with MHC; the

sample parcel was sent to FSL and as per report received therefrom, the

sample was found to be that of charas; that challan was prepared and filed

in the Court.
</p>
<p id="p_4">                On presentation of challan in the Court of Special Judge,

Sonepat, copies of documents relied upon in the challan were supplied to

the accused free of cost as provided under <a href="/doc/1613898/" id="a_4">Section 207</a> Cr.P.C.

</p><p id="p_5">                Learned Special Judge, Sonepat finding that charge for

offence under <a href="/doc/1557102/" id="a_5">Section 20(b)</a> of the Act was disclosed against the accused,

charge-sheeted the accused for the said offence, to which, he pleaded not

guilty and claimed trial. The case was then fixed for evidence of

prosecution.
</p>
<p id="p_6">                To bring home guilt to the accused, the prosecution



                                      3 of 7
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                   ::: Downloaded on - 08-07-2018 23:54:02 :::</span>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6"> CRA-S-1902-SB-2004                            -4-</span>

examined as many as eight witnesses, namely, SI Daya Nand as PW1,

Head Constable Jagdish Parsad as PW2, DSP Om Parkash as PW3,

Constable Jagdish Rai as PW4, Constable Rajesh Kumar as PW5, SHO/SI

Prem Singh as PW6, Constable Azad as PW7 and SI Yashpal Singh as

PW8.
</p>
<p id="p_7">             With that the prosecution evidence stood closed.

             Statement of accused was recorded under <a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_6">Section 313</a>

Cr.P.C., in which all the incriminating circumstances appearing against

him were put to him but he denied the allegations contending that he is

innocent and had been falsely involved in this case.

</p><p id="p_8">             Accused did not lead any evidence in defence.
</p>
<p id="p_9">             After hearing arguments, learned Special Judge, Sonepat

convicted and sentenced the accused as mentioned supra, which left

appellant - accused Rameshwar @ Behra aggrieved and he has filed the

present appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_10">             Learned counsel for the appellant has argued that no

independent witness was joined with the police party despite easy

availability, which cast a doubt over truthfulness of the prosecution story.

</p><p id="p_11">             Whereas learned State counsel has contended that the official

witnesses had no previous enmity with the accused, as such their

depositions be treated at par with the independent witnesses.

</p><p id="p_12">             After hearing learned counsel for the parties, I find that

independent corroboration is a rule of prudence and not requirement of

law. It is no where provided in any statute that independent corroboration

is a must and in absence thereof, the case of the prosecution is to rejected



                                     4 of 7
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                  ::: Downloaded on - 08-07-2018 23:54:02 :::</span>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8"> CRA-S-1902-SB-2004                            -5-</span>

outrightly.
</p>
<p id="p_13">              The second contention raised by learned counsel for the

appellant was that link evidence in this case is missing. Again this is

without any force. PW1 SI Daya Nand stated that on receipt of ruqa, he

had recorded formal FIR and had then gone to the spot, where SI Yashpal

Singh produced accused and sealed parcels before him; that he took over

the investigation in his hand from SI Yashpal Singh and recorded

statements of witnesses, thereafter, produced sealed parcels, accused and

the witnesses before SHO Prem Singh, who had verified the investigation

and affixed his own seal bearing inscription 'PS' on all the three parcels,

thereafter depositing the case property with MHC Police Station Ganaur

and putting the accused in lock up. With seals of SI Yashpal Singh, SI

Daya Nand, DSP Om Parkash and SHO Prem Singh being there and in

view of deposition of SI Daya Nand and affidavits of formal witnesses

PW2 HC Jagdish Parsad and PW5 Constable Rajesh Kumar, it comes out

that no tampering of seals had taken place at any stage till the sample

parcel had reached FSL. Therefore, the argument of learned counsel for

the appellant is devoid of any merit.
</p>
<p id="p_14">              Learned counsel for the appellant has further contended that

the recovery of contraband said to have been effected from accused

amounted to non-commercial quantity but the trial Court without

considering the mitigating circumstances put forward on behalf of the

appellant at the time of considering the quantum of sentence imposed

maximum punishment of 10 years, which is uncalled for.

</p><p id="p_15">              Learned State counsel has countered that contention stating



                                     5 of 7
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                  ::: Downloaded on - 08-07-2018 23:54:02 :::</span>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10"> CRA-S-1902-SB-2004                            -6-</span>

that recovery effected in this case is 1 kg of charas, which amounts to

commercial quantity and the minimum punishment provided has been

awarded to the appellant.
</p>
<p id="p_16">              After hearing the rival contentions, I find that during the trial

it was proved that the recovered charas was 1 kg in weight amounting to

commercial quantity. A perusal of the impugned judgment goes to show

that the circumstances put forward on behalf of the appellant and

considering his age, antecedents and gravity of the offence, the sentence

had been awarded to the appellant. Though learned counsel for the

appellant has argued that the investigation in this case was tainted and

partial but I find little merit in this contention since the Investigating

Officer is not shown to have axe to grind with the accused prompted by

which might have involved the accused in this case wrongly while letting

off the real culprit.
</p>
<p id="p_17">              As far as the citations referred to by learned counsel for the

appellant i.e. Fateh Singh Versus State of Haryana, 2006(2)

R.C.R.(Criminal) 762 and Ratto Versus State of H.P., 2004(1)

R.C.R.(Criminal) 501, those do not find application to the present case

due to different facts and circumstances and the context in which such

observations have been made.
</p>
<p id="p_18">              The impugned judgment of conviction and order of sentence

passed by the trial Court are well reasoned one, based upon proper

appraisal and appreciation of evidence and correct interpretation of law.

There is no illegality or infirmity therein. The said judgment of conviction

and order of sentence are upheld whereas the appeal is found to be



                                     6 of 7

without any merit and the same is dismissed accordingly.

</p><p id="p_19">            Rameshwar alias Behra appellant - accused is stated to be on

bail granted to him by this Court while suspending his sentence. His bail

is cancelled. Chief Judicial Magistrate, Sonepat is directed to issue arrest

warrant to get him arrested so as to make him undergo the remaining

sentence.
