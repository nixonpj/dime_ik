KIRPAL.J
     The  Tirumala   Tirupati  Devasthanams,  the  appellant
herein, started	 Sri Venkateshwara  Balamandir which  is  an
Orphange for  orphans and  destitute children  for providing
free boarding,	lodging, clothing and education upto the age
of 18  years so	 as to enable them to acquire good education
and get	 employment. According	to the	appellants  when  an
inmate/ex-inmate of the Balamandir is qualified and eligible
to a post in Devasthanams, he is considered along with other
inmates as  per the  rules  of	recruitment  in	 vogue.	 The
Executive Officer  of the Devasthanams on 23.4.1980 recorded
proceedings, inter alia, to the effect that every Balamandir
candidate should  be given maximum education and when he has
completed  the	 same,	he   should  be	 provided  with	 the
employment in  Devasthanams as	a matter  of routine without
reference to  Employment Exchange.  It was  Further recorded
that till  they are given jobs in Devasthanams, they will be
continued in the Balamandir.
</p><p id="p_9">     At	 the   request	of  the	 appellant,  the  Government
exempted the  inmates/ex-inmates of  the Balamandir from the
purview of  Employment Exchange by order dated 5.6.1982. The
ex-inmates are those who are discharged from the Balamandir.
Rule 5	of the	Rules framed  by the Devasthanams deals with
discharge from	the Balamandir	and Rule 6, which deals with
personal records and Rule 8 which refers to disqualification
from being entitled to any benefit, are as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">     "5: Discharge
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">     a) All  the inmates  who attain the
     age of 18 years shall be discharged
     at the  end of the academic year in
     which they	 complete the  age of 18
     years;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">     b) In  case the  parent/guardian of
     the inmate	 requests for  premature
     discharge	of   the   inmats   such
     request  will   be	 considered   on
     personal grounds. If the Management
     considers	that   such  request  is
     genuine and justifies the premature
     discharge	of   the  inmates,   the
     discharge may be considered.</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">     c)	 Any  inmate  who  fails  or  is
     detained	any    class   will   be
     discharged forthwith.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">     d)	  Indiscipline	 will	not   be
     tolerated. The Manager, Bala Mandir
     will report  cases of  indiscipline
     to	 the   Devasthanams  Educational
     Officer.	   The	    Devasthanams
     Educational   Officer   will   give
     warning  for   not	 more  than  two
     occasions during  the whole  career
     to the  inmate.  A	 third	case  of
     indiscipline    may    result    in
     discharge.	 Absence   from	  prayer
     without permission	 of the	 Manager
     will be treated as indiscipline.</blockquote>
<p id="p_10">     6) PERSONAL RECORDS
</p><p id="p_11">	----------------
</p><p id="p_12">     "Dosiers"	 will	 have	to    be
     maintained for  each inmate  giving
     out and  particulars of  admission,
     medical   check-up	   report,   and
     progress  report	and   cases   of
     discipline etc. In short, should be
     a personal	 record of the concerned
     inmate during  his stay in the Bala
     Mandir.</p>
<p id="p_13">     a)	 The  personal	record	will  be
     reviewed	by    the   Devasthanams
     Educational Officer once in a year.
</p><p id="p_14">     b) The  personal  records	will  be
     taken  into   consideration   while
     considering the  inmates  case  for
     giving preference in appointment in
     TTD.
</p><p id="p_15">     c)	 The  personal	record	will  be
     received by  the  Dev.  Educational
     Officer once in a year.
</p><p id="p_16">     d) As  far as  possible the inmates
     of Bala  Mandir will be absorbed in
     the various institutions of the TTD
     subject to their being eligible and
     suitable.
</p><p id="p_17">     8) DISQUALIFICATION
</p><p id="p_18">	----------------
</p><p id="p_19">	If an  inmate is  ordered to  be
     removed on the ground of punishment
     or	 on   the  ground  of  admission
     furnishing false  information  such
     inmate shall not be entitled to any
     benefit as	 an inmate  of the  Bala
     Mandir.  An  entry	 shall	be  made
     against this  name in the admission
     register	and    other	relevant
     registers	  to	 indicate    the
     disqualification.
</p><p id="p_20">	The above enclosures, therefore,
     placed   before	the   Management
     Committee	 and   Board   for   its
     approval of  the "Norms  formulated
     now in  regard to S.V. Bala Mandir,
     Tirupati."
</p><p id="p_21">     The respondents being ex-inmates of the Balamandir. who
have filed  separate writ  petitions in	 the High  Court  of
Andhra	Pradesh.   had	been   discharged  from	  the	said
Institution though  they had  not completed their education.
In the	year 1991,  there were 297 vacancies for the post of
Attenders. According  to the  counsel for the appellant, the
practice of  the appellant  was that  all the inmates of the
Balamandir  are	 considered  for  appointment  if  they	 are
qualified without  their having to make any application. The
qualification required for being appointed as an Attender is
that the  candidate should  have Passed	 class VIII. The ex-
inmates were  also entitled to be considered for appointment
and though  they were  not required  to	 apply	through	 the
Employment Exchange  they were	required to  apply directly.
Names were also sponsored by the Employment Exchange and for
the 297	 vacancies, 2944  candidates were  sponsored by	 the
Employment Exchange  and 193 candidates were the inmates and
ex-inmates of  the Balamandir, including the respondents who
were considered.  As the number of candidates were more than
the  number  of	 vacancies,  selection	took  place  by	 the
Authorities by	holding written	 test and  interview. It  is
stated that out of 193 inmates/ex-inmates of the Balamandir,
only 145  appeared at  the written test and interview and 53
from amongst them were selected for the post of Attenders.
</p><p id="p_22">     The respondents.  not  having  been  selected  for	 the
aforesaid Posts of Attenders, filed different writ petitions
which were  disposed of	 by the	 common	 judgment  which  is
impugned in these Appeals. The contention of the respondents
before the High Court was that they should be treated at par
with inmates  end they	should also  be given  preference in
appointment  under   the  Devasthanams.	 On  behalf  of	 the
applicant  the	 recruitment  was  made	 by  selection	from
eligible candidates  and it was brought to the notice of the
High Court that on 30/31.3.1994, the Devasthanam passed
a Resolution  relating to  ex-inmates. The suggestion of the
Sub-Committee. Which  was put before the Devasthahams Board,
is as undr:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_6">     "1. (i)  The inmates  of S.V.  Bala
     Mandir, who  are discharged  edcept
     on the following grounds ned not be
     considered	  as	ex-inmates   for
     sending  call   letters   for   the
     interviews	 and   for  such   other
     benefits, if any.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_7">     (a)  Inmates   with  good	personal
     record and discharged on successful
     Completion of  education and  after
     attaining the  age of  18 years  of
     age.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_8">     (b)  Inmates   with  good	personal
     record but	  discharged  on failure
     in any class.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_9">     (ii) The  orders issued by the then
     Executive	Officer.  TTDs	in  Memo
     Roc.   No.	   E3/10110/79,	   dated
     23.4.1980 regarding the appointment
     of inmates	 of S.V.  Bala Mandir in
     TTDs  service   without  subjecting
     them for  any selection and also to
     continue them  in the orphange till
     them  are	 ginen	jobs   in   t-t-
     Devasthanams may be nullified so as
     to avoid Court litigations.
</blockquote><p id="p_23">On this	 suggestion, the  following Resolution was passed on
30/31.3.1994:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_10">     "Proposal at  (I) may  be	approved
     except that  inmates discharged  on
     failure in	 any class  may	 not  be
     considered as  ex-inmates. Proposal
     (II) also approved."
</blockquote><p id="p_24">The  High   Court  in  our  opinion  rightly,  came  to	 the
conclusion that the aforesaid Resolution of 30/31.3.1994 had
no application	to the	present case  presumably because the
selection had been made for appointment to the 297 vacancies
in the	year 1991.  The High  Court then  gave the following
derection:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_11">     "From  the	  above	 discussion   it
     follows  that   the  cases	 of  the
     former  inmates  will  have  to  be
     considered	 on  the  basis	 of  the
     position	obtaining    under   the
     resolution	   no.	   307,	   dated
     27.10.1984 and  fheir cases have to
     be considered  in terms  of clauses
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_12">     (b) and (d) of Rule(6).
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_13">     In view  of the above writ petition
     No. 13123 of 1993 has to be allowed
     and accordingly, it is allowed.
     Accordingly,  Writ	  petition  Nos.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_14">     7927/92,	 20032/93,     20161/90,
     20499/94,	18205/93,  12498/98  and
     16449/94  are   also  allowed.   No
     costs.</blockquote>
<p id="p_25">     On behalf	of the	appellant, it  is contended that all
the respondents	 were consjdered  for being appointed to the
post of	 Attenders but	they were not found fit. Most of the
persons who  were selected were those who had been sponsored
by the	Emplovment Exchange.  The thrust  of the argument of
Mr. A. Subba Rao, learned counsel for the appellant was that
there could not be any automatic employment given to all the
inmates and ex-inmates and tha clause 6(b) of the Rules only
meant that if all things are equal, then the inmates will be
given preference  for appointment under the Devasthanams. In
the present  case, the effect of allowing the writ petitions
filed by  the respondents  was that  the appellants were now
directed to appoint the respondents as attenders even though
they had  not been  found fit  for such appointments. It may
here be	 noitced that  one  of	the  prayers  in  the  write
petitions was  that the	 non-selection	of  the	 petitioners
should be  treated as  arbitrary and  discriminatory and the
appellants herein  should be  directed to  appoint the	writ
petitioners in	accordance with the existing rules regarding
appointments  of   candidates  to   the	 Balamandir.   While
disposing of  the writ	petitions, the	High Court held that
the writ petitions were allowed. The implication of this was
that the  reliefs prayed  for in  the writ  petitions  stood
granted in toto.
</p><p id="p_26">     It	 is   quite  evident   from  the   facts  enumerated
hereinabove that no prejuduce could be regarded to have been
caused to  the respondents  by their  being regarded  as ex-
inmates. the  total number of vacancies which were avainable
were more  than the  total number  of  candidates  who	were
inmates and  ex-inmates. It  is unfortunate  that these	 in-
house candidates  were not  selected. Clause  (b) of  Rule 6
which refers  to preference  being given  to the  inmates in
appointment in	the Devasthanams  does not  and cannot imply
that irrespective  of the  merits  of  the  candidates,	 the
inmates have  to be  given appointments. The appellants have
rightly resorted  to the  procequre of making selection from
the inmates,  ex-inmates and  general  candidates  who	were
eligible, by  holding written  test/interviews and  clause 6
can only  mean that  with the merits of the candidates being
equal,preference would	be gibven  to  the  inmates  of	 the
Balamandir.
</p><p id="p_27">     The reference  by the  High Court to the proceedings of
the Executive  Officer on  23.4.1980 is also mis-placed. The
passage on which reliance is placed is as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_15">     "Some of  the  present  inmates  of
     S.V.  Bala	 Mandir,  Tirupati  have
     appeared for interview on 12.2.1980
     for appointment  in TTD though they
     are still studying in the college.
     The of  the present inmates of S.V.
     Bala Mandir,  Tirupati is	informed
     that  the	 mase  of   the	 present
     inmates  of   S.V.	  Bala	 Mandir,
     Tirupati  for  appointment	 in  TTO
     will  be	considered  after  their
     completion of  studies. Every  Bala
     Mandir candidate should be given
     maximum education	he would like to
     have. As and when he finished the
     education,	 he  would  be	provided
     emplovment in  TTO as  a matter  of
     routine   without	  reference   to
     Employment, Exchange. Till they are
     givan jobs	 in TTD,  they	will  be
     continued in the Bala Mandir.
     Every  year  the  Special	officer,
     S.V. Bala	mandir, will send a list
     three or  four  months  in	 advance
     about all	the candidates who would
     be	   completing	 education    or
     completing their  age and	eligable
     for employment."</blockquote>
<p id="p_28">     The aforesaid  proceedings merely state that interviews
were held  for appointment under the Devasthanms even as far
back as in 1981. It further states that the p resent inmates
will be considered for appointment after their completion of
studies and  they will	be given  emplovment as	 a matter of
routine without	 reference to  the Employment  Exchange. The
very fact  that interviews were held even in 1991 shows that
the suitability	 of the candidates for appointment had to be
jugged and  that appointment  of the  inmates/ex-inmales was
not  automatic.	  On  the  facts  of  the  present  case,the
distinction  between   inmates	and  ex-inmates	 looses	 all
relenance because 193 inmates/ex-inmates were considered for
appointment and	 53 of	them were selected. In comparison to
the candidates	who  were  selected,  the  respondents	were
obviously not  found to	 be equally meritorious. Counsel for
the respondent	has not	 been able to show that at any point
of time,  there was  a promise	or an obligation on the part
of Devasthanams to give employment to the inmates,even if it
is presumed  that the  ex-inmates like the respondents	have
to  be	 treated  at  par  with	 the  inmates.	Under  these
circumstances, the  High Court	clearly erred in issuing the
direction which	 had the  effect of  granting appointment to
the rospondents	 even though  they were	 considered but were
not found  to be  fit for selection. The High Court ought to
have held  that there  could be	 no automatic  employment of
inmates and ex-inmates by the appellant and that they had to
go through  a process of selection. There was a selection in
the year  1991 when the respondents were considered but were
found not  to be  fit for selection and no relief could have
been granted to the respondennts
     The appeals  are  accordingly,  allowed.  The  impugned
Judgment of the High Court is set aside, the effect of which
is that	 the writ  petitions filed  by the respondents shall
stand dismissed.  There shall be no order as to costs.
