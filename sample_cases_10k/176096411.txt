is that, the accident has not occurred due to rash and negligent

driving of the driver of the tempo trax.       Further another

defence of the respondent No.1 is that, at the time of accident,

the petitioner was traveling in the alleged vehicle as an

unauthorized passenger and as such, the owner of the vehicle

has violated the policy conditions. To prove the said fact, the

respondent No.1 has not produced any supportive documents. On

the other hand, to prove the rash and negligent driving of the

driver of the alleged tempo, the petitioner has relied upon the

copy of police investigation papers and on perusal of those

documents, it is clear that the alleged accident has occurred due

to sole negligence on the part of the driver of the alleged tempo

and also it reveals that, at the time of accident, the petitioner

was traveling in the said tempo on duty. Further he argued that

to prove the disablement suffered by the petitioner, he has

examined Dr.C.V.Kumar as PW-2 and as per the version of the

doctor, the petitioner has suffered disability to the extent of

20% to the whole body. Further he argued that, to prove the

occupation and income, the petitioner has examined the Bank

employee as PW-6 and he has produced the sufficient documents

regarding the income of the petitioner and the petitioner has

proved his case as contended in the petition by producing oral

and documentary evidence.     Accordingly, he prays to allow the

petition.
</p>
<p id="p_20">      13.   In support of his argument, he has produced the copy

of order sheet in MVC.No.4486/2015 and copy of joint memo

filed in the said case.

submitted his argument and as such, the argument of respondent

No.2 is taken as heard.

case, the petitioner has examined himself as P.W.1 and he has
