     Shri R.K. Sharma, learned senior Advocate along
with Shri Arshad Ali, learned counsel for the applicant.
      Shri Vivek Bhargava, learned Public Prosecutor for
the respondent-State.</pre>
<p id="p_1">     Case Diary is perused.
</p>
<p id="p_2">     Learned counsel for the rival parties are heard.
     The applicant has filed this                second bail application
u/S 439, <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_1">Cr.P.C</a>. for grant of bail. The applicant has been

Prevention of Damage to the Public Property Act, 1984.
Earlier first bail application was dismissed as withdrawn
vide order dated 12/06/2018 passed in M.Cr.C. No.
21243/2018 with liberty to revive after filing of the charge
sheet.
</p><p id="p_3">     Prosecution story in short is that on 24/03/2018 at
about 10.00 am Police Station Ambah received                         an
information that in village Barwai, Ambah, villagers about
200-250 in    numbers have confined two persons namely
Bablu and Sugreev in connection with abduction of girl
named Laxmi and they all were beating brutally by Lathi,
Danda and kicks and fists. Police force went on the spot
and tried to rescue Bablu and Sugreev. At that time about
400-500 persons attacked on the police force by Lathi and
Danda and also pelted stones as a result of which various
police persons received injuries and also damaged the
                                             THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH

         government vehicles. On the aforesaid crime has been
         registered.
</p><p id="p_4">               Counsel for the applicant submits that he is an
         innocent person and has not committed any crime. The
         applicant has not been named in the FIR and no specific
         over-tact is attributed to the applicant. No weapon has
         been seized from possession of the applicant and even TIP
         has not been conducted during the investigation. The
         applicant was not present at the spot and was getting
         treatment at Shamsabad and he has no criminal history.
         The applicant is in custody since 24/03/2018. On these
         grounds, he prays for bail.
</p><p id="p_5">               Learned Public Prosecutor for the State opposed the
         application and prayed for its rejection by contending that
         name of the applicant finds place in 161 statements.
         Applicant alongwith others had taken the law in their
         hands by attacking on the police force and pelted stones
         and damaged the government property, therefore, he
         prays that bail may not be granted to the applicant.
</p><p id="p_6">               Taking into consideration the facts and circumstances
         of the case, gravity of the offence is required to be seen,
         but without expressing any opinion on the merits of the
         case, I find that it is not a fit case for grant of bail.
</p><p id="p_7">               Accordingly, the bail application is hereby dismissed.
               Cc as per rules.
