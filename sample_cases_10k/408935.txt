</pre>

<p id="p_1">Koshy,J.
</p>
<p id="p_2">            The appellant/petitioner was working as U.P.S.A. From

24.11.1986. In 1994-95 an audit objection was raised that the petitioner

was an excess hand and, therefore, no salary was paid after 15.7.1994.

In view of the fact that a vacancy arose due to promotion, she could have

continued and, therefore, later the audit objections were withdrawn. In

1995-96, there was further reduction in division and she was not given

salary in 1995-96. But, in view of the Government Order, she was given

notional   protection    with      effect       from       15.2.1996.  Petitioner's

representations were considered in Ext.P4 which reads as follows:




</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">           "......... Government have examined the case in
           detail in consultation with the Director of Public
           Instruction.    The petitioner was thrown out with
           effect from 15.7.94 due to the reduction of post
           during 94-95 consequent on the audit objection. But
           subsequently the audit objection was dropped.
           Smt.Rehiyanath Beevi would have continued in the
           school during 94-95 if there was no audit objection.
           The audit objection was subsequently dropped. If
           she would have continued in the school during 94-

<blockquote id="blockquote_2">           95, she could complete years of service during
           94-95 and could have enjoyed the benefit of
           protection as per GO(MS) 60/96/GE dt. 20.2.96.
           Unfortunately she was thrown out with effect
           from 15.7.94, and it was not due to her fault or
           management but due to the audit objection which
           was dropped later.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">                 In the circumstances, Government find
           merit in the representation read as 2nd paper
           above and are pleased to retain Smt.Rahiyanath
           Beevi as UPSA in VVHS Ayathil with effect from
           15.7.94 to 31.3.95 on condition that her service
           benefits will be given notionally for the year 94-
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">           95.   During   95-96   thee    was    no   post   to
           accommodate her in the school. The protection
           order issued in G.O.(MS)No.60/96/GE dt. 15.2.96
           has only prospective effect. Therefore she will
           be given notional protection with effect from
           15.2.96 onwards.     The period from 1.4.95 to
           14.2.96 will be treated as eligible leave or leave
           without allowance."
</blockquote>



<p id="p_3">Learned single Judge considered the same. Considering the fact that

the audit objection raised from the Accountant General's office was

later dropped in the light of Exhibit P10 letter written by the DEO, the

Government decided to treat the entire period as on duty and the

petitioner was retained as UPSA for the period from 4.11.1994 to

31.3.1995, on condition that her service benefits will be given only

notionally for the year 1994-95. It is also clear that because of this

factual position, she had been thrown out during 1994, she could not

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">W.A.2597/2005                       3</span>

get the benefit of the order granting protection (Order dated 20-2-

1996). Exhibit P4 recites that the petitioner was thrown out only on

account of the fact that there was audit objection which was later

withdrawn. No doubt, it was noted that it was not due to her fault or

that of the management, it happened. In such circumstances, the

impugned orders cannot        be sustained fully.     Contention of the

petitioner is that in view of the vacancy that occurred            due to

promotion based on which audit objection was withdrawn, she

continued in the service.     Students also cannot be left without a

teacher.     Ext.P10 shows that she was marking attendance

continuously. The fact is that she was discharging the duties of the

teacher during the period. Merely because of the wrong audit

objection which was admittedly withdrawn, she cannot be denied

salary for the period from 15.7.1994 to 31.3.1995. Therefore, we

direct the respondents to disburse her salary from 15.7.1994 to

31.3.1995 also. Even audit objection was made not because of her

fault and the audit objection was withdrawn.           Actually, she was

working during the above period. However, for the period 1995-96

she is not entitled to salary but only for the benefit of protection order

with effect from 15.2.1996. Therefore, Ext.P4 is modified. She is also

entitled salary for the period from 15.7.1994 to 31.3.1995. The salary

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">W.A.2597/2005                       4</span>

should be disbursed within three months from the date of receipt of a

copy of this judgment.
