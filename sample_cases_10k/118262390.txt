</pre><p id="p_1"> BRIEF   STATEMENT   OF   THE   REASONS   FOR   THE   DECISION   OF 
THE CASE:
</p>
<p id="p_2">1.      The complainant has filed the present complaint case against the accused 

alleging offence  u/s.  138 of <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_4">Negotiable  Instruments  Act (NI  Act</a>).    Case of 

complainant is that he entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) 

with accused for jointly executing the work of construction at a site in Panipat 

(Haryana)   and   he   agreed   to   invest   a   sum   of   Rs.10   lacs   as   per   said   MOU. 

Complainant gave a sum of Rs.7,50,000/­ to the accused and accused issued 

two post dated cheques of Rs.3,75,000/­ each bearing no. 838024 dt. 29.9.08 

and 838025 dt. 3.10.08 both drawn on State Bank of Bikaner and Jaipur, Ajmal 

Khan   Road,   Karol   Bagh,   New   Delhi.   The   cheques   were   given   as 

security/receipt of the said amount. It is alleged that complainant came to know 

that   accused   was   utilizing   the   money   given   to   him   for   his   personal 

requirements. After lengthy discussions, accused agreed to return the aforesaid 

amount   of   Rs.7,50,000/­   to   complainant.   Accused   requested   complainant   to 

present   above   noted   two   cheques   for   encashment     in   October,   2008.   One 

cheque bearing no. 838024 was presented for encashment but was dishonoured 

for   the   reasons   ¨insufficient   funds¨   vide   memo   dt.   4.10.08.   Complainant 

contacted accused who issued three more cheques for the said amount. It is 

stated that accused issued cheque no. 402951 in back date i.e. 1.9.2008 for Rs.

1,00,000/­   ;   and   cheque   no.   402952   for   Rs.2,00,000/­   dt.   7.10.08   and   third 

cheque for Rs.75,000/­. These three cheques were drawn on ICICI Bank Ltd., 

Defence Colony branch, Delhi.

</p><p id="p_4"> 2.      Complainant   presented   cheque   no.   402951   on   the   same   day   but   was 

dishonoured   for   the   reasons   ¨insufficient   funds¨   vide   memo   dt.   4.10.08. 

Complainant again contacted accused who asked complainant to present cheque 

no. 838025 for Rs.3,75,000/­.   The said cheque was also presented but was 

again dishonoured for the reason ¨Insufficient Funds¨ vide memo dt. 6.10.08. 

Complainant   again   questioned   accused   who   asked   complainant   to   present 

cheque no. 402952. The said cheque was also dishonoured for the same reason 

vide memo dt. 10.10.08.
</p>
<p id="p_5">3.      Complainant   informed   accused   who   apologized   and   sought   20   days 

time. Later complainant presented the two cheques of Rs.1,00,000/­ and Rs.

2,00,000/­ but both were dishonoured for the reasons ¨payment stopped¨ vide 

memos dt. 5.11.08. Again when complainant contacted accused, the accused 

asked   him   to   present   the   earlier   cheque   of   Rs.3,75,000/­.   Yet   again   on 

presentation,   this   cheque   was   also   dishonoured   for   the   reasons   ¨insufficient 

funds¨   vide   memo   dt.   10.11.08.   Again   accused   expressed   his   apology   and 

assured complainant to pay the amount within one month. Complainant submits 

that cheque of Rs.75,000/­ was duly honoured. 
</p>
<p id="p_6">4.      After about one month complainant presented the cheque no. 838024 for 

Rs.3,75,000/­ but again it was dishonoured for the reason ¨insufficient funds¨. 

Accused   assured   to   pay   the   amount   of   Rs.3,00,000/­   within   one   week. 

Complainant is not seeking any relief with respect to this cheque. 

</p><p id="p_7">5.      After one week complainant presented the other two cheques i.e. for Rs.

1,00,000/­ and Rs.2,00,000/­ which were dishonoured for the reasons ¨payment 


CC No. 230/13                       D.D. Sharma Vs. Amardeep Singh                Page 3 of  6
 stopped¨   vide   memo   dt.   24.12.08.   On   request   of   accused,   complainant 

presented cheque no. 838025 for Rs.3,75,000/­ after one week but it was again 

dishonoured vide memo dt. 31.12.08.
</p>
<p id="p_8">6.      Thereafter also, on request of accused, complainant presented the three 

cheques i.e. 838025 for Rs.3,75,000/­, 402951 for Rs. 1,00,000/­ and 402952 

for   Rs.2,00,000/­.   The   cheque   for   Rs.3,75,000/­   was   dishonoured   for   the 

reasons ¨insufficient funds¨ and the other two cheques were dishonoured for the 

reason ¨stop payment¨ vide memo dt. 17.1.09 and 19.1.09 respectively.  

</p><p id="p_9">7.      Ultimately   complainant   sent   legal   notice   dt.   28.1.09.   After   receiving 

legal notice, accused paid Rs.50,000/­ to the complainant out of total amount of 

Rs.6,75,000/­.   Accused   thereafter   did   not   make   any   payment.   Hence,   this 

complaint case.
</p>
<p id="p_10">8.      Complainant was examined as CW1. Ex.CW1/1 is the MOU. Ex.CW1/2 

is the cheque no. 838024. Ex.CW1/3 is cheque no. 838025 and Ex.CW1/4 is its 

return memo. Ex.CW1/5 and 6 are cheques nos. 402951 and 402952 and their 

return memos are Ex.CW1/7 and 8 respectively. Ex.CW1/9 is copy of legal 

notice dt. 28.1.2009. Ex.CW1/10 to 13 are postal receipts of Regd. AD, Speed 

Post, Courier and UPC. Legal notice was sent at residential address of accused.

</p><p id="p_11">9.      Complainant also examined CW2 Sanni Lal from State Bank of Bikaner 

&amp; Jaipur who produced account opening form of A/c No. 17155. It was in the 

name   of   Smt.   Harbans   Kaur   and   accused   Amardeep   Singh.   Record   is 

Ex.CW2/1. 
</p>
<p id="p_12">10.   Accused was summoned for the offence u/s. 138 <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_5">NI Act</a>. 


CC No. 230/13                       D.D. Sharma Vs. Amardeep Singh               Page 4 of  6
</p><p id="p_13"> 11.     Summons   were   ordered   to   be   issued   to   the   accused.   Earlier   accused 

could   not   be   found   and   was   declared   a   proclaimed   offender   vide   order   dt. 

26.9.12. Later he appeared and on his application, proceedings u/s. 82 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_6">Cr.PC</a> 

were recalled vide order dt. 15.4.2013. 
</p>
<p id="p_14">12.     Notice of accusation was served upon accused on 4.7.13 for the offence 

punishable u/s. 138 <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_7">NI Act</a> to which accused pleaded not guilty and claimed 

trial.   Case was tried summarily in view of judgment "Rajesh Aggarwal  Vs. 

The State &amp; Anr.". Defence of accused was also recorded. However, he did not 

file any application u/s. 145(2) <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_8">NI Act</a>. As such matter was fixed for defence 

evidence. 
</p>
<p id="p_15">13.     Accused did not examine any witness. Hence, DE was closed. 

</p><p id="p_16">14.     I have heard Ld. Counsels for complainant and accused.

</p><p id="p_17">15.     Defence of accused was that complainant had not given the promised 

amount of Rs.7,50,000/­ and paid only Rs.3,50,000/­ and he had repaid some of 

the   amount.   The   accounts   were   to   be   settled.   Loss   &amp;   Profits   were   to   be 

determined. As this was not done, accused had stopped the payment of the 

cheques which was only collateral security. He stated that there was no liability 

in respect of those cheques. 
</p>
<p id="p_18">16.     Accused   had   also   raised   question   of   limitation   which   was   decided 

against accused vide order dt. 4.7.13. 
</p>
<p id="p_19">17.     It was upon the accused to establish his defence. As the accused has 

failed   to   examine   any   witness,   adverse   inference   has   to   be   drawn   against 

accused. There is presumption of liability which accused has not been able to 


CC No. 230/13                       D.D. Sharma Vs. Amardeep Singh                  Page 5 of  6
 rebut. Complainant has proved his case. The complainant has fairly restricted 

his claim to Rs.6,25,000/­ as he had received Rs.75,000/­ on one occasion and 

Rs.50,000/­ on the other occasion. 
</p>
<p id="p_20">18.     Thus accused is held guilty and is therefore convicted u/s. 138 <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_9">NI Act</a>. 

</p><p id="p_21">19.     Let he be heard on sentence.
