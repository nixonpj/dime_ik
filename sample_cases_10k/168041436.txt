                         BENCH AT INDORE

                         M.Cr.C No.25760/2018

                     (Munnawar Vs. State of MP)

Indore: 25.07.2018
     Shri A.Joshi, learned counsel for the applicant.
     Shri    Suraj     Sharma,   learned   counsel   for   the
respondent/State.
     Heard with the aid of case diary.
                            ORDER
</pre><p id="p_1">     As per statement made by the accused/applicant, this
is the sole bail application under <a href="/doc/1783708/" id="a_1">Section 438</a> of Cr.P.C.
before High Court in connection with Crime No.187/2017
under <a href="/doc/704277/" id="a_2">Section 8</a>/<a href="/doc/1046310/" id="a_3">15</a> of the NDPS Act registered at Police
Station-Industrial Area, District-Ratlam. No other bail
application has been preferred by him.
</p><p id="p_2">2.   It is submitted by the learned counsel for the
applicant that the applicant is innocent and has falsely
been implicated in the present case. There is no evidence
against him. Conclude of trial is likely to take time. The

applicant is permanent resident of District-Ratlam. There is
no possibility of his absconding. He is ready to furnish
adequate security, therefore, he may be released on bail.
</p><p id="p_3">3.   The Prosecution has opposed the bail application.
</p><p id="p_4">4.   Learned counsel for the applicant made statement at
Bar that no criminal antecedent is attributed to the
applicant.
</p><p id="p_5">5.   According to the prosecution case, the present
applicant has been impleaded in the array of accused
persons for having 766 Kgs of Poppy Husk in his possesion
for which he was not having any license. The present
applicant is implicated only on the basis of disclosure
statement of co-accused Mukesh. He was not found on the
    spot and nothing is recovered from his possession.
</p><p id="p_6">   6.        In   view   of   the   aforesaid   and   other   facts   and
   circumstances of the present case, without commenting on
   merits, at this stage, I find it to be a fit case for grant of
   anticipatory bail to the applicant.
</p><p id="p_7">   7.        Accordingly, the bail application is allowed and it is
   directed that in the event of the applicant's arrest or
   surrender before the police within a month of this order,

   the applicant Munnawar S/o Gulab Khan Mewati shall be
   released on bail on his furnishing a personal bond of

   Rs.1,00,000/- (Rupees One Lakh Only) with one solvent
   surety of the like amount to the satisfaction of Station
   House Officer of the Police Station concerned. The
   applicant would abide by the conditions mentioned in
   <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_4">Section 438</a> (2) <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_5">Cr.P.C</a>.
