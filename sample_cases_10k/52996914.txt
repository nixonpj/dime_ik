<p id="p_1">	The Oriental Insurance Company is the appellant in the above appeal  challenging the award and decree dated  02.12.2005 passed in M.C.O.P. No. 395 of 2004  on the file of the  (Additional District  Judge), Fast Track Court, Thirupathur.  
</p>
<p id="p_2">	2. It is a case of a fatal accident. The accident occurred on 09.09.2001. One Mohammed Hashim @ Babu was proceeding in the Yamaha Motor Cycle bearing Registration No: TCD 3648 along with one pillion rider namely Ameerjohn.  He was proceeding from Kaveripattinam to Krishnagiri in the Krishnagiri NH Road.  At about 23.00 hours, when he was proceeding near Kaveripattinam on the Thenpennai river bridge, the tempo traveller bearing Regn. No: TN 29D 0900 belonging to the 4th respondent herein and insured with the appellant herein, being driven by its driver in a rash and negligent manner in the opposite direction suddenly hit on the Yamaha Motorcycle resulting in the accident. Due to the impact, both Mohammed Hashim @ Babu and Ameerjohn, the pillion rider, were thrown out of the vehicle to a distance and sustained injuries on the vital organs.  The Yamaha motorcycle was also completely damaged.  Immediately, both the injured were taken to the Government Hospital at Krishnagiri where the pillion rider Ameerjohn died within a few hours of his admission.  As Mohammed Hashim @ Babu's condition was serious, he was taken to St. John's Hospital at Bangalore, where he died on 10.09.2001.   The legal heirs of the deceased Mohammed Hasim had filed the claim petition, claiming a sum of Rs. 50,00,000/-.  
</p>
<p id="p_3">	3.   According to the claimants, the  deceased was aged 40 years at the time of accident and was earning a sum of Rs.40,000/- per month as a working partner in Roshan Granites &amp; Co. (Granite Exports), Krishnagiri and was also a partner in New Cinema Theatre, Tirupattur.    
</p>
<p id="p_4">	4.  In support of the claim, the claimants have examined P.Ws.1 to P.W.4 and marked Exs.P-1 to P-12, the details of which are as follows:-
</p>
<p id="p_5">Ex.P-1 is the copy of First Information Report
Ex.P-2 is the accident register 
Ex.P-3 is the copy of the vehicle permit 
Ex.P-4 is the copy of the insurance policy
Ex.P-5 is the copy of the tax receipt in respect
	of the Cinema Theatre

Ex.P-6 is the copy of the driving licence of the deceased

Ex.P-7 is the copy of the medical records

Ex.P-8 is the copy of the documents showing that the
	deceased was the partner in Granite Co.
</p>
<p id="p_6">Ex.P-9 is the copy of tax receipt in the name of the 
	deceased as partner in the Cinema Theatre

Ex.P-10 is the copy of the judgment in M.C.O.P. No:
</p><p id="p_7">	1727 of 2001 of the Subordinate Judge,
	Krishnagiri.
</p>
<p id="p_8">Ex.P.11 is the copy of the document showing the 
	deceased as partner in the Granite Company

Ex.P.12 is the copy of the document showing that the 
	deceased was an income tax assessee
 
On the side of the respondents, one witness was examined as R.W. 1  and one document viz. Investigation report  was marked as Ex.R.1. 
</p>
<p id="p_9">	5.   Before the Tribunal, the appellant filed counter statement contending that the accident had not occurred in the place and manner as claimed by the claimants; that the place of the accident is 100 yards away from Kaveripattinam Police Station; that the accident is said to have taken place at 11.00 p.m. on 09.09.2001 but, the  First Information Report  was lodged only at 10.00 a.m. on 10.09.2001 and that there is unexplained delay in lodging the complaint.   The appellant also sought to dispute the correctness of the age and income of the deceased as claimed by the claimants as also the negligent aspect. 
</p>
<p id="p_10">	6.  On the negligence aspect, the Tribunal came to hold that the driver of the tempo traveller was rash and negligent in driving and that, he was the cause of the accident which resulted in the death of the deceased, on which there appears to be no serious dispute as it is supported by material evidence marked in this case as Ex.P.1 to P.4. 
</p>
<p id="p_11">	7.  So far as the claim of a sum of Rs.50 lakhs is concerned, the Tribunal held as follows :-

</p><p id="p_13">	8.  Based on the above amount fixed as monthly income of the deceased, the Tribunal had granted the following sum as compensation under various heads :-
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_1"> 1</span>
<p id="p_14">Towards loss of  dependancy
Rs.7,00,005/-
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">2</span>
<p id="p_15">Towards funeral expenses 
Rs.   15,000/-</p><pre id="pre_2">
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">3</span>
Towards loss of consortium
Rs.     5,000/-
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">4</span>
Loss of love and affection ( 2 x 2,500)
Rs.     5,000/-

Total
Rs.7,25,005/-

	 
</pre><p id="p_16">	9.   A perusal of the materials produced reveals that though the claimants pleaded that the deceased was earning a monthly income of Rs.40,000/- viz. Each Rs.20,000/- from the Granite firm and Rs.20,000/- from the Cinema theatre, the Tribunal had only fixed a sum of Rs.70,000/- as his yearly income and after deducting one third towards his personal expenses, fixed a sum of Rs.46,667/- as his yearly contribution to the family and arrived at a sum of Rs.7,00,005/- [ Rs.46,667/- x 15 = Rs.7,00,005/-]  towards loss of dependency.  While the Tribunal had granted a sum of Rs. 15,000/- for the funeral expenses, it had granted only a meagre sum of Rs. 5,000/- towards loss of consortium to the wife and Rs.2,500/- each to the minor child  and unmarried sister of the deceased towards loss of love and affection.  There can be no doubt that the sum granted by the Tribunal towards loss of consortium and loss of love and affection are very meagre and this Court finds no reason to interfere with the aforesaid sum.     
</p>
<p id="p_17">	10.  Accordingly, finding no merit, this Civil Miscellaneous Appeal is dismissed. Connected miscellaneous petition is closed.  There shall be no order as to the costs.  The appellant is directed to deposit the entire award amount less the amount already deposited within three months.  On such deposit the claimants 1 and 3 are permitted to withdraw the same as apportioned by the Tribunal.  The share of the minor claimant is directed to be deposited in any nationalised bank till she attains majority.  </p><pre id="pre_3">
