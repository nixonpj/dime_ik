                  W.P.(C) No. 7353 of 2014
              ----------------------------------------
                Dated this the 6th day of August, 2014

                            JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">                  The petitioners are autorickshaw drivers who used

to park their autorickshaws at Market Junction, Kaduthuruthy. It is

the contention of the petitioners that Ext.P1 series of permits issued

to the petitioners and as per them Market Junction, Kaduthuruthy is

shown as the place for parking of their respective autorickshaws.

This writ petition is filed on being aggrieved by the steps taken by

respondents 1 and 2 to issue building permit to the third respondent

to construct an open air stage in the parking area alloted to park the

petitioners vehicles. The petitioners seek issuance of writ of

mandamus commanding the respondents 1 and 2              not to issue

permit to the third respondent to construct        open air stage in

Kaduthuruthy Market Junction and direction to the third respondent

not to construct open air stage at Kaduthuruthy Market Junction in a

way adversely affecting their interest and diminishing parking place

of their autorickshaws and that of other similarly situated

autorickshaw drivers. Separate counter affidavits have been filed by

W.P.(C) No. 7353 of 2014
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                  2</span>

the 3rd and 4th respondents. In the counter affidavit filed by the third

respondent it is specifically stated that the property      in question

belongs to the Irrigation Department, and it is not earmarked as a

parking place for autorickshaws by the authorities concerned. The

place in question is having an extent of 10 cents. In view of the said

assertive statement and in the absence of any contra evidence it can

only be taken that the autorickshaw drivers used to park their

vehicles there without authorization. Going by the counter affidavit

no coercive steps were taken against the petitioners and other

autorickshaw drivers who used to park their autorickshaws there.

Taking note of the fact that Kaduthuruthy Market junction is a busy

place and there is no paucity of space for parking such vehicles. It

is also stated therein that taking into consideration the traffic

congestion in the area and to facilitate hassle free traffic in that

area it was decided that the sides of Chullithodu should be

developed by increasing the width of the road and by constructing

culvert over the Thodu as also by making a path way on the sides of

the road with the consensus from allied department like the PWD,

Panchayath (LSGD) etc. utilizing the Government fund. The plan for

W.P.(C) No. 7353 of 2014
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                   3</span>

construction of the side walls of the Chullithodu      which is in a

dilapidated condition    was proposed by the local MLA       and the

Panchayath member and the same was subsequently approved by

the Government for an amount of Rs.25,00,000/- . It is also

specifically stated therein that the open air stage was also proposed

to be erected as a part of the supporting wall to be constructed and

the same would not be in any way affect the parking of the

autorickshaws or movements of the pedestrians in the area. That

apart, it is stated that 10 cents of land belonging to the Irrigation

Department is not an authorized parking place for autorickshaws

and therefore it can only be said that the petitioners and the other

auto rickshaw drivers are encroached upon the land and parking

their vehicles unauthorisedly. Even, Ext.P1 series of permits issued

in favour of the petitioners by the 4th respondent would only reveal

that they were allowed to park their respective autorickshaws at

Market Junction, Kaduthuruthy.       It can not   be construed as a

permission granted        by the 4th respondent to take such

autorickshaws and park it inside the property belonging to the third

respondent. In that context, it is relevant to refer to the counter

W.P.(C) No. 7353 of 2014
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                   4</span>

affidavit filed by the 4th respondent. It is stated in paragraph 4 of the

counter affidavit that about 200 autorickshaws obtained permission

from the Sub RTO, Vaikom with the parking space at Kaduthuruthy

and in addition to that about 40 vehicles also obtained the stand

permit specifically at Kaduthuruthy Market Junction. It is        stated

therein that the land is owned by the Irrigation Department and

therefore it is for them to decide in what manner it is to be used. It

is further stated therein that in the meanwhile, the inconvenience

and problems due to the present halting of            autorickshaws    at

Kaduthuruthy Market Junction has to be resolved by finding any

other suitable parking place in the Panchayath and the same has to

be found out and additionally prepared by the infrastructure

development, by the Panchayath. It is also stated that re-locating

the parking place for the autorickshaws belonging to the petitioners

and the other autorickshaw drivers who obtained permit to park

their autorickshaws at Kaduthuruthy Market Junction is a matter to

be decided by the Kaduthuruthy Panchayath and the Traffic

Regulatory authority of the concerned area. Till the construction of

a new stand, according to the 4th respondent, the existing

W.P.(C) No. 7353 of 2014
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                    5</span>

autorickshaws could be allowed to park in the existing parking place

without obstructing the work of the Irrigation Department in their

land, after identifying the boundaries. Thus, it is evident from the

rival pleadings and submissions made by both sides that with

respect to the ownership of the property in question there is

absolutely no dispute and admittedly it belongs to the Irrigation

Department and the place in question is having an extent of 10

cents. What prompted the authority to take a decision to effect

certain renovation works and developmental activities is evident

from the counter affidavit filed by the third respondent. To reveal

the dilapidated condition of the retention wall on the sides of

Chullithodu the third respondent has produced a photograph and it

definitely reflects the real urgency for carrying out the renovation

works. Going by the affidavit while effecting such a construction on

that side a stage could be constructed, along with the side of the

wall after its construction. It is further evident from the counter

affidavit that as on today there is no proposal to take any coercive

steps against the petitioners or the other autorickshaw drivers and

evidently the affidavit filed by the respondents 3 and 4 would reveal

W.P.(C) No. 7353 of 2014
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                    6</span>

that any such action would be taken only, in accordance with law,

taking into account the fact that for the past several years the

autorickshaws are        being used to park there. In the said

circumstances , I am of the view that the proposed developmental

activities has to go on for the larger interest of the public and it will

be open to the third respondent and the other competent authorities

to proceed with such proposal and to effect constructions, taking

into account the admitted position that the land in question belongs

to the Irrigation Department. In case of necessity it will be open

them to take appropriate action to see that vehicles are not parked

in the land in question. At the same time, such coercive steps shall

be taken only after identifying and allotting other parking place for

parking the autorickshaws.
