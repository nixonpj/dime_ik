                         W.A.No.2315 of 2004
                  ----------------------------------------
                        Dated 16th March, 2010

                               JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">Balakrishnan Nair, J.
</p>
<p id="p_2">            The appellant is the writ petitioner.     He was a Technical

Assistant in the Fisheries Department at the time of filing the Writ

Petition.  His next promotion post in the direct line of promotion is

Superintendent. He is also eligible to be considered for promotion to the

post of Research Officer/Marine Survey Officer/Fresh Water Biologist.

But, for that, he should have minimum five years' research experience in

any of the institutions of the Fisheries Department. Further, there is a

ratio of 2:1 between Technical Assistants and Research Assistants

for promotion to the post of Research Officer. The petitioner, claiming

promotion to the post of Superintendent or Research Officer preferred

Ext.P4 representation.    The said representation was considered and

rejected by the Director of Fisheries by Ext.P5. In Ext.P5, it was stated

that his turn as per the seniority has not reached for promotion to those

posts. Challenging     Ext.P5 and seeking consequential reliefs the

Writ Petition was filed.   The respondents filed a counter affidavit. In

the said affidavit, an additional ground was taken to support denial

of promotion to him, that was, he did not have the requisite research

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">W.A.No.2315/2004                    2</span>


experience of five years prescribed for promotion to the post of

Research Officer. The respondents admitted that research institutions

under the Fisheries Department were transferred to the Kerala

Agricultural University in 1979. Only some applied research is being

now conducted in the Department. Research Assistants working in

that field are treated as having research experience for the purpose of

promotion to the post of Research Officer, it was submitted.       The

learned Single Judge, after hearing both sides, upheld the contention

of the respondents that the appellant/writ petitioner did not have the

requisite research experience and therefore, he cannot be promoted as

Research Officer. Challenging the said decision of the learned Single

Judge, the present Writ Appeal is filed.
</p>
<p id="p_3">            2. We heard the learned counsel on both sides.         The

learned counsel for the appellant submitted that since there is no

research in the Department now, the provision for five years' research

experience for promotion to the post of Research Officer is redundant

and unworkable. Further, he has worked for six years from 1989 to

1995 in the Shrimp Hatchery under the Fisheries Department and

therefore, he should be taken as one having the necessary research

experience. So, the decision of the learned Single Judge may be set

aside, it was prayed.
</p>
<p id="p_4"><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">W.A.No.2315/2004                     3</span>


</p><p id="p_5">             3. We heard the learned Government Pleader for the

respondents. He took us through the provisions in the Special Rules

and brought to our notice that the appellant can get promotion as

Superintendent without research experience.         If he wants to get

promotion as Research Officer, he has to wait according to his turn and

also should acquire research experience in the applied research field

under the Department. But, a Technical Assistant is not working in

that field of research and therefore, he is unqualified for promotion as

Research Officer, it is submitted.
</p>
<p id="p_6">             We find nothing wrong with Ext.P5. It only states that the

petitioner has to wait for his turn, according to the ratio for promotion

as Research Officer. But, in the counter affidavit, it was pointed out

that the petitioner did not have the necessary research experience

and only those who are working in applied research field under the

Fisheries Department will be held as having research experience. The

learned Single Judge, as mentioned earlier, accepted the said

contention and dismissed the Writ Petition. We find that the above

stand taken by the respondents or its affirmation by the learned Single

Judge cannot be said to be unreasonable or unjustified. So long as the

Special Rules are there, the petitioner can aspire for promotion as

Research Officer, if only he has research experience. Since he does

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">W.A.No.2315/2004                 4</span>


not   have research experience, his claim was rightly repelled.    He

cannot be treated on par with persons working in the applied research

field as Research Assistants. We are told that the appellant was later

promoted as Superintendent and still later as Assistant Director of

Fisheries. For the reasons mentioned above, we see no ground to

interfere with the judgment under appeal.       Accordingly, the Writ

Appeal is dismissed.
