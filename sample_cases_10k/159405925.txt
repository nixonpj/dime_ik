     HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE KANWALJIT SINGH AHLUWALIA

                                     Order

07/03/2019

       I have heard learned counsel for the petitioners and the

learned Public Prosecutor and gone through the contents of the

FIR.
</p>
<p id="p_2">       Specific   allegations   of    mal-treatment,    harassment   and

cruelty have been leveled against petitioners No.1 to 3, who are

father-in-law, husband and mother-in-law respectively of the

complainant-respondent No.2.
</p><p id="p_3">                                (2 of 3)               [CRLMP-1588/2019]



     Consequently, present petition is dismissed qua petitioners

No.1 to 3.
</p>
<p id="p_4">     However, considering the age and relationship of petitioners

No.1 and 3, who are father-in-law and mother-in-law respectively

of the complainant, their personal appearance before the court

below is exempted subject to following conditions:-

</p><p id="p_5">     (a) That the petitioners No.1 and 3 shall file an undertaking

before the trial court that they shall appear before the trial court

at the time of framing of charges, recording of statement of the

accused under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_1">Section 313</a> Cr.P.C. and at the time of delivery of

the judgment.
</p>
<p id="p_6">     (b) That in the undertaking to be filed, the petitioners No.1

and 3 shall specifically state that any evidence recorded in their

absence, but in presence of their counsel, shall be binding upon

them.
</p>
<p id="p_7">     (c) That the accused-petitioners No.1 and 3 shall also

undertake to appear before the trial court as and when called by

the trial Judge.
</p>
<p id="p_8">     (d) That upon appearance of the petitioners No.1 and 3

before the trial court, the trial court shall accept personal bail

bonds of petitioners No.1 and 3 along with bonds to be furnished

by the sureties towards regular bail and same shall enure during

the pendency of the trial.
</p>
<p id="p_9">     Petitioner No.4 is stated to be younger brother of husband of

complainant (Devar).
</p>
<p id="p_10">     Learned counsel for the petitioners has relied upon <a href="/doc/46704/" id="a_2">Preeti

Gupta v. State of Jharkhand &amp; Anr</a>., AIR 2010 (SC) 3363, to

contend that provisions of matrimonial offences have been

misused and unnecessarily petitioner No.4 has been dragged into
                                                                      (3 of 3)          [CRLMP-1588/2019]



                                   litigation. Learned counsel contends that the complainant has

                                   widened the net too far and petitioner No.4 has nothing to gain

                                   from the alleged demand of dowry.
</p>
<p id="p_11">                                             Issue notice to respondents qua petitioner No.4 only, for

                                   03.05.2019. Till then, further proceedings arising out of impugned

                                   FIR qua petitioner No.4 shall remain stayed.
