             WRIT PETITION NO.6440/2011


                        Jitu Prasad

                            Vs
              Industrial Development Bank
                         and another.


PRESENT : Hon'ble Shri Justice K.K. Trivedi. J.



     Shri Akash Choudhary, learned counsel for the
     Petitioner .
     Shri Anoop Nair, learned counsel for respondents.




                         ORDER
</pre><p id="p_1">                        (6.12.2012)



     This writ petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1">Article 226</a> of the Constitution
of India is directed against the order dated 22.2.2011, said
to be issued by the respondents, by which the services of
the petitioner have been terminated with immediate effect.
It is alleged that the petitioner took part in selection for
appointment on the post of Assistant Manager (Executive-
Grade-A) and on selection an offer of appointment was
issued to him.      The petitioner reported on duty on
1.12.2010. The relevant documents were produced by him.
However, after scrutiny of his documents, it was observed by
the Bank that the petitioner belongs to "Roniyar" (Baniya)
caste from the State of Jharkhand.    Finding that the said
caste was not appearing in the Central list of Other
Backward Class for the State of Jharkhand, as per the
Notification issued by the Government of India, Ministry of
Social Justice and Empowerment, it was treated that the
petitioner is not belonging to said OBC category and,
therefore, could not have been appointed under the said
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                2</span>

category. The order of termination was, thus, issued.      It is
contended that in the State of Bihar, before re-organisation
of the State, "Roniyar" (Baniya) was enlisted as a caste in
the OBC category. The process of recruitment was started
and at the time when the application was so submitted by
the petitioner, the said caste was included in the list of
OBC. However, because of the formation of the new State
of Jharkhand, the area in which the petitioner was living
falls within the State of Jharkhand, where the said caste
was not included as OBC in the list so issued, but
subsequently a modification was done and this particular
caste was again included in the list of the State of
Jharkhand. It is contended that under the provisions of the
Bihar Re-organisation Act, 2000 (hereinafter referred to as
the Act for brevity), such benefits are protected under the
circumstances and, as such, the petitioner would be one
who belongs to the OBC category in particular State and
would entitle to the benefit of appointment. It is contended
that the cancellation of appointment of the petitioner on
this count is not justified and, as such, the order impugned
is bad in law and is liable to be quashed.
</p>

<p id="p_2">2:    A return has been filed by the respondents raising the
preliminary objection with respect to the maintainability of
the writ petition on the ground that the respondent Bank is
not a State within the meaning of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_2">Article 12</a> of the
Constitution of India and no writ petition would be
maintainable against the said Bank.     It is contended that
the   petitioner   has   no   fundamental    right   to   claim
appointment or reinstatement in the services. There were
conditions mentioned in the offer of appointment extended
to the petitioner by the Bank wherein it was specifically
provided that in case it is found that the caste certificate
produced by the petitioner was invalid or not acceptable,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                               3</span>

his services would be terminated. It is contended that in
terms of the scrutiny when the fact was found that the
caste to which the petitioner belongs is not included as
OBC in the State of Jharkhand, rightly the appointment of
the petitioner was cancelled. It is contended that no wrong
is committed by the respondents and, as such, the order
impugned is just and proper.
</p>

<p id="p_3">3:     A rejoinder has been filed by the petitioner along with
which articles of association of the Bank have been
produced.     It has been pointed out by referring certain
classes of Article of Association that respondent is a
Company registered under the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_3">Companies Act</a>, but is
discharging the banking functions as have been delegated
by the Reserved Bank of India and, as such, is discharging
the public duties.    Thus, it is contended that the Bank is a
Company of the State function and is covered as an
authority   within   the   meaning    of   <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_4">Article   12</a>   of   the
Constitution of India.     Thus, it is contended that the writ
petition is maintainable. As far as the applicability of the
provisions of the Act, it is contended that the benefit is still
available to the petitioner under the provisions of the said
Act.
</p>

<p id="p_4">4:     Heard learned counsel for the parties at length and
perused the record.
</p><p id="p_5">5:     As far as the first objection of the respondents is
concerned, the same is liable to be rejected outrightly. The
Board of Director of the Bank is constituted in the manner
prescribed in the Article of Association wherein it is
provided that 51% members of the Board of Director would
be the Central Government officials. It is provided that the
Reserved Bank of India may have the power to remove the
Chairman or whole time Director of the Bank.          In Clause
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                  4</span>

122 of the Article of Association, it is provided that election
of the Director is to be made for a period of three years and
the control over the Bank is to be supervised by the
Reserved Bank of India. The respondent Bank is not only
recognised as other public sector Bank by the Reserved
Bank of India, but its Board of Director is constituted by
taking the Government officials in its folds.      The Bank is
required to discharge many functions which are entrusted
to the Nationalised Bank. Thus, since the respondent Bank
is discharging the public function as well though it is a
Commercial Bank, the same is an authority within the
meaning of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_5">Article 12</a> of the Constitution of India. No much
debate is necessary in this respect.
</p>

<p id="p_6">6:    As far as the other objection is raised, the provisions
of <a href="/doc/799302/" id="a_6">Section 84</a> of the Act would make it clear that the
provisions of Part-II of the Act are not deemed to have
effected any change in the territories to which any law in
force immediately before the appointed day extends or
applies. Yet another power is there to make the adaption
of laws as prescribed under <a href="/doc/1506895/" id="a_7">Section 85</a> of the Act.             The
provisions of <a href="/doc/799302/" id="a_8">Section 84</a> and <a href="/doc/1506895/" id="a_9">85</a> of the Act are reproduced
for ready reference :-
</p><p id="p_7">          "84. Territorial extent of laws.-        The
     provisions of Part-II of this Act shall not be deemed
     to have effected any change in the territories to
     which any law in force immediately before the
     appointed day extends or applies, and territorial
     references in any such law to the State of Bihar
     shall, until otherwise provided by a competent
     Legislature   or    other   competent   authority   be
     construed as meaning the territories within the
     existing State of Bihar before the appointed day.
</p><p id="p_8">          85. Power to adapt laws.-          For         the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                               5</span>

     purpose of facilitating the application in relation to
     the State of Bihar or Jharkhand of any law made
     before    the   appointed     day,     the   appropriate
     Government may, before the expiration of two
     years    from   that   day,   by    order,   make   such
     adaptations and modifications of the law, whether
     by way of repeal or amendment, as may be
     necessary or expedient, and thereupon every such
     law shall have effect subject to the adaptions and
     modifications so made until altered, repealed or
     amended by a competent Legislature or other
     competent authority.
</p><p id="p_9">          Explanation.- In this section the expression
     "appropriate Government" means as respects any
     law relating to a matter enunciated in the Union
     List, the Central Government, and as respects any
     other law in its application to a State, the State
     Government."
</p>

<p id="p_10">7:    By virtue of such adaption, the State list which was in
existence and on the basis of which the certificate was
issued to the petitioner with respect to his caste category
certifying that he belongs to OBC caste cannot be said to
be invalid or illegal. It is not in dispute that subsequently
for the State of Jharkhand also         "Roniyar" (Baniya) caste
was specifically added as OBC category.            Thus, merely
because of such a fact that for certain period, the list was
not revalidated, it cannot be said that the petitioner is not
belonging to a particular caste, and that he will not get the
benefit of reservation made for the said caste. The order
impugned, therefore, does not hold good. The respondents
have not verified the said certificate at the time when the
selection process was going on.           Had it been done, the
petitioner would have been informed about such a fact. As
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                   6</span>

far as the selection part is concerned, it is not in dispute
that    the   petitioner    has   qualified    the   selection   test
successfully. The law is well settled in this respect as well
that the process of recruitment if started, the same would
be conducted and completed under the existing Rules
which were in vogue when the process of selection was
started.      This being so, it cannot be said that the
appointment of petitioner was fraudulent or bad in law in
any manner. The cancellation of such an appointment was
not permissible.
</p>

<p id="p_11">8:     The issue whether a particular person belongs to a
particular category or not was dealt with by the Apex Court
in     the    case     of   Mathuri    Patil     Vs.    Additional
Commissioner, Tribal Development and others (AIR
1994 SC 94). The Apex Court has held that validity of a
caste certificate has to be examined by a High Power
Screening Committee. It is not a case that an enquiry was
got conducted with respect to the validity of the caste
certificate of the petitioner from a High Power Screening
Committee and then only the action was taken by the
respondents      for    termination   of   the   services   of   the
petitioner.     If in the opinion of the respondents, the
petitioner was not belonging to the particular caste or that
particular caste was not included in the list of OBC category
in the State of Jharkhand even then a certificate was issued
to him, it was necessary to get such a fact enquired by the
High Power Screening Committee.               The caste certificate
issued in favour of the petitioner by the competent
authority was not cancelled at any time.             That being so,
merely because description of the caste for the time being
was not in the list, termination of services of the petitioner
was not justified.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                7</span>

<p id="p_12">9:        In view of the aforesaid enunciation of law by the
Apex Court, the action of the respondents in terminating
the       services of the petitioner cannot be sustained.   The
order impugned is, thus, liable to be quashed.
</p>

<p id="p_13">10 : Consequently, the writ petition is allowed. The order
dated 22.2.2011 (Annx.P/1) is, hereby, quashed.             The
respondents are directed to reinstate the petitioner in
service forthwith, with all the consequential benefits.
</p>

<p id="p_14">11 : The writ petition is allowed to the extent indicated
herein above. There shall be no order as to costs.
