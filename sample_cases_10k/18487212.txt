     HON'BLE DR. JUSTICE PUSHPENDRA SINGH BHATI
                           Judgment / Order
29/11/2017

</p><p id="p_8">1.           The grievance of the petitioners is that he could not

appear on stipulated date for document verification for the post of

Teacher Grade-III.
</p>
<p id="p_9">2.           This Court had already dealt with the issue and had

passed the following order on 27.11.2017:

<blockquote id="blockquote_1">     "1.            The grievance of the petitioners is that they
     could    not    appear   on   stipulated   date   for   document
     verification for the post of Teacher Grade-III.

                                                           [CW-12023/2017]

Civil Writ Petition No.18992/2017 (Brijesh Kumari
Vs. State of Rajasthan &amp; Ors.) and other connected writ
petitions, decided on 08.11.2017 have disposed of the writ
petitions by giving directions to the concerned Zila Parishad
that they should provide one more opportunity to the
petitioners in those writ petitions for their document
verification.
</p>
<p id="p_11">3.          This Hon'ble Court while passing the aforesaid
order had fixed the date of document verification to be of
16.11.2017 and 17.11.2017.
</p>
<p id="p_12">4.          Since the matter pertains to Jaipur Bench of
this Hon'ble Court and all the petitions pending before
Principal   Seat   of   this   Hon'ble    Court   were   decided,
therefore, it would not be suffice to follow the same dates
i.e. 16.11.2017 &amp; 17.11.2017 for re-verification.
</p>
<p id="p_13">5.          In the case of Brijesh Kumari Vs. State of
Rajasthan &amp; Ors. (supra), this Hon'ble Court has passed
the following order:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">           "Since, the present batch of writ petitions
      has been filed by the petitioners with a
      common grievance, therefore, the same has
      been taken up together and decided by this
      common order.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">            The petitioners are the candidates, who
      have participated in the selection process for
      the post of Teacher Grade-III. The recruitment
      process was initiated by issuing advertisement
      in 2013 by the different Zila Parishad for
      making the appointment on the aforesaid post.
      The result of the said examination was declared
      in August, 2017 and the cutoff marks were also
      issued by calling the candidates 1.5 times in
      proportion to the vacancies advertised.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">             The required candidates when failed to
      join the Department, the respondents issued
      the second list in October, 2017 and again
      issued the cutoff marks of the second list and
      notified    the   candidates   for   document
      verification in the same ratio of 1.5 times
      against the vacancies, which were available.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_6">             The    present   petitioners  are   the
      candidates, who could not attend the office of
      Zila    Parishad   concerned,    for document
      verification on the dates given by the Zila
                       (3 of 6)
                                                    [CW-12023/2017]

Parishad concerned.</blockquote>
<p id="p_14">       Grievance raised by the petitioners in the
present writ petitions is about the document
verification carried out only by issuing
advertisement in the newspaper and not by
personal information sent to them. The
petitioners have pleaded that the respondents
ought to have sent personal information to the
petitioners for document verification. The
petitioners have enumerated their various
difficulties in not appearing on the stipulated
date for document verification.
</p><p id="p_15">      The petitioners have also taken a plea
that the advertisement was issued in the year
2013 and due to various litigations, the
document verification was scheduled after a
gap of about 4 years, that too, after revision of
result.
</p><p id="p_16">      Learned counsel for the petitioner has
further submitted that Clause No. 16 of the
advertisement issued for making recruitment
process clearly shows the manner of submitting
the online applications by the incumbents.
</p><p id="p_17">      Counsel submits that recruiting agency
had clearly given out the instructions to the
effect that the candidates will be informed
about their roll number and Examination
Center on their E-mail ID/Mobile Number.
Counsel submits that if the Department was
obliged to inform the candidates about their roll
number and Examination Center, the non-
communication of personal intimation about
document verification is much more fatal for
the candidates, counsel has submitted that
inclusion of petitioners names in the merit list
for consideration for appointment results into a
crystallized right and as such, at this juncture,
there is more responsibility on the part of
Recruiting Agency to send the intimation to the
candidates by personal mode.
</p><p id="p_18">      Mr. S.K. Gupta, AAG, has appeared on
behalf of the respondents and opposed the
aforesaid prayer of the petitioners. Counsel for
the respondents contended that the requisite
intimation was published in the newspaper by
the Zila Parishad concerned and also uploaded
on the web-site of the Department. Mr. S.K.
Gupta AAG also submits that there was no
requirement of sending the intimation to the
candidates by any other mode and in
                      (4 of 6)
                                                    [CW-12023/2017]

particularly the personal service. Mr. S.K.
Gupta, AAG, submits that appointments were
made in the year 2015 itself, but due to
controversy raised about minimum marks
obtained in RTET, the matter travelled to the
Supreme Court and as such, the Department
was to make appointments after the judgment
of the Apex Court.
</p><p id="p_19">      Counsel for the respondent has further
submitted that initially the appointments were
given only to those candidates, who have
obtained minimum 60% marks in RTET and all
other candidates were not eligible.
</p><p id="p_20">      Counsel   for   the   respondent    also
submitted that the candidates who had applied
in pursuance of the advertisement issued in
2013, should have been vigilant and they were
required to keep track of the advertisements
and once the intimation was uploaded on the
web-site, no other mode of service is
contemplated either in the Rules or in the
instructions.
</p><p id="p_21">      Mr. S.K. Gupta, AAG, has drawn attention
of the Court towards Sub-Instruction No. (9) of
the Instructions No. 19 wherein general
instructions were given. Counsel for the
respondents submits that all the candidates
were informed that all information relating to
the Examination was available on the web-site
i.e. www.examtgt.rajasthan.gov.in.
</p><p id="p_22">     I have considered the rival submissions
made by both the parties and perused the
material available on record.
</p><p id="p_23">     It is not disputed that the selection
process for the post of Teacher Grade-III was
conducted and set in motion in 2013 and due
to various round of litigations, finally the
second list of selected candidates with cutoff
marks was issued in August, 2017.
</p><p id="p_24">      The appointments, which were made in
the year 2015, were only on the basis of marks
obtained by the candidates, when minimum
qualifying marks are 60% in RTET.
</p><p id="p_25">      All the petitioners in the instant batch of
writ petitions, are the candidates who are
claiming to be in the select list as per the
second revised list, which has been issued in
October, 2017 and they have to appear for
document verification before the Zila Parishad
                       (5 of 6)
                                                     [CW-12023/2017]

concerned.
</p><p id="p_26">      The Court finds that there were
reasonable grounds in some of the cases,
which were beyond control of the candidates,
which prevented them from appearing on the
stipulated date before the Zila Parishad
concerned. Learned counsel for the parties
have pointed out that in some of the cases, the
person concerned was not keeping well, the
lady delivered the child and there were many
other compelling circumstances.
</p><p id="p_27">       The Court finds that since all the
petitioners are claiming themselves in the
selected list and they were having more marks
than the last cutoff marks declared in their
respective category in the revised result, they
deserve indulgence and the Court deems it
proper to grant them one more opportunity to
produce their documents for verification before
the Zila Parishad concerned.
</p><p id="p_28">      Though, the Selection Process is already
delayed, yet considering the fact that the
Department itself has issued the notice to the
different candidates and also uploaded on the
web-site, no harm would be caused to the
Department, if in the interest of justice, one
more opportunity is granted to these
candidates.
</p><p id="p_29">       The Court without expressing any opinion
about the rival submissions of the parties about
requirement of sending the personal intimation
to the candidates, suffice it to say that
candidates are also required to remain vigilant
about the entire recruitment process and
official web-site is always available to them to
see the developments which take place from
time to time.
</p><p id="p_30">      In view of the above, the present batch of
writ petitions are disposed of with a direction to
the respondents and Zila Parishad concerned
that they should give one more opportunity to
the petitioners to come forward for their
document verification. It is made clear that
said direction is only with regard to the
document verification of the petitioners who
were prevented from appearing on the early
dates given by the Zila Parishad concerned.
</p><p id="p_31">       It is also made clear that mere
verification of document will not confer any
                                   (6 of 6)
                                                                 [CW-12023/2017]

             right in favour of the petitioners to claim
             appointment, however, if the petitioners are
             finding their name/place in the merit or they
             are otherwise found suitable, their case will
             accordingly be considered for appointment in
             accordance with law. It is further directed that
             the petitioners will appear before the Zila
             Parishad concerned either on 16th or 17th
             November, 2017 for document verification and
             the Zila Parishad concerned will verify their
             documents, when they appear either of the
             date i.e. 16th or 17th November, 2017.
</p><p id="p_32">                   Accordingly all the writ petitions are
             disposed of. Stay applications also stand
             closed."
</p>
<p id="p_33">        6.         The present writ petitions are also disposed of
        in the same terms as passed in S.B. Civil Writ Petition
        No.18821/2017        (Brijesh        Kumari   Vs.   State    of
        Rajasthan &amp; Ors.) on 08.11.2017. However, the date
        of document verification i.e. 16.11.2017 &amp; 17.11.2017
        for directing the petitioners for appearing before Zila
        Parishad     concerned   for   document       verification   are
        substituted by the dates i.e. 11.12.2017 &amp; 12.12.2017
        in the aforementioned judgment to be followed by the
        respondents."
</p>
<p id="p_34">3.           Earlier the petitioner was protected by an interim order

passed by this Court which entitled them for verification and

consequential benefits.
</p>
<p id="p_35">4.           In light of the aforesaid final order and interim order,

the present writ petition is disposed with the direction to the

respondents to give appointment to the petitioners in case he is

falling in merit and he has no other disqualification except for the

verification part of it which as per the statement of learned

counsel for the petitioners has been undergone.
