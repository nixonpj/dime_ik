                         JUDGMENT
</pre>

<p id="p_1">      The   present   appeal    has   been   preferred   by   the

appellants-claimants challenging the judgment and award

dated 26.12.2016, passed by the XI Addl. District and

Sessions Judge and Addl. MACT, Belagavi in MVC No.

343/2016.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">      2.    Heard. Though the case is listed for orders, with

the consent of learned counsel appearing for the parties, it is

taken up for final disposal.
</p>
<p id="p_4">
</p><p id="p_5">      3.    The brief facts leading to the case are that, on

14.12.2015, at about 5.00 P.M. Sri. Arvind S/o. Narayan

Apte was proceeding on motorcycle bearing No.KA-22/ES-

2663, when he came near Mutaga Petrol Pump, on Belagavi-

Bagalkot road, at that time the driver of Maruti Swift Dzire

car No.KA-29/N-0497 came from Belagavi towards Bagalkot

rashly and negligently and dashed to the motorcycle on

which the said Arvind was proceeding.        As a result of the

same, he sustained grievous injuries and died during the

course of the treatment.       It is further contention of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                               4</span>




petitioners that the said deceased Aravind was serving as

Store Keeper at construction site of Sambra Airport under

the employment of Harsha Construction Company Private

Limited and drawing a salary of Rs.22,000/- per month. For

having lost the bread earner, wife and sons filed a claim

petition under <a href="/doc/136948773/" id="a_1">Section 166</a> of M.V. Act.
</p>
<p id="p_6">
</p><p id="p_7">      4.    In pursuance of the notice, the respondents

have appeared and respondent No.1 filed his objections by

denying the contents of the petition, he further contended

that the respondent No.2 is the Insurer of the said vehicle

and policy was in force as on the date of accident.    The

respondent No.2 is liable to pay the compensation.


</p><p id="p_8">      5.    The respondent No.2 filed his objections by

denying the contents of the petition, he further contended

that the respondent No.2 has not issued the policy and

accident has occurred due to the fault of deceased himself.

He further contended that the petition is not maintainable

and the same is liable to be dismissed.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                 5</span><p id="p_9">




</p><p id="p_10">      6.    On the basis of above pleadings, the Tribunal

framed the following issues :
</p>
<p id="p_11">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">       1.   Whether the petitioners prove that on
            14.12.2015 at about 5.00 p.m. on near Mutaga
            Petrol Pump, on Belagavi-Bagalkot road, one Sri.
            Arvind S/o. Narayan Apte died in the accident
            occurred due to rash or negligent driving of the
            vehicle, bearing Regn. No.KA-29/N-0497 by its
            driver ?
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">       2.   Whether the petitioners were the dependants of
            the deceased Sri. Arvind S/o. Narayan Apte?
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">       3.   Whether the petitioners are entitled for
            compensation ? if so, to what amount and from
            whom ?
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">       4.   What order or award ?</blockquote><p id="p_12">



</p><p id="p_13">      7.    In order to prove the case of the petitioners, the

petitioner No.1 got examined herself as PW1 and got marked

the documents as Ex.P1 to P8.            On behalf of the

respondents,   the respondent No.1 examined the driver as

RW1 and got marked Ex.R1. The respondent No.2 examined

its Executive as RW2 and got marked the documents as

Ex.R2 and R3.     After hearing the parties to the lis, the

impugned judgment and award came to be passed. Assailing

the same, the appellants-claimants are before this Court.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                 6</span>




</p><p id="p_14">      8.    The main grounds urged by the learned counsel

for the appellants are that though the deceased was serving

as Store keeper at Construction site of Sambra Airport under

the employment of Harsha Construction Company Private

Limited and was drawing salary of Rs.22,000/- per month,

the Tribunal has not taken into consideration the said aspect

and by taking the notional income of Rs.9,000/- and without

applying future prospectus, has awarded the compensation

on the lower side.          She further contended that the

compensation awarded is on the lower side and the same

requires to be enhanced. She prayed for allowing the appeal

by enhancing the compensation.
</p>
<p id="p_15">
</p><p id="p_16">      9.    Per   contra,    the    learned   counsel   for   the

respondent-Insurer vehemently argued by contending that

though the petitioners have contended that the deceased was

working as store keeper under the employment of Harsha

Construction Company Private Limited, but they have not

examined any of the person as per Ex.P8 and only on the

basis of Ex.P8, it cannot be held that he was working on

permanent basis under the said Contractor. Under the said
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                 7</span>




facts and circumstances, the Tribunal has rightly come to

the conclusion and has awarded the just compensation.      He

further contented that the compensation awarded under the

conventional head is on the higher side and the same

requires to be reduced.      On these grounds, he prayed for

dismissal of the appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_17">
</p><p id="p_18">      10.   The accident in question, is not in dispute, so

also involvement of the offending vehicle insured with

respondent-Insurer.
</p>
<p id="p_19">
</p><p id="p_20">      11.   As could be seen from the judgment and award,

it is the contention of the petitioners that the deceased was

serving as store keeper and working under the employment

of Harsha Constructions        Company Private Ltd.,      and

drawing a salary of Rs.22,000/- per month and they have

also produced the salary certificate as per Ex.P8. In order to

substantiate the said fact, no other persons have been

examined    belonging   to   Harsha   Construction   Company

Private Ltd., Under the said facts and circumstances, the

Tribunal by taking the notional income at Rs.9,000/- per

month and after deducting 1/3rd towards personal expenses
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                       8</span>




of the deceased and after applying multiplier of '9' has

awarded the compensation of Rs.6,48,000/- towards loss of

dependency and under the conventional head the Tribunal

has awarded an amount of Rs.3,25,000/-. Though under the

normal circumstances, the contention taken up by the

learned counsel for the appellants appears to be justifiable.

In   order   to   grant future        prospectus,     the   petitioners-

claimants have to establish a fixed avocation or a fixed

income, if he is self employed or he must have a fixed salary,

then only future prospectus can be considered.                    In the

instant case on hand, no such documents have been

produced,    even       no   employer       has   been     examined   to

substantiate      the   fact   that       the   deceased    was   having

permanent job in the company.               Under the said facts and

circumstances, in view of the decision of Hon'ble Apex Court

in the case of     <a href="/doc/139996215/" id="a_2">National Insurance Company Limited v.

Pranay Sethi and others</a> reported in AIR 2017 SC 5157,

the said contention cannot be acceptable in law.


</p><p id="p_21">      12.    By going through the material on record and on

perusal of the judgment and award, the compensation
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                 9</span>




awarded is just and proper, it does not require any

interference for enhancement.
</p>
<p id="p_22">
</p><p id="p_23">        The learned counsel for respondent-Insurer submitted

that already the full award amount has been deposited.

Under the facts and circumstances, the appeal is dismissed

as devoid of merits.
