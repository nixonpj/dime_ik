<p id="p_1">                                 This revision petition, invoking supervisory jurisdiction of this
                     Court under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_1">Article 227</a> of the Constitution of India, is directed against order
                     dated 17.11.2014 (Annexure P-2) passed by the Executing Court in
                     execution of the decree dated 22.10.2008 (Annexure P-1) whereby the
                     judgment-debtor (for short, the JD), petitioner herein, has been sent to civil
                     imprisonment for non-payment of the decreetal amount.
</p>

<p id="p_2">                     2.          It is claimed that simple default is not enough and there must be
                     some element of bad faith beyond mere indifference of the JD to pay the
                     decreetal amount. Support has been sought from Jolly George Verghese and
                     another Versus The Bank of Cochin 1980(2) Supreme Court Reports 913.
                     In the cited authority, the decree-holder/bank in execution of the decree had

                     terms of Section 51 and Order XXI Rule 37 CPC. It was found by the
                     Hon'ble Apex Court that even on an earlier occasion, there had been a
                     similar warrant of arrest in execution of the same decree and the
                     decree-holder had already proceeded against the properties of the JDs and in
                     consequence thereof, all immovable properties of the JDs had been attached
                     for the purpose of sale in discharge of the decree. Even a Receiver had been
                     appointed by the Executing Court to manage the properties under
                     attachment. Despite this, the court had issued a warrant of arrest against the
                     JDs. It was in these circumstances that the Hon'ble Apex Court had
                     intervened and had observed that a simple default to discharge the debts is
                     not enough. In the present case, circumstances are entirely different.
</p>

<p id="p_3">                     3.           Decree is dated 22.10.2008 and in pursuance to conditional
                     warrant of arrest, during execution proceedings of the said decree, the JD
                     had appeared and had made a statement on 23.3.2014 seeking time to make
                     the payment to the decree-holder in the court itself. He was given time and
                     the matter was adjourned for making payment by the JD. The JD did not
                     honour his commitment resulting in issuance of fresh conditional warrant of
                     arrest against him. This time, plea taken by him was that he had no
                     immovable and movable property to pay. Even today, it is claimed that he is
                     not in a position to pay the entire amount straightway.
</p>

<p id="p_4">                     4.           If an application for payment of the decreetal amount in
                     installments is made by the JD, petitioner herein, before the Executing
                     Court, the same would be considered on the same day so that agony of the
                     petitioner-JD is not prolonged even for another day.
</p>
<p id="p_5">                     5.           Liberty is granted to the petitioner-JD to make an application
                     before the Executing Court which would be decided by the said court, as
                     already mentioned on the same day, without being influenced by impugned
