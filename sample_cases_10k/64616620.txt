                                                  [ CWP No. 6735/2017]

                   JUSTICE DINESH MEHTA
                           Judgment

05/07/2017
     Heard learned counsels for the parties and perused the

material available on record.

     The facts in short are that the respondent-Zila Parishad

issued the advertisement dated 24.02.2012 for recruitment to

the post of Teacher Grade III-2012. The selections made in

pursuance to the said advertisement were challenged before this

Court. Subsequently, the Division Bench of this Court vide

judgment   and   order   dated    08.12.2014   passed     in   Manju

Choudhary &amp; ors. Vs. State of Rajasthan &amp; ors. (DB Civil Special

Appeal (Writ) No.35/2014)), while partly allowing the Special

Appeals passed the following directions:-


     "We do not find any error of law and agree with the
     reasoning given by learned Single Judge in Ramdhan
     Kumawat V/s The State of Rajasthan &amp; anr. (supra),
     pursuant to which the results have to be 14 revised
     after fresh evaluation of answers. The revision of
     select list is thus not complete and the process is still
     open. In the circumstances, in order to allay any
                             3/7
                                              [ CWP No. 6735/2017]

apprehension and to protect the interest of the
appellants-petitioners, who were appointed, and are
under constant threat on the revision of lists under
directions of the Court, without any fault attributed to
them, we find it appropriate to quash the order dated
30.8.2013     passed     by       the   Secretary     and
Commissioner, Gramin Vikas and Panchayati Raj
Department    (Panchayati     Raj   Primary   Education),
Government of Rajasthan, Jaipur, to the extent that it
directs termination of services of those persons, who
were ousted from selections on the declaration of the
first revised results. We direct that at this stage, they
will not be ousted from service. The termination
orders passed, if any, consequent to the orders dated
30.8.2013, are set aside. The directions given by
learned Single Judge in Ramdhan Kumawat V/s The
State of Rajasthan &amp; anr. (supra), namely, that the
Expert Committee will issue model answer keys afresh
and that the results will be revised in accordance with
such keys, will be given effect to, leaving the question
of its correctness open. The State Government will be
at liberty to pass fresh orders, after revising the
results and adjusting equities protecting the interest
of the appellants-petitioners, to the extent that they
will not be ousted from the select list and will be
                                 4/7
                                                   [ CWP No. 6735/2017]

     placed as far as possible at the bottom of the revised
     select list."


     As a result, all those candidates whose names appeared in

the revised list were granted appointment and those who had

already stood selected, continued to remain in service in spite of

the fact that their names no more figured in the revised list. The

outfall is that there were many candidates whose names were

not in merit in the first list but as per the revised result got more

marks than those who were allowed to continue in service by the

order of the High Court even though, they now had less marks

than the petitioners. The Special Leave Petition against the

judgment and order dated 08.12.2014 was also dismissed. Thus,

as on date, all those candidates who had got less marks than the

petitioners are continuing to be retained in service and the same

has resulted in filing of number of writ petitions by candidates

who now have more marks as per the revised result. Thus, the

grievance of the petitioners is that in pursuance to the same

selection, the candidates less meritorious to the petitioners are

continuing in service, whereas, as per the revised result, the
                                 5/7
                                                   [ CWP No. 6735/2017]

petitioners have got more marks than those who are retained in

service by the order of the Court. In short, those who had got

less marks than the petitioners are still continuing in service.

     The matter having been settled uptill Hon'ble Supreme

Court, the candidates who were appointed in pursuance to the

first list shall have to be permitted to continue. The respondent-

State taking into account the grievance of the petitioners have

tried to workout the possibility to adjust as many as candidates

as possible from amongst those who have got more marks than

the last candidate selected to the extent of the vacancies still

available out of the advertised vacancies.

     Learned Additional Advocate General has filed the reply in

some of the petitions and has placed on record the order dated

08.02.2017 showing that the Department is trying to ascertain

the factual position of the vacancies in each of the Zila Parishads

and also taking into account the bifurcation of the vacancies as

per the reservations. It is stated that the detail of the vacancies

for some of the Zila Parishads have been received and from some

of the Zila Parishads, it is likely to be received in few days time
                                6/7
                                                  [ CWP No. 6735/2017]

and after the whole process is completed, they shall offer the

appointment after verification of their documents to the most

meritorious candidates from amongst those who have got more

marks than the last candidate still working with the department

in pursuance to the selection of the advertisement dated

24.02.2012.

     In view of the fair stand taken by the respondent State and

appreciating the exercise being undertaken by them to meet the

situation in hand, all the abovementioned writ petitions are

disposed of as under:-

a.   The respondent-State shall workout the vacancies in each of

     the Zila Parishads as expeditiously as possible. Thereafter,

     the list shall be prepared of the candidates who have got

     more marks than the last candidate still working with the

     department in pursuance to the directions of this Court

     passed in Manju Choudhary's case (supra).

b.   Thereafter, the candidates as per the ratio of 1:2 of the

     vacancies available shall be called for the verification of the

     documents and the appointments shall be given to such like
                                 7/7
                                                  [ CWP No. 6735/2017]

      eligible candidates as per their merit equivalent to the

      vacancies available with the department.

c.    This Court is aware that some of the candidates are bound

      to be left out even though they have got more marks than

      the last candidate but taking into account the limited

      number of vacancies, the said candidates shall have to try

      their luck in the next recruitment process afresh.

d.    The said process be completed as expeditiously as possible

      preferably within 06 months from today.



      The writ petition stands disposed of accordingly.
