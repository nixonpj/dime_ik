                 CORAM: HONOURABLE THE CHIEF JUSTICE
                                       ORAL ORDER

4   01-08-2018                  These matters are placed before the Court today in

                  the light of certain developments that have taken place after

                  orders were passed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court on
 Patna High Court REQ. CASE No.28 of 2017(4) dt.01-08-2018
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                            5/6</span>




         29.01.2018 in Special Leave to Appeal Case No. 450/2018.
</p>
<p id="p_54">                      These applications were seeking constitution of an

         Arbitral Tribunal in the matter of dispute that has arisen between

         the applicant and the Bihar State Food and Civil Supplies

         Corporation in the matter of supply of rice and other products.
</p>
<p id="p_55">                      After     hearing     detailed        argument   and   various

         objections, this Court appointed arbitrators in more than 200

         cases and the arbitrators were seized of the matter.                In the

         meanwhile, the Corporation approached the Hon'ble Supreme

         Court in Special Leave to Appeal No. 450/2018 and by a

         detailed order passed on 29.01.2018, even though Hon'ble

         Supreme Court upheld the order passed by this Court in the

         matter of constituting an Arbitral Tribunal and referring the

         matter for arbitration, but directed that not more than ten cases

         should be allotted to a single arbitrator. As a consequence of the

         aforesaid order passed, in cases where the arbitrators appointed

         by this Court on earlier occasions were allotted more than ten

         cases, they had returned the files to this Court after retaining ten

         cases for hearing of the matter. Considering the fact that there

         were not adequate number of arbitrators available for allotting

         ten cases as directed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court, this Court

         deemed it appropriate to direct the Registrar General of this
             Patna High Court REQ. CASE No.28 of 2017(4) dt.01-08-2018
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                                        6/6</span>




                     Court to examine the availability of arbitrators, which included

                     retired High Court Judges and retired Senior District Judges, so

                     that allotment of ten cases to each arbitrator can be made

                     keeping in view the quantification of the claim of each party.
</p>
<p id="p_56">                     Accordingly, the office of the Registrar General after conducting

                     a detailed exercise has submitted a list of cases to this Court

                     along with a list of arbitrators who can be appointed.
</p>
<p id="p_57">                                  If any file has not been returned or has been retained

                     by the earlier arbitrator, the Registrar General to obtain it and

                     refer it to the new arbitrator.
</p>
<p id="p_58">                                  Accordingly, these applications are allowed and now

                     Hon'ble Mr. Justice (Retd.) V.N. Sinha is appointed arbitrator to

                     adjudicate and deal with the issue in question.
</p>
<p id="p_59">                                  The Arbitrator, in pursuance to this order, shall

                     proceed in accordance with law.
