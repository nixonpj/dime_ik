<p id="p_1">1.		The
present Civil Application has been preferred by the applicants  
original plaintiffs seeking amendment of the claim in the Suit and
permit the applicants to enhance its claim from Rs.1,00,00,000/-
(Rupees one Crore only) to Rs.10,64,00,000/- (Rupees Ten Crores Sixty
Four Lacs only).
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_2">2.		It
is the case on behalf of the applicants- original plaintiffs that
initially the applicants   original plaintiffs had filed Civil Suit
No.1 of 2005 before the learned District Court, Valsad seeking
perpetual order of injunction restraining the opponents - original
defendants from in any manner manufacturing and/or offering for sale
the said product viz. Phosphorous Pentachloride, or applying the
invention covered by the said Patent No.172459 for manufacture of
Phosphorous Pentachloride. As the defendants have also tendered
counter claim for revocation of aforesaid Patent No.172459, the suit
has been transferred to this Court. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_3">3.		It
is the case on behalf of the applicants   original plaintiffs that
the Civil Suit in question has been filed claiming damages then
estimated at Rs.1 Crore and in the alternative, the applicants had
submitted that they are entitled to an order directing the defendants
to render a true and faithful account of all the profits earned by
the defendants by selling the said product and that the defendants be
further ordered and decreed to pay to the applicants such amount as
may be found due on such account being taken. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_4">4.		It
is submitted by learned advocate appearing on behalf of the
applicants   original plaintiffs that the loss suffered by the
plaintiffs is much more than what was initially perceived and the
amount of profit derived by the opponents- defendants from infringing
the applicants' Patent  No.172459, is far more too. Therefore, the
applicants   original plaintiffs have submitted the present
application seeking amendment of the claim in the Suit. It is the
avernment in the application that the applicants believe that
considering the sales made by the defendants, the defendants would
have at least made profit exceeding of Rs.10,64,00,000/- (Rupees Ten
Crores Sixty Four Lacs only) by infringing the Patent No.172459 of
the applicants and, therefore, it is requested to allow the present
application and permit the applicants to enhance its claim to
Rs.10,64,00,000/- (Rupees Ten Crores Sixty Four Lacs only). 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_5">5.		The
applicants   original plaintiffs have also requested to permit the
applicants- original plaintiffs to amend the plaint by replacing
Paragraph Nos.12, 16 and 21(b), as per Schedule   I. Substance of
the request of the applicants is to permit the applicants  
original plaintiffs to enhance the claim by way of damages to
Rs.10,64,00,000/- (Rupees Ten Crores Sixty Four Lacs only). 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_6">6.		Mr.Bijal
Chhatrapati, learned advocate appearing on behalf of the applicants  
original plaintiffs have vehemently submitted that as such according
to the defendants themselves, the sales of the infringing product  
Phosphorous Pentachloride made by the defendants for the period 2003
to 2010 is about 4257 metric tons and on conservative estimate, the
defendants had made profit of Rs.10,64,00,000/- (Rupees Ten Crores
Sixty Four Lacs only) of Phosphorous Pentachloride. It is further
submitted that as such the plaintiffs are using Nickel equipments,
whereas the defendants are using Lead equipments and, therefore, the
cost of production of the plaintiffs is much more than that of the
defendants. It is submitted that cost of production of the defendants
being low, the profits earned by the defendants are much more than
that of the plaintiffs. Therefore, it is requested to allow the
present application and permit the applicants   original plaintiffs
to enhance the claim by way of damages from Rs.1,00,00,000/- (Rupees
One Crore only) to Rs.10,64,00,000/- (Rupees Ten Crores Sixty Four
Lacs only). 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_7">7.		Mr.Bijal
Chhatrapati, learned advocate appearing on behalf of the applicants-
original plaintiffs has relied upon the following decisions of the
Hon'ble Supreme Court as well as Orissa High Court and Allahabad High
Court in support of his prayer that to permit the applicants to amend
the plaint and to enhance the claim by way of damages to
Rs.10,64,00,000/- (Rupees Ten Crores Sixty Four Lacs only):-

</p><p id="p_15">8.		The
present application is opposed by Mr.Manav Mehta, learned advocate
appearing on behalf of the opponents   original defendants. It is
submitted that by way of amendment, applicants   original
plaintiffs want to introduce new case or new cause of action.
Therefore, it is requested to dismiss the present application. It is
submitted that in the original suit- plaint, plaintiffs have never
claimed damages by way of loss of profit as now sough to be claimed
by way of amendment. It is submitted that in the original plaint and
at the time of filing of the suit in the year 2001, the plaintiffs
have claimed damages estimated to Rs.1 Crore by reason of the acts of
infringement committed by the defendants, the plaintiffs have
suffered damages. It is submitted that as stated hereinabove, the
plaintiffs have never prayed for damages due to loss of profit to the
plaintiffs. Therefore, it is submitted that by such an amendment and
under the guise of enhancement of the claim, the plaintiffs want to
introduce new case and new cause of action claiming the damages on
account of loss of profit, which is not permissible and which is not
required to be granted. It is submitted that if such an amendment is
permitted to be allowed, in that case, cause of action claiming
damages towards loss of profit would be barred by limitation. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_16">9.		Mr.Manav
Mehta, learned advocate appearing on behalf of the defendants has
relied upon the following decisions of the Hon'ble Supreme Court as
well as Madhya Pradesh High Court:-

<p id="p_20">		By
making above submissions, it is requested to dismiss the present
application. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_21">10.		Heard
learned advocates appearing on behalf of the respective parties at
length. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_22">11.		At
the outset, it is required to be noted that initially Civil Suit came
to be instituted by the applicants   original plaintiffs before
learned District Court, Valsad in the year 2005 being Civil Suit No.1
of 2005 seeking perpetual order of injunction restraining the
opponents   original defendants from  in any manner manufacturing
and/or offering for sale the said product viz. Phosphorous
Pentachloride, or applying the invention covered by the said Patent
No.172459 for manufacture of Phosphorous Pentachloride. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_23">12.		At
the time of filing of the suit  in the plaint, the plaintiffs have
claimed damages quantified at Rs.1 Crore by submitting that by reason
of the acts of infringement committed by the defendants, the
plaintiffs have suffered damages then estimated at Rs.1,00,00,000/-
(Rupees One Crore only) and in the alternative, the applicants have
prayed for a decree directing the defendants to render a true and
faithful account of all the profits earned by the defendants by
selling the said product and that the defendants be further ordered
and decreed to pay to the applicants such amount as may be found due
on such account being taken.
</p> 


<p id="p_24">		Thus,
from the above, it is clear that the claim made by the plaintiffs for
a sum of Rs.1 Crore is by way of damages only and not claiming
damages for loss of profit. At the time of filing of the Suit, the
claim of the plaintiffs by way of damages of Rs.1 Crore was not with
respect to loss of profit at all. By way of proposed amendment, the
plaintiffs want to amend the plaint and to enhance the claim from
Rs.1,00,00,000/- (Rupees one Crore only) to Rs.10,64,00,000/- (Rupees
Ten Crores Sixty Four Lacs only) by way of damages due to loss of
profit by submitting that the sales of the infringing product  
Phosphorous Pentachloride made by the defendants for the period 2003
to 2010 is about 4257 metric tons and the defendants is likely to
make profit of Rs.15/- per kg. of Phosphorous Pentachloride.
Therefore, under the guise of amendment by enhancing the claim
towards Rs.1,00,00,000/- to Rs.10,64,00,000/- the plaintiffs want to
claim the damages for loss of profit, which was never the claim of
the plaintiffs at all in the plaint. Thus, it appears to the Court
that by way of amendment, pleadings and praying for enhancing of the
claim of damages for loss of profit, the plaintiffs want to introduce
a new case or a new cause  of action, which is not permissible. [see
decision rendered by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of
Mr.A.K.Gupta &amp; Sons Ltd. (Supra)]. If the plaintiffs are
permitted to amend the plaint as prayed for and substitute Paragraph
Nos.12, 16 and 21(b), in that case, entire nature of the claim
towards damages is likely to be changed and it is likely to introduce
a new case claiming damages towards loss of profit. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_25">13.		It
is also required to be noted at this stage that even otherwise, the
prayer of the applicants   original plaintiffs to permit them to
amend the plaint is not only belated but in view of the order passed
by the Apex Court, the same cannot be granted now as it is likely to
delay the proceedings. It is to be noted that the Civil Suit is of
the year 2005 and vide order dated 02/02/2009, the learned Single
Judge granted interim injunction below Exh-5 by restraining the
defendants from in any manner manufacturing and/or offering for sale
the said product viz. Phosphorous Pentachloride, or applying the
invention covered by the said Patent No.172459 for manufacture of
Phosphorous Pentachloride.  By order below Exh-5, it is also directed
to file the statement of accounts right from the beginning till the
date of disposal of Exh-5  so far as the same is related to the  
manufacture of Phosphorous Pentachloride and profits derived
therefrom by them. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_26">14.		It
is to be noted that against interim injunction granted by learned
Single Judge of this Court, the defendants approached the Hon'ble
Supreme Court by way of Civil Appeal No.271 of 2010. Initially an
injunction was granted by the learned Single Judge and, thereafter,
the Hon'ble Supreme Court disposed of the said Civil Appeal vide
order dated 13/01/2010 and Hon'ble Supreme Court passed the following
order :
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_27"> In
the facts and circumstances of this case, we direct the Trial Court
to conclude the hearing of the suit and decide the same as
expeditiously as possible, in any event, within a period of three
months from the date of communication of this order. The Trial Court
shall decide the suit without being influenced by the orders of any
Court, including this Court. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_28">	The
parties are directed to appear before the Court concerned on 25th
January,2010. The parties shall cooperate with the Trial Court and
the learned Presiding Judge of the Trial Court is requested to avoid
giving unnecessary adjournments in this case.
</p> 


<p id="p_29">	The
interim order of stay granted by this Court shall continue to operate
until the disposal of the suit. 
</p>
 


<p id="p_30">	The
appeal is disposed of with the aforementioned observations and
directions. 
</p> 


 


 


 


 


<p id="p_31">		Thereafter,
parties were directed to appear before this Court on 25/1/2010. It
appears from the proceedings of the Suit that the writ of the order
of the Hon'ble Supreme Court was received by this Court on 29/01/2010
and the Civil Suit was placed before this Court on 11/2/2010 and this
Court passed the following order on 11/02/2010:-
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_32"> Learned
Advocates, Shri Bijal Chhatrapati and Shri Manav Mehta, appearing for
the plaintiff and defendant respectively jointly pray for time. In
light of the direction of the Apex Court learned Advocates are
permitted to place on record a schedule proposing how the parties
intend to proceed to enable the Court to decide the suit after
hearing within a period of three months from 29/01/2010, which is the
date of receipt of the order by the Registry of this High Court.
Matter to come up on 15/02/2010. 
</p> 


  

 


 


 


<p id="p_33">		Thereafter,
learned Single Judge vide order dated 16/02/2010 fixed schedule with
respect to hearing of the suit as jointly proposed by learned
advocates appearing on behalf of the respective parties and this
Court passed the following order on 16/2/2010 :

<p id="p_49">		Matter

</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_50">15.		That
thereafter, the learned Single Judge framed the issues on 24/02/2010
and even appointed the Commissioner to record the evidence and at
that stage, the applicants   original plaintiffs have instituted
the present Civil Application for amendment, as stated hereinabove,
introducing altogether a new case claiming damages towards loss of
profit, which is derived by the plaintiffs. In view of the above, the
present Civil Application cannot be granted and deserves to be
dismissed as the applicants   original plaintiffs cannot be
permitted to introduce altogether a new case for damages towards loss
of profit, which was never prayed by them at the time of filing of
the Civil Suit. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_51">16.		Now,
so far as reliance placed upon the decisions of the Hon'ble Supreme
Court by learned advocate appearing on behalf of the applicants  
original plaintiffs, as referred hereinabove, are all in the facts
and circumstances and are not applicable and/or of any assistance to
the applicants to the facts of the present case. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_52">17.		In
the case before the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Ragu
Thilak D. John (Supra) upon the reliance placed by learned
advocate appearing on behalf of the applicants, a suit was filed for
permanent injunction restraining the defendants from demolishing
compound wall of the suit property and during the pendency of the
suit, the defendants demolished the compound wall and, therefore,
plaintiffs prayed for recovery of damages. In the aforesaid facts and
circumstances, the Hon'ble Supreme Court permitted plaintiffs to
amend the plaint keeping the question with respect to limitation
open. In the present case, as stated hereinabove, the question is not
only with respect to limitation but the question is by proposed
amendment, the applicants- original plaintiffs want to introduce
altogether a new case by way of damages on account of loss of profit,
which was never pleaded/claimed by the plaintiffs, while claiming
