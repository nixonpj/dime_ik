                      direct the respondents to consider Teaching Experience gained by

                      submission that the petitioner acquired the qualification of B.Sc

                      (Physics) in the year 1991 and M.Sc(Computer Science) in the year

                      1995. Subsequently, the petitioner passed National Eligibility Test

                      (NET) on 12.11.2012. Accordingly, he registered his name in the

                      employment exchange for the purpose of securing employment to

                      the post of Assistant Professor in Government Colleges.

</p><p id="p_4">                            3.The grievance of the writ petitioner is that he was serving as

                      a Assistant Professor in the Government Aided post in St. Xaviers

                      College in leave vacancy which was duly approved by the

                      Department. Therefore, he is entitled to get 15 marks as weightage

                      marks for his teaching experience. However, the respondents have

                      not granted 15 marks to the writ petitioner. Thus, the petitioner is

                      constrained to move the present writ petition.



</p><p id="p_5">                            4. The learned Government Advocate appearing on behalf of

                      the respondents made a submission that the writ petitioner is not

                      entitled to get 15 marks for his teaching experience. As per the

                      certificates produced by the writ petitioner, two marks were granted

                      for teaching experience and five marks were granted for educational

                      qualification. Accordingly, seven marks were granted for the writ

                      petitioner at the time of selection process.

                      respondents brought to the notice of this Court that the teaching

                      experience was reckoned from the date of acquisition of National

                      Eligibility Test (NET) by the respective candidates and uniformity

                      was being followed while granting marks to teaching experience of


http://www.judis.nic.in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                                          4</span>

                      the candidates. The candidates who acquired the educational

                      qualification is entitled to get marks for teaching experience as per

                      the guidelines issued by the respondents. Thus, no discrimination

                      was caused to the writ petitioner while awarding marks to the

                      teaching experience.
</p>
<p id="p_7">

</p><p id="p_8">                            6. This Court is of an opinion that when the procedure and

                      guidelines are followed by the Department for grant of teaching

                      experience to the teachers, the same is to be granted uniformly. In

                      the present case, admittedly, uniform procedure has been followed

                      at the time of grant of marks to the teaching experience. This being

                      the factum, the writ petitioner cannot seek indulgence of this Court to

                      award 15 marks as weightage marks for teaching experience. The

                      Court is incompetent to grant such marks contrary to the guidelines

                      issued in this regard by the experts who formulated such guidelines

                      for the purpose of selection of such teaching staff. In respect of

                      experts opinion of the guidelines, the Hon'ble Supreme Court of

                      India in the case of <a href="/doc/117716165/" id="a_2">U.P. Public Service Commission v. Rahul Singh</a>

                      reported in 2018 (7) SCC 254 and it is relevant to extract the

                      following paragraphs:

http://www.judis.nic.in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                                            5</span>

                             ''13. As far as the present case is concerned, even
                          before publishing the first list of key answers the
                          Commission had got the key answers moderated by two
                          Expert Committees. Thereafter, objections were invited
                          and a 26-member Committee was constituted to verify the
                          objections   and   after   this       exercise   the   Committee
                          recommended that 5 questions be deleted and in 2
                          questions, key answers be changed. It can be presumed
                          that these Committees consisted of experts in various
                          subjects for which the examinees were tested. Judges
                          cannot take on the role of experts in academic matters.
                          Unless, the candidate demonstrates that the key answers
                          are patently wrong on the face of it, the courts cannot
                          enter into the academic field, weigh the pros and cons of
                          the arguments given by both sides and then come to the
                          conclusion as to which of the answers is better or more
                          correct.
</p><p id="p_10">                             14. In the present case, we find that all the three
                          questions needed a long process of reasoning and the
                          High Court itself has noticed that the stand of the
                          Commission is also supported by certain textbooks. When
                          there are conflicting views, then the court must bow down
                          to the opinion of the experts. Judges are not and cannot
                          be experts in all fields and, therefore, they must exercise
                          great restraint and should not overstep their jurisdiction to
                          upset the opinion of the experts.
</p><p id="p_11">                             15. In view of the above discussion, we are clearly of
                          the view that the High Court overstepped its jurisdiction by


http://www.judis.nic.in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                                           6</span>

                           giving the directions which amounted to setting aside the
                           decision of experts in the field. As far as the objection of
                           the appellant Rahul Singh is concerned, after going
                           through the question on which he raised an objection, we
                           ourselves are of the prima facie view that the answer
                           given by the Commission is correct.''
</p><p id="p_12">                            7. Regularization in respect of grant of teaching experience

                      and other qualification are fixed with the assistance of the expert

                      committee. This being the factum of the case, this Court cannot

                      grant 15 marks as weightage marks for the teaching experience in

                      violation of the guidelines issued by the respondents in this regard.

                      This being the factum of the case, the writ petitioner has not

                      established any acceptable ground for the purpose of grant of relief

                      as such sought for in the present writ petition.



</p><p id="p_13">                            8. Accordingly, the writ petition stands dismissed. However,

                      there shall be no order as to costs. Consequently connected

                      miscellaneous petition is closed.
