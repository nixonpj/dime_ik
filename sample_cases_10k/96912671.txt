                    TIS HAZARI COURTS, DELHI

E-118/12

Gurpreet Kaur Bhalla Vs. Sudesh Kumar Suri

                                     ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">09/07/2013

              The present application u/O 6 Rule 17 CPC is moved by the
respondent for amendment of leave to defend application filed by the
respondent.
</p><p id="p_2">              The present eviction petition has been filed by the petitioner u/S
14(1)(e) of DRC Act on 19.10.12 on the ground of her bonafide requirement
stating therein that she requires the tenanted property for carrying on her
business of ladies Boutique for earning her livlihood.
</p><p id="p_3">              The petitioner has stated herself as owner and landlord of property
bearing no. J-8/77 E, Rajouri Garden, New Delhi - 110 027 (hereinafter
referred as suit property). The suit property consists of ground floor having
two shops, first floor and second floor. The respondent was inducted as tenant
in one shop on the ground floor of the suit property in the year 1979 on the rent
@ Rs. 150/- per month which increased time to time and at present rent is Rs.
1,500/- per month.
</p><p id="p_4">              Notice of the eviction petition was sent to the respondent who in
response filed his leave to defend application on 21/01/2012, admitting
relationship of landlord and tenant between the parties. The respondent stated
that in the other shop on the ground floor of the suit property is under the
tenancy of some other person, however this contention is denied by the
petitioner in rejoinder.
</p><p id="p_5">              Now, by way of application in hand, respondent wants to amend his

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                        1</span>
 leave to defend application. The amendments sought by the respondent is two
fold. The respondent wants two facts in leave to defend application, first, that
petitioner is a house wife and has no qualification for running boutique and
second that subsequent to filing of leave to defend application it came into the
knowledge of the respondent that petitioner has sold the other shop on the
ground floor of the suit property to some lady namely Smt. Bedi Kaur.
</p><p id="p_6">            Reply is filed by the petitioner/landlord. In reply, petitioner stated
that she is a qualified fashion designer from Ahina Polytechnic, New Delhi and
has experience of Export House. She has also filed photocopy of certificate of
aforesaid Institute. Petitioner admitted that he has sold the other shop on the
ground floor of the suit property to Ms. S. Kaur Bediin June 2012. It is further
stated that since the year 1991, husband namely Sh. Satinder Pal Singh and
father-in-law namely Sh. Swaran Singh of the Ms. S. Kaur Bediwere the tenants
in the other shop of the suit property. They were running the business of ready-
made garments from that shop and the shop was sold to wife of Sh. Swaran
Singh who is daughter-in-law of Sh. Satinder Pal Singh. It is further stated that
at present also the father-in-law and husband of Ms. S. Kaur Bediare doing the
same business of ready-made garments from that other shop.            It is further
stated that the fact of selling of shop by the petitioner to her tenants was in the
knowledge of respondent even at the time of selling of shop.
</p><p id="p_7">            I have heard Ld. Counsel for the parties.
</p><p id="p_8">            Ld. Counsel for the respondent argued that the fact of selling the
second shop of the suit property came to the knowledge of the respondent after
filing the leave to defend application. He submits that in Dr. Ashok Jolly Vs.
Shashi Prabha, CM (M) 770/12, the Honb'le High Court of Delhi has held that
leave to defend application in the rent matters can be amended if the
subsequent events are brought on record by the parties.           In counter, Ld.
Counsel for the petitioner argued that the leave to defend application can be


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                         2</span>
 amended if there is any subsequent event, but in the case in hand, fact of selling
of shop was in the knowledge of entire locality where the suit property is situated
and was also in the knowledge of the respondent and the same did not come in
his knowledge subsequently, hence the same is not the subsequent event which
came into his knowledge as alleged.          To substantiate his contention, Ld.
Counsel for the petitioner has relied upon Madhu Gupta Vs. Gardenia Estates
(P) Ltd, 184 (2011) DLT 103 Where it has held by Hon'ble High Court that the
amendment in leave to defend application is not permissible unless there are
subsequent events.
</p><p id="p_9">            The petition was filed in October, 2012 and admittedly, the second
shop was sold by the petitioner to Ms. S. Kaur Bedi in April, 2012.            Un-
disputedly the said shop of suit property was sold by the petitioner to Ms. S.
Kaur Bedi even prior to filing the present petition. Now the question before me is
whether the respondent came to know about the fact of selling of second shop
before filing of leave to defend application or afterwards. Now, I come on leave
to defend application filed by respondent on 21.11.2012. In the said leave to
defend application, respondent categorically stated that the said second shop
has been recently let out by the petitioner to some other tenant, however, same
is denied by the petitioner in rejoinder. Respondent has not disputed that the
said shop has been sold by the petitioner to Ms. S. Kaur Bedi who is wife and
daughter-in-law of tenants. It is also admitted by the respondent that husband
and father-in-law of Ms. S. Kaur Bedi are still running the same business from
that second shop. In this background the only question coming in my mind is
when same persons were in the occupation of the second shop then how
respondent took the stand in leave to defend application that the said shop has
been recently let out by the petitioner to some other person, this clearly implies
that it was in the knowledge of the respondent before filing the leave to defend
application that the shop has been sold by the petitioner to someone else which


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                         3</span>
 he did not plead in leave to defend application. Otherwise also, the respondent
in the application in hand, has nowhere stated from where he suddenly got the
information regarding selling of second shop to Ms. S. Kaur Bedi. In Madhu
Gupta Vs. Gardenia Estates (P) Ltd, 184 (2011) DLT 103 it has been held that
the facts which were pre-existing and in the knowledge of the party cannot be
termed as subsequent events. The judgment of Dr. Ashok Jolly (Supra) does
not apply to the facts of the present case since in that case the subsequent
event sought to be incorporated by the tenant in leave to defend application was
availability of alternate accommodation to the petitioner after filing leave to
defend application.
</p><p id="p_10">            In view of the aforesaid discussion, the present application is
dismissed. Put up for arguments on leave to defend application on 10/09/2013.
