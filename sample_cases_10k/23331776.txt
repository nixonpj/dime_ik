    CORAM: HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE AJAY KUMAR TRIPATHI
    ORAL JUDGMENT
    Date: 15-01-2015

                             Four set of writ applications have been taken up

            together for consideration and adjudication because petitioners

            of all these writ petitions are in the same predicament. They are

            looking for common kind of relief from the High Court.

</p><p id="p_53">                             The petitioners, who were recruited on the basis of

            2008 advertisements have all been terminated from the post of

            Subject Matter Specialist which became the reason for them to

            approach the High Court and seek not only quashing of the

            order of termination but also the order of show cause issued to

            them and ironically even some of the terms and conditions of

            the 2008 advertisement which formed the basis for their
 Patna High Court CWJC No.5768 of 2014 dt.15-01-2015                           5




            recruitment in the very first place.
</p>
<p id="p_54">                             Since, C.W.J.C. No. 5768 of 2014, which is the

            case of Rakesh Kumar Prasad and Ors. Vrs. Bihar Agricultural

            University and Ors. is the primary writ which was taken up for

            arguments since pleadings have been completed in that writ

            application, the reference to various Annexures will be confined

            and would be referable to the said writ and its pleadings.

</p><p id="p_55">                             On 4th of April, 2008, in terms of Annexure-4, the

            Rajendra Agriculture University, Bihar invited applications for

            various posts. We are concerned with the post of Subject Matter

            Specialist (S.M.S.) to be appointed or deployed in what is known

            as Krishi Vigyan Kendra. Besides other eligibility the basic

            qualification has also been laid down in the said advertisement.

            The bone of contention is one of the clause, which was part and

            parcel of the advertisement, that candidates with Masters

            degree with the relevant subject from an Indian University must

            also be N.E.T. qualified. No doubt, the advertisement also talks

            about relaxation in N.E.T. qualification for a candidate having

            two years of teaching/research/extension education experience

            in University/National Institute of Repute.

</p><p id="p_56">                             Such concession or exemption has been also

            extended to persons with Ph.D degree.
</p>
<p id="p_57">                             Recruitment process was gone through. Selected

            candidates which included these petitioners, without N.E.T.

            qualification came to be appointed. The offer of appointment is
 Patna High Court CWJC No.5768 of 2014 dt.15-01-2015                            6




            Annexure-4 series, dated 06.06.2009. Clause-16 of the said

            communication dated 06.06.2009 reiterates the position that

            candidates having Masters degree in the relevant subject and

            who have not qualified N.E.T. examination will have to pass the

            N.E.T. examination before completion of three years, failing

            which his/her services shall be terminated without any notice.

</p><p id="p_58">                             If this was not enough, all the selected candidates

            were also given a direction to execute a bond giving an

            undertaking with regard to the requirement of passing the

            N.E.T. examination within the time frame indicated in the offer

            letter. One such bond is Annexure-H in reply on behalf of the

            Agriculture University to the supplementary affidavit of the

            petitioners.
</p>
<p id="p_59">                             A reading of the bond specially, Clause-iii again

            reiterates the position of the obligation of the candidates to pass

            N.E.T. examination within three years or else they were liable to

            be terminated without notice.
</p>
<p id="p_60">                             Thereafter or what ever reasons, the University

            granted two years of additional time to these candidates to pass

            the N.E.T. examination, meaning thereby that a window of five

            years was opened to the selected candidates to qualify the

            N.E.T. and retain their job under the respondents. Since none of

            the petitioners before this Court passed the N.E.T. examination,

            they were issued show causes on 18.11.2013, some of which

            are Annexure-6 series and failing to provide proof of passing of
 Patna High Court CWJC No.5768 of 2014 dt.15-01-2015                           7




            N.E.T. or satisfactory explanation for not doing so, the

            respondent authorities finally terminated them from service in

            terms of Annexure-18 series, which are dated 09.06.2014 and

            10.06.2014.
</p>
<p id="p_61">                             As things stand, the petitioners now seek quashing

            of certain clause of Annexure-1 the advertisement dated

            04.04.2008, the show causes contained in Annexure-6 series as

            well as the order of termination i.e. Annexure-18 series.

</p><p id="p_62">                             Argument has been made at the bar in support of

            such a prayer primarily on the ground that the University

            authorities had no business to lay down in the advertisement

            requirement of passing of N.E.T. for Subject Matter Specialist

            because the controlling authority, which is the Indian Council

            for Agriculture Research does not lay down such a qualification

            or eligibility for appointment or selection on such post. The

            minimum requirement which has been laid down by Indian

            Council of Agriculture Research is Post Graduate degree in the

            concerned subject. If the University has put extra additional

            minimum qualification, it violates the directive, if not the

            guidelines of I.C.A.R.

<p id="p_63">                             From the various documents which have been

            annexed with the writ applications to support this contention,

            it is urged that all these petitioners had the basic qualification,

            when they were selected, and that it was irrational, if not illegal

            on the part of the University to demand passing of N.E.T.
 Patna High Court CWJC No.5768 of 2014 dt.15-01-2015                                  8




            examination to stay on to the post they were selected.

</p><p id="p_64">                             In the alternative, it is also argued that the

            amended statute which the University has talked about, which

            according to them conferred them the power to include N.E.T.

            as mandatory for recruitment on the post of Subject Matter

            Specialist is primarily meant for Teachers and since these

            petitioners are not Teachers, therefore, there was no occasion or

            necessity for passing N.E.T. examination by them.

</p><p id="p_65">                             Counter affidavit has been filed both on behalf of

            Indian     Council      of   Agriculture   Research   as   well   as   the

            Agriculture University. Since the stand of I.C.A.R. is very

            limited, therefore, the same is required to be noticed at the

            outset. From a reading of the same, it is evident that I.C.A.R.

            has laid down only the minimum qualification which is required

            for the said post. They do not emphatically take a stand that the

            minimum benchmark which they have laid down cannot be

            altered or changed. To make these difficult for the petitioners,

            they do talk about certain amount of leeway which has been

            granted to the recruiting agencies including State Agriculture

            Universities. This would be evident from reading of the answers

            to the query which the High Court had initially put on

            15.05.2014. To use the expression of I.C.A.R., they state that

            they have only led down a model qualification for filling up the

            post of S.M.S. in K.V.K. meaning Subject Matter Specialist in

            Krishi Vigyan Kendra across the country and is not compulsory

            or mandatory.
</p>
<p id="p_66">                             Since the I.C.A.R. has not taken a position that the

            Agriculture University in question is in violation of their

            guidelines and the parameters laid down by way of qualification,

            then it necessarily means that the qualification laid down by

            I.C.A.R. is the minimum benchmark which is required to be

            met. It in no manner creates an embargo upon the Agriculture

            University not to raise the bar with regard to the qualification. A

            stand is taken by University that by raising the bar better

            qualified candidates can be appointed on the post, then it be so.

            The necessity for passing N.E.T. examination a condition laid

            down in the advertisement, issued by the University, cannot be

            said to be in violation of any statute, guidelines or requirement

            under any law as such.
</p>
<p id="p_67">                             Coming to the stand taken by the University,

            learned counsel representing the University submits that the

            writ application is required to be thrown out at the threshold for

            the reason that all these petitioners accepted the terms and

            conditions of the advertisement without any challenge at any

            stage. They went through the process of recruitment, they

            accepted the letter of appointment with the said condition that

            they were required to pass N.E.T. examination within three

            years and they further executed a bond as an undertaking that

            they will abide by their conditional selection and appointment

            subject to fulfilling the eligibility in terms of the advertisement
 Patna High Court CWJC No.5768 of 2014 dt.15-01-2015                                       10




            within a time frame. It is too late in the day for them to

            challenge the qualification, which the University demands after

            they have been terminated for failing to pass the N.E.T.

            examination. The arguments made at the bar on behalf of the

            petitioners is only to dilute the rigours of a decision, which the

            University was forced to take for reasons attributable to the

            petitioners and not to the University. The petitioners had

            accepted the conditional appointment with eyes wide open.

</p><p id="p_68">                             All along the petitioners were made aware and

            knew the position that their selection and continuance on the

            post    was     contingent       and      subject   to   passing    of    N.E.T.

            examination        by    them.      The     University    was      more    than

            magnanimous in the sense that instead of initial three years

            they had granted two additional years to pass the examination

            in question. But since they failed to do so, they cannot be

            retained in service by quashing a clause of the advertisement

            and a selection made way back in the year 2009.

</p><p id="p_69">                             The University counsel further harps on the

            position taken by Indian Council for Agriculture research that

            their directive only lays down the minimum benchmark or

            qualification. There is no embargo on raising the benchmark.

</p><p id="p_70">                             What is urged at the bar on behalf of the

            petitioners that they are not Teachers or Assistant Professors in

            the strict sense of the term is correct. But merely because it is

            so it does not mean that insistence on N.E.T. is a rigorous
 Patna High Court CWJC No.5768 of 2014 dt.15-01-2015                              11




            requirement placed by the University. The Court has gone

            through the kind of responsibility and the duty which is

            required to be performed by Subject Matter Specialist. From

            reading of the object and purpose for creation of the post, the

            responsibility or duty conferred upon them is more onerous

            than that of a teacher. They are an important cog in the wheel

            behind the object for which the post and K.V.K. has been

            created and established.
</p>
<p id="p_71">                             In the entirety, therefore, the plea of the petitioners

            for interfering with the conditions of advertisement at this

            belated stage is far fetched kind of prayer which has been made.

            Such a relief cannot be granted to the petitioners after they have

            enjoyed the privilege of selection without going through the

            eligibility which they were required to fulfill. They have also

            been given indulgence of five years. Having failed to pass in so

            many years they cannot be permitted to challenge a clause of

            advertisement issued on 4th April, 2008. Such concession will

            be inequitable kind of relief, which this Court cannot give or

            grant.
</p>
<p id="p_72">                             Since the reason for termination is attributable to

            the petitioners and they have failed to qualify the N.E.T.

            examination in the five years of time slot made available to

            them, the reason of termination cannot be said to be arbitrary

            or unsustainable in any manner.
</p>
<p id="p_73">                             Any kind of dilution of eligibility or requirement of
          Patna High Court CWJC No.5768 of 2014 dt.15-01-2015                                   12




                     such selection at this belated stage in fact, would be in violation

                     of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution as well. Further such

                     dilution cannot be made from a retrospective date after the

                     entire selection process was completed and appointment made.

                     The petitioners are estopped from doing so.

</p><p id="p_74">                                      Counsel representing the University further points

                     out that the University has now issued notification that the

                     minimum qualification of N.E.T. is a must for all future

                     recruitment for such post. This only strengthens the position for

                     not interfering with the earlier advertisement because the

                     University has not diluted the requirement even for future

                     recruitment. Since the rigour of passing N.E.T. has come to stay

                     and     since    the    petitioners       have   not   passed   the   N.E.T.

                     examination in the last five years of their continuance on the

                     post. They cannot be given any concession now by either

                     interfering with the advertisement or with the orders of

                     termination.
</p>
<p id="p_75">                                      The writ applications, therefore, are dismissed for

                     the reasons indicated above.
