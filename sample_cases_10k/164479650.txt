CORAM:       HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE P.B. BAJANTHRI

      1)     Whether Reporters of the local papers may be
             allowed to see the judgment?
      2)     To be referred to the Reporters or not?
      3)     Whether the judgment should be reported in the

Present:     Mr. Rajeev Sharma, Advocate for
             Mr. J.S. Dadwal, Advocate for the petitioner.

<p id="p_1">P.B. Bajanthri, J.(Oral)

             In the present petition, the petitioner has questioned

the   order/communication                dated     25.07.2014    passed   by

respondent No. 2 by which claim of the petitioner for

compassionate appointment has been rejected.

</p><p id="p_2">             Brief facts of the case are that the petitioner's father

(deceased Harbans Singh) joined service on 09.11.1979.                    He

died on 08.03.2005. It is stated that on 26.02.2006 the

petitioner     moved       an            application    for   compassionate

appointment.        The respondents have rejected claim of the

petitioner on 30.04.2010.           Thereafter petitioner        approached

the respondents by making representation for re-consideration

to appoint him on compassionate ground. On 25.07.2014 once

again, claim of the petitioner had been rejected with reference

to the compassionate appointment Rules.
</p>
<p id="p_3">            Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that

rejection   of     the    petitioner's        claim   for    compassionate

appointment       vide    Communication          dated      30.04.2010   and

25.07.2014 is highly arbitrary, therefore, it is to be set-aside.

</p><p id="p_4">            Heard learned counsel for the petitioner.

            Having regard to the fact that petitioner's father

passed away on 08.03.2005 and the petitioner was pursuing

claim of compassionate appointment from 2006 to 2015, which

indicates that there is no hardness in the family so as to seek

compassionate appointment.                  The petitioner has failed to

question    the    rejection     of     his   claim   for    compassionate

appointment vide communication dated 30.04.2010, thereafter

he slept over the matter for nearly four years.                Ultimately, a

decision was taken by the respondents for the second time on

25.07.2014 in which claim of the petitioner has been rejected.

Even thereafter petitioner has taken one year time to approach

this   Court.     Claim   of   the      petitioner    for    compassionate

appointment is highly belated one.                On this ground,        the

present petition stands dismissed.</p><pre id="pre_2">
