:                           ORDER 
</pre><p id="p_1">This  Habeas  Corpus  Petition  coming  on  for orders,  upon
perusing  the  petition and the affidavit filed in support
thereof and upon hearing the arguments of Mr.  B.  Kumar, Senior
Counsel for  M/s.    R.    Loganathan  on  behalf  of  the
petitioner and of   Mr.    I.    Subramanian,  Public  Prosecutor
appearing on behalf of respondents 1 and 3 as well as of Mr.  Su.
Srinivasan, Additional Central Government  Standing  Counsel  for
the  second  respondent/Central  Government, passed the following
order :
</p>
<p id="p_2">P.  SHANMUGAM, J.       The above writ petition is filed for  the
issue  of  a  Writ of Habeas Corpus by calling for the records of
the first respondent connected with the Order  No.SR.I/590-5/2001
dated  12.6.2001  and set at liberty the detenu Lebaku Kanakaiah,
son of Lebaku Subbaiah, now detained in Central  Prison,  Chennai
under  the  provisions  of  Conservation  of Foreign Exchange and
<a href="/doc/135830564/" id="a_4">Prevention of Smuggling Activities Act</a>, 1974 <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_5">(Central Act</a>  52  of
1974).
</p>
<p id="p_3">        2.    According   to  the  petitioner,  Lebaku  Kanakaiah 
(hereinafter referred to as the detenu) had  gone  to  Kuwait  14
years  back  and  was  employed  originally  as  an Attender in a       
Government Organisation there; presently,  he  is  working  as  a
domestic servant.    He  does  not  know  to read or write in any
language and he can only understand Telugu.  He had not  come  to        
India even  once  in  the  last three years.  He came to India on
21.4.2001 to attend the marriage of one of his close relatives in
Andhra   Pradesh   from   Kuwait    via    Muscat    by    Flight
No.WY-850/21.4.2001.   In  the  same flight, Thiru Pothi Narayana
and Tmt.  Pothi Rajamma Narayana arrived as passengers  and  they        
were  intercepted  at  the exit gate of the Customs Arrival Hall.
On personal search,  the  brown  chappals  worn  by  Thiru  Pothi      
Narayana and  the  black  chappals  worn  by  Tmt.  Pothi Rajamma 
Narayana were found  unusally  heavy  and  after  questioning  of
concealment  of  any  contraband,  on  their  negative reply, the    
chappals were cut open and it was found that 12  nos.    of  gold
bars  of ten tolas each with foreign markings wrapped with carbon
papers were recovered from  the  chappals  worn  by  Thiru  Pothi      
Narayana and  8 nos.  of gold bars of ten tolas each with foreign
markings wrapped with  carbon  papers  were  recovered  from  the
chappals worn by  Tmt.    Path  Rajamma  Narayana.    On  further      
questioning, they replied that the said chappals  containing  the
gold  bars  were  given  to them by the detenu who arrived by the
same flight and identified him  near  the  green  channel.    The
contraband  items  were  seized  under mahazar for further action      
under  the  <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_6">Customs  Act</a>,  1962  readwith   the   Foreign   Trade
(Development and   <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_7">Regulation)  Act</a>,  1992.    On  the  basis  of
statements from those persons as well as  the  statement  of  the
detenu,  the  detenu  was  arrested  and  remanded  to custody on       
21.4.2001 and further detained by the order impugned herein.  The
representation made on behalf of the detenu dated 23.6 .2001  was
disposed of by the Government on 17.7.2001. 
</p>
<p id="p_4">        3.   The  grounds of detention dated 12.6.2001 state that
by attempting to import the  above  said  gold  bars  by  way  of
concealment  and  nondeclaration  with  the  intention of evading
customs  duty,  the  detenu  has   rendered   them   liable   for   
confiscation  and  his  further  action  by  not  making  a  true
declaration to the  customs  authorities,  he  has  committed  an
offence punishable under <a href="/doc/852376/" id="a_8">Sections 132</a> and <a href="/doc/1889775/" id="a_9">135</a> of the Customs Act, 
1962 and  penal  action  under  <a href="/doc/398879/" id="a_10">Section  112</a>.    According to the                
respondents, even though adjudication proceedings and prosecution
proceedings are likely to be initiated, the State  Government  is
satisfied  that  it  is  necessary to detain the detenu under the
provisions of the Conservation of Foreign Exchange and <a href="/doc/135830564/" id="a_11">Prevention
of Smuggling Activities Act</a>, 1974 with a view to prevent him from
indulging in smuggling goods in  future.    The  detention  order
dated 12.6.2001 is now under challenge.
</p>
<p id="p_5">        4.  Mr.   V.    Kumar,  learned senior counsel arguing on
behalf of the detenu made the following submissions as to how the
order of detention is not sustainable in law :
</p>
<p id="p_6">        (a) The documents and the grounds were not read over  and
explained  to  the  detenu  in  the  language  known to him, i.e.
Telugu. (b) The manifest  of  the  passengers'  list,  which  was
relied  upon,  was  given  only  in English and no translation in
Telugu is given and after specific request, the  translated  copy
was not explained and read over to him in Telugu.       (c)   The
solitary instance, assuming it to  be  true,  is  not  enough  to
sustain the order of detention. (d) The detention at Chennai, far
away from the native place of the detenu, is violative of <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_12">Article
21</a> of the Constitution of India.        (e) Delay in the disposal
of the representation.
</p>
<p id="p_7">        5.  The learned Public Prosecutor refuted all the grounds
raised  on  behalf of the petitioner and submitted that there are
no infirmities in the detention and that there is no violation in
the subsequent procedure in reference to the detenu.    According 
to  him,  it  is highly unbelievable that a person who is working
for 14 years in Kuwait does not know any language  except  Telugu
and  that  he  had  been  appraised  of  the order as well as the
grounds of detention, including the manifest.  He further submits
that even a solitary instance can form  the  basis  of  detention
considering the  nature  of  the activity.  In this case, a clear
case of concealment, disclosing a  planned  attempt  and  action,
calling for an order of detention is made out.  He also submitted 
that there is absolutely no delay in considering the represention
of  the  detenu  and referred to the various dates set out in the    
counter in justification of the time taken for  disposal  of  the
representation  and  he  thus  prayed  for  dismissal of the writ    
petition.
</p>
<p id="p_8">        6.  The detenu claims to be an illiterate and that he can
only understand and speak Telugu, which  is  his  mother  tongue.      
There is no contra evidence on this aspect and therefore, we take
it that  the  detenu  understands  and  speaks  Telugu.  His main
ground of challenge is that none of the documents and the grounds
of detention were read over and explained to him in Telugu.    In
support of this submission, he relies on the rubber stamp and the
signature  of  the  Preventive  Officer as well as the Data Entry
Operator, Customs House in the order of detention.  The  original
copy  of  the order of detention served on the detenu contains an
endorsement to the effect that the detenu had received the  copy,
it  was  explained in the language known to him and he understood
the matter completely.  He has signed as  token  having  received        
that detention  order  on  13.6.2001.    The  Preventive Officer,
Customs House has signed under a rubber stamp  which  says  'Read  
Over and  Explained  in Telugu'.  On the contrary, the grounds of
detention  running  to  nine  pages  dated  12.6.2001  served  on
16.6.2001   also  contained  the  endorsement  in  rubber  stamp.
However, these nine pages contain a rubber stamp  stating,  "Read
over and  explained  in  Hindi",  signed by T.  Venkateswara Rao,  
Data Entry Operator, Customs House, Chennai with date 16 .6.2001. 
</p>
<p id="p_9">        7.  The requirement to read over and explain in the  same
language  that a detenu understands, if he is an illiterate, is a
constitutional requirement.  The detention order will become void
on the fifth day of detention if the grounds of detention are not
communicated to the detenu.  The counter affidavit filed  by  the
Deputy  Secretary to the Government dated 21.11.2001 in reference
to this specific contention says in paragraph 5 as follows :
</p>
<p id="p_10">        "As a token of having explained in Telugu, an endorsement
'read over and explained in Telugu'  had  been  made  and  signed 
behind  each  of  the aforesaid document by the respective Telugu
Intermediator.  Thus, the contention that none of  the  documents  
were originally explained to the detenu at the time of service of
the  order of detention and that the documents were read over and
explained in Hindi and that the detenu, though an illiterate, has
not been read over  and  explained  the  grounds  in  Telugu  are
false."
</p>
<p id="p_11">Both  from the English version of the grounds of detention served
on the detenu on 16.6.2001 as well as the English translation  of
the  grounds  dated  16.6.2001 filed before this court as well as
from the copies of booklet supplied to the detenu, we  find  that
the  endorsement  was  originally  read over and explained to the
detenu in Hindi and not in Telugu as stated in the counter.   The
first  respondent  has  not even verified as to the furnishing of
the copies of the documents and the endorsement made  therein  on 
the  backside  of  those  documents,  especially  the  grounds of
detention.  The argument of the learned Public Prosecutor at this
stage that the officer had omitted to strike off the  word  Hindi
and write Telugu cannot be accepted.
</p>
<p id="p_12">        8.  In RAZIYA  VS.    UNION  OF  INDIA (A.I.R.  1980 S.C.         
1751), the Supreme Court held that if the grounds are couched  in
a  language  which  is  not  known  to  the detenu, the detaining
authority must see to it that the grounds are  explained  to  the
detenu,  a  translation is given to him and the grounds bear some      
sort of certificate that the grounds have been explained  to  the
detenu in a language which he understands.  A bare denial, at the
stage when a Habeas Corpus Petition is filed in the court, by the
detainaing  authority  that these formalities were observed would
be of no consequence, particularly when it is  not  supported  by
any  document  or by any affidavit of the person who has done the
explaining or  the   translation.      Non-compliance   of   this
constitutional safeguard would by itself be sufficient to vitiate
the  order  of  detention, thereby violating <a href="/doc/1709581/" id="a_13">Article 22(5)</a> of the
Constitution.   9.  Petitioner has filed H.C.M.P.  No.104 of 2001
raising a supplementary ground.  According to him, the subsequent
claim that the grounds of detention were read over and  explained
to  the  detenu,  who  is  an  illiterate,  in Telugu language is
contrary to the contemporaneous endorsement  made.    He  further
raises  a  point  that two of the documents were not in Telugu at
the time of service of the order of detention and that they  were
not read  over  and  explained  to  the  detenu  in  Telugu.  The       
Additional  Superintendent,  Central  Prison,  Chennai  did   not
explain  anything  to  the  detenu  and in all probabilities, the
Additional Superintendent of the Central Prison, who  signed  the
document, may  not  know Telugu at all.  In the counter affidavit
filed in reference to these additional grounds, it is stated that
at the time of serving of the documents, they had been read  over
and explained  to  the  detenu in the language known to him.  The
passenger manifest was clearly read over  and  explained  to  the
detenu  in  Telugu  by the Telugu Mediator at the time of serving
the grounds of detention.  The Telugu version  of  the  same  was  
received  from  the  Customs  Department and it was served to the
detenu on 19.7.2001.  However, in reference to the specific point
raised by the  petitioner  that  the  Additional  Superintendent,
Central  Prison  who  has signed under the endorsement 'read over
and explained in Telugu to the detenu and served on him' does not
know Telugu, has not been refuted.      10.   We  are   satisfied
that  the  essential  requirement  to communicate to the detained
person the grounds on which the detention order has been made  so 
as   to   afford   him  the  earliest  opportunity  of  making  a
representation has been violated in this case.  It has to be held
that there is no proper communication of the grounds of detention
and that the constitutional safeguard enshrined in <a href="/doc/1709581/" id="a_14">Article  22(5)</a>
of the  Constitution  of  India  has been violated.  In the above
circumstances, we are not inclined to go into the  other  grounds
raised and argued by the counsel.       11.     For   the   above
reasons, the order of detention is liable to be quashed and it is
accordingly quashed.    The  detenu  is  hereby  directed  to  be      
released  forthwith  unless  his  presence  is requirement in any
other case.  No costs.  Consequently, the connected H.C.M.P.   is 
closed.
