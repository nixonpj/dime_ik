<p id="p_1">JUDGMENT
 

H.S. Bedi, J.
</p> 

<p id="p_2">1. The tortuous round of litigation between the parties herein suggest that what is at stake is not only the custody of a physically handicapped minor, undoubtedly dear to them, but the 89 kanals of land which he owns which makes his custody not only more desirable, but positively attractive.
</p> 

<p id="p_3">2. The facts of the case as given are that one Habid Khan was married to Mst. Aishan, from whom three daughters, Mallan, Sheela (respondent Nos. 2 and 3) and Akbari, the present petitioner, were born. On Mst. Aishan's death some time later, Habib Khan entered into another marriage with respondent No. 1 Mst. Sabri and from that marriage the minor Wali Khan and two daughters were born. Habib Khan died on 15-9-1982. 
</p><p id="p_4">Respondent No. 1 thereafter married Ajmer Khan in the year 1984, abandoning Wali Khan and his sisters in their father's home and to the care of their step-sisters Akbari, Mallan and Sheela. Respondent No. 1 now laic claim to the 89 kanals of land of Habib Khan which had devolved by succession upon Wali Khan on the basis of a Will alleged to have been executed by him in her favour. This Will was challenged successfully by Wali Khan and others including the present petitioner. The finding of the Court was that the Will sought to be projected by respondent No. 1 had not been proved and the defendants in the suit i.e. Mst. Sabri and others could not succeed to the property on that basis. The matter did not end here and a suit was thereafter filed by the petitioner against respondent No. 1 praying for an injunction that the latter be restrained from taking the custody of Wali Khan in any manner other than in due process of law. This suit too was decreed vide judgment of the Trial Court dated 25-2-1987. Still dis satisfied, respondent No. 1 filed a writ of Habeas Corpus in this Court seeking the custody of the minor but the same was declined vide judgment of this Court dated 2-6-1988 Annexure P-2 to the petition though the Court in order to safeguard the interest of the minor, ordered a financial settlement in his favour keeping in view the income from the 89 kanals of land left to him by his father. The High Court, however, made no order as to the custody of the child who was admittedly at that stage in the defecto custody of the petitioner. Respondent No. 1 still persisted in her efforts and moved an application under <a href="/doc/358646/" id="a_1">Section 97</a> Cr. P.C. before the Court of the Sub-Divisional Magistrate, Fatehgarh Sahib who caused the minor to be produced before him, recorded his statement and on that basis disallowed the application and directed that be be restored to the custody of his sisters Mallan and Sheela at village Lang. Respondent No. 1 still not satisfied and displaying the tenacity of Robert Bruce's proverbial spider moved yet another an application (out of which the present proceedings arise) this time under Section 25 of the Guadians and <a href="/doc/1608688/" id="a_2">Wards Act</a>, 1908 (hereinafter called the 'Act') claiming the custody of the minor but impleading Sheela and Mallan as also the General Public, as respondents, but not Mst. Akbari the present petitioner. This application came up for the first time before the Guardian Court on 24-12-1991 and the following order was recorded :--
</p><p id="p_5"> "It be registered. Notice to General Public be issued for 30-1-1992 through publication in Daily Teer Kaman, Patiala. Notices to respondent Nos. 2 and 3 be also issued."
</p> 

<p id="p_6">3. On 30-1-1992, it was noted that the publication had been made but as none was present to file objections, the case was adjourned to 20-2-1992 for evidence of the applicant The ex parte evidence was, thereafter recorded and the order impugned in the present proceedings made whereby the custody of the minor Wali Khan was ordered to be given to respondent No. 1. Armed with the order of the Guardian Judge, a warrant for the custody of the minor was issued and in execution thereof he was handed over Mst. Sabri. It appears that it was at that stage that Sheela and Mallan respondent Nos. 2 and 3 who had been impleaded as parties but  apparently not served moved an application for the setting aside of the ex-parte order against them and those proceedings are now pending in the Court of the Guardian Judge at Patiala. The petitioner also aggrieved by the said order filed an appeal in the Court of the Additional District Judge, Patiala for having it sot-aside but the same was dismissed vide judgment dated 7-8-92 on the ground that as she was not a party to the proceedings before the Guardian Court, an appeal at her instance was not maintainable. It is in these circumstances that the present revision petition has been filed praying that the order dated 25-5-1992 made by the Guardian Judge be set-aside.
</p> 

<p id="p_7">4. It has been argued by Mr. S.C. Kapoor, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the petitioner that a revision petition was the only remedy available to her as she was not a party to the proceedings before the Guardian Court and for this purpose, he has placed reliance on Balu Mal v. Hardwari Mal, AIR 1924 Lah 570. He has also urged that the persons who had been impleaded were required to be served in person as per <a href="/doc/1881707/" id="a_3">Section 11</a> of the Act and even this was not done despite the order reproduced above having the been made to the effect and the Guardian Judge passed the order after publication in an obscure newspaper known as the 'Daily Teer Kaman'. He further argued that had the opposite party been represented before the Guardian Judge, the decision arrived at by him would not have been possible, as from the sequence of events, narrated above, it was clear that the interest of respondent No. 1 clashed with that of the minor and her efforts to secure his custody or grab his property had been frustrated by the Courts. It was also urged that the Guardian Judge ought to have at least examined the minor who was about 17 years of age before recording its conclusions.
</p> 

<p id="p_8">5. In reply, it was urged by Mr. H.S. Mann and Mr. Kanwaljit Singh Advocates for respondent No. 1 that as respondent Nos. 2 and 3 had already moved an application for the setting aside of the ex pane order of the Guardian Judge, no revision was competent before this Court and in fact the petitioner ought to have joined the proceedings before the Guardian Judge as held by the Additional District Judge, Patiala in his judgment dated 7-8-92. It was also urged that the petitioner was not a necessary party before the Guardian Judge as in the statement of the minor recorded by the Sub Divisional Magistrate in proceedings under <a href="/doc/1480339/" id="a_4">Section 27</a> of the Cr. P.C. he had himself desired to go to his sisters Sheela and Mallan who were residents of village Bang whereas Mst. Akbari was resident of village Jasowal. Lastly, it was urged that as there was no jurisdictional error committed by the Guardian Judge while making the order dated 25-5-1992, this Court would not interfere in the revision.
</p> 

<p id="p_9">6. After hearing the learned Counsel for the parties, I find substance in the stand taken by the petitioner and as such this petition must succeed.
</p> 

<p id="p_10">7. Taking up the first argument of Mr. Kapoor, it is apparent that the petitioner was not a party to the proceedings before the Guardian Judge and as such the only remedy available to her was by way of revision, as held in Ballu Mal's case (supra). It was held therein that a person, who was not made a party to the proceedings in a guardianship case, but to whom a notice should have been issued under <a href="/doc/1881707/" id="a_5">Section 11</a> of the Act, was a person interested in the matter of the appointment of a guardian and was entitled to move the High Court to interfere in revision. It was self evident that the  petitioner was a person who was interested in the outcome of the guardianship proceedings as she had been recognized as the defacto guardian of the minor by the Courts, on various occasions, including the judgment dated 25-2-1987 in which it was categorically directed that his custody could be taken away from her in due process of law only. Moreover, the import of the judgment of this Court in the Habeas Corpus proceedings Annexure P-2 to the petition was also that the petitioner and her husband Kangan Khan were the ones, who had been looking after the minor and it was on this account that a direction making a financial settlement for him was issued to them. The argument, therefore, that as in the proceedings under <a href="/doc/358646/" id="a_6">Section 97</a> of the Cr. P.C. the minor had stated that he wished to live with respondent No. 2 and 3 and as such Mst. Akbari was not a necessary party, is absolutely misconceived.
</p> 

<p id="p_11">8. The next argument of Mr. Kapoor is that even assuming for a moment that Mst. Akbari was not a necessary party even Respondent Nos. 2 &amp; 3 who were admittedly so were not duly served. He has referred to <a href="/doc/1881707/" id="a_7">Section 11</a> of the Act, which reads as under :--
</p> 

<p id="p_12">"<a href="/doc/1881707/" id="a_8">Section 11</a>. Procedure on admission of application :--(1) If the Court is satisfied that there is ground for proceedings on the application, it shall fix a day for the hearing thereof, and cause notice of the application and of the date fixed for the hearing :--
</p>  

<p id="p_13">(a)   to be served in the manner directed in<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_9"> the Code</a> of Civil Procedure on :--</p><pre id="pre_1">
 

(i)   the parents of the minor if they are residing in (any State to which the Act extends)
 

(ii) the person, if any, named in the petition or letter as having the custody or possession, of the person or property of the minor,
 

(iii) the person proposed in the application or letter to be appointed or declared guardian, unless that person is himself the applicant, and
 

(iv) any other person, to whom, in the opinion of the Court special notice of the application should be given; and
  (b) x              x              x              x              x              x"
 

</pre><p id="p_14">It will be seen from the above that service is to be effected in the manner directed by<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_10"> the Code</a> of Civil Procedure. Order V Rule 12 C.P.C. provides that ordinarily, wherever it is practicable service was required to be made on the defendant in person and it was in accordance with this injunction that the Guardian Judge had himself directed on 24-12-1991 that notice to the respondents, was also to issue in term of <a href="/doc/1267148/" id="a_11">Section 11(1)(a)(ii)</a> of the Act, but this was apparently not done. The mere publication in the newspaper 'Daily Teer Kaman' Patiala, therefore, did not satisfy the requirement of <a href="/doc/1881707/" id="a_12">Section 11</a> of the Act and for that additional reason also, the order under challenge cannot be sustained. The power under Section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure is wide enough to enable this Court to reach an illegality wherever it is and to remedy it and merely because Sheela and Mallan are before me as respondents do not preclude me from setting aside a patently illegal  order on this ground as well at the instance of the petitioner, especially when similar proceedings are pending before the Guardian Judge at the instance of the former.
</p> 

<p id="p_15">9. It has next been argued by Mr. Kapoor that as the interest of respondent 1 was adverse to that of the minor, no order appointing her guardian ought to have been made. I am, however, of the view that as the matter regarding guardianship is to be reconsidered by the Guardian Court consequential to this judgment, any finding recorded at this stage on this argument would prejudge and prejudice the decision and is, therefore, not warranted.
</p> 

<p id="p_16">10. The Counsel for the respondent next argued that as there was no error in the exercise of jurisdiction by the Guardian Judge in making the order impugned, no case for interference in these proceedings was called for. This argument too is misplaced. Once, it is found that a necessary party has not been impleaded and in any case even the parties who were impleaded have not been served as per requirements of law, the order suffers from serious jurisdictional errors and a glaring material irregularity, calling for immediate remedial action by this Court.
</p> 

<p id="p_17">11. The final argument raised by Mr. Mann in conclusion was that it was appropriate to record the statement of the minor at this stage. It was with this intention that I had directed that the minor be produced before me on 15-10-1992 vide order dated 29-9-1992. This order was conveyed to respondent No. 1 by her Counsel Mr. A.S. Kalra, Advocate. On 13-10-1992, Mr. Kanwaljit Singh who appeared for the said respondent prayed that he be allowed some time to produce the minor and the case was adjourned to 19-10-1992. On 19-10-1992, the child again did not appear and it was stated by respondent No. 1 who was present in person on that date that as he was physically handicapped, it was difficult for him to be produced in the Court. It was at this stage that I told her in the presence of her Counsel who was now Mr. H.S. Mann that if the minor was not produced in the Court on 21-10-1992, she would be liable to face proceedings under the <a href="/doc/1396751/" id="a_13">Contempt of Courts Act</a> and it was only thereafter and with extreme reluctance that the minor has been produced today in Court. It is quite possible, therefore, that the minor would not be a free agent. It is also significant that the case of respondent No. 1 before the Guardian Judge was that the minor was not only physically but mentally handicapped as well. Moreover, it appears that in the proceedings recorded the Sub Divisional Magistrate under <a href="/doc/358646/" id="a_14">Section 97</a> of the Cr.P.C., the minor had already stated that he would like to go to his sisters at village Lang and not with his mother Mst. Sabri. I, therefore, feel that it will be not in the interest of justice or even appropriate to record the statement of the minor at this stage.
</p> 

<p id="p_18">12. For the reasons recorded above, the present petition is allowed and the order dated 25-5-1992 is quashed and a direction is issued to respondent No. 1 to restore the child to respondent Nos. 2 and 3 from whom the custody was taken under the orders of the Guardian Judge. The parties are directed to appear before the Guardian Judge, Patiala on 29-10-1992 when the minor will be handed over in Court to the said respondent and if an effort is made to delay the event, the Guardian Judge shall take immediate steps to ensure that the order of this Court is complied with forth with. It is also directed that the petitioner will be treated as a co-respondent in the guardianship proceedings and shall be allowed to defend her case.
</p> 

<p id="p_19">13. From the tenor and conduct of the proceedings before me, it appears that the parties have their interests in the custody of the minor but equally in his property. Some direction is, therefore, required on this aspect as well. The minor is over 17 years of ago now and will reach the age of majority in a few months and will thereafter be in a position to decide things for himself. It is, therefore, directed that during the period of his minority, the petitioner, or respondents or any other person acting on his behalf would not be entitled to dispose off his property in any manner whatsoever and the orders of this Court in Criminal Writ Petition No. 921 of 1988(Annexure P-2) will continue to be complied with. It is, however, made clear that any observations made in this judgment will not prejudice or influence the outcome of the proceedings before the Guardian Judge and they are to be construed as having been made only for the limited purpose of the disposal of this petition.
