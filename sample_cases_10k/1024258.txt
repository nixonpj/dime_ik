</pre>

<p id="p_1">	In all these writ petitions, the prayer of  the petitioners, who are beedi
manufacturers, is to quash the order of the first respondent/State made in
G.O.(2D)No.45 Labour and Employment Department dated 15.7.2004.
</p>
<p id="p_2">	2. By the said notification, the Government has fixed the minimum wages in
respect of employments in "Tobacco including Beeding making other than beedi
rolling".

notification, the following rates were fixed, which is as follows:

revise the minimum rate of wages.  A final notification dated 20.4.1998 in
G.O.2(D) No.14, Labour &amp; Employment (J1), dated 20.4.1998 was issued superceding

1.50 per 1,000 beedies

employment, "Top labelling" was not included in the G.O.,.  However, by a
further notification dated 29.7.1999 in G.O.(2D)No.91, Labour and Employment,
the notification dated 20.4.1998 was superceded on the basis of the
circumstances explained by the Commissioner of Labour vide his letter dated

<p id="p_34">3.  To arrive at the daily wages, the monthly wages 	shall be divided by 26.
</p>
<p id="p_35">4.  To arrive at the monthly wages, the daily wages 	shall be multiplied by 30.
</p>
<p id="p_36">5.  Wherever the existing wages are higher than the 	minimum wages fixed
herein, the same shall be 	continued to be paid.
</p>

<p id="p_37">	10. The grievances of the managements are that the Notification was based
upon the report of the committee constituted by an order dated 20.4.2001 and
therefore, the report dated 30.9.1999 cannot have any role to play while issuing
such a notification.
</p>
<p id="p_38">	11. It was submitted that the fixation of minimum wages in the present
case is beyond the competency of the Government in terms of <a href="/doc/1299491/" id="a_4">Section 5</a> of the
Minimum Wages Act.  The Government had erred in going beyond its jurisdiction
and the impugned notification introduced a new element viz., 30% extra wages for
Top Labelling with dearness allowance.  It had ignored the fact that labelling
hitherto was done by the workers is inclusive of top labelling i.e. outer label
of bundles.  By this notification, hitherto, the work done by the same person
has been split up into two works thereby increasing the cost of production.
</p>
<p id="p_39">	12. It was further argued that by pasting the trade mark label on the
packet (known as "kattu") does not involve any serious work so as to make 30%
extra payment of wages.  By the present notification, in the name of revision of
wages, they have introduced a new element of top labelling and fixed a separate
payment.  The Government has also ignored the letter written by the employers'
association such as the South Tamil Nadu Beedi Manufacturers Association, which
requested the Government to include their members also as members of the
Advisory Committee.  This had resulted in  person being nominated by the
committee not being a stake holder.   The resultant wages fixed by the
Government was higher than the minimum wages fixed in the States of West Bengal,
Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka and Uttar pradesh.  By the thoughtless measure, the
wages have been increased many times without taking into account the actual
nature of work involved.  By the notification of the year 1989, the difference
between single wrapper and double wrapper was only one rupee whereas by the new
element of top labelling results in payment of 30% extra wages apart from
Dearness Allowance and this will increase the cost of production exorbitantly.
</p>
<p id="p_40">	13. Heard the arguments of Mr. S.Silambannan, learned Senior Counsel
appearing for Mr.S.Karthik for petitioners, Mr. AR.L.Sundaresan, learned Senior
Counsel appearing for AL.Ganthimathi for petitioners in the respective Writ
Petitions, Mrs.V.Chellammal, learned Special Government Pleader for all the
Official Respondents and Mr.S.Arunachalam, learned counsel for the impleaded
respondents and have perused the records.
</p>
<p id="p_41">	14. Since the Government filed no counter affidavit, the learned Special
Government Pleader was directed to produce the original G.O. file in
G.O.Ms.(2D)No.45 Labour and Employment Department, dated 15.7.2004.
Accordingly, the learned Special Government Pleader submitted the file for
perusal by this Court.
</p>
<p id="p_42">	15. With reference to the defect in the composition of the committee,
factually, such a situation does not arise.  Whether a particular  member sat at
a particular hearing at Tirunelveli is immaterial and also some of the members
from the Southern Districts were not included cannot be a relevant factor when
the minimum wages is fixed for the whole State and the employers' interest  was
well protected.   In fact, the employers' representatives were drawn from three
places viz., Chennai, Vellore and Tirunelveli.   If Mr. A.M. Masthan, who had
not chosen to participate at the Advisory Committee sittings at Tirunelveli, the
Government cannot be blamed for the absence of the one of the member.
Ultimately, the report is the product of cumulative effort of all concerned and
therefore, no exception can be taken about composition of the said committee.
</p>
<p id="p_43">	16. The Supreme Court vide its judgments in Edward Mills Co Ltd.,  Beawar
Vs. State of Ajmer (1954-II-LLJ 686) and also in <a href="/doc/1291554/" id="a_5">Bijay Cotton Mills Limited V.
State of Ajmer</a> (1955-I-LLJ 129) dealt with the fixation of minimum wages. In the
former case, it was observed that the legislative policy is apparent on the face
of the enactment.  What it aims at is the statutory fixation of the minimum
wages with a view to obviate the chances of exploitation of labour.  It is to
carry out the purpose of the enactment that power has been given to the
appropriate Government to decide with reference to local conditions whether it
is desirable that minimum wages should be fixed in regard to a particular trade
or industry.
</p>
<p id="p_44">	17. In Bijay Cotton Mills Ltd.,'s case (cited supra) while dealing with
<a href="/doc/1299491/" id="a_6">Section 5(c)</a>, the Supreme Court had observed as follows:
	"As regards the procedure for the fixing of minimum wages, the
'appropriate Government' has undoubtedly been given very large powers.  But it
has to take into consideration before fixing wages, the advise of the committee
if one is appointed, or the representations on its proposals made by persons who
are likely to be affected  thereby. Consultation with advisory bodies has been
made obligatory on all occasions of revision of minimum wages, and <a href="/doc/1850768/" id="a_7">Section 8</a> of
the Act provides for the appointment of a Central advisory Board for the purpose
of advising the Central as well as the State Government both in the matter of
fixing and revision of minimum wages.  Such Central advisory body is to act also
as a co-ordinating agent for co-ordinating the work of the different advisory
bodies.,  In the committees or the advisory bodies the employers and the
employees have an equal number of representatives and there are certain
independent members besides them who are expected to take a fair and impartial
view of the matter.  These provisions in our opinion, constitute an adequate
safeguard against any hasty or capricious decision by the 'appropriate
Government'.  In suitable cases the 'appropriate Government' has also been given
the power of granting exemptions from the operation of the provisions of this
Act."
</p>
<p id="p_45">	18. It is relevant to point out that the Tamil Nadu legislature by
amending <a href="/doc/142278/" id="a_8">Section 9-A</a> has introduced a new provision in the <a href="/doc/142278/" id="a_9">Minimum Wages Act</a> by
T.N.Act 47 of 1981 with effect from 1.10.1981, and the new section reads as
follows:
</p><p id="p_46">	"<a href="/doc/142278/" id="a_10">Section 9A</a>. Saving - No order of the State Government nominating any
person as the Chairman or a Member of the Advisory Board or a Committee or Sub-
Committee shall be called in question in any manner and no action or proceedings
before any Board, Committee or Sub-Committee shall be called in question in any
manner in any Court of law on the ground merely of the existence of any vacancy
in or of any defect or irregularity in the constitution of such Board, Committee
or Sub-Committee."
</p>
<p id="p_47">	19. Therefore,  the alleged defect in the composition of the committee, by
taking into account  particular areas of operation, cannot be accepted.  Areas
of operation such as Chennai, Vellore and Tirunelveli cannot make any
distinction in the matter of fixation of the minimum wage.  In fact, both
Tirunelveli and Chennai are having Corporations  whereas in the case of Vellore
and Vaniyambadi in North Arcot Districts, they are only municipalities.
</p>
<p id="p_48">	20. In fact, fixation of the minimum wage on the basis of different zones
in a particular State was also rejected by this Court in respect of the very
same petitioner in a batch of cases reported in  1996 (1) LLJ 598 [Muruga Home
Industries Vs. Government of Tamil Nadu and another].  The relevant passage
found in paras 23 and 24 of the said judgment are as follows:
Para 23: "It was also contended by learned counsel for the petitioner that the
principle of zoning was not followed before the minimum wages of the beedi
workers were revised by the first respondent.  In this connection, learned
counsel referred to the annexure to the affidavit, in the main writ petition and
pointed out the principle of "zoning" has been followed with regard to hotels,
cinemas and other industries whereby different wages have been fixed for
industries falling in different areas.  Learned counsel contended that the wages
of beedi workers vary in different districts of Tamil Nadu State and, therefore,
the principle of "zoning" ought to have been followed by the first respondent in
different zones.  In this connection, he pointed out that the representations
have been taken into consideration the wages prevailing mainly in the districts
of North Arcot, Trichy and Madurai, where as the factories of the petitioners
herein all are located in Tirunelveli, where the wages are not so high and this
aspect of the matter has not been considered ;by the first respondent.  On the
other hand, the learned Additional Government Pleader submitted that the
principles of "zoning" will not apply to beedi industry.  Mr. Chandru appearing
for the impleaded parties, submitted that the principle of "zoning" will not
apply to the beedi industries and in this connection, he referred to the ruling
in <a href="/doc/231208/" id="a_11">Kaley Khan v. State of Uttar Pradesh</a>, 1993 2 LLN 787 at 791 wherein a
Division Bench of the Allahabad High Court considering the principles of zoning
has observed as follows:
</p><p id="p_49"><a href="/doc/1801637/" id="a_12">In Chandra Bhavan Boarding and Lodging V. State of Mysore</a> (supra), the Supreme
Court held thus (at page 411)
"The fixation of minimum wages depends on the prevailing economic conditions the
cost of living in a place, the nature of the work to be performed and the
conditions in which the work is performed.  The contention that it was
impermissible for the Government to divide the State into several zones is
opposed to <a href="/doc/732437/" id="a_13">Section 3(3)</a> as well as to the scheme of the Act."
</p>
<p id="p_50">There is force in the contention of learned counsel for the respondents that the
principles of "zoning" will not apply to the instant case.  In this connection,
a reference may be made to <a href="/doc/915306/" id="a_14">Section 3</a> of the Act which reads as follows"
"3. Fixing of minimum rates of wages - (1) The appropriate Government shall, in
the manner thereinafter provided, -
</p><p id="p_51">(a) fix the minimum rates of wages payable to employees employed in an
employment specified in Part I or Part II of the Schedule and in an employment
added to either part by notification under <a href="/doc/965976/" id="a_15">Section 27</a>:
Provided that the appropriate Government may, in respect of employees employed
in an employment specified in Part II of the Schedule, instead of fixing minimum
rates of wages under this clause for the whole State fix such rates for a part
of the State, or for any specified class or classes of such employment in the
whole State or part thereof....
</p><p id="p_52">Provided that where for any reasons the appropriate Government has not reviewed
the minimum rates of wages fixed by it in respect of any scheduled employment
within any interval of five years, nothing contained in this clause shall be
deemed to prevent it from reviewing the minimum rates after the expiry of the
said period of five years and revising them, if necessary, and until they are so
revised the minimum rates in force immediately before the expiry of the said
period of five years shall continue in force...
</p><p id="p_53">(3) in fixing or revising the minimum rates of wages under this Section -
</p><p id="p_54">(a) different minimum rates of wages may be fixed for -
</p><p id="p_55">(i) different scheduled employments;
</p><p id="p_56">(ii)different classes of work in the same scheduled employment;
</p><p id="p_57">(iii) adults, adolescents, children and apprentices;
</p><p id="p_58">(iv) different localities;
</p><p id="p_59">(b) minimum rates of wages may be fixed by any one or more of the following wage
periods, namely:
</p><p id="p_60">(i) by the hour;
</p><p id="p_61">(ii) by the day;
</p><p id="p_62">(iii) by the month; or
</p><p id="p_63">(iv) by such other large wage period as may be prescribed;
and where such rates are fixed by the day or by the month, the manner of
calculating wages for a month or for a day, as the case may be indicated:
provided that where any wage periods have been fixed under <a href="/doc/915487/" id="a_16">Section 4</a> of the
Payment of Wages Act, 1936(4 of 1936), minimum wages shall be fixed in
accordance  therewith."
</p>
<p id="p_64">Para 24: "It is clear that <a href="/doc/732437/" id="a_17">Section 3(3)</a> of the Act specified different
classification for fixing or revising minimum rates of wages under the Section.
In the instant case, the appropriate Government has chosen in revising minimum
rates of wages to beedi workers under category given in <a href="/doc/1467448/" id="a_18">Section 3(3)(a)(i)</a> of
the Act, viz., "different scheduled employment" and not <a href="/doc/1467448/" id="a_19">Section 3(3)(a)(i)</a> of
the Act, there is no force in the contention of learned counsel for the
petitioner that the principle of "zoning" has not been applied by the first
respondent before revising the minimum wages of the beedi industry.  Thus, while
fixing the minimum wages for the employees, it is not necessary that the
criteria of region basis alone should be adhered to as the minimum wages depend
on the prevailing economic conditions, the cost of living in a place , and other
factors.  I am, therefore, of the opinion that the impugned notification cannot
be said to suffer from infirmity on the ground that the principle of region or
zonal has not been applied while fixing minimum wages for the employees engaged
in beedi making industry.  Accordingly, I reject the contentions of learned
counsel for the petitioners."
</p>
<p id="p_65">	21. A perusal of the original file clearly shows that the report of the
Advisory Committee  signed by all the representatives before the chairman of the
Advisory Committee (Deputy Commissioner of Labour), Tirunelveli and it was dated
29.8.2002.  It was the finding of the Advisory Committee that in the Ring
Labelling mostly women are employed and therefore, fixation of minimum wage was
done.  It was observed that for every day for a period of 8 hours, 8000 to 10000
beedies ring label can be affixed.  If rates are not fixed, the workers will
suffer.
</p>
<p id="p_66">	22. In fact, the committee recorded the statement  of one member, who had
stated that for affixing ring label for 1000 beedies, Rs.4.50 was paid in many
industries in the Southern District themselves.  This fact was confirmed during
committee's visit to Tirunelveli.  The  employers' representative, A.Mohammed
Shariff told the committee that in an another place Rs.3.00 was given for
pasting ring labels and they are having negotiations with the Union.  In some
place, a settlement was reached with an agreement to pay to Rs.4.00 per thousand
beedies.
</p><p id="p_67">	23.  In view of this, the Committee unanimously agreed that only some
managements were continued and in the light of the findings recorded, the
committee recommended Rs.5.00/- for pasting ring label for 1000 beedies and the
management should supply both the gum and the thread for doing the same.  Not
stopping with the same, the committee also expressed pasting of ring label of
10,000 beedies per day.  However, the trade union should be aggrieved paid on
this issue.  It is not as if the committee did not have any material.   The
members of the committee had recommended a separate payment for ring labelling.
The representation allegedly given by South Tamil Nadu Beedi Manufacturers
Association to the Committee to affix ring label is a different story.
Obviously, it did not find favour with the committee.
</p>
<p id="p_68">	24.  In fact, it is seen from the original notification in the schedule
contained an entry that it relates to beedi making other than beedi rolling.
This notification comprehensively includes ring labelling and other types of
labelling.
</p>
<p id="p_69">	25. An affidavit was filed on behalf of the impleaded respondents in
W.P.(MD)No.5663 of 2005 denying the allegations made by the management.  It is
stated that the mention of G.O. on the date of report of the committee as on
30.9.1999 was only clerical mistake and the report of the committee was dated
29.8.2005.  No importance can be given on the mistake found in the Government
Order.
</p>
<p id="p_70">	26.  An objection was raised that none of the beneficiaries of the minimum
wages notification were made parties to the Writ Petition and on the ground of
non-joinder of parties, the Writ Petition is liable to be rejected.
</p>
<p id="p_71">	27. In this context, the learned counsel relied on the judgment of this
Court in Muruga Home Industries Vs. Government of Tamil Nadu and another [1996
(1) LLJ 598].  In the said judgment similar objections raised by the workman in
paragraph 2, which is as follows:
</p><p id="p_72">	"<a href="/doc/28742/" id="a_20">Section 2</a>. Learned counsel for the respective writ petitioners submitted
their contentions, on the interpretation of <a href="/doc/1658811/" id="a_21">section 5(1)(b)</a> and sub-section (2)
of <a href="/doc/1299491/" id="a_22">Section 5</a> of the Minimum Wages Act, 1948 (hereinafter referred to as "the
Act").  On the other hand, Mr.K.Chandru, learned counsel for the impleaded
parties in writ petitions Nos.7923 and 7925 of 1993 had raised preliminary
objections regarding the maintainability of the writ petitions on the ground
that the respective workers or their unions have not been impleaded as parties
to the proceedings.  In all other writ petitions, there is no representation on
behalf of the employees or their unions from the respective beedi industries
and, therefore, he submitted that the writ petitions ought to be dismissed as
not maintainable by this Court on the preliminary ground itself."
</p>

<p id="p_73">	28. In paragraph 29, the said objection was sustained by the Court, this
reads as follows:
</p><p id="p_74">	"29. With regard to preliminary objections taken by the respondents that
the petitioners have not impleaded the necessary parties and therefore, the writ
petitions are liable to be dismissed in limine, there is force in the said
contention in view of the Supreme Court ruling in <a href="/doc/511868/" id="a_23">Prabhodh Verma v. State of
Uttar Pradesh</a> (supra) referred to above, and the judgment o the Division Bench
of this Court in <a href="/doc/1812638/" id="a_24">T.R.Sukumaran v. State of Tamil Nadu</a> (supra).  The ruling cited
by learned counsel for the petitioner in <a href="/doc/311809/" id="a_25">State of H.P. v. Kailash Chand
Maharajan (Surpa</a>), is not applicable to the facts and circumstances of the case.
On this ground also, the writ petitions are liable to be dismissed.  However,
since the writ petitions have been decided on the merits, the other writ
petitions are also accordingly dismissed."
</p>
<p id="p_75">	29. In the light of the above, all the writ petitions are  liable to be
rejected.  Since elaborate arguments were advanced and the petitioner
managements have been consistently challenging  one notification or the other
all these years, this Court undertook to go into merits of the contentions.
</p>
<p id="p_76">	30. In respect of the workers at Chennai and Vellore, a settlement under
<a href="/doc/1582225/" id="a_26">Section 12(3)</a> dated 25.6.2002 was entered into before the Deputy Commissioner of
Labour and it has been implemented in other areas also whereas the workers in
the Southern Districts were not getting the entire benefit of the minimum wage
notification.  Only fair wages are paid to them by the writ petitioners.
</p>
<p id="p_77">	31. It was alleged by the respondents that the activities of labelling and
ring labelling is found in the notification and activities relating to beedi
making other than beedi rolling.  When the committee itself unanimously accepted
a separate payment for ring labelling, it is not open to the petitioners to
challenge the notification on the ground that the procedure contemplated under
the <a href="/doc/142278/" id="a_27">Minimum Wages Act</a> was not followed.
</p><p id="p_78">	32. Appointments of committee are only made in terms of Section 5(1)A and
only the Government is able to consider the report of the committee and they are
not bound by the report of the committee.
</p><p id="p_79">	33. In the present case, by the impugned order, the Government had agreed
with the report of the committee apart from fixation of wages, also not
recommended minimum norms of l0,000 labelling per month as it is not humanely
possible.  Even as per the committee's report, beedi workers can even label only
around 8000 beedis per day.  The committee had taken into account the interest
of all concerned and had fixed the minimum wage for ring labelling.  It is not
as if the said activity is not found in the very industry itself.
</p><p id="p_80">	34. On the contrary, the committee's finding is that such payments are
prevailing in the Beedi Industry and payments varied from place to place.  The
committee took note of such payments and had come to the conclusion that as
thousands of women are employed in the Southern Districts and it  was necessary
that this work requires special attention, the minimum wages are separately
fixed. The contentions raised by the employers in this regard are unsustainable
and devoid of merits and contrary to the materials available on record.
</p><p id="p_81">	35. In view of the above, all the Writ Petitions will stand dismissed.
Parties will be allowed to bear their own costs.  Connected Miscellaneous
Petitions are closed.
