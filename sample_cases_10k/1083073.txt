                      ------------------------------------
                     Crl.M.C. No.4611 of 2008
                     -------------------------------------
            Dated this the 28th day of November, 2008

                                  ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">     Petitioner faces indictment in a prosecution for the offence

punishable under <a href="/doc/1119707/" id="a_1">Section 395</a> I.P.C. Investigation is complete.

Final report has already been filed.                  The petitioner was not

available for trial. The case against him has been split up and

has been transferred to the list of Long Pending Cases.

Reckoning the petitioner as an absconding accused, coercive

processes have been issued against the petitioner by the learned

Sessions Judge. The petitioner apprehends imminent arrest.

</p><p id="p_2">     2.    According to the petitioner, he is absolutely innocent.

He is willing to surrender before the Investigating Officer or the

learned Sessions Judge and seek regular bail.                        But he

apprehends that his application for regular bail may not be

considered by the learned Sessions Judge on merits, in

accordance with law and expeditiously. It is therefore prayed

that appropriate directions may be issued to the learned

Sessions Judge to consider his bail application expeditiously in

the light of the decision in Alice George v. The Deputy

Superintendent of Police [2003(1) KLT 339].

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">Crl.M.C. No.4611 of 2008         2</span>

</p><p id="p_3">      3.   Sufficient general directions have already been issued

in Alice George v. The Deputy Superintendent of Police

[2003(1) KLT 339] to oblige the subordinate courts to consider

applications for bail filed by accused who surrender before the

courts below as expeditiously as possible. No special or specific

direction appears to be necessary in the facts and circumstances

of this case. I have no reason to assume that the same shall not

be done.    Every court must do the same.        If there be non

compliance, the avenues of challenge/complaint are available for

the petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_4">      4.   Of course there is a contention that the prosecution is

liable to be quashed. But at the stage of arguments, only the

formal contention is urged.
</p>
<p id="p_5">      5.   Finally the counsel makes an interesting request that

the case may be directed to be disposed of expeditiously. I said

interesting because the matter has been waiting for the

appearance of the petitioner who has not made himself available.

Be that as it may, if the petitioner makes an appropriate request

to expeditiously dispose of the case before the learned Sessions

Judge, the request must be appropriately considered by the

learned Sessions Judge.

</p><p id="p_7">     6.    This Crl.M.C is, in these circumstances, dismissed, but

with the above specific observations.
</p>
<p id="p_8">     7.    Hand over a copy of this order to the learned counsel

for the petitioner for production before the court below.
