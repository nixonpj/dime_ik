<p id="p_1">          The revision petitioner herein challenges the

conviction and sentence against him under Section 55(a) of

the Kerala Abkari Act (hereinafter referred to as "the Act")

in S.C.No. 62 of 1998 of the learned Assistant Sessions

Judge, Kasaragod. Challenging the conviction and sentence,

he approached the Court of Session, Kasaragod, with

Crl.A.No. 148 of 1999.          In appeal, the learned Additional

Sessions   Judge     (Adhoc-II),        Kasaragod,           confirmed the

conviction, byt modified and reduced the jail sentence to

rigorous imprisonment for two years. Now he is before this

Court in revision challenging the conviction and sentence on

the ground of serious illegalities.
</p>
<p id="p_2">          2.    On a perusal of the materials, and on hearing

both sides, I find that the revision petitioner is entitled for

acquittal on two very important legal grounds.                     I am not

Crl.R.P. No. 1237 of 2003

inclined to go to the factual aspects in such a situation.

</p><p id="p_3">            3.    Of course, the detection in this case was

made by a Circle Inspector of the concerned Circle.          But

investigation was done by an Assistant Sub inspector of

Police, and the very same Assistant Sub Inspector submitted

final report in court.    The legal position is covered by a

Division Bench of this Court in <a href="/doc/1333455/" id="a_1">Subhash v. State of Kerala</a>

(2008 (2) KHC 703) = (2008 (2) KLT 1047). That is a case

where an Assistant Sub Inspector submitted final report

under the Kerala Abkari Act. The State contended that as

per a notification issued by the Government, Assistant Sub

Inspectors of Police are authorised to discharge the

functions of Sub Inspectors. It is well settled that the various

offences under the Kerala Abkari Act can be discharged only

by the officers specifically authorised and appointed as

Abkari Officers by the Government under Section 4 of the

Act.     In 1967, the Government issued notification as

S.R.O.No. 234/1967 by which, different powers were

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                               -3-</span>



conferred on different categories of Excise Officials. Only in

1976, the government issued a notification authorising

Police officers of and above the rank of Sub Inspectors to

discharge the functions under the Act. The Division Bench

held that such a notification will hold good for other

purposes, but for the purposes of the Kerala Abkari Act, and

for the discharge of functions thereunder, there must be a

specific notification by the Government under Section 4 of

the Act, specifically authorising the Assistant Sub Inspectors

of Police also to discharge the functions under the Act. In

this case, there are two illegalities; one is that investigation

was done by an incompetent Police officer, and the other is

that the final report was also submitted by the very same

incompetent officer.      The decision of this        Court in

Subhash's case is squarely applicable to this case, and I

find that on the ground of these two illegalities, the accused

is entitled for acquittal.

            In the result, this revision petition is allowed. The

revision petitioner is found not guilty of the offence under

Sections 55(a) of the Act, and accordingly, he is acquitted of

the said offence in revision. The conviction and sentence

against the revision petitioner in S.C.No. 62 of 1998 of the

trial court,   confirmed in appeal by the Court of Session,

Kasaragod, in Crl.A.No. 148 of 1999, will stand set aside.
