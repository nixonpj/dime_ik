        dismissed the review application of order dated 13.08.2012 filed 

        by the appellant/respondent.
</p>
<p id="p_2">    2.        The   facts   briefly   stated   are   that   the   present   case   was 

        remanded   back   to   the   Ld.   Trial   Court   by   the   Order   dated 

        18.07.2012 passed by the Ld. ARCT, Rohini Courts, Delhi, for 

        consideration on the benefit u/s 14(2) of DRC Act.  An eviction 

        petition u/s 14(1)(a) of DRC Act was filed against the appellant 

        which was allowed vide Judgment dated 02.09.2011.  In the said 

        Judgment, appellant was given an opportunity to deposit the rent 

        u/s   15(1)   of   DRC   Act   vide   order   dated   02.09.2011.     The 

        appellant was directed to pay the rent w.e.f. July 2003 till date 

        i.e. 02.09.2011 @ Rs. 660/­ per month within one month from 

        02.09.2011.     Thereafter, vide Order dated 05.12.2011, it  was

         observed that the appellant had not paid the rent as directed and, 

        therefore, he was held to be not entitled for the benefit u/s 14(2) 

        of the DRC Act.  The order dated 05.12.2011 was set aside and 

        the   matter   was   remanded   back   to   the   Ld.   Trial   Court   for 

        consideration   on   the   point   of   benefit   u/s   14(2)   of   DRC  Act. 

        After hearing arguments, the Ld. Trial Court vide order dated 

        13.08.2012   has   been   pleased   to   pass   the   eviction   order   in 

        respect   of   the   suit   property   in   favour   of   the 

        respondent/petitioner and against the appellant/respondent and 

        thereafter,   vide   order   dated   27.11.2012   dismissed   the   review 

        application   of   order   dated   13.08.2012   filed   by   the 

        appellant/respondent.  Hence, the present appeal has been filed 

        by the appellant stating therein that the impugned orders dated 

        13.08.2012 and 27.11.2012 are bad in law and are liable to be 

        set aside as the Ld. ARC erred in overlooking the facts that the 

        appellant in her statement/details of rent, deposited the rent in 

        the Court.  The respondent accepted in her examination in chief 

        that the rent till December 2002 was deposited in the Court of 

        Sh.   V.K.   Khanna,   ARC,   Delhi,   and   thereafter,   from   January 

        2003, received two drafts of Rs. 2400/­ and Rs. 3300/­.

</p><p id="p_3">     3.        It is further stated that the Ld. Trial Court has grossly erred 

        in ignoring the true facts while deciding the facts of the case as 

        when   the   rent   for   the   month   of   July   2003   has   already   been 

        received by the respondent by way of demand draft, then no rent 

        was due for the month of July 2003.  It is further stated that the 

        Ld. Trial  Court has not calculated the rent paid by the appellant 

        by way of demand draft i.e. Exs. PW1/6 &amp; PW1/7.  It is further 

        stated that as per the settled law of land, the person can lie, but 

        the   documents   cannot   and   in   the   present   case,   the   Ld.   Trial 

        Court has not looked the documents and passed the impugned 

        order in haste.
</p>
<p id="p_4">    4.        It  is  further stated that the Ld. Trial Court  has failed to 

        appreciate that after disposing of the main petition filed by the 

        respondent, there were no arrears of rent payable for the month 

        of July 2003.
</p>
<p id="p_5">    5.        It is further stated that the Ld. ARC has failed to appreciate 

        that no order has been passed by the Ld. ARC, Rohini Courts, 

        Delhi, to deposit future rent till the disposal of the misc. petition 

        (2nd  part)   of   the   main   petition.     It   is   further   stated   that   the 

        appellant had sent the rent to the respondent which was refused

         by the respondent and thereafter, from time to time the appellant 

        deposited the same u/s 27 of the DRC Act.
</p>
<p id="p_6">    6.        It  is  further stated that the Ld. Trial Court  has failed to 

        appreciate that the appellant had sent advance rent upto March 

        2012   to   the   respondent   by   way   of   money   order   and   on   her 

        refusal, the appellant deposited the same in the Court in D.R. 

        No. 145/11 entitled "Kamlesh Srivastava vs. Laxmi Devi".

</p><p id="p_7">    7.        It   is   further   stated   that   as   per   settled   law,   if   the   tenant 

        complies with the order u/s 15(1) of the DRC Act and deposits 

        monthly rent without any failure or default, then the tenant is 

        entitled for the benefit u/s 14(2) of the D.R.C. Act and in the 

        present case, the Ld. Trial Court has totally ignored that the rent 

        for the month of July 2003 was paid to the respondent by the 

        appellant by way of demand draft and thereafter, deposited by 

        the appellant in compliance of the order u/s 15(1) of D.R.C. Act 

        during the trial and the same was withdrawn by the respondent 

        from time to time and thereafter, sent the rent in advance to the 

        respondent which was refused by the respondent and thereafter, 

        the   appellant   deposited   the   same   in   the   Court   till   December 

        2012. It is further stated that the findings of the Ld. Trial Court 



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">ARCT No. 15/12/13                                                           Page 5 of 10 </span>
         are even otherwise illegal, against the facts on the record and 

        are liable to be set aside.  Hence, the present appeal.

</p><p id="p_8">    8.        Notice of the appeal was issued to the respondent and the 

        respondent filed the reply thereby denying the contents of the 

        appeal   and   stated   that   the   appellant   is     not   entitled   for   the 

        benefits u/s 14(2) of the  DRC Act and the Ld. Trial Court has 

        rightly   passed   the order dated  13.08.2012 for  eviction of  the 

        appellant from the suit premises, as the appellant has defaulted 

        in   making   the   payment   of   rent   despite   the   order   dated 

        04.07.2005 passed by the Ld. ARC, Delhi, for depositing the 

        complete rent.  It is further stated in the reply that the appellant 

        was specifically directed to pay the rent since 01.08.2003 within 

        one   month   and   was   also   directed   to   deposit   the   future   rent 

        month by month.

<p id="p_9">    9.        It   is   further   stated   in   the   reply   that   vide   order   dated 

        02.09.2011,   Ld.   ARC   directed   the   appellant   to   make   the 

        payment of the arrears of rent @ Rs. 660/­ per month w.e.f. July 

        2003 upto date and the main petition was disposed of and the 

        Ld.   ARC   directed   to   prepare   a   separate   misc.   file   for   the 

        consideration   of   the   benefit   u/s   14(2)   of   the   DRC   Act   and

         directed the Naib Nazir to report regarding the compliance of 

        the order dated 02.09.2011 by the appellant.   However, after 

        passing   of   the   order   dated   02.09.2011,   the   appellant   did   not 

        deposit   the   rent   and   failed   to   comply   with   the   direction   to 

        deposit the rent and   accordingly, the Ld. ARC vide its order 

        dated 05.12.2011 was pleased to pass an order for eviction of 

        the appellant from the suit premises.
</p>
<p id="p_10">    10.       It is further stated in the reply that thereafter, the appellant 

        filed  an  appeal  against the order dated 05.12.2011 where the 

        appellant was declined the benefit of Sec. 14(2) of the DRC Act 

        and   the   eviction   order   was   passed   against   him   the   Ld.   RCT 

        remanded back the matter for consideration on the benefit u/s 

        14(2) of DRC vide its order dated 18.07.2012.  Thereafter, the 

        Ld. Trial Court after hearing both the parties and taking into 

        consideration  the material  on record, declined the benefit  u/s 

        14(2)   of   DRC   Act   to   the   appellant   vide   its   order   dated 

        13.08.2012   and   passed   an   eviction   order   with   regard   to   the 

        tenanted premises and the appellant was directed to hand over 

        the  vacant   possession of  the suit  premises  to the  respondent. 

        Thereafter, the appellant moved an application under Order 47

<p id="p_12">    12.       During   course   of   the   arguments,   Ld.   Counsel   for   the 

        appellant submitted that at the time of disposing of the main

        of   rent   payable   for   the   month   of   July   2003.     It   is   further 

        submitted by the Ld. Counsel for the appellant that the rent for 

        the month of July 2003 was paid to the respondent/landlady by 

        way of demand draft and thereafter, deposited by the appellant 

        in compliance of the order u/s 15(1) of D.R.C. Act during the 

        trial and withdrawn by the respondent from time to time and 

        thereafter,   the   appellant   sent   the   rent   in   advance   to   the 

        respondent which was refused by the respondent and thereafter,

        since July 2003 and notice demanding the arrears of rent was 

        served upon the appellant/tenant.  Hence, I do not find any flaw 

        or   infirmity   in   the   impugned   orders   dated   13.08.2012   and 

        27.11.2012 since the respondent has paid the rent w.e.f. August 

        2003.  The appellant has failed to comply with the orders of the 

        Ld.   Court   and   as   such,   the   appellant   is   not   entitled   for   the 

        benefit u/s 14(2) of the DRC Act.  There is no infirmity in the 

        order of the Ld. ARC dated 13.08.2012.  Similarly, I also do not 

        find any infirmity in the order dated 27.11.2012 passed by the 

        Ld. Trial Court while disposing of the review application filed 

        by the appellant in that Court.  
</p>
<p id="p_15">    14.       It has been rightly observed by the Ld. Trial Court that the 

        order   dated   13.08.2012   is   the   sequel   to   the   Judgment   dated 

        02.09.2011 wherein it was observed that the rent is to be paid 

        from July 2003 and in the statement of account, it was found 

        that   the   rent   has   not   been   paid   for   the   month   of   July   2003, 



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">ARCT No. 15/12/13                                                           Page 9 of 10 </span>
           therefore, in consonance with the Judgment dated 02.09.2011, 

          order dated 13.08.2012 was passed. The said Judgment dated 

          02.09.2011, in my opinion also, has attained the finality.

</p><p id="p_16">    15.        In view of the above discussions, I do not find any flaw or 

          infirmity   in   the   impugned   orders   dated   13.08.2012   and 

          27.11.2012 passed by the Ld. Trial Court.  Hence, I do not find 

          any reason to interfere in the findings of Ld. Trial Court.  I see 

          no substance in this appeal as nothing could be pointed out from 

          the contentions of the appellant.  
</p>
<p id="p_17">    16.        In the result, I hold that this appeal is devoid of any merits 

          and is accordingly dismissed.  However, parties are left to bear 

          their   own   costs.     Record   of   the   Trial   Court   be   sent   back 

          alongwith an attested copy of the Judgment passed today. 

          Appeal file be consigned to Record Room, after completing the 

          necessary formalities. </p><pre id="pre_2">
