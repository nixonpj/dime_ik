      THESE APPEALS ARE COMING ON FOR FINAL HEARING
THIS DAY, B.A.PATIL J., DELIVERED THE FOLLOWING:


                   JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">       These two appeals have been preferred by accused

Nos.2 and 3, being aggrieved by the judgment of

conviction and order of sentence passed by the IV

Additional District and Sessions Judge, D.K., Mangalore

in S.C.No.181/2010 dated 17/21.9.2013.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                            3</span>

</p><p id="p_2">     2.    Brief facts of the case are that one Asli Haris

filed the complaint as per Ex.P14 contending that on

14.7.2010 at about 1.15 p.m. she received a telephone

call from the railway station informing that a minor girl

from Orissa is present in the station who does not know

Kannada and is not keeping well.       Immediately, she

informed her colleagues Smt.Shyni and Smt.Jyothi to go

to the railway station and she also informed to bring the

victim to the child line centre and accordingly, they

went to Mangalore Railway Station and the C.T.T.I.

showed the girl who was in the waiting room and she

was produced before the child line centre wherein she

was enquired by Smt.Sunitha and Smt.Vidya. On their

enquiry, victim informed that she is working in the

house of one Emilda situate at Kadri Alvaris road since

April as maid servant and since she was not willing to

work there and was intending to go to her native place,

on 14.7.2010 at about 6.00 a.m. she left from the house

and came to Mangalore Railway Station and when she
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                            4</span>

was sitting on the bench in the said railway station,

after three hours, three persons came there asking her

as to where she is going and as she was not knowing

the language she replied as Orissa and thereafter, the

said three persons by forcefully holding her hands took

her to a railway compartment of the train which was

standing there and made her to lie and assaulted on her

cheeks and out of the said three persons, two persons

have sexually assaulted her and that she informed that

she can identify the said persons.   She also told that

she   became   unconscious and thereafter she       was

brought to the waiting room. Accordingly, it was

requested to take legal action against the accused

persons.   The said complaint was registered.   On the

basis of the said complaint, case was registered in

Crime No.12/2010 for the offence punishable under

<a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_2">Section 376</a> r/w <a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_3">Section 34</a> of IPC.     Thereafter, after

investigation, charge sheet was laid against the accused

persons by showing accused No.1 as absconding and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                              5</span>

the case was committed to the Sessions Court.        The

Sessions Court took cognizance of the offence and after

securing the presence of accused Nos.2 to 4 who were in

judicial custody and after hearing both sides, charge

was prepared and explained to the accused in the

language known to them. Since, they pleaded not guilty

and claimed to be tried, trial was fixed.


</p><p id="p_3">     3.    In order to prove its case, the prosecution

got examined 24 witnesses, marked 30 documents and

27 material objects. Thereafter, the statement of the

accused was recorded under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_4">Section 313</a> of Cr.P.C. by

putting the incriminating material against them.     The

accused denied the said circumstances and the answers

given by the accused were recorded against the respective

questions. Thereafter, accused No.3 submitted his written

say and the remaining accused persons have not lead any

evidence. During the course of cross-examination of the

prosecution witnesses, they got marked Exs.D1 and D2.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                             6</span>

</p><p id="p_4">       4.   The trial Court, after hearing the learned

counsel appearing for the parties and after considering the

evidence and the material placed on record, came to the

conclusion that prosecution has proved the guilt of

accused Nos.2 and 3 and convicted them for the offence

punishable under <a href="/doc/1284610/" id="a_5">Section 376(2)(g)</a> of IPC and acquitted

accused No.4 holding that there is no material as against

him.
</p>
<p id="p_5">
</p><p id="p_6">       5.   Being aggrieved by the said judgment of

conviction and order of sentence, accused Nos.2 and 3

are before this Court.
</p>
<p id="p_7">
</p><p id="p_8">       6.   Heard the learned counsel for the appellant

Sri.    Aruna    Shyam      for   accused     No.2     and

Sri. P.Karunakar, learned counsel for accused No.3 and

also Sri. Vijayakumar Majage, learned Additional State

Public Prosecutor on behalf of the State.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                             7</span>

</p><p id="p_9">     7.     It is the contention of the learned counsel for

appellant/accused No.2 that though the alleged incident

has taken place at about 6.00 am, the complaint was

came to be filed only at about 1.10 PM, till then, the

victim has not whispered anything about the sexual

assault committed on her by accused persons.           Even

the delay has also not been properly explained. He

further submitted that prior to filing of the complaint,

so many authorized officers and police have also met

with victim, then also she has not made any allegation

about     the   sexual   assault    committed     by    the

appellant/accused persons. The allegation of sexual

assault has been inserted only after the Child Line

Organization took her into their possession and lodged

the complaint. He further contended that then the

victim came to be examined by the Doctor-PW-10. At

that time the conduct of victim was normal and the

clinical examination of the victim by the doctor were

also normal. Under such circumstances, there is no
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                            8</span>

question of she being sexually assaulted by accused

persons and will not be a gang rape. He further

submitted that there is a variation of the time of the

incident and there are absolutely no materials as

against the appellant/accused No.2 and the entire order

is passed on the basis of the conjectures and surmises

which is unsustainable in law and accused No.2 has

been wrongly convicted.
</p>
<p id="p_10">
</p><p id="p_11">     8.    He further contended that the court below

has not properly appreciated the medical evidence.

Though there is absolutely no medical evidence in

support of the case of prosecution to show that victim

has been sexually assaulted on the date of alleged

incident but the trial Court has wrongly convicted the

accused No.2/appellant. He further submitted that the

accused No.4 was acquitted on the same evidence but

accused No.2 has been convicted by relying upon the

said evidence. He further submitted that though there is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                             9</span>

no worth believable evidence, the trial Court has

convicted   the   accused   No.2/appellant.     He   further

alternatively submitted that if the entire evidence and

variation is taken into consideration, then there is no

rape as alleged but it will be attracting for the lesser

offences i.e., attempt to commit rape and not actual

rape, in that light, the trial Court ought to have

convicted the accused for the lesser offence.


</p><p id="p_12">     9.     In order to substantiate his arguments

learned counsel for appellant/accused No.2 relied upon

the following decisions reported in:
</p>
<p id="p_13">     (1) (2004) 4 SCC 379 between Aman Kumar and
Another Vs. State of Haryana.
</p>
<p id="p_14">     (2) 2011 (4) SCC KAR 4229 between Anil Kuamr
and others Vs. The State of Karnataka.
</p>
<p id="p_15">      (3) 2011 (4) SCC KAR 236 between Anil Kuamr and
others Vs. The State of Karnataka.
</p>
<p id="p_16">    (4) (2011) 14 SCC 475 between K.P.Thimmappa
Gowda Vs. State of Karnataka.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                            10</span><p id="p_17">

</p><p id="p_18">     Hence, he prayed to allow the appeal by setting

aside the impugned judgment of conviction and order of

sentence passed by the court below and acquit him

from all the charges leveled against him.


</p><p id="p_19">     10.   The   learned   counsel   for    accused   No.3

vehemently argued by contending that the entire

evidence produced by the prosecution nowhere alleges

that the accused No.3 has sexually assaulted the victim.

Even the victim has also not stated anything as against

accused No.3. He further submitted that though on

similar allegations as against accused No.4, trail Court

has acquitted accused No.4 but by wrongly assessing

the evidence, accused No.3 has been convicted. He

further submitted that though test identification parade

was conducted by PW-18-Manjunath, Tahsildar by

taking the victim to the jail premises but in her evidence

she has clearly admitted the fact that she has seen

accused No.3 in the police station. Then under such
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                             11</span>

circumstances, the test identification parade which

indicates that victim has identified the accused No.3 will

not be sustainable in Law. He further submitted that

though there is no worth believable materials as against

the accused No.3, he has been convicted. He further

submitted that no substantial charge has been framed

as against accused No.3. But he has been wrongly

convicted only because that his presence was noted in

the records.
</p>
<p id="p_20">
</p><p id="p_21">     11.   In order to substantiate his arguments

learned counsel for appellant/accused No.3 relied upon

the decision reported in:
</p>
<p id="p_22">      2018 SCC Online DEL 6989 between Anil Thakur
Vs. State of NCT of Delhi.
</p>
<p id="p_23">
</p><p id="p_24">     On these grounds, he prayed for allowing the

appeal by setting aside the impugned judgment of

conviction and order of sentence passed against the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                           12</span>

accused No.3 and acquit him from the charges leveled

against him.
</p>
<p id="p_25">
</p><p id="p_26">     12.   Per contra, learned Additional State Public

Prosecutor vehemently argued by contending that, the

victim has categorically deposed before the Court below

that it is the accused Nos.1 to 3 who took her into

railway compartment and accused Nos.1 and 2 have

sexually assaulted her. The evidence of victim is worth

believable and even it is corroborated with the evidence

of Doctor-PW-14. He further submitted that the FSL

Report-Ex.P13 and the evidence of PW-20 also clearly

goes to show that the articles which have been

examined are pertaining to the accused Nos. 1 and 2

and the victim and the same have corroborated to show

that victim has been sexually assaulted. He further

contended that apart from test identification parade the

victim has seen the accused persons in the railway

station and thereafter in the railway compartment and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                              13</span>

the incident has not taken place on spur of moment but

there was sufficient time for the victim to identify the

accused persons. In that light, identification made by

the victim even before the Court is reliable and trial

Court after considering all these facts, has rightly

convicted the accused persons. He further submitted

that there were no reasons to falsely implicate the

accused persons that too when the victim is from Orissa

State and accused persons are from Mangalore and

even they were not acquainted with the victim. He

further submitted that because of the language problem

and as she has been sexually assaulted, immediately

she was not in a position to give information and to

communicate with the concerned official with regard to

the sexual assault. As such, though incident has taken

place at about 6.00 am and complaint was lodged at

about 1.15 pm, thereafter, investigation has been

started. There is no irregularity or illegality.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                           14</span>

</p><p id="p_27">     13.   He further submitted that the victim has

also identified accused Nos.2 and 3 and even, PW1 has

also identified accused Nos.2 and 3 when they were

taking the victim to the railway compartment. When the

evidence is there to show that the accused persons

including accused No.3 with a common intention have

taken the victim into railway compartment, thereafter,

she has been sexually assaulted by remaining accused

persons, under such circumstances, accused No.3 is

also liable to be convicted for the alleged offence. He

further submitted that the trial Court after considering

all the legal evidence and materials placed on record

has rightly convicted accused Nos. 2 and 3 and there

are no good grounds made out by appellant so as to

interfere with the impugned judgment and the appeals

are devoid of merits and same are liable to be

dismissed. Accordingly, learned Addl. State Public

Prosecutor prays to dismiss the appeals by confirming

the impugned judgment.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                           15</span><p id="p_28">

</p><p id="p_29">     14.   We have gone through the grounds of appeal

made out in both the appeals and even oral submission

made by the learned counsel appearing for both the

parties and impugned judgment of conviction and order

of sentence and even oral and documentary evidence.


</p><p id="p_30">     15.   It is the case of prosecution that the victim

who has come from Orissa State and was working in the

house of PW15-Smt.Emilda, has been brought by PW21

to the house of PW15 as maid servant. When she was

working in the house of PW15, she was not interested to

work with the said family. As such, on 14.07.2010 when

PW15 went to Church, the victim in order to go back to

her village left the house from PW15 and went to the

Mangalore Railway Station. When she was sitting in the

railway station platform, the accused persons noticed

her and took her into the railway compartment and

committed rape.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">                            16</span><p id="p_31">

</p><p id="p_32">     16.   In order to see whether the prosecution has

proved its case beyond all reasonable doubt, we feel, it

is just and proper to look in to the evidence of PW3-

victim girl. In her evidence she has deposed that she is

originally from Orissa State. Her parents are residing in

Orissa. She studied up to 8th standard. About one and

half year back, she came to Mangalore to the house of

Emilda for the purpose of work. She further deposed

that she has not gone back to her native place since

then. The family members of Emilda were not taking

care of her, she decided to go back to her village. At

about 5.30 am she came out from the house of Emilda

without informing her and thereafter, she straight away

went to the Mangalore railway station at about 7.30 am.

When she was sitting on the bench, two boys came

there and enquired her where she had to go. She told

that she had to go to Goa and she asked them which

train does go to Goa and they told that Goa train comes

to Platform No.3. Then, Accused 2 and 3 who are before
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                            17</span>

the Court took her to platform No.3 and there was a

train standing in the platform No.3 and there were no

passengers in that train, hence, she told them that she

wants to go back but accused persons did not leave her.

At that time accused No.4 came there and brought tea

and bread and offered the same to victim but she

refused to take tea and bread. Thereafter, accused No.3

asked her as to whether she is having money to go to

Goa otherwise police will arrest her. She further

deposed that she has money. At that time, accused Nos.

2 and 3 took her into the railway compartment and

closed windows and doors of the railway compartment.

Thereafter, all the three accused persons made her to lie

on the seat, accused Nos. 3 and 4 caught hold her legs

and accused No.2 sexually assaulted her, then, she lost

consciousness. Thereafter, accused No.3 sprinkled some

water on her face, then she regained her conscious. She

further deposed that thereafter, accused No.1 sexually

assaulted her who is not present before the Court and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">                            18</span>

he is absconding. She further deposed that after

sometime, a women came there to clean compartment,

at that time accused persons fled away from the spot.

Then, she asked that women to give some water. She

gave water to her and took her to waiting room and

there she has not informed about the sexual assault.

Thereafter, one more lady came and gave her tea and

biscuits. After some time two ladies came and took her

to their office and victim girl informed them about the

incident. Then police took her to hospital for treatment,

and   thereafter   she   has    been   taken   to   Women

Rehabilitation Centre. She further deposed that on

16.07.2010, they took her to police station and she

identified accused No.3. After one week, she has been

taken to Mangalore jail premises and there she was

asked to identify the accused persons who were

standing in the line with other persons and she

identified all the three accused persons.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">                              19</span>

</p><p id="p_33">     17.     During the course of cross examination of

this witness, it has been elicited that her date of birth

has been entered in the office register and prior to the

alleged    incident   she   was not   having any sexual

intercourse with anybody. It has been further elicited

that she has informed about the sexual assault before

the railway police and they have obtained her signature.

It has been further elicited that sexual assault taken

place at about 7.30 am. It has been further elicited that

she made alarm, weep and cry when accused persons

took her by holding her hands and at that time nobody

was present there and she did not notice whether

canteen or other shops were opened or not. It has been

further elicited that she fell down when accused persons

were taking her by holding her hands and thereafter,

they dragged her in to the railway compartment. Both

the accused persons have sexually assaulted her once

and she lost her consciousness. She regained her

consciousness when a lady came and sprinkled water
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">                           20</span>

on her face. After she regained her consciousness, she

covered her dress. She also identified the accused

persons who are before the Court. Except these things

nothing has been elicited during the course of cross

examination so as to discard her evidence.


</p><p id="p_34">     18.   Though it is the contention of the learned

counsel for accused No.2 that when victim girl was

taken inside the railway compartment by accused Nos.

2 and 3, she has not made any alarm or she did not

weep and cry and even she has not informed to anybody

who were all present at the spot. But as could be seen

from the evidence of PW3, it clearly goes to show that

when accused Nos. 2 and 3 took her by holding her

hands, she made alarm, despite alarm, they took her

into the railway compartment. Merely because no other

persons came to rescue the victim when she made hue

and cry, it does not mean that alleged incident has not

taken place. Admittedly alleged incident has taken place
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">                            21</span>

at about 7.30 am only if train comes there then only

there will be people. In this behalf no material has been

placed to show that people were there. When victim

herself specifically deposed that it is accused Nos. 2 and

3 who made enquiry and thereafter under the guise of

taking her to proper train and took her to railway

compartment and when she tried to come out, no

person were present. Under such circumstances they

forcibly took her inside the compartment and accused

Nos.1 and 2 sexually assaulted her. When the victim

herself has identified accused Nos. 1 and 2 as the -

person who sexually assaulted her. The same appears

to be worth believable. No women or girl will come

forward and expose herself that she has been sexually

assaulted. If she is falsely implicating accused Nos. 1

and 2, she should have even stated that accused Nos. 3

and 4 have also sexually assaulted her. In that light the

evidence of victim appears to be truthful and reliable.

There is worth believable evidence of victim herself and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">                            22</span>

then the same can be relied upon and it can be held

that prosecution has proved the guilt of the accused

beyond all reasonable doubt in accordance with law.


</p><p id="p_35">     19.   Even though, it is the contention of the

learned counsel for the appellant that test identification

parade which has been conducted by following the

procedure as established by law by PW18-Tahsildar is

there in the evidence but by drawing out our attention

to the evidence of PW3, he further submitted that before

holding the test identification parade and the giving the

report as per Ex.P11 and P12, the victim has been

shown accused persons. But as could be seen from the

evidence of PW3-victim therein she has specifically

deposed that she has only seen accused No.3 and no

where she has deposed that accused No.2 was also

present when she saw accused No.3. Then under such

circumstances, the contention of the learned counsel for

accused No.2 that test identification parade is after
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">                           23</span>

showing the accused persons in the police station does

not hold any water. As could be seen from the evidence

of PW18, therein he has specifically deposed that on

21.07.2010 at about 4.30 pm there was a test

identification parade and there, he has also made

arrangements by calling accused No.2 as well as

remaining eight accused persons who were all similar in

age and similarly built up with body. Then he sent jail

authorities out side.
</p>
<p id="p_36">
</p><p id="p_37">     20.   Thereafter, he called accused No.2 and he

made him to stand along with other accused. He

recorded their names. Thereafter, called the victim and

asked her whether police have shown photos of

accused. She told no. Then, he asked victim to identify

the assailant who sexually assaulted her. She identified

the person who stood at Sl.No.8. Thereafter he sent

victim out of that place. Then, rearranged the persons

by changing their shirts, again he called the victim to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">                              24</span>

identify the accused who sexually assaulted her. She

identified the person who was standing at 6th in the line.

This evidence of PW18 has not been destroyed during

the course of cross examination.
</p>
<p id="p_38">
</p><p id="p_39">     21.     Even evidence of PW18 shows that similar

type of exercise was made in respect of accused No.3.

During the course of cross examination even there is no

suggestion to the effect that said accused has been

shown to the victim in the police station earlier to the

test identification parade. There is no evidence that

victim has not identified accused persons in the test

identification parade. Under such circumstances, the

contention    of   accused    persons   that    the   test

identification parade is not in accordance with law is

also not sustainable in law and it is not having any

force. It is further contention of the learned counsel for

appellants that immediately after the first incident,

victim herself has specifically deposed as she became
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">                              25</span>

unconscious and she regained her conscious only after

accused No.3 sprinkled some water on her face, by that

time already sexual assault has been committed on her.

As could be seen from the evidence of PW3, it is clearly

goes to show that accused Nos.2 and 3 have taken her

into railway compartment. She further deposed that

those two closed the windows and all the three accused

made her to sleep on the sheet and accused No.2 slept

on her and sexually assaulted her at that time accused

No.3 and accused No.4 were holding her upper lower

limbs.   At   that   time   she   lost   her   consciousness.

Thereafter accused No.3 sprinkled water. She regained

the consciousness. Thereafter, it is the accused No.1

sexually assaulted her who is not present before the

Court. There is a concrete evidence of victim to testify

the fact that there has been sexual assault. Under such

circumstances, the contention of appellant in this behalf

is also not acceptable in law. It is the contention of the

learned counsel for appellant that there is absolutely no
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">                           26</span>

medical evidence in support of the prosecution case. As

could be seen from the evidence of victim she has

specifically deposed before the court that accused Nos.

1 and 2 have sexually assaulted her and prior to that

she has no sex.
</p>
<p id="p_40">
</p><p id="p_41">     22.   If we peruse the evidence of PW12-Dr.

Sundari, she has deposed that she has examined victim

on 14.07.2010 at about 8.45 PM who has come with the

history of sexual assault on 14.07.2010 at about 10.00

am at Mangalore Railway Station. In her evidence she

has deposed that, she examined pelvic and there she

has noticed that hymen absent. Vagina easily admits

two fingers. P/S: White Discharge present. Servics and

Vagina Normal. P/V: Servics healthy. Uterus was

normal. She has also given her opinion that clinical

evidence suggests that sexual intercourse occurred and

FSL examination evidence suggests, no evidence of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">                               27</span>

recent sexual activity. She has issued a certificate Ex.P8

and Ex.P8a is her signature.
</p>
<p id="p_42">
</p><p id="p_43">      23.   Though        during   the    course   of   cross

examination, it has been brought on record that girl

might have earlier sexual intercourse on account of

which hymen was absent and vagina admits two fingers

easily. Swelling and tenderness of labia minora will

indicate recent activity. In case of the forcibly sexual

intercourse there will be redness of labia minora.

Similarly in case of forcible sexual intercourse there will

be bruises and inceration external genitals present with

redness swelling and inflammation. If there is forcible

intercourse there will be tears of vaginal wall or

parinalody. If there is forcible intercourse, there will be

chance of tear of posterior fornics. She further admitted

the   suggestion     as     true   that   the   presence   of

spermatozova is the proof for sexual intercourse. The

presence of seminal stains on the clothes of the victim
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">                            28</span>

or on the body of the victim is positive evidence

regarding proof of sexual intercourse. Seminal fluid

deposits on the vagina if ejaculation inside the vagina.


</p><p id="p_44">     24.   Though this is the evidence of PW-12-Doctor

but if we take the evidence of PW3-victim, in her

evidence it has been elicited in para-8 of her cross

examination that prior to the alleged incident she was

not having sexual act. The said evidence clearly

indicates the fact that she was not having any sexual

activity prior to the alleged incident.   The evidence of

PW12 clearly goes to show that sexual intercourse has

occurred. The said evidence corroborates with evidence

of victim and clearly goes to show that victim has been

sexually assaulted.
</p>
<p id="p_45">
</p><p id="p_46">     25.   Be that as it may, even it is well established

principle of law that victim herself come before the

Court and has specifically deposed that it is accused

Nos.1 and 2 who have sexually assaulted and even
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">                            29</span>

nothing has been elicited during the course of cross

examination why accused persons falsely implicated in

this case.
</p>
<p id="p_47">
</p><p id="p_48">     26.     Under such circumstances, we are of the

considered opinion that even conviction can be based on

sole testimony of prosecutrix. The main evidence in all

such cases is that of victim herself only thing which the

Court has to see is only credibility of such evidence. If

her evidence is credible other evidence is being merely

corroborative. It is not necessary that there should be

independent      corroboration    of    every    material

circumstances in that light if we peruse the entire

evidence of the prosecution though, there is some

variation of medical evidence in this behalf when we

peruse the evidence of PW3, we found it to be worth of

credence and reliable and that there are no good

grounds to reject the evidence of victim. It has been held

by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Mohd. Imran
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_28">                            30</span>

Khan Vs. State Government (NCT of Delhi) reported in

(2011) 10 Sec. 192 wherein at paragraphs 22 to 24, it

has been observed as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">            22. It is a trite law that a woman,
      who is the victim of sexual assault, is not
      an accomplice to the crime but is a victim
      of another person's lust. The prosecutrix
      stands at a higher pedestal than an
      injured witness as she suffers from
      emotional injury. Therefore, her evidence
      need not be tested with the same amount
      of suspicion as that of an accomplice. <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_6">The
      Evidence Act</a>, 1872 (hereinafter called "the
      <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_7">Evidence Act</a>") nowhere says that her
      evidence cannot be accepted unless it is
      corroborated in material particulars. She
      is undoubtedly a competent witness under
      Sec. 118 of the <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_8">Evidence Act</a> and her
      evidence must receive the same weight as
      is attached to an injured in case of
      physical violence. The same degree of care
      of an injured complainant or witness and
      no more. If the court keeps this in mind
      and feels satisfied that it can act on the
      evidence of the prosecutrix, there is no
      rule of law or practice incorporated in the
      <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_9">Evidence Act</a> similar to Illustration (b) to
      <a href="/doc/731516/" id="a_10">section 114</a> which requires it to look for
      corroboration. If for some reason the court
      is hesitant to place implicit reliance on the
      testimony of the prosecutrix it may look
      for evidence which may lend assurance to
      her testimony short of corroboration
      required in the case of an accomplice. If
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_29">                      31</span>

the totality of the circumstances appearing
on the record of the case disclose that the
prosecutrix does not have a strong motive
to falsely involve the person charged, the
court should ordinarily have no hesitation
in accepting her evidence.</blockquote><p id="p_49">

</p><p id="p_50">      23. The court must be alive to its
responsibility and the sensitive while
dealing with cases involving sexual
molestations. Rape is not merely a
physical assault, rather it often distracts
the whole personality of the victim. The
rapist degrades the very soul of the
helpless female and, therefore, the
testimony of the prosecutrix must be
appreciated in the background of the
entire case and in such cases, non-
</p><p id="p_51">examination even of other witnesses may
not be a serious infirmity in the
prosecution case, particularly where the
witnesses had not seen the commission of
the offence. (vide State of Maharastra Vs.
Chandraprakash Kewalchand Jain, State
of U.P. Vs. Pappu and Vijay Vs. State of
M.P.)

</p><p id="p_52">      24. Thus, the law that emerges on
the issue is to the effect that statement of
the prosecutrix, if found to be worthy of
credence and reliable, requires no
corroboration. That court may convict the
accused on the sole testimony of the
prosecutrix.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_30">                              32</span><p id="p_53">

</p><p id="p_54">       27.   When we    perused the entire evidence on

record, it clearly goes to show that the victim is from

Orissa and accused persons are from Mangalore and

they have seen her in the platform of railway station of

Mangalore and at that time only she come in contact

with the accused persons. Under such circumstances,

false implication of the accused persons by the victim

and identifying them with specific identification before

the Court as well as in test identification parade will not

make    to   discard   the   evidence   of   victim.   While

appreciating the evidence of prosecutrix background of

entire case has to be kept in to consideration and its

totality of the circumstances discloses that prosecutrix

does not have a strong motive to falsely implicate the

accused. Under such circumstances, Court should not

hesitate to convict the accused. Even during the course

of cross examination no such suggestion has been made

why accused No.2 has been falsely implicated in this
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_31">                           33</span>

case. In that light also evidence of PW3 is trust worth

and reliable.
</p>
<p id="p_55">
</p><p id="p_56">     28.   Even the evidence produced clearly goes to

show that accused Nos.2 and 3 first spoken to the

victim when she was sitting on bench in the platform

and they made enquiry about her and took her to

platform No.3 where train was standing. Thereafter,

accused persons took her inside the standing train and

there sexually assaulted her forcibly. When there is a

long gap in the conversation between the accused

persons and victim and she has specifically identified

the persons who are present before the Court. Under

such circumstances, and that too alleged incident has

taken place during broad light. Then her evidence can

be believed. Even the evidence of victim corroborates

with the complaint which has been given as per Ex.P14

which is filed by one Asli Haris, General Secretary,

YMCA. Though the said person is no more. Prosecution
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_32">                            34</span>

has established the said fact and the witness has

identified the signature of the deceased Asli Haris as

Ex.P.14. In this behalf also there is corroboration in the

evidence of prosecution with that of the victim.


</p><p id="p_57">     29. Be that as it may, when we have carefully

perused the evidence of PW20- Forensic Expert in her

evidence, she has deposed that she has received 20

seized articles on 02.08.2010 and she has given serial

numbers to such articles and thereafter she has tested

the articles. In Article Nos.A1A, A2, E2 and E5 she

found stains of blood and she could not conduct

serology test as there is no sufficient blood stain in the

sample of A1A, A2 and E2. The evidence clearly goes to

show that stains of blood showed on A1A, A2 were on

the clothes belonging to the accused No.2 and E2 and

E5   are   belonged   to   the   victim.   This    evidence

corroborates to the evidence of victim to the effect that

there was little bleeding when she          was sexually
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_33">                             35</span>

assaulted and when they bite her. Even accused has

not given his explanation as to how, where and when

his clothes were stained with blood.    In that light, an

adverse inference can be drawn as against Accused

No.2.
</p>
<p id="p_58">
</p><p id="p_59">        30.   In that light, there is material as against

accused Nos.1 and 2 and it shows that victim was

sexually assaulted by accused No.2 and accused No.1.

Though it is the contention of the learned counsel for

the appellant/accused that there are contradiction and

omission and variation of the time with regard to the

alleged incident and even there is no consistency in the

evidence of PW3 with regard to the sexual assault on

her and she was not knowing the local language and

other persons who are present in the railway station.

Under such circumstances, minor discrepancies are

bound to happen in this behalf that too when she has

been sexually assaulted. When we peruse the said
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_34">                           36</span>

contradiction and omission, they will not take away the

case of prosecution. In that light the contention of

learned counsel for the appellant/accused No.2 does

not appears to be acceptable. Only on that ground we

cannot hold that there is no such sexual assault by

accused No.2 on the victim.       The prosecution has

proved the guilt of the accused beyond all reasonable

doubt.
</p>
<p id="p_60">
</p><p id="p_61">     31.   In so far as, the evidence of the prosecution,

we found that though accused No.3 has been charged

for common intention, but if we go through the conduct

of accused No.3 with reference to the evidence of PW3-

victim, accused No.3 took the victim forcibly inside the

railway compartment by holding her hand. After sexual

assault on victim, she was unconscious, then, accused

No.3 sprinkled water on her face made her to regain her

conscious. In order to bring home the guilt of the

accused Nos.3 and 4 there must be prior meeting of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_35">                            37</span>

mind to execute the said act. In this behalf prosecution

has not produced any material. Even there is no

evidence to show that accused No.3 also sexually

assaulted her. Even as could be seen from the evidence

of PW3 at the time of test identification parade which

has been conducted in this behalf, victim specifically

stated that before taking her to jail premises for test

identification parade, they have shown accused No.3 in

the police station. Keeping in view the said facts and

circumstances, there is no consistent evidence in sofar

as accused No.3 is concerned. As such, evidence as

against    the   accused   No.3   neither   reliable   nor

acceptable. As such, there is no concrete corroboration

in the evidence so as to convict the accused No.3 to the

alleged crime.
</p>
<p id="p_62">
</p><p id="p_63">     32.    In order to prove the common intention, the

prosecution has to prove that the crime which has been

committed by several persons or two or more persons
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_36">                             38</span>

and there was a common intention and pre-arranged

plan to commit an offence and thereafter that there

must be participation in reaching the said common

intention but when we perused the evidence which has

been produced before the court below though the

prosecution has proved the presence of accused No.3 at

the alleged place of incident but the second ingredients

of the said section i.e., that there was a common

intention or pre-meditated mind and it was pre-

planned, that evidence is lacking. In that light, the court

below has not properly looked in to this aspect of the

matter and by holding that accused No.3 was also

having common intention has wrongly convicted the

accused.
</p>
<p id="p_64">
</p><p id="p_65">     33.   Even we have noticed that when accused

No.4 was also standing on the same footing in similar

line on the basis of said evidence, trial Court has

acquitted accused No.4. Under such circumstances, we
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_37">                               39</span>

feel that accused No.3 is also entitled to some benefit

set aside. Accordingly, it is set aside and we proceed to
