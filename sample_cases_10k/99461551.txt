<p id="p_1">              Through this petition under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_1">Article 227</a> of the Constitution of India,

petitioner has laid challenge to order dated 25.01.2018(Annexure P-5) of the trial

Court, whereby his application for permitting him to lead additional evidence has

been dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_2">              In nutshell, respondent No.1-plaintiff, claiming himself to be owner

of the suit land filed a suit for possession against the petitioner and one Ajay son

of Meena (proforma respondent No.2).
</p>
<p id="p_3">              After holding trial, the learned trial court dismissed the suit vide

judgment and decree dated 24.02.2015 (Annexure P-1).

</p><p id="p_4">              Being aggrieved, respondent No.1-plaintiff approached the First

Appellate Court, which, after hearing both the sides, remanded the case back,

setting aside judgment and decree aforesaid for its decision afresh after getting

the suit land demarcated in accordance with standing order No.2/relevant rules of

the Financial Commissioner.
</p>
<p id="p_5">              After remand, the petitioner moved application for leading additional

evidence on the ground that he has purchased small portion of the suit land

measuring 2 marlas during pendency of the suit from one co-sharer Narender

Singh and thus, he had become co-sharer in the suit land.

</p><p id="p_6">             Learned trial Court, after hearing both the sides, dismissed the

application vide impugned order (Annexure P-5), relevant portion of which reads

as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">                "It is the case of the applicant/defendant that the
                documents are relevant, on the ground that now
                applicant had become co-sharer/co-owner in the
                suit property. So, want to produce the sale deed,
                jamabandi mutation in additional evidence. For the
                sake of arguments/discussion if a private individual
                purchases a joint property, from one of the co-
                sharer, then the subsequent purchaser do not
                become a co-sharer with the same right of his
                vendor and being subsequent purchaser had only
                right/remedy to file suit for partition of the joint
                holding out of which purchased share. Further out
                of the joint property one of the co-sharer who had
                sold part of suit property, cannot transfer
                possession of any part of the joint holding unless he
                was having exclusive possession over the part
                transferred and the said exclusive possession was
                also incorporated in the revenue records. In the
                case in hand no such facts has been found. As per
                directions of learned Appellate Court case was
                remanded back with the observations that suit land
                be demarcated afresh as per the guidelines of the
                Financial Commissioner relevant Rules and decide
                the matter thereupon afresh. Keeping in view the
                discussion above, application under consideration is
                hereby dismissed being devoid of merits."</blockquote><p id="p_7">

that since the petitioner has become a co-sharer in the suit land, therefore, he may

be permitted to lead additional evidence for proving the sale deed in his favour.

The submission so made by learned counsel for the petitioner has already been

dealt with by learned trial Court, therefore, the same needs not be gone into again,

more particularly, when the impugned order is perfectly legal.

infirmity in the above findings of the trial Court.

</p><p id="p_10">             In view of discussion made above, the petition fails and is dismissed.
