03/14.07.2015</pre><p id="p_1">         The three petitioners namely Anish Lakra @ Sunil Oraon, Hemant
                Lakra @ Simon Oraon and Anil Lakra have moved this Court under <a href="/doc/1475229/" id="a_1">Section
                53</a> of the Juvenile Justice (Care &amp; <a href="/doc/1973522/" id="a_2">Protection of Children) Act</a>, 2000 (in short
                "the Act") against the order dated 28.02.2015 passed by learned Additional
                Judicial Commissioner-I, Ranchi in Criminal Appeal No. 21 of 2015, whereby
                and whereunder, the prayer for bail of the petitioners, which was rejected
                by the order dated 19.01.2015 passed by the learned Principal Magistrate,
                Juvenile Justice Board, Dumerdaga, Ranchi in G.R. Case no. 548 of 2014,
                instituted under <a href="/doc/1279834/" id="a_3">Sections 376(D)</a> and <a href="/doc/1279834/" id="a_4">376</a> of Indian Penal Code and also
                under <a href="/doc/230360/" id="a_5">Section 4</a> of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, has
                been affirmed.
</p><p id="p_2">                      Heard learned counsel for the petitioners as well as learned counsel
                representing the State.
</p><p id="p_3">                      The prosecution case relates to the offence under <a href="/doc/1279834/" id="a_6">Sections 376(D)</a>
                and <a href="/doc/1279834/" id="a_7">376</a> of Indian Penal Code and also under <a href="/doc/230360/" id="a_8">Section 4</a> of Protection of
                Children from Sexual Offences Act
                      It appears from the record that the petitioners were declared juvenile
                by a competent court and thereafter a bail petition was filed by the
                petitioners before the Juvenile Justice Board, Dumerdaga, Ranchi, which
                was rejected vide order dated 19.01.2015. Being aggrieved by the said
                order, the petitioners preferred an appeal bearing Criminal Appeal No. 21 of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                            -2-</span>
         2015 before the Additional Judicial Commissioner-I, Ranchi and the same
         has also been dismissed vide order dated 28.02.2015.
</p><p id="p_4">               Learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that the courts below
         have failed to consider the mandate given under <a href="/doc/1836662/" id="a_9">Section 12</a> of the Act
         wherein irrespective of the offence committed by the petitioners, bail has to
         be granted to a juvenile and that in a Full Bench Judgment of Hon'ble Patna
         High Court, the ratio has been decided that grant of bail is a rule and denial
         or refusal to grant bail is an exception. It was also submitted that the
         petitioners are in custody since 01.02.2014 and that the present revision
         application has been preferred by the petitioner nos. 1 and 2 through their
         natural guardian (mother) and petitioner no.3 through his natural guardian
         father and further submitted that the natural guardian of the petitioners,
         through whom this revision application has been preferred, will take care of
         the petitioners, if they are released on bail.
</p><p id="p_5">               Learned counsel representing the State has no serious objection.
               Considering the submissions of the counsels, the period in custody
         and the mandate given under <a href="/doc/1836662/" id="a_10">Section 12</a> of the Act, I am inclined to release
         the petitioners on bail.
</p><p id="p_6">               Hence, all the three petitioners namely Anish Lakra @ Sunil Oraon,
         Hemant Lakra @ Simon Oraon and Anil Lakra are directed to be released on
         bail, on furnishing bail bond of Rs.10,000/- (Ten Thousand) each with two
         sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of the Juvenile Justice
         Board, Dumerdaga, Ranchi in connection with Itki P.S. Case no. 19 of 2014,
         corresponding to G.R. Case no. 548 of 2014, with a condition that one of the
         bailor must be the mother of the petitioner for petitioner nos. 1 and 2 and
         father for petitioner no.3. The natural guardian of the petitioners are
         directed to produce the petitioners before Juvenile Justice Board,
         Dumerdaga, Ranchi on each and every date, fixed in the concerned case, till
         the conclusion of the inquiry.
</p><p id="p_7">               Accordingly, this revision application is, hereby, allowed. The order
         dated 19.01.2015 passed by Juvenile Justice Board, Dumerdaga, Ranchi in
         G.R. Case No. 548 of 2014 and the order dated 28.02.2015 passed by
         learned Additional Judicial Commissioner -1, Ranchi in Criminal Appeal No.
         21 of 2015 are, hereby, set aside.
