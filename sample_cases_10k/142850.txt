<p id="p_1">           The prosecution presentation, as upheld by the learned

Trial Judge, drew essential sustenance from the last-seen evidence

in the statement of PW-5 Dev Rishi and PW-7 Parveen Kumar and

the eye witness account of PW-3 Balbir Nath.
</p>
<p id="p_2">2.         The detailing of facts in the first instance would be

appropriate for appreciation of the criticism directed at the relevant

finding.
</p>
<p id="p_3">3.         Ram Lal deceased, a younger unmarried brother of PW-2

Bikkar Singh, was residing in Canada. He came over to India on

15.8.1996. After few days stay with his elder sister at Delhi, he came

over to stay with his brother PW-2 Biikkar Singh. Lakhwinder Singh,

Devinder Singh and Kulwinder Singh are three sons of Bikkar Singh.

Ram Lal used to enjoy a drink occasionally.

down to Rahon. While leaving the house, Ram Lal was wearing a

golden chain, a ring and wrist watch. Lakhwinder Singh returned

home in the evening; while Ram Lal did not.      Lakhwinder Singh

informed    Bikkar Singh that Ram Lal stayed over in an Ahata (a

licensed place for taking liquor). Bikkar Singh set out in search of

Ram Lal. He was accompanied by Tarsem Singh alias Babby son of

Gurdev Singh. Ahata owner namely Pandit informed Bikkar Singh

that Ram Lal had been taken away on a Rehra by appellants Rulda

and Rana.    He further informed Bikkar Singh that after the initial

transportation of Ram Lal by Rehra, two appellants had also taken

away the cycle which Ram Lal left at the Ahata. In the light of that

information, Bikkar Singh and Tarsem Singh first went over to the

house of appellant Rana, who was not found available at his house.

When they were on way to the house of appellant Rulda, he (Rulda)

met them enroute near the heaps of debris. On being queried about

the whereabout of Ram Lal, Rulda informed them that Ram Lal was

lying at the house of Rana. Rulda, then, accompanied them to the

house of Rana which (house) was nearby. Thereafter, Rulda ran

away. Ram Lal was not found lying at the house of Rana nor was

Rana found available in the house. On getting verbal information

that one person was lying dead in the Kotha of one Kariami Jat near

the house of Rulda, Bikkar Singh and Tarsem Singh went over there.

They peeped into the house through window and found that dead

body lying there was that of Ram Lal. Bikkar Singh brought along

Ajit Singh Sarpanch of the village to the spot and the trio (Bikkar

Singh, Tarsem Singh and Ajit Singh) entered the room afore-

mentioned and found that Ram Lal had been strangulated with a

rope around his neck and there also were injuries on his head. They

further found that ornaments and the wrist watch, which deceased

was wearing, were missing from the dead body.

</p><p id="p_22">18.        As already noticed and apparent from the record, the

evidence against appellants consists of last seen evidence in the

statement of PW-5 Dev Rishi and PW-7 Parveen Kumar and the

eye witness account in the statement of Balbir Nath.

the learned counsel for the parties.

<p id="p_24">20.        The last seen evidence in the statement of PW-5 Dev

Rishi does not inspire confidence.        PW-5 Dev Rishi categorically

stated that the appellants and Ram Lal had taken liquor at his Ahata

and they left thereafter at about 1.00 A.M. He does not at all make a

mention of the fact that appellants had taken Ram Lal on a Rehra.

As against it PW-7 Parveen Kumar testified that his son Ravi Kumar

had carried appellants Rulda, Rana and also Ram Lal in his Rehra

on hiring charges of Rs. 20/-.     This witness stated in the cross-

examination that police recorded his statement under Section 161
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5"> Criminal Appeal No. 7-DB of 1999                           -6-</span>

                                   ****


<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_1">Cr.P.C</a>. the following day. There is a note by the learned Trial Court

that learned Public Prosecutor was "unable to place on record any

statement of the witness dated 14.9.1996".
</p>
<p id="p_25">21.        Learned Trial Court also noticed that the file does contain

the statement (under <a href="/doc/447673/" id="a_2">Section 161</a> Cr.P.C.) dated 11.10.1996 of

Parveen Kumar. Ravi Kumar afore-mentioned is alive and lives at

Rahon.     PW-7 Parveen Kumar claimed to have told the police that

appellants and also Ram Lal were taken in Rehra by Ravi Kumar.

He was confronted with the statement dated 11.10.1996 where the

fact that those three named persons had been taken by Ravi Kumar

is not mentioned. Apart therefrom, this witness claimed that "I had

not talked with anybody else about my son or myself having taken

the deceased and accused Rulda and Rana in my Rehra".               His

statement is nothing but a creature of padding. Ravi son of PW-7

Parveen Kumar who had allegedly taken two appellants (Rulda and

Rana) and Ram Lal on his Rehra was also not examined at the trial

in spite of the fact that it is in the statement of none else or other

than his father Parveen Kumar PW-7 that his son Ravi Kumar is alive

and lives at village Rahon.      PW-5 Devi Rishi averred that his

statement was recorded by the police after five days of death of Ram

Lal, though the police did visit his Ahata on the second day of the

death of Ram Lal. If there was even an iota of truth in the statement

made by Dev Rishi PW-5, there is no reason why he would not have

notified this fact to the police when it visited his Ahata on the second

day.   Thus, we have no hesitation in discarding the last seen

evidence in the statement of PW-5 Dev Rishi and PW-7 Parveen

Kumar.
</p>
<p id="p_26">22.        The eye witness account of PW-3 Balbir Nath also does

sound credible. He claimed to have seen appellant Rana helping

one person alight from the Rehra, though that person could not

manage himself and fell down upon the ground. It is in his statement

that Rulda appellant took some money from Rana appellant, made

payment to the Rehrawala and thereafter both the appellants lifted

that person to the room which they closed from inside. It gave an

idea to PW-3 Balbir Nath that there was something foul in their

conduct.   After 10-15 minutes thereof, he went near the room,

peeped into it through the window and found that appellant Rulda

was holding a rope around the neck of that stranger. Appellant

Rulda strangulated the stranger; while appellant Rana gave brick

blow on the head of the stranger. When Balbir Nath called upon the

appellant to indicate why they had done that act, the appellants held

out a threat that he should get away from there or else he would also

be treated in that very fashion. He claimed to have told the police

that he had spotted appellant Rana sitting on the Rehra while holding

the stranger and that appellant Rulda was walking along the Rehra.

His attention was drawn to his statement Ex. DA where that fact was

not found mentioned. He claimed to have re-iterated that fact even

in the course of a statement which he made to the Magistrate under

<a href="/doc/497457/" id="a_3">Section 164</a> Cr.P.C.    He has confronted with statement Ex. DB

wherein that fact was not found recorded.     He further claimed to

                                    ****


have told the police and the Magistrate( the former in the statement

under <a href="/doc/447673/" id="a_4">Section 161</a> Cr.P.C.) and the latter in the statement under

<a href="/doc/497457/" id="a_5">Section 164</a> Cr.P.C. that Rana appellant was supporting the stranger

and helping him alight from the Rehra and that stranger fell upon the

ground. His attention was drawn towards Ex. DA and Ex. DB where

that fact was not found to have been recorded. He further claimed to

have told the police that appellants Rana and Rulda lifted the

stranger and took him inside Kariama's room.         This fact was not

found mentioned in Ex. DA. He further claimed to have told the

police that window of the room was initially not covered with any

piece of gunny bag but that it was after about 15-10 minutes of the

occurrence that    pieces of gunny bags were found covering the

window. He was confronted with Ex. DA and also Ex. DB where this

fact was not noticed.
</p>
<p id="p_27">23.         It would be apparent from a perusal of the above that

though this witness claimed to have mentioned every relevant piece

of evidence to the police and to the Magistrate, those facts were

found missing from Ex. DA and also Ex. DB. It is pertinent to notice

in that context that he did not raise any alarm on witnessing the

impugned occurrence. However, he claimed to have brought this

fact to the notice of Sat Pal Joshi, President of the Committee that

manages the cremation ground. He was not examined at the trial.

He was staying at a distance of 10-15 karams from the police when it

prepared the inquest report but did not bring facts to the notice of the

police at that point of time. In the totality of the facts noticed above,

we do not find his testimony to be credible.
</p>
<p id="p_28">24.        Insofar as PW-2 Bikkar Singh is concerned, his son

Lakhwinder Singh had allegedly accompanied Ram Lal to Rahon on

an independent cycle. Lakhwinder Singh was not examined at the

trial. Further, Bikkar Singh claimed to have gone in search of Ram

lal in the company of Tarsem Singh alias Babby          son of Gurdev

Singh and it was in the presence of Tarsem Singh that Dev Rishi

Pandit told Bikkar Singh that Ram Lal had been taken away on a

Rehra by both the appellants. Tarsem Singh aforementioned was

not examined at the trial.
</p>
<p id="p_29">25.        In the light of the foregoing discussion, it is evident that

both segments of evidence (last seen evidence and eye witness

account) adduced by the prosecution do not appear credible.

</p><p id="p_30">26.        We do not find that the prosecution had been able to

adduce evidence, substantive in character, to nail the appellants who
