</p><p id="p_2">1.           This order will dispose of this claim petition initially filed by the
deceased Prabhu Dayal himself for the injuries suffered by him in a road
accident dated 11.8.2004. At the time of accident at 9.30 pm Prabhu Dayal
was going to Mayur Vihar, Phase-II on his bicycle. When he reached opposite
DTC Depot at main road after crossing the red light of Mayur Vihar, Phase-II on
Ghaziabad Highway he was hit by one speeding truck bearing registration no.
PB-29A-9598 from behind causing his accident.

years on 9.8.2006. He has left behind his widow and two daughters. No


Suit No. 299/06                                                                2/10
 postmortem of the dead body was conducted.
</p>

Satpal. After the death of Prabhu Dayal his legal heirs were brought on record.
In the course of the inquiry it was found that vehicle was insured with Oriental
Insurance Co. Ltd. Amended memo of parties was filed on 11.7.2007.
</p>

<p id="p_6">5.           The record shows that written statement was filed by R1 Satpal on
3.3.2008 and Insurance Company also field written statement on 5.3.2008 not
disputing of giving insurance cover to the vehicle involved in the accident of
Prabhu Dayal.

</p>

<p id="p_13">7.           Ms. Meena one of the daughter of Prabhu Dayal and Smt.
Shyama Devi widow of Sh. Prabhu Dayal has filed their affidavit of evidence.
They have been examined as PW-1 and PW-2. No other witness has been
examined in the inquiry by either of the respondents.
</p>

<p id="p_14">8.           Heard the counsel for the petitioner and counsel for the Insurance

Suit No. 299/06                                                              3/10
 company.
</p>

<p id="p_15">9.           Issue wise disposal of the inquiry is as under:
</p>

<p id="p_16">10.          Issue no.1 and 2 are based on the common facts and evidence
and as such are taken up together.
</p>

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">ISSUE NO.1 AND 2</span>
<p id="p_17">11.          Both PW-1 and PW-2 have deposed that Prabhu Dayal suffered a
road accident on 11.8.2004. Copy of the police challan and FIR has been
proved as Ex.PW1/2 and Ex.PW1/3. The FIR has been registered on the
statement of the deceased himself wherein the number of the offending vehicle
has been given. In this FIR deceased has attributed the rash and negligent
driving to the driver of the truck. Copy of the charge sheet against the driver

has also been filed on record. In Basant Kaur &amp; Ors. V. Chattar Pal Singh &amp; 

Ors. 2003 ACJ 369 M.P. (DB) it was held that registration of a criminal case
against the driver of the offending vehicle is enough to record the finding that
the driver of offending vehicle is responsible for causing the accident.
</p>

<p id="p_18">12.          The testimony of PW-1 and 2 coupled with copy of FIR and charge
sheet against the driver bring sufficient material on record to come to the
conclusion that accident of Prabhu Dayal in the present case was caused
because of rash and negligent driving of truck bearing no. PB-29A-9598 by the
driver.
</p>

<p id="p_19">13.          It has been submitted by the counsel for the Insurance Company
that Prabhu Dayal has expired after two years of the accident and no
postmortem of the dead body of Prabhu Dayal has been conducted and


Suit No. 299/06                                                             4/10
 as such it is to be treated as a case of natural death.    The counsel for the
petitioner states that after the accident Prabhu Dayal was under continuous
medical treatment and his death was on account of the injuries suffered by him
in the accident.
</p>

<p id="p_20">14.          The death of Prabhu Dayal in the present case has taken place on
9.8.2006 almost after about two years of his accident which happened on
11.8.2004. Copy of his death certificate has been placed on record. As may
be noted in the MLC Ex.PW1/4 at the time of the accident the age of the
deceased has been mentioned as 64 years.          In the present time of good
medical facilities and medical advancement it cannot be said that 65 years of
age is a age of natural death to any person. Usually people are living long life
unless they are suffering from any ailment or disease. The medical bills of the
petitioner in the present case on record has been filed last upto 30.5.2005. All
these medical bills are in continuation since after the accident of Prabhu Dayal
and this only suggest that Prabhu Dayal has undergone prolong treatment after
the accident.
</p>

<p id="p_21">15.          There is nothing on record to show that death of Prabhu Dayal in
the present case has occurred because of any other reason other than injuries
suffered by him in road accident on 11.8.2004. No doubt that postmortem could
have been a vital clue to find out the reason of death of Prabhu Dayal but
simply because there is no postmortem does not mean that it should be
presumed to be a case of natural death as suggested. Support may also be
drawn from the judgment reported in the matter of <a href="/doc/198176/" id="a_3">Habibnur Khan and Others
V. Govind Singh and another</a> 2007 ACJ 1329 (Rajasthan). In this case
death had occurred after 11 months of the accident. There was no postmortem
and it was held that a strict proof of a criminal case cannot be adopted while
dealing with a civil liability in a motor accident claim. Similarly in State of

Suit No. 299/06                                                             5/<a href="/doc/1264629/" id="a_4">10
 Haryana and others V. Sukhpal and others</a> 2008 ACJ 158 (Punjab and
Haryana) death occurred after one year and seven months of the accident.
Deceased suffered fracture of spine and had become paraplegic. Deceased
remained hospitalized for a year and died after seven months of discharge. It
was contended that the death occurred after seven months of the discharge
from the hospital be treated as a natural death. It was observed that there was
no evidence that deceased suffered any other injury or ailment like heart
disease or stroke. It was held that a gap of seven months does not suggest
that this was a natural death.
</p>

<p id="p_22">16.            Similar is the position in the present case. There is no evidence to
suggest that death of Prabhu Dayal in the present case was for the reason
other than the injuries suffered by him.        Admittedly the treatment of the
deceased Prabhu Dayal had continued for long time for the injuries suffered by
him in accident.     There is no cross examination of PW-1 or PW-2 by the
counsel of the insurance company to suggest that it was a case of natural
death. The deceased was a class IV employee and if because of the poor
background of the petitioners the postmortem of the dead body of Prabhu
Dayal has not been conducted, this lapse cannot deny the petitioners their
legitimate claim to which they are entitled to otherwise. It would always be
kept in mind that claim under <a href="/doc/785258/" id="a_5">Motor Vehicle Act</a> is based on a welfare
legislation.
</p>

<p id="p_23">17.            In written statement filed by and on behalf of R1 the plea taken
that the truck bearing no. PB-29-A-9598 was not involved in the accident of
Prabhu Dayal deceased herein is only to be rejected. The FIR has been
registered on the statement of the injured. The number of the vehicle involved
in his accident has been given in the FIR. The FIR is of the very next day of
the accident on 11.8.2004. There is no delay in the FIR. There is no reason

Suit No. 299/06                                                                6/10
 for the petitioner to falsely implicate the driver of the vehicle when the same is
not involved in this accident.     No motive has been imputed even by the
respondent to Prabhu Dayal to falsely implicate the driver of the truck in the
accident of Prabhu Dayal. Charge sheet has been filed against the driver.
These facts taken together are sufficient to come to the conclusion that the
accident of Prabhu Dayal has taken place because of the involvement of truck
bearing no. PB-29-A-9598 only. No defence evidence has been adduced by
the respondent to support this defence even. Issue no.1 and 2 are disposed of
accordingly.
</p>

<p id="p_24">ISSUE NO.3
</p><p id="p_25">18.            Since it has been held that it is not a case of natural death and
death of Prabhu Dayal has taken place because of the injuries suffered by him
in the alleged accident on 11.8.2004 the widow and two daughters who are
surviving legal heirs are entitled for compensation under the head of loss of
dependency.
</p>

<p id="p_26">19.            No age proof of Prabhu Dayal has been placed on record. In his
MLC his age has been mentioned as 64 years. Same has to be presumed in
the absence of any other document as the document of age of deceased
Prabhu Dayal.       The medical bills of Prabhu Dayal have been proved
collectively as Ex.PW1/5. Same is the amount of Rs. 36,410/-. This amount is
awarded to the petitioners. The petitioners are also awarded a sum of
Rs. 5000/- for conveyance and also a sum of Rs. 10,000/- for special diet of
deceased as after the accident deceased was under treatment for a long
period of time. As per PW-1 and PW-2 initially he was admitted in Lady
Harding Hospital and he was also treated in Ram Lal Mukund Lal Orthopedic
Hospital, Paharganj and thereafter his treatment continued in Ganga Ram
Hospital. There is no rebbutal or cross examination of these facts.
</p>
<p id="p_27">Suit No. 299/06                                                               7/10
</p><p id="p_28"> 20.          In affidavit filed by PW-1 and PW-2 it has been deposed that
deceased earlier was employed in Delhi Administration and after retirement
was self employed and was earning Rs. 6000/- p.m.            He was providing
services of cleaning of 105 shops situated in Subzi Market at Hauz Qazi, Delhi
and was charging Rs. 50/- per shop. No documentary proof has been filed on
record.
</p>

<p id="p_29">21.          For the injuries suffered by Prabhu Dayal it is to be presumed that
he was unable to work for a period of one year. Taking minimum wages into
account which were Rs. 2894.90 paisa (rounded of to Rs. 2895/-) the
petitioners are awarded a compensation for the loss of income for a period of
twelve months and amount of compensation would thus be Rs. 2895 X 12 =
Rs. 34740/-. Same is awarded to legal representatives of the deceased on
account of loss of income.
</p>

<p id="p_30">22.          Taking the age of deceased as 64 years in MLC as correct and
also taking into account the fact that death of Prabhu Dayal has occurred after
two years of the accident the age of deceased would be 66 years when he
died. The appropriate multiplier would be of 5. The widow be presumed as
only surviving legal heir for the purpose of loss of dependency. The other two
daughters are married and are major by age and are having their own family.
The amount of compensation under the head of loss of dependency would be
Rs. 2895 X 12 X 5 = Rs.1,73,700/-. Out of this amount one half has to be
deducted and the amount awarded on account of loss of dependency would
be Rs. 86850/-. Same is awarded to the petitioners.
</p>

<p id="p_31">23.          The petitioners are also awarded a sum of Rs. 40,000/- under the
conventional heads of loss of consortium, loss of love and affection, loss of

Suit No. 299/06                                                             8/10
 estate and funeral expenses.
</p>

<p id="p_32">24.          Keeping in view all the relevant factors, principles of law laid down
in above mentioned case and evidence on record this Tribunal is of the view
that the petitioner is entitled for compensation as per following details.
</p>

<pre id="pre_2">1.    Medical expenses                              :      Rs.     36,410/-
2.    Conveyance                                    :      Rs.      5,000/-
3.    Special diet                                  :      Rs.     10,000/-
