premises) by the Bank in the proceedings before the

Debt Recovery Tribunal under the provisions of the

Recovery of the Debts Due to Banks and Financial

Institutions Act, 1993 (hereinafter referred to as the

respondents to take possession of the licensed

premises in terms of Leave and License Agreement

and deposit Agreement dated 27th November, 1998.

The respondents refused to refund security deposit as

undertaken by the Bank.

Bank of India V/s. Debt Recovery Tribunal and Ors

reported in AIR 1999 SC 1381,                             wherein the

question was whether the Tribunal had jurisdiction to

decide the claim of an "undetermined" amount and

whether such claim was "debt" within the meaning of

<a href="/doc/216578/" id="a_18">Section 2(g)</a> of the Act.                   In the said judgment, the

Supreme Court has held the expression "debt" has to

be given the widest amplitude to mean any liability

which is alleged as due from any person by a bank

during the course of any business activity undertaken

by the Bank either in cash or otherwise, whether

secured or unsecured, whether payable under a decree

recoverable on the date of the application.

maintainable.               Mr.      Tulzapurkar,   Learned          Senior

Counsel contended that in terms of Clause-(n) of

the premises on leave and license basis for its banking

business is an activity incidental to the promotion and

judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of Eureka

Forbes V/s. Allahabad Bank, reported in (2010) 6

SCC 193 and more particularly paras-47 and 64 which

read thus ;

<p id="p_37">

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_6">       "47.           The next question of law, that we

       Recovery Act, on which the entire case of the

       vehemence that, there was no privity of

    <a href="/doc/201374/" id="a_24">Recovery Act</a> is incapable of being given a

    must be given appropriate plain and simple
    meaning. There is no occasion for the Court
    to restrict the meaning of the word `any
    liability', `any person' and particularly the
    words `in cash or otherwise'. Under <a href="/doc/216578/" id="a_25">Section
    2</a> (g), a claim has to be raised by the Bank
    against any person which is due to Bank on
    account of/in the course of any business
    activity undertaken by the Bank. In the
    present case, Bank had admittedly granted
    financial assistance to respondent nos. 2
    and 3, who in turn had hypothecated the
    goods, plants and machinery in favour of the
    Bank. There cannot be any dispute before us
    that the goods in question have been sold by
    the appellant without the consent of the
    Bank. Respondent nos. 2 and 3 have hardly
    raised any dispute and resistance, to the
    claim of the Bank. In fact, even before this
    Court there is no representation on their
    behalf. The documentary and oral evidence
    on record clearly established that the Bank
    has raised a financial claim upon the
    principal debtor, as well as upon the person
    who had intermeddled and/or at least dealt
    with        the      charged   goods   without       any
    authority in law. Not only this, the appellant

relied on para-50 of the judgment, of Eureka Forbes

under the said Act in the context of the Statute and the

Objects and Reasons of the said Act is;



</p><blockquote id="blockquote_10">          "STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS

          Banks and financial institutions at present
          experience             considerable        difficulties         in
          recovering            loans        and   enforcement            of
          securities charged with them. The existing
          procedure for recovery of debts due to the
          banks and financial institutions has blocked a
          significant          portion        of   their     funds        in
          unproductive assets, the value of which
          deteriorates with the passage of time. The
          Committee on the Financial System headed
          by Shri M. Narasimham has considered the
          setting up of the Special Tribunals with
          special powers for adjudication of such
          matters and speedy recovery as critical to
          the       successful             implementation       of      the

       financial sector reforms. An urgent need was,
       therefore, felt to work               out a suitable
       mechanism through which the dues to the
       banks and financial institutions could be
       realised without delay. In 1981 a Committee
       under the chairmanship of Shri T. Tiwari had
       examined the legal and other difficulties
       faced by banks and financial institutions and
       suggested           remedial    measures        including
       changes in law. The Tiwari Committee had
       also suggested setting up of Special Tribunals
       for recovery of dues of the banks and
       financial institutions by following a summary
       procedure.            The   setting   up   of     Special
       Tribunals will not only fulfill a long-felt need,
       but also will be an important step in the
       implementation of the Report of Narasimham
       Committee. Whereas on September 30, 1990,
       more than fifteen lakhs of cases filed by the
       public sector banks and about 304 cases filed
       by the financial institutions were pending in
       various courts, recovery of debts involved
       more than Rs. 5,622 crores in dues of public
       sector banks and about Rs. 391 crores of
       dues of financial institutions. The locking up
       of such huge amount of public money in
       litigation prevents proper utilisation and
       recycling of the funds for the development of
       the country.

the <a href="/doc/201374/" id="a_31">Recovery Act</a> was enacted primarily for the

unnecessary delay, so as to avoid any adverse

state that Banks and financial institutions were

experiencing considerable difficulties in recovering

loans and enforcements of securities charged with

them. The then existing procedure for recovery of dues

of the Bank and the financial institutions blocked

<p id="p_55">28.                      Thus, in the case of Eureka Forbes

(supra), as well as, in United Bank of India (supra),

liability as 'due' arose in course of core banking

business. It is in this context of the facts in the given

cases, expression "Debt" has been interpreted which is

in tune with object and scheme of the Act. In the case

in hand, if petitioner's contention is accepted, then,

every liability claimed as 'due' in the course of business

activity in the terms of <a href="/doc/863596/" id="a_35">Section 6(1)</a> of the Banking

Regulation Act has to be adjudged in the proceedings

under <a href="/doc/569017/" id="a_36">Section 17</a> of the said Act.                   To test the

arguments of the petitioners, let us take a hypothetical

case, where a Bank in the course of its business

activity acquires right or agrees to acquires rights in

immovable property. May the 'right' be proprietary in

nature or otherwise for consideration and Bank has

paid substantial amount to the owner in terms of the

Agreement. Say, if the dispute arises and if the Bank

seeks to recover the amount, question would arise,

where proceedings would lie ?                      If we uphold the

contention of Learned Senior Counsel, Mr. Tulzapurkar

then the consideration or part consideration, paid to

the owner would constitute a 'debt' and for its refund,

claim has to be filed under <a href="/doc/569017/" id="a_37">Section 17</a> of the said Act

before the DRT. In our view, this would run counter to

the object and scheme of the said Act. The object and

scheme of the              said Act, is to ensure attainment of

legislative        object          i.e.   expeditious     recovery            and

provisions of taking such measures, which would

prevent wastage of securities available with Banks and

Financial Institutions (emphasis supplied).                                  This

proposition, if accepted,                  would invest the Tribunal

with all powers of Civil Court, which is not intended by

the Legislature.

<p id="p_65">

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_14">       "37.           The point we are trying to
       make is that apart from the principal
       business of accepting deposits and lending
       the said 1949 Act leaves ample scope for
       the banking companies to venture into new
       businesses subject to such businesses
       being subject to the control of the
       Regulator, viz. RBI. In other words, the
       1949 Act allows banking companies to
       undertake activities and businesses as
       long as they do not attract prohibitions
       and restrictions like those contained in
       <a href="/doc/484569/" id="a_42">Sections 8</a> and <a href="/doc/1838687/" id="a_43">9</a>. In this connection we
       need to emphasize that <a href="/doc/41510/" id="a_44">Section 6(1)(n)</a>
       enables a banking company to do all things
       as are incidental or conducive to
       promotion or advancement of the business
       of the company. <a href="/doc/41510/" id="a_45">Section 6(1)</a> enables
       banking companies to carry on different
       types of businesses. Under <a href="/doc/41510/" id="a_46">Section 6(1)</a>,
       these different types of businesses are in
       addition to business of banking, viz., core
       banking. The importance of the words "in
       addition to" in <a href="/doc/41510/" id="a_47">Section 6(1)</a> is that even if

       lending so that its main income is from the
       spread or what is called as "interest
       income". Thus, we may broadly categorise
       the functions of the banking company into
       two parts, viz., core banking of accepting
       deposits and lending and miscellaneous
       functions and services. Section 6 of the BR
       Act, 1949 provides for the form of business
       in which banking companies may engage.
       Thus, RBI is empowered to enact a policy
       which would enable banking companies to
       engage in activities in addition to core
       banking and in the process it defines as to
       what constitutes "banking business"."

<p id="p_66">.      It is therefore submitted by Mr. Tulzapurkar,

Learned Senior Counsel, that the security deposit was

given to the respondent for obtaining the premises on

leave and license basis and therefore it is one of the

forms of business in terms of <a href="/doc/1463767/" id="a_48">Section 6</a> of the Banking

Regulation Act. He would therefore contend that, since

the respondent declined to refund the security amount,

which was given to him in the course of the Banking

business, it is a "debt" within the meaning of <a href="/doc/216578/" id="a_49">Section

2(g)</a> of the Act and therefore the proceedings filed

under <a href="/doc/569017/" id="a_50">Section 17</a> of the said Act were maintainable.

dealt with in the foregoing paras.                 Mr. Tulzapurkar,

Senior Counsel may be right in saying that, acquiring

the premises on leave and license basis for the

temporary period is one of the forms of businesses

contemplated               under     <a href="/doc/1463767/" id="a_56">Section   6</a>   of   the       Banking
