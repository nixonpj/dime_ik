                                    ORDER
</pre><p id="p_1">               This order will dispose off a bail application dated
27.08.2011 for releasing the accused Dr. Udaiveer Singh on
bail.
</p><p id="p_2">2.             I have heard arguments on bail application and
perused file.
</p><p id="p_3">3.             Bail has been sought on the ground that accused
has been in J.C. since 01.06.2008. Material witnesses have
already been examined. IO of this case was examined on
15.04.2011.          Prosecution wants to examine one more
witness but he is not coming and accused is languishing in
jail.   Earlier     bail    application     was    rejected    by     the   ld.
predecessor on the ground that case is likely to be decided
on merit. It has been prayed that accused may be released
on bail as he is ready to furnish the reliable and sound
surety to the satisfaction of the court and no useful purpose
would be served in keeping him in jail.
</p><p id="p_4">4.             On     the     other    hand,      Ld.    Additional    Public
Prosecutor opposed the bail application on the ground that
accused is facing trial in a heinous crime of murder of a

 person named Ram Sumer. The last witness of prosecution
namely Sh. O.P. Mishra Additional DCP could not be
examined so far as he has been availing medical leave due
to his operation/bypass surgery.
</p><p id="p_5">5.             On perusal of file, I find that my ld. predecessor
vide   her     order   dated    16.03.2011       dismissed   the   bail
application. No fresh ground has been shown for releasing
the accused except that prosecution could not examined Sh.
O.P. Mishra, Additional DCP. In my view and in view of the
report which are being received on summons to witness, the
witness could not come due to his bypass surgery. In these
circumstances, prosecution cannot be faulted for his non
appearance.
</p><p id="p_6">6.             My attention goes to a case <a href="/doc/500640/" id="a_3">Anwari Begum v.
Sher Mohammad, (SC</a>), 2005 Cri.L.J. 4132 : 2005 A.I.R.
(SC) 3530 the apex court observed:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">       "It is necessary for the Courts dealing with application for
       bail to consider among other circumstances, the following
       factors also before granting bail, they are :

<blockquote id="blockquote_2">       1. The nature of accusation and the severity of punishment
       in case of conviction and the nature of supporting evidence;

       apprehension of threat to the complainant;

       charge."

<p id="p_7">7.             My attention also goes to a case Gobarbhai
Naranbhai Singala v. State of Gujarat, (SC) 2008 A.I.R.

       "25. This Court in Amarmani Tripathi's case (supra) had held
      that while considering the application for bail, what is
      required to be looked is, (i) whether there is any prima facie
      or reasonable ground to believe that the accused had
      committed the offence; (ii) nature and gravity of the charge;
</p><p id="p_9">      (iii) severity of the punishment in the event of conviction;
</p><p id="p_10">      (iv) danger of accused absconding or fleeing if released on
      bail; (v) character, behaviour, means, position and standing
      of the accused; (vi) likelihood of the offence being repeated;
</p><p id="p_11">      (vii) reasonable apprehension of the witnesses being
      tampered with; and (viii) danger, of course, of justice being
      thwarted by grant of bail.
</p>
<p id="p_12">8.             Keeping in view the principles of law laid down in
<a href="/doc/500640/" id="a_5">Anwari     Begum        v.     Sher      Mohammad</a>,      (supra),   and
<a href="/doc/945721/" id="a_6">Gobarbhai Naranbhai Singala v. State of Gujarat</a>,
(supra), cases which are applicable on the facts of present
case because accused is facing trial of a heinous crime and
no fresh ground appeared for bail after dismissal of his
application on 16.03.2011 by my ld. predecessor therefore, I
am of the view that there are no merits in the bail
application. Consequently, bail application is dismissed.
