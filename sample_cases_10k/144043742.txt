                      18.11.2003.      While riding his motorcycle, he was dashed by

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                                               1</span>
19.05.2005.       After the death of           Illa Raj Singh Thakur, his

legal heirs, who are appellants before us, got amended the

claim petition and claimed compensation of Rs.20,63,681/-.

</p><p id="p_5">      The    averment       in   the   claim     petition        filed    by   the

appellants was that death was caused due to the accident

and the respondents are liable to pay compensation treating

death as a result of the accident.                The appellants produced

oral evidence of three Doctors viz. Dr. Sood, Dr. Tiwari

and Dr. Yogesh.
</p>
<p id="p_6">      The Tribunal, after hearing learned counsel for the

parties and considering all evidence on record, came to the

conclusion that death cannot be said to have been caused

due to the accident.             The Tribunal, however, allowed the

claim petition which was initially filed by Illa Raj Singh

Thakur     and    awarded     compensation        of    Rs.1,13,018/-          with

interest.
</p>
<p id="p_7">      The appellants filed an appeal before the High Court

against the order of the Tribunal.               The High Court vide its

judgment and order allowed the appeal in part and enhanced

the amount from Rs.1,13,018/- to Rs.1,48,018/- along with

interest     at    6%   per      annum     on     the        enhanced    sum    of

Rs.35,000/-.
</p>
<p id="p_8">      Learned       counsel      for     the    appellants,        in    support

thereof, contends that there were ample medical evidence in

the form of oral evidence of three Doctors particularly,

Dr. Tiwari which has amply proved that death was the result

of   the   injuries     sustained        due    to     the    accident.        The

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                       2</span>
operation of the wrist undertaken is consequent to the

injuries.      He further submitted that the Tribunal erred in

rejecting the case of the claimants and further the High

Court has also not dealt with the said issue in a correct

manner.      The evidence of Dr. Tiwari was also not considered

by the Tribunal in right perspective due to which there was

an error in holding that death was not a result of the

accident.
</p>
<p id="p_9">       He further submitted that in any case, the claim

which was allowed by the Tribunal and modified a little by

the   High    Court      was   too   meagre.      He   submits       that   the

deceased      was     awarded    only       Rs.10,000/-   for    pain       and

sufferings whereas he went under trauma for about one and a

half years.
</p>
<p id="p_10">       Learned counsel appearing for the respondents refuted

the submission made by learned counsel for the appellants

and contends that the Tribunal has rightly come to the

conclusion that death cannot be related to the accident.

The oral evidence has been correctly marshalled by the

Tribunal.       It is further submitted that insofar as the

amount awarded by the Tribunal, the same has already been

enhanced by the High Court by Rs.35,000/-.

</p><p id="p_11">       We have considered the submissions made by learned

counsel for the parties and perused the record.

</p><p id="p_12">       Coming       to   the    first   submission     made     by    learned

counsel for the appellants that death was a result of the

accident, the Tribunal, for coming to the conclusion that

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                        3</span>
death   cannot     be   related   to       the   accident,    has   not   only

considered the evidence of all three Doctors but also the

other oral evidence on the record including the statement

of Ramkali Thakur (AW-3).
</p>
<p id="p_13">        Learned    counsel    for      the       appellant     submits     the

statement of       Dr. P.K. Tiwari has not been given correct

interpretation.
</p>
<p id="p_14">        We do not agree with the submission made by learned

counsel   for     the   appellants.          The   evidence    of   Dr.   P.K.

Tiwari was thoroughly considered by the Tribunal.                         The

Tribunal while considering the evidence of Dr. P.K. Tiwari

observed as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_15">   “However, Dr. P.K. Tiwari has stated that he had
   examined   Illraj  on   12/5/2005   and  advised  for
   investigation of diabetes and also advised to have
   treatment with an orthopedic doctor at any good
   hospital at Nagpur.    This witness has also stated
   that at the time Illraj Singh had about the pain and
   swelling in the right forearm and mucus / fluid
   secretion from the mid of the right forearm.      But
   this witness has not clearly stated that he had found
   the secretion of fluid from the injuries at the mid
   of the right forearm of Illraj Singh.      So, by the
   production of the evidences by the applicants it has
   not been conclusively proved that the cause of death
   of Illraj Singh was due the infections in wounds
   which were inflicted in the accident. Rather it has
   been proved themselves by the applicants that
   deceased Illraj Singh joined his duties after
   recovering from the injuries.     Thus for the above
   mentioned two questions are concluded in the said
   terms.”

        Thus, we do not find any infirmity in the findings of

the Tribunal in holding that death of the deceased cannot be

imputed as a result of the accident.                   Now we come to the

second submission of learned counsel for the appellants that


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                       4</span>
   the amount under different heads has not been appropriately

   granted to the appellants.                We     have    looked     into        the

   different    claims   awarded    by       the    Tribunal.    The       claim   of

   Rs.73,018/- which was expenses of treatment has been fully

   allowed.    We, however, notice that the Tribunal has allowed a

   very meagre amount of Rs.10,000/- for physical and mental

   agony.     The sequence of events and the treatment undertaken

   by the deceased consequent to the accident are all detailed

   in the evidence on the record.                 We are of the view that the

   amount awarded towards physical and mental agony was too

   meagre.     To meet the ends of justice, the said amount be

   enhanced by an amount of Rs.50,000/-.

</p><p id="p_16">         The appeal is partly allowed.                     The compensation is

   further    enhanced   by   a   sum    of       Rs.50,000/-.       The   enhanced

   amount shall carry interest at 6% per annum.
