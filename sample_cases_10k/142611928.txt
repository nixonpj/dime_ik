                         THE HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE RAKESH KUMAR


Rakesh Kumar, J.                     Two petitioners, while invoking inherent jurisdiction

                      of this Court under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_2">Section 482</a> of the Code of Criminal

                      Procedure, have prayed for quashing of the order dated

                      19.1.2000 passed by Sri K.S. Singh 'Sengar', Judicial

                      Magistrate, 1st Class, Rosera in C.R. No.705 of 1998. By the

                      said order, the learned Magistrate has taken cognizance of

                      offence under <a href="/doc/1011035/" id="a_3">Sections 323</a>,<a href="/doc/988620/" id="a_4">406</a>,<a href="/doc/1317063/" id="a_5">465</a>, <a href="/doc/105503/" id="a_6">417</a> and <a href="/doc/1466184/" id="a_7">471</a> of the Indian

                      Penal Code and directed for issuance of summons to the

                      petitioners.
</p>
<p id="p_11">                                     2. Short facts of the case is that Opp.Party no.2 filed

                      a complaint, vide Complaint case No.705 of 1998              alleging

                      therein that petitioner no.1 was the Secretary and petitioner no.2
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                       2</span>




was the Chairman of Mithila Dugdh Utpadak Sahyog Samiti,

Mahathi and in such capacity they had committed several

misconduct and misappropriation of fund of the society and also

the petitioners by committing fraud had obtained signature of

several members of the Society and by committing fraud they

got themselves selected again as Secretary and Chairman of the

Society respectively and on objection raised by the complainant ,

the complainant was abused.
</p>
<p id="p_12">            3. Sri Gopal Pandey, learned counsel appearing on

behalf of the petitioners, while pressing the present petition, has

vehemently argued that the present complain petition was filed

maliciously due to the reason that in the election of the society

when Opp.Party no.2       was defeated , he filed the instant

complaint petition. It was argued that the entire proceeding in

complaint petition is liable to be quashed on the ground that it is

a malicious prosecution. Learned counsel for the petitioners has

referred to Annexures 2 and 3 to the present petition, which are

photo copies of the audit report of the Society in question by a

company of Chartered Accountant and during the audit no

irregularity was found in the society. Accordingly, it has been

prayed for quashing of the order dated 19.1.2000 as well as

entire prosecution.
</p>
<p id="p_13">            4.    In this case despite the fact that Opp.Party no.2

had entered his appearance through his Advocate, at the time of

hearing none has come forward on behalf of Opp.Party no.2.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                       3</span>




</p><p id="p_14">            5.      Smt. Indu Bala Pandey , learned Addl.Public

Prosecutor has appeared on behalf of the State and has opposed

the prayer of the petitioners.
</p>
<p id="p_15">            6.    In ordinary course, the Court is not required to

interfere with the order of cognizance, while exercising power

under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_8">Section 482</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure. However,

in peculiar facts and circumstances of the present case, it is

necessary to interfere with the impugned order. The Court is

satisfied that since Opp.Party no.2 was defeated in the general

election and he was ceased to be member of the committee of

the Society , the present complaint petition was filed.

</p><p id="p_16">            7.     In the present complaint petition, a vague and

bald allegation was made and on such untenable allegation, the

proceeding in the present complaint was initiated against the

petitioners. Moreover, the order of cognizance, which was

passed on 19.1.2000, was stayed by this Court, while admitting

the present petition for hearing on 14.3.2000 and order of stay is

still continuing. Accordingly, in view of the facts and

circumstances of the case as well as in view of pendency of the

case for such a long time, it is desirable to interfere with the

impugned order.
</p>
<p id="p_17">            8.     In view of the facts and circumstances, the

Court is satisfied that allowing the prosecution on such a

complaint petition will amount to allowing abuse of the process

of the court and, as such, the order of cognizance dated
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                                4</span>




                        19.1.2000 and also all subsequent proceedings in C.R. No.705

                        of 1998 are quashed.
</p>
<p id="p_18">                                   Accordingly, petition stands allowed.


</p><p id="p_19">                                                                 ( Rakesh Kumar, J )
