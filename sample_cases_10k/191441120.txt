 Vipin   and   Radhey.       Police   was   informed   and   PCR   van   rushed

Singh,   Anish,   Meharban   and   Bijender   admitted   there.     Injured

</p>
<p id="p_3">3.                 Prosecution,   in   order   to   prove   its   case,   examined   11 

witnesses.   Statements of accused were recorded u/s 313 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_7">Cr.P.C</a>. 

wherein   they   denied   all   the   allegations   made   against   them   and

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">FIR No.  992/06; State Vs. Saurav Singh Etc.                                Page 3 of 26</span>
</p><p id="p_4"> 4.                 I have heard Ld. Defence counsel and the Ld. APP for 

State and have perused the entire records.
</p>
<p id="p_5">5.                 Ld.   Counsel   for   accused   argued   that   the   accused 

persons   have   been   falsely   implicated   in   this   case   since   no   injury 

was   caused   by   the   accused   persons   to   the   injured   persons   as 

alleged   on   17­10­2006.     The   injured   persons   were   taking   liquor 

outside their house and when the accused persons objected to their 

taking liquor outside the house, they beaten up the accused persons 

with iron rods and dandas.  Even, the injured persons entered in the 

house of accused  Sauran Singh and beat him with iron  rods and 

dandas.  The public gathered there and pelted stones on the injured 

persons   due   to   which   they   sustained   injuries.     Moreover,   when 

Saroj, wife of the accused Sauran Singh came to rescue him, she 

was   also   beaten   up   by   the   injured   persons   and   also   sustained 

injuries.   The Ld. Counsel for the accused further argued that the 

accused herein are the injured persons in the other cross case vide 

FIR no. 991/06, PS Uttam Nagar, Delhi and in the aforesaid FIR no. 

991/06, the accused persons are the injured persons in the present 

case vide FIR no. 992/06.   All the writing work was manipulated in 

the PS so that false evidence may be created against the accused 

persons.  The iron rod, danda and brick have also been planted on 

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">FIR No.  992/06; State Vs. Saurav Singh Etc.                              Page 4 of 26</span>
 the accused persons.  Dr. Uday Kumar Singh who examined himself 

as   PW8   and   PW11   admitted   in   his   cross­examination   that   the 

injuries   mentioned   in   the   MLC  Ex.   PW8/A   and   PW11/A   can   also 

happen due to fall.   The site plan does not have signatures of any 

witness which means the same was prepared in the PS.  

</p><p id="p_6">6.                 Whereas the Ld. APP for the State argued that all the 

accused persons came to the house of injured Naresh and started 

beating him.     Accused Sauran hit a brick on the head of Naresh. 

The   accused   Meharban   hit   an   iron   rod   on   the   head   and   foot   of 

injured Ashish Kumar.   Accused Anish hit dandas on the back and 

hand  of   brother   of   accused   Ashish   Kumar   and  his  friend   Radhey 

was beaten up with rod by accused Bijender and Anish.  At the time 

of assaulting the injured persons, the accused persons were also 

accompanied by their factory labour.  The injured persons sustained 

injury and police rushed them to the hospital.  The doctors have also 

proved the MLCs of injured Radhey, Naresh, Ashish and Vipin.  As 

per x­ray report of injured Ashish Ex. PW9/A, there was a fracture 
                             nd
shaft of the left 2  metacarpal bone. There is also fracture of distal 

and middle phalanx of toe.  The danda, iron rod, and brick have also 

been  proved  as Ex.   P1 to  P3  respectively.    Further,   the accused 

persons   cannot   take   benefit   of   defective/   faulty   investigation. 

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">FIR No.  992/06; State Vs. Saurav Singh Etc.                             Page 5 of 26</span>
 Moreover,   the   evidence   of   hostile   witness   cannot   be   totally 

discarded. Ld. APP for the State, in support of his arguments, relied 

upon   the   judgments   reported   in   the   case   of  Paramjeet   Singh   @ 

Pamma Vs. State of Uttarakhanda, AIR 2011 SC 200; Dhanaj Singh 

alias Shera and others Vs. State of Punjab, AIR 2004 SC 1920 and 

Khujji alias Surendra Tiwari Vs. State of MP, 1991 CRI.L.J. 2653 (1). 

</p><p id="p_7">7.                 In   view   of   the   above   arguments   of   the   Ld.   Defence 

counsel and the Ld. APP for the State and the judgements relied 

upon by them, let us examine the evidence led in this case as to 

whether the accused persons committed the offence as per charges 

framed against them or whether they have been falsely implicated in 

this case.  PW1 HC Nempal Singh deposed that on 17­10­2006, he

witnessed the incident as he was on his duty.   DW1 also did not 

know as to who gave beatings to whom.  In her cross­examination, 

DW2 could not tell on which date, month and year she lastly visited 

the   house   of   Naresh.     DW2   in   her   cross­examination   could   not 

recollect whether she got mentioned in the complaint that Naresh 

was   holding   liquor   bottle   in   his   hand   and   he   was   consuming   the

 liquor.   DW3 in his cross­examination, deposed that he was sitting 

at the shop of Sauran Singh at the time of incident.  He was hit with 

a   chair   by   Naresh.     However,   DW3   did   not   make   any   complaint 

against Naresh to any authority or senior police official.  

</p><p id="p_19">19.                It   has   been   argued   by  Ld.   Defence   counsel   that   no 

public   witness   was   joined   during   investigation.     It   is   pertinent   to 

mention here that public persons are reluctant to become witnesses 

of criminal trial.  It has been held in a catena of judgements by the 

Hon'ble Supreme Court and Hon'ble High Court of Delhi that merely 

because public witnesses are not joined in a case, the Prosecution 

case cannot be thrown out.  In such circumstances, no benefit can 

be   given   to   the   accused   for   not   joining   of   independent   public 

witnesses.     In   this   context,   a   reliance   can   be   had   upon   the 

judgements reported as  State of UP Vs. Anil Singh AIR 1988 SC 

1998; Ambika Prasad &amp; Anr. Vs. State 2002 (2) Crimes 63 (SC); 

Dr. Krishna Pal &amp; Anr. Vs. State of UP 1996 (7) SCC 194.  There 

are some contradictions in the testimonies of PWs which are minor 

contradictions and the same do not go to the root of the case.   In 

this context, a reliance is placed upon the judgement reported as 

State of UP Vs. Krishna Master &amp; ors. 2010 Cri. L. J. 3889, it was 

held  by   the   Hon'ble  Supreme  Court  that   minor  discrepancies,   not

 touching core of case, cannot be ground for rejection of evidence in 

entirety.  Thus, it emerges from the evidence discussed above that 

the accused persons have caused injuries to Naresh, Ashish, Vipin, 

Radhey, and Mona.   The MLCs and x­ray of the injured have also 

been proved by the doctors/ PW7, PW8, PW9 and PW11. 

</p><p id="p_20">20.                It has emerged from the evidence as discussed above
