<p id="p_1">            Present revision petition is directed against the judgment dated

20.09.2018, whereby learned Sessions Judge, Bathinda, affirmed the

judgment of conviction and order of sentence dated 04.08.2007 passed by

learned Judicial Magistrate Ist Class, Phul, vide which the petitioner was

convicted under Section 61 (1)(C) of the Punjab Excise Act and was

sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of one year with

fine of Rs.5,000/- and in default of payment of fine to further undergo

rigorous imprisonment for one month.
</p>
<p id="p_2">2.          Facts relevant for the purpose of decision of the present case;

that on 31.07.2001 when ASI Jugraj Singh alongwith other police officials

was present at Bus Stand of village Khokhar, he received a secret

information that accused Gurmeet Singh was distilling illicit liquor by means

of working still near the passage of village Khokhar to Sood Chhiri near a

place Sidh Chhiri Baba Kalu Nath under the herd of trees. After joining

Nihal Singh son of Kehar Singh as an independent witness, the police party

raided at the said place and found the accused distilling illicit liquor by

means of working still. The still was cooled down and dismantled and

components of the still alongwith three quarter bottles of distilled illicit

liquor, one plastic Can containing three bottles of distilled illicit liquor and a

drum containing 20 kg partial lahan were recovered, which were taken into

police possession vide recovery memo Ex. P3. Accused was arrested and

site plan Ex. P4 of place of recovery was prepared. After completion of

investigation, challan was presented in the Court.

</p><p id="p_4">3.           During investigation, learned trial Magistrate completed various

proceedings of the trial including framing of charge against the petitioner-

accused, recording statements of prosecution witnesses, examination of

accused under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_1">Section 313</a> Cr.P.C. and after considering the prosecution

evidence and defence version, learned trial Court held the petitioner guilty

and convicted and sentenced him as narrated in para No.1 above.

</p><p id="p_5">4.           Being aggrieved of the passing of judgment of conviction and

order of sentence dated 04.08.2007, the petitioner preferred appeal before

the Court of Sessions, but the same was dismissed by learned Additional

Sessions Judge, Bathinda, vide judgment dated 20.09.2008 and the same

are now under challenge before this Court.
</p>
<p id="p_6">5.           At the very outset, learned counsel representing the petitioner

mainly contended that he does not challenge the judgment of conviction

and a lenient view on the point of sentence be taken as the petitioner has

already suffered much agony of law by facing protracted litigation for more

than 19 years and as per the custody certificate dated 29.04.2019, the

petitioner has already undergone total sentence of 02 months and 02 days

against the awarded sentence of One year. .
</p>
<p id="p_8">6.          Learned State counsel opposed this contention on the ground

that the petitioner was found to be in possession of working still and the

minimum sentence provided under Section 61 of the Act is Rigorous

Imprisonment for a period of one year and learned trial Judge has already

awarded the minimum sentence as provided under the Statute and there

are no grounds for interference on the point of sentence.

</p><p id="p_9">7.          Having considered the submissions made by learned counsel

for the parties and appraisal of record, this Court is of the considered view

that the prosecution case is based on the statements of PW-3 ASI Jagraj

Singh and PW-4 HC Joginder Pal, before whom the working still, 20 Kgs.

Lahan and 3, 1/4 bottles of illicit liquor and articles of working still were

recovered. The Investigating Officer of the case has also deposed the

same fact and both of them well stood by the test of cross-examination.

The other documentary evidence including Chemical report (Ex.P6),

recovery memo (Ex. P3) and Site plan (Ex. P4) are available on the file. In

his defence, the accused had examined four witnesses. The defence plea

is plea of denial as put forward in the statement of the accused. Learned

trial Court has rightly believed the prosecution evidence and discarded the

defence evidence. The same has been affirmed by learned first Appellate

Court and there are no grounds to set-aside the judgment of conviction.

recovery of working still for distillation of illicit liquor and the sentence

provided under Section 61 of the Act at the relevant time, i.e., date of

occurrence of the offence was imprisonment for a period of not less than

one year and fine of Rs.5,000/- and in default of payment of fine, one

month RI. As the learned trial Judge has already awarded the minimum

sentence provided under the Statute, no ground for interference is made

out.

and the same stands dismissed in toto.</p><pre id="pre_2">
