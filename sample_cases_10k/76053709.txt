     section 18 of the L. A. Act preferred by the petitioner against the
     respondents being aggrieved with quantum of compensation
     awarded by the LAC in lieu of acquisition of the land of petitioner.

</pre><p id="p_3">     22.08.2001 under <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_1">section 4</a> of LA Act, the land of the petitioner as
     mentioned in statement U/s 19 of L. A. Act, situated in the revenue
     estate of village Alipur, Delhi was acquired for the public purpose
     namely for the "Construction of 100 meter wide road in Narela
     Freight Complex Under PDD" by the Government and possession
     of the same was taken by Govt. The Land Acquisition Collector,
     after completing all the formalities as provided under the Act
     assessed the market value of total land.
</p><p id="p_4">  3. The reference petition U/s 18 of LAC Act was filed by petitioner
     wherein it was stated that vide above award, the land of the
     petitioner detailed in Statement U/s 19 of L. A. Act was acquired. It
     was pleaded in award that petitioner was the absolute owner as
     well as in cultivatory possession being exclusive owner of his share
     in said acquired land till date of taking over of possession of land.
     It was further stated that land of petitioner is leveled and was
     having most productivity and fertility power and is fit for growing
     three crops in a year. It was also stated that it was free from any
     kind of pit and depression and was fit for using as residential site
     or any industrial site. It was also stated that compensation
     awarded by Lac in respect of land acquired is highly inadequate
     and does not represent the prevailing market value as on the date
     of notification U/s 4 of L. A. Act. Some grounds were also raised in
     petition wherein it was pleaded that LAC has not adopted the
     correct method of valuation and while assessing the market value
     of land of petitioner, the LAC has completely ignored the potential
     value of land of petitioner. It was also averred that land in question
     has a very good residential and commercial potential value as a

LAC-48A/2015                                            Page:-2/7
      building site independent of several factors such as its condition
     and situation.   It was also stated that there cannot be same
     market value in the entire Delhi which runs in several hundred
     kilometers.   It was also averred that LAC has not taken into
     consideration the relevant sale transaction/sale purchase of land
     which is taking place in and around the land in question. Hence,
     present reference petition was filed by petitioner.
</p><p id="p_5">  4. In reply to reference petition, the respondent No. 1 Union of India
     had filed written statement wherein preliminary objections were
     raised stating that Delhi Land Reforms Act is applicable to the land
     in dispute and DDA is a necessary and proper party for the
     complete adjudication of instant proceedings.           It was further
     stated that LAC rightly assessed the market value of land keeping
     in view all the aspects enumerated U/s 23 &amp; 24 of <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_2">LA Act</a>. On
     merits, It was stated that LAC adopted the indicative price fixed by
     Govt. of NCT of Delhi as 15,70,000/- per acre for the category of
     land falling in 'Block A' and for Block B quality of land consisting
     Gadda of 3-4 feet was reduced by Rs. 1,70,000/- per acre as the
     land filling was required to be done and assessed the market value
     of Block B at Rs. 14,00,000/- per acre. It was stated that in
     reducing the value of land comprising in Block B the deduction in
     the previous award was considered and the same practice was
     also followed in the present award.     It was further averred that
     categorization of land was also done as per the due process of law
     and any objection thereto is also liable to be dismissed. It was
     also stated that petitioner is not entitled for any relief and
     reference petition be dismissed with heavy cost.
</p><p id="p_6">  5. Separate written statement was filed on behalf of DDA wherein

LAC-48A/2015                                               Page:-3/7
      preliminary objections were raised to the effect that amount
     awarded by LAC in the present case is adequate, sufficient, just
     and legal and there is no scope for enhancement of amount of
     compensation. It was also pleaded that present reference petition
     is barred by the period of limitation.   On merits, it was stated that
     land in question has been acquired and notification U/s 4 and 6
     has been issued and physical possession of land has been taken
     over by DDA on 12.12.2002 from LAC/L&amp;B and same has been
     transferred to RPD. II &amp; IV of DDA on 12.12.2002. It was also stated
     that compensation passed by LAC is legal, adequate, just and
     correct and the compensation has been awarded by the LAC after
     taking into consideration all the facts relevant for determining the
     compensation and as such the petitioner is not entitled for grant of
     enhancement of compensation. The other contents of reference
     petition were denied and it was prayed that present reference
     petition be dismissed with costs.

     order dated 29.05.2013:-

     compensation, if so to what amount?

      and closed the RE.
</p><p id="p_12">  9. I have gone through the record and have heard the arguments of
     parties. My findings are as under:-
</p><p id="p_13">  10.Issue     No.    1.   Whether    the   petitioner   is   entitled   to
     enhancement in compensation, if so to what amount?:- The
     onus to prove this issue was on the petitioner. Petitioner has
     contended that valuation of land determined by LAC is not
     reasonable as LAC has not adopted the correct method of
     valuation to fix the market value of land. The Ld. Counsel for the
     petitioner has relied upon the judgment passed by High Court in
     Jai Singh Vs. UOI LA Appeal No. 266/08 and connected matters
     dated 23.08.2011 in which the Hon'ble Judge has determined the
     market value of land pertained to village Alipur acquired through
     notification dated 22.08.2001 and same award as Rs. 16,74,500/-
     per acre for category 'A' land. Relevant observations in Jai Singh
     case are as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">                     "78. With reference to the notification dated
                     09.08.2001 wherein w.e.f. 01.04.2001 minimum price
                     notified per acre is Rs. 15.70 lakhs per acre and
                     requiring said price to be suitably updated to reach
                     the date of notification i.e. 22.08.2001 and with
                     reference to sale deed dated 25.05.2002 wherein for
                     Category 'C' lands, land price per acre comes to Rs.
                     17,74,109/-, rounded off to Rs. 17,75,000/- per acre,
                     and for Category 'B' lands increasing the same by
                     2.5% the price comes to Rs. 18.2 lakhs per acre and
                     further increasing by 2.5%, the prices comes to Rs.</blockquote>
<p id="p_14">                     18,65,500/- per acre for category 'A' lands; and
                     decreasing the said prices by 11% to reflect the price
                     with reference to the sale deed for the date
                     22.08.2001; the mean average price for category 'A'
                     lands in village Alipur comes to Rs. 16,74,500/- per
                     acre and decreasing the same by 2.5%, it comes to


LAC-48A/2015                                              Page:-5/7
                  Rs. 16,32,637.50 per acre for category 'B' lands.
                 Noting that the learned Reference court has, without
                 any reasons, done away with category 'B' lands and
                 uniform price awarded is Rs. 16,43,811/- per acre, the
                 price differential worked out by me comes to a
                 meager Rs. 9000/- per acre and thus qua category 'B'
                 lands I maintain the amount awarded by the learned
                 Reference Court."
</p>
<p id="p_15">  11. The land pertains to the notification dated 22.08.2001 and same
     award. Therefore, there is no ground to go differently then what
     the Hon'ble High Court of Delhi has held in Jai Singh case. The
     petitioner would be entitled to market value @ Rs. 16,74,500/- per
     acre as the land is of category 'A'.
</p><p id="p_16">  12. In view of the above, the issue no. 1 is decided as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">        i. Petitioner shall be entitled to enhance compensation
           @ Rs. 16,74,500/- per acre for the land mentioned in
