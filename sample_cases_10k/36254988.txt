ORDER :
</pre><p id="p_1">1.             The Appellants are aggrieved of the order dt. 20.05.2014
passed by Ms. Shefali Sharma, Ld. Civil Judge, North in suit No.
800/2013 titled as 'Mehnaz Vs. Nadeem &amp; Ors' whereby and whereunder
trial court had disposed off an application u/o 39 Rule 2 A of Civil
Procedure Code, 1908(in short 'CPC') filed by the plaintiff.
</p>
<p id="p_2">2.             For the sake of convenience parties shall be denoted as
they were before the Ld. trial court - the Appellants were the defendants
whereas respondent was the plaintiff.
</p>
<p id="p_3">3.             Trial court record has been summoned. The same has
been perused.
</p>
<p id="p_4">4.             The relevant facts culled out from the pleadings for the
disposal of this appeal are as under:-
</p>
<p id="p_5">i)             Defendant No. 1 and plaintiff are husband and wife
whereas other defendants are the relative of the plaintiff i.e. mother-in-
law, brother-in-law and sister-in-law, 'Jeth' and 'Nanad' respectively.
Plaintiff had filed a suit for permanent injunction claiming that defendants
should not create any hindrance in the peaceful living of the plaintiff in
the suit property and also the defendants be restrained from selling the
suit property/creating any third party interest in the suit property. The
suit property is a house bearing No. B-1206-1207, Bawana, Delhi.
</p>
<p id="p_6">       (I am only confining myself to the relief para sought in the plaint in
as much as it is the enforcement or breach of the injunction order in
reference to which the present appeal has been filed)


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">MCA No.10/14                                                       Page 2 of 11</span>
 ii.            Written statement was filed by the defendants.
</p>
<p id="p_7">iii.           The Ld. Trial Court vide order dt. 09.12.2013 had disposed
off the interim application and restrained the defendants from
dispossessing the plaintiff from the suit property and further restrained
them from selling the same without following due process of Law till the
pendency of the suit. The said order was not assailed by the defendants.
</p>
<p id="p_8">iv.            Thereafter, on 19.02.2014 an application u/o 39 Rule 2 A
CPC was preferred by the plaintiff. However, the said application was
not separately registered as miscellaneous application and it continued
in the suit file. Ld. Trial Court vide the same order had issued notice to
the SHO, P.S. Narela and sought for the status report.
</p>
<p id="p_9">v.             Reply was filed by the defendants in reference to the said
application and status report was also filed.
</p>
<p id="p_10">vi.            Thereafter, after hearing either side the impugned order
was passed. The impugned order/a part whereof needs to be noted
which is as under: -
</p>
<p id="p_11">       "6. From perusal of the status report filed by the SHO P.S. Narela
dt. 17.03.2014, i.e. after passing of the orders on the interim application,
it is evident that a lock has been put by the defendant No. 2 which was
the contention of the plaintiff. In the statements of witnesses recorded
by the police official it is categorically mentioned that there is only one
lock on the premises which belongs to the Rehana. The neigbours has
given their statement to the effect that of and on Rehana comes and
opens the said locks and resides there for 2 to 4 days. The defendant




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">MCA No.10/14                                                      Page 3 of 11</span>
 also admits in the reply to the application u/o 39 R 2-A CPC that the
plaintiff frequently visits the suit property.
</p>
<p id="p_12">7.     From the report submitted by the SHO it is clear that now a lock
has been put by the defendant despite orders dt. 09.12.2013 whereby
the defendants were restrained from dispossessing the plaintiff from the
suit premises. Thus, there an apparent violation and an act to render the
order of the Court infructuous by locking the premises and not letting the
entry of the plaintiff in the house where her goods are admittedly still
lying. Accordingly, the application u/o 39 R 2-A CPC of the plaintiff is
allowed. The defendants are bound to be careful in future and imposed
with a fine of Rs.10,000/- to be paid to the plaintiff. The defendants are
further directed to allow access of the suit premises to plaintiff. It is once
again directed that defendants are restrained from dispossessing the
plaintiff from the suit property or throwing away her articles without due
process of law and the concerned area SHO is directed to ensure the
compliance of this order. Let a copy of the order be sent to SHO P.S.
Narela.
</p>
<p id="p_13">       Matter be re-listed for replication and framing of issues on
02.08.2014."
</p>
<p id="p_14">5.             While the appeal was listed for admission, the defendants
were called upon to deposit the fine of Rs.10,000/- which they had
deposited by way of a banker cheque.
</p>
<p id="p_15">6.             The impugned order has been challenged primarily on the
reason that the suit property belonged to the mother-in-law of the
plaintiff, the present suit was filed once the mediation proceedings
between the parties could not succeed, the defendants had never

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">MCA No.10/14                                                        Page 4 of 11</span>
 dispossessed the plaintiff from the suit property and the articles of the
plaintiff were lying in the suit property qua which an affidavit was also
filed by the defendant No. 2 before the Ld. Trial Court. The yardstick
adopted by the Ld. Trial Court for concluding about the disobedience of
the injunction order i.e. solely relying upon the status report of the SHO
concerned without any insistence for production of any documents or
directing the parties to lead evidence was patently an illegal procedure ,
the outcome of which is not legally sustainable. Even the report of the
SHO concerned supported the defendants. The defendants had put their
lock only for securing the property in as much as at that point of time the
plaintiff was also out of town. No disobedience of the breach of the
injunction order was made out.
</p>
<p id="p_16">7.              Reply to the grounds of appeal has been filed on behalf of
respondent.
</p>
<p id="p_17">8.              Heard either side.
</p>
<p id="p_18">9.              Prior to proceeding further, it would be trite to note down
Order 39 Rule 2 A CPC:-
</p>
<p id="p_19">                2-A Consequence of disobedience or breach of injunction :
</p>
<p id="p_20">                (1) In the case of disobedience of any injunction granted or other
order made under rule 1 or rule 2 or breach of any of the terms on which the
injunction was granted or the order made, the Court granting the injunction or
making the order, or any Court to which the suit or proceeding is transferred,
may order the property of the person guilty of such disobedience or breach to
be attached, and may also order such person to be detained in the civil prison
for a term not exceeding three months, unless in the meantime the Court
directs his release."
</p>

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">MCA No.10/14                                                           Page 5 of 11</span>
<p id="p_21"> 10.            Now order 39 Rule 2 A CPC obviously is a remedy
prescribed for the purposes of securing the enforcement of the injunction
order or to prevent the breach of the same, the objective whereof is to
ensure that status quo ante is restored. The Court is vested with the
jurisdiction either to order for attachment of the property who had
disobeyed the injunction order or may also order for civil imprisonment of
the person flouting the same.
</p>
<p id="p_22">               Simultaneously   since   the   provision   prescribes   civil
imprisonment i.e. incarceration of a person and his liberty is curtailed
there must be cogent proof that injunction order has been violated or
breached. There cannot be any presumptive breach of injunction order
and this fact must like any other fact established by leading evidence
except in such cases when the breach is palpably evident can be
established by way of affidavits of the parties alone.
</p>
<p id="p_23">11.            Now that being the situation let me first evaluate as to on
what basis and material Ld. Trial Court had come to the conclusion that
the defendants had committed disobedience of the injunction order. As
observed earlier the injunction order was qua two aspects i.e. the
defendant should not dispossess the plaintiff from the suit property or
dispose off the same.      Viz-a-viz the dispossession only the dispute
remains in as much as there is no complaint by the plaintiff that the
property has been sold off.
</p>
<p id="p_24">12.            Now in this regard, the Ld. Trial Court had relied upon the
application U/o 39 Rule 2 A CPC and the reply whereof supported by the
affidavits of the parties and the report of the SHO concerned. I may also
note herein that the SHO was called to reply in pursuance of the order


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">MCA No.10/14                                                    Page 6 of 11</span>
 dt. 19.02.2014. He was not a party to the application u/o 39 Rule 2 A
CPC. Necessarily his response had to be in reference to the said order
only which was communicated to him. For the sake of convenience the
said order is as under: -
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">        " Present : Mr. Deepak Tyagi, counsel for plaintiff alongwith
                  plaintiff

               Mr. Javed Khan, Counsel for all the defendants.</blockquote>

<p id="p_25">               It is submitted on behalf of the plaintiff that despite the
application u/o 39 Rule 1 and 2 having been allowed vide orders dt.
09.12.2013 the defendants have wrongfully and without due process of
law dispossessed the plaintiff from the suit property on 04.01.2014 and
have put their lock on the suit premises. Accordingly, the application u/o
39 R 2 A CPC and another application u/s 151 CPC has been filed by
the plaintiff. Copies supplied. Let, the reply be positively filed by the
defendant by the next date of hearing. Let a status report be filed by the
concerned SHO P.S. Narela in this regard. Copy of this order alongwith
particulars of case be sent to the concerned SHO for necessary
information and compliance.

                                             ROHINI /19.02.2014



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">MCA No.10/14                                                      Page 7 of 11</span>
</p><p id="p_29"> 13.            Now the reply sought by the SHO or his response to the
allegations of the plaintiffs ought to have been communicated to him i.e.
a detailed para wise reply should have been sought for. The word 'status
report' is not used anywhere or employed in Civil Procedure Code. At the
most it could have been made a starting point for further enquiry or
determination of the controversy by calling the parties to lead evidence
but cannot be solely made the basis of reaching to a definite conclusion
about the guilt of the defendant. Any report sought from the police has
to be specific. A general or vague reply purportedly penned down by
police officials have no evidentiary value in the eyes of law. Thus, to my
mind, the status report cannot be taken as gospel truth while
adjudicating upon the allegations and counter allegations of either side.
At the cost of repetition, the point in issue directly involved was as to
whether defendants had dispossessed the plaintiff from the suit property
and whether that dispossession or ouster was complete or not to
conclude violation of the injunction order or not.
</p>
<p id="p_30">14.            The reading of the status report reveals that it was only a
general enquiry conducted by a police officer not in reference to the
aforesaid point in issue but only a sort of compilation of views of
neighbours in reference to the suit property. This status report therefore
has to be taken with a pinch of salt. The appropriate and safest course
of action in such a situation is to frame specific issues and ask parties to
lead evidence and thereafter, adjudge on the disobedience aspect. This
also affords the opposite party to test the version of the adversory by
way of cross-examination.
</p>
<p id="p_31">15.            Delving on the report i.e. the untainted part which only
pertains to the fact of lodging of DD entries by Rehama and the plaintiff

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">MCA No.10/14                                                      Page 8 of 11</span>
 herein. Now the DD entries are of the same date i.e. 04.01.2014 when
the incident occurred/as alleged by the plaintiff. Though the matter was
put to the notice of the police still the plaintiff had not approached the
Court with promptitude and this application was preferred on 19.02.2014.
Nothing prevented the plaintiff to approach the Court immediately as it
concerned about the fact that she was dispossessed from the suit
property.      She on the contrary has chosen to keep mum for a
considerable period of time and there is no explanation on this aspect
adduced by her. Now as per the status report the first DD entry i.e. DD
No. 24 A was loged at 01.05 afternoon by Rehana whereupon the same
was filed vide DD No. 74 B at about 8 p.m. in as much as she had
stated that her son had locked the suit property and accordingly, she
does not want any action. The second DD entry i.e. DD No. 47 A was at
8.34 p.m. It reveals that the locks of the suit property have been broken.
Thereafter the DD entry No. 29 B was lodged on 05.11.2014 which is
stated that no broken lock was found at the site. The said DD entry was
also filed. Mehnaz the complainant had called that the lock does not
belongs to her. (Probably it meant that the lock put on the door was not
put by her.)

</p><p id="p_32">16.     Now in this reference in the application u/o 39 Rule 2 A CPC the
version of the plaintiff is diametrically different. She states that she had
gone to Gokul Puri, Delhi by putting a lock over the premises. When she
returned back she saw one matador tempo in which the defendants were
sitting alongwith certain articles of hers. Further when she tried to open
the lock of the premises she found that the lock has been changed. She
was informed that her household articles have been taken by the
defendants. Now this incident as narrated suggest that she was forcibly


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">MCA No.10/14                                                      Page 9 of 11</span>
 dispossessed and a serious offence was committed by the defendants.
This aspect is however not at all revealed through the said DD entries.
This creates a doubt about the version of the plaintiff in as much as she
has improved upon her previous statement/information given to the
police and coined a new story.
</p>
<p id="p_33">17.            Thus,     to   my   mind,   the   status   report   even    the
unimpeachable part whereof i.e. DD entries also does not support the
case of the plaintiff.
</p>
<p id="p_34">18.            It further needs no gain saying that when parties are
embroiled in a matrimonial litigation they can go to any extent to damage
or harass the adversory who obviously is known to them - to vent their
venom - the urge to defeat other over powers their senses and they just
want to cause financial and physical loss to the opposite party. It is
therefore, important that the right to cross-examine each other should be
made available.
</p>
<p id="p_35">19.            The impugned order is therefore, liable to be set aside for
discussion as mentioned hereinabove. Further in addition thereto Order
39 Rule 2 A CPC prescribes either attachment of goods and or civil
imprisonment. It does not speak of any fine. It is not a penal provision .
Thus, to my mind the order of imposition of fine of Rs.10,000/- upon the
defendants also without any jurisdiction. The further fact as to how that
sum of Rs.10,000/- has been reached has also not been substantitated
in the impugned order. Fine is a stigma a sort of penalty whereas<a href="/doc/1645922/" id="a_1"> Civil
Procedures Code</a> speaks of costs. Thus, the imposition of fine is also
without jurisdiction.
