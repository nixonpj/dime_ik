Heard on : May 6, 2010

Judgment on : May 6, 2010

</pre><p id="p_4">        The Court : The petitioner in this <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1">art.226</a> petition dated April 1, 2010 is
alleging that Paltagarh Radharani Sikshamandir in Singur of the district Hooghly
has wrongfully refused to admit his son to Class V.
</p><p id="p_5">        The petitioner's son was studying at Paltagarh Radharani Sikshamandir
(Primary Section). He took the Class IV Final Examination and passed it. He
was free to take admission to Class V of the secondary section of the school. The
authority of the secondary section notified the following admission programme:
distribution of forms: 15.2.10-17.2.10; submission of forms: 18.2.10-20.2.10;
submission     of   admission    fees:   22.2.10-23.2.10;   submission   of   transfer
certificate: 2.3.10.
</p><p id="p_6">        The petitioner collected admission form, and filled in and submitted it
within time, but did not deposit the admission fee and submit the transfer
certificate. From the transfer certificate issued by the headmaster of the primary
section of the school it is evident that it was issued on March 1, 2010, and hence
it was quite possible for the petitioner to submit it on March 2, 1010 according to
the notified admission programme.
</p><p id="p_7">        It is submitted that as many as 180 students took admission to Class V of
the school according to the admission programme, but that the petitioner's son,
taking admission test conducted by one Singur Mahamaya High School, awaiting
results of the test, was not interested in taking admission to Class V of the
secondary section of the school. The admitted position is that for undisclosed
 reasons admission fee was not deposited and the transfer certificate was not
submitted within the time mentioned in the admission programme.
</p><p id="p_8">        Counsel submits that the petitioner approached the headmaster of the
secondary section of the school on March 2, 2010, but that the headmaster
refused to accept the transfer certificate.     I find no reason to believe the
petitioner's case that he met the headmaster of the school on March 2, 2010 and
wanted to submit the transfer certificate.
</p><p id="p_9">        His first representation to the school is dated March 13, 2010, Annexure
P4 at p.20. In the representation he did not say that he met the headmaster of
the school on March 2, 2010 and wanted to submit the transfer certificate.
</p><p id="p_10">        If he actually met the headmaster on March 2, 2010, then he would have
definitely stated so in the representation and he would not have waited till March
13, 2010 to make a grievance for the first time. An ordinary man would have
reacted to the situation on March 2, 2010 itself and in any case within a day or
two thereafter. The petitioner's own conduct is sufficient to conclude that he did
not approach the headmaster of the institute on March 2, 2010 for submission of
the transfer certificate.
</p><p id="p_11">        Since the petitioner did not take steps for admission of his son according
to the notified admission programme, I am unable to hold that the school
authority wrongfully refused to admit his son to Class V. That the son did well in
Class IV, is of no consequence.
</p><p id="p_12">        I cannot ignore the submission made by counsel for the school that there
are many similarly situated students who did not take steps for admission
according to the admission programme, and that if an order is made directing the
school to admit the petitioner's son now, then the consequences will be quite
chaotic.
</p><p id="p_13">        For these reasons, the petition is dismissed.   No costs. Certified xerox.
</p>
