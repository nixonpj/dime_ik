                                Order
25/01/2017

             This writ petition has been filed by the petitioners

challenging order dated 11.02.2016 passed by the Board of Revenue,

Ajmer(for sort 'the Board of Revenue') whereby revision petition filed

by the petitioner has been rejected and order dated 09.01.2014

passed by the Assistant Collector and Executive Magistrate(Second),

Sikar(for short 'the Assistant Collector') directing removal of the wall

constructed by the petitioner on the disputed land, has been

confirmed.
                                    (2 of 4)
                                                               [CW-5691/2016]

            Respondent No.1 filed a revenue suit for declaration and</pre>

<p id="p_1">permanent injunction under Section 88 of the Rajasthan Tenancy

Act(for short 'the Act'). The Court below during pendency of the suit

appointed a commissioner for site inspection on the application moved

by Respondent No. 1, who inspected the site on 11.09.2008 and

prepared a report and sent the same to the Assistant Collector. The

court below vide order dated 02.08.2007 passed an ex-parte interim

order directing that no obstruction would be caused in possession and

cultivation of the respondent no.1.           Thereafter, vide order dated

14.02.2011 temporary injunction application was decided finally

directing that status quo with regard to land bearing Khasra No. 447,

448, 451 shall be maintained. Thereafter, respondent no. 1 filed an

application alleging that the petitioner made a wall on the way used by

them despite there being stay order in operation. The petitioner filed

reply to that application denying the averments made therein. The

Assistant   Collector   vide   order   dated     09.01.2014   allowed   the

application of Respondent No.1 and directed removal of the wall in

dispute. Being aggrieved, the petitioner filed revision petition before

the Board of Revenue which was dismissed vide impugned order dated

11.02.2016.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">            Learned counsel for the petitioner argued that report was

prepared by the Site Commissioner with a view to collect the

evidence, which is not permissible under the law and the said report

was prepared in absence of the petitioner. Respondent No.1 on one

hand filed application under Section 151 CPC and on the other hand,

contempt petition has also been filed by him.         When the contempt

petition was filed before filing of the aforesaid application, the said
                                       (3 of 4)
                                                                   [CW-5691/2016]

application could not be maintained.             Alleged boundary wall was

already in existence before filing of the revenue suit. If any path is

blocked, separate remedy has been provided under the law.                  The

prayer in the said suit and injunction application was confined to land

of Khasra No. 447, 448 and 451, therefore, the wall constructed on

the land of Khasra No. 453 could not be taken as breach of injunction

order. Learned counsel argued that provisions of Section 151 CPC are

not applicable to the proceedings to the revenue suit because it is

tried under the provisions of the Act.           It is, therefore, prayed that

present writ petition may be allowed and impugned orders may be

quashed and set aside.
</p>
<p id="p_4">
</p><p id="p_5">              Having heard learned counsel for the petitioners and

perused the material on record, this Court finds that the Assistant

Collector vide order dated 02.08.2007 directed that no obstruction

would be caused in possession and cultivation of the respondent no.1.

Thereafter,    vide   order   dated     14.02.2011     temporary    injunction

application was decided finally directing that the parties to maintain

status quo with regard to land bearing Khasra No. 447, 448 and 451

situated at Tan Sabalpura as also the record and the petitioners

blocked the way after passing of aforesaid order, which is apparent

from report of Tehsildar dated 03.10.2008 wherein it has been

mentioned that there is a way existing on land of Khasra No. 453

since 40-50 years which is way to the land of Khasra No. 447, 448

and 451 and it has been blocked by constructing a wall on it two

months ago, which is creating obstruction to the respondent no.1 in

cutting his crops and as per provisions of law, no change could be

made with regard to the land on which there is already an status quo
                                  (4 of 4)
                                                             [CW-5691/2016]

order in operation.   Land of Khasra No. 453 was specifically been

included in Clauses (c) and (d) of the prayer clause of the plaint. The

Board of Revenue in its order dated 11.02.02016 has reiterated the

aforesaid facts and observed that since the petitioners have changed

the condition of the land in question which has caused obstruction in

public way and the court below which has passed interim order has to

see that it's order is not flouted in any way, which has exactly been

done by the court below in this case. This Court is also of the opinion

that order dated 09.01.2014 has rightly been passed by the Assistant

Collector and the Board of Revenue has rightly not interfered with the

same and dismissed the revision petition filed by the petitioners.
