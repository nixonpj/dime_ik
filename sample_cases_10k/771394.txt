</p><p id="p_2">             2. The brief case of the prosecution which

has resulted on the basis of Fardbayan (Exhibit-4) of

Kusmi Devi (P.W.4) which was recorded by Sub-

Inspector of Police Nandu Sharma (P.W.10) on 22nd

September, 1986 at 10.30 A.M. at village Mohanpur was
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">              3</span>




that her husband Rameshwar Mandal (deceased of the

present case) and son were accused in a case of murder.

In that case her husband (deceased) was enlarged on bail

one year prior to the occurrence. Informant was requiring

money for the litigation. Her husband (the deceased) had

talked about with villager Suresh Mandal (P.W.5) for

selling the land. The informant's husband set out for

Bhagalpur along with the informant, Suresh Mahto

(P.W.5), Babu Lal Mandal (P.W.3), Nesraj Lal Mandal

(P.W.1) and Saryug Mandal (P.W.2). While they were

proceeding and reached at about 5.30 A.M. south of

village at Pir Asthan Talab Imli then from Arhar field

accused Naresh Paswan, Ramchel Paswan, Dasrath

Paswan and Bidya Thakur came out.          At that time,

appellant Naresh Paswan having country made double

barrel gun whereas appellants Dasrath Paswan and

Ramchel Paswan having country made pistols and

appellant Bidya Thakur armed with Lathi surrounded the

deceased and others and threatened them not to raise

alarm. In the meanwhile, appellants Bhudeo Paswan and

Hardeo Paswan having pistols also assembled and started
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">              4</span>




dragging the informant's husband and they took the

informant's husband to the east side in the filed of Arhar.

At that place the informant saw that Naresh Paswan put

his double barrel gun upon the chest of the informant's

husband and fired. The informant and others ran towards

south that is towards the village. On cry the accused

person escaped towards south east.       When informant

came and returned to the Arhar field of Chamru Yadav

she found her husband dead having one fire arm injury.

The motive behind the occurrence was that one and half

years earlier Chaukidar Ramrup Paswan was killed and in

connection with that killing the informant's husband and

her two sons were suspected.     The informant's husband

was released on bail one year prior to the occurrence.

After being released from jail he was residing in village

Mamlakha.        Accused Naresh Paswan was hurling

constant threat. In the morning the accused persons got

opportunity and eliminated the husband of the informant

(P.W.4). The first information report was registered    on

22nd September, 1986 at 5.30 A.M. and case vide

Jagdishpur P.S. Case no. 126 dated 22.09.1986 was
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">               5</span>




registered under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_6">Section 302</a>/<a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_7">34</a> of the Indian Penal Code

and investigation was taken up.          After investigation

charge sheet was submitted and the case was committed

to the Court of Session where charges under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_8">section 302</a>

/<a href="/doc/999134/" id="a_9">149</a> of the Indian Penal Code were framed against

Naresh Paswan, Dasrath Paswan, Bhudeo Paswan,

Hardeo Paswan,      Bidya Thakur and Ramchel Paswan

and charge under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_10">Sections 302</a> and <a href="/doc/763672/" id="a_11">148</a> of the Indian

Penal Code was framed against Naresh Paswan, Dasrath

Paswan, Bhudeo Paswan, Hardeo Paswan, Bidya Thakur

and Ramchel Paswan.          Against Naresh Paswan charge

was under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_12">Section 302</a> of the Indian Penal Code

separately.
</p>
<p id="p_3">              3. The defence of the accused persons was

that the occurrence was not witnessed by any person and

the story of going to Lailakh station via place of

occurrence    was    false     because    of   the   various

circumstances.    People come to place of occurrence

where there is a pond for the purpose of easing. In fact,

Rameshwar Paswan was there for the purpose of easing.

When he was killed by some unknown then the informant
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                6</span>




thought it proper to implicate her enemies. Nobody had

gone to the Police Station to inform the case because

nobody was knowing about the accused persons. In the

case no independent witness has appeared on behalf of

the prosecution. The story of going to Lailakh station

have been concocted because the place of occurrence was

east of the village and the only way to go to Bhagalpur is

via Goradih which is west of the village.
</p>
<p id="p_4">               4. In order to prove its case the prosecution

has examined ten witnesses. They are P.W.1, Nesraj Lal

Mandal, P.W.2, Saryug Mandal, P.W.3, Babulal Mandal,

P.W.4, informant Kusmi Devi, P.W.5, Suresh Mandal,

P.W.6, Dr. Kailash Jha, P.W.7, Parsuram Mandal, P.W.8,

Ganesh Prasad Mandal, P.W.9, Umesh Prasad Sharma

and P.W.10, Investigating Officer Nandu Sharma. P.Ws

1 to 5 are the material witnesses of the occurrence and

they have claimed themselves as eye-witnesses. P.W.6

has conducted the post mortem examination on the dead

body and prepared the post mortem examination report

(Exhibit-1).
</p>
<p id="p_5">               5. P.W.6, Dr. Kailash Jha, has conducted
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">              7</span>




the post mortem examination of the dead body of

Rameshwar Mandal which was brought by Constable

Dinesh Paswan (not examined) and Chaukidar (not

examined) on 23.09.1986. According to the doctor the

deceased was aged about 60 years and he was having the

following ante mortem injuries:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">             (i) Abrasion and laceration 2" x 1" on
    right palm posteriori at metacarop-phalangial
    joint.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">             (ii) Abrasions both sides of chest near
    nipple; the size of abrasion on right side 2" x 1"
    and the size of left side abrasion 1 ½ " x 1". The
    abrasion on the left side was medial to nipple.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">             (iii) Oval 1" x ¾" fire arm wound of
    entry on left side chest one inch lateral to sternum
    and 2 ½ "          above left nipple with charred
    margin; upside down the projectile passed and
    lacerated left lung, pericardial and left auricale.
    Blood in chest cavity 2 pints was found. Pellets
    and wad of cardboard were recovered from lung
    posterior wall and mediasterum. There was
    fracture third rib interiorly and fourth rib
    posteriorly near mid line left side. The heart was
    empty. Right lung was pale. The other visceras
    were also pale. Stomach and bladder were empty.
    Meninges and brain vessels had less of blood.</blockquote><p id="p_6">

</p><p id="p_7">              6. Injuries no.(i) and (ii) were caused by

hard and blunt substance and ante-mortem injury no.(iii)

was caused by fire arm.
</p>
<p id="p_8">              7. The death of Rameshwar Mandal was

caused by fire arm has not been challenged and the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">               8</span>




prosecution has been able to prove that Rameshwar

Mandal was killed by fire arm.
</p>
<p id="p_9">              8. Now it has to be judged as to whether the

prosecution has been able to prove      that the death of

Rameshwar Mandal was caused by the appellants or not.

The most important witness of the case is P.W.4, who is

the informant. P.W.3 has already been disbelieved by the

trial court. P.W.4, in her evidence, has stated that on one

Monday morning she was proceeding with Saryug Mandal

(P.W.2), Babu Lal Mandal (P.W.3), Suresh Mandal

(P.W.5), Nesraj Lal Mandal (P.W.1) and her husband and

they were going to Bhagalpur court. When they arrived at

Pir Asthan then accused Naresh Paswan, Ramchel

Paswan, Dasrath Paswan and Bidya Thakur intercepted

and encircled them. At that time Naresh Paswan was in

possession of the country made gun whereas Dasrath

Paswan and Ramchel Paswan were in possession of the

pistol. Bidya Thakur was having a lathi. Her evidence

states that her husband was caught by Ramchel Paswan

and Dasrath Paswan and he was pushed to the Arhar field

by Naresh Paswan and Bidya Thakur. The informant and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">               9</span>




others followed.    When the informant's husband was

carried to some distance in the field then from the east side

Hardeo Paswan and Budeo Paswan came, they were also

having pistol. All the six accused dragged the informant's

husband to Arhar field. In the way Rameshwar Mandal

fell down but he was dragged and inside Arhar field

Naresh Paswan fired as a result thereof Rameshwar

Mandal fell down and thereafter all the accused persons

escaped. Thus, if the description of the occurrence by the

informant is compared from the first version of the

informant which was lodged there, her fardbayan make

some addition. There was no mention in the fardbayan

that Rameshwar mandal was caught also by Ramchel

Paswan and Dasrath Paswan had caught the informant's

husband and he was pushed in the Arhar field where

others also arrived. That is enhancement of the version

given by the informant in the fardbayan which was

recorded after about five hours of the occurrence. The

relationship has been described by her and she has stated

that when her husband was released from the jail then he

was residing at village Mamlakha.          That version is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">              10</span>




mentioned in the first informantion report. But she has

contradicted this version in her evidence (paragraph 5)

when she says that after release her husband was not

residing at Mamlakha rather her husband was residing at

Mohanpur.     She has denied that she has made her

statement in the fardbayan that after release her husband

was living in Mamlakha and the fardbayan mentions that

the informant, in her fardbayan, has stated categorically

that after her husband was released from Jail in the murder

case then he was residing in village Mamlakha.

Therefore, these two statements are quite contradictory.

</p><p id="p_10">              9. P.Ws 1 to 5 are alleged eye-witnesses of

the occurrence.   They have come before the court to

support. It was Pointed out that the story that the victim

and others were going to Lailakh station is not mentioned

in the fardbayan. This was later on developed. But, it has

been argued that for going to Bhagalpur nobody was

required to go towards east of the village. P.W.1 states in

his evidence that he and others were going to Bhagalpur

and when they reached near the Imli Pir Asthan then

fardbayan was recorded. He stated that Goradih is west of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">               11</span>




village Mohanpur and situated two miles away and there is

Pucca road.    Bus and other vehicles were frequently

available from Bhagalpur to Goradih. He further states in

his evidence that the distance of Mohanpur to Mamlakh is

four to five miles.    Therefore, it was submitted that

ordinary person is not required to go to Mamlakh for

going to Bhagalpur. The convenient road is via Goradih

which consumes lesser time in the journey. It has also

been submitted that Investigating Officer has supported

this fact that mode of conveyance     is also available for

going to Bhagalpur from Goradih (P.W.10, paragraph 17).

No doubt, a person has choice to chose his way but if

shorter or convenience distance is available then one will

take up that way. According to the Investigating Officer

the vehicle is always available for a person of Mohanpur

for going to Bhagalpur from Goradih which was situated

at about two miles. There appears no reason as to why the

informant and others chose to go a distance of five miles

for catching the train which was not frequently available.

However, this is not very important aspect of the case.

</p><p id="p_11">              10. About relationship it has come that
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">              12</span>




P.Ws 1, 2, 3 and 5 belong to one family (P.W.2 -

paragraph 4). P.Ws 1 and 2 were convicted (Exhibit-A)

which was a case of crop cutting. It has come in their

evidence that Chaukidar Ramrup Paswan was associated

with Goshala and he was a witness in the case which has

resulted in Exhibit-A. P.Ws. 1 and 2 have denied the

suggestion that they were ever convicted.          (P.W.2-

Paragraph 5 and P.Ws 3 and 4 - paragraph-1). The copy

of the judgment is on the record which shows that they

were convicted though granted benefit of <a href="/doc/1127741/" id="a_13">Section 4</a> of the

provision of Offenders' Act.       No doubt, they were

convicted but their sentence was to the extent that they

were released in terms of <a href="/doc/1127741/" id="a_14">Section 4</a> of the provision of

Offenders' Act. In the flat denial of P.Ws 1 and 2 that

they were not at all convicted in any case goes to show

that they were not true and genuine persons. No doubt, on

this score only their evidence cannot be discredited but

those two witnesses were deposing before the Court on

oath. They could have stated that they were released after

execution of bond but their flat denial that they were ever

convicted in any other case impinges their credibility as
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">               13</span>




true persons and true witnesses of the case. This creates

further compounded that they had enmity with the

appellants from before.       The husband and sons of

informant had remained in jail in the case of crop cutting

(Exhibit-A) and the accused persons were the prosecution

witnesses. In this view of the matter, the evidence of

P.Ws 1 and 2 are not credit worthy and it does not inspire

confidence. The defence case of the prosecution is that

when there was hue and cry then many villagers have

assembled. This fact has been stated by almost all the

witnesses who have been examined by the prosecution. If

list of witnesses of the present case is scanned then it will

be evident that no independent witness has been relied

upon or brought by the prosecution who could have

supported any part of the occurrence or any fact after the

occurrence. There is specific case of the witness that the

matter was reported soon after the occurrence to Sarpanch.

The Sarpanch, thus, become an important witness who

could have been examined but the prosecution has kept

mum as to why that witness was not examined. Non-

examination of any independent witness itself create doubt
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">              14</span>




as to veracity of the entire prosecution case. No doubt, the

prosecution eye-witnesses are independent witnesses are

not necessary in all case but if the prosecution case with a

version regarding existence of independent witnesses then

the onus was upon the prosecution to bring them to state

the facts before the Court because in the present case the

enmity has already been established.        Therefore, the

motive was present for implication of the accused also.

Motive is a double edged weapon and the independent

witnesses could have unfolded this fact that the informant

and witnesses immediately after the witness has found

regarding killing. Next course of the independent witness

that the occurrence was immediately reported to the

independent witness.      It has come in evidence that

Jagdishpur is at a distance of six miles from the place of

occurrence, nobody has gone to the Police Station to

inform about the occurrence.     The Police, on its own,

came on some information which resulted in Sanha diary

entry no. 419 dated 22.09.1986. That Sanha entry is not

on the record.     The personal diary of the Investigating

Officer is also not on record.   The Police has come after
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">              15</span>




five hours of the occurrence. Production of Sanha diary or

personal diary of the Investigating Officer could have

shown as to what information was received by P.W.10.

Those could have shown as to when the information was

received, when the Investigating Officer proceeded and

when he reached. Though P.W.3 has been disbelieved but

he,   in paragraph 6 of his statement, has stated that

Investigating Officer has come to the place of occurrence

in the after-noon that is at about 2.00 P.M. If this part of

the evidence is considered then it makes the entire

implication suspicious.
</p>
<p id="p_12">              11. Another fact which has come on record

that the fardbayan shows that Kusum Devi gave her

fardbayan at village Mohanpur and not in any Bahiar or

near the dead body.       P.W.4, who is the informant, in

paragraph 3, has stated that when she was going after the

occurrence towards the villagers along with P.W.2 then

she has given her fardbayan. She denied in her evidence

that her fardbayan was recorded at Mohanpur rather she

has stated that her fardbayan was recorded at some other

place that is at Pir Asthan. The Investigating Officer has
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">               16</span>




stated that he has recorded fardbayan at Mohanpur and not

at any other place. Therefore, place where fardbayan was

recorded has remained vague. It is not the definite place

where fardbayan was recorded.
</p>
<p id="p_13">              12. Another reason of prosecution doubted

by the defence is that the murder was years earlier. With a

lapse of time could have diminished the enmity.         The

occurrence had taken place four years earlier. Rameshwar

Mandal was on bail since one year. Nothing has happened

though witnesses had stated that accused persons was

threatening Rameshwar Mandal but nothing is on the

record as to why this matter was not reported to the Police

when he was being threatened by the accused persons.

The defence has cross-examined the informant, P.W. 4, as

to whether she has ever informed about the threatening to

the Sarpanch or any other person then she answered in

negative. Exhibit-5, that is inquest report, show     that an

underwear was present near the place of occurrence. This

has been mentioned in the inquest report. If a person was

being dragged in the field later on he was killed, then there

was a possibility that his underwear might have taken out.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">               17</span>




From presence of Dhoti, which he was wearing, shows

that the underwear was not taken from Rameshwar

Mandal because his Dhoti was intact. This is taken from

the seizure list. It gave credence to the defence version

that the deceased might have gone to ease because in the

early morning persons use to go for easing and in that

manner he might have been killed. The existence of the

underwear is not in conformity with the prosecution

version that the victim was taken towards Arhar field

where he was killed.       The alleged occurrence was

witnessed by a number of persons but nobody has even

uttered that underwear of Rameshwar Mandal was taken

out from him. It shows that actual occurrence has not

been witnessed by any of the witnesses though there are

five witnesses but they have not explained as to why this

underwear was available.     The existence of underwear

shows something fishy and the inference from that goes

that the prosecution is not coming with true version of the

occurrence.
</p>
<p id="p_14">              13. Learned counsel for the appellants has

submitted that in view of the fact that P.Ws 1 and 2 have
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">               18</span>




lied before the court. Their evidence is not fit to be relied

upon. Not only that all the material witnesses of the case

are interested witness and they have come to falsely

implicate   the    appellants   and   also   there   is   fatal

contradiction in materially true and the prosecution case is

fit to be dismissed. On the other hand, learned counsel for

the State submitted that the prosecution has been able to

prove the charge that killing was by the appellants.       We

have perused the evidence and related papers and we have

heard the submissions. We fail to understand as to why

independent witnesses have been left though their

presence have been stated by the Police. P.Ws. 1 and 2

cannot be relied because they have not come with true

version.    The place of fardbayan has also not been

explained. There was no motive at all to carry a person to

some distance and there he was killed. There is nothing

mentioned that any associate was there at the place where

Rameshwar Mandal was going and at that time there was

no obstruction and he might have been killed there itself.

Therefore, there is no explanation as to why he was

carried to some distance.       Another fatal defect in the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">                 19</span>




prosecution case is registration of the first information

report on 22nd September, 1986 but it was sent to the court

on 24th September, 1986. This delay itself lends credence

to the defence version that, in fact, the occurrence was in

different manner and the fardbayan was given after due

deliberation.        Considering the facts and circumstances,

we are of the view that the prosecution has not been able

to prove the charges beyond reasonable doubt. Where

doubt is created then the benefit goes in favour of the

defence, namely, the appellants.
</p>
<p id="p_15">                14. In the result, the judgment of conviction

is set aside. The appeals are allowed. The appellants are

discharged from the liabilities of their bail bonds.
