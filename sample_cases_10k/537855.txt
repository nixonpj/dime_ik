                        ANTONY DOMINIC, J.
                      ================
                  W.P.(C) NO. 31387 OF 2009 (P)
                  =====================

           Dated this the 4th day of November, 2009

                           J U D G M E N T
</pre>

<p id="p_1">      Petitioners are retired Engineers of PWD, having retired in

the years 1991, 1992 and 1999 respectively. By Ext.P5 order

dated 1/6/2009, liability has been fastened on the petitioners and

it is ordered that the same shall be recovered by filing Civil Suit

against the petitioners.       It is challenging this order the writ

petition is filed.
</p>
<p id="p_2">      2.    It is pointed out that another person, who is also

affected by Ext.P5, had challenged the said order by filing WP(C)

No.28301/09. That writ petition was disposed of by Ext.P6

judgment dated 8th October, 2009, in which Ext.P5 herein has

been referred to as Ext.P4. The directions issued are contained in

para 4 of the judgment, which is extracted below for reference:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">        In my view, Ext.P4 order can only be treated as a
        decision taken by the Government to recover the loss
        allegedly caused to them on account of alleged inaction
        on the part of the petitioner and the other delinquent
        officials. Ext.P4 by itself cannot be treated as the basis
        for recovery of any amount from the petitioner, by way
        of alleged loss caused by the petitioner. It can only be
        treated as a deliberation of the Government and if the
        appropriate competent authority files a Civil Suit
        against the petitioner for recovery of the loss, then it
        will obviously be open to the petitioner to resist the

WPC 31387/09
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                   :2 :</span>



        plea for recovery as also defend any action for recovery
        of any damages from the petitioner. The finding in
        Ext.P4, cannot by itself be treated as the basis for any
        action for recovery. It is upto the Government to prove
        the loss caused to them and then seek recovery of
        amounts from the delinquent officials by way of
        damages. If this aspect is clarified, then it is obvious
        that the petitioner cannot consider himself as aggrieved
        merely by Ext.P4 since it is open to him to defend any
        such action as and when the Government files a Suit for
        recovery of any amounts, by way of damages against
        the petitioner.</blockquote><p id="p_3">

</p><p id="p_4">      In view of the fact that the order challenged in that writ

petition is the one challenged in this writ petition, this writ petition

is also disposed of directing that the petitioners herein will also be

entitled to the benefit of the directions in para 4 of the judgment

extracted above.
