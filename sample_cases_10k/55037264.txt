              The High Court of Madhya Pradesh
                      Bench at Gwalior

SINGLE BENCH
                        : (Vivek Agarwal, J.)
                    Writ Petition No. 1763/2009
                       Smt. Anjul Kushwaha
                                  Vs.
                             State of M.P.


                 Whether approved for reporting :
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shri K.B. Chaturvedi, learned senior counsel with Shri G.P.
Chaurasiya, learned counsel for the petitioner.
Shri Harish Dixit, learned Govt. Advocate for the respondent/State.
Shri R.S. Rathore, learned counsel for respondent No. 5.
                           JUDGMENT
</pre><p id="p_1">                            (01.02.2018)
      Petitioner has filed this petition being aggrieved by order dated
13.03.2009 passed by Commissioner, Chambal Division, Morena,
whereby appeal filed by the private respondent- Smt. Neelam
Rathore has been accepted and the appointment order as Anganwadi
Karyakarta issued through the order of the Collector in favour of the
present petitioner, who was respondent No. 1 before the Court of
Commissioner, has been set aside.
</p><p id="p_2">2.    Petitioner's contention is that the petitioner belongs to BPL
category as can be seen from Ration Card (Annexure P/5) in which
her name is mentioned alongwith her sister-in-law (Nanad) Rajabeti.
Further reliance has been placed on affidavit (Annexure P/5-A) in
which the petitioner depicted herself as         a deserted woman and
mentioned in the affidavit that for last one year her husband is
torturing her and, therefore, she is a deserted woman. Third ground is
that petitioner has certificates of teaching 16 persons as Guruji as
                                                      WP No. 1763/2009
              The High Court of Madhya Pradesh
                      Bench at Gwalior

contained in Annexure P/9 and another certificate from Govt.
Primary School, Lahari, Bhind showing herself as Voluntary Teacher
who worked from 01.10.2006 to 30.04.2007. The petitioner has also
enclosed copy of one certificate as Anganwadi Karyakarta as
contained in Annexure P/17, wherein it has been shown that the
petitioner worked as Anganwadi Karyakarta w.e.f. 10.11.2008 to
09.12.2008. Placing reliance on such certificates, petitioner submits
that in terms of the scheme of appointment of Anganwadi Karyakarta
petitioner should have been granted 10 marks for BPL card holder, 10
marks for being a deserted woman and 10 marks for her experience
as Guruji/Anganwadi Karyakarta/teaching experience in primary
school. The fourth ground which has been taken by the petitioner is
in regard to limitation that private respondent No. 5 had not filed the
appeal before the Commissioner within the prescribed period of
limitation, which has been shown to be 10 days in the policy
(Annexure P/2) and therefore, the appeal was barred by time and
such appeal should not have been entertained by the Commissioner.
In support of this ground, learned counsel for the petitioner has
placed reliance on the judgment of Supreme Court in the case of
Ragho Singh Vs. Mohan Singh reported in (2000)2 MPWN 267,
wherein it has been held that if there is no application for
condonation filed and appeal is barred by limitation, then the
limitation cannot be condoned in the absence of such application for
condonation of delay.
</p><p id="p_3">3.    Learned counsel for the petitioner has also taken this Court
through the representation which was made by her to the Project
Officer as is contained in Annexure P/13 dated 15.09.2007. This
representation addressed to the Project Officer reveals that she had
sought marks on two grounds namely; 10 marks for being a BPL card
holder and 10 marks for her experience as a teacher (Shishu Didi
                                                        WP No. 1763/2009
               The High Court of Madhya Pradesh
                       Bench at Gwalior

Padhna Badhna Anubhav), however, she had not claimed any mark
for being a deserted woman in the representation which was filed
before the Project Officer. This was the first representation made by
the petitioner against the Provisional Select List issued by the
respondent.
</p><p id="p_4">4.      It is petitioner's contention that since the representation was
not decided by the Project Officer and he had issued an appointment
order in favour of respondent No. 5 Ku. Neelam Rathore on
25.10.2007, therefore, the petitioner had filed an appeal before the
Collector, Bhind which has been decided vide order dated
18.09.2008 (Annexure P/15).
</p><p id="p_5">5.      This appeal has been decided by Collector only on the sole
ground that the petitioner is a deserted woman and therefore, if 10
marks would have been granted to her she would get 43 marks as
against 36 marks secured by private respondent Ku. Neelam Rathore.
On the basis of such analysis, when the Collector, Bhind allowed the
appeal then private respondent Neelam Rathore had filed second
appeal before the Court of Commissioner, Chambal Division,
Morena.
</p><p id="p_6">6.      It will be necessary to point out that Collector did not consider
any other ground namely BPL card holder and her experience
(Shishu Didi Padhna Badhna Anubhav) and treated her to be a
deserted woman and directed for issuance of order in her favour.
</p><p id="p_7">7.      These arguments gave rise to following issues namely :-
</p><p id="p_8">(i).    Whether the certificate obtained by the petitioner as
Anganwadi Karyakarta after the selection process is valid certificate?
</p><p id="p_9">(ii).   Whether the certificate produced by the petitioner of working
as Guruji and also as a voluntary teacher as are contained in
Annexure P/9 and P/10 will entitle the petitioner to get 10 marks as
per sub para 4 of clause 2(A) of the policy (Annexure P/2)?
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">                                                                WP No. 1763/2009
                 The High Court of Madhya Pradesh
                         Bench at Gwalior

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">(iii). Whether the BPL card obtained by the petitioner alongwith her
sister-in-law can be said to be a valid card entitling her to secure 10
marks on account of her place in BPL category?
</blockquote><p id="p_10">(iv). Whether the Commissioner exceeded his jurisdiction in
condoning the delay in filing the appeal as was filed by the private
respondent?
</p><p id="p_11">8.       As far as issue No. 1 is concerned, learned counsel for the
petitioner gracefully admits that the certificate (Annexure P/17) is for
the period after recruitment process was complete is of no value to
her, therefore, next issue which arises is whether certificate contained
in Annexure P/9 and P/10 pertaining to teaching experience can be
considered for granting 10 marks as per sub para 4 of clause 2 (A) of
the Policy (Annexure P/2):-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">                   Þ4- vkaxuokMh dsanksa dh lgkf;dk@feuh vkaxuokMh dsanzksa

          u x;k gks½ ß
</blockquote><p id="p_12">9.       Reading of sub para 4 of the Policy in clause 2(A) reveals
that:-
</p><p id="p_13">(i).     When circular dated 10.07.2007 is read with Circular dated
27.07.2000, as has been discussed by the High Court at Principal
Seat, Jabalpur in case of Smt. Shashikala Patel Vs. State of M.P.
decided in W.P. No. 3673/2013, on 03.12.2013, it is apparent that 10
weightage marks are given in lieu of 5 years experience as Didi.
Since petitioner did not possess 5 years teaching experience as didi
she is not entitled for 10 weighted marks.
</p><p id="p_14">(ii).    Secondly, marks for teaching in Balwadis being run by Urban
Development Authorities are to be given. But Annexure P/9 is from
                                                      WP No. 1763/2009
               The High Court of Madhya Pradesh
                       Bench at Gwalior

Gram Panchayat and not from a Balwadi of a Urban Development
Authority.
</p><p id="p_15">10.   There are no weightage marks prescribed for experience vide
Annexure P/10 as a voluntary teacher, therefore, petitioner is not
entitled to any marks on account of her teaching experience as is
contained in Annexure P/9 and P/10.
</p><p id="p_16">11.   As far as her status as a deserted woman is concerned,
Commissioner has categorically recorded a finding that though the
petitioner has filed an affidavit that she is a deserted woman but in
the form which was filled by her for appointment as Anganwadi
Karyakarta, she has shown her status as that of a married woman and
not of a deserted woman, therefore, it can be conveniently concluded
that the petitioner was not a deserted woman as per the application
form. Besides this, petitioner has not disclosed any ground for
claiming any marks on the basis of she being a deserted woman
before the Project Officer as can be seen from her first application
(Annexure P/13).
</p><p id="p_17">12.   This Court is of the opinion that subsequently merely to seek
an appointment petitioner has suppressed the fact of residing with her
husband and close relatives and projected herself to be a deserted
woman. Thus, on the ground of being a deserted woman, petitioner is
also not entitled to claim any marks and she could not have secured
any marks on this ground, therefore, the Collector erred in granting
marks treating petitioner to be a deserted woman.
</p><p id="p_18">13.   As far as BPL card is concerned, petitioner has placed reliance
on the fact that Anneuxre P/5 i.e. BPL card is a public document and
therefore, it cannot be disputed.
</p><p id="p_19">14.   The petitioner has failed to explain that how sister-in-law
(Nanad) will     be construed as a family of petitioner when her
husband is still alive and has not treated her as a wife who has been
                                                               WP No. 1763/2009
                         The High Court of Madhya Pradesh
                                 Bench at Gwalior

         deserted. The petitioner may have in individual capacity/identity or
         alongwith her husband and her in-laws but by no stretch of
         imagination status of sister-in-law as per the Hindu Law and customs
         can be considered to be head of family of the petitioner being a
         married woman and therefore, family card showing herself in BPL
         category will not give assistance to the petitioner and therefore, the
         petitioner is not entitled to claim any marks for being a BPL Card
         holder when she has tried to claim this status on the strength of
         Family Card issued to her Nanad especially when her husband is
         alive.
</p><p id="p_20">         15.      Now the only issue survives for adjudication is the ground of
         condonation of delay. The main order reveals that the Commissioner
         has considered the issue of delay and after considering the grounds,
         has condoned the delay. Once the delay has been condoned and
         ground was made out to condone the delay, there is no material to
         show that there was no application before the Commissioner to
         condone the delay, therefore, the ratio of the law laid down in the
         case of Ragho Singh (supra) will not be applicable to the facts and
         circumstances of the case. Even otherwise it is settled principle of
         law that technicalities should never be used to defeat the substantial
         rights of the other party. In the present case, the petitioner has not
         approached any of the forum as has been narrated above with clean
         hands, therefore, questioning the jurisdiction of the Commissioner on
         the basis of technicality, no relief can be granted. Thus, the petition
         fails and is dismissed.
