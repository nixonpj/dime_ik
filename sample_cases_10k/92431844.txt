The workman Sh. Santosh Kumar Sharma raised this direct industrial dispute against the

        Management of M/s. T. C. Industries U/s 10 (4<a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_1">A) of Industrial Disputes Act</a>.




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">AWARD                                                                       Page 1 of 4</span>
  Sh. Santosh Kumar Sharma Vs M/s T.C. Industries                                 DID No. 86­06


As  per the claim the workman was employed with the Management as a  'Machine


        Operator'  since   08.05.1988   and   worked   as   such   till   11.12.2004   when   his

        services were illegally terminated by the Management.

The industrial dispute was raised before this court and the Management filed its reply /

        written statement and denied its  relationship of employer / employee to Sh.

        Santosh Kumar Sharma the present workman. On all other points it was a plain

        denial by the Management.
</p>
<p id="p_8">Ld. Predecessor vide his order dated 15.01.2007 framed the following issues:­

         i. Whether there exists relationship of employer and employee between the

            parties?
</p>
<p id="p_9">         ii. As per terms of reference.
</p>
<p id="p_10">The parties led their evidence.
</p>
<p id="p_11">The workman relied upon the claim substantiated by some documents. These documents

        constitute a letter which purportedly was written by one Ajay Pandey on behalf

        of the Management in relation to supply of some industrial goods. He also filed

        some letters which were received by him during the course of his employment

        with the Management. He also relied upon a photograph which was taken by

        one   of   his   friends   showing   him   working   one   machine   on   the   Management.

        Some letters etc. were also filed.
</p>
<p id="p_12">Ld. Counsel for the Management argued that it was a case instituted by the claimant,

        therefore, the onus of proving it also lied upon him. He further submits that

        workman has not discharged this onus as he could not place anything on record

        his letter of appointment, service book, attendance register or any other similar




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">AWARD                                                                                 Page 2 of 4</span>

        documents to support his claim. The workman also could not call any other co-

        worker who would have seen him working in the Management establishment.

Specific queries  were put to the workman and his  AR  as to what  was  that  specific

        material which could show the workman's employment with the Management

        and he could rely upon only the letter Ex. WW/7 which was allegedly written

        by one Ajay Pandey. But there are further questions before this court which

        remained unanswered. Nowhere is it shown by the workman that this was a

        letter   head   used   by   the   Management   and   it   was   used   by   none   else.   The

        handwriting comparison of the said Ajay Pandey is also not available.  It is also

        not   clear  from   the  material   available   on  record  that   if  this  letter  was  to   be

        delivered by the claimant                     Sh.  Santosh Kumar Sharma to some other

        destination then how this letter is available with him. He also did not examine

        either the addressee or the scriber of this letter.

In these circumstances, this court does not find this only piece of document as being

        reliable without further corroboration by an independent piece of evidence.

Apart from this piece of evidence nothing is there on record to show that the workman

        was ever connected with the Management.
</p>
<p id="p_13">In these circumstances, this court is of the conclusion that the workman has totally failed

        to discharge his onus in proving his relation to the Management as a workman.

         ISSUE NO.1:­

In view of the above discussion the issue no. 1 is hereby held not proved.

</p><p id="p_14">        ISSUE NO.2:­

As no relation has been established by the workman, therefore, no relief is granted and

        this issue is decided in negative.

  Sh. Santosh Kumar Sharma Vs M/s T.C. Industries                          DID No. 86­06


Ultimately the case of the workman is hereby dismissed without granting any relief.

A copy of the Award be sent to the Secretary (Labour) for necessary compliance. File be

         consigned to the Record Room after completing due formalities.
