      The petitioner has filed the present petition under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_1">Article 227</a> of
                                   hy

      the Constitution of India challenging the order dated 09.10.2017
                             ad



      passed by Civil Judge Class-I, Damoh in Civil Suit No.57-A/2008,
                      M




      thereby closing the right of the petitioner to lead the evidence.
      The respondents No.1 to 4 have filed a civil suit before the trial
                   of




      Court. The petitioner has submitted an affidavit under Order 18
               rt




      Rule 4 of the Code of Civil Procedure on 26.10.2016. The case
       ou




      was fixed for petitioner's evidence on 09.10.2017. However, due
      to chest pain, he was admitted in Community Health Centre
  C




      Patheriya. Learned counsel for the petitioner therefore filed an
 h




      application under Order 17 Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure
 ig




      for adjournment. The trial Court vide impugned order dated
H




      09.10.2017 has rejected the said application and has closed the
      right of the petitioner to lead the evidence. Being aggrieved by
      the said order, the petitioner has filed the present writ petition.
      Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the trial Court has
      erred in rejecting the application preferred by the petitioner
      under Order 17 Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure. It is
      submitted that the petitioner is about 73 years of age and is not
      keeping well. On 09.10.2017 when the case was fixed for
      petitioner's evidence, he was admitted in the hospital. The
       petitioner has also filed a copy of OPD slip, however, the said fact
      has not been taken into consideration by the trial Court and




                                                         sh
      rejected the application submitted by the petitioner.
      On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondent No.1




                                                    e
                                                 ad
      supports the order passed by the trial Court. It is submitted that
      the case was fixed for petitioner's evidence for number of times

                                            Pr
      but the statements could not be recorded for one reason or the
      other. It is further submitted that the petitioner has made false
                                     a
                                   hy

      pleading in the petition. It is submitted that in paragraph No.5.2
      of the petition, the petitioner has submitted that he was having
                             ad



      chest pain, however, the copy of OPD slip, which is filed along
                      M




      with an application for adjournment shows that he was suffering
                   of




      from Dairrhea. It is further submitted that the document
      (Annexure P/4) was not produced by the petitioner before the trial
             rt




      Court and the said document does not bear the signature of
       ou




      doctor. Thus, this document a concocted document and therefore,
  C




      the same cannot be relied on.
      I have heard learned counsel for the petitioner and perused the
 h
 ig




      record as well as the impugned order. From perusal of the order
      passed by the trial Court, it appears that the case was fixed for
H




      petitioner's evidence for number of times but the statement of
      petitioner could not be recorded for one or the other reasons. The
      case is pending since 2008 i.e. more than 5 years and the
      therefore, the trial Court has rejected the application submitted
      by the petitioner. Thus, the trial Court has rightly closed the right
      of the petitioner's to lead the evidence. However, looking to the
      age of the petitioner as well as in the interest of justice one
      opportunity is granted to the petitioner to lead the evidence
       before the trial Court subject to payment of costs of Rs.5,000/-,
      which would be payable to the respondents. The trial Court shall




                                                        sh
      proceed to record the petitioner's evidence on the date to be fixed
      by it. However, the trial Court shall not grant any further




                                                   e
                                                ad
      adjournment to the petitioner.
      Accordingly, the petition stands disposed of.
