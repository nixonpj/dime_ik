   core PVC wire Ex. P1 and two core alluminuim wire Ex. P2. He has also

   proved seizure memo dated 24.08.2006 Ex. CW2/D. 

</p><p id="p_8">8. I have heard Ld. counsel for accused and counsel for complainant (deemed

   APP) and perused the record carefully.
</p>
<p id="p_9">9. Counsel for complainant has argued that accused committed direct theft of

   electricity through private illegal wire, i.e. 2 X 10 mm Sq. cable black in

   colour from BSES joint board.  No meter was found at site.

</p><p id="p_10">10.On the other hand Ld. Counsel for the accused has argued that no raid

   was conducted in the premises belonging to the accused as case is only

   based   on   hearsay   evidence   and   no   independent   witness   has   been

   examined by the complainant. 
</p>
<p id="p_11">11.In order to prove the case against the accused complainant is required to

   establish that the theft of electricity was being committed at the premises

   inspected by the raiding party. Complainant is further required to link the

   accused to the premises and prove that the accused was responsible for

   commission of theft of electricity.
</p>
<p id="p_12">12.Accused   has   vehemently   disputed   that   no   raid   was   conducted   at   his

   premises and has further submitted that there is no evidence to show that

   the theft, if any, was being committed at his behest or that he had in any

   manner aided or abetted the commission of offence.

</p><p id="p_14">13.Testimony of PW 2   Sh. Satish Kumar and PW 3 Sh. S. K. Gajbhiye is

   consistent   so   far   as   the   factum   of   theft   is   concerned.     No   material

   contradiction striking to the root of case has been brought on the point of

   detection of theft.   As such detection of electricity theft stands proved on

   record.  
</p>
<p id="p_15">14.PW 2 Sh. Satish Kumar has stated that after inquiry from a lady he came

   to know that accused Pappu is the user of the premises in question. He did

   not make any inquiry at any point of time as there is any person in the

   name of accused Pappu and as to the fact that who is the actual owner of

   the property. PW 3 Sh. S. K. Gajbhiye has deposed he reached at site at 1

   PM and on his instructions the illegal wire of size 2 X4 mm Sq.  of length

   about 9 ½ m of black colour and PVC singly core cable aluminium wire

   quantity 2 in number of length about 38 ms total of size 4 mm sq. each of

   black colour were seized. He proved the single core PVC wire as Ex. P1

   and two core aluminium wire as Ex. P2 and seizure memo as Ex. CW2/D.

   However, on pointing out by the Counsel for accused Court has observed

   that   the   wire   which   is   allegedly   used   as   mode   of   theft   is   about   5   m   in

   length. 
</p>
<p id="p_16">15.The  alleged public persons present  at the site have not been made  as

   witnesses   and   neither   their   particulars   have   been   disclosed   by   the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">C.C. No. 477/07                     BYPL Vs. Pappu               Page 5 of 7</span>
                                                  ­6­

   complainant.  Further no evidence was led by the complainant to prove that

   the accused is the owner of the premises.  Unfortunately, the persons who

   were found actually aiding the commission of theft at the site have not been

   arrayed   as   an   accused   and   the   complainant   has   merely   booked   as   an

   accused on the information. In order to connect the accused it requires to

   established on record, beyond reasonable doubt that the said persons were

   resorting to theft at behest of accused.  In the absence of same it may not

   be safe to connect the accused assuming that he was indulging in direct

   theft of electricity.
</p>
<p id="p_17">16.The   principles   of   fastening   criminal   liability   is   different   than   that   of   civil

   liability   in   case   the   use   of   electricity.     The   language   of   <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_4">Section   135</a>   of

   Electricity Act even if considered as it is, it refers to whoever and the same

   would mean a person who is involved in the commission of offence.  It is

   true   that   the   essential   purpose   of   the   enactment   of   the   Act   and   more

   particularly   <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_5">Section   135</a>   of   the   Act   is   to   book   the   offenders,   who   are

   committing   theft   of   electricity,   but   there   cannot   be   any   intention   of   the

   legislature to punish the persons other than the offenders.

</p><p id="p_18">17.For   the   foregoing   reasons,   complainant   has   failed   to   bring   home   the

   charge   against   the   accused   beyond   reasonable   doubt.     Accused   is

   accordingly acquitted of the offence U/s 135 of the <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_6">Electricity Act</a>, 2003.
