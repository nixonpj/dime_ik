HIGH COURT OF JUDICATURE AT ALLAHABAD, LUCKNOW BENCH
 
 

?Court No. - 1
 

 
Case :- P.I.L. CIVIL No. - 23367 of 2017
 

 
Petitioner :- Shivam Mishra &amp; Anr.
 
Respondent :- District Magistrate Sitapur &amp; Ors.
 
Counsel for Petitioner :- Shivam Sharma
 
Counsel for Respondent :- C.S.C.,Pushpila Bisht
 

 
Hon'ble Pankaj Kumar Jaiswal,J.
</pre> 
<p id="p_1">Hon'ble Alok Mathur,J.
</p> 
<p id="p_2">Case called out none appears for the petitioners. 
</p> 
<p id="p_3">Heard learned Standing Counsel for respondent nos. 1, 2 and 3 as well as Ms. Pushpila Bisht, learned counsel for respondent no. 4.
</p> 
<p id="p_4">By means of this writ petition the petitioners namely Shivam Mishra and Brijesh Kumar are praying for issuing a writ of mandamus directing respondent nos. 1 to 4 to take appropriate action for restraining the respondent no. 5 from establishing and running a petrol pump over Gata No. 1071, situated about 130 feet west of Sanda-Biswan Road, in Sanda Village, marked as RO Dealership at Village - Sanda, on Sanda-Biswan Road, Sitapur on the ground that Gata No. 1071 belongs to the Gaon Sabha and being situated along the road, a public park is proposed on Gata No. 1071. The private respondent has wrongly shown the same to be Gata No. 1070.
</p> 
<p id="p_5">A counter affidavit has been filed by respondent no. 4. As per counter affidavit, the petrol pump is situated at Gata No. 1070 and learned counsel appearing for respondent no. 4 has raised a preliminary objection in respect of locus-standi of the writ petitioners in filing this petition as Public Interest Litigation, on the ground that the petitioner no. 1 is brother of Sri Alok Kumar Mishra, S/o Sri Aditya Prakash Mishra and existing petrol pump dealership situated at Sanda operating in the name and style of M/s Kanak Bihari Kishan Sewa Kendra. A copy of the license no. 110 issued to the aforesaid firm has been annexed as Annexure CA-1 to the counter affidavit.
</p> 
<p id="p_6">Learned counsel for respondent no. 4 has further submitted that credential of petitioner no. 1 is not of a bonafide public spirited litigant. He has filed the present writ petition in order to maintain monopoly of his brother's dealership in Sanda and to continue to earn higher profit which is nothing but a petition filed by rival contender and therefore the public interest litigation at his behest is not maintainable. 
</p> 
<p id="p_7">It has further been submitted on behalf of respondent no. 4 that all the representations annexed with the writ petition have been preferred by one Grijesh Kumar and also the entire writ petition has been signed by Grijesh Kumar whereas the affidavit has been sworn and signed by Brijesh Kumar (petitioner no. 2), this establishes that writ petition is a sham and has been filed with ulterior motive.
</p> 
<p id="p_8">Learned counsel for respondent no. 4 lastly submits that the retail outlet is to be established on Gata No. 1070 and not on Gata No. 1070 which is adjoining to Gata No. 1071 and the retail outlet, establishment/running of which is being opposed by the petitioners is being established after obtaining all statutory approvals i.e. no objection certificate from the District Magistrate which clearly indicates that there is no park proposed on the land in question and furthermore conversion of land under Section 143 of U.P. U.P. Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act has been also been made.
</p> 
<p id="p_9">Considering the aforesaid, we are of view that the petitioners have filed this writ petition with ulterior motive and malafide intention only to create monopoly and present litigation is nothing but an attempt to protect their business interest.
</p> 
<p id="p_10">With aforesaid the writ petition is dismissed. 
</p> 
<p id="p_11">Order Date :- 22.11.2019
 
A. Verma
