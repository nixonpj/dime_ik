                 CORAM: HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE MIHIR KUMAR JHA
                 ORAL ORDER</pre>

<p id="p_1">3   26-08-2015                Heard learned counsel for the parties.

</p><p id="p_2">                              Having regard to the fact that the petitioner is made

                 accused for offence under <a href="/doc/988620/" id="a_1">Sections 406</a> &amp; <a href="/doc/1436241/" id="a_2">420</a> of the Indian Penal

                 Code and <a href="/doc/361626/" id="a_3">Section 7</a> of the Essential Commodities Act, this Court

                 would find that on verification and computation of account

                 between the petitioner and the Bihar State Food &amp; Civil Supplies

                 Corporation Limited, it has been discovered that the petitioner was

                 supplied only 29087.2 quintals of paddy and not 35955.2 quintals,

                 the resultant loss assessed to the tune of Rs.1,24,66,661/- in the

                 F.I.R. is also erroneous. As the things have now surfaced, the total

                 liability of the petitioner on account of the paddy, in question,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1"> Patna High Court Cr.Misc. No.25017 of 2015 (3) dt.26-08-2015                     2</span>




             would be to the tune of Rs. 24 lacs approximately. The petitioner

             claims that he has an outstanding amount of Rs. 18 lacs against the

             Corporation but, the counsel for the Corporation comes out with

             an explanation that the petitioner at best would be entitled to get a

             sum of Rs. 1,95,000/- against his bills.
</p>
<p id="p_3">                            This Court, however, is not required to go into the

             accounting, inasmuch as, this much is admitted that the petitioner,

             on account of being supplied paddy for its being returned in the

             form of CMR, owes certain money to the Corporation and,

             therefore, this Court will have to proceed on the admitted amount.

             Thus, as the things now stand, the petitioner will be liable to pay a

             sum of Rs. 22 lacs approximately even after getting discount for a

             sum of Rs. 2 lacs approximately against his pending bills and

             would not be entitled for privilege of anticipatory bail.

</p><p id="p_4">                            When such an observation has been made, Mr. Harsha

             Singh, learned counsel for the petitioner, has offered that the

             petitioner would pay a sum of Rs. 22 (twenty two) lacs to the

             Corporation but the same should be kept subject to the result of

             the pending trial against the petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_5">                           In that view of the matter, this Court would direct the

             petitioner, namely, Pawan Kumar @ Pawan Kumar Singh to

             surrender before the court below within a period of six weeks from
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2"> Patna High Court Cr.Misc. No.25017 of 2015 (3) dt.26-08-2015                         3</span>




             today with a draft of Rs. 22 lacs payable in the name of Bihar

             State Food &amp; Civil Supplies Corporation Limited and if he does

             so, he shall be released on bail on furnishing bail bond of Rs.

             10,000/- (ten thousand) with two sureties of the like amount each

             to the satisfaction of Shri Mithilesh Kumar, Judicial Magistrate, 1st

             Class, Bhojpur in connection with Azimabad P.S. Case No. 19 of

             2015, subject to the conditions as laid down under <a href="/doc/1692057/" id="a_4">Section 438(2)</a>

             of the Cr.P.C. as also subject to following conditions:-


</p><p id="p_6">             (i)      The amount of Rs. 22 lacs deposited by the petitioner in the

             name of Bihar State Food and Civil Supplies Corporation shall be

             handed over to the District Manager of the Corporation, Bhojpur

             but, then, this amount shall remain subject to the final outcome of

             the trial against the petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_7">             (ii)     That both the bailors will be a close relative of the

             petitioner, who will undertake an affidavit giving genealogy as to

             how they are related with the petitioner. The bailors will also

             undertake to inform the court if there is any change in the address

             of the petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_8">             (iii)    That the affidavit shall clearly state that the petitioner is not

             an accused in any other case and if he is, he shall not be released

             on bail.
</p>
<p id="p_9">             (iv)     That the bailors shall also state on affidavit that they will

                       inform the court concerned, if the petitioner is implicated in any

                       other case of similar nature after his release in the present case and

                       thereafter the court below will be at liberty to initiate the

                       proceeding for cancellation of bail on the ground of misuse.

</p><p id="p_10">                       (v)      That the petitioner will be well represented on each and

                       every date in course of trial and if he fails to do so on two

                       consecutive dates, his bail will be liable to be cancelled on this

                       ground alone.
