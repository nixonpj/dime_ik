4   31-07-2018                  All these Letters Patent Appeals are arising out of

                  common judgment dated 02.07.2018 passed by the learned Writ

</p><p id="p_4">                      Brief History

</p><p id="p_5">                      3.     It appears that earlier by a Regulation and

         Ordinance the procedures for admission of two years Bachelor

         of    Education        (Secondary)        Programme   was   circulated.
 Patna High Court LPA No.902 of 2018(4) dt.31-07-2018
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                            4/14</span>




         Procedures were provided for admission of students through a

         common entrance test for all the B.Ed College either constituent

         or affiliated. It was a kind of decision taken under Section 38 (4)

         read with Section 39 (2) of the Bihar Universities Act, 1976.

</p><p id="p_6">                      4.    The said Ordinance/Regulation was challenged

         before this Court in C.W.J.C. No. 7851 of 2016 on several

         grounds including that certain special privileges have been

         conferred upon the minority institutions and therefore a relief

         was prayed for allowing these institutions to admit students by

         following their own procedures as have been adopted earlier.

         This Court passed an interim order dated 13.05.2016 allowing

         the writ petitioners to admit students as per their own

         procedures. The admission for Session 2016-18 was completed.

         Subsequent orders permitting the same were also passed.

</p><p id="p_7">                      5. This Court ultimately decided the issue raised in

         the writ application vide its common judgment dated 27.10.2016

         in the case of Mirza Ghalib T.T. College &amp; Ors. Vs. State of

         Bihar and Ors. reported in 2017 (1) PLJR 256. Paragraph 73

         of the said judgment is the foundation of the present case and

         therefore, we think it just and proper to quote paragraph 73 of

         the said judgment, which reads as under:-
</p>
<p id="p_8">                           "73. Taking a cue from the observations
                           made in paragraph 19 of Supreme Court

                           decision in case of Islamic Academy of
                           Education (supra), we observe that the
                           Chancellor of the Universities of Bihar
                           shall have power to permit an institution,
                           which has been established and which has
                           been permitted to adopt its own
                           admission procedure for the last, at least,
                           25 years, against which no finger has ever
                           been raised and no complaint made
                           regarding fairness, to adopt its own
                           admission procedure. It is made clear
                           that no institute which has not been
                           established and which has not followed
                           its own admission procedure for the last,
                           at least 25 years shall be permitted to
                           apply for or be granted exemption from
                           admitting students through CET. If any
                           Committee has been constituted, in the
                           light of Supreme Court decisions in case
                           of Islamic Academy of Education
                           ( supra)/ P.A. Inamdar (supra), such
                           Committee shall also have the power to
                           grant such exemption, after due notice
                           and adequate opportunity to the State of
                           Bihar and the affiliating University of
                           hearing."
</p><p id="p_9">                      6. The contention of the petitioners in the present writ

         applications are that pursuant to the observations of this Court in

         the case of Mirza Ghalib T.T. College (Supra), once the

         Hon'ble Chancellor has granted exemption to the petitioners

         college, vide order dated 16.03.2018, allowing the petitioners

         college to adopt their own admission procedure and pursuant to

         the said decision (Annexure 11 to the writ application), when
 Patna High Court LPA No.902 of 2018(4) dt.31-07-2018
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                            6/14</span>




         the petitioners college published an advertisement in the daily

         Hindi newspaper calling the candidate for the admission in the

         two years degree course for the Sessions 2018-20 and in one of

         the cases the date of examination was notified to be held on

         20.05.2018, results were published and the date of counseling

         was fixed, all of a sudden the Hon'ble Chancellor has reversed

         the earlier decision dated 16.03.2018 by the present impugned

         order dated 30.05.2018 as contained in Annexure-1 to the writ

         application. In other two cases also advertisements were already

         published much before revocation of exemption and the

         candidates had already made applications for admission.

         Ghalib T.T. College (Supra), after due consideration and upon

         examination of materials available on the record once the

         Hon'ble Chancellor has granted exemption to the writ

         application is violative of the principle of natural justice. It is

         submitted that the order as contained in Annexure-1 has been

         sought to be made applicable with retrospective effect which is

         not permissible as the action of the Hon'ble Chancellor would

         cause much hardships not only to the colleges in question but

         also to the students who have already proceeded for and

         appeared in the examination held by these colleges. It is

         submitted that the principle of estoppel and fair play in action

         would be fully applicable in the facts and circumstances of the

         present case.

         Court learned Senior Counsel(s) submit that the learned Writ

         Court has held in the impugned judgment that the observation in

         paragraph 73 of the judgment in the case of Mirza Ghalib T.T.

         College (Supra) put a bar on the discretion of the Hon'ble

         Chancellor to exempt an institution from combined entrance test

         based admission and is restricted to be applied to such

         institutions only who fulfilled the prescribed requirements but

         the learned Writ Court instead of examining the contention of

         the writ petitioners that they were granted exemption by the

         Hon'ble Chancellor only after being fully satisfied that the

         petitioner(s) duly fulfill the prescribed requirements. It is

         submitted that the exemption has been withdrawn unilaterally

         all of a sudden. It is further submitted that while rejecting the

         contentions of the writ petitioners the learned Writ Court has

         held inter alia that "when the Division Bench allowed discretion

         to be exercised by the Hon'ble Chancellor for grant of

         exemption or recall exemption, even if granted....."

         entrance test for all B.Ed. College affiliated to State University

         of Bihar, if the Hon'ble Chancellor has decided to recall the

<p id="p_16">                      11. It is submitted that in view of the observations of

         this Court, the Hon'ble Chancellor constituted a sub-committee

         of the Vice Chancellors who prepared a draft statute for the

         State Level Combined Entrance Test and the same has been

         approved by the Admission Committee of the Hon'ble

         Chancellor and in terms of approved statute now a combined

         circumstances following the observations of the Hon'ble

         Supreme Court in the case of T.M.A. Pai Foundation, the

         Hon'ble Chancellor took a view that allowing these institutions

         to conduct separate entrance test would create hardship and

         shall impose heavy burden on the students if they were

         compelled to pay application fees separately for each institute,

         therefore taking in view the welfare                  of the students, the

         impugned decision was taken vide letter dated 30.05.2018. It is

         submitted that no fault may be found in the impugned decision

         of the Hon'ble Chancellor and the learned Writ Court has

         committed no error by rejecting the writ applications.

         appellant(s) in all these Letters Patent Appeal and learned

         counsel representing the Universities as well as learned counsel

         representing Hon'ble Chancellor, we find that there is no dispute

         on facts that pursuant to the observation of this Court in

         paragraph 73 of the judgment in the case of Mirza Ghalib T.T.

         College (Supra), the Hon'ble Chancellor took a conscience

         decision on 16.03.2018 allowing these writ petitioners, who are

         the minority institutions, to follow their own admission

         procedure. It is not in dispute that the petitioners published
 Patna High Court LPA No.902 of 2018(4) dt.31-07-2018
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                            12/14</span>




         advertisement immediately after the decision of the Hon'ble

         Chancellor was communicated to them. The petitioners invited

         applications from eligible candidates, the date of schedule were

         notified in the advertisements wherein in one of the cases the

         last date for submission of application was fixed on 08.05.2018.

         The examination was scheduled to be held on 20.05.2018, till

         date of holding of the examination, the Hon'ble Chancellor had

         not revoked the exemption granted to the petitioners. It is only

         after the institution had already held the examination, the

         impugned decision came on 30.05.2018. By this time the result

         was to be published and counseling dates were already fixed. In

         other two cases advertisements were published long back and

         the institutions had already accepted applications from the

         eligible candidates and date of examination had been notified,

         all preparations had been done by these colleges when the

         impugned decision was taken without giving any opportunity to

         the petitioners to explain their position. We are not saying that

         revocation of exemption is per se illegal or bad in law. We fully

         appreciate the efforts taken by the Hon'ble Chancellor wherein

         the statute has been drafted and now approved for holding a

         combined entrance test for all the B.Ed. Colleges in the State of

         Bihar but to us it appears that so far as these writ petitioners are

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                                            13/14</span>




         concerned, they had proceeded to advertise       under bonafide

         belief that they have been granted exemption by the Hon'ble

         Chancellor to follow their own procedures of admission. The

         writ petitioners had already notified last date for submission of

         the application by the eligible candidates, the candidates had

         therefore submitted their applications with requisite fees for

         examination and they had participated in the examination held

         by atleast one of the institutions, therefore the procedure for

         admission had already begun in these institutions on the basis of

         a legal and valid order of exemption granted by the Hon'ble

         Chancellor.

<p id="p_19">                      14. The principle of estoppel is a rule of evidence

         wherein a party is stopped from taking a plea if by virtue of his

         representations the other side has moved and altered his

         position. In the present case, we find that these writ petitioners

         had already moved and had moved up to holding of the

         examination after submission of the application forms by the

         eligible candidates, the institutions had collected applications

         and notified the dates of examinations. They were notified about

         revoking of exemption only on 30.05.2018. In our considered

         opinion, once the petitioners were given to understand that they

         can legally and validly proceed to adopt their own procedure for

                  admission of this Session, only because subsequently the statute

                  has been framed and approved it can not be applied against the

                  petitioners when they have already proceeded by some

                  significant act to conduct their admission tests. We, therefore

                  take a view that the impugned decision by which the Hon'ble

                  Chancellor has been pleased to revoke the exemption granted to

                  these writ petitioners cannot be allowed to operate with

                  retrospective effect. The order of revocation shall be applicable

                  prospectively from the next academic sessions.

                  are allowed to the extent indicated hereinabove.
