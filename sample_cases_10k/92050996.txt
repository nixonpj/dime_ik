<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">        2.   The   petitioner       is   the   sole   accused   in

Spl.CC.No.485/2019 on the file of the 39th Addl. CMM

Court, Nrupatunga Road, Bangalore City. The respondent

police have registered a case against the petitioner in

Cr.No.27/2019 for the offence punishable under <a href="/doc/619940/" id="a_2">Sections

363</a>, <a href="/doc/796352/" id="a_3">366</a>, <a href="/doc/1279834/" id="a_4">376</a>, <a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_5">34</a> of IPC and Section 4 &amp; 6 of POCSO Act,

2012.
</p>
<p id="p_4">
</p><p id="p_5">        3.   The brief allegations are that both the victim

girl and the accused belong to the same place i.e.,

Bengaluru; the victim said to have failed in tenth standard

and on account of that she has discontinued her studies;

the accused and the victim fell in love and started loving

each other; both were advised by the victim girl's parents.

It is also stated that victim was working in a vegetable

shop where the accused was also working.               They have

developed intimacy with each other and the accused
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                              3</span>



petitioner persuaded her that he would like her and also

wish to marry her.    In this context, it is stated that on

14.02.2019, the victim girl went along with the accused to

Mysore, and from there to Hyderabad and thereafter to

Thirupathi, took a room at SriKrishna Residency, enjoyed

their sex and thereafter the accused took her to the house

of his maternal uncle and disclosed that both of them are

loving each other and they would like to marry.       In this

context, a complaint came to be lodged and on 26.02.2019

they were located and thereafter police have arrested the

accused and on 04.03.2019 the victim girl was taken to

Balakiya Balamandira and recorded her statement wherein

it clearly discloses that she was already aged 17 years 10

months and was in the verge of attaining majority.       The

fact as to whether she has actually crossed 18 years or

below the age of 18 years; whether she herself has given

consent to go along with the accused and have sexual

activity should be established during the course of full

fledged trial. As could be seen from the statement of the

victim girl, she herself has stated that she voluntarily went
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                     4</span>



along with the accused.             Therefore, the petitioner is

entitled to be enlarged on bail on conditions. Hence, the

following:

petitioner shall be released on bail in connection with
