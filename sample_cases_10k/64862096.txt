BRIEF STATEMENT OF REASONS FOR DECISION :

</pre><p id="p_1">            Briefly stated the case of the prosecution is that after
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                       2</span>

receiving information vide DD No.10A dated 31.01.96, SI Karam Chand

went at the spot and found truck No. DHL 5121. Injured was reported to

be taken away to the hospital and he reached hospital after leaving Ct.

Ramjas at the spot. There he met one eye witness of the incident namely

Sohan Lal and recorded his statement and on the basis of his statement,

present case was registered u/S 279/337 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_3">IPC</a>.           Thereafter, further

investigation was done and during the investigation injured Sumeet had

finally expired and finally charge sheet was filed in the court on 06.06.97

for the offence u/S 279/304-A <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_4">IPC</a> and copies of the same were supplied

to the accused to his satisfaction.
</p>
<p id="p_2">            On    the basis of the challan, charge for committing the

offence punishable under <a href="/doc/1270101/" id="a_5">Section 279</a>/<a href="/doc/1371604/" id="a_6">304-A</a> IPC was framed against the

accused on 11.01.1999, to which accused pleaded not guilty and claimed

trial.
</p>
<p id="p_3">

</p><p id="p_4">2.          In support of its case prosecution examined twelve witnesses

in support of its case. Thereafter, statement u/S 313 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_7">Cr.P.C</a> of the

accused recorded.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                     3</span><p id="p_5">

</p><p id="p_6">3.         Ld. Defence counsel submitted that prosecution has not been

able to prove rashness or negligence on the part of accused, though he

fairly conceded that there is change in defence of the accused. While

earlier the defence was that accused was not the driver of the vehicle,

however, now that fact is not disputed and the only defence is that the

accident had not taken place because of fault of the accused.

</p><p id="p_7">           Substitute APP, on the other hand, relies upon the statement

of PW4 primarily and submits that prosecution has proved that accused

was driving the vehicle at faster speed and thus he caused this accident

due to his rashness.
</p>
<p id="p_8">

</p><p id="p_9">4.         I have given due consideration to the contentions made by

both the parties and have carefully gone through the evidences and

material on record.
</p>
<p id="p_10">

</p><p id="p_11">5.         Undoubtedly, PW4 is the star witness of the prosecution.

This witness has been projected as eye witness of the accident. This

witness is uncle of the deceased child. In his examination in chief, PW4

has simply stated that while deceased Sumeet was crossing the road the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                      4</span>

truck No. DHL 5121 came from the side of ITO Flyover in a very fast

speed and in rash manner and struck against Sumeet.              He further

deposed that accident took place due to fault of accused as he was

driving the truck in a very fast speed and also in a rash manner. In his

cross examination, first of all, he deposed that he was at a distance of

about five to ten feet from the spot, thereafter, after seeing the site plan,

he deposed that he was about at a distance of 70 to 75 feet from the spot.

Again he could not give any idea of distance of 75 feet. All this scenario

shows that witness was not very sure about his own place and secondly

he was not very sure about his deposition before the court. This witness

further pointed out a place in site plan, which was marked as Point A on

Ex. PW12/A regarding the place where he was present. The point A

marked with red pen is a position, which is far away from the spot of

accident as shown in the site plan. In his further cross examination, this

witness deposed that he had crossed the road while the deceased

Sumeet could not completely crossed the road.             He admitted the

suggestion that he was accompanied by Sumeet, but he did not

accompany him up to the other side of the road. He further deposed that

when this witness was going from his home to attend the call of nature,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                      5</span>

and when he was in the process of attending the call of nature, he had

not seen/noticed the deceased on those occasions. He further deposed

that when he noticed the deceased, he found him to be playing with other

children on the other side of the road.
</p>
<p id="p_12">            Since accused had already admitted that he was driver of this

bus and that this accident had taken place, this court has to decide only

one question whether the accident had taken place due to rash or

negligent driving of the accused ?        From the perusal of aforesaid

statement of alleged eye witness PW4, I do not find a clear cut picture in

respect of the accident.    This witness who otherwise deposed in his

examination in chief that he had gone along with his nephew Sumeet for

easing out, later on, deposed that he had even not noticed Sumeet while

going to attend call of nature. These are totally opposite stand taken by

him. Though, he had admitted that the deceased child was playing with

other children on the other side of the road. Accused in his statement,

deposed that this accident had not taken place due to his fault as one of

the child had come on the middle of the road all of a sudden. From the

half hearted narration of actual facts by PW4, I do smell probability of this

scenario where the deceased would have tried to cross the road. When
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                     6</span>

any child or other person suddenly crosses the road, the fault of accident

cannot be imputed on the driver of the vehicle.         It has been well

established again and again by higher courts that simply driving at high

speed is not example of rash or negligence, until unless it is coupled or

followed by some additional duty on the driver, which arise out of peculiar

situation of a particular case.
</p>
<p id="p_13">            The site plan and the case of prosecution story shows that the

place of accident in this case was on the Ring Road where normally any

vehicle drives at a higher speed. The accident had taken place near the

driver of the road, which is not a normal place for any person to remain on

the road. No driver can be expected to be so much vigilant as to take

care of sudden crossing of the road by any person or child and to stop the

vehicle at once.
</p>
<p id="p_14">            In this regard I rely upon AIR 1972 SUPREME COURT 221

wherein it has been held that, Negligent driving along public way - If

a pedestrian suddenly crosses a road without taking note of the

approaching bus there is every possibility of his dashing against

the bus without the driver becoming aware of it. The bus driver

cannot save accident, however slowly he may be driving and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                    7</span>

therefore he cannot be held to be negligent in such a case.

</p><p id="p_15">            Therefore, I come to the conclusion that prosecution has not

been able to prove the element of rashness or negligence on the part of

accused. It has been held in judgment cited as 133(2006) DLT 562,

wherein Hon'ble High Court of Delhi observed that it was for

prosecution to bring on record material to establish as to what is

meant by "high speed".        It was further observed that burden of

proving everything essential to establishment of charge against

accused always rests on prosecution - There is presumption of

innocence in favour of accused until contrary is proved.



</p><p id="p_16">6.          In view of my above discussion, I am of the considered

opinion that prosecution has failed to prove its case against the accused

beyond reasonable doubt. Hence, accused is acquitted of the charges

levelled against him.
</p>
<p id="p_17">            Bail bond stands cancelled. Surety is discharged. File be

consigned to record room.</p><pre id="pre_3">
