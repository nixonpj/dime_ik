                 CORAM: HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE BIRENDRA PRASAD VERMA
                 ORAL ORDER</pre>

<p id="p_1">3   28-06-2016                 Heard the parties.
</p><p id="p_2">                               The petitioners have filed the present writ petition
                 under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India raising a grievance
                 against the notices dated 27.11.2013 issued under the signature of
                 the respondent Anchal Adhikari, Mainatand, West Champaran, as
                 contained in Annexure-2 series, whereby they have been informed
                 that the lands belonging to them are in the process of acquisition
                 for construction of Indo-Nepal Border Road Project.
</p><p id="p_3">                               The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1"> Patna High Court CWJC No.5532 of 2014 (3) dt.28-06-2016</span>

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                          2/3</span>




             petitioners submits that all the petitioners are members of the
             Scheduled Tribes and if their lands are acquired, then they would
             practically become landless persons. He further submits that no
             notice or information was given to the petitioners for or after
             initiation of land acquisition proceeding with respect to the lands
             in question belonging to them. However, in the whole writ petition
             no where it has been stated that any Award has been prepared
             under the provisions of <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_2">The Land Acquisition Act</a>, 1894 (in short,
             "the Act, 1894") for acquisition of lands in question.
</p><p id="p_4">                            The learned AC to AG, appearing on behalf of the
             respondents, by referring to the averments made in the counter
             affidavit filed on behalf of the respondent nos. 2,4 and 5, submits
             that the apprehension of the petitioners about acquisition of their
             lands are completely misplaced. According to him, though land
             acquisition proceeding was started for acquisition of certain area
             of lands for the project in question under the provisions of the Act,
             1894, which has now been repealed; therefore, the whole
             proceeding has been stayed by the State authorities and decision
             has been taken to start a fresh land acquisition proceeding under
             the provisions of The Right to Fair Compensation and
             Transparency         in     Land      Acquisition,   Rehabilitation   and
             Resettlement Act, 2013 ( in short, "the Act, 2013"). He further
             submits that if such a proceeding is started under the provisions of
             the Act, 2013 and the Rules made thereunder with respect to lands
             of the petitioners, then they shall be given opportunity of hearing.
             He next submits that, at the moment, no such proceeding is
             pending even under the Act, 2013.
</p><p id="p_5">                            In view of the above fair stand taken on behalf of the
             respondents and in view of the statements made in paragraphs 9
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">           Patna High Court CWJC No.5532 of 2014 (3) dt.28-06-2016</span>

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                                    3/3</span>




                       and 10 of the counter affidavit, this Court is of the opinion that
                       the present writ petition has practically become infructuous and
                       apprehension of the petitioners regarding acquisition of their lands
                       under the provisions of the Act, 1894 is completely misconceived.
                       Accordingly, the writ petition stands disposed of as infructuous.
</p><p id="p_6">                                      However, it goes without saying that if fresh
                       proceeding is started under the provisions of the Act, 2013 with
                       respect to the lands in question belonging to the petitioners, then
                       opportunity of hearing must be given to them, besides others, if
                       any.
