JUDGMENT 
</pre>

<p id="p_1">This   appeal   is   directed   against   the   order   dated   07/02/09   passed   by

Juvenile Justice Board, Delhi Gate, New Delhi by which the appellant was

declared an adult.   The facts of the case, in brief, are that the appellant

alongwith two other co­accused persons is involved in a case of gang rape

under section 376 (g) <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_1">IPC</a> in case FIR No. 577/05 Police Station Vasant

Kunj.  The appellant alongwith co­accused persons was challaned before 
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                                2</span>

Juvenile Board by SHO concerned and it was specified in the challan that

the age of the appellant as per bone age report is more than 19 years so

his case shall be transferred to the concerned court.  The learned Juvenile

Justice Board­II by impugned order dated 07/02/09 held that the appellant

was an adult.
</p>
<p id="p_2">                I have heard the learned counsel for the appellant and learned

Additional Public Prosecutor and have gone through the authorities relied

on   behalf   of   the   appellant   and   I   have   also   gone   through   the   trial   court

record, appeal file and the relevant provisions of  law. 

</p><p id="p_3">                As   per   the   report   of   the   Medical   Board   Ex.CW1/A   and

Ex.CW1/B, the age of the appellant was more than 19 years as on the date

                                                                              rd
of his examination on 14/11/05. According to the report the 3  molar of the

appellant had not erupted by then.  The contention of learned counsel for

the appellant is that as per the books on Medical Jurisprudence the age of

the appellant was 17­25 years as on the date of his examination by board

           rd
as the 3   molar has not erupted.   This fact   has also taken note of by

Juvenile Justice Board in its report.  Although the three medical witnesses 
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                              3</span>

CW1, CW4 and CW5 examined before Juvenile Justice Board have stated

in the last part of their examination in chief that the appellant was more

than   19  years   of  age   as   on  the   date  of   commission   of   the   offence   i.e.

10/10/05 but they have not given any reason as per medical science as to

why the age of more than 19 years given by Medical Board as on 14/11/05

can relate back to date of offence i.e. 10/10/05.  The learned Counsel for


the appellant has relied upon the authorities Ravi­ul­Islam Vs. State 2006


(2) C.C.Cases (HC) 157 and also  Vikas Chaudhary Vs. State 143 2007


Delhi Law Times 603 Delhi High Court and in both these authorities our

Hon'ble   High   Court   has   found   the   accused   entitled   to   2   years

margin/deduction from the lower age given in the ossification examination


as just and proper.   Further in  Manjeet Vs. State Crml. MC No. 384/04


decided on 05/04/06 by our Hon'ble High Court copy of which is filed on


behalf of the appellant, the  State Vs. M K report 2000 SC crt 89 (a)  is


relied upon wherein Hon'ble Apex Court relying on medical jurisprudence

has held that there is possibility of variation of three years plus and minus

side as to the age of accused determined by ossification test.  
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                                4</span>

</p><p id="p_4">               In the present case although the doctors concerned consisting

of the medical board have examined the appellant after 1 month and 5

days of the date of the incident and in their report Ex.CW1/B they have

opined     that   the   appellant   was   19   years   of   age   as   on   the   date   of   the

commission of offence but they have stated in their examination in chief

that he was more than 19 years of age on the date of incident also i.e.

10/10/05.   Why is it so?   On what basis and medical principle they have

stated so is not may required by them.   The rule 12 (3)(b) which speak

about the giving of benefit of the child and juvenile of one year margin from

the lower side of the age determined by the Medical Board is part of the

Juvenile Justice ( Care and Protection of Children ) Rule 2007 which came

into   being   with   effect   from   26/10/07   and   would   not   have   retrospective

application   to  the   present  case   in   which   the  date   of   commission   of  the

offence   is   10/10/05,   therefore,   in   the   light   of   Vikas   Chaudhary's   case

(supra)  and Ravi­u­Islam's  case (supra) and Manjeet's  case (supra)  the

appellant is  entitled to 2­3 years  of deduction  of age on  the  lower side

which would certainly make him a juvenile as on the date of commission of 
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                            5</span>

offence in this case.  Further in case of possibility of two views  with regard

to the age of the appellant the law favours the appellant as is held  R C

Lahoti   and   Brijesh   Kumar   AIR   2002   Supreme   Court   748    relied   on

behalf of the appellant.
</p>
<p id="p_5">        In view of the above I hold that the learned Juvenile Justice Board­II

did not properly appreciate the overall facts and circumstances of he case

to arrive at a correct conclusion as to the age of the accused.  The findings

of the Juvenile Justice Board in the impugned order that the appellant is

adult is set aside.   The appellant is declared a juvenile as on the date of

commission of offence.   The impugned order dated 07/02/09 is also set

aside.  Let the appellant be proceeded against by Juvenile Justice Board­II

with the co­juvenile accused persons.  Appeal is accordingly allowed.  The

appellant   to   appear   before   Juvenile   Justice   Board­II   at   10.00   a.m.   on

18/05/09.  Record of Juvenile Justice Board be returned alongwith a copy

of   this   judgment   in   appeal.  The   judgment   be   sent   to   the   server

(www.delhidistrictcourts.nic.in).The appeal filed be consigned to the record

room.
