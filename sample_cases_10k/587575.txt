<p id="p_1">	  Criminal Appeal No.2693 of 2008 is filed against the judgment and order of conviction and sentence  dated 23-9-2008 passed by the learned Special Judge, CBI Court  No.3,  at  Mirzapur, Ahmedabad, in Special Case  No.30 of 1998 whereby the appellant was sentenced to suffer RI for four years and to pay fine of Rs.1,000/-, in default to suffer further SI for six months for each of the offences punishable under Secs.466, 467, 468,  471 of <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_1">IPC</a>,  further under Secs.417, 418 and 420 of <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_2">IPC</a> and also under Sec.15 read with Sec.13(1)(d) of the <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_3">Prevention of Corruption Act</a>, 1988. All the sentences were ordered to run concurrently. 
</p><p id="p_2">	  Criminal Appeal No.2694 of 2008 is filed against the judgment and order of conviction and sentence  dated 23-9-2008 passed by the learned Special Judge, CBI Court  No.3,  at  Mirzapur, Ahmedabad, in Special Case  No.31 of 1998 whereby the appellant was sentenced to suffer RI for five years and to pay fine of Rs.1,000/-, in default to suffer further SI for six months for each of the offences punishable under Secs.466, 467, 468,  471 of <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_4">IPC</a>,  further under Secs.417, 418 and 420 of <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_5">IPC</a> and also under Sec.13(2) read with Sec.13(1)(d) of the <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_6">Prevention of Corruption Act</a>, 1988. All the sentences were ordered to run concurrently. 
</p><p id="p_3">	  Criminal Appeal No.2696 of 2008 is filed against the judgment and order of conviction and sentence  dated 23-9-2008 passed by the learned Special Judge, CBI Court  No.3,  at  Mirzapur, Ahmedabad, in Special Case  No.32 of 1998 whereby the appellant was sentenced to suffer RI for five years and to pay fine of Rs.1,000/-, in default to suffer further SI for six months for each of the offences punishable under Secs.466, 467, 468,  471 of <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_7">IPC</a>,  further under Secs.417, 418 and 420 of <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_8">IPC</a> and also under Sec.15 read with Sec.13(1)(d) of the <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_9">Prevention of Corruption Act</a>, 1988. All the sentences were ordered to run concurrently.
</p><p id="p_4">	  Cri.Misc.Appln.Nos.804 of 2010, 806 of 2010  and 807 of 2010 are filed in Criminal Appeal No.2693 of 2008, 2694 of 2008 and 2696 of 2008  respectively for releasing the applicant/appellant on bail.
</p><p id="p_5">	  The case of the prosecution in short is that three complaints being RC25(A)/98, 26(A)/98 and 27(A)/98 were registered against the appellant at C.B.I., Gandhinagar, inter alia alleging that the  appellant while serving as Development Officer with Life Insurance Corporation of India, Bhavnagar, made forgery and made false claims  in respect of persons, who are alive by showing them as dead by creating false documents in the names of wives and thereby tried to cheat the LIC. Upon registration of the complaints, the investigation was started and at the end of investigation, charge sheet were submitted against the appellant before the Court of Special Judge, CBI Court No.3, At Mirzapur, Ahmedabad.   The learned Special Judge thereafter framed charge against the accused. The charge was read over and explained to the accused. The accused pleaded not guilty to the charges and claimed to be tried. Hence, the prosecution was asked to prove the guilt against the accused.
</p><p id="p_6">	  To prove the guilt against the accused, prosecution examined several witnesses and has produced and relied upon several documentary evidence.
</p><p id="p_7">	  On submission of closing pursis by the prosecution, learned Special Judge recorded further statement of the accused under Sec.313<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_10"> of Code</a> of Criminal Procedure wherein the accused denied all the charges.  Upon affording opportunity of hearing to the learned advocates appearing for the respective parties, learned Special Judge, CBI Court No.3, at Mirzapur, Ahmedabad, delivered the impugned judgments convicting and sentencing the appellant as aforesaid in the earlier part of this judgment giving rise to prefer the present appeals.
</p><p id="p_8">	  When Cri.Misc.Applications for bail have come up for hearing, with the consent of learned advocates appearing for the respective parties, the appeals are taken up along with said applications for bail for final hearing today.
</p><p id="p_9">	  As common facts and law are involved in all these matters, they are heard together and are being decided by this common judgment.
</p><p id="p_10">	  Heard learned counsel for the appellant, Mr.N.D.Nanavaty for M/s Nanavaty Advocates and learned APP, Mr.L.R.Pujari for the respondent-State.
</p><p id="p_11">	  Learned counsel for the appellant-original accused, Mr.N.D.Nanavaty, has submitted that he is pressing these appeals only on the point of quantum of sentence. It is submitted that the appellant is a retired Principal and his two children are pursuing their studies while his daughter is on the verge of getting married. The appellant is shouldering the responsibility of maintaining his entire family in his retired life. It is further submitted that the appellant is suffering from schizophrenia and he took long treatment for the same from Dr.Rajesh Maniyar.  Learned Senior Counsel has taken this Court through the evidence of doctor, who was examined by the appellant before the Special Court. It is apparent from the evidence of this witness that the present appellant took long treatment for the said disease. As per the medical certificate issued by the Jail Dispensary, he also took treatment in jail.  It is further submitted that his jail conduct is also good. In view of the above, it is submitted that some leniency be shown towards the appellant while awarding sentence.
</p><p id="p_12">	  Learned APP, Mr.L.R.Pujari, has not disputed the facts narrated by the learned counsel for the appellant. He therefore has voluntarily told the Court that if legally entitled, he may be given benefit.
</p><p id="p_13">	  This Court has gone through the record pertaining to the case as also the submission made on behalf of the parties together with the impugned judgments and orders of conviction and sentence passed by the trial court.
</p><p id="p_14">	  It is to be noted that the learned advocate for the appellant has restricted his arguments only on the point of quantum of sentence. Hence, I would not like to reproduce or discuss the entire evidence which are on record as the same remained unchallenged. This Court is also in complete agreement with the reasons adopted and the conclusions arrived at by the learned trial court in the impugned judgment so far as the conviction of the present appellant is concerned. 
</p><p id="p_15">	  It is to be noted that the appellant is a retired Principal.  Two of his children are pursuing studies while the daughter is of marriageable age. He has the responsibility of maintaining his entire family. Further, the appellant is suffering from schizophrenia and has been under treatment for long as is clear from the evidence of doctor examined before the Special Court. He was under treatment in jail also and his jail conduct is good. Considering all these aspects, this Court is of the opinion that interest of justice will be met if the sentence imposed on the appellant is reduced to some extent. The appeals are therefore required to be partly allowed.
</p><p id="p_16">	  Thus, these three appeals are partly allowed. While confirming the conviction of the appellant-accused in each Special Case, the sentence imposed on the appellant in Special Case No.30 of 1998 is reduced from four years to two and half years while in Special Case Nos.31 and 32 of 1998, it is reduced from five years to two and half years.  The accused is entitled to benefit under Sec.428 of <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_11">Cr.P.C</a>. The impugned judgments and orders of conviction and sentence dated 23-9-2008 passed by the learned Special Judge, CBI Court  No.3,  at  Mirzapur, Ahmedabad, in Special Case  Nos.30, 31 and 32 of 1998 are modified to the aforesaid extent. Remaining part of the impugned judgments and orders including fine, etc. would remain unaltered.	
</p><p id="p_17">	  In view of the aforesaid disposal of main criminal appeals, Cri.Misc.Appln.Nos.804 of 2010, 806 and 807 of 2010 for bail do not survive and are disposed of accordingly. 
</p><p id="p_18">	  Office shall place a copy of this judgment in each matter.
