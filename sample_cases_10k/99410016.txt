                                 DATE:     31st January, 2019

 PER COURT:-

 1        All these civil applications are taken together for hearing

 since all these matters are arising out of acquisition made for

 Lower Dudhana Project. The lands, which are involved in these

                                   {3}             CA 11303 OF 2018 &amp; ORS


 mattes are from village Kedarwakdi.       The delay, which has

 occurred in filing the appeals by the claimants in the present

 matters ranges between minimum of 560 days to maximum of

 4819 days.



 2        It is commonly argued by the learned Counsel appearing

 for the respective applicants that delay has been caused mainly

 because of financial constraints and lack of awareness of period

 of limitation for filing the appeals. Further, it is also commonly

 submitted by the learned Counsel for the applicants that the

 applicants will not claim interest for the period of delay in the

 event of their success in appeals. It is further commonly argued

 that in some connected matters, this Court has condoned the

 delay of more than 2900 days and not only condoned the delay

 but subsequently the appeals have also been allowed and

 amount of compensation has been enhanced. The copies of all

 such orders passed in those matters are placed on record. The

 learned Counsel submitted that in all these matters this Court

 while condoning the delay has dis-entitled the applicants from

 claiming the interest for the period of delay and thereafter has

 decided the appeals on merits.



 3        The orders passed by this Court in Civil Application

                                            {4}                CA 11303 OF 2018 &amp; ORS


 No.2926 of 2013 in First Appeal Stamp No.1409 of 2013 with

 connected matters, the order passed in civil Application No.

 11899 of 2016 in First Appeal No.22434 of 2016 with connected

 matters, the order passed in First Appeal No.2733 of 2013 with

 connected appeals and the Judgment passed in First Appeal

 No.4083 of 2016 with connected appeals, are placed on record.

 Referring to the earlier orders passed by this Court and

 Judgments delivered in some appeals, the learned Counsel

 prayed for condoning the delay in the present matter.



 4        The learned Counsel appearing for the Acquiring Body,

 though have opposed for condoning the delay stating that huge

 delay has not been appropriately explained, have not disputed

 that in connected matters delay of more than 2900 days is

 condoned, and thereafter, the appeals have been decided and

 the compensation has been enhanced in those matters. In the

 alternative, it is contended by the learned Counsel that if this

 Court inclines to condone the delay, the appellants - claimants

 shall not be made entitled for the interest of the period of delay

 on the enhanced amount of compensation



 5        Considering          earlier   orders   passed    in    the     connected

 matters, it appears to me that same criteria will have to be

 applied while deciding the present matters. The reasons, which

 were assigned in the earlier applications were similar to the

 justification given in the present applications by the applicants.

 The reasons as are stated in the applications cannot be outrightly

 rejected. Moreover, the applicants - appellants have undertaken

 that they will not claim interest of the period of delay on the

 enhanced amount of compensation in the event of their success

 in the appeals .



 6        In view of above, the following order is passed:-
