FIR No. 296/15, PS Saket              State Vs. Sainuddin                        1 of 5 
                        BRIEF REASONS FOR SUCH DECISION :


</pre><p id="p_1">01.            Accused  Sainuddin  S/o Sh.  Jainuddin  has been charged  for offence 

U/s 379 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_4">IPC</a> upon allegation of having committed theft of complainant's black colour 

Nokia 114 mobile phone from his pocket on bus route no. 534 on 07.03.2015 at 

about 03:00 PM. Alternatively, he has been tried for offence U/s 411 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_5">IPC</a> for having 

dishonestly received or retained complainant's stolen mobile phone.

</p><p id="p_2">02.            Prosecution's   case   gathered   from   charge­sheet  reveals  that  upon 

information  vide  DD No. 49­B, PS Saket dated 07.03.2015, SI Amar Singh along­

with Ct. Narendra reached at Sheikh Sarai traffic signal where   complainant Sh. 

Manoj Kumar Chabra met them and produced accused Sainuddin along­with stolen 

Nokia phone for alleging theft of his mobile by accused. SI Amar Singh made his 

endorsement   upon   complaint   given   to   him   in   writing   and   prepared  tehrir  for 

offence(s)  U/s 379/411  <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_6">IPC</a>  which was sent to PS Saket through Ct. Narendra for 

registration of FIR.
</p>
<p id="p_3">03.            During   investigation,   SI   Amar   Singh   (IO)   prepared   site­plan   at   the 

instance of complainant and recorded his statement U/s 161 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_7">Cr.P.C</a>. Stolen mobile 

phone was seized and deposited in malkhana. Accused Sainuddin was arrested, 

produced in court and remanded to JC. After collecting sufficient evidence, SI Amar 

Singh   (IO)   finalized   investigation   and   prepared   charge­sheet   for   offence(s)   U/s 

379 /411 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_8">IPC</a> which was filed in court on 05.05.2015. 
</p>
<p id="p_4">FIR No. 296/15, PS Saket              State Vs. Sainuddin                                   2 of 5 
</p><p id="p_5"> 04.           Cognizance   of   offence   was   taken  and  accused  Sainuddin  was 

charged for offence U/s 379 /411 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_9">IPC</a> on 19.05.2015 to which he pleaded not guilty 

and claimed trial. 
</p>
<p id="p_6">05.           Prosecution   has   examined   three   witnesses   in   support   of   its   case. 

Complainant Sh. Manoj Chabra has entered the witness­box as PW­01    whereas 

police­witnesses Ct. Narendra and SI Amar Singh (IO) have deposed as PW­02 &amp; 

PW­03   respectively.  Copy  of  FIR   No.   296/15   and   DD No.49B   dated   07.03.2015 

were entered in a list filed by prosecution which was put to accused and documents 

being not disputed were exhibited as Ex. A­1 &amp; Ex. A­2.

</p><p id="p_7">06.           After   closure   of   prosecution   evidence,   accused  Sainuddin   was 

examined   U/s   313  (1)(b)  <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_10">Cr.P.C</a>.  and   has   not   disputed   the   allegation   and 

depositions of witnesses examined on record by prosecution. 

</p><p id="p_8">07.           Final submissions have been addressed by either side.

</p><p id="p_9">08.           Sh.  Narender   Kumar   Yadav,  ld.   APP   for   State   has   adverted  to 

testimonies of complainant and police­witnesses for seeking conviction of accused 

for offence U/s 379 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_11">IPC</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_10">09.           Sh.   Kishore   Kumar,   ld   LAC,   per   contra,  has  alluded   to   cross­

examination of complainant Sh. Manoj Kumar Chabra (PW­01) for submitting that 

no public­witness was inquired or joined by IO nor was any paper­work conducted 

at the spot for contending false implication of accused Sainuddin.


FIR No. 296/15, PS Saket            State Vs. Sainuddin                                  3 of 5 
</p><p id="p_11"> 10.            Having heard their rival submissions, it  would be prudent to allude to 

testimonies of witnesses examined by prosecution for adjudicating upon the guilt or 

innocence of accused.
</p>
<p id="p_12">11.            Complainant Sh. Manoj Kumar Chabra (PW­01) in his examination­in­

chief has deposed to be returning from Kalkaji temple by bus route no. 534 at about 

02:00  PM on  07.03.2015  when  two  boys informed him about theft  of his mobile 

phone.   He  has  identified  accused   Sainuddin   in   court  and  also   deposed  to   have 

chased him along­with two boys and apprehended   him near Sheikh Sarai Cycle 

stand   (forest   area).   Complaint   given   to   police   has   been   proved   as   Ex.   PW1/A, 

seizure   memo   of   mobile   phone   as   Ex.   PW   1/B   and   arrest   memo   and   personal 

search memo of accused as Ex. PW 1/C and Ex. PW 1/D. Case property i.e. Nokia 

Phone black colour produced by MHC(M) has been correctly identified as Ex. P­1.

</p><p id="p_13">12.            Upon being subjected to cross­examination by ld. LAC, complainant 

has reiterated to have chased and apprehended accused on the other side of road, 

near  cycle  stand   and  called  PCR  at around  2:45  PM  using  his other  red colour 

Nokia mobile phone. He also deposed about arrival of PCR at around 3:30 PM and 

to have taken back (recovered) his phone from accused before arrival of police.

</p><p id="p_14">13.            PWs    Ct.   Narender   and   SI   Amar   Singh   (IO)   have   corroborated   his 

testimonies and proved the complaint, seizure memo, arrest memo and personal 

search memo of accused as Ex. PW 1/A to Ex. PW 1/D.

<p id="p_15">
FIR No. 296/15, PS Saket               State Vs. Sainuddin                                   4 of 5 
</p><p id="p_16"> 14.            Testimonies   of   complainant   Sh.  Manoj   Kumar   Chabbra   and   police­

witnesses   has  remained   consistent   in   all   material   aspects   without   being   shaken 

during   cross­examination,  hence   inspires   the   confidence   of   court.   Accused 

Sainuddin   has   neither   disputed   the   allegation   nor   the   testimonies   of   witnesses 

examined on record. Prosecution has therefore successfully proved its allegation of 

theft of complainant's mobile phone  against  accused Sainuddin S/o Sh. Jainuddin 

and he accordingly stands convicted for offence U/s 379 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_12">IPC</a>.
