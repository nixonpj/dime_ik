ORDER ON THE POINT OF SENTENCE

Pre: Ld. APP for the state.

       Convict produced from JC.

       ld. APP submits that offence of such types are increasing day by

day.    Convict has been convicted only for the offences punishable u/s

of similar nature. On these grounds ld. APP submits that convict deserve

maximum punishment.



       Contrary to it, convict submits that he is aged about 23 years old.

He further submits that his mother and father has already expired leaving




                                                                          2
 behind a younger sister. He again submits that he is only one to look after

her sister.   He further submits that his sister is now living with his bua in

Faridabad.      He lives on footpath.         On these grounds he submits that

lenient view be taken at the time of awarding the sentence.

      Having given careful consideration to the submissions of ld. APP for

the State and convict as well.         Since, convict is very poor person and he

has younger sister to feed therefore, I am of the view that ends of justice

shall be met if convict Sanjay @ Sanju is sentenced to undergo 03 years

R.I. and fine of Rs.500/- for the offence u/s 392/ 34 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_26">IPC</a> and in default of

payment of fine he shall further undergo for 15 days S.I.;                to undergo 02

years R.I. for the offence u/s 411 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_27">IPC</a> ;           and further to undergo 01 year

R.I. and fine of Rs.300/- for the offence u/s 25 / 54/ 59 <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_28">Arms Act</a> and in

default of payment of fine he shall further undergo for 07 days S.I.

              Accordingly,    convict Sanjay @ Sanju is sentenced to
              undergo 03 years R.I. and fine of Rs.500/- for the offence
              u/s 392/ 34 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_29">IPC</a> and in default of payment of fine he shall
              further undergo for 15 days S.I.;

              to undergo 02 years R.I. for the offence u/s 411 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_30">IPC</a>; and

              further to undergo 01 year R.I. and fine of Rs.300/- for the

that so long as the contention of ld. Counsel for the accused that there are

minor type in nature, which are attributable due to the long duration of time

and memory of a human being. However, in case of Jaskaran Singh Vs

these affect the root of the case and leave an impression of

    It is the fundamental principle of law that in case of conviction of

          of a prudent man. The section is so worded as to
          provide for two conditions of mind, first, that in which a
          man feels absolutely certain of a fact, in other words,
          'believe it to exist' and secondly in which, though he

             extremely probable that a prudent man would under
            the circumstances act on the assumption of its

            the prudent man as an appropriate concrete standard
            by which to measure proof at the same time
            contemplates of giving full effect to be given to
            circumstances or condition of probability or
            improbability. It is this degree of certainty to be arrived
            where the circumstances before a fact can be said to
            be proved. A fact is said to be disproved when the
            court believes that it does not exist or considers its
            non-existence so probable in the view of a prudent
            man the fact is not proved, i.e. neither proved nor

            criminal disputes. It is something different from moral

<p id="p_46">25.   Having perused the case file very carefully and material available

on record it has come on record in the deposition of PW2 Raj Bhadur that

on 20.12.2014 at about 05:00 AM              he saw accused Sanjay @ Sanju

standing besides his bed whereas his associates (not arrested) were

standing at the door of his jhuggi.              Accused Sanjay was taking out

personal articles from the purse of Raj Kumar, which further being handed

over to his associates,       who were standing at the gate of the jhuggi.

Thereafter, PW2 Raj Bahadur raised hue and cry                        upon which his

associates ran away.       Raj Bahadur had tried to apprehend accused but

accused Sanjay @ Sanju took out a knife and put it on the person of Raj

Bahadur and threatened him. Thereafter, PW2 Raj Bahadur managed to

apprehend accused Sanjay after a scuffle with him.                        In this process

accused Sanjay @ Sanju gave beatings to Raj Bahadur with hands and

legs and fist blows.    PW2 further testified that accused had robbed from

him Rs.8000/-, Gold Ear Tops, One gold mangalsutra and two mobile

 phones make 'Zen' phone and 'Carbon' phone. He has also testified that

since police personnels were stationed near the market gate therefore, on

hearing noises they approached at the spot. Accused was apprehended.

Thereafter, on carrying out personal search of accused, he was found in

possession of 'Zen' phone which belonged to Raj Bahadur and one 'knife'.

However, two associates of accused managed to run away.         This witness

(PW2 Raj Bahadur) further deposed that police recorded his statement

vide Ex.PW2/A. Raj Bahadur had also shown the place of occurrence to

the police on which the site plan was prepared.     The sketch of the knife

was also prepared Ex.PW2/B. The knife was taken into possession vide

seizure memo Ex.PW2/C. The phone was taken into possession vide

seizure memo Ex.PW2/D.          PW2 Raj Bahadur had identified accused

correctly. Accused was arrested and personally searched vide arrest and

personal search memos Ex.PW2/E and Ex.PW6/F.           This witnes has also

identified the knife as Ex.P1 and 'Zen' phone as Ex.P2 belonging to him

and robbed by accused.      Testimony of this witness has also been fully

corroborated by PW4 Ct. Amarpal PW7 Elan Govan; PW10 Brij Kishore;

PW11 Rahul Kumar and PW13 SI Vinod Kumar.               All these witnesses

have categorically stated that early morning at around 04:50 a.m. or 5 a.m.

consideration the observations made in the above referred judgments, I

am of the view that prosecution has successfully proved its case beyond

reasons that on 20.12.2014 at around 05:00 a.m. accused Sanjay @

Sanju committed offence of robbery in Jhuggi no. G-142, Sarojini Nagar by

showing knife to the complainant PW2 Raj Bahadur. Only robbed 'Zen

phone' of complainant PW2 Raj Bahadur could be recovered from the

possession of accused Sanjay @ Sanju vide seizure memos Ex.PW2/D

and     knife was also recovered from him vide seizure memo of knife

Ex.PW2/C and the same has been identified in the court as Ex.P-1 .

Furthermore,     accused was apprehended at the spot red handed but his

associates had run away from the spot.         Besides, accused Sanjay @

Sanju     has also failed to give any satisfactory reply in the statement

recorded u/s 313 Cr. PC.

offences punishable u/s 397 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_66">IPC</a> that accused has used the weapon of

offence while committing the robbery precisely for the reasons that there

is no concrete proof on record for causing injury to PW2 Raj Bahadur.      It

is also very strange as to why PW2 has not been medically examined if he

was beaten by the accused as alleged PW2 in his deposition.           Again,

prosecution has failed to prove its case for the offence u/s 436 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_67">IPC</a> for
