<p id="p_1">     Petitioners, who have been arraigned                             as accused in

Crime No.23/2005 of Vanchiyoor Police Station, have preferred

this petition under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_1">Section 482</a> of                       the Code of Criminal

Procedure seeking to quash the above proceedings pending

against them in C.C.No.522/2006 on the file of the Additional

Chief Judicial Magistrate's Court, Trivandrum.                       Petitioners face

charge for offences punishable under <a href="/doc/1315856/" id="a_2">Sections 442</a>,<a href="/doc/267625/" id="a_3">324</a> and <a href="/doc/770961/" id="a_4">323</a>

read with <a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_5">Section 34</a> I.P.C in the above case.

</p><p id="p_2">     2. The prosecution case against the petitioners, which is

admittedly registered           at the instance of Smt. Sukesini Devi,

the defacto complainant, is that they trespassed into her house

on January, 22, 2005 at about 11 a.m and attacked her and

her sister by hitting them on their cheek.
</p>
<p id="p_3">     3. The learned counsel for the petitioners submits that

the above crime is nothing but a counter blast to the crime

registered against the defacto complainant in Crime No.22/2005

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                2</span>
CRL.M.C.A.NO.3068/06

of Vanchiyoor Police Station. In the said crime, the allegation

against Smt. Sukesini Devi and three others is that they had

committed    trespass    into the  residence of the petitioners

herein, and assaulted them and that too, in violation of the

prohibitory   order of injunction passed by this Court in

CRP.No.2520/2002.
</p>
<p id="p_4">      4. Anyhow, I do not propose       to deal with the above

contention at this stage particularly in view of the fact that in

both the cases, the police has reportedly filed final reports.

</p><p id="p_5">      5. I have carefully perused the materials placed before

me. In the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case, I am of

the view that the petitioners have to be directed to urge all

their  contentions before the trial court at the     appropriate

stage. If the petitioners are convinced that the present crime

registered   against    them is a    counter blast to the case

registered against the defacto complainant, I do not find any

reason why the said aspect cannot be highlighted before the

trial court. Further, I am unable    to assume that the learned

Magistrate will not advert to that aspect with reference to the

evidence that may be      adduced by the parties in the two

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                3</span>
CRL.M.C.A.NO.3068/06

cases.
</p>
<p id="p_6">      6. However, I am satisfied that the prayer made by the

learned counsel to grant exemption to        petitioners 1 and 2

from    their personal appearance     can be     granted.  I   am

persuaded to    take the above view since petitioners 1 and 2

are ladies. If a motion in this regard is made by petitioners 1

and 2, it shall be allowed by the learned Magistrate. However,

petitioners 1 and 2 shall appear before the learned Magistrate

as and when      their presence is absolutely essential for the

purpose of the trial.
</p>
<p id="p_7">      7. Similarly if a prayer is made on behalf of the petitioner

No.3 for exemption        from appearance, that shall also be

considered sympathetically by the learned Magistrate.

</p><p id="p_8">      Crl.M.C is disposed of with liberty to the petitioners to

raise all their contentions before the trial court.



</p><p id="p_9">                                       (A.K.BASHEER, JUDGE)
