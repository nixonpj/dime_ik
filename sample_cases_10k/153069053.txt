                    Mr. Sujash Ghosh Dostidar
                    Ms. Sankari Roy
                    Mr. Adnan Ahmed                 ... for the petitioner

                    Mr. Shuvanil Chakraborty
                                                    ... for the opposite party


</pre><p id="p_3">                    In this application, the petitioner in the revisional application has prayed for recording the

             death of the original plaintiff opposite party during the pendency of the revisional application and

             to substitute her heirs and legal representatives in the revisional application in her place.

</p><p id="p_4">                    From the copy of the application and the amended plaint filed before the learned trial Judge,

             as have been produced before this Court, there is no dispute about the death of the original plaintiff

             opposite party and the particulars of her heirs and legal representatives. Let, the copy of the

             amendment application filed before the learned trial Judge, as well as a copy of the amended plaint

             filed in the suit be kept on record.
</p>
<p id="p_5">                    Mr. Shuvanil Chakraborty, learned counsel appearing for the original deceased plaintiff

             opposite party submits that he has no instruction to represent the heirs and legal representatives of

             the deceased plaintiff before this Court, but in view of the amendment application and the amended
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                                    2</span>


plaint filed before the learned trial Judge, I do not find any scope to dispute the case as made out by

the petitioner in this application. The substitution application is otherwise in form, the heirs and

legal representatives of the deceased plaintiff opposite party are all major, sui juris and of sound

mind.
</p>
<p id="p_6">        Accordingly, the department is directed to necessary amendment in the revisional

application being CO 2881 of 2013 by recording the death of the plaintiff opposite party and by

substituting her heirs and legal representatives mentioned in paragraph of the application in her

stead and place.
</p>
<p id="p_7">        With the above directions, CAN 1905 of 2017 stands allowed.

        Since Mr. Chakraborty has no instruction to appear in the matter, the petitioner is directed

to serve a copy of the revisional application on the substituted opposite parties by speed post with

acknowledgement due. The petitioner may also serve a copy of the revisional application, together

with the copy of this order on the learned advocate representing the opposite parties in the suit

before the learned Court below, by way of personal service. The petitioner shall file an affidavit of

service on the next date of hearing.
</p>
<p id="p_8">        In spite of service of the revisional application, together with the copy of this order if, none

appears on behalf of the substituted opposite parties, the application may be decided in their

absence.
</p>
<p id="p_9">        Let, the revisional application appear on March 30, 2017.
