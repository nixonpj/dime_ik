Government servant is under suspension or in whose case

disciplinary proceedings are pending or contemplated for the

regard to the circumstances of the case, is of the view that such

disciplinary proceedings might result in the imposition of the

penalty of removal or dismissal from service, and in whose case

the prosecution is contemplated or may have been launched in a

court of law. The aforesaid Rule 50 of the Rules of 1996 and the

guidelines to its relevant extract is quoted herein below for ready

      the contrary before the expiry of the period of
      notice."
</p>
<p id="p_16">5.           Having heard the learned counsel for the petitioner,

this Court is satisfied that impugned order (Annex.7) dated

24.06.2014 and (Annex.8) dated 24.06.2014 do not deserve to

be interfered with by this Court in the present writ petition and the

writ petition is liable to be dismissed. The reasons are as follows.

</p><p id="p_17">6.           The accepting of the VRS application of the

petitioner vide Annex.3 dated 30.01.2014 in its clear terms was

to be become effective prospectively only from 01.08.2014. The

petitioner admittedly worked in the same position even after

30.01.2014, the date of issuing the order (Annex.3), upto the

date when he was placed under suspension on 24.06.2014. The

contention raised by the learned counsel for the petitioner that

pendency of disciplinary proceedings or suspension should be

prior to the date of acceptance of such VRS application, is not

borne out from the aforesaid Rule 50 and the Guidelines issued

by the State Government thereunder, referred to supra. For all

purposes, the acceptance of VRS application vide order

(Annex.3) dated 30.01.2014, was to become effective only

prospectively w.e.f. 01.08.2014 as stipulated by the petitioner

himself in his application, but before that date, if the petitioner

has   been    placed   under    suspension       on    24.06.2014       in
                                   S.B. CIVIL WRIT PETITION NO. 6370/2014.
</p><p id="p_18">                             Satish Kumar Sood Vs. State of Rajasthan &amp; Ors.

</p><p id="p_19">                                                     Order dated 18/09/2014

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                  6/7</span>

contemplation of an enquiry under Rule 16 of the CCA Rules,

1958, which might result in imposition of a major penalty, the

same cannot be ruled-out or excluded merely on the basis of the

contention that voluntary retirement became effective on the date

of its acceptance order dated 30.01.2014 (Annex.3), thoughit

was to become effective on 01.08.2014. The reference to the

newspaper reports on the basis of which the purported

disciplinary action has been taken against the petitioner and the

explanation furnished by the petitioner vide Annex.6 dated

12.05.2014, also prima-facie shows that the allegations or the

charges sought to be levelled against him are of serious nature

that while working as Assistant Director, in the              respondent

Department, he made false payments of certain taxi bills to the

extent of Rs.3 lacs and odd, on the basis of forged bills for taxis

hired by the said Department, the petitioner in the said

explanation, has even submitted that he is ready to reimburse

the total cost of such taxis hired by the State Government at his

own end.
</p>
<p id="p_20">7.           Be that as it may, this Court would not like to go into

the merits of such charges and explanation thereof furnished by

the petitioner at this stage, lest it affects the petitioner adversely

during the enquiry proceedings. However, the contention raised

by the learned counsel for the petitioner that the pendency of

such disciplinary action should be prior to the date of acceptance
                                        S.B. CIVIL WRIT PETITION NO. 6370/2014.
</p><p id="p_21">                                  Satish Kumar Sood Vs. State of Rajasthan &amp; Ors.

</p><p id="p_22">                                                          Order dated 18/09/2014

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                       7/7</span>

       of VRS application even though the same is to have a

       prospective effect, cannot be accepted. The acceptance was to

       be become effective only on 01.08.2014 and before that if on

       account of initiation of disciplinary enquiry, the petitioner was

       placed under suspension on 24.06.2014, it cannot be said that

       the acceptance of VRS application cannot be withdrawn or

       voluntary retirement cannot be withheld and made inoperative

       w.e.f. 01.08.2014. Therefore, this Court finds no merit in the writ

       petition and the petitioner must face the disciplinary action

       initiated by the respondent- Department.

</p><p id="p_23">       8.          This Court is, therefore, satisfied that no interference

       is called for in the impugned orders and the writ petition filed by

       the petitioner lacks merit and the same is hereby dismissed with

       no order to as costs. A copy of this order be sent to the

       concerned parties forthwith.
