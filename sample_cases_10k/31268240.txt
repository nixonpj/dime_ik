</p><p id="p_3">                       “We fully subscribe to the above exposition, the eventual
                      purpose of an adjudication being to ensure complete justice

   between the parties.    The decision in <a href="/doc/109715927/" id="a_1">State of Kerala &amp;
   Ors. vs. P.T. Thomas</a> [(2005) 12 SCC 347] is distinguishable
   on facts, and thus, is of no avail to the respondent No.6.

    In the above view of the matter, the orders dated
   26.3.2012 terminating the services of the applicants/writ
   petitioners are hereby quashed and they are entitled to all
   consequential benefits, in terms of the order dated
   16.4.2013, referred to hereinabove.”


    The     aforesaid    direction     was      confirmed    by     this   Court.      In

consequence      thereof,    concerned         employees     were    reinstated       and

allowed to join their duties.
</p>
<p id="p_4">
    Mr.          Bhattacharya,      learned       advocate        submits      that    by

communication dated         18.7.2018, Dr. Arti Mathur and Dr. Madhulika

Naithani, lecturers, were compulsorily retired by the Management of

LBS PG College, Tilak Nagar, Jaipur.              In his submission, said order

of compulsory retirement was only on account of non-receipt of                        the

amount of grant-in-aid from the State authorities. This submission

is seriously disputed by Mr. Puneet Jain, learned advocate for the

Management.
</p>
<p id="p_5">
    Without      going    into   the    rival      contentions        raised    by    the

parties, in our view, the appropriate remedy for the applicants to

ventilate     their     grievance      against      the     order     of     compulsory

retirement would not be by way of an interim application in the

disposed    of    matter.    They    are       entitled     to    take     recourse    to

independent remedies        as are available to them in law.


    As and when such petition is filed, the fact that they had

approached this Court and the matter was pending before this Court
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                     3</span>



shall be considered in proper perspective if the issue of latches

in   approaching   the   concerned   court   or   authority   arises   for

consideration.
</p>
<p id="p_6">     With the aforesaid observations, this M.A. is disposed of.

     Pending applications, if any, shall also stands disposed of.
