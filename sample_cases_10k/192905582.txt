         part of conspiracy alleged to have been hatched by all the
         accused persons. The main allegation against the applicant is
         that the applicant was present at the time of incident,
         however, none of the injured persons has stated that the
         applicant has given any blow to the injured. He would submit

         is nowhere connected with the accused, who have assaulted
         the injured persons.

         applicant did not establish that the applicant has actively
         participated in commission of the offence and he had
         instigated other accused to assault the persons, who were
         skinning the cow. It is not the case of the prosecution that the
         applicant was in contact with any of the police officers on the
         date of incident or in contact with other accused, who have
         assaulted the injured.

         the witnesses including injured witnesses that they were
         beaten by the applicant. It is not the case of any of the
         witnesses including police witnesses that when those persons
         were being beaten up by number of persons including those
         referred in the FIR, the applicant has accompanied them. It is
         not the case of any of the witnesses that the applicant did
         remain in contact with another accused by telephone and,
         therefore, the case put forward by the prosecution that the
         applicant permitted and instigated the assailants to continue
         illegal activities, are baseless.

         vehemently submitted that the applicant has been wrongly
         roped in the offence with the reasons best known to the
         Investigating Agency since no material whatsoever has been
         collected by the Investigating Agency. He would submit that it
         is not the case of the prosecution that at any of the places,
         where the injured persons were beaten, the applicant has
         actively participated and accompanied the assaulters.

         prosecution in the charge-sheet that a conspiracy was hatched
         by him along with those police personnels, who have been
         arraigned as accused in the present case, to commit such
         offence since the injured were involved in slaughtering the
         cows.
</p><p id="p_22">                        He would submit that investigation is over and
         charge-sheet is filed and therefore, there is no question of
         tampering with the evidence. There are more than 338
         witnesses and, therefore, trial is likely to take some longer
         time and therefore, considering the principle laid down by the
         Hon'ble Apex Court in various decisions with regard to grant
         of bail of an accused, who has not been tried, the applicant
         may be released on bail.

         injured by slaughtering the cows. She would submit that

         procession was allowed to continue and the innocent persons

         or indirect role of the applicant, which would establish that
         the applicant has instigated the assaulters and was in contact

         particularly in the present district, which is known for lions

         number of persons gathered at the place (village : Mota

         dead bodies. When they started abusing those persons and
         misbehaving them, one Sarvaiya informed Police Control
         Room at Ahmedabad. Control Room of Ahmedabad informed
         the PSO of Una Police Station, who recorded the entry in the

         the further statement of the complainant, it appears that he
         has changed his version, instead of Najabhai Danabhai, he
         states that some other person has informed about the dead
         cow. It also appears that the Veterinary officer had visited the

         opinion, whether the applicant is part of conspiracy or not, is
         required to be established by the prosecution after leading
         evidence before the trial court. When none of the witnesses
         have stated that the applicant was present at any of the places
         including Una Bus stand or police station, in my opinion, the
