ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">          This revision petition has been preferred challenging

the order dated 26.3.2009 vide which Ld. Trial Court dismissed



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                              1</span>
 the complaint under Sec.203 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_1">CrPC</a> finding no sufficient grounds

to proceed against the accused persons for the offence

punishable under Sec.48(2) of <a href="/doc/679372/" id="a_2">Delhi Rent Control Act</a>.

</p><p id="p_2">2.         TCR was summoned and perused. I have heard Sh.

S.D. Ansari, ld. Counsel for the revisionist and carefully gone

through the Trial Court Record.
</p>
<p id="p_3">3.         Sh. S.D. Ansari, ld. Counsel for the revisionist has

submitted that ld. Trial Court has failed to appreciate that the

complainant was not required to prove his ownership to establish

his case or to prove the sub-tenancy of accused No.2 for the

reason that law is well settled that landlord is not required to

prove his ownership and once a tenant always a tenant. Ld.

Counsel for the revisionist has further contended that ld. Trial

Court had no reason to disbelieve the statement of complainant

that the premises shown as red in the site plan of property

No.2185, Ground Floor, Pahari Bhojia, Gali Nal Wali, Turkman

Gate, Delhi has been sub-let to accused No.2 by accused No.1

and what Ld. Trial Court was required to do after recording of

pre-summoning evidence, was to issue the summons to them and

it was for the accused persons to prove that it was not a case of

sub-letting. It has been further contended that complainant was

only required to prove that accused No.1 was a tenant under his

father and after the death of his father, the property devolved on



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                  2</span>
 him and to further prove that the premises has been sub-let by

the tenant to accused No.2 for monetary consideration which was

established from the testimony of the complainant on oath. It

has been further contended that in a case of sub-letting, if the

notice is sent by the Court and received by the sub-tenant, that is

sufficient to establish sub-letting but without sending the

process, ld. Trial Court dismissed the complaint though the

prima facie case was established by the complainant. It has been

prayed that order dated 26.3.2009 be quashed and accused

persons be ordered to be summoned for committing the offence

punishable under Sec.48(2) of <a href="/doc/679372/" id="a_3">Delhi Rent Control Act</a>.

</p><p id="p_4">4.         I have considered the submissions made by ld.

Counsel for the revisionist and carefully gone through the Trial

Court Record. Before proceeding with the merits of the case, it

is necessary to refer to the provisions of <a href="/doc/1684171/" id="a_4">Section 48(2)</a> of Delhi

Rent Control Act which provides that if any tenant sub-lets,

assigns otherwise parts with the possession of the whole or part

of any premises in contravention of the provisions of clause (b)

of the proviso to sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/367290/" id="a_5">Section 14</a>, he shall be

punishable with fine which may extend to one thousand rupees.

<a href="/doc/1225833/" id="a_6">Section 49(2)</a> of Delhi Rent Control Act stipulates that no Court

shall take cognizance of an offence punishable under this Act,

unless the complaint in respect of the offence has been made



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                 3</span>
 within three months from the date of the commission of the

offence.
</p>
<p id="p_5">5.         In the instant case, counterfoil of rent receipt placed

on record by the complainant to prove that accused No.1 was

tenant in respect of the portion shown as red in the site plan, is

dated 6.4.1995 and stated to have been issued by the father of the

complainant. In the complaint, in para 2, it is specifically

mentioned that accused No.1 was paying rent to late father of the

complainant and after his demise, to the complainant. Thereafter,

there is no averment as to whether the complainant had been

collecting rent from the tenant prior to his visit to the said shop

on 26.11.2008. There is absolutely nothing on record to show

that accused no.1 remained tenant in the shop shown in red in the

site plan till October, 2008 or sub-letting was done within three

months prior to filing of this complaint on 15.1.2009. <a href="/doc/1225833/" id="a_7">Section

49(2)</a> of Delhi Rent Control Act creates specific bar that no

cognizance can be taken unless the complaint in respect of the

offence has been made within three months from the date of

commission of offence. In the entire complaint, the date of

commission of offence is not mentioned but only the date of visit

by the complainant. As the complainant failed to bring on record

that the alleged offence was committing within three months

prior to filing of the complaint on 15.1.2009 and prior to that



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                 4</span>
 accused No.1 was tenant in possession of the suit property and

paying rent to him, ld. Trial Court had rightly come to the

conclusion that the penal provisions are to be strictly construed

and it is the duty of the Court to see that ingredients of the

offence for which summoning of the accused has been prayed

are fully brought on record. Ld. Trial Court has disbelieved the

statement of the complainant tendered by way of affidavit only

after assessing in detail the material brought on record i.e. the

rent receipt of the year 1995 and thereafter formed an opinion

that there was no sufficient ground to proceed against the

accused persons. The order dated 26.3.2009 does not suffer from

any illegality or infirmity. Rather the averments made in the

complaint and the evidence adduced at the stage of pre-

summoning, was wholly insufficient for summoning the accused

for the offence complained of.
</p>
<p id="p_6">6.         In view of above discussion, the present revision

petition is dismissed. TCR alongwith copy of the order be sent

back and revision file be consigned to Record Room.
