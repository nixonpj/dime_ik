ORAL
ORDER</pre>
 
	  

<p id="p_1">State
	has filed this application against the order dated 10th
	July 2009 passed by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, City
	Sessions Court No9, Ahmedabad, in Criminal Miscellaneous Application
	No.1913 of 2009 granting bail to the respondent-accused.
</p>	 


	  

<p id="p_2">Originally,
	criminal complaint was registered against the respondent-accused
	with Ellisbridge Police Station being I-C.R. No.375 of 2009 for the
	offences punishable under <a href="/doc/92983/" id="a_1">Sections 306</a> and <a href="/doc/112749/" id="a_2">114</a> of the Indian Penal
	Code.  
</p>	
	 


	  

<p id="p_3">The
	respondent-accused came to be arrested on 23rd June 2009
	and was sent in judicial custody on 24th June 2009.
	Thereafter, on 25th June 2009 the respondent-accused
	preferred regular bail application, which came to be allowed by the
	learned Additional Sessions Judge, City Sessions Court No.9,
	Ahmedabad. 
</p>	
	  

<p id="p_4">Heard
	Mr. R.C. Kodekar, learned Additional Public Prosecutor for the
	applicant-State. He has contended that the learned Judge has not
	considered the seriousness of the offence committed by the
	respondent-accused. He has also contended that there is no reason
	for the complainant to falsely implicate the respondent-accused. He
	has also contended that the learned Judge has not considered the
	evidence and without looking into the seriousness of the offence,
	exercised the discretionary powers in favour of the
	respondent-accused and this is a fit case to cancel the bail granted
	to the respondent-accused. 
</p>	
	 


	  

<p id="p_5">I
	have gone through the papers produced before me and also gone
	through the order passed by the Trial Court. Today Mr. Kodekar is
	unable to convince this Court that on which ground the bail granted
	to the respondent-accused to be cancelled. It appears that learned
	Judge has considered the whole evidence, which
	was produced before him, and after going through the evidence on
	record, the learned
	Judge has passed the reasoned order enlarging
	the respondent-accused on regular bail. 
</p>	
	 


	  

<p id="p_6">In
	view of above, in my opinion, no case is made out by the applicant
	to cancel the bail granted to the respondent-accused by the learned
	Additional Sessions Judge, City Sessions Court No.9, Ahmedabad and,
	therefore, no interference is required to be called for by this
	Court. In view of above, the application is required to be dismissed
	and is dismissed hereby. Rule is discharged.
</p>
