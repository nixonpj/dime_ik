and from 6.4.06 to 24.4.06 respectively. Defendants have not

informed the plaintiff regarding the shooting of serial no. 29

party without giving any prior notice to the plaintiff and that

serial no. 34 had commenced w.e.f. 29.6.06. On account of

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                5</span>

personal privity of contract between the plaintiff and

defendant No. 2. Defendants had admitted the agreement dt.

25.2.05 as entered into with the plaintiff. The defendants has

alleged that they have never committed any breach of

contract and it was the plaintiff who had violated the terms

and conditions of the agreement. Plaintiff had refused to

provide the catering services at places like Mumbai and

Manali. Plaintiff had adopted the policy of pick and choose,

as he used to provide catering services only for those serials

which were profitable to him and opted out of catering for the

serials which were shot on distant places. Plaintiff had also

refused to provide the catering services for the serial no. 34.

It is the plaintiff who had violated the terms and conditions of

the agreement as is evident from his letter dt. 26.6.06

whereby he wants to have increase in the rate by 25% for

doing story no. 34. On account of the refusal by the plaintiff

for providing catering services the defendants had to incur the

additional sum of Rs. 3.5 lacs to Rs. 3.75 lacs per story.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                 6</span>

agreement under her personal capacity. Plaintiff had violated

the terms and conditions of the agreement and had refused to

cater at places like Mumbai, Manali which is evident from the

letter of the plaintiff dt. 26.6.06 which is Ex. PW1/2. Plaintiff

was duly intimated about the shooting in the serials at

Mumbai and Manali much in advance. Plaintiff had not

suffered any loss and had not suffered any mental agony and

there is no outstanding bill amounting to Rs. 26,000/- against

defendant.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                10</span><p id="p_20">

</p><p id="p_21">            In cross examination she had deposed that plaintiff

by sending any notice in writing despite the refusal of the

and 13. Plaintiff has not refused to provide catering services

of story No. 13 vide letter Ex. PW1/2. She is not sure whether

there is any document available with the defendant No. 1

regarding the payment of bill dt. 27.5.06 amounting to Rs.

26,000/-.
</p>
<p id="p_22"><span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">ISSUE NO. 1</span>

The onus to prove this issue was upon the defendants. Ld.

counsel for the defendants has argued that the suit is bad for

misjoinder of necessary parties as the defendant No. 2 was

just a Project Manager and there was no personal privity of

contract between the plaintiff and the defendant No. 2.

Agreement Ex.PW1/1 shows that this has been signed by the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                11</span>

defendant No. 2 for and on behalf of the defendant No. 1. In

my view as the defendant No. 2 has signed the agreement on

behalf of the defendant No. 1, so his presence is necessary in

this case to decide the matter in controversy between the the

parties. In my view the suit of the plaintiff is not bad for mis

joinder of the necessary parties. Accordingly, this issue is

decided against the defendants and in favour of the plaintiff.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">ISSUE NO. 2,3 AND 4</span>

</p><p id="p_23">         These issues are taken together as they have to be

decided on the basis of same evidence. The onus to prove

these issues was upon the plaintiff.
</p>
<p id="p_24">         It is the case of the plaintiff that he was not informed

about the shotting of the Serial No. 29 and 32. In affidavit

Ex.P1, plaintiff has deposed that defendant had not informed

him regarding the shooting of serial No. 29 and 32 as to when

and where they are to be shoot and later on he came to know

that the said shooting were held at Mumbai and Manali. This

deposition of PW1 is not supported by PW2. PW2 is the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                               12</span>

material witness as he had worked with the defendant No. 1

and it was his duty to locate site or space to the plaintiff for

cooking and dining area.      In cross examination, he had

deposed that plaintiff had not rendered the catering services

in Mumbai and Himachal despite information given by him.

He has also deposed that the plaintiff was given advance

information regarding the Mumbai and Himachal stories.

PW2 has supported the case of the defendant that the plaintiff

was informed about the dates of shooting of serial No. 29 and

32 at Mumbai and Manali. In view of the evidence of PW2 the

plaintiff has failed to prove his case that he was not informed

about the shooting of serial No. 29 and 32 well in advance.

</p><p id="p_25">         Plaintiff has claimed Rs. 9,00,000/- as damages for

loss of profits, Staff salary, interest on loan and other

associated expenditures on the stories No. 29 and 32 and 34.

</p><p id="p_26">         PW1 in his cross examination has deposed that he

has no permanent staff. He do not maintain regular books of

account. He cannot tell how much profit he makes for the first
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                                   13</span>

serial. He had not filed any income tax return for the period

200506, 2006-07. He had not arrangement with any of the

caterer in Manali and in Mumbai. He had taken a loan in the

year 2004-05 which was his personal loan and not in

connection with the agreement with the defendants.

</p><p id="p_27">          Plaintiff has not placed on record any documents to

prove the salary of the staff and for other associated

expenditures incurred by him for the serial No. 29, 32 and 34.

</p><p id="p_28">          The evidence of PW1 in his cross examination

proves that the loan was his personal loan and it has nothing

to do with the agreement with the defendants.

</p><p id="p_29">          In view of the facts that plaintiff do not maintain

regular books of account and he cannot tell how much profit

he makes for the first serial and in the absence of income tax

return, I am of the opinion that the plaintiff has failed to prove

the fact of his loss of profit.
</p>
<p id="p_30">          In view of the above discussions, plaintiff has failed

to prove that he has suffered a loss of Rs. 3,00,000/- per story
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">                                14</span>

and thereby plaintiff is not entitled to recover Rs. 9,00,000/-

as damages from the defendant.
</p>
<p id="p_31">         Plaintiff has also claimed Rs. 3,00,000/- as damages

for mental agony and hardship faced by the plaintiff. The

plaintiff has deposed in cross examination that he has not

lodged any written complaint with the defendant about being

not awarded serial No. 29 and 32. The letter Ex.PW1/2 which

is sent to the defendants after the shooting of the serial No.

29 and 32 did not contain any averments which would show

that he has suffered hardship and mental agony due to the

non-awarding of serial No. 29 and 32 for catering to him. It is

admitted fact that plaintiff has provided the services of

catering to the defendants for serial No. 30, 31 and 33, which

also supports the case of the defendants that the plaintiff has

adopted the policy of pick and choose for providing the

catering services.
</p>
<p id="p_32">         In view of these facts I am of the opinion that plaintiff

has failed to prove that he has suffered mental agony,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                                  15</span>

hardship, so in my view plaintiff is not entitled for Rs.

3,00,000/- as claimed by him.
</p>
<p id="p_33">           Plaintiff has also demanded Rs. 26,000/- as

outstanding against the bill No. 1392 dt. 27.5.06. This bill has

not been proved on record by the plaintiff and plaintiff has

also failed to produce any evidence on record to show that to

which of the transaction this bill relates to.     In my view,

plaintiff has also failed to prove that he is entitled for the

recovery of Rs. 26,000/- from the defendant.

</p><p id="p_34">         In view of the above discussions, issues No. 2,3 and

4 are decided against the plaintiff and in favour of the

defendants.
</p>
<p id="p_35"><span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">ISSUE NO. 5</span>

</p><p id="p_36">         In view of the aforesaid findings on the issues No. 2,

3 and 4, as the plaintiff is not entitled for the recovery of

damages of Rs. 12,26,000/-, so the plaintiff is also not entitled

to any interest as claimed by him. This issue accordingly

decided against the plaintiff.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">                               16</span><p id="p_37">

RELIEF

         In view of the findings on the aforesaid issues, suit

of the plaintiff is dismissed. No orders as to cost. Decree

sheet be prepared. File be consigned to Record Room.
