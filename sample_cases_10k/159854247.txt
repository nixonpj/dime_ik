                           ORAL JUDGMENT</pre>



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                Page 1 of 8</span>
<p id="p_1">         C/SCA/18805/2014                                 JUDGMENT




       By way of this petition, the petitioner-detenue has
challenged the order of detention passed by the Police
Commissioner, Ahmedabad city, dated 4 th September 2014, in
exercise of powers conferred on him under sub-section (1) of
Section 3 of the Gujarat Prevention of Anti-Social Activities Act,
1985 (for short, 'the PASA Act') and has also prayed for an
order to set him free from detention.
</p>

<p id="p_2">       The order of detention along with the grounds supplied to
the detenu are suggestive of the fact that the petitioner has
been detained labelling him as a "dangerous person" as
provided under sub-section (2) of Section 3 of the PASA Act.
The grounds of detention are also suggestive of the fact that
the detaining authority has taken into consideration two cases,
one, registered with the Danilimda Police Station vide I-CR
No.1 of 2014 for the offence punishable under Sections 324,
323, 294B read with <a href="/doc/112749/" id="a_1">Section 114</a> of the Indian Penal Code and
Section 135(1) of the Gujarat Police Act, and second,
registered with the Ishanpur Police Station vide I-CR No.111 of
2014 for the offence punishable under <a href="/doc/724142/" id="a_2">Sections 324</a>, <a href="/doc/1011035/" id="a_3">323</a>, <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_4">294B</a>
read with <a href="/doc/112749/" id="a_5">Section 114</a> of the Indian Penal Code and Section
135(1) of the Gujarat Police Act. The status of the F.I.Rs. has
been     shown        as   "pending     the    court"   and   "pending
investigation" respectively. The subjective satisfaction as
reflected from the grounds are to the effect that the detenue is
indulging in the offences falling within<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_6"> Chapter XVII of the
Indian Penal Code</a>. His highhanded actions create a situation of
disturbance of public order. On these grounds, the Police
Commissioner has ordered detention of the petitioner.
</p>

<p id="p_3">        C/SCA/18805/2014                            JUDGMENT



     Mr.Chetan Raval, the learned advocate appearing for the
detenue submitted that the order of detention is malicious,
unjust and illegal. Learned counsel submitted that there is no
material available with the detaining authority to indicate that
the detenue is a dangerous person as defined under Section
2(c) of the PASA Act nor there is any material or antecedent to
show that he is a habitual offender and involved in antisocial
activities prejudicial to the maintenance of public order. It is
his case that this order of detention is nothing but abuse of
power at the hands of the Police Commissioner.
</p>

<p id="p_4">     On the other hand, this petition has been vehemently
opposed by Ms.Nisha Thakore, the learned AGP appearing for
the State. According to Ms.Thakore, there are sufficient
grounds to issue the detention order. Learned AGP has
submitted that the detention order was issued after careful
consideration of the materials available before the detaining
authority.
</p>

<p id="p_5">     Having heard the learned counsel appearing for the
parties and having gone through the materials on record, the
only question that falls for my consideration is, whether the
order of detention deserves to be quashed.
</p>

<p id="p_6">     I am concerned only with the question as to whether
there are sufficient grounds and materials available to detain
the detenue in prison without trial in exercise of powers
conferred under Section 3(2) of the PASA Act, describing him
as a 'dangerous person' under Section 2(c) of the Act on the
basis of the F.I.Rs. registered against the detenue.
</p>

<p id="p_7">        C/SCA/18805/2014                           JUDGMENT



     On plain reading of the allegations levelled in the F.I.Rs.,
by any stretch of imagination, it cannot be said that the
incidents in question were such which disturbed the public
order, peace and tranquility.
</p>

<p id="p_8">     I am of the view that merely because two offences are
registered under<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_7"> the Indian Penal Code</a> that by itself is not
sufficient to come to the conclusion that the public order has
been disturbed.
</p>

<p id="p_9">     At this stage, it would be expedient to quote the
judgment rendered by the Division Bench of this Court in the
matter of Ramesh Vandha Modhwadiya through brother,
Laxmanbhai Vandha, reported in 2009(3) GLH 296, wherein
in paragraph 11, the Division Bench has observed as under:-
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_1">     "11. PASA Act has been enacted with a clear object
     to prevent the crime and to protect the society
     from    anti-social  elements     and    dangerous
     characters against perpetration of crime by
     placing them under detention for such a duration
     as would disable them from resorting to
     undesirable criminal activities. The provisions of
     the Act are intended to deal with habitual
     criminals, dangerous and desperate outlaws, who
     are so hardened and incorrigible that the ordinary
     provisions of the penal laws and the mortal fear of
     punishment for crime are not sufficient deterrents
     for them. Law is well settled that the power under
     the Act should be exercised with restraint and
     great caution. In order to pass an order of
     detention under the Act against any person, the
     detaining authority must be satisfied that he is a
     `dangerous person' within the meaning of Section
     2(c) of the PASA Act, who habitually commits, or
     attempts to commit or abets the commission of
     any of the offences punishable under Chapter XVI
     or Chapter XVII of the Penal Code or any of the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                            Page 4 of 8</span>
  C/SCA/18805/2014                         JUDGMENT



offences punishable under Chapter V of the Arms
Act as according to sub-section (4) of Section 3 of
the Act it is such `dangerous person' who for the
purpose of <a href="/doc/1507082/" id="a_8">Section 3</a> shall be deemed to be a
person "acting in any manner prejudicial to the
maintenance of public order" against whom an
order of detention may lawfully be made. Further,
subsection (1) of <a href="/doc/1507082/" id="a_9">Section 3</a> confers power on the
State Government and a District Magistrate or a
Commissioner of Police under the direction of the
State Government to detain a person on being
satisfied that it is necessary to do so with a view
to preventing him from acting in any manner
prejudicial to the maintenance of `public order'.
</blockquote><p id="p_10">The explanation attached to sub-section (4) of
<a href="/doc/1507082/" id="a_10">Section 3</a> reproduced above in the foregoing para
contemplates that `public order' shall be deemed
to have been affected adversely or shall be
deemed likely to be affected adversely inter alia if
any of the activities of any person referred to in
sub-section (4) directly or indirectly, are causing
or is likely to cause any harm, danger or alarm or
feeling of insecurity among the general public or
any section thereof or a grave or widespread
danger to life, property or public health. Sub-
section (4) of <a href="/doc/1507082/" id="a_11">Section 3</a> also provides that for the
purpose of <a href="/doc/1507082/" id="a_12">Section 3</a>, a person shall be deemed to
be `acting in any manner prejudicial to the
maintenance of public order' when such person is
a `dangerous person' and engaged in activities
which affect adversely or are likely to affect
adversely the maintenance of public order. It,
therefore, becomes necessary to determine
whether besides the person being a `dangerous
person' his alleged activities fall within the ambit
of the expression `public order'. A distinction has
to be drawn between law and order and
maintenance of public order."
</p>
<p id="p_11">In paragraphs 15 and 16, the Division Bench has, after
considering the factual position on the record, observed
as under:-
</p>
<p id="p_12">"15. We find that even going by the F.I.R. on the
date of incident, it is alleged that the dentenu's

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                      Page 5 of 8</span>
  C/SCA/18805/2014                      JUDGMENT



father had a pistol with him. There is nothing to
show that he had fired with the pistol or caused
any harm to anybody. Possession of pistol by
detenu's father without license may be an offence
so far as father is concerned and not the son, the
detenu. Further, it is also to be noted that though
they had disturbed the programme, later, the
programme continued without any disturbance.
Further, they had not caused any harm or bodily
injury to anybody present there. Even in the F.I.R.
it is stated that they had not caused any serious
harm or injury to anybody. At the most, in our
view, the incident occurred on that day might have
raised problems of law and order, but we find it
impossible to see that they impinged public order.
No motive was also attributed against the detenu
for creating such an incident. In order to bring the
activities of a person within the expression of
acting    in  any    manner     prejudicial  to  the
maintenance of public order to fall out and extend
and reach of the alleged activities must be of such
a nature the ordinary law cannot deal with it or
prevent the subversive activities affecting the
society. In our view, those incidents are not
sufficient to take action against the detenu under
the provisions of the PASA Act. We are, therefore,
unable to agree that the incident in question
occurred on 10.02.2008 would be sufficient to
disturb the tempo of life of the community so as to
disturb the public tranquility and public order.
</p>
<p id="p_13">16. The incident referred to in the F.I.R. had
occurred on 10.02.2008 and criminal case was
registered against the detenu and others and are
being tried for the offences punishable under
<a href="/doc/180217/" id="a_13">Sections 506(2)</a> and <a href="/doc/112749/" id="a_14">114</a> of the Indian Penal Code,
Section 135 of the Bombay Police Act and <a href="/doc/1961417/" id="a_15">Section
25</a>(1-B)A.B.) of the <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_16">Arms Act</a>. Registration of cases
and trial undertaken would be sufficient enough to
contain those situations, but not sufficient to
detain a person, and to characterise him as a
`dangerous person' curtailing his life and liberty.
There is nothing to show that the detenu is a
habitual offender, apart from the solitary incident
occurred on 10.02.2008. May be, a solitary act has


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                    Page 6 of 8</span>
        C/SCA/18805/2014                               JUDGMENT



     the propensity of affecting the tempo of life and
     public tranquility, but the incident occurred on
     10.02.2008 will not fall under that category. The
     detaining authority could not point out any other
     incident in which he was involved or a criminal
     case registered against him. Even the three
     witnesses have also not filed any complaints
     against the detenu. The solitary incident pointed
     out in the F.I.R. and the reach and potentiality of
     that incident cannot be said to be so grave to
     disturb even the tempo or normal life of the
     community in the locality or disturb general peace
     and tranquility or create a sense of alarm and
     insecurity in the locality. The mere fact that the
     order narrates the detenu as a `dangerous person'
     without any materials, a conclusion cannot be
     drawn that the detenu is a `dangerous person',
     unless the incident has reach and potentiality, and
     a single incident pointed out as such would not
     indicate that the detenu is a habitual offender.
     Power under the Act to detain a person in jail has
     to be exercised with restraint and great caution."
</p>
<p id="p_14">     In the recent pronouncement of the Supreme Court in the
matter of Pebam Ningol Mikoi Devi v/s. State of Manipur
and others, reported in (2010)9 SCC 618, the Supreme Court
has considered all aspects pertaining to individual liberty and
has also held that in a criminal case, if it is initiated against the
detenu, the prosecution would not be in a position to procure
evidence to sustain conviction cannot be a ground to pass an
order of preventive detention under the <a href="/doc/190229/" id="a_17">National Security Act</a>.
</p>

<p id="p_15">     In the result, this petition succeeds and is hereby
allowed. The order of detention dated 4th September 2014
passed by the respondent authority is hereby ordered to be
quashed and the detenue is ordered to be set at liberty
forthwith if he is not required in any other case. Rule is made
absolute. Direct service is permitted.
