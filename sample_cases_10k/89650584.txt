quarters under construction near Tilak Vihar, managed to flee from the spot 

and sought  help of one chowkidar Vishnu Dev and in the mean time SI 

Gurdev Singh happened to reach there who recovered her in this case and 

also produced for her statement under Sec. 164 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_4">CrPC</a>.  Thereafter <a href="/doc/796352/" id="a_5">Section

he alongwith Ct. Rishi Pal was on patrolling duty and when they reached 

near   vacant  quarters,   Tilak  Vihar,  they  heard  noise.    On reaching  there, 

they found that many persons had gathered there and a girl was in the midst 

of those persons.  That girl told him that she had been brought from Janak 

Puri in a van forcibly.  He took that girl and chowkidar to PP Tilak Vihar 

and  gave the information  to PS Janak Puri.   ASI Sultan Singh  from  PS 

Janak   Puri   came   there   and   he   handed   over   the   girl   to   him   vide   memo

<p id="p_8">8.          PW11 Sh. Praveen Kumar Gupta has stated that he was running a 

shop of electric repair in Posangipur market, Janak puri and about 15­16 

SC No.20A/10                                                                            3/9
 years ago police came to his shop alongwith one person.  That person was 

having a slip Ex.PW11/A which was in his handwriting and the same was

was posted in Special Staff, Dwarka and arrested accused Paramjit who was 

declared proclaimed offender by the Court.  He prepared kalandra and filed 

the same in the Court.  
</p>
<p id="p_11">11.        PW14 Retd SI Sultan Singh has stated that on 19.10.1989 he was 

posted as ASI PS Janak puri.  At about 8.10 PM he received copy of DD 

No.17A   and   reached   P&amp;T   Colony   alongwith   Ct.   Kishan   Pal.     There   he 

recorded  the statement  Ex.PW3/A of Renuka  and made his endorsement 

Ex.PW14/A and got the FIR, copy of which is Ex.PW6/A registered.   He 

prepared the site plan and made enquiries in the locality.  He further stated 

that on receiving the information that the girl had been recovered and was 

present at PP Tilak Vihar, he reached there and found girl 'S' and chowkidar 

Vishnu Dev in PP Tilak Vihar.  He recorded the statement of 'S', SI Gurdev 

Singh,   chowkidar   Vishnu  Dev   and  prepared  recovery   memo   Ex.PW9/A. 

PW14 further stated that he got the girl 'S' medically examined.   On the 

next day they went to P&amp;T Colony where Raj Kumar produced one slip 

Ex.PW11/A   which   was   seized   vide   seizure   memo   Ex.PW13/A.     On 

22.10.1989 he arrested Laddu @ Sanjay Kumar from C­2 bus stand, Janak 

SC No.20A/10                                                                      4/9
 Puri   and   during   interrogation   he   disclosed   the   involvement   of   accused 

Paramjit   alongwith   other   persons.     Accused  Paramjit   surrendered  in   the 

Court  and  he moved  an  application Ex.PW14/X for his TIP but accused 

Paranjit refused to take part in TIP and the proceedings in this regard are 

Ex.PW14/Y.  He has stated that later on accused Paramjit was identified by 

the   victim   in   the   Court   premises   and   he   recorded   her   supplementary 

statement to this effect.  PW14 has further stated that summons of girl 'S' 

were given dasti to him but despite his best efforts she could not be traced 

as her present whereabouts  could not be ascertained.  

</p><p id="p_12">12.         In   his   statement   under   Sec.   313   <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_8">CrPC</a>   accused   Paramjit   has 

denied the case of prosecution and claimed his innocence stating that on the 

day of alleged incident, he was out of station.  
</p>
<p id="p_13">13.         On behalf of State, Sh. S.C. Sharma, Addl. PP has submitted that 

so far as accused Paramjit is concerned, his name appeared in the disclosure 

statement   of   the   co­accused   persons   and   he   surrendered   in   the   Court, 

refused to take part in the TIP and thereafter supplementary statement of 'S' 

was recorded and in these circumstances when the accused Paramjit was 

duly identified by the prosecutrix to be the person who dragged her in the 

Maruti   van,   after  he   was  declared  proclaimed  offender,  her statement  is 

admissible   in   evidence   against   him   and   can   be   treated   as   the   statement 

recorded under Sec. 299 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_9">CrPC</a> as now the witness is not traceable.  It has 

also been submitted that when specific role of accused Paramjit to be the 

person who dragged 'S' in Maruti van has been proved by the prosecution, 

he is the main accused and even in the absence of cross examination of 'S', 

her statement is sufficient to prove the guilt of accused Paramjit specially 

SC No.20A/10                                                                            5/9
 when he was not in the police custody at any point of time and 'S' had no 

chance to see him in the police station.  It is the accused Paramjit who has 

to  explain  in  what  circumstances  he refused to take part  in TIP and his 

refusal in this regard is also sufficient to prove his guilt, hence he is liable 

to be convicted.
</p>
<p id="p_14">14.         On behalf of accused  Paramjit, Sh. Dhian Singh, advocate has 

filed written submissions.   It has been contended that no material witness 

has   been   tendered   for   cross   examination   by   the   prosecution   after   this 

accused has appeared to face trial and the evidence recorded by the Court 

during the time when he was facing trial, the main witness 'S' could not be 

cross   examined.     Her   statement,   being   incomplete,   cannot   be   read   in 

evidence.  It has also been submitted that there are other contradictions also 

on the basis of which statement of prosecutrix become unreliable.  Accused 

Sanjay Sharma and Shashi Bhushan were convicted by the trial Court on 

the basis of admission of convict Rajinder  Singh who admitted before the 

Court that he was driving the Maruti Van at the time of occurrence.   Ld. 

Defence   counsel   has   drawn   the   attention   of   the   Court   to   para   5   of   the 

judgment   wherein   the   statement   of   'S'   recorded   under   sec.164   <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_10">CrPC</a>   is 

referred to in which she stated that the driver caught her hand and forcibly 

dragged her in the car.  However, when she appeared before the Court, she 

made statement to the effect that a white Maruti van came near the park and 

pointing out towards accused Paramjit stated that he came out of the van, 

asked  about  some address  and  when she  expressed  ignorance about  that 

address,   accused   Paramjit   held   her   by   arm   and   dragged   her   inside   the 

Maruti van which is contrary to her version given in statement under Sec. 

</p><p id="p_15">SC No.20A/10                                                                               6/9
 164 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_11">CrPC</a>.  Ld. Defence counsel has also referred to the statement of the co­

accused recorded under Sec. 313 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_12">CrPC</a> wherein in reply to question No.4 

and 5 it has come on record that Rajinder was driving the van and none of 

them stated that the girl 'S' was dragged into the van by accused Paramjit. 

Rather they could  not   say as to who dragged her in the van.  Ld. Defence 

counsel   has   submitted   that  in  these  circumstances  accused  Paramjit  also 

deserves to be acquitted.  
</p>
<p id="p_16">15.         I have carefully considered the rival contentions and also gone 

through the record.  So far as the contention of ld. Addl. PP that statement 

of 'S' be treated as under Sec. 299 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_13">CrPC</a> to base the conviction of accused 

Paramjit is concerned, this contention is liable to be rejected for the reasons 

that accused Paramjit was facing trial at that time and she could not be cross 

examined on the same day.  Subsequently he absconded.  So the statement 

of 'S' so far as this accused is concerned, remained incomplete and her in­

complete statement i.e. without cross examination by this accused, cannot 

be  read   in  evidence  against  him.    Even  if it  is  assumed  for the sake of 

arguments that in­complete statement of 'S' can be read in evidence against 

this accused, even then it is not of much help to the prosecution.  The order 

in   appeal   by   Hon'ble   High   Court   is   on   record  wherein  while   acquitting 

accused   Sanjay   Sharma   and   Shashi   Bhushan,   Hon'ble   High   Court   has 

considered (1) effect of not sending of Ramesh to face trial as he was the 

person known to 'S' and named in the statement under sec. 164 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_14">CrPC</a> as one 

of the kidnapper but he was not arrested; (2) PW12 Sh.Raj Kumar, brother 

of 'S' saw accused Sanjay sitting in the van on the day of incident but was 

named on 22.10.1989 after unduly long delay; (3) Manoj Kumar who took 

SC No.20A/10                                                                         7/9
 part in TIP could not be identified by the complainant as one of the culprit, 

hence discharged; (4) accused Sanjay Sharma and Shashi Bhushan refused 

to take part in TIP and from the statement of 'S' and her brother Raj Kumar 

(PW12) it was established on record that they had seen them in the PS and 

contrary to the case of prosecution that accused Sanjay Sharma was arrested 

in presence of 'S' and her brother Raj Kumar (PW12), they were claimed to 

be seen only in the PS and not arrested in their presence or at their instance; 

(5) the statement of convict Rajinder Singh also could not be read against 

the   co­accused   as   confession.     Hon'ble   High   Court   disbelieving   the 

testimony   of   PW2   'S'   as   well   as   her   brother   Sh.   Raj   Kumar   (PW12) 

acquitted accused Sanjay Sharma and Shashi Bhushan.  Now on the basis of 

the same evidence, with the contradictions that have already emerged on 

record, prosecution cannot claim that their testimony can be believed by the 

Court  to convict accused Paramjit for the offence complained of.

</p><p id="p_17">16.        This Court cannot ignor that the person Ramesh, named to be the 

kidnapper, known to 'S' was not arrested, further Manoj was got discharged 

because he preferred to take part in TIP but remained unidentified.  After 

appearance of accused Paramjit in the instant case, the kidnapped girl 'S' 

remained   untraceable   and   her   in­complete   testimony   cannot   be   read   in 

evidence against him and even if the contention of ld. Addl. PP is accepted 

for the sake of arguments, the version given by her that accused Paramjit 

dragged her in the van, is in total contradiction to the version given by her 

under Sec. 164 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_15">CrPC</a> wherein she named the driver to be the person who 

dragged her and driver of the van admittedly was convict Rajinder Singh 

and not accused Paramjit.  No doubt, accused Paramjit had surrendered in 

SC No.20A/10                                                                        8/9
 the Court and the police had no chance to show him to the witnesses but his 

identity is otherwise not well established for the reason that as per initial 

version   given   by   'S'   in   her   statement   under   Sec.   164   <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_16">CrPC</a>,   the   driver 

dragged her in the van.   However, when she pointed out towards accused 

Paramjit, the role attributed by her to him was that he came down from the 

van to enquire about some address and when she claimed ignorance, it was 

he who dragged her inside the vanIt cannot be ignored by the Court that in 

the complaint Ex.PW3/A the complainant has no where stated that anybody 

got down from the van and dragged her niece 'S' in the van.  Omission of 

this fact further makes the statement of 'S' doubtful regarding getting down 

of accused Paramjit from the van and dragging her in.

</p><p id="p_18">17.         In   view   of   the   above   discussion,   I   am   of   the   opinion   that 

prosecution  has not been able to prove its case against  accused Paramjit 

beyond reasonable doubt, hence he is acquitted.  Since the accused is in J/C, 

he be released forthwith if not required in any other case.  File be consigned 

to record room.  </p><pre id="pre_2">
