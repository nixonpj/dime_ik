2/02.03.2017</pre><p id="p_1">     Heard Mr. Kaushik Sarkhel, learned counsel for the petitioner
           and Mr. Sudhansu Kumar Deo, learned A.P.P. for the State.
</p><p id="p_2">                 This application is directed against the order dated 07.02.2017
           passed by the learned Additional Sessions Judge Ist, Jamtara in
           Criminal Appeal No. 5 of 2017 whereby and whereunder the appeal
           preferred by the petitioner against the order dated 07.01.2017 passed
           by the learned Principal Magistrate, Juvenile Justice Board, Jamtara in
           connection with Mihijam P. S. Case No. 119 of 2016 rejecting the
           prayer for bail of the petitioner has been affirmed.
</p><p id="p_3">                 It has been stated that the petitioner has been implicated on the
           allegation that on false pretext of marriage, he has established physical
           relationship with the informant. He further submitted that the petitioner
           is in observation home since 22.11.2016. He submits that the Social
           Investigation Report justifies the cause of the petitioner as it has been
           mentioned therein that the petitioner does not have any inclination to
           commit any crime and the father of the petitioner is ready to give
           undertaking that he shall keep the petitioner away from the anti social
           elements.
</p><p id="p_4">                 Learned A.P.P. for the State opposing the prayer has referred to
           the statement recorded under <a href="/doc/497457/" id="a_1">Section 164</a> of Cr.P.C. in which it has
           been stated that on the pretext of marriage, the petitioner has
           established physical relationship with the informant.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                              -2-</span>
<p id="p_5">                        The Social Investigation Report is not adverse to the cause of
                  the petitioner in view of the fact that the petitioner does not have any
                  criminal antecedent and there appears to be no inclination of the
                  petitioner to commit crime. The allegation seems to be of establishing
                  physical relationship with the victim on the pretext of marriage. The
                  petitioner is in observation home since 22.11.2016. Such facts having
                  not been properly appreciated by the learned trial court as well as by
                  the learned appellate court, this application is allowed and the
                  impugned orders dated 07.01.2017 and 07.02.2017 are quashed and
                  set aside.
</p><p id="p_6">                        The petitioner above named is directed to be released on bail on
                  furnishing bail bond of Rs. 10,000/- (Ten Thousand) with two sureties
                  of the like amount each, to the satisfaction of the Principal Magistrate,
                  Juvenile Justice Board, Jamtara in connection with Mihijam P. S. Case
                  No. 119 of 2016 corresponding to G. R. No. 982 of 2016 on a condition
                  that, the father of the petitioner will keep the petitioner at a safe place
                  and will not allow him to meet any bad element and further directed to
                  produce the petitioner before Juvenile Justice Board, Jamtara on each
                  and every date fixed in the concerned case, till the conclusion of the
                  inquiry.
</p><p id="p_7">                        Let this order be communicated through FAX to the concerned
                  court at the cost of the petitioner.
