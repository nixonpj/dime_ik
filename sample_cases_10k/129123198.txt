DATED: 28.08.2017  

CORAM   

THE HONOURABLE MR.JUSTICE R.MAHADEVAN             

W.P(MD)No.16072 of 2017   

M.Mohamed Mansoor Hallaj        
rep. by his own  brother and power of attorney
M.Mohamed Iqbal                                 ..  Petitioner      
Vs.

The Inspector General of Registration,
Registration Department,
Office of the Registration Department,
No.100, Santhom High-way,  
Pattinapakkam, Chennai.                         ..  Respondent        

PRAYER: Writ Petition is filed under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India
praying for the issuance of a Writ of Mandamus directing the respondent to
conduct detail enquiry and to take necessary action in accordance with law on
the basis of the petitioner's brother's representation dated 23.06.2017
within the time stipulated by this Court.

!For Petitioner                 : Mr.I.Sabeer Mohamed  

For Respondent          : Mr.C.Selvaraj,
                                  Special Government Pleader.
        
:ORDER  
</pre><p id="p_1">        This writ petition is filed seeking a writ of Mandamus to direct the
respondent to conduct detailed enquiry and to take necessary action in
accordance with law on the basis of the petitioner's brother's representation
dated 23.06.2017, within the time stipulated by this Court.
</p>
<p id="p_2">        2.Mr.C.Selvaraj, learned Special Government Pleader, takes notice for
the respondent.  By consent of both the parties, this writ petition is taken
up for hearing at the stage of admission itself.
</p>
<p id="p_3">        3.Heard both sides.
</p>
<p id="p_4">        4.The case of the petitioner is that the petitioner purchased a land in
Survey Nos.350/1B [Joint Patta No.969], 360/2 [Joint Patta       No.968] and
455 [Joint Patta No.970] at Valuthur Village, Papanasam Taluk, Thanjavur
District and all the revenue records transferred into joint patta No.533 in
his name and others and he is in possession and enjoyment of the same. 
According to the petitioner, so as to grab the properties mentioned in joint
patta No.533, one Mohamed Masthan and his brother Abdul Hakkim, without   
having any rights, except cutting of betel leaves, fraudulently created many
documents and sold some survey numbers to some other persons as per Document     
Nos.942 and 966 of 1976, with the help of the office bearers of Ayyampettai
and Papanasam Sub Registrar Offices.  On representation to the Sub-Registrar,
Ayyampettai, he passed an order dated 12.01.2016, stating that the said
documents are related to the right of cutting of betel leaves.  The
petitioner also preferred a representation to the District Collector and Sub
Collector of Thanjavur District and on the basis of the same, the Sub
Collector conducted a detailed enquiry and removed the names of the above
said persons from joint patta Nos.968 and 969 and also include the
petitioner's name in the joint patta.  The grievance of the petitioner is
that on the basis of document Nos.942/1976, 966/1976 and patta No.533, the
said persons illegally registered some documents before the said Sub
Registrar Offices.  Therefore, he made a representation dated 23.06.2017 to
the respondent, seeking to cancel all the documents, which were illegally
registered on the basis of parental document No.942/1976 and the same has not
been considered so far.  Therefore, the petitioner is before this Court.
</p>
<p id="p_5">        5.Though the prayer in the writ petition is at large, the learned
counsel appearing for the petitioner confines his prayer only to direct that
the representation dated 23.06.2017 be considered by the respondent, for
which, the learned Special Government Pleader appearing for the respondent,
has no serious objection.
</p>
<p id="p_6">        6.Considering the limited scope of the relief sought for, this Court,
without going into the merits of the petitioner's claim, directs the
respondent to consider the representation of the petitioner dated 23.06.2017,
and pass appropriate orders on its own merit and in accordance with law,
after affording due opportunity of hearing to the petitioner, within a period
of six weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of this order.  If any third
party will be affected by the nature of the relief
sought for by the petitioner or by any order to be passed, the authority
shall hear such person to avoid the allegations of violation of principles of
natural justice.
</p>
<p id="p_7">        7.The writ petition is disposed of as above. No costs.
</p>                                                                        

<p id="p_8">To

The Inspector General of Registration,
Registration Department,
Office of the Registration Department,
No.100, Santhom High-way,  
Pattinapakkam, Chennai.
