                  action against the fifth respondent for illegally transmitting analogue signal
                  in violation of Section 4A Cable TV Network Regulation Act and seize the
                  equipments used by the fifth respondent for transmission of Analogue signal

</p><p id="p_3">                          2. To be noted, respondent No.5 is a private respondent. In the

                  hearing, learned counsel for writ petitioner restricts the prayer to disposal of

                  representation. From the abridged prayer it comes to light that an order,

                  which is not adverse to respondent No.5 (private respondent) can be

                  passed, after making sufficient and adequate safe-guards in this regard.

                  Advocate, on behalf of respondents 2 to 4 (official respondents), main writ

                  petition is taken up, heard out and is being disposed of.



</p><p id="p_5">                          4. The main writ petition turns on a very narrow compass, as it is one

                  seeking mandamus qua disposal of writ petitioner's representation dated

                  12.07.2019 wherein writ petitioner has inter alia complained that fifth

                  respondent is transmitting analogue signal .

                  support of the writ petition, notwithstanding several grounds raised /

                  contentions urged in the affidavit filed in support of instant writ petition,

                  learned counsel for writ petitioner (as mentioned supra) abridges the scope

                  of the writ petition and submits that it will suffice if the second respondent

                  is directed to dispose of the aforementioned representation of the writ

                  petitioner, dated 12.07.2019, details of which have been alluded to supra.

                  12.07.2019 made by the writ petitioner (page Nos.8 to 10 of the typed set

                  weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of this order.



</p><p id="p_10">                          8. It is made clear that in the course of the representation being

                  considered by the second respondent, if the rights of any other third party /

                  parties or any other third party entity / entities is / are likely to be affected,

                  the second respondent shall put on notice and give reasonable opportunity

                  to such third party / parties or any other third party entity / entities, before

                  disposing of the aforementioned writ petitioner's representation. Though

                  obvious, it is made clear that this Court has not expressed any opinion or

                  view on the merits of the matter. It is also made clear with specificity that

                  respondent No.5 has to be put on notice and given a reasonable opportunity

                  in the writ petition. In other words, all contentions raised in the writ petition
