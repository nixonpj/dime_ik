</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">                    "The compromise, in a modern society, is the sine qua non of
             harmony and orderly behaviour. It is the soul of justice and if the power
             under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_7">Section 482</a> of the Criminal Procedure Code is used to enhance
             such a compromise which, in turn, enhances the social amity and
             reduces friction, then it truly is "finest hour of justice".</blockquote><p id="p_10">
</p><p id="p_11">             The Hon'ble Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/469138/" id="a_8">B.S.Joshi and others v. State of

Haryana</a>, 2003(4) SCC 675 has observed that it becomes the duty of the Court

to encourage genuine settlements of matrimonial disputes.

</p><p id="p_12">             In view of the above, it would be in the interest of justice to quash

the abovesaid FIR as no useful purpose would be served by continuance of the

present proceedings. It will only lead to wastage of precious time of the court

and would be an exercise in futility.

<p id="p_13">             This petition is, thus, allowed and FIR No. 351 dated 12.12.2014

registered under <a href="/doc/538436/" id="a_9">Sections 498-A</a>,<a href="/doc/1011035/" id="a_10">323</a>,<a href="/doc/988620/" id="a_11">406</a> and <a href="/doc/180217/" id="a_12">506</a> of the IPC at Police Station

Nangal Chaudhary, District Mahendergarh alongwith all consequential

proceedings arising therefrom are hereby quashed qua the petitioner. Liberty

is, however, afforded to respondent No. 2 to file necessary application for revival

of the proceedings in the above said FIR, in case the terms and conditions of

settlement between the parties are not adhered to by the petitioner or it is found

that the settlement was a mere ruse to have the aforesaid FIR quashed.</p><pre id="pre_2">
