         laid down by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of

         reported in (2005) 8 SCC 89, no specific averments

         admittedly incharge of all the affairs of the

         Company for the conduct of its business. He further

         submitted that Form No. 32 filed before the

         therefore, no averments were required to be made

         in the complaint in respect of their vicarious liability

         towards the Company. That, so far as the accused

         no.2 is concerned, two different documents are

         produced on record and in Form no. 32, accused

         no.2 is shown as a Managing Director w.e.f. 20th

         August, 2012 as a Managing Director, working with

         the Company-accused no.1, no specific averments

         of his liability are required as he is deemed to be a

         liable for the affairs of the Company. He is further

         liable    under          <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_6">Section      141</a>         of       the        Negotiable

         therefore, the order passed by this Court would not

         be binding to the complainant. That, accused no.3 is

         vicariously liable for the affairs of the Company, as

         at the relevant point of time, he was under

         knowledge            that    rent       was            not         paid         to       the

         complainant. That, resignation of the accused no.3

         would not exonerate him from criminal liability.

         That, discretionary jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_7">Section 482</a>

         CrPC may not be exercised in favour of the

         applicants. Ultimately, it was requested by him to

         charge of, or was responsible in a day-to-day affairs

         of the Company at the time of commission of

         alleged offence. There is not even a whisper or

         shared of evidence on record to show that there is

         any act committed by the appellant, from which, a

         reasonable interference can be drawn that the

         appellant could be vicariously held liable for the

         offence, with which, she is charged. Under the

         circumstances, complaint was quashed by Hon'ble

         issued summons to                 all        the accused persons,

         including appellant therein. The appellant had

         complainant. It was held that dishonoured cheques

         were issued by the Company on 30.04.2004 ie.,

         much after appellant resigned from the post of

         Director of the Company. Acceptance of appellant's

         resignation gets duly reflected in the resolution

         dated 02.03.2004. It was not even the case of

         complainants that dishonoured cheques were issued

         by the appellant. On the date when the alleged

         offence was committed by the Company, the

         appellant was not the Director; he had nothing to do

         manner, the accused no.3 was in charge of, and

         what was responsible to the accused-Company for

         Directors. The question was whether the complaint

         was maintainable against Director of the Company,

         who has resigned and whether the Director, who

         has      resigned,            can       be          prosecuted               after          his

         resignation, has been accepted by the Board of

         Directors of the Company. The High Court was

         pleased         to         quash     the        complaint               against            the

         Directors on the ground that there were bald

         allegations against the Directors that they were

         looking after business of the Company etc., Hon'ble

         Supreme Court held that complaint cannot be

         quashed on the ground that apart from basic

         averments, no particulars are given.

</p><p id="p_27">         15.            It appears from the record that two

         identical         complaints     were           also         filed        by        the

         respondent no.2 against the present applicants in

         respect of two different cheques and both the

         complaints were challenged by the applicants

         before this Court by filing two different quashing

         petitions, being Criminal Misc. Application No.

         6151of 2011 and            Criminal Misc. Application No.

         6152 of 2011. It also appears that both the petitions

         were quashed by a common oral judgment dated

         26th August, 2011. Copy of the common oral

         judgment passed by this Court in Criminal Misc.

         Application No. 6151of 2011 and                              Criminal Misc.

         Application No. 6152 of 2011 is produced on record.

         Learned advocate Mr. MD Thakkar appearing on

         behalf of the respondent no.2 has admitted that

         quashment of the aforesaid two petitions and the

         order passed in both these petitions are not

         challenged.

</p><p id="p_29">         16.            From the complaint, it appears that no

         ingredients of offence punishable under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_19">Section 138</a>

         of the Negotiable Instruments Act are made out

         against        the         present      applicants.                None           of      the

         applicants have signed any cheque in question and

         both of them have resigned as Directors of the

         Company on 20th August, 2010, while the cheque in

         question were deposited and dishonoured on 25th

         November, 2010. Notice under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_20">Section 138</a> of the NI

         Act was issued on 23rd December, 2010 ie., after

         resignation of the applicants. No allegations are

         made in the complaint in respect of the role

         attributed by the present applicants. Under <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_21">Section

         141</a> of the NI Act, it is necessary to specifically aver

         in the complaint that at the time of alleged offence,

         the accused person was in charge of, and/or

         responsible for the conduct of the business of the

         Company. This averment is an essential ingredient

         for arraigning the accused under <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_22">Section 141</a>.

         Without this averment being made in the complaint,

         requirements of <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_23">Section 141</a> cannot be said to be

         satisfied. Merely being a Director of a Company, as

         alleged in the impugned complaint, would not be

         sufficient to make any person liable under <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_24">Section

         141</a> of the NI Act. A Director in a Company cannot

         be held to be in charge of and/or responsible to the

         Company             for    conduct        of       its      business.               The

         requirement of <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_25">Section 141</a> is that the person

         sought to be responsible for the conduct of the

         business of the Company at the relevant time. This

         has to be averred as a fact, as there is no deemed

         liability of a Director in such cases. The respondent

         no.2 being Managing Director would admittedly be

         in-charge of the Company and responsible for the

         conduct of its business.
