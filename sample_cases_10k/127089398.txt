             (BY SRI.V.R.DATAR, ADVOCATE)

    THIS WRIT PETITION IS FILED UNDER ARTICLES 226
AND 227 OF THE CONSTITUTION OF INDIA PRAYING TO
                                    :2:



CALL FOR THE RECORDS PERTAINING TO THE
PROCEEDINGS OF I.A.NO.VI IN O.S.NO.6/2006 IN RESPECT
OF THE ORDER PASSED ON I.A.NO.VI IN O.S.NO.6/2006,
DATED 17/7/09 PRODUCED AT ANN-A AND ETC.,

     THIS PETITION COMING ON FOR FINAL HEARING
THIS DAY, THE COURT, MADE THE FOLLOWING:

                             ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">        The petitioner has filed this writ petition challenging the

order passed by the trial Court allowing the application for

impleadment filed by the respondent herein-N.K. Shashidhar.


</p><p id="p_2">2.      The plaintiff has filed a suit for declaration that he has a

right to mine and quarry in the scheduled land and it is saved

under the provisions of Section 9 of the Bombay Personal

Inams Abolition Act, due to the terms of the Sanad of 1832

granted to the original Inamdar.
</p>
<p id="p_3">
</p><p id="p_4">3.      The property in respect of which he is seeking the said

declaration is Sy.No.296/1B/1 (old No.296/1A/1) situated at

Balkundi village, Hungunda Taluk, Bijapur District. In fact,

it is   part of Sy.No.296 measuring 290 acres, whereas the

plaintiff is claiming only 5 acres. The plaintiff has produced
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                      :3:</span>



sketch of the property in respect of which he is seeking

declaration.   Apart from plaintiffs, others were also granted

land in Sy.No.296. The said grant has been cancelled by the

Government by its order dated 05.08.1995. In the suit, the

plaintiff is seeking declaration that the said Government

Order is null and void.      The respondent who has filed the

impleading application to come on record in the said suit was

also aggrieved by the aforesaid Government Order, where the

earlier grant has been cancelled.           This Court on a writ

petition filed by the plaintiff, respondent and some of the

persons, who are similarly placed, had directed them to

approach the Civil Court seeking declaration. It is thereafter

the   petitioner   has   filed   a   suit   in   O.S.No.33/97   and

respondent also has filed a suit in O.S.No.148/97.              The

respondent is claiming 4 acres of land in Sy.No.296/1B/2.

Obviously, having regard to the survey numbers, it is the

adjoining property. But unfortunately in the schedule given

to the plaint, on three sides of Sy.No.296/1B/1 the very same

survey number is given. In the sketch produced there is no
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                 :4:</span>



mention about Sy.No.296/1B/2. It is in these circumstances,

as it is a dispute regarding boundary and there is also a

possibility of overlapping, the respondent wanted to implead

himself in the suit so that the rights of the parties could be

determined. The said application was opposed. The learned

trial Judge has allowed the said application on the ground

that the petitioner herein has filed an application in

O.S.No.148/97 and the same is allowed.           The learned

Counsel for the petitioner pointed out by producing copy of

the said application that the petitioner has not filed any such

application. Therefore there is an error occurred on the face

of the record.   That by itself would not be sufficient to set

aside the order passed by the trial Court.
</p>
<p id="p_5">
</p><p id="p_6">4.   The petitioner and the respondent are claiming rights in

two different portions of Sy.No.296.    Having regard to the

numbers allotted to them, may be they are adjoining to each

other. Therefore both of them filed a suit which is pending in

the same Court. Therefore in the presence of these persons,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                   :5:</span>



rights of each one of them is to be decided so that in future,

there would not be any controversy.         In that view of the

matter, though not for the reasons given by the trial Court,

but for the aforesaid reasons, it is necessary that the

respondent is a necessary party to the suit for declaration of

title and for injunction. In that view of the matter, I do not

see any justification to interfere with the order passed by the

trial Court. Hence, I pass the following order:


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">            Writ petition is dismissed. It is open to the

       petitioner herein to implead himself in the suit

       filed by the respondent, if he so desires.

</p><p id="p_8">                                               JUDGE
