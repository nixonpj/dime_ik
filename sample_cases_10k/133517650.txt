IN THE COURT OF SH. KAMLESH KUMAR; AD&amp;SJ(CENTRAL)-17,DELHI

Suit No. 256/03

M/s Aman Consultants                                                .......Plaintiff

                               Versus

M/s A.R. Enterprises and Anr.                                 .......Defendants


ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">           This order will dispose of an application under Section

151 CPC filed on behalf of the Defendants, in the suit for recovery

of Rs.3,66,749/- filed by the Plaintiff against them.



</p><p id="p_2">2)      The Applicants / Defendants have stated that Shri Arun

Kumar Goel, one of the directors of the Plaintiff company had filed

another suit against them, which has been dismissed by Dr. (Ms)

Kamini Lau, ld. ADJ, Delhi vide her judgment dated 11.02.2008.

The Applicants have, further, stated that in their written statement

to the present suit, they have submitted that no amount was due

and payable to the Plaintiff since the alleged amounts claimed by

the Plaintiff were merely book entries. The Applicants have further

stated that it has been held by Dr. (Ms) Kamini Lau, ld. ADJ. Delhi

in the other Civil Suit that the cheques were given by the

Defendants for the purpose of entry transaction in favour of the

Plaintiff. The Applicants have, further, stated that in view of the

findings of the ld. ADJ Delhi in the said suit, the present suit is

barred by the principle of resjudicata. It is, further, stated that Sh

Arun Kumar Goel, the Plaintiff in the said case has preferred

Regular    First   Appeal   (RFA)   against        the      Judgment            dated

11.02.2008. It is prayed that the proceedings in the present case be

stayed till the disposal of appeal (RFA) is decided by the Hon'ble

High Court.
</p>
<p id="p_5">

</p><p id="p_6">3)        The application has been contested on behalf of the

Plaintiff. In reply to the application, the Plaintiff has alleged that

the present application has been filed with malafide intention to

drag the litigation. The Plaintiff has claimed that the present suit

was filed in the year 2003 whereas the other suit was filed on

20.04.2004. The Plaintiff has also claimed that it has a separate

distinct legal entity and Sh Arun Kumar Goel had filed the said suit

(decided by the court of Dr.(Ms) Kamini Lau), in his individual

capacity. The Plaintiff has submitted that the subject matter of the

two suits is also not identical and that the findings of the other court

are neither binding on this court nor the principle of resjudicata

applies. It is prayed that the application be dismissed.

</p><p id="p_9">4)      I heard the ld. counsel for the parties at bar and have

carefully perused the record.
</p>
<p id="p_10">

</p><p id="p_11">5)      The instant suit has been filed by the Plaintiff company for

recovery of Rs.3,66,749/- whereas Sh Arun Kumar Goel, one of the

directors of the Plaintiff company filed the other suit in his individual

capacity for recovery of Rs.4,33,500/-. I also observe that the

cause of action in the two suits is also different. The parties are also

different. The subject matter of the suits is also different. Moreover,

the findings of the court of ld. ADJ Dr. (Ms) Kamini Lau has no

effect whatsoever on the trial of the present suit. The application

clearly has no merits and is liable to be dismissed. I order

accordingly.
