:JUDGMENT   
</pre>
<p id="p_1">                This Civil Miscellaneous Appeal has been filed against the order
dated 30.09.2010,  passed in W.C.No.59 of 2007, on the file of the
Commissioner for Workmen's  Compensation  (Deputy Commissioner of Labour),    
Thirunelveli.
</p>
<p id="p_2">                2. The appellant / Insurance Company is the second respondent in
W.C.No.59 of 2007, on the file of the Commissioner for Workmen's
Compensation,  Thirunelveli.  The respondents 1 to 6 filed the above said
claim petition against the 7th respondent and appellant.   According to the
respondents  1 to 6, the husband of the first respondent,  father of the
respondents 2 to 6 was working as a driver of the 7th respondent and died
during and in the course of his employment under 7th respondent.  The
appellant is the insurer of the vehicle.  Hence, they filed the claim
petition claiming a sum of Rs.10,00,000/- as compensation, for the death of
one  Jeganathan. 
</p>
<p id="p_3">                3. The 7th respondent remained ex parte before the Tribunal.
</p>
<p id="p_4">                4. The appellant resisted the claim on the ground that the
deceased was son of the 7th respondent and was not an employee of the 7th 
respondent and at the time of accident, the deceased was not having valid
driving licence.  The Commissioner for Workmen's Compensation (Deputy  
Commissioner of Labour), Thirunelveli, considering the pleadings, oral and
documentary evidence,  held that there is no prohibition for the son to work
under father and held that the accident occurred during and in the course of
employment and the appellant, who is insurer of the vehicle is liable to pay
compensation to the respondents 1 to 6.  By applying formula, the
Commissioner for Workmen's Compensation (Deputy Commissioner of Labour),    
Thirunelveli, awarded a sum of Rs.1,75,440/- as compensation.
</p>
<p id="p_5">                5. Against the said order, the appellant / Insurance Company has
filed the present appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_6">                6. The learned counsel appearing for the appellant relied on the
following Judgments and reiterated the averments made in the counter as well
as the grounds in the appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_7">                (i) 2008(2) TN MAC 572 (National Insurance Company Limited Vs. 
Nagaraj and others), wherein at paragraphs 13 and 14, it has been held as
follows:
</p>
<p id="p_8">                ? 13. To Sum-up, the first respondent took his wife and daughters
and his other family members and friend to Rameswaram as personal trip of
pilgrimage and on return he met with an accident.  It could not be stated
that the accident took place in the course of the employment, nor he was an
employee under the second respondent.   It is to be observed that there is no
evidence to show that the responden is an employee under the second 
respondent.  Ignoring the material facts available in this case, the Workmen
Compensation Commissioner has mechanically passed the order by observing that   
the relationship between the appellant and first respondent is the employee
of the second respondent.  The said finding is not at all sustainable.
</p>
<p id="p_9">                14. In view of the above said discussion, the first respondent
could not get the workmen compensation.   The observations and findings of
the workmen's compensation Commission, need interference of this Court which 
have to be reversed.  The impugned order suffers from infirmity, which is
liable to be set aside and accordingly, the same is set aside.?
</p>

<p id="p_10">        (ii) 2007(1) TN MAC 460 (SC) (Gottumukkala Narasimha Raju and others  
Vs. National Insurance Company Limited), wherein  at paragraphs 24 to 26, it
has been held as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_11">        ? 24. In our considered opinion, it is wholly absurd to suggest that
the husband would be a ?Workman?of his wife in absence of any specific
contract.   We have no doubt in our mind that for the purpose of proceeding
under the 1923 Act, only the appellants have concocted the story of husband
and wife living separately in view of certain disputes, the question of
husband being a ?workman?under her appears to be a far ? fetched one. 
</p>
<p id="p_12">        25.Technically, it may be possible that the  husband is employed under
the wife, but, while arriving at a conclusion that when a dispute has been
raised by other side, the overall situation should have been taken into
consideration.  The fact, which speaks for itself shows that the owner of the
Tractor joined hands with the claimant for lying a claim only against the
insurer.  The claim was not bonafide.
</p>
<p id="p_13">                26. No documentary proof to establish the contract of employment
was produced.  No independent witness was examined.  Even as to for what 
purpose the tractor was being used had not been disclosed.  How the accident
had taken place is also know borne out form the records of the case.  If the
deceased, with all intent and purport, was the owner of the tr actor, the
Claim Petition under the 1988 Act might not have been maintainable.  A
petition under 1923 Act  certainly would not lie.  Only because <a href="/doc/1113485/" id="a_3">Sections 143</a>
and <a href="/doc/1113485/" id="a_4">167</a> of the 1988 Act, thte same by itself would not mean that the
provisions of the 1988 Act.  The Limited applicability of the provisions of
the 1988 Act, in relation to the proceedings under the 1923 Act has been
discussed by this Court in the aforementioned judgment.   It is, thus, not
possible to extend the scope and ambit of the provisions of 1988 Act to the
provisions of 1923 Act and and except to the extent noticed hereinbefore.?
</p>

<p id="p_14">        (iii) 1974 ACJ 491 (Thilagavathy and others Vs. Sundaram and another),
wherein at paragraph 6, it has been held as follows:
</p>

<p id="p_15">        6. .... Before making the insurer liable, it is necessary for the
claimants to prove that the insured has become legally liable to pay any
compensation in   respect of the deceased.  The insured would be legally
liable if the deceased had  been his employee.   He may also be legally
liable if the deceased has committed a tortious act against the third
parties. But, in this case, we have found that the deceased was not the
employee of   the insured.   The case of the claimants themselves is that the
deceased was not guilty of rashness and negligence and did not commit any 
tortious act.  It would, therefore, follow that no foundation has been laid
for the vicarious liability of the insured.?
</p>
<p id="p_16">                7. The contention of the learned counsel appearing for the
appellant is  that the deceased being the son of the 7th respondent / owner
of the Tractor and was not working as a driver and that the deceased did not
possess valid driving licence.  The contention of the learned counsel
appearing for the appellant that a son cannot be employed by father is
without merits.   There is no prohibition for a  son or relative to work
under his father or relative. Both the above contentions were considered by
the the Commissioner for Workmen's Compensation (Deputy Commissioner of    
Labour), Thirunelveli and were rejected.  The Judgments relied on by the
learned counsel appearing for the appellant do not advance the case of the
appellant. The reasoning of the Commissioner that there is no prohibition for
the son to work under his father and the same is generally prevalent  in the
Village and that there is no reason to interfere with the said reason.
</p>
<p id="p_17">                8. As far as the driving licence is concerned, the appellant has
examined Officials from the RTO as RW.1 and its employee as RW.2. The   
appellant has not proved that the deceased did not possess driving licence at
the time of accident.  RW.1 has deposed that the person can obtain a driving
licence from any other RTO by producing proof of residence and that in the
said Road Transport Office documents were computerised only in the year 2007.
Since the deceased died in the year 2006, they cannot say about the driving
licence of the deceased.
</p>
<p id="p_18">                9. The  Commissioner for Workmen's Compensation (Deputy   
Commissioner of Labour), Thirunelveli,  considering the evidence of RW.1 and
RW.2 held that the appellant failed to prove that the deceased did not
possess driving licence at the time of accident. Further, he has observed
that even if the deceased did not possess driving licence, the appellant is
liable to pay compensation at the first instance.       The Commissioner
directed the appellant, to deposit the amount, but, did not order to recover
the same from the 7th respondent.  The Commissioner for Workmen's  
Compensation (Deputy Commissioner of Labour), Thirunelveli, has held that the
appellant failed to prove that the deceased did not possess driving licence
at the time of accident and therefore, the question of pay and recovery does
not arise.
</p>
<p id="p_19">                10. In the result, this Civil Miscellaneous Appeal is dismissed,
by  confirming the order dated 30.09.2010,  passed in W.C.No.59 of 2007, on
the file of the Commissioner for Workmen's Compensation (Deputy Commissioner   
of Labour), Thirunelveli. No costs.  Consequently, connected Miscellaneous
Petition is closed.     
</p>
<p id="p_20">                11.  The appellant  / Insurance Company is directed to deposit
the amount awarded by the   Commissioner for Workmen's Compensation (Deputy    
Commissioner of Labour), Thirunelveli to credit of W.C.No.59 of 2007,  after
deducting the amount already deposited if any, within a period of eight weeks
from the date of receipt of a copy of this Judgment. The respondents 1 to 6 /
claimants are entitled to their share as per the apportionment fixed by the
Tribunal.  On such deposit being made, the respondents 1 to 4  / claimants
are permitted to withdraw their  share on  filing necessary application.  The
share of the minor respondents 5 and 6 shall  be deposited in any one of the
Nationalized Banks till they attain majority.  The mother of the minor
respondents 5 and 6 / first respondent is permitted to withdraw the interest
of minors once in three months directly from the Bank.
