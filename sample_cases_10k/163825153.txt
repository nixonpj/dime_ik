<p id="p_1">­:    J U D G M E N T:­


</p><p id="p_2">1. This is  an appeal against   the impugned judgment and decree dated

   3.12.2009   passed   by   Shri   Gorakh   Nath   Pandey   ld.JSCC/ACJ   (North
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                          2</span>

  East), Karkardooma Courts, Delhi, whereby the suit of the plaintiff for

  declaration has been decreed.
</p>
<p id="p_3">2. Briefly stating, the plaintiff has filed the suit for  declaration that marriage

  between the parties has been dissolved by virtue of talaknama dated

  23.04.2008,   as   per   the   provision   of   Muslim   law   and   also   sought

  injunction against  the defendant,  restraining  her from interfering in  the

  personal  life and liberty of the plaintiff, on the averments that the plaintiff

  is a peace  loving and law abiding citizen. His marriage was solemnized

  on 10.4.2006 with the defendant in accordance   with Muslim   rites and

  customs, in presence of parents, relatives and friends of both the parties

  at Delhi. The Nikah was simple and no dowry was given and received  in

  the  Nikah. The (Dowry) amount of Mehar of Rs. 10,000/­ was excused

  by the defendant, on the first night.
</p>
<p id="p_4">3. He has further  stated that the  Nikah  was duly consummated and out of

  the wedlock, one female  child  Shirin  was  born on dated 3.10.2007.

</p><p id="p_5">4. He has further stated that   he has never given a single chance   to the

  defendant of any complaint, but, the defendant has neither given any

  respect   to the plaintiff nor she  discharged   her moral duties towards

  him. He has alleged that the defendant has misbehaved with him and left

  his company,  without any sufficient cause  on dated 12.3.2008.

</p><p id="p_6">5. He has further stated that he had made efforts to settle the matter  and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                               3</span>

  requested the defendant to return  to her matrimonial home, for the sake

  of the female child, but the defendant  flatly refused  to accompany  him

  and threatened  him to implicate  him in a false case.

</p><p id="p_7">6. The plaintiff further stated  that on 20.4.2008, he had pronounced  Talak

  to the defendant   by saying that ''Maine Afroz Ko Talak Diya,   Maine

  Afroz Ko Talak Diya, Maine Afroz Ko Talak Diya'' in the presence of two

  persons/witnesses in accordance  with the Muslim law and thereafter on

  23.4.2008 he has sent a Talaknama to the defendant through registered

  post/AD, but  the same  was received  back  unserved and on the same

  day   the   plaintiff   has   also   sent   a   money   order     of   Rs.   4000/­   to   the

  defendant for  the  period   of  IDDAT,  which  was   also  received      back

  unserved.
</p>
<p id="p_8">7. The plaintiff has  further  stated that  on dated 6.5.2008, the plaintiff has

  published   the same   in the daily newspaper Rashtriya Sahara and all

  the religious  formalities regarding  the said Talk  have been fulfilled.

</p><p id="p_9">8.   He has also stated that on   dated 12.8.2008 at about 9.00 p.m., the

  defendant entered  in his house forcibly and tried to compromise with the

  plaintiff, as the defendant  was willing the reunion of the parties, but as

  the marital relations between  the parties  have come to an end,  so, no

  hope   and chance   for reunion   are left. Nor the religion of the parties

  allow them   to do so, as the plaintiff has already given Talak   to the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                           4</span>

  defendant , in presence of two  witness by pronouncing three times that

  ''Maine Afroz Ko Talak Diya, Maine Afroz Ko Talak Diya, Maine Afroz Ko

  Talak Diya'' and thus,  as per the SHARIYAT Law  the TALAK  given by

  the plaintiff   to the defendant   has become   irrevocable   and final     he

  has also stated that the relationship  of the plaintiff and  the defendant as

  a   husband     and   wife   had   already   come   to   an     end     and   sought

  declaration in his favour that  marriage  between the parties  has been

  dissolved by virtue of TALAKNAMA dated 23.4.2008 and a decree of

  permanent   injunction,   restraining   the   defendant     from   calling     and

  treating  the plaintiff,  as her husband,  in future  and also restraining her

  from interfering into  the personal life and liberty of the plaintiff.

</p><p id="p_10">9. The ld.trial court issued the summons  of the suit to the defendant. On

  service     of   the   summon   to   the   defendants   has   filed   the     Written

  Statement.
</p>
<p id="p_11">10.The defendant has filed the Written Statement and contested the case

  on the grounds interalia that the amount of MEHAR  of Rs 10,000/­ has

  not been paid by the plaintiff. She has   admitted the consummation of

  the NIKAH and birth of the girl child out of the wedlock. She has denied

  the   announcement   of     TALAK     on   dated   20.4.2008   for   want   of   her

  knowledge.   She   has   denied   the   other   averments   of   the   plaintiff   as

  mentioned in the plaint and stated that the  plaintiff  has no right  to give
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                               5</span>

    her TALAK.
</p>
<p id="p_12">11.It is pertinent to mention here  that the defendant has also taken certain

    additional pleas in her Written Statement and stated  that plaintiff has no

    locus standi to file the suit. She has also stated  that the plaintiff  was not

    satisfied with the dowry and also alleged that  she was also tortured. She

    has   levelled   the   allegations   of   the     demand   of   dowry.   She   has   also

    alleged that she  has seen the plaintiff in an objectionable condition with

    his brother's wife namely Smt Firoza   and levelled   allegation   of   illicit

    relation of plaintiff and Smt Firoza and she  has sought  the dismissal of

    the suit of the plaintiff.
</p>
<p id="p_13">12. The plaintiff has filed the replication  to the written statement. He has

    denied   the averments made by the defendant in her written statement

    and he retreated  and reaffirmed  the averments made in his plaint and

    prayed for  the relief sought in the suit.
</p>
<p id="p_14">13.From the pleadings of the parties the ld.trial court was pleased  to form

    the following issues:­

</p><p id="p_15">    (i) Whether the plaintiff  is entitled for a decree of declaration and         

        permanent injunction  as prayed  in the suit?OPP.

</p><p id="p_16">     (ii) Relief.
</p>
<p id="p_17">         

</p><p id="p_18">14.The   ld.trial   court,     while   passing     the     judgment   under   appeal,   was
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                            6</span>

  pleased to pass the decree of declaration   in favour of the plaintiff and

  against the defendant, whereas the relief   of permanent injunction was

  refused.
</p>
<p id="p_19">15.Accordingly, the issue  no.1 qua the declaration was decided  in favour

  of the plaintiff.
</p>
<p id="p_20">16.Feeling   aggrieved     with   the   judgment   and   decree   dated   3.12.2009

  passed by the ld. trial  court, the defendant/appellant has preferred the

  present appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_21">17.The notice of the appeal was issued to  the respondent, on completion

  of his service. He has put his appearance  through his counsel. 

</p><p id="p_22">18.The record of the ld. trial  court is requestioned  and perused.

</p><p id="p_23">19.I have heard the  ld.counsel for  the parties and perused the record.

</p><p id="p_24">20.The ld.counsel   for the appellant has submitted that the judgment and

  decree under appeal is not sustainable in the eyes  of law as the TALAK

  has not been pronounced by the respondent/plaintiff in the presence of

  the   appellant.He has further submitted that   the judgment and decree

  under   appeal     is   based   on   the   false     testimonies     of   the

  respondent/plaintiff and his witnesses and prayed for   the dismissal   of

  the suit of the plaintiff, by way of allowing her appeal.

</p><p id="p_25">21.On   the   other   hand   the   ld.counsel     for   the   respondent/plaintiff   has

  submitted   that     the   respondent/plaintiff   has   successfully     proved     on
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                                 7</span>

  record that the   appellant/defendant   had never   discharged her moral

  duties   toward   the   respondent/plaintiff     she   misbehaved   and   with   the

  respondent/plaintiff and on dated 12.3.2008, she had   withdrawn from

  the society of the respondent/plaintiff without any reason.

</p><p id="p_26">22.He has further submitted that   the appellant/defendant   even did not

  think   about   the   future   of   the   female   child,   prior   to   the   leaving   of   her

  matrimonial home.
</p>
<p id="p_27">23.He has further  submitted  that the respondent/plaintiff made efforts  to

  settle the matter and he requested to the appellant/defendant to return

  to   her   matrimonial     home,   for   the     sake   of   the   child.   But,   the

  appellant/defendant   refused   to     join   the   company     of   the

  respondent/plaintiff and even threatened him to implicate in false case

  and   feeling   aggrieved   from   such   acts   of   the     appellant/defendant,   on

  dated 20.4.2008, the respondent/plaintiff had pronounced TALAK to the

  appellant/defendant   triple times in the presence of two witnesses and

  these two witnesses have been examined in the trial court to prove  this

  factum.
</p>
<p id="p_28">24.The ld.counsel   for the respondent/plaintiff has further   submitted that

  TALAKNAMA  is also reduced into writing which is Ex. PW1/A and postal

  receipt, UPC and money order receipt and copy of    the TALAKNAMA

  have also been proved on the record.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                               8</span><p id="p_29">

</p><p id="p_30">25.He   has   further     submitted   that   the   appellant/defendant     has   levelled

  false allegation  of adultery,but, she has failed to  prove such allegation

  on the record.   He has further  submitted  that  there is no infirmity  in

  the   judgment   of   the   trial   court   and     prayed   for   the   dismissal   of   the

  appeal. 
</p>
<p id="p_31">26.I have given thoughtful  consideration to the submissions  made by the

  ld.counsel  for the parties.
</p>
<p id="p_32">27.In the case in hand, the respondent/plaintiff has  also claimed the relief

  of the permanent injunction for  restraining  the appellant/defendant from

  interfering in his personal life and  liberty. This relief  is refused  by the

  ld. trial  court . The respondent/plaintiff has not challanged the findings of

  the ld. trial court.  So,  the judgment of the ld. trial court is confirmed  to

  that extent.
</p>
<p id="p_33">28.From the testimony of the petitioner, it is proved on the record  that the

  appellant/defendant used to misbehave with the respondent/plaintiff and

  she has withdrawn from the society of the respondent/plaintiff without

  any reason on dated 12.3.2008 and when  the respondent/plaintiff  made

  efforts to bring the appellant/defendant back   to her matrimonial home,

  she flatly refused   to join the company   of the respondent/plaintiff and

  she also threatened to implicate him  in false  case  and when his effort

  for   reconcilliation   got   fail   only   then,   on   dated   20.4.2008   the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                           9</span>

  respondent/plaintiff has pronounced TALAK triple times in the presence

  of the PW2 and PW3. The pronouncement of TALAK  triple times is well

  proved by the PW2 and PW3. 
</p>
<p id="p_34">29.The absence of the  appellant/defendant will not affect the validity of the

  TALAK, as the TALAK may be pronounced in the absence of wife. The

  testimony   of     the   plaintiff         has   gone   unrebutted,   uncontroverted,

  unchallanged  and unimpeached on the material points.

</p><p id="p_35">30.No doubt, that the Muslim male enjoy unbridlled  authority to  liquidate

  the   marriage. But,   the Holy Quaran expressly forbids a man to seek

  pretexts for divorcing his wife  so long as, she remains  obedient to him.

</p><p id="p_36">31.The law is well settled that   the TALAK   must be   pronounced for   a

  reasonable   cause   and   it   must   be   preceeded   by   an     attempt   of

  reconcilliation between the husband and wife.
</p>
<p id="p_37">32.The   study     of   para   310   of   "MULLA     ON   THE   PRINCIPLES   OF

  MOHAMMEDAN LAW '' makes it crystal clear that presence of wife is

  not necessary  at the time of pronouncement of the TALAK.

</p><p id="p_38">33.So, I do not find any force in the  submissions of the ld.counsel for the

  appellant  that  as the TALAK has been pronounced by the respondent

  in the absence  of appellant, so it is not valid.
</p>
<p id="p_39">34.From the unrebutted testimony of the respondent/plaintiff, it is proved

  on the record that the appellant/defendant used to misbehave with the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                           10</span>

  respondent/plaintiff.   She   has   withdrawn   from   the   society   of   the

  respondent/plaintiff and his efforts for reconcilliation have been   made

  fail by the appellant/defendant and he was also threatened that he will

  be implicated  in false case.
</p>
<p id="p_40">35.In   my     considered   opinion,   the   respondent/plaintiff   has   given     the

  divorce for the reasonable cause. The pronouncement of   the TALAK

  has been well proved by PW2 and PW3.
</p>
<p id="p_41">36.The   testimony   of   trio   witnesses   have   gone   unimpeached.   The

  documents   relied upon   by the plaintiff have been duly   proved. The

  onus to prove  that the  plaintiff is entitled to the declaration sought, was

  on the plaintiff and  the plaintiff has successfully  discharged his burden

  of   proving.   The   appellant/defendant     has   leveled   the   allegations   of

  adultery against the respondent/plaintiff but she has failed to bring forth

  any   coegent   evidence   to   prove   such   allegations.   Accordingly,   the

  allegations leveled by the appellant/defendant are held to be vague and

  bald. The   testimonies of the   defendant and her witnesses are of no

  help for her.
</p>
<p id="p_42">37.Accordingly, I do not find any force in the  submissions  made by  the

  ld.counsel for the appellant, whereas,   I am having full   inclination with

  the submissions made by  the ld.counsel  for the respondent/plaintiff.

</p><p id="p_43">38.Since the respondent/plaintiff   has successfully proved on the   record
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                         11</span>

  that  he   is entitled  to the declaration  sought. So,  the findings of the ld.

  trial court  on Issue no. 1 stands confirmed and upheld. I do not find any

  infirmity   in the judgment and decree under appeal, passed   by the ld.

  trial  court,  which  may require any interference therein.

</p><p id="p_44">39.In view of the above discussions, the judgment and decree  passed by

  the  ld. trial court  stand upheld and the appeal  of the appellant stands

  dismissed being devoid of merit. Decree sheet be prepared accordingly

  and file be consigned to the record room.  The record of the ld. trial court

  is ordered to be returned.
