<p id="p_4">              The son of the petitioner was married to respondent No. 2 in

<p id="p_5">and her daughter are also US citizens.           The petitioner is a widow.

Respondent No. 2 at that time was pursuing a nursing course and wanted to

complete the course. The petitioner's son alone went back in February 2010.

Soon thereafter respondent No. 2 shifted out of the matrimonial home and

went to her hostel in Kurali. The son of the petitioner was deported from

America in September 2010. The FIR was lodged in February 2012 against

the husband, mother-in-law and elder brother of the father-in-law. The son

of the petitioner died in August 2013.
</p>
<p id="p_6">             The allegations levelled by respondent No. 2 are that the

petitioner was in America and she used to instigate her son on the telephone

and her husband threw her out of the house in November 2010 and a

demand of Rs. 3.00 lacs was made and all the istri dhan and dowry articles

were used by her in-laws and she was beaten.
</p>
<p id="p_7">             The complainant had admitted that she had stayed with her

husband for 45 days and thereafter the husband went abroad and she went

back to college to complete her nursing course. She had also alleged that

while she was pursuing her course, no expenses were given by the in-laws.

The husband later was deported back. Allegations were also levelled that

the husband used to drink everyday and beat her. Towards the end of the

complaint it had been alleged that mother-in-law was going back to US

and the police should initiate proceedings to stop her from leaving the

country.
</p>
<p id="p_8">             Though the complaint was given in May 2011, the FIR was

lodged in February 2012. The petitioner was abroad when she was declared

proclaimed offender. She returned to the country and was allowed to appear

before the Court below and charge has also been framed.</p><pre id="pre_2">

<p id="p_10">             Counsel for the petitioner contends that the petitioner is living

in US and her husband had died and the petitioner's son was married to the

complainant but had died in August 2013 and the couple lived together for a

short period and the only allegation against the petitioner is that she used to

instigate her son over the phone and the main allegations are against the

husband.    It was urged that the marriage took place in 2009 and the

complaint had been given after two years and the stay of the petitioner in

India was very short. It was urged that the allegations under <a href="/doc/988620/" id="a_3">Section 406</a>

IPC are against the husband.
</p>
<p id="p_11">             The submissions on the other hand were that the police had

completed the investigation and the petitioner was declared a proclaimed

offender and now charge has been framed and it is for the trial Court to see

whether the charges were made out or not and the petitioner has not

challenged the charge and it should be left to the trial Court to decide the

matter after examining the evidence.

             either on their advice or with their concurrence. The learned

             members of the Bar who belong to a noble profession must

             maintain its noble traditions and should treat every complaint

             under <a href="/doc/538436/" id="a_18">section 498-A</a> as a basic human problem and must make

             serious endeavour to help the parties in arriving at an

             amicable resolution of that human problem. They must

             discharge their duties to the best of their abilities to ensure

             that social fiber, peace and tranquility of the society remains

             intact. The members of the Bar should also ensure that one

             complaint should not lead to multiple cases.

             dealing with these complaints and must take pragmatic

             realities into consideration while dealing with matrimonial

             cases. The allegations of harassment of husband's close

             relations who had been living in different cities and never

             visited or rarely visited the place where the complainant

             resided would have an entirely different complexion. The

             allegations of the complaint are required to be scrutinized with

             great care and circumspection. Experience reveals that long

             and protracted criminal trials lead to rancour, acrimony and

             bitterness in the relationship amongst the parties. It is also a

             matter of common knowledge that in cases filed by the

             complainant if the husband or the husband's relations had to

             remain in jail even for a few days, it would ruin the chances of

             amicable settlement altogether. The process of suffering is

             extremely long and painful.

             exaggerated versions of the incident are reflected in a large
