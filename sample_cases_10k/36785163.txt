                     -------------------------------------------
                 Dated this the 28th day of November, 2017

                                  JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">         Petitioner is challenging Ext.P4 order issued by the Kerala

Agricultural University ('the University' for short) on 21.10.2017 by which

petitioner and another Assistant Professor were transferred to the College of

Agriculture, Padannakkad from their respective colleges with immediate

effect.  It was stated that the Associate Dean, College of Agriculture,

Padannakkad as per letter dated 17.10.2017 informed that the acute shortage

of teaching faculty in the college was drastically affecting the academic

program of the college.        Apart from that the Honourable Governor,

Government of Kerala and Chancellor of the University as well as the

Hon'ble Minister for Agriculture, Kerala and Pro Chancellor of the

University have directed the University to take immediate measures to

address the grievances of the students of the college of Agriculture at

Padannakkad.
</p>
<p id="p_2">       2.    Petitioner is an Associate Professor in Soil and Water

Conservation Engineering working at Kelappaji College of Agriculture

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">OP NO.                                2</span>

Engineering and Technology, Tavanur. He was granted Career advancement

promotion as Associate Professor as per Ext.P1 order dated 14.07.2016.

As per Ext.P4 order dated 21.10.2017, he is transferred to College of

Agriculture at Padannakkad.
</p>
<p id="p_3">      3.    The petitioner submits that on 27.10.2008, he was transferred

from Regional Agricultural Research Station, Pilicode to KCAET, Tavanur.

He also states that on an earlier occasion while he was working at Krishi

Vigyan Kendra, Manjeshwar in Kasaragod, he was transferred to Tavanur.

He had challenged his transfer to Pilicode ordered in 2008 and that this

Court in Ext.P2 order in R.P.No.11 of 2009, found that his transfer was on a

non existent reason and hence set aside the same. Petitioner alleges that his

present transfer is on extraneous consideration as a part of victimisation. He

points out that there is only 3 hours earmarked for his subject i.e Soil

Conservation and Water Engineering, for which there is already one

Professor and there is no post in Soil Conservation and Water Engineering.

</p><p id="p_4">      4.    The petitioner pointed out that he is already performing

outstation duty and he could not have been chosen for transfer. He alleges

that there are several teachers in the discipline in which teachers are

required and in his discipline also who are never subjected to any transfer.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">OP NO.                                3</span>

According to him, there are several teachers who are in need of a transfer to

Padannakad as well as several teachers who are working/residing in nearby

institutes/stations.
</p>
<p id="p_5">       5.     I.A. No.17530 of 2017 was filed seeking amendment of the writ

petition, producing Ext.P8 order of the 1st respondent issued on 27.09.2017,

directing 10 Assistant Professors in various disciplines, who were already

accorded sanction to rejoin duty after their study leave, to handle classes in

the College at Padannakkad, as was already instructed as per its order dated

15.08.2017. Simultaneously, 4 other teachers including two Professors and

one Associate Professor were also directed to handle classes at Padannakkad

without prejudice to their normal duties in their respective Colleges.

</p><p id="p_6">       6.     Ext.P9 is the list of UG Courses and PG courses run at the

College, and the time table at Padannakkad, as forwarded by the Associate

Dean to the teachers. According to the petitioner, the scarcity of teachers, as

seen from Ext.P9 is not in the discipline in which the petitioner is

qualified and there is no hours of study alloted or vacant slots in

which he can engage classes. The list of courses offered for M.Sc First

Semester and Second Semester would show that requirement of teachers

is in the subject Agronomy and for the course in Agronomy. It is

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">OP NO.                                  4</span>

therefore stated that his transfer is not at all required.

</p><p id="p_7">      7.     He also points out that he is neither the senior most nor the

junior most in the subject in the college in which he is working or in the

University. Therefore, there is no reason to choose him for the transfer.

Referring to Ext.P3 electoral roll, the petitioner has stated that there are a

number of teachers in various colleges in the discipline in which there is

shortage in the College at Padannakkad; but the respondents do not adopt

any proper procedure in accordance with norms to transfer those who

require a posting there. He has furnished the names of teachers who are

never transferred and that of certain teachers who did not join duty despite

the order of transfer. According to the petitioner, he has served in far off

stations several times and hence he is not liable to be transferred except

after his juniors or seniors are transferred. He further submits that he is

demoted by the transfer by posting him as an Assistant Professor. His

contention is that transfer can be effected only in accordance with the norms

formulated by the University and that has to be done after calling for

option.
</p>
<p id="p_8">      8.     In the counter affidavit filed by the 1st respondent the reason

stated is that there is acute shortage of teaching staff. Apart from that they

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">OP NO.                                  5</span>

have produced Exts.R1 to R8 documents, based on which the impugned

transfer order was issued. It is further stated that Ext.R8 order was issued on

27.9.2017 directing some of the teachers to render their services at the

College of Agriculture, Padannakkad during the first semester of the

academic year 2017-18 without affecting their normal duties. It is the case

of the respondents that the order of transfer was issued in the light of the

tense situation prevailing in the College of Agriculture, Padannakkad due to

students' unrest as informed by the Associate Dean based on which the

Chancellor as well as the Pro-Chancellor had directed to take immediate

action to solve the problem. It is also pointed out that out of the 781 posts

of teaching staff in the University, 50% of them are lying vacant and that

though the University is taking steps for recruitment of Assistant Professors,

since the process of direct recruitment is time consuming, the University has

decided to transfer some of the teachers to the College of Agriculture. It is

also pointed out that majority of the P.G courses in the college are having

practicals and the courses are designed to be taught by teachers with vast

experience and expertise in the research. It is further stated that the teaching

of the courses by Teaching Assistants and the teachers engaged on daily

wages has affected the quality of courses which affects the students

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">OP NO.                                   6</span>

adversely. It is also their case that the order of transfer is issued in public

interest and orders of transfer issued in public interest to protect the interest

of institution is not liable to be interfered with.
</p>
<p id="p_9">      9.     Ext.R1 is a letter dt.08.09.2017 of the Associate Dean

informing the Registrar that Dr.T.K.Bridgit, Professor and Head of

Department of Agronomy has informed that it will be extremely difficult to

offer courses to the P.G students for the academic year 2017-18 without a

minimum of 3 permanent teachers. It was pointed out that 2 teachers were

deputed last time for handling classes and that in the ensuing semesters

there are 4 post graduate and 6 under graduate courses; the teaching

assistants cannot handle post graduate classes. With the 2017 admissions,

the number of courses to be offered by the department will come to 9 to 10

(3 U.G courses plus 3 or 4 P.G courses); she is presently guiding 2 students

whose field works have already started and therefore guiding 3 more

students is practically impossible; majority of the courses are having

practicals; stating that the problem of shortage of teaching faculty is not

resolved even after repeated requests to the University, which adversely

affects the quality of teaching, to the prejudice of the students, she requested

to post at least 2 teachers in the department of Agronomy. List of courses

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">OP NO.                                    7</span>

</p><p id="p_11">       10.   Ext.R2 is a memorandum submitted by Sri N.Sreehari,

Secretary of SFI Unit, College of Agriculture, Padannakkad to the Registrar

pointing out the acute shortage of teaching faculty in the College. His

complaint is that: there are only about 10 permanent teachers as against the

required 65; at least 20 permanent teachers are required emergently, as the

regular process of recruitment initiated by the University is likely to take

time; appropriate action is necessary discontinuing the discriminatory

attitude towards the College of Agriculture, Padannakkad, failing which the

students would be compelled to resort to indefinite strike. Ext.R3 is also a

letter of Sri. Sreehari, addressed to the Chief Minister pointing out the

shortage of teachers in the College complaining inaction in solving the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">OP NO.                                 8</span>

problem, even after assurances. He complained that the students as well as

the College of Agriculture, Padannakad were totally neglected and are

subjected to discriminatory treatment. He stated that about 10 teachers were

deputed for undergoing Ph.D and even the teachers, who are interested in

working at Padannakkad are transferred to far off place. Ext.R4 is his letter

to the Vice Chancellor on the very same issue informing that the students

will have to resort to strike in case the problem is not solved immediately.

Ext.R5 is a report of the Registrar with respect to the queries/clarifications

sought in respect of the situation in the college with respect to the

complaints on the shortage of teachers. The Registrar informed that as per

order dated 27.9.2017 (Ext.R8), all the 10 teachers who completed their

study leave and 4     teachers who are working in other centres of the

University were directed to take classes in the College at Padannakad. It

was also informed that the University has, as per notification dated

03.03.2016 initiated proceedings for fresh selection of Assistant Professors

and steps are afoot for publication of rank list and the vacancies in the

teaching posts in the College would be filled up on its finalisation. Ext.R6 is

the letter dated 07.10.2017 addressed to the Vice Chancellor of the

University from the Secretary to Governor calling for a report on the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">OP NO.                                    9</span>

complaint of Sri. Sreehari informing that the students will resort to protests

and strike in case the problem of shortage of teaching faculties in the

College was not solved. Ext.R7 is a letter dated 20.10.2017, from the

Minister for Agriculture directing to take emergents steps on the issue,

forwarding the complaint he received from the SFI leader Sreehari.

</p><p id="p_12">      11.   On consideration of the rival contentions on either side, it is

clear that there is acute shortage of teaching faculties in the College of

Agriculture, Padannakad.        It is also seen that the order transferring the

petitioner issued on 21.10.2017, was pursuant to the instructions the

respondents received from the Governor and the Minister for Agriculture

who are the Chancellor and Pro-Chancellor respectively of the University

to take steps to solve the problems faced by the College. It would appear

that the order of transfer is issued in public interest and normally in such

circumstances, this Court will not be justified in interfering with such a transfer.

</p><p id="p_13">      12.   But the specific case of the petitioner, with the support of the

time table and the letter of the Associate Dean of the College is that there is

no shortage or any course of study, which the petitioner can handle,

available in the institution. The 1st respondent has not answered the

contention of the petitioner that there is no shortage in the discipline in

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">OP NO.                                  10</span>

which he is qualified, i.e in Soil Science and Water Engineering.

</p><p id="p_14">      13.    In the counter affidavit there is no answer to the specific

contention of the petitioner in the writ petition as well as the affidavit in

support of the I. A for amendment, that there is no scarcity in the discipline

in which the petitioner can engage classes and that scarcity is in other

subjects. Even though the learned Standing Counsel furnished a list

containing the details of the course run in the college, the posts sanctioned,

vacancies, etc., I am unable to arrive at any conclusion from it as to any

requirement of a teacher in Social Science and Water Engineering.

Petitioner's contention is that there is only 3 hours for which there is already

a Professor working in the College and that he is not competent to take

classes in any subject in which he is not qualified, as provided in the UGC

Regulations.
</p>
<p id="p_15">      14.    Even though the norms itself provide for transfers in public

interest notwithstanding any of the other provisions in the norms and

transfers are permissible in public interest, especially to meet the immediate

requirement of teachers in a college, transfer of the petitioner, in case there

is no shortage for the subject he can handle, as per UGC Regulations,

cannot be permitted.
</p>
<p id="p_16"><span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">OP NO.                                11</span>

</p><p id="p_17">      There cannot be any dispute on the power vested in the University to

transfer a teacher from one College to another. But when the transfer is

ordered to meet the shortage of teaching faculty and the allegation of the

petitioner relying on materials produced before this Court is that there is no

shortage in the discipline of Soil and Water Conservation Engineering and

that allegation is not controverted, I deem it fit to direct the respondent to

consider the specific contention of the petitioner, after affording an

opportunity of hearing to him, and to pass orders within a period of three

weeks. Till such time, the operation of Ext.P4 order to the extent it relates to

the petitioner shall be kept in abeyance.
</p>
<p id="p_18">      The writ petition is disposed of with the above directions.
