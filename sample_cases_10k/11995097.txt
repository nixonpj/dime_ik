                                           JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">1.             By this judgment I shall decide the present suit for recovery 

     of Rs. 3,67,864/­ which has been filed by the plaintiff bank against 

     the defendant under provisions of Order 37 CPC thereby alleging 

     that the defendant approached and requested the plaintiff bank for 

     grant of  loan of Rs.3,25,000/­ under the loan scheme of the plaintiff 

     bank and applied for the loan for the purchase of a vehicle namely 

     Indica DLS bearing registration no.UP­06P­9508.

</p><p id="p_2">2.             It   is   further   alleged   that   the   plaintiff   bank   accepted   the 

     request of  the defendant and sanctioned as well as disbursed the 

     loan   of   Rs.3,25,000/­   in   terms   of   loan   agreement   no. 

     LADEL00009720840 dated 27.02.07 and disbursement memo  and 

     that   the   defendant   executed   loan   agreement   and   several   other 

     documents in favour of the plaintiff bank.
</p>
<p id="p_3">3.             The plaintiff further alleged that the defendant agreed and 

     under took to pay the amount of loan with interest in 35 equated 

     monthly   installments   of  Rs.11,602/­   each  and   that   the   defendant 

     further   agreed   that   in   case     any   installment   is   delayed   then   the 

     defendant   would   pay   a   penal   interest   as   contained   in   the   loan 

     agreement per month on the outstanding monthly installment.  



</p><p id="p_4">CS No. 462/9/10                                                             Page 2 of  5
</p><p id="p_5"> 4.             It is further alleged that thereafter the defendant failed to 

     adhere to the financial discipline of the repayment of the equated 

     monthly installments either towards principal or interest or charges 

     thereon   and several installments became due and payable and the 

     defendant failed to up date the account despite repeated reminders. 

     That thereafter the defendant was served with reminders and loan 

     recall   cum   demand   notice   dated   25.07.09   but   despite   that   the 

     defendant failed to make the payment.
</p>
<p id="p_6">5.             It is further alleged that as per the accounts maintained by 

     the plaintiff the defendant is liable to pay a sum of Rs.3,67,864/­ 

     towards principal, interest, penal interest, legal charges and other 

     dues as on date. Hence the suit has been filed under provisions of 

     Order 37 CPC. 
</p>
<p id="p_7">6.             Since the suit has been  filed under provisions of order 37 

     CPC   so   special   summons   in   prescribed   proforma   were   issued 

     against defendant by ordinary process as well as through speed post 

     but   the   summons   received   back   with   report   "defendant   has   left 

     without   address".     Thereafter,   the   plaintiff   bank   moved   an 

     application for affecting service of summons in prescribed proforma 

     on defendant by way of substituted mode of service i.e. by way of 



CS No. 462/9/10                                                        Page 3 of  5
    publication and the defendant was served by way of publication in 

   the   newspaper   'Statesman'   of   dated   24.11.2010   and   as   such   the 

   defendant   was   duly   served   with   the   special   summons   but   the 

   defendant failed to enter his appearance within the stipulated period. 

</p><p id="p_8">7.           I have heard the counsel for plaintiff  and gone through the 

   records   carefully.     Since   the   defendant   has   failed   to   file   his 

   appearance within the stipulated time and as such I am satisfied that 

   the defendant has nothing to say about the case of the plaintiff bank. 

</p><p id="p_9">8.           It is not out of place to mention here that along with suit, 

   the plaintiff also filed an application under Order 40 Rule 1 read 

   with   section   151   CPC   for   appointment   of   a   Receiver   to   take 

   possession of vehicle in question and vide Order dated 27.08.09 of 

   Ld.  Predecessor,   a  Receiver was appointed to take possession of 

   vehicle   in   question,   i.e.   Indica   DLS   bearing   registration 

   no.UP­06P­9508 but the vehicle could not be re­possessed.

</p><p id="p_10">9.            The plaintiff bank in  the present suit has claimed a  total 

   amount of Rs.3,67,864/­ as due against defendant and a  perusal of 

   statement of account shows that the plaintiff bank has also included 

   a   sum   of   Rs.14,119.61   as   foreclosure   charges   @   5.52%   at   O/S 

   principal.  
</p>
<p id="p_11">

</p><p id="p_12">CS No. 462/9/10                                                        Page 4 of  5
</p><p id="p_13"> 10.          However, the plaintiff bank has not placed on record any 

   document which may show that there was an agreement between the 

   parties   that   the   plaintiff   bank   is   entitled   to   recover   foreclosure 

   charges   @   5.52%.     Moreover,   during   course   of   arguments,   Ld. 

   Counsel for the plaintiff also failed to show any document on the 

   basis of which the plaintiff bank can recover this amount towards 

   foreclosure charges.    
</p>
<p id="p_14">11.          For the foregoing reasons,  the suit of the plaintiff is partly 

   decreed and  a decree is passed in favour of the plaintiff bank and 

   against   the   defendant   in   the   sum   of   Rs.3,53,744.39   along   with 

   proportionate costs of the suit. Plaintiff is also entitled   to recover 

   interest @ 12% p.a. from the date of filing of the suit till realization 

   of the decretal amount.   After preparation of decree sheet, file be 

   consigned to Record Room.</p><pre id="pre_2">
