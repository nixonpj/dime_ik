                                       `




</pre><p id="p_4">3.           The facts appearing from the written report lodged
     by Sudhir Pramanik (P.W.-11) is that Kiran Kumari, minor
     daughter of the informant was found missing from
     intervening night of 19/20 August, 1998. It is disclosed
     that previously Kiran Kumari (deceased) was taking tuition
     from the appellant but he was keeping evil eyes on her
     and, therefore, the parent of Kiran Kumari restrained her
     from having tuition from the appellant. It is further
     disclosed the appellant was always roaming around the
     house of informant in order to meet Kiran Kumari. The
     informant, suspecting hands of appellant in the abduction
     of Kiran Kumari had lodged written report and on the
     basis of said written report, Baliapur P.S. Case No. 79/98
     dated 20.08.1998, under <a href="/doc/1559723/" id="a_11">Section 366A</a> of the Indian Penal
     Code was registered.
</p><p id="p_5">             The investigation was carried out. The appellant
     was apprehended and dead body of Kiran Kumari was
     recovered from Hariban. The inquest report was prepared,
     incriminating   articles   were       seized,   witnesses              were
     examined and after concluding investigation, chargesheet
     was submitted and accordingly, cognizance was taken. The
     case was committed to the Court of Sessions and
     registered as S.T. No. 24/ 2000. Charges under <a href="/doc/1559723/" id="a_12">Sections
     366A</a>, <a href="/doc/1279834/" id="a_13">376</a>, <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_14">302</a>, <a href="/doc/1535430/" id="a_15">328</a> and <a href="/doc/386021/" id="a_16">201</a> of the Indian Penal Code
     were framed to which the appellant pleaded not guilty and
     claimed to be tried.
</p><p id="p_6">            The prosecution in order to substantiate charges
     examined altogether eleven witnesses including informant,
     investigating officer and the doctor who conducted autopsy
     on the dead body of Kiran Kumari and proved documents
                            3                 Criminal Appeal (DB) No. 293 of 2009
                                    `




     whereas no witness has been examined by the appellants
     in his defence.
</p><p id="p_7">            The learned Trial Judge, at the conclusion of trial,
     placing reliance on the evidence and documents available
     on record, held the appellant guilty and inflicted sentence
     as indicated above.
</p><p id="p_8">4.           On behalf of the appellant it is submitted that the
     impugned Judgment of conviction and sentence is highly
     erroneous, based on misappropriation of evidence and the
     Judgment is liable to be set aside on facts as well as in
     law. Admittedly there is no eye witness to the occurrence.
     Nobody had seen victim Kiran Kumari in company of
     appellant on the alleged date of occurrence till recovery of
     the dead body. Only on suspicion the appellant has been
     held guilty and the suspicion however it may strong,
     cannot be the basis of conviction. The circumstantial
     evidence brought on record by the prosecution is not
     leading to guilt of the appellant. On surmises and
     conjecture, he has been held guilty and the Judgment of
     conviction and sentence is not liable to be sustained.
</p><p id="p_9">             The prosecution has tried to make out a case that
     dead body of Kiran Kumari was discovered on the basis of
     confession made by the appellant but the evidence on
     record is insufficient to prove that dead body of Kiran
     Kumari was recovered on the pointing out of the appellant.
     No confessional statement has been proved. P.Ws.-1 and 2
     are the witnesses to inquest but they did not say that dead
     body was recovered at the instance of the appellant. The
     informant in his deposition in paragraph-18 has stated
     that after arrival of Police they had been searching for
     Kiran Kumari for whole of the night in Hariban but they
                     4                   Criminal Appeal (DB) No. 293 of 2009
                               `




could not find her. If the version of informant is correct,
the question of leading to discovery of dead body of Kiran
Kumari at the instance of appellant does not arise at all.
Only the family members i.e. P.Ws. - 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11
have stated that dead body of Kiran Kumari was recovered
from Hariban at the instance of appellant. Oral evidence
brought on record by these witnesses, does not find
support from any document. The inquest report does not
bear signature of the appellant. It was expected, if the dead
body was recovered at the instance of appellant, his
signature should have been taken.
</p><p id="p_10">        Besides the recovery of dead body, the evidence of
Doctor (P.W.-6) indicates that the deceased was carrying
pregnancy of 6 - 7 months but no witness has stated as to
how she became pregnant and by whom. The admitted
evidence of P.W.-11 who is none else but father of the
deceased, is that the deceased had taken tuition from the
appellant till 1995. She had appeared for her matriculation
examination in the year 1996. After her tuition was
discontinued, they did not allow Kiran Kumari to go out of
the house alone and strict vigil was kept on her. No
witness has come forward to say that the deceased was
having illicit relation with the appellant and she was
frequently meeting with him rather evidence on record is
contrary to that and the witnesses have stated that Kiran
Kumari was not allowed to meet the appellant after her
tuition was discontinued.
</p><p id="p_11">        The prosecution has miserably failed to bring it on
record as to with whom the deceased was having illicit
relation and by whom she became pregnant. Furthermore,
pregnancy of seven months could not be concealed and it
                           5                 Criminal Appeal (DB) No. 293 of 2009
                                   `




     would be visible but the parent and relatives of the
     deceased did not disclose in their deposition that Kiran
     Kumari was pregnant at the time of her death. The facts
     and circumstances available on record constitute many
     questions to be answered by the prosecution. Had those
     questions been answered, the murder mystery of Kiran
     Kumari should have been solved. In the circumstances,
     the impugned Judgment cannot be upheld and the same is
     liable to be set aside.
</p><p id="p_12">5.           Learned APP has opposed the arguments and
     submitted that no cross examination to P.Ws. - 7 and 8
     has been done and, therefore, the evidence adduced by
     them stand intact. The investigating officer has also not
     been cross examined by the counsel appearing for the
     appellant in the Court below. The appellant was given
     opportunity to cross examine the investigating officer and
     he had put certain formal questions regarding place of
     recovery of dead body and the manner in which it was
     recovered. P.Ws.-7 to 11 have clearly stated that dead body
     of deceased was recovered at the instance of appellant.
     According to statement of Dr. Sailendra Kumar (P.W.-6)
     death of Kiran Kumari was homicidal and she died due to
     asphyxia as a result of strangulation. Nail marks were
     present on her neck and other superficial injuries like
     abrasion and bruise were present on the person of
     deceased. There was motive for the appellant to commit
     murder because he wanted to get rid of her. Kiran Kumari
     was willing to marry him but he was not intending so. The
     prosecution has proved its case beyond shadow of
     reasonable doubt that the appellant has committed
     murder of Kiran Kumari in a planned manner.
</p><pre id="pre_3">                          6                      Criminal Appeal (DB) No. 293 of 2009
                                      `




</pre><p id="p_13">6.           After hearing both the parties, we have perused the
     case record, examined documents and carefully gone
     through the impugned Judgment. Dr. Sailendra Kumar
     (P.W.-6) who had conducted postmortem examination on
     the   dead   body   of   Kiran   Kumari,      has       proved           the
     postmortem report and deposed that death of Kiran
     Kumari was homicidal and she died due to asphyxia as a
     result of strangulation. Some poisonous substance were
     detected in the stomach and its contents. We do not find
     any conclusive report that content found in the stomach
     was having poisonous substance. We do not find any
     report from Forensic Science Laboratory on this point.
</p><p id="p_14">             The evidence of the Doctor (P.W.-6) and the
     postmortem report do not indicate that the deceased was
     subjected to rape prior to her death. The Doctor has given
     conclusive opinion that no sign of rape was found at the
     time of postmortem examination. In view of the evidence of
     Doctor and the postmortem report, we are not inclined to
     sustain conviction and sentence recorded under <a href="/doc/1535430/" id="a_17">Section
     328</a> and <a href="/doc/1279834/" id="a_18">376</a> of the Indian Penal Code.
</p><p id="p_15">7.          The learned trial Judge has held the appellant
     guilty for the offence punishable under <a href="/doc/619940/" id="a_19">Section 363</a> of the
     Indian Penal Code but the evidence on record does not
     indicate that Kiran Kumari, minor girl, was procured from
     her lawful guardianship without consent of her parent. No
     direct evidence on record is available to show that the
     appellant had kidnapped Kiran Kumari on the alleged date
     of occurrence.
</p><p id="p_16">            Now the conviction and sentence recorded under
     <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_20">Section 302</a> and <a href="/doc/386021/" id="a_21">201</a> of the Indian Penal Code are left to be
     discussed. As per the evidence of P.W.-12 (investigating
                       7                    Criminal Appeal (DB) No. 293 of 2009
                                  `




officer), the appellant had confessed that Kiran Kumari
after being conceived had been compelling the appellant to
marry her but he was not intending so. To get rid of her,
he has killed Kiran Kumari.
</p><p id="p_17">          We   do   agree,   to   decide   a   case        based          on
circumstantial evidence, motive plays an important role.
Here in the case at hand, the motive behind the murder as
disclosed by P.W.-12 does not find support from evidence
of material witnesses. The family members who have been
examined as P.Ws. - 7 to 11 have not stated that due to
illicit relation prevailing between the deceased and the
appellant, the deceased conceived and she was intending
to marry the appellant and for that she had been creating
pressure. No family member of the deceased has ever
admitted that the deceased was pregnant at the time of her
abduction and murder. Contrary to that, the father (P.W.-
</p><p id="p_18">11) has stated that the deceased was stopped from going
tuition since the year 1995. She had appeared for her
matriculation examination in the year 1996. She was not
allowed to meet the appellant at any point of time and she
was kept under vigil. If the evidence of father and other
witnesses are correct, the deceased never met with the
appellant after the year 1995 and, therefore, the question
of sexual relation established between them does not arise
at all.
</p><p id="p_19">          The occurrence took place in the month of August,
1998. The deceased was carrying pregnancy of about 24 to
28 weeks as per the evidence of Doctor (P.W.-6). No family
members who have been examined as P.W.-7 to P.W.-11
have ever stated that the deceased was having sexual
relation with the appellant during that period rather they
                         8                      Criminal Appeal (DB) No. 293 of 2009
                                    `




     have outrightly rejected it. They did not admit that the
     deceased was having sexual relation with the appellant.
     Therefore, the evidence on record does not indicate as to
     how and when and by whom the deceased conceived.
</p><p id="p_20">            Again we would like to bring it on record that no
     confessional   statement    has    been      proved           by        the
     prosecution. The evidence of investigating officer that
     appellant had confessed that he wanted to get rid of Kiran
     Kumari and that was the reason that he killed her, does
     not find support from the evidence of P.Ws.-7 to 11. They
     did not say that the appellant before them had ever
     admitted and confessed that he wanted to get rid of Kiran
     Kumari because of the reason she got pregnant and
     wanted to marry him.
</p><p id="p_21">            In view of the discussions made above, we do not
     find that evidence available on record, either proves motive
     behind the murder or the dead body of Kiran Kumari was
     recovered at the instance of appellant and he had
     confessed his guilt. We do not find that chain of
     circumstantial evidence brought on record are complete
     leading unerringly towards guilt of the appellant excluding
     all hypothecation of his innocence rather we find that the
     evidence available on record is highly suspicious and the
     witnesses have not disclosed true facts behind the
     occurrence and the investigation done is also suffering
     from various lacunae and the investigating officer had not
     tried to unturn all stone to find out the truth. We do not
     find evidence on record sufficient to sustain conviction and
     sentence recorded against the appellant.

     inclined to allow this appeal. Accordingly, this appeal is
                                  9                     Criminal Appeal (DB) No. 293 of 2009
