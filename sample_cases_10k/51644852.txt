   defendants   jointly   and   severally   alongwith   pendente   lite   and

   future interest @ 15% pa till the realization of the suit amount.

   The suit of the plaintiff is that the plaintiff is a limited company

   and   engaged   in   the   business   of   manufacturing,   trading   and

   distribution of computer hardware, its components and mobiles

   etc.   The   present   suit   has   been   filed   through   its   Assistant

   Manager Legal and company secretary Shri Dinesh Kapoor who


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">Suit No. 348/09                                                       Page 2 of 21</span>
   is duly authorised to file, sign and verify the present suit by way

  of   board   resolution   dated   15.12.2006.   Defendant   no.1   is   a

  partnership firm of defendant no.2 and defendant no.3 who are

  running   their   partnership   firm   in   the   name   of   M/s   Vijay

  Technologies  ie defendant  No.1 which is dealing in trading  of

  computer   hardware,   its   components   and   mobiles.   Defendant

  no.2   and   3   are   responsible   for   all   the   business   affairs   and

  dealings of the said partnership firm. Defendant no.2 had been

  known to the plaintiff prior to the year 2004 since he had been

  dealing with plaintiff for and on behalf of another firm/group of

  companies known as M/s Chandra Online.com. Defendant no.2

  during those years had been dealing with sale and purchase  for

  the   said   M/s   Chandra   Online.com   and   had   been   signing

  cheques/   demand   drafts   on   behalf   of   the   said   company.

  Defendant no.2 in the month of February 2004 approached the

  plaintiff and informed and represented to the plaintiff that he was

  running the business of computer hardware and mobiles under

  the   name   of   his   partnership   firm   M/s   Vijay   Technologies   and

  further informed and represented to the plaintiff that defendant

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">Suit No. 348/09                                                     Page 3 of 21</span>
   no.3 is the other partner of defendant no.1 firm. Defendant no. 2

  at that time also informed and represented to the plaintiff that

  the said M/sVijay Technologies i.e. Defendant no. 1 also belong

  to   Chandra   group   of   company   along   with   M/s   Chandra

  online.com and the said firm/companies have common business

  interest,   investments   and   dealings.     On   the   basis   of   said

  representation   defendant   no.   2   approached   the   plaintiff   in

  February,   2004   to   supply   computer   hardware   and   mobile   to

  defendant   no.   1.     The   defendant   no.   1,2   and   3   raised   a

  purchased order dated 28.02.2004 upon plaintiff and asked with

  plaintiff to supply the said items at Jaipur.  Defendant no. 2 held

  negotiations for and on behalf of all the defendants with plaintiff

  at Delhi.  On the basis of negotiations made by defendant no 2

  for and on behalf of all  the defendants at Delhi, the Delhi office

  of plaintiff agreed to supply goods to defendant no. 1, 2 and 3

  and   the   officers   of   the   plaintiff   at   Delhi   instructed   the   branch

  office   at   Jaipur   to   supply   the   goods   to   the   defendants.     The

  plaintiff   on   the   basis   of   said   representation   promises   and

  assurances  of defendant  no. 2 and in good faith  supplied the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">Suit No. 348/09                                                         Page 4 of 21</span>
   Ben Q  mobiles/items to defendants no. 1, 2 and 3.  The plaintiff

  raised   the   invoices   upon   defendants   no.   1   2   and   3   and

  maintained   the   current   and   running   accounts   of   dealings   with

  defendants   no.  1,2and  3.    The invoices  raised  by  the  plaintiff

  were duly received by defendants and the said invoices clearly

  mentioned   that   the     place   of   jurisdiction   between   the   parties

  shall be   Delhi.   The defendants duly accepted the goods and

  invoices and agreed to the terms and conditions.  Defendant no.

  2 for making payments with respect to the said supplies, issued

  several chques under the name of M/s Chandra Online.com to

  the   plaintiff.     At   the   time   of   issuance   of   the   said   cheque

  defendant no. 2 assured the plaintiff that he was duly authorised

  on   behalf   of   M/s   Vijay   Technologies   and   M/s   Chandra

  Online.com to issue the said cheques under the name of said

  firm.     He   also   assured   the   plaintiff   that   the   cheques

  issued/tendered   by   him   under   the   name   of   M/sChandra

  Online.com.     were   reconciled/adjusted   by   defendant   internally

  by   their   own   arrangement   with   M/s   Chandra   Online.com   and

  further   assured   to   the   plaintiff   that   he   was   duly   authorised   to

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">Suit No. 348/09                                                         Page 5 of 21</span>
   make such dealings.  Since, defendant no. 2 had been dealing

  with the plaintiff earlier also on behalf of M/s Chandra Online.

  Com, the plaintiff has no reason to disbelieve defendant no. 2.

  The   plaintiff   therefore   accepted   the   said   cheques   from

  defendants towards the said items/supplies to defendants.  The

  plaintiff   to   its   utter   shock   received   communication   dated

  05.05.2005   from   M/s   Chandra   Online.com   demanding

  Rs.5,34,927.56 from the plaintiff.   The plaintiff issued the reply

  notices dated 18.05.2005 and 15.07.2005 to the defendants and

  M/s Chandra Online.com calling upon them to withdraw the said

  demands   which   were   illegal   as   the   goods   had   already   been

  supplied to defendants.  The reply notices were duly received by

  defendants. The said M/s Chandra Online.com represented to

  the plaintiff that they  had nothing to do with defendants and had

  no such business collection/arrangement with the defendant as

  alleged   by   the   defendants   and   hence   further   alleged   that   the

  cheques of M/s Chandra Online.com had been wrongfully and

  illegally used by defendant no. 2 to make the payment to the

  plaintiff.  The said M/s Chandra Online.com therefore, refused to

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">Suit No. 348/09                                                    Page 6 of 21</span>
   acknowledge any such business arrangement/adjustments with

  the   defendant   and  refused  to  give   any  credit  to   plaintiffs  with

  respect   to   the   above   said   goods   supplied   by   plaintiff   to   the

  defendants.     The   plaintiff   under   the   said   circumstances   was

  forced and constrained to make a settlement with M/s Chandra

  Online.com   and   hence   make   a   payment   of   Rs.7   lacs   to   M/s

  Chandra   Online.com   and   also   executed   memorandum   of

  understanding   dated   24.02.2006.   Defendant   no.   2   during   the

  year 2005 upto February, 06 had several negotiations with the

  officer of the plaintiff and promised and assured the plaintiff that

  the defendants shall make the payment of outstanding dues to

  the plaintiff shortly.     The plaintiff therefore continued to have

  dealing   with   defendant   upto   the   year   2006.     However     the

  defendant failed, refused and neglected to make any payment

  of outstanding dues to the plaintiff.   On the contrary defendant

  no. 2 in conspiracy and connivance with  defendant no.3 made

  false representations and committed such illegal acts that M/s

  Chandra Online.com lodged FIR against defendant no. 2 vide

  FIR no. 30/96 PS Bunny Park, Jaipur.  Hence the present suit.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">Suit No. 348/09                                                      Page 7 of 21</span>
</p><p id="p_2"> 2.       Suit of the plaintiff has been contested by defendant no. 2

     who  besides   taking   the   preliminary   objections   interalia   on   the

     territorial jurisdiction of the court, misjoinder and non joinder of

     necessary parties, non maintainability of the present suit against

     defendant   no.   2   and   the   suit   being   not   signed,   verified   and

     instituted   by   competent   person,   on   merits,   has   denied   that

     defendant no. 1 is a partnership firm and defendants no. 2 and 3

     are the partners of the firm.   It is stated that plaintiff had came

     forward with altogether concocted story as he defendant no. 2

     never represented as alleged by the plaintiff.   It is stated that

     defendant no. 2 is employee of defendant no. 1 and working on

     behalf   of   defendant   no.   1.     Neither   defendant   no.   2   nor

     defendant no 3 was partner of defendant no. 1 at any point of

     time. It is also denied that defendant no. 2 held negotiations with

     the plaintiff for and on behalf of all the defendants.  It is stated

     that  no cause  of action has arisen in Delhi as the delivery of

     goods were taken at Jaipur office, invoice were also raised at

     Jaipur office and payments were also made at Jaipur office.  It is

     not   denied   that   defendant   no.   2   for   making   payment   with

   respect to the said supplies issue cheques under the name of

  M/s   Chandra   Online.com   plaintiff.     It   is  stated   that   there   was

  understanding   between   defendant   no.   1   and   Chandra

  Online.com and the defendant no. 2 was authorised to sign the

  chques on behalf of M/s Chandra Online.com  The amount was

  due to defendant no. 1 from M/s Chandra Online.com so M/s

  Chandra Online.com had instructed the defendant no. 2 to issue

  the   cheque   on   its   behalf   for   the   amount   due   to   M/s   Vijay

  Technologies i.e. Defendant no. 1and accordingly the cheques

  were issued to the plaintiff company by defendant no. 2 and the

  said   cheques   were   for   the   amount       which     M/s   Vijay

  Technologies   was   owing   to   the   present   plaintiff   and   this   was

  internal arrangement of all concerned.  It is denied that plaintiff

  had received  any communication  dated  05.05.2005  from   M/s

  Chandra Online.com demanding the amount.  It is stated that it

  was collusive act between plaintiff company and   M/s Chandra

  Online.com.  The receipt of notice issued by the plaintiff has not

  been denied.  It is stated that plaintiff company had concocted a

  false story simply with a view to deprive defendant no. 1 of its

   dues to the tune of more than Rs.7lacs under various schemes.

  It   is   also   denied   the     M/s   Chandra   Online.com   refused   to

  acknowledge the said business arrangement with defendant and

  also refused to give any credit to the plaintiff with respect to the

  items supplied to defendants.
</p>
<p id="p_3">       Defendants no. 1 and 3 opted not to contest the present suit.

  Though defendant no. 1 was being represented by counsel after

  the   service   of   summons   of   the   suit,   however   no   written

  statement   has   been   filed   on   behalf   of   defendant   no.   1.

  Defendant   no.   3   could   not   be   served   by   ordinary   process

  despite   best   efforts.     He   was   therefore     served   by   way   of

  publication in "Dainik Bhasker" edition dated 17.09.2009 but he

  opted not to contest.   It is pertinent to mention that no formal

  order   has   been   passed   for   proceeding   ex­parte   against

  defendants no. 1 and 3.  However, since there is no appearance

  on   behalf   of   defendant   no.   3   by   way     of   publication   and   no

  written statement has been filed on behalf of defendant no. 1

  despite repeated opportunities, they are deemed to have been

  resolution   passed   in   the   meeting   of   board   of   directors   on

  15.12.2006 in favour of Sh. Dinesh Kapoor, assistant manager

  PW1/1. Being the company secretary the Denesh Kapoor has

  power to sign and verify plaint in view of provision under 29 rule

  1   CPC   and   since   he   has   been   duly   authorized   by   resolution

  passed by board of directors to initiate the proceeding against

  the defendants, I am of the view that the suit has been  filed by

  a duly authorised person.   Issue no. 1 is decided in favour of

  plaintiff and against the defendant.

  defendant.   The   defendants   however   failed   to   adduce   any

  evidence to prove the said issue.  PW1 testified that defendant

  no. 2 had pursued the dealings for the supply at the office of the

  plaintiff company at Delhi from time to time and also accepted

  the jurisdiction of courts at Delhi. The testimony in the regard

  remained unrebuttal.  PW 2 also in his written statement in reply

  to para 4 on merits has admitted that defendants no. 2 and 3

  visited   Delhi   office   of   the   plaintiff   to   make   demand   and   for

  release of the amount in favour of defendant no. 1.   As per the

  terms and conditions printed on Tax Invoice, copy of which is

  Ex. PW1/5 and also bears the stamp of defendant no. 1, vide

  para 9 of the terms and conditions, the parties have agreed that

  the courts of Delhi alone shall have the jurisdiction to entertain

  any   dispute   between   the   parties.     In   view   of   the   unrebutted

  testimony   of   PW­1   and   terms   and   conditions   printed   on   the

  invoices duly signed and stamped on behalf of  defendant no.1,

  this   court   has   the   jurisdiction   to   try   and   entertain   the   present

  suit. Issue no.2 is decided in favour of the plaintiff and against

      the defendant.

<p id="p_18">     Finding on issue No.3

</p><p id="p_19">8.       Onus to prove the said issue had also been placed on the

     defendants.   Defendant   No.2   however   has   not   adduced   any

     evidence.   In   the   WS,   though   defendant   no.2   has   taken   the

     defence that he was working as an employee of defendant no.1,

     however he has not adduced any evidence to establish that he

     was just acting as an employee on behalf of defendant no.1. He

     has also not disclosed in his WS as to who were the partners of

     defendant   no.1   though,   admittedly   he   had   carried   out   the

     transaction   on   behalf   of   defendant   no.1.   In   view   of   the

     unrebutted testimony of PW­1 that defendant no.2 pursued the

     dealings for the supplies at the office of the plaintiff from time to

     time,   the admission  made by defendant  no.2 also in his WS

     that   he   had   been   dealing   on   behalf   of   defendant   no.1   and

     omission/failure on his part to disclose the name of the partners

     of defendant no.1, an adverse inference is drawn against him

     and   it   is   believed   that   defendant   no.2   was   dealing   with   the

     plaintiff as one of the partners of defendant no.1. Issue No.3 is

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">Suit No. 348/09                                                       Page 15 of 21</span>
      also   thus   decided   against   the   defendant   and   in   favour   of   the

     plaintiff.
</p>
<p id="p_20">     Finding on issue No.4

</p><p id="p_21">9.       The onus to prove the said issue had also been placed on

     the defendant. Defendant no.4 has taken the objection that the

     suit is bad for misjoinder and non­joinder of necessary parties

     since  defendant no.2 was only an employee  and thus no suit

     lies against him. He also took the plea that defendant no.3 has

     been unnecessarily impleaded in the array of the defendants as

     defendant   no.3   was   not   a   partner   of   defendant   no.1   but   was

     working with defendant no.1 on commission basis. In view of the

     observation   already   given   in   the   previous   issue   that   there   is

     sufficient   evidence   on   record   that   defendant   no.2   had   been

     pursuing the dealings with the plaintiff for supply of the goods on

     behalf of defendant no.1 and he also made the payment to the

     plaintiff on behalf of defendant no.1,there is sufficient evidence

     on record that defendant no.2 was one of the partners of the

     defendant  no.1.Defendant  no.2 has also not disputed that the

     cheques were issued by him from the account of M/s Chandra

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">Suit No. 348/09                                                        Page 16 of 21</span>
   Online.com in favour of the plaintiff towards the payment for the

  supply of the goods. Thus merely by stating that he was just an

  employee   of   defendant   no.1,   especially   when   he   omitted   to

  disclose   the   name   of   the   partners   of   defendant   no.1,

  preponderance   of   probability   is   that   he   is   the   partner   of

  defendant   no.1.   Regarding   defendant   no.3,   PW­2   in   his

  testimony   has   stated   that   the   purchase   order   dated   28.02.04

  was placed by Shri Ajay Hingorani to the plaintiff company for

  purchase of Ben Q mobiles which is Ex. PW­1/3. Ex. PW­1/3 is

  purported   to   have   been   signed   by   Shri   Ajay   Hingorani   for

  defendant No.1. In view of the unrebutted testimony of PW­3 in

  this   regard   and   Ex.   PW­1/2,   especially   considering   that   the

  names of partners of defendant no.1 have not been disclosed

  by defendant no.2, it is believed that defendant no.3 was also

  the partner of defendant no.1. Defendant no.2 and 3 being the

  partners of defendant no.1 are the necessary parties. In view of

  the   above   discussion,   issue   No.4   is   decided   in   favour   of   the

  plaintiff and against the defendants.

  reiterated   the   contents   of   the   plaint.   He   also   testified   that

  towards the payment of outstanding dues defendant no.2 issued

  cheques under the name of M/s Chandronline.Com representing

  that   he   is   authorised   to   issue   the   said   cheques   towards   the

  liability of defendants to the plaintiff company and the said M/s

  Chandraonline.Com vide its notice dated 05.05.05 to the plaintiff

  company demanded a sum of Rs. 5,34,927/­ alongwith interest

  towards   the   said   cheques   issued   by   defendant   no.2   and

  encashed   by   the   plaintiff   company   towards   the   liability   of

   plaintiff   had   thus   no   option   but   to   return   the   money   to   M/s

  Chandraonline.Com   which   was   paid   by   defendant   no.2   to

  plaintiff by way of cheque to clear the liability of defendant no.2.

  The   plaintiff   company   also   executed   the   memorandum   of

  understanding   dated   24.02.06   with   Mr.   Lalit   Bhoka   of   M/S

  Chandraonline.Com   which   is   Ex.   PW­1/13   and   returned   the

  money to M/s Chandraonline.Com as detailed in Ex. PW­1/13.

  The defendant despite several demands of plaintiff company to

  pay the said dues failed and neglected to make the payment of

  outstanding   dues   of   Rs.   5.03,880/­   alongwith   interest   of   Rs.

  2,05.003/­ from 29.02.04 upto 15.11.06 @ 15% per annum. PW­

  2 also corroborated the testimony of PW­1 and testified that Shri

  Amit Bhoka of M/s Chandraonline.com approached the plaintiff

  company   and   denied   that   he   had   anything   to   do   with   the

  dealings   done   by   the   defendants   with   the   plaintiff   company.

  From the memorandum of understanding dated 24.02.2006 Ex.

  PW­1/13, it is established that plaintiff had to pay Rs. 7 lacs to

  M/s Chandraonline.Com being the settled amount including the

  interest for the alleged cheque of Rs. 5,34,927.58/­ issued from

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">Suit No. 348/09                                                      Page 19 of 21</span>
   the account of M/s Chandraonline.Com in favour of the plaintiff

  towards discharge of liability of defendant no.2. The defendant

  No.2   in   his   WS   has   not   disputed     the   transaction   and   also

  admitted   that   the   cheque   was   issued   by  him  in  favour   of   the

  plaintiff under the name of M/s Chandraonline.Com. Though, it

  is stated there was understanding between defendant No.1 and

  M/s Chandraonline.com and defendant No.2 was authorised to

  sign the cheques on behalf of M/s Chandraonline.com, however,

  no evidence has been adduced on behalf of defendant in this

  regard and there is also sufficient evidence on record that the

  plaintiff   had   to   pay   Rs.   7   lacs   to   M/s   Chandra   Online.com

  through   cheque   no.   292005   dated   24.02.06   drawn   on   ICICI

  Bank   Ltd,   New  Friends   Colony,   New  Delhi  on   account   of   the

  cheque   drawn in the name of M/s Chandra Online.com by the
