<p id="p_1">          Plaintiff has filed this suit for the relief of

permanent injunction to restrain the defendants or any

persons     claiming   under           them    from     interfering,

dispossessing and taking forcible possession of suit

boundary stated in the plaint measuring 50' x 30'.


</p><p id="p_4">          3.      It is the case of the plaintiff that he is   a

member of the 1st defendant House Building Co-operative

Society and the 1st defendant had executed a sale deed

dated:16.8.1995 in respect of suit property for a valuable

consideration of Rs.12,000/- in favour of the plaintiff as

against the total payment of Rs.50,000/-.          Further, the

1st defendant had handed over the relevant documents

pertains to suit property.
</p>
<p id="p_5">     4.        It is further contended that this being the fact,

the 1st defendant Society acting prejudicial to the right

and interest of the plaintiff contrary to the direction of the

Hon'ble   High Court in Writ Petition No.6945/2009 has

illegally executed supplemental deed on 6.11.2013 in

favour of 3rd defendant by way of a registered sale deed.

Since, the plaintiff was put in exclusive possession over

suit property the 1st defendant has no right to execute

supplemental sale deed in favour of defendant No.3.

Further, the plaintiff had issued statutory notice U/s 125

of Karnataka Co-Operative Societies Act on 9.1.2014.

Even then defendant No.1 and 2 did not comply the

same. Hence, the suit came to be filed.

</p><p id="p_6">      5. Defendant No.1 and 3 even though represented

by the Counsel, did not file written statement and

contested the suit. Defendant No.2 is placed ex-parte.

</p><p id="p_7">     6.    The points that would arise for consideration

are as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">     1.         Whether the plaintiff proves his

PW.1     and      got   marked   Ex.P1   to     P18   documents.

Defendants         did not examine any witnesses and not

marked any documents.

</p><p id="p_14">                         REASONS

</p><p id="p_15">            10.   Point NO.1 to 3:            In order to avoid the

repetition of facts,         I have discussed these points

together.   Plaintiff (P.W.1) has filed the affidavit in the

form of her evidence in chief. She has reiterated the fact

stated in the plaint in the affidavit filed.               To prove the

possession over the suit property apart from the oral

evidence,   plaintiff   has     produced          certified    copy   of

registered sale deed dated: 16.8.1995 executed by

defendant No.1 Society in favour of her.                   Ex.P3 is the

memo / possession certificate dated: 7.7.19956 issued by

defendant No.1 Society.             Ex.P4 is the letter dated:

13.8.1995    issued     by    the       Society    to    the   Assistant

Executive Engineer KEB to provide electricity to the

premises situated in the suit property.                 Ex.P5 in total 2

photo snaps relates to suit property. Ex.P5(a) is the C.D.

The above said unchallenged oral and documentary

evidence is sufficient to infer the possession of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                               7        O.S.No.6002/2014</span>




plaintiff over the suit property.
</p>
<p id="p_16">     11.     Ex.P1 is two in numbers i.e., receipt dated:

4.7.1995 for having remitted a sum of Rs.30,000/-

towards site deposit, and     the receipt for having paid a

sum of Rs.20,000/- through cheque towards development

charges.    Ex.P8 is the demand notice dated: 16.8.2011

to pay a sum of Rs.2,79,900/- issued by defendant No.1

Society.    Ex.P10 is the acknowledgement issued by

defendant No.1 Society dated: 22.9.2011 for having

received the said amount of Rs.2,79,900/-.      The above

said documents supports the case of the plaintiff to prove

her prima-facie title.
</p>
<p id="p_17">     12.    It is the contention of the learned counsel for

the plaintiff that defendant No.1 Society without having

any right had executed a supplemental deed dated:

16.11.2013 in favour of 3rd defendant          by   way   of

registered sale deed without examining the seniority

which is contrary to the direction of the    Hon'ble   High
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                             8           O.S.No.6002/2014</span>




Court of Karnataka in W.P.No.6945/2009.        Further, by

virtue of the sale deed, plaintiff has become the owner in

possession over the suit property. It is further contended

by the learned counsel for the plaintiff in the written

argument that contrary to the direction of the Hon'ble

High Court, defendant No.1 Society has sold the suit

property.   Ex.P12 is the certified copy of the sale deed

stands in the name of defendant No.3.        Ex.P13 is the

supplemental deed. As contended by the learned counsel

for the plaintiff, the sale deed executed in favour of

plaintiff has not yet been cancelled.   I feel, by virtue of

the sale deed the plaintiff was put in possession over the

suit property. Since, the earlier sale deed has not been

cancelled, 1st defendant Society has no authority to keep

defendant No.3 in possession over the suit property.

However, the defendants did not challenge the oral and

documentary evidence.    The order passed by the Hon'ble

High Court in No.18496/2007 vide Ex.P18 connected with
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                9          O.S.No.6002/2014</span>




other cases dated: 16.11.2010 binds to the parties.

</p><p id="p_18">      13.       On perusal of the certified copy of sale deed

dated:      28.3.1994    and   supplemental       deed      dated:

16.11.2013, it appears that the documents relate to the

suit property.     The Hon'ble High Court has ordered that

the   Society    shall   prepare   seniority   list   of   genuine

members who are eligible for allotment of site. Further,

the persons who are eligible for allotment of site

according to seniority list and the allotment and sale

deeds had already been executed in their favour, such

sale deeds shall be confirmed by the 1st defendant

Society, if there is no dispute regarding seniority in the

matter of allotment of sites.       In the case in hand, the

defendants did not challenge the oral and documentary

evidence.     These documents are sufficient to infer the

possession of the plaintiff over the suit property.

</p><p id="p_19">      14.       According to P.W.1, the 2nd defendant had

issued notice to him on 30.5.2014 vide Ex.P16 to submit
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                   10          O.S.No.6002/2014</span>




his explanation within 30 days as to why he should not be

dispossessed from the suit property. Ex.P17 is the reply

dated:       11.6.2014    given    by   the    plaintiff.   The

apprehension of the plaintiff is that defendants are trying

to dispossess him. This fact has not been challenged by

the defendants.          Hence, I feel the defendants have no

right to dispossess the plaintiff without due process of

law.   Therefore, I answer point No1 to 3 in affirmative.

</p><p id="p_20">       15.     Point No.4:        Even though, defendant No.1

and 3 are represented by the counsel, they did not

contest the suit. Hence, plaintiff is entitled for the cost of

the suit.       In view of the discussion made above, I

proceed to pass the following:
