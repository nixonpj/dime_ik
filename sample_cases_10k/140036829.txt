ORAL JUDGMENT

Date: 15-05-2017
 Patna High Court LPA No.192 of 2017 dt.15-05-2017

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                          2/3</span>




                         Seeking exception to an order dated 04.10.2016 passed

        by the learned Writ Court in Civil Writ Jurisdiction Case No.2230 of

        2016, this appeal has been filed under Clause 10 of the Letters

        Patent.
</p>
<p id="p_11">                          Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences issued a

        tender notice on 28.05.2015 for installation of Laparoscopic Surgery

        Set with all Standard Accessories. The tender was processed and the

        contract was awarded to M/s Vishal Surgical Equipment Company

        Pvt. Ltd.. Challenging the grant made, the writ petition was filed by

        the appellant and before the Writ Court, as is made out from the

        detailed order passed by the learned Writ Court, four objections

        were raised. The objections were examined in detail by the learned

        Writ Court and it was found that they were not substantial in nature

        and they were primarily inadvertent errors, which were clarified at

        the time of negotiation and finding that the tender has been awarded

        in accordance with law, the writ petition has been dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_12">                         The same arguments, as were canvassed before the

        learned Writ Court, were put forth before us and after hearing

        learned counsel for the parties, we find that in a detailed order

        passed, the learned Writ Court has gone into each of the four issues

        raised and indicated them by giving cogent and justifiable reasons.
</p>
<p id="p_13">        We see no reasons to take a different view. As the learned Writ
           Patna High Court LPA No.192 of 2017 dt.15-05-2017

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                                    3/3</span>




                  Court has dealt with issues and given reasonable justifications for

                  dismissing the writ petition and finding no error in the order passed

                  by the learned Writ Court, this appeal is also dismissed.
