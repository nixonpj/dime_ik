               HIGH COURT OF MADHA PRADESH
                     NATIONAL LOK ADALAT
                        Con.C. No.743/2017
Indore, Dated: 10/02/2018
      Shri S.L. Soni, learned counsel for petitioner.
      None for the respondents.</pre>
<p id="p_1">      In the present case, the petitioner is aggrieved by the non
compliance of the order dated 21/3/2017 passed by this court in
WP No.838/2016 and WP No.3262/2016 whereby this court had
made the following observations:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">             "This Court is of the opinion that respondents
      cannot be permitted to discriminate between the
      employees, who have joined their services in M.P.
      Paschim Kshetra Vidyut Vitran Co. Ltd as all the
      employees, who have been transferred and absorbed
      in the services of M.P. Paschim Kshetra Vidyut Vitran
      Co. Ltd form one class only and cannot be
      discriminated within the class, therefore, all such
      employees of M.P. Paschim Kshetra Vidyut Vitran Co.
      Ltd will be entitled to continue up to the age of 60
      years. Resultantly, the petitioner shall be entitled to
      continue up to the age of 60 years and the impugned
      order is quashed.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">             The petitioner has already been superannuated
      by the respondents, she shall also be entitled for
      consequential benefits by treating her in service up to
      the age of 60 years including 50% of the back wages.
      The other writ petition is also allowed with similar
      directions."</blockquote>

<p id="p_2">      Against the aforesaid order, writ appeal was also preferred
but the same has also been dismissed, however, till date the order
passed by this Court on 21/3/2017 has not been complied with.
</p><p id="p_3">      In view of this, the present contempt petition is disposed of
with direction to the respondents to comply with the aforesaid
order within a period of three months from the date of receipt of
certified copy of this order. It is made clear that if the order passed
by this court in WP No.3262/2016 is not complied with by the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1"> 2</span>



respondents within the time granted by this court, and if the
petitioner    is compelled to file contempt petition again, then the
petitioner is entitled for costs of both contempt petitions and the
same can be recoverable from the concerned authority.</p><pre id="pre_2">
