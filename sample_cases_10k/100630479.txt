             WRIT PETITION No.1960 OF 2007

ORDER:
</pre>
<p id="p_1">     This writ petition is filed to issue a Writ of Certiorari

calling for the records pertaining to G.O.Ms.No.3 Social

Welfare (LTR1) Department dated 24.01.2007, wherein the

Agent   to   Government   by   order   dated   31.01.2005   in

S.R.A.No.4 of 2002, confirmed the order of the Special Deputy

Collector, Tribal Welfare, K.R.Puram, West Godavari District

in S.R.No.6 of 2001 dated 04.05.2001, whereby and wherein

the authorities under the provisions of Andhra Pradesh

Scheduled Areas Land Transfer Regulation, 1959 (for short

'Regulation 1 of 1959) as amended by Regulation 1 of 1970

passed decree of ejectment of the petitioner from the lands,

and quash the same as illegal, arbitrary and contrary to the

provisions of the Regulation 1 of 1959 as amended by

Regulation 1 of 1970.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">2.   The brief facts of the case are that the petitioner is in

possession and enjoyment of the land to an extent of Ac.0.36

cents in R.S.No.189/1, Ac.4.29 cents in R.S.No.189/4 and

Ac.2.74 cents in R.S.No.205/3 - total an extent of Ac.7.39

cents of Ganapavaram Village, Buttaigudem Mandal, West

Godavari District. The lands are situated in an agency area of

Buttaigudem. The Special Deputy Tahsildar, Tribal Welfare,

K.R.Puram filed a complaint against the petitioner's father

and his family members in S.R.No.6 of 2001 under <a href="/doc/216578/" id="a_1">Section
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                  2</span></a>



<a href="/doc/379553/" id="a_2">3(2)(a)</a> of the Regulation 1 of 1959 as amended by Regulation

1 of 1970 in respect of the lands covered in R.S.No.214/1,

224/1, 224/2, 189/1, 205/3 and 189/4. The transfer of the

lands are hit by <a href="/doc/379553/" id="a_3">Section 3(1)(a)</a> of the Regulation 1 of 1959 as

amended by Regulation 1 of 1970.            The Special Deputy

Collector (Tribal Welfare), Kota Ramachandrapuram held that

Smt. Mallabathula Somalamma appeared before him and

deposed that she is resident of Patennapalem Village and the

scheduled land to an extent of Ac.0.36 cents in R.S.No.189/1,

Ac.4.29   cents   in   R.S.No.189/4   and    Ac.2.74   cents   in

R.S.No.205/3      -    total   measuring    Ac.7.39    cents   of

Ganapavaram Village of Buttaigudem Mandal was purchased

by her father namely Konathala Suraiah from Sri Bandaru

Suraiah and others through registered a sale deed vide

Document No.197/1978 dated 20.04.1978. She received the

said property from her father on succession and she is in

enjoyment of the same. Since the scheduled mentioned land

was purchased in the year 1978 i.e. after the Regulation 1 of

1970 came into force, he passed ejectment orders as the

petitioner has been in possession and enjoyment of the

scheduled property in contravention of the provisions of

<a href="/doc/379553/" id="a_4">Section 3(1)(a)</a> of the Regulation 1 of 1959 as amended by

Regulation 1 of 1970. Being aggrieved by the orders of the

Special Deputy Collector, the petitioner preferred an appeal

before the Agent to Government, West Godavari District,

Eluru in S.R.A.No.4 of 2004 and the Agent to Government,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                 3</span>



West Godavari District in his order dated 31.01.2005,

dismissed the appeal and confirmed the orders of the Special

Deputy Collector (Tribal Welfare), Kota Ramachandrapuram.

During the hearing of the appeal, the petitioner filed a

registered Will No.30 of BK 3/2002 dated 11.04.2002, by

which it is revealed that the property acquired by the creator

of the Will - Kanathala Suraiah by virtue of the Gift deed

No.1102 of 1978 dated 21.09.1978 registered in the Office of

Sub-Registrar,     Jangareddygudem        and   taking     into

consideration of the said Will, the appeal was dismissed.

Against which, the petitioner preferred a revision under

<a href="/doc/1463767/" id="a_5">Section 6</a> of the Regulation 1 of 1959 against the orders of the

Agent to Government, West Godavari District in S.R.A.No.4 of

2002 dated 31.01.2005.         The Government rejected the

revision   holding that the Will deed bearing No.30 of

BK3/2002 dated 11.04.2002 is generated from registered Gift

deed No.1102, dated 21.09.1978, which is hit by the

provisions of the Regulation 1 of 1959 as amended by

Regulation 1 of 1970.       Against which, the present writ

petition came to be filed before this Court.


</p><p id="p_4">3.   Sri P.R.K. Amarendra Kumar, learned counsel for the

petitioner, would contend that the petitioner has been in

possession and enjoyment of the land to an extent of Ac.0.36

cents in R.S.No.189/1, Ac.4.29 cents in R.S.No.189/4 and

Ac.2.74 cents in R.S.No.205/3 - total an extent of Ac.7.39

cents of Ganapavaram Village, Buttaigudem Mandal, West
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                  4</span>



Godavari District.    Originally, the subject land along with

other lands acquired by the petitioner's father late Sri

Konathala Suraiah and his family members prior to the

commencement of the Land Transfer Regulation 1 of 1959 as

amended by Regulation 1 of 1970. This land was allotted in

favour of the petitioner's father during the family partition

among the family members.               Subsequently, her father

insisted to execute a document to facilitate him to raise the

loans, other facilities and subsidies which are being extended

by the Government.        Accordingly, his family members

executed a family settlement deed in the year 1978.             The

petitioner being the only daughter succeeded to the property

of her father Konathala Suraiah. As the lands are situated in

agency area of Buttaiguidem, the Special Deputy Tahsildar,

Tribal   Welfare,    K.R.Puram       filed   a   complaint   against

petitioner's father and his family members in S.R.No.6 of

2001 under <a href="/doc/379553/" id="a_6">Section 3(2)(a)</a> of the Regulation 1 of 1959 as

amended by Regulation 1 of 1970 in respect of the lands

covered in R.S.No.214/1, 224/1, 224/2, 189/1, 205/3 and

189/4, stating that the petitioner's possession is hit by the

provisions of <a href="/doc/379553/" id="a_7">Section 3(1)(a)</a> of the Regulation 1 of 1959 as

amended by Regulation 1 of 1970. As per <a href="/doc/379553/" id="a_8">Section 3(1)(a)</a> of

the Regulation 1 of 1959 as amended by Regulation 1 of

1970, any transfer of immovable property situated in agency

tracts by a person whether or not such person is a member of

scheduled tribe, shall be absolutely null and void.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                 5</span>



</p><p id="p_5">      The   learned   counsel   further   contended   that   the

authorities under the Act erroneously came to a conclusion

without looking into the recitals of the deed executed in the

year 1978. The original authority says that it is a gift deed

and the appellate authority says that it is a sale deed and the

revisional authority confirmed the same and rejected the

revision, which is contrary to the provisions of the Regulation

1 of 1959 as amended by the Regulation 1 of 1970 when the

recitals of deed states that it is a settlement deed executed

confirming the oral earlier settlements made prior to the

amended Regulation 1 of 1970 and the transfer took place

among the family members prior to the coming into force of

Regulation 1 of 1970 and it is a transaction between the non-

tribals.    The petitioner's father is in possession and

enjoyment of the same by an oral settlement. Subsequently,

the other family members settled the property in favour of the

petitioner's father in the year 1978 by a registered deed which

comes within the meaning of 'testamentary disposition' and

excludes from the meaning of 'transfer' as enumerated in

<a href="/doc/216578/" id="a_9">Section 2(g)</a> of the Regulation 1 of 1959 as amended by the

Regulation 1 of 1970.
</p>
<p id="p_6">
</p><p id="p_7">      Further, the learned counsel by way of reply affidavit to

the counter-affidavit along with certified copy of Document

No.1102 of 1978, states that the deed of immovable property

executed in favour of Konatala Suraiah by the other family

members as he is a niece of the executants. The property was
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                    6</span>



already given to the mother of Konatala Suraiah i.e.

Durgamma towards Pasupukumkuma and the same was

handed over to the mother of Konatala Suraiah and after her

demise, the petitioner's father came into possession and

enjoyment.       Thereafter, the petitioner succeeded to the

property by Will deed,


      Further,    the    learned       counsel    for    the    petitioner

emphatically contended that by any stretch of imagination,

the recitals of the Document No.1102 of 1978, could not be

said to be sale deed or gift deed executed in contravention of

the provisions of <a href="/doc/379553/" id="a_10">Section 3(1)(a)</a> of Regulation 1 of 1959 as

amended by Regulation 1 of 1970 as the lands were settled

long back as a Pasupukumkuma to the petitioner's mother

Durgamma and thereafter, the petitioner's father succeeded

to the property to enjoy the property and the family members

of the petitioner's grandmother executed a settlement deed in

the   year   1978   confirming         the   earlier    possession    and

enjoyment of the land by the petitioner's father much prior to

the coming into force of Regulation 1 of 1970.                 Hence, the

transactions are not hit by <a href="/doc/379553/" id="a_11">Section 3(1)</a> of Regulation 1 of

1959 as amended by Regulation 1 of 1970.                  The amended

Regulation 1 of 1970 prohibiting the transfer even between

the non-tribals was come into force with effect from

03.02.1970.      Hence, the ejectment orders passed by the

original authority - Deputy Collector (Tribal Welfare) holding

that the transfer effected in the year 1978 is a sale deed,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                   7</span>



contrary to the provisions of <a href="/doc/379553/" id="a_12">Section 3(1)</a> of the Regulation 1

of 1959 as amended by Regulation 1 of 1970 and the

appellate authority has rejected the appeal on the ground that

the transfer deed executed in the year 1978 is a gift deed, out

of which Will deed was arisen in favour of the petitioner, is

contrary to the recitals of the transfer deed executed in the

year 1978. The revisional authority under <a href="/doc/84142018/" id="a_13">Section 6</a> of the

Regulations, without adverting to the grounds of revision,

merely confirmed the finding of the original and appellate

authorities and rejected the revision.        Hence, the revision

confirming the appellate authority's order and original

authority's order is illegal and contrary to the evidence

available on record and it is based on an erroneous

appreciation of fact and law.         Hence, it is liable to be set

aside.
</p>
<p id="p_8">
</p><p id="p_9">4.       Per contra, the learned Government Pleader, while

reiterating the averments of the counter and order of the

original, appellate and revisional authorities, would contend

that the proceedings made in respect of the schedule lands

through a registered Document No.197 of 1978 dated

21.09.1978 are hit by the provisions of <a href="/doc/379553/" id="a_14">Section 3(1)</a> of the

Regulation 1 of 1959 as amended by Regulation 1 of 1970 as

the settlement deed dated 21.09.1978 has been effected after

commencement of Regulation 1 of 1970 and the possession

was      not   established   by   the   petitioner   prior   to   the

commencement of the Regulation 1 of 1970. Hence, there is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                8</span>



no illegality or irregularity in passing the ejectment order by

the original authority as confirmed by the appellate and

revisional authorities. Hence, the writ petition is liable to be

dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_10">
</p><p id="p_11">5.    In the facts and circumstances of the case and in

considered view of this Court, this Court finds that the

petitioner is in possession and enjoyment of the agricultural

land to an extent of Ac.0.36 cents in R.S.No.189/1, Ac.4.29

cents in R.S.No.189/4 and Ac.2.74 cents in R.S.No.205/3 -

total measuring Ac.7.39 cents of Ganapavaram Village of

Buttaigudem Mandal, situated in an agency area. Originally,

the schedule land was acquired by Sri Bandaru Venkayya

during his lifetime prior to commencement of Land Transfer

Regulations along with other lands.       The said Venkayya

having one daughter and one son viz., Bandaru Somaiah and

Bandaru (Konathala) Durgamma.           The said Durgamma

married to one Konathala Gangaiah.          As per the family

settlement, possession of the suit schedule land was given to

Durgamma. The said Durgamma has only one son by name

Konathala Suraiah. The petitioner being the only daughter of

Konathala Suraiah, succeeded to the property through a Will

deed after his demise.
</p>
<p id="p_12">
</p><p id="p_13">6.   As the lands are situated in an agency area i.e.

Ganapavaram Village of Buttaigudem Mandal, the Special

Deputy Tahsildar, Tribal Welfare, K.R.Puram filed a complaint
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                   9</span>



before the Special Deputy Collector (Tribal Welfare) in

S.R.No.6 of 2001.     The Special Deputy Collector conducted

enquiry and passed the decree of ejectment in respect of the

schedule lands, stating that the petitioner's father Konathala

Suraiah purchased the lands in the year 1978 through

Document No.197/1978 dated 21.09.1978 after Regulation 1

of 1970 came into force and thereby the subsequent

proceedings and settlements were also hit by the provisions of

<a href="/doc/379553/" id="a_15">Section 3(1)</a> of the Regulation 1 of 1959 as amended by

Regulation 1 of 1970, which is contrary to the recitals of the

Settlement deed. The original authority stated that the said

document is a sale deed, whereas the appellate authority

stated that it is a gift deed. The Government, basing on the

said finding of the lower and appellate authorities, has

rejected   the   revision    without   properly   considering   the

evidence on record.         All the authorities have come to a

different conclusion on the recitals of the documents as

stated supra, without properly looking into documents placed

before them.

R.S.No.224/1 and Ac.2.64 cents in R.S.No.224/2 - in total

Ac.15.59 cents, whereas the land to an extent of Ac.4.29

Ac.0.36 cents in Ac.189/1 - in total Ac.7.39 cents in respect
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                               10</span>



of the claim of the petitioner was allowed.      The original

authority, without properly considering the evidence on

record including recitals of Document No.197/1978 dated

21.09.1978, came to the conclusion that it is a gift deed and

the appellate authority came to a different conclusion that it

is a sale deed and the recitals of the Document No.1102 of

1978 dated 21.09.1978 executed in respect of the petitioner's

lands, was not properly considered in its proper perspective,

and thereby the authorities committed an error of fact and

law.
</p>
<p id="p_16">
</p><p id="p_17">8.     The appellate authority, while dealing with Document

No.1102 of 1978 dated 21.09.1978, held that it is a gift deed.

The lands, in respect of which transfer was said to have been

made by a sale deed and gift deed of the year 1978 pertaining

to other lands, were misapplied to petitioner's lands and held

that transfers are hit by <a href="/doc/379553/" id="a_16">Section 3(1)</a> of the Regulation 1 of

1959 as amended by Regulation 1 of 1970. The authorities

have not properly considered the said documents and the

documents were executed confirming the earlier family

settlements made in favour of petitioner's father by name

Konathala Suraiah and subsequent documents of the year

1978 were executed only to facilitate the land holders who are

in possession of the lands to enable them to get the benefits

of subsidies, loans, etc., extended by the Government and

other agencies.   The authorities were fallen into error by

passing the impugned orders without properly appreciating
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                11</span>



the evidence available on record. Further, the contentions of

the learned Government Pleader are contra to the above facts

and   they   are   untenable   and     thereby   do   not   merit

consideration by this Court. This Court felt that the findings

of all the authorities are perverse and not based on any

reasonable conclusion.
</p>
<p id="p_18">
</p><p id="p_19">9.    Further, this Court finds that there is a grave error of

fact and law in deciding the issue by the lower authority.

Hence, in the interest of Justice, the matter is remanded back

the impugned orders passed by the original, appellate and
