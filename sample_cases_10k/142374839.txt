  apart   from   fine   of   Rs.1000/­   I/D   2   months   SI   for   commissionof

  offence punishable U/s 411 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_2">IPC</a>.

2. I have heard Ld. Counsel Ms. Kamini Srivastava for appellant /


  convict and Ld. Addl. PP Sh. G.S.Guraya for State  . I have also


  carefully perused the entire appeal file as well as TCR.

3.  Facts</pre><p id="p_1"> of this case in brief necessary for disposal of this appeal  are

  that   on   20.4.1998   DD   No.   11A   was   received   qua   theft   .     SI

                                                              th
  Ravinder Kumar reach Office of Sr.Addl. CP 5  Floor , PHQ , MSO

  Building, ITO, Delhi.  Ct. Girish Chand gave a statement Ex.PW1/A

  to the effect that he is Orderly of Sr. Addl. CP Sh. Ajay Aggarwal.

  He  opens   and   closes   the   office   personally   and   deposits   the   key

  with guardroom.   On 17.4.98   the office was closed and the key

  was deposited with guardroom.  Next two days 18.4.98 and 19.4.98

  were Saturday and Saunday and as such office remained close .

  He opened  the  office  on  20.4.98  at 9.00am.    While cleaning  the

  room he found that   BPL brand VCR and its remote were missing

  from underneath the TV.    He reported the matter to PA Sh. Hukum

  Chand.     On   this   statement   FIR   U/s   380   <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_3">IPC</a>   was   registered.

  Investigation was carried on  during which site plan was prepared,

  crime team was also summoned at the spot and finger prints were

  lifted.   Vide DD No.4A one Juvenile Pradeep Kumar disclosed that

  he committed  theft of VCR and a fax machine from PHQ.    He was

  roped into the case in hand as well.  Vide his disclosure statement

  Ex.PW3/A   and   Ex.PW3/C,   he   got   recovered   stolen   VCR   of   this

  case from the house of convict / appellant Dinesh Kumar apart from

  other   recovery.     Convict   was   arrested   in   this   matter   and   charge

  sheet was prepared U/s 380/411 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_4">IPC</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_2">4. Accused  was summoned  and charged  for commission  of offence

  punishable U/s 411 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_5">IPC</a>.   To prove its case prosecution examined

  10 witnesses.  Statement of accused U/s 313 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_6">Cr.P.C</a>. was recorded

  followed by hearing of both the sides and pass over of impugned

  judgment of conviction and sentence.
</p>
<p id="p_3">5. While opening her arguments,  firstly it is stated by Ld. Counsel for

  the convict / appellant is that the sole stolen property in this matter



                                         Page No.3 of  Appeal Dinesh Kumar Vs. State of  5 pages
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                           4</span>

  i.e. BPL Sanyo VCR but neither in the FIR nor in the seizure memo

  any   particular   of   it     like   model   no.   or   instrument     no.   stands

  mentioned.   Also no bill qua purchase of the said VCR was seized

  or   proved   in   the   Court.     The   record   also   reveals   that   no   Test

  Identification   Parade   of   the   VCR   was   got   conducted   after   its

  claimed seizure.  Even the seizure memo of the same was not duly

  proved on record in so far as only an incomplete   photocopy was

  exhibited as PW3/A   since it does not contain any date .   Even if

  submission of Ld. Addl. PP is believed that property is identified in

  the court, it does not absolve the prosecution of the duty to connect

  the   same   with   the   stolen   VCR   during   the   investigation.     It   is   a

  settled  legal proposition  that  identification  for the  first time in the

  court has no value in the eyes of law . 
</p>
<p id="p_4">6. In case titled   State Vs. V.C. Shukla A 1980 SC 1382 it has been


  observed by Hon'ble Supreme Court that:

<p id="p_5">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">                         "Identification   for   the   first   time   in   court
                         without being tested  by a prior identification
                         parade is valueless."

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">7.  In this backdrop I have no hesitation in concluding that prosecution

  has   totally   failed   to   connect     claimed   recovered   VCR   with   the

  convict / appellant .    This anamoly in the prosecution story goes to

  the   root   of   the   matter.   Once   the   recovery   has   come   under   the

  serious   cloud,   no   conviction   under   <a href="/doc/812083/" id="a_7">Section   411</a>   IPC   can   be

  sustained.   The impugned judgment and order on sentence dated

  24/6/2011 and 25/6/2011 respectively, too  can not be sustained in

  law.       Same   are   accordingly   set   aside,   appellant   /   convict   is

  acquitted,   his   bail   bond   be   deemed   canceled,   surety   deemed

  discharged   after   appeal   period.   Appeal   file   be   consigned   to   RR.
