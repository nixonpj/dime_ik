ORAL
ORDER</pre> 

 

 


 

<p id="p_1">1.		This
Civil Revision Application is directed against the judgment and
decree dated 12th May, 2008 passed by the learned
Appellate Bench of Small Causes Court, at Ahmedabad in Civil Appeal
No.48 of 1998, whereby the said appeal was dismissed.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_2">2.0.		The
short facts of the case are :
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_3">2.1.		The
respondents herein are the legal heirs of deceased Ramanlal Chhotalal
Khambhatwala-original plaintiff-landlord. The respondents had
preferred a suit being HRP Suit No, 4227 of 1987 in Small Causes
Court,  Ahmedabad against the applicants, on the ground that they are
the tenants in arrears of rent.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_4">2.2.		The
learned trial Court after hearing the parties and after considering
the evidence on record, decreed the suit in favour of the
respondents-original plaintiff.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_5">2.3.		Against
the said order, the applicants had preferred appeal being Civil
Appeal NO. 48 of 1998, before the appellate Bench of the Small Causes
Court, Ahmedabad. The learned appellate Court, after hearing the
parties and after considering the evidence on record, dismissed the
said appeal. Hence, this Civil Revision Application.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_6">3.0.		The
learned counsel for the applicants has contended that both the Courts
below have not taken into consideration the fact that the
respondent-original plaintiff had failed to establish that the
exclusive possession of the rented premises have been transferred to
some other person and that the burden would shift on the tenant to
show as to how a particular person is in possession of the rented
premises. In support of his contention, he has placed reliance on the
decision of this Court rendered in the case of Dr. Popatlal
Premchand Sheth (Since Decd.) Through his heirs <a href="/doc/984172/" id="a_1">Dinesh Popatlal Sheth
&amp; Ors. v. M/s. Dhanjibhai &amp; Sons</a> reported in 1994(1)GLR
pg.71, wherein the Court has
held that if the conclusions are reached by the lower Courts on
misapplication of law, the same can be corrected by this Court in
Revision. The learned counsel for the applicants has further relied
upon the decision of this Court in the case of <a href="/doc/1446881/" id="a_2">Popatlal
Vadilal Bhansali &amp; Ors. v. Kasturbhai Ranchhodbhai Soni &amp;
Ors</a>. reported in 2003(3)GLR pg.2595,
wherein the Court has held that when the findings are perverse and
substantial, injustice is likely to be caused, the High Court could
interfere in exercise of revisional jurisdiction.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_7">4.0.		Heard learned counsel
for the applicants. On perusal of the record, it transpires that
respondents-original plaintiff have proved beyond doubt that the
applicants had transferred the suit premises  and had committed
breach of the terms of tenancy. The said fact is established from the
Rent Note at Exh.43.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_8">5.0		Considering the facts
of the case, in my opinion, both the Courts below were completely
justified in passing the impugned judgment. I am in complete
agreement with the concurrent findings recorded by both the Courts
below and hence, find no reason to interfere in this application and
hence, the decisions relied on by the learned counsel for the
applicants shall not apply to the case on hand.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_9">6.0.		The Civil Revision
Application, therefore is dismissed.
</p>
