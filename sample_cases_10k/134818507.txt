                      to 07.06.1964 and to make necessary entry in his Service Register and

                      consequently direct the second respondent to issue an order permitting the

                      on record.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                                              3</span>

</p><p id="p_7">                            4. On Perusal of the records, prima facie I am of the view that the writ

                      petition is not maintainable due to laches. Admittedly, the petitioner had

                      earlier approached the second respondent within a period of 5 years from the

                      date of entry into service for change of date of birth in his service register, but

                      the same was rejected by the second respondent on 14.12.2005. However, the

                      above order is not challenged so far. It appears that after five years from the

                      date of entry into service, the petitioner submitted another application for

                      correcting his date of birth. As per law any corrections in the date of birth is

                      to be made within 5 years from the date of entry into the service. Therefore,

                      the petitioner now cannot insist the respondents to change the date of birth

                      based on his second application, which has been filed after 5 years.




</p><p id="p_8">                            5. Since the earlier application filed within a period of five years was

                      rejected in the year 2005 and the the same has not been challenged all these

                      years, and the second application has also been made after 14 years, the

                      present Writ Petition seeking for disposal of the said representation is liable to

                      be dismissed, in view of the laches and delay. Admittedly, the petitioner is

                      retiring from his service in this month and in the last day of his retirement, the

                      petitioner has come before this Court, which clearly indicates that the Writ

                      Petitioner is only attempting to get the benefits of extension of service.

</p><p id="p_9">                            6. For all the above reasons, I am of the view that the writ petition is

                      liable to be dismissed. Accordingly, the writ petition is dismissed. No costs.
