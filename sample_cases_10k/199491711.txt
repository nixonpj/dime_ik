 1        As   the   factual   controversy   in   these   petitions 
 is   admittedly   more   or   less   identical,   these

 petitions can be disposed of by a common Judgment. 
 For   the   sake   of   convenience,   we   are   making   a 
 detailed reference  to the facts of the case in Writ 
 Petition   No.2433   of   1990.     In   fact,   the   main 
 submissions   have   been   canvassed   in   the   said   Writ 
 Petition.  
</p>

<p id="p_2"> 2    The petitioners in the Writ Petition No.2433 of 
 1990   were   at   the   relevant   time   manufacturers   of 
 colour   televisions   and   other   electrical   items.     At 
 the   relevant   time,   the   petitioners   were   importing 
 Video Tape Deck Mechanism (VTDM) and Colour Picture 
 Tubes   (CPTs)   as   electronic   items   against   the 
 additional   licences   issued   pursuant   to   Import   and 
 Export   policy   88-91   (for   short   `the   said   policy'). 
 Under the said policy, export houses/trading houses 
 were eligible for additional licences for the period 
 for   which   the   export   house/trading   house 
 certificates are valid.   It was provided that items 
 permissible   will   be   those   allowed   under   the   policy 
 on the date of issue of licences.   At the relevant 
 time,   VDTMs   and   CPTs   were   listed   as   Open   General 
 Licence (for short "OGL) items. VDTMs were at Serial 
 no.821(79)   and   CPTs   were   at   Serial   no.821(5)   of 
 Appendix-6, List-8 Part-1 forming a part of the said 
 policy. There is no dispute about the fact that both 
 the items were listed as OGL items at the relevant 
 time.  Between the period from 2nd August 1988 to 10th 
 March   1989,     the   petitioners   purchased   additional 
 licences which were of the dates prior to 21st March 
 1989.   The licences were endorsed under clause 215 
 of the said policy.

 3        According   to   the   case   of   the   petitioners, 
</pre><p id="p_3"> between 2nd February 1990 to 26 th February 1990, they 
 opened   Letters   of   Credit   in   favour   of   the   foreign 
 suppliers for the import of said two categories of 
 goods.     All   imports   were   made   prior   to   31st  March 
 1990.  Between 1st November 1989 to 11th October 1990, 
 the   petitioners   filed   Bills   of   Entry   with   Sea 
 Customs   and   Air   Customs   against   the   imports   made 
 from   time   to   time   of   the   said   goods.   It   is   their 
 case   that   similar   goods   were   cleared   earlier. 
 However,   the   Customs   raised   an   objection   to   the 
 validity of the additional licences.  Therefore, the 
 goods were allowed to be bonded and where goods were 
 meant for export, re-export was allowed against bond 
 with bank guarantee.   However, the goods which were 
 meant   for   home   clearance   were   not   allowed   to   be 
 cleared in view of ITC public  public notice No.109 
 of   1989   issued   on   21 st  March   1989.     By   the   said 
 public notice, CPTs were deleted from Sr. No.821(5) 
 and shifted to Entry No.129 of Appendix 2-B. By the 
 said public notice, even VTDMs were deleted from 821 
 (79) and were shifted to Entry No.138A in Appendix 
 2B. Both the categories of goods were shifted by the 
 public   notice   to   the   list   of   restricted   items   for 
 import.   As   the   clearance   of   the   goods   was   not 
 allowed, the petitioners filed the present petition. 
 Writ   Petitions   in   this   group   were   admitted   by 
 granting   interim   relief   in   terms   of   prayer   clause 
</p><p id="p_4"> (b) by which the respondents were directed to allow 
 the   petitioners   to   clear   the   goods   against 
 additional   licences   the   copies   of   which   have   been

 annexed   as   Exhibit   A   and   B   to   the   petitions   on 
 petitioners   executing   ITC   Bond   in   favour   of   the 
 respondents.   A   liberty   was   granted   by   the   said 
 interim   order   dated   10th  September   1990   to   the 
 respondents   to   adjudicate   after   following   the 
 principles   of   natural   justice.     Accordingly,   an 
 Order in Original was passed by the Commissioner of 
 Customs(C) in respect of the Bills of Entry subject 
 matter of some of the petitions. By the said Order 
 in   Original,   the   Commissioner   of   Customs   ordered 
 confiscation of goods by holding that imports under 
 the  additional licences were invalid in view of the 
 public   notice   No.109/89   dated   21st  March   1989   (for 
 short "the said public notice").   Against the Order 
 in   Original   dated   30th  April   1992,   the   petitioners 
 preferred   a   statutory   appeal   before   the   Customs, 
 Excise and Gold Control Appellate Tribunal at Mumbai 
 (for   short   "the   Appellate   Tribunal").     By   order 
 dated   10th  November   1997,   the   Appellate   Tribunal 
 disposed of the appeal on the ground that this Court 
 was   seized   of   the   matter.     By   carrying   out 
 amendment,   the   Order   in   Original   dated   30th  April 
 1992 was permitted to be challenged and accordingly, 
 additional   grounds   were   added   and   prayer   (aa)   was 
 added   for   incorporating   a   challenge   to   the   order 
 Dated 30th April 1992.  Only other substantive relief 
 claimed in this petition is prayer (a) enjoining the 
 respondents to allow clearance of the goods imported 
 by   the   petitioners   against   the   additional   licences 
 the copies of which have been annexed as Exhibits A 
 and B to the petition.

 4        There is a reply dated 6th January 2003 filed by 
</pre><p id="p_5"> Shri   Bachan   Singh,   Assistant   Commissioner   of 
 Customs, Group VB, Mumbai.   In the reply, reliance 
 was   placed   on   the   said   public   notice   by   which   the 
 category   of   goods   subject   matter   of   the   Writ 
 Petition was transferred from the list of OGL items 
 to the list of restricted items.   It was contended 
 that   the   imports   in   question   were   made   by   the 
 petitioners after the date of the said public notice 
 and therefore, they were not entitled to import the 
 goods   under   the   additional   licences.   It   was 
 contended   that   the   validity   of   the   additional 
 licences was limited to the items which are placed 
 under   the   OGL.     A   submission   was   made   that   the 
 import   policy   prevailing   at   the   time   of   public

<p id="p_6"> 5        The   submission   of   the   learned   counsel   for   the 
 petitioners is that if sub-clauses 2 and 8 of clause 
 215   of   the   said   policy   are   read   together,   it   is 
 clear   that   the   additional   licences   were   issued 
 permitting   import   of   OGL   items   appearing   in 
 Appendix-6 List-8 Part-1.  Inviting our attention to 
 the said public notice, he pointed out that VTDM and 
 CPTs were deleted from Appendix-6 List-8 Part-1 from 
 the date of the said public notice and that the same 
 were included in the list of restricted items.   He 
 submitted   that   the   public   notice   refers     only   to 
 imports made under the OGL by eligible actual users 
 and   not   to   the   imports   of   OGL   items   under   the 
 additional licences issued to export houses/trading 
 houses.   He submitted   that the said public notice

 does   not   contain   any   provision   invalidating 
 additional licences issued prior to the date of the 
 said public notice.   He submitted that vested right 
 accrued   under   one   policy   cannot   be   taken   away   by 
 another   policy.     In   any   event,   he   submitted   that 
 sub-clause   2   of   clauses   223   and   224   of   the   Import 
 and   Export   policy   AM   1990-93   (for   short   "the 
 subsequent   policy")   permitted   the   holders   of   the 
 additional licences issued prior to 1st April 1990 to 
 import the items listed in Appendix-6 List-8-Part-1 
 of   the   OGL   provided   the     Letter   of   Credit   were 
 opened prior to 1st April 1990.

 prevailing when the licences are issued and the same 
 are   not   governed   by   the   subsequent   changes   in   the

 11       Thus, sub-clause 1 of clause 215 lays down that

 for   additional   licence   on   the   basis   of   the 
 admissible   exports   made   in   the   preceding   licencing

 sub-clause 2 provided that additional licences will

 clause   8   provides   that   additional   licence   will   be 
 valid   for   the   period   for   which   the   export 
 house/trading   house   certificates   are   valid.     Sub-
 clause 8 reiterates that additional licences will be

<p id="p_16"> 13       One of the arguments of the learned counsel for 
 the petitioners was that public notice applies only 
 to   the   Open   General   Licences   and   not   to   the 
 additional   licences.     According   to   us,   there   is   a 
 fallacy   in   this   argument.     We   have   referred   to 
 clause   61   of   the   said   policy   which   provides   that 
 Appendix   6   of   the   policy   contains   number   of   items 
 allowed   for   import   under   OGL   by   various   categories 
 of importers.   The export houses/trading houses are 
 entitled   to   additional   licenses   for   the   import   of 
 items     appearing   in   Part   1   of   the   List   8   of   the 
 Appendix 6 of the said policy.   Additional licence 
 can be granted only to export houses/trading houses 
 and   by   virtue   of   grant   of   additional   licence,   the 
 holder   thereof   is   entitled   to   import   OGL   items 




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">::: Uploaded on - 14/12/2017                ::: Downloaded on - 15/12/2017 02:00:41 :::</span>

 specified in Part 1 of the List 8 of the Appendix 6 
 of   the   said   policy.   The   Appendix   6   contains   the 
 items   which   can   be   imported   by   holders   of   OGL. 
 Thus,   if   some   item   goes   out   of   Appendix   6,   the 
 holder of additional licence cannot import the said 
 item.   The   other   question   will   be   whether   the   said 
 public   notice   will   affect   the   existing   additional 
 licences which were valid on the date of notice. We 
 have dealt with this question in the subsequent part 
 of this Judgment. 
</p>

<p id="p_17"> 14       We  may also make  a  reference  at this  stage  to 
 the   subsequent   policy   (for   the   years   1990-93). 
 Clauses   223   and   224   are   relevant   for   our 
 consideration.   Clause 1 of paragraph 223 lays down 
 that   additional   licences   issued   to   export 
 houses/trading houses prior to 1st April 1990 on the 
 basis of the exports made during 1986-87 or earlier 
 period shall cease to be valid on or after 1 st April 
 1990   for   the   import   of   the   items   of   raw   material, 
 components   and   spares   which   appear   in   Appendix-6 
 List-8 Part-I of the said policy but which are not 
 covered   by   Appendix-6   List-8   Part-I   of   the 
 subsequent   policy.     There   is   a   similar   provision 
 made   in   sub-clause   1   of   clause   224   in   respect   of 
 additional licences issued to export/trading houses 
 prior to 1st  April 1990 on the basis of the exports 
 made   during   1987-88   and   1988-89.     However,   sub-
 clauses 2 of both clauses 223 and 224 are relevant. 
 Both   the   clauses   provided   that   restriction   imposed 
 by   sub-clauses 1   of clauses 223 and 224 will not 
 apply to those licence holders who have already made

 firm   commitments   by   irrevocable   Letters   of   Credit 
 opened and established through authorised dealers in 
 foreign   exchange   on   or   before   31st  March   1990.     It 
 means that on the basis of the Additional licences 
 issued prior to 1st April 1990 on exports made in the 
 years 1986-87, 1987-88 and 1988-89, the imports made 
 after   1st  April   1990   will   be   valid   notwithstanding 
 sub-clauses   1   of   clauses   223   and   224   provided   the 
 irrevocable   Letters   of   Credit   have   been   opened   and 
 established   through   authorised   dealers   in   foreign 
 Exchange   prior   to   1st  April   1990.     Therefore, 
 wherever   the   Letters   of   Credit   as   aforesaid   have 
 been opened before the cut off date, the import on 
 the basis of the extended licences issued prior to 
 1st April 1990 was permissible.  The learned counsel 
 for   the   petitioner   stated   that   in   all   cases,   the 
 Letters   of   Credit   were   opened   prior   to   1st  April 
 1990.  In some cases where imports were made on the 
 basis of documents against payment, the imports have 
 been   made   prior   to   31st  March   1990.     Only   in   one 
 case, (in Writ Petition No.1805/90), the import was 
 made after 31st March 1990.

<blockquote id="blockquote_14">        "2.The following common contentions have been advanced by learned Counsel
        for the appellants:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_15">        (1) The import policy of which year would be applicable to the facts of the
        present case -- the period during which the licences were issued or the time
        when import actually took place.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_16">        (2) Whether "coconut oil" appearing in para 5 of Appendix 9 of the Import Policy of
        1980-81 was confined to the edible variety or covered the individual (sic-industrial)
        variety.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_17">        (3) Whether in the face of the decision of the Board and Central Government as
        the statutory appellate and revisional authorities, it was open to the Collector
        functioning in lower tier to take a contrary view of the matter in exercise of quasi-
        judicial jurisdiction; and
        (4) Whether the order of the Collector was vitiated for breach of rules of natural
        justice, and collateral considerations in the making of the orders.
        It is not in dispute that the relevant import policy to be referred to is of the
        year 1980-81 as all the licences were issued during that period. The Collector
        found and the High Court has not recorded a different finding that when the
        licence was first revalidated on 18-1-1982, such revalidation was subject to
        paragraph 215 of the Import Policy of 1981-82. Again while revalidating some of
        the licences on 25-9-1982, it was stipulated that during the extended period, items
        which do not appear in Appendices 5 and 7 of Import Policy of 1982-83 could not
        be allowed to be imported and items which appear in Appendix 26 of the Import
        Policy of 1982-83 will also not be allowed to be imported. The Collector turned
        down the plea that the licences allowed the import of items appearing in
        Appendices 5 and 7 of 1979-80 policy and 1982-83 policy in addition to the items
        appearing in the OGL and industrial coconut oil. In the instant case, the licences
        were either of 1980 or 1981 and were revalidated from time to time. For
        convenience we may refer to a sample order of revalidation dated 28-6-1982.
        Revalidation was subject to the following conditions:
        "This  licence is revalidated for a further period of six months from the date of
        revalidation with the condition that during the extended period of validity the
        items which do not appear in Appendices 5 and 7 of the Import Policy of 1982-83
        will not be imported. This licence will also not be valid for the import of items
        appearing in Appendix 26 of the Import Policy of 1982-83 during the extended
        period of validity.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_18">        3.The High Court has come to the correct conclusion that the terms of
        Import Policy of 1980-81 would apply to the facts of these cases. "

</pre><p id="p_20"> Clearance of the goods was not allowed on the ground 
 that the goods were not as specified in the import 
 licence.  It was objected on the ground that  under 
 the   import   licence,   the   appellant   was   entitled   to 
 import only prime quality steel sheets and what was 
 imported   was   industrial   scrap   sheets.   The   argument 
 of the appellant before the Authority was that the 
 licence     did not contain a condition of importing 
 prime quality sheets.  The condition that the sheets 
 must be of prime quality was imposed for the first 
 time   by   the   public   notice   dated   6 th  December   1962. 
 The   Revisional   Authority   took   the   view   that   the 
 public   notice   dated   6th  December   1962   was   issued 
 after   the   licence   was   issued     and   the   said   notice 
 had   no   retrospective   operation.   In   paragraph   5   and 
 6, the Apex Court observed thus: 
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_20">        "5.Interrupting   the narrative, it is necessary to point out at this stage two
        important matters: (1) that the difference in the conditions of the two licences was
        apparently not noticed by the Collector of Customs and by the Board and ( 2) that
        the condition that the goods should be of "prime quality" was not a condition of
        either licence. Under the first licence the sheets were to be of 18 gauge quality;
        under the second licence there was no such condition relating to thickness of the
        sheets. There was again no evidence that any part of the consignment was not fit
        for use in the manufacture of drums and barrels. By importing sheets of 11, 12
        and 13 gauge or of gauges varying between 18 and 24 no breach of the conditions
        of the second licence was committed. The condition that the sheets imported
        must be of "prime quality" was imposed for the first time by the Iron and
        Steel Controller's Public Notice No.I/I-S/62, dated December 6, 1962 and
        could not obviously apply to the sheets imported under the two licences
        which were issued earlier. But the Collector as well as the Central Board of
        Excise and Customs decided the cases principally on the ground that the goods
        were not of "prime quality". The Collector of Customs and the Central Board of
        Excise and Customs also did not keep the facts in respect of the twelve
        consignments distinct and decided them together as if there was no difference
        between the conditions of the two licences.

        consolidated for the purpose of hearing and a single order was passed. The
        Officer who heard the revision applications on behalf of the Central
        Government was of the view, and rightly, that the Public Notice No. I/I-S/62,
        dated December 6, 1962 of the Iron and Steel Controller had no
        retrospective operation and the condition of "prime quality" could not be
        applied to the sheets imported under the licences issued before that date.
        But in his view, one of the two licences e.g. licence, dated June 13, 1962, covering
        the consignments was issued specifically for 18 gauge sheets, while sheets of
        different sizes (including 18 gauge) were imported against that licence and on that
        account consignments covered by that licence "had to be treated as
        unauthorised". He then proceeded to observe that the fine in lieu of confiscation

        535/63-LC all, dated November 30, 1963, be remitted in full; that in respect of four
        consignments covered by the Collector's Orders S/10-443/63-LC, S/10-444/63-LC,
        S/10-445/63-LC and S/10-446/63-LC all, dated October 5, 1963, the five be reduced
        by half; and that the fines reduced by the Board in the cases covered by the
        Collector's Orders S/10-22/64-LC and S/10-71/64-LC both, dated March 2, 1964, be

 <a href="/doc/321243/" id="a_7">Jayant Vegoils And Chemical (P) Limited vs. Union of 
 India3</a>. In this case, import licences were issued on 
 the basis of the policy for the period of April 1980 
 to   March   1981.     Show   cause   notices   were   issued   to 
 the   petitioner   in   respect   of   the   eight   licences 
 granted during the subsistence of the said policy of 
 1980-81.   Licences were in respect of beef tallow. 
 In   the   show   cause   notice,   it   was   alleged   that   the 
 licences   were   not   valid   for   the   import   of   beef 
 tallow.   A public notice was issued on 5 th June 1981 
 as   a   result   of   which   beef   tallow   could   not   be 
 imported   thereafter   under   OGL,   but   only   through   a 
 canalising agency.   The   contention of the Revenue 
 was   that   after   5th  June   1981,   on   the   basis   of   the 
 licence   granted   earlier,   import   of   beef   tallow   was 
 not   permissible.   The   learned   Single   Judge   observed 
 in paragraph 6 as under:
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_24">        "The gravemen of the charge is that after June 5, 1981 the petitioners were
        not entitled to import beef tallow as the import was canalised through the
        State Trading Corporation. The petitioners on the other hand contend that
        each R.E.P. import licences were issued prior to June 5, 1981 and each of the
        licence contains a condition that the licence would be subject to the
        conditions in force relating to the goods at the time of issuance of the
        licence. The petitioners claim that as the public notice dated June 5, 1981
        did not specifically prohibit import of beef tallow under licence granted
        prior to June 5, 1981, the import though was of a period subsequent to June
        5, 1981, was not in contravention of any law. The petitioners claim that the
        Government of India and the Central Board of Excise and Customs have always
        accepted the position that in respect of the licences granted prior to June 5, 1981
        it is open to import beef tallow subsequent to June 5, 1981, in the absence of
        specific prohibition in the public notice."

        is whether the petitioners violated any provisions of the Import (Control) Order,
        1955 by import of beef tallow subsequent to June 5, 1981. It is not in dispute that
        8 R.E.P. licences held by petitioner No. 1 and granted during the subsistence of
        Import Policy of AM 1981 enabled the petitioners to import beef tallow under
        O.G.L. It is not in dispute that for the entire Policy period AM 1981 the item
        "beef tallow" was not a canalised item and was available for import under
        O.G.L. It is also not in dispute that at the time of declaration of Import
        Policy for AM 1982 beef tallow was not made a canalised item but could be
        imported under O.G.L. Condition 1 set out in the import licence reads as under:

<blockquote id="blockquote_27">        "This  licence will be subject to the conditions in force relating to the goods
        covered by the licence, as described in the Import Trade Control Policy Book for
        the period during which the licence has been issued, or any amendments thereof
        made upto, and including the date of issue of the licence, unless otherwise
        specified. Relying on this clause, Shri Desai urged that the importability
        under the licence was governed by the Import Policy prevailing on the date
        of issue of licence and as beef tallow could be imported under O.G.L. at the
        time of issuance of the licence, it is not open for the respondents to claim
        that the import could not be effected subsequent to June 5, 1981. As
        mentioned hereinabove, it is not in dispute that the public notice dated
        June 5, 1981 did not specify that the inclusion of beef tallow as a canalised
        item would affect the licence granted prior to that date. Shri Desai then
        submits that not only this position is very clear by the plain reading of the licence
        and the Import Policy, but the Central Board of Excise and Customs and the
        Government of India have consistently taken that view. The submissions of the
        learned counsel is correct. "

              Thereafter, the learned Judge proceeded to hold thus:</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_29">               "It is futile for the respondents to suggest that as soon as the policy was
        amended on June 5, 1981 the import of beef tallow would be prohibited under the
        licences issued during 1980-81 unless firm commitments made by opening
        irrevocable letters of credit are established prior to April 1, 1981.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_30">                  .........Shri Dhanuka is right in his submission that once the item is
        included in Appendices 8 and 9, then it is not permissible for the licence
        holder, who has secured licence subsequent to that date, to import beef
        tallow, but that would not prevent the licence holder who has secured the
        licence prior to that date. As there is no specific prohibition in the public
        notice affecting the earlier licence holders, it is not possible to disturb their
        rights. "

 a Division Bench of this Court, the issue was about

 and export policy of April 1988 to March 1991 was in 
 force.   The argument before the Division Bench was 
 that   the   licence   was   valid   for   18   months   from   13 th 
 February 1990 and as the import had taken place in 
 June 1992 after expiry of the policy of 1988-91, the 
 import will be governed by the policy for the years 
 1991-94.  The Division Bench considered the decision

 the aforesaid decision of the Apex Court, this Court

        " 21.   It must be emphasised that in the case of Raj Prakash, this position has
        been explained by saying that only such items could be imported by diamond
        exporters under the Additional Licences granted to them as could have been
        imported under the Import Policy of 1978-79, the period during which the
        diamond exporters had applied for Export House Certificates and had been
        wrongly refused and were also importable under the import policy prevailing at
        the time of import which in the present case would be during the Import Policy of
        1985-88. These were the items which had not been "specifically banned" under
        the prevalent import policy. The items had to pass two tests, firstly, they should
        have been importable under the Import Policy 1978-79 and secondly they should
        also have been importable under the Import Policy 1985-88 in terms of the order
        dated April 18, 1985 and if one may add, in such terms "in accordance with the
        import rules" whether canalised or not canalised. It must be emphasised that in
        this case also, the court had no occasion to consider the significance of the words
        "whether canalised or otherwise" mentioned in the order dated April 18, 1985
        because that point did not arise in the case before it. What did the court then
        intend by these words used by the court? We have seen that diamond exporters
        could import the items which they were entitled to import under the Import
        Policy 1978-79 provided they were importable also under the import policy ruling
        at the time of import. These are items which were open to import by Export
        Houses holding Additional Licences for sale to the Actual Users (Industrial). These
        are items which were directly imported, for example, items in Part 2 List 8 of
        Appendix 6 of Import Policy 1985-88. These are items which are not canalised.
        Canalised items are those items which are ordinarily open to import only through
        a public sector agency. Although generally these are importable through public
        sector agencies, it is permissible for any import policy to provide an exception to
        the rule and to declare that an importer might import a canalised item directly. It
        is in that sense and that sense only that the court could have intended to define
        the entitlement of diamond exporters. They would be entitled to import items
        which were canalised or not if the import policy prevailing at the time of
        import permitted them to import items falling under such category. This was

        also viewed in that light in the case of Indo Afghan Chambers of Commerce
        [(1986)3SCC352]

        did not do away with canalisation. That was not the issue before this Court. The
        expression "whether canalised or not canalised" was to include both. This Court
        did not say that canalised items could be imported directly by the importers
        ignoring the canalisation process. We are of the opinion that this Court did not
        say that canalisation could be ignored. That was not the issue. High public policy,
        it must be emphasised, is involved in the scheme of canalisation. This purpose of
        canalisation was examined by this Court in <a href="/doc/1687920/" id="a_9">Daruka &amp; Co. v. Union of India</a> [AIR

        1973 SC 2711 : (1974) 1 SCR 570 : (1973) 2 SCC 617] where the Constitution Bench
        of this Court observed that the policies of imports or exports were fashioned not
        only with reference to internal or international trade, but also on monetary policy,
        the development of agriculture and industries and even on the political policies of
        the country and rival theories and views may be held on such policies. If the
        Government decided an economic policy that import or export should be by a
        selected channel or through selected agencies the court would proceed on the
        assumption that the decision was in the interest of the general public unless the
        contrary was shown. Therefore it could not be collaterally altered in the manner
        suggested. The policy of canalisation which is a matter of policy of the
        Government was not given a go-by by the observations referred to in the order of
        April 18, 1985. Indeed it is possible to read the order in a manner consistent with
        canalisation scheme in the way we have indicated. If that is so, then it should be
        so read. When this Court observed that the fact whether items were sought to be
        imported by diamond merchants were canalised would not be an impediment to
        the import directly by them, the court meant to say that this could be imported
        directly by them through the canalisation organisation. The need for canalisation
        stands on public policy and that need cannot be lightly or inferentially given a go-
        by. It should not be presumed that collaterally the court had done away with the
        system of canalisation based on sound public policy. We have found nothing in
        the different authorities on this subject, which militate against the above views.
        Therefore, the action taken by the Custom authorities in issuing adjudication
        notice and proceeding in the manner they did, we are of the opinion that they
        have not acted illegally or without jurisdiction. This must proceed in accordance
        with law as laid down by this Court which, in our opinion, is clear enough. The fact
        that in subsequent decisions, the petitioner is not a party is not relevant.
        Generally legal positions laid down by the court would be binding on all
        concerned even though some of them have not been made parties nor were
        served       nor       any    notice     of      such      proceedings       given."

        It was found and it is common ground now that 
        that   was   wrong.     Therefore,   the   wrong   was 
        undone.     Those   who   had   been   denied   Export

                          "Canalised   items   are   those   items 
        which   are   ordinarily   open   to   import   only

           In   this   case,   the   licence   in   question   was 
 issued on 29th June 1981 when import policy of 81-82 
 was in force.     On the basis of the public notice 
 dated   5th  June   1981,   a   notice   was   issued   by   the 
 Department   to   the   assessee.     Notice   was   issued   on 
 the basis of the contention that after 5th June 1981 
 import of beef tallow was not permissible.  An order 
 of   confiscation   was   passed   by   the   Collector   of 
 Customs on the ground that import of beef tallow was 
 not permissible. Accordingly, the assessee preferred 
 an Appeal.   The Tribunal held that right to import 
 the goods under OGL is a statutory right and cannot 
 be overruled by a public notice and that the import 
 of beef tallow which ceased to be OGL item when it 
 was   canalized   by   the   public   notice   is   governed   by 
 the   import   policy   when   the   licence   was   issued   and 
 not by the public notice. Therefore, an appeal was 
 preferred   before   the   Apex   Court.   The   Apex   Court 
 allowed the Appeal after considering its decision in 
 the   case   of   D.   Navinchandra.   In   paragraphs   14   and

        canalised or not, is governed by the Import Policy prevalent at the time of

        amendment of the Policy by the public notice dated 11-11-1983 in a manner

<p id="p_24"> 26       We   have   already   referred   to   the   subsequent 
 policy which came into force on 1 st April 1990. Sub-
 clauses   1   of   both   clauses   223   and   224   thereof 
 provide   that   additional   licences   issued   to 
 export/trading houses prior to  1st  April  1990 shall 
 cease   to   be   valid   on   or   after   1st  April   1990.   In 
 these   petitions   under   <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_16">Article   226</a>   of   the 
 Constitution of India, there is no challenge to sub-
 clauses   1   of   clause   223   and   224   of   the   subsequent 
 policy.   However,   sub-clauses   2   of   clauses   223   and 
 224 protect imports made after 1st April 1990 subject 
 to   the   conditions   mentioned   therein.   Both   the 
 clauses,   provided   that   the   restriction   imposed   by 
 sub-clauses 1  of clauses 223 and 224 will not apply 
 to those licence holders who have already made firm 
 commitments by irrevocable Letters of Credit opened 
 and   established   through   authorised   dealers   in 
 foreign   exchange   on   or   before   31st  March   1990.     It 
 means that on the basis of the Additional licences 
 issued   prior   to   1st  April   1990   on   exports   made   in 
 1986-87, 1987-88 and 1988-89, the imports made after 
 1st  April   1990   will   be   valid   notwithstanding   sub-
 clauses   1   of   clauses   223   and   224   provided   the 
 irrevocable   Letters   of   Credit   have   been   opened   and 
 established   through   authorised   dealers   in   foreign 
 Exchange   prior   to   1st  April   1990.     Therefore, 
 wherever   the   Letters   of   Credit   as   aforesaid   have 
 been opened before the cut off date, the import on

 1st April 1990 was permissible.

<p id="p_25"> 27       Therefore,   the   petitioners   are   entitled   to 
 relief in respect of the cases which are governed by 
 the   sub-clauses   2   of   clauses   223   and   224   of   the 
 subsequent policy (1990-93). 
</p>

<p id="p_26"> 28       We have perused the Order in Original passed by 
 the Collector of Customs.   The order is completely 
 erroneous as it relies upon the said public notice. 
 We   have   already   held   that   the   said   public   notice 
 will not affect the validity of additional licences 
 issued earlier.  However, after the said policy came 
 to an end on 31st March 1990, the additional licences 
 which were unexpired and valid would be governed by 
 the sub-clauses 1 and 2 of the clauses 223 and 224 
 of   the   said   subsequent   policy.     In   view   of   sub-
 clause   2,   the   import   under   the   additional   licences 
 could have been permitted after 1st  April 1990 only 
 if the petitioners had made confirmed commitment by 
 irrevocable Letters of Credit opened and established 
 through authorised dealers in foreign exchange prior 
 to   1st  April   1990.     However,   if   an   extension 
 thereafter   is   made   after   31 st  March   1990,   the   same 
 shall   be   treated   as   a   fresh   commitment   to   which 
 protection under sub-clause 2 will not apply.

<p id="p_27"> 29       In these writ petitions, we cannot go into the 
 question of fact whether the petitioners had already 
 made confirmed commitments by irrevocable Letters of 
 Credit   opened   and   established   through   authorised
