ORAL JUDGMENT</pre>
 


 


 
	  


<p id="p_1">	Heard learned
	counsel for the petitioner. Rule. Rule is waived by learned counsels
	for the respondents.  Matter is fixed forthwith with the consent of
	learned counsels for the parties.
</p>	 


	
	  


<p id="p_2">	Both the counsels
	have after making submissions at length on their points ultimately
	requested the Court for disposing of this matter by transferring
	Criminal Case No. 2088 of 2005 pending before Learned JMFC, Deesa at
	Banaskantha, be transferred to the Court of Learned JMFC at Unjha,
	where the case  being Criminal Case No. 262 of 2003 is pending and
	being decided, concerned Court may be directed to  hear both the
	cases after affording opportunity to the parties. In support of the
	contention learned counsel Mr. V.G. Popat has relied upon para no. 8
	of the case reported in 2001(1) GLHEL-SC 30664, in case of Sudhir
	Versus State of Madhya Pradesh with State of Madhya Pradesh Vs.
	Lavkush, which read as under:- 
</p>	

 


 


 


<p id="p_3"> 8.	It is a
salutary practice, when two criminal cases relate to the same
incident, they are tried and disposed of by the same Court by
pronouncing judgments on the same day. Such two different versions of
the same incident resulting in two criminal cases are compendiously
called  case and counter case  by some High Courts and  cross
cases  by some other High Courts. Way back in nineteen hundred and 
twenties a Division Bench of the Madras High Court (Waller and
Cornish, JJ) made a suggestion ( In Re Goriparthi Krishtamma 1929 Mad
WN 881) that  a case and counter case arising out of the same
affair should always, if practicable, be tried by the same Court; and
each party would represent themselves as having been the innocent
victims of the aggression of the other. 
</p> 


 


 
	  


<p id="p_4">	Both the  counsels
	have agreed that they will request their  counterparts not to seek
	adjournments which are otherwise avoidable and they will cooperate
	in expeditious hearing of both the cases. Orders accordingly.  On
	receiving the papers of Criminal Case No. 2088 of 2005  from Learned
	JMFC Court at Deesa, Banaskantha district,  appropriate re-number be
	given by Learned JMFC Court at Unjha,  same be heard along with
	Criminal Case No. 262 of 2003.  Petition is disposed of accordingly.
	Rule made absolute.
</p>
