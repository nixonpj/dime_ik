 for R3. My findings on the issues are as under:-


8.         FINDINGS ON ISSUE NUMBER 1:
           Petitioner has stated in his affidavit that on 15.01.08 he along with Prateek,
Nikhil, two teachers and other students of his school were going to school van RTV which
was being driven by Sh. Kanhaiya Lal and when they reached at GTK Bypass, Mukarba
Chowk, Red Light, Jahangir Puri at about 7:05 am and were crossing the chowk on green
signal, then a truck No. HR-69A-0070 came at a very high speed and in a rash and negligent
manner and jumped the red signal and violently hit school RTV van and as a result of which
all the occupants of the said van sustained injuries/grievous injuries. I perused the cross-
examination of petitioner. Nothing has come during cross examination from which it can be
said that the testimony of petitioner is not trustworthy and should be rejected. Certified
copies of criminal record shows that R1 was charge-sheeted. Prima facie, it shows that he
was driving the vehicle No. HR-69-A-0070 in rahs and negligent manner. Two other injured
namely Master Prateek and Nikhil have corroborated the version of petitioner Master
Gagandeep Singh. Therefore, I am of the veiw that petitioner has proved the fact that he had
sustained injuries due to rash and negligent driving of Truck No. HR-69-A-0070 on
15.01.08 at about 7:05 am. This issue is decided in favour of petitioner and against the
respondents.</pre>

</p><p id="p_6">           In his affidavit, petitioner has stated that he had sustained injuries like multiple
bruises and abrasions on right lumber region. No doubt, petitioner must have suffered pain
and agony at the time of accident and also during treatment. Therefore, petitioner be paid
Rs. 10,000/- under this head.

</p><p id="p_9">           Petitioner has claimed for special diet and conveyance charges, but he has not

required for treatment in accidental case, let he be paid Rs. 1000/- on special diet.
</p><p id="p_10">           He has stated that he had visited hospital during the treatment. As per record, he
has visited hospital about 8-10 times. Therefore, if he is paid Rs. 1000/- as conveyance
charges, it would meet the end of justice. Therefore, he is granted Rs. 1000/- under the
head of conveyance charge.

</pre><p id="p_17">12.       To sum up I hold that petitioner is entitled to receive Rs. 23,081/-.
</p><p id="p_18">13.       It is primarily duty of R1 and R2 to pay compensation. As far as the liability of
R3 is concerned, it is submitted by Ld. Cl for R3 that R3 is not liable to pay any
compensation since R1 was not having DL to drive the offending truck No. HR-69A-0070 at
the time of accident. He has submitted that R3W1 HC Brijveer has proved the fact that
driver Vinod was also charge sheeted for the offence punishable U/s 3/181 of <a href="/doc/785258/" id="a_3">MV Act</a>
which shows that he was not having DL at the time of accident. It is further submitted that
R3W2 has proved the fact that legal notice U/o 12 Rule 8 CPC was sent to the owner of the
offending truck to produce the original policy and the DL of R1 and notice was sent by
registered AD. He has also proved the fact that neither the envelope not AD was received
back. Cl for R3 submits that presumption should be drawn that notice was served upon the
driver and owner of the offending vehicle. Cl for R3 has relied upon the case law namely
Sardar &amp; Ors Appellants Vs. Sushil Kumar &amp; Ors Respondents, III (2008) SLT 605,
Malla Prakas Rao Vs. Mall Janki, I (2006) ACC 300 (SC) and Ishwar Singh &amp; Ors Vs.
Jagjit Singh 2004 (2) TAC 930 (Del.) in support of his arguments that R3 is not liable to
pay compensation since driver of the offending vehicle was not having any DL.

<pre id="pre_4">MACT No. 214/08                                                                   5 of 6
 14.        RELIEF
</pre><p id="p_19">           I considered the submission of Cl for R3 and case law as mentioned above.
R1was also charge-sheeted U/s 3/181 of <a href="/doc/785258/" id="a_4">MV Act</a> since no DL was produced by him during
investigation. Even notice U/o 12 Rule 8 was sent to driver and owner of the offending
vehicle to produce DL. There is evidence that neither envelope nor AD received back and I
am of the view that legal notice was served on the driver and owner of the offending vehicle
but they have not produced DL. I presumed that R1 was not having any DL on the date of
accident. Therefore, I agree with the submission of Cl for R3 that R3 is not liable to pay
compensation. This issue is decided accordingly.
</p><p id="p_20">           I have already held above that the petitioner is entitled to receive Rs. 23,081/-
from R1 &amp; R2. I direct R1 and R2 to pay the said amount jointly and severally to petitioner
within 45 days of today alongwith interest @ 7.5% per annum to be calculated from the
date of institution till date of actual deposit failing which petitioner would be entitled to
further interest @ 7.5% for the delayed period.
</p>

<p id="p_21">15.        Petition is disposed off on aforesaid terms. File be consigned to record room.
Copy be provided to both the parties for compliance.
