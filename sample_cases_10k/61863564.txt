CORAM : HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE A.N. JINDAL


Present:     Mr. Anuj Balian, Advocate,
             for the petitioners.

             Mr. Arvinder Arora, Advocate,
             for respondent Nos. 11 and 12.

<p id="p_1">             This petition has arisen out of the order dated 13.10.2010

passed by the Additional Civil Judge (Senior Division), Naraingarh,

allowing the application filed by the plaintiffs-respondents (herein referred

as 'the respondents') for dismissing the counter claim filed by the

defendants-petitioners (herein referred as 'the petitioners').

</p><p id="p_2">             Factual background of the case is that originally in a suit for

declaration filed by Rajni Rani etc. against Kharaiti Lal etc., they had

challenged the decree dated 23.02.1995 suffered by Jetha Ram in favour of

defendant Nos. 1 to 3-petitioners. The present petitioners had contested that

suit and the trial Court, vide judgment dated 21.09.2002, held the plaintiffs

as co-sharers to the extent of 1/4th share. However, that judgment was
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1"> Civil Revision No. 900 of 2011 (O&amp;M)                                      2</span>


challenged in an appeal, wherein the Appellate Court came to the

conclusion that the said property being owned by deceased Jetha Ram, had

to be shared equally between all the legal heirs according to the <a href="/doc/685111/" id="a_1">Hindu

Succession Act</a>. Accordingly, all the legal heirs were held entitled to the suit

property on the basis of the said judgment passed by the Appellate Court.

Therefore, Phoolan Devi wife of Om Parkash daughter of Jetha Ram and

others have filed a suit for declaration and permanent injunction, wherein

the petitioners had filed the counter claim by setting up a Will dated

18.05.1995 executed by Jetha Ram in favour of the petitioners. The trial

Court declined the counter claim on the ground that the petitioners have

never claimed rights on the basis of the said Will, therefore, the suit is

barred under Order 2 Rule 2 CPC.
</p>
<p id="p_3">             Having heard the rival contentions, there is no denying a fact

that the decree dated 23.02.1995 was challenged by Rajni Rani etc. in the

previous suit No. 505 dated 25.05.1995, which was decided on 21.09.2002.

The said suit was filed against the petitioners as well as Jetha Ram. The

Will dated 18.05.1995 could not be set up at that time, as Jetha Ram was

alive and the petitioners could claim their rights on the basis of the Will

only after the death of Jetha Ram, as the same was to operate on his death.

As such, the suit cannot be said to be barred by Order 2 Rule 2 CPC. If any

right had accrued to the petitioners on the basis of the said Will after the

death of Jetha Ram, then they could raise the same in the counter claim by

setting up the said Will. The trial Court appears to have not properly

appreciated the factual position and discarded the counter claim, which was

to be adjudicated like a suit and did not deserve to be thrown away merely

on the application filed by the respondents.

</p><p id="p_5">             Under these circumstances, this petition is accepted; the

impugned order is set aside and the trial Court is directed to proceed in

accordance with law.
</p>
<p id="p_6">             However, the plaintiffs would be at liberty to raise all the pleas

against the counter claim, submitted by the petitioners.</p><pre id="pre_2">
