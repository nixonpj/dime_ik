 PC:-

</pre><p id="p_1"> 1.        We have heard the learned counsel appearing for the

 Applicants, the learned counsel appearing for the 1st Respondent,

 the learned counsel appearing for the 3rd Respondent and

 learned AGP for the State. We have heard 4th Respondent

 appearing in person.            The contention raised in the Affidavit in

 Support of the Notice of Motion is that the statements made by

 their advocate which are recorded in the orders disposing of the

 Writ Petitions were made without their instructions. The learned

 counsel appearing for the Applicants prays for time as a copy of

 the Reply filed by the 4th Respondent is served upon him during

 the course of the day today. However, he prays for ad-interim

 relief.
</p>
<p id="p_2"> 2.        The challenge in the Writ Petitions filed by the Applicants

 societies (Petitioners in Writ Petitions) was to the report dated 7th

 May, 2018 submitted by Technical Advisory Committee which

 records that the subject buildings are in dangerous and

 dilapidated condition and may collapse without giving any warning

 thereby endangering life and property of the residents and

 passers by. There are three sets of orders passed in this group.

 In all the orders disposing of the Writ Petitions, the statement of

 the learned counsel appearing for the Applicants / Petitioners is

 recorded that all the members of the Applicant societies as well as

 all the occupants of all the premises in the buildings subject

 matter of the Petitions were ready and willing to file undertakings

 in this Court to vacate the premises in their respective possession

 and to handover vacant possession of the same to the Municipal

 Corporation for its demolition on or before 31st October, 2018.

 Considering the said statement that this Court while disposing of

 the Petitions directed Municipal Corporation not to take action of

 demolition till 31st October, 2018 subject to undertaking being

 filed by the office bearers of the Applicants societies and their

 members and occupants of the premises.            Some of the Writ

 Petitions in which Notices of Motion have been taken out were

 disposed of on 4th July, 2018 when the Applicants were

 represented by the learned Senior counsel of this Court.

</p><p id="p_4"> 3.      The contentions raised in the Affidavit in Support of these

 Notices of Motion is that the advocate on record as well as senior

 counsel made statements before the Court without instructions

 from the Applicants that they were willing to file undertakings to

 vacate. Shri Jondhale, the learned advocate for the 4th

 Respondent has filed Affidavit in Reply refuting the said

 allegations and has reiterated that he was instructed to make

 statements which are recorded in the orders passed by this Court

 while disposing of the Writ Petitions.
</p>
<p id="p_5"> 4.      The prayer in Notices of Motion is for recall of the orders

 passed in the Writ Petitions.
</p>
<p id="p_6"> 5.      In this case, there are two versions on record. One version

 on oath by the litigants is that they did not instruct their advocate

 to make statements which are recorded in the orders of this Court.

 The other version on oath is by the advocate who is an officer of

 the Court. He has stated that he made statements on express

 instructions.

 senior counsel made statements without instructions of the

 Applicants and / or their authorised office bearers.

 protecting buildings for a limited period for more than one reason.

 The first reason is that the applicants want to file rejoinder

 disputing contentions raised by the 4th Respondent. Secondly, as

 prima facie we are not inclined to entertain the Notices of Motion,

 we indicated to the learned counsel appearing for the Applicants

 that considering the fact that large number of families are

 occupying the buildings, we may consider of extending the time to

 vacate granted under the orders passed in the Writ Petitions by a

 reasonable period as a last chance subject to applicants filing

 fresh undertaking in terms of their statements recorded in the Writ

 Petitions.      Third reason is that festival of Diwali is around the

 corner. We make it clear that the occupants / members of the

 Applicants will continue to occupy their premises at their own risk,

 and in the event of fall of the buildings or part even thereof, they

 will be solely responsible for the loss or damage caused to third

 parties. Rejoinder, if any, be filed on or before 19th November,

 2018.

<p id="p_10"> 8.      Place the Notices of Motion for hearing on 24th November,

 2018 at 5.00 p.m. Only by way of indulgence and for the reasons

 recorded above and subject to what is observed above, we direct

 the Municipal Corporation not to demolish buildings subject matter

 of these Notices of Motion, till the next date.

 shown on board. As the same are not assigned to this Bench, the

 same may be placed before the appropriate bench.
