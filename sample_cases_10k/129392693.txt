     THIS WRIT PETITION COMING ON FOR PRELIMINARY
HEARING IN 'B' GROUP THIS DAY, THE COURT MADE THE
FOLLOWING: -

                        ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">     Writ petitioner claims to be the owner of land

bearing survey number 34/1 measuring 34 guntas

located in Chamundi Hill Village, Mysore.


</p><p id="p_2">2.   The case of the petitioner is that she acquired title

to this land through a sale deed dated 21.3.2001

executed in her favour by the erstwhile owner one B.S.

Ramachandran and his family members.


</p><p id="p_3">3.   It is also the case of the petitioner that thereafter

the revenue entries stood in the name of the petitioner.

It appears writ petitioner had sought for permission to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                              -3-</span>

convert     this   agricultural    revenue    land     for    non-

agricultural purpose, particularly, to build a commercial

structure to start a Vegetarian Hotel in the subject land

as it is claimed that the subject land was located close

to Chamundi Hills Temple and had great tourist

attraction etc. It is the version of the petitioner that the

Village Panchayat with in which limits the subject land

is located had also issued NOC for the conversion of

land from agricultural to non-agricultural use.


</p><p id="p_4">4.    Writ petitioner being aggrieved by the order of

rejection    dated   23.4.2003     passed    by    the   Deputy

Commissioner, Mysore, appealed to the Karnataka

Appellate Tribunal under Section 49 of the Karnataka

Land Revenue Act, 1964, (for short 'the Act').                The

contention     urged    by   the    petitioner    is   that    the

application was not disposed of within one year and no

valid reasons had been given for refusal to permit the

conversion on any other grounds.            The tribunal went
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                 -4-</span>

into the question in some detail and thought it proper to

condone the delay, but on examination of the matter on

the merits, found that there is no occasion to interfere

with the order passed by the Deputy Commissioner so

as to change the land usage, not only in conformity with

the plan prepared by the MUDA and MUDA had also

objected for such permission.         The subject land being

located near the lake and the commercial development

of the land posing a threat to the lake and the

environment,    was      also    examined    and   therefore,

dismissed the appeal and confirmed the order passed by

the Deputy Commissioner. It is against these orders the

present writ petition.
</p>
<p id="p_5">
</p><p id="p_6">5.   What is urged in this writ petition is that the

Deputy Commissioner without due application of mind

has passed the order mechanically and has refused

permission for conversion of the subject land and

having taken more than one year for disposal of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                             -5-</span>

application, the application should be deemed to have

been permitted and ordered and in such circumstances,

there was no occasion for the Deputy Commissioner to

later on reject the application by issue of impugned

endorsement dated 23.4.2003 (copy at Annexure C).

The tribunal has also not noticed that the order having

been passed by the Deputy Commissioner after expiry of

one year period, petitioner should be deemed to have

been permitted for the change of land usage etc.


</p><p id="p_7">6.   Notice had been issued to the respondents and

respondents have been represented by Smt.S. Susheela,

learned AGA.
</p>
<p id="p_8">
</p><p id="p_9">7.   It is submitted by Smt.S. Susheela, learned AGA

appearing for the respondents that the tribunal has

passed an elaborate order giving the reasons as to why

the appeal is to be dismissed; that a positive order of

rejection   having   been    passed   by   the     Deputy

Commissioner, no deemed provision can operate, with
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                -6-</span>

the failure of the petitioner before the Tribunal, who has

also looked into the merits of the matter and found no

occasion to interfere with the order of the Deputy

Commissioner and as such there is no occasion for

interference     with    the   impugned      order   in   writ

jurisdiction.
</p>
<p id="p_10">
</p><p id="p_11">8.    On examination of the merits of the matter, I find

it is not as though the Deputy Commissioner or the

Tribunal have not given any reasons in the orders based

on which they have rejected permission for conversion.

If the authorities having regard to the location of the

subject land and environment angle, find it is not

feasible or right to grant permission for conversion of

subject   land    from   agricultural   to   non-agricultural

purpose, no exception can be taken to such orders.


</p><p id="p_12">9.    I do not find any good ground to interfere with the

impugned orders either to set aside the orders or grant
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                         -7-</span>

permission.   It is therefore, this writ petition is

dismissed.
