<pre id="pre_2">     For Petitioner                             :       Mr. A. K. Yadav, Advocate
     For State/respondent No. 1, 2 &amp; 5          :       Mr. P. Acharya, PL

                            Hon'ble Shri Justice P. Sam Koshy
                                     Order on Board
15/07/2019

</pre><p id="p_1">        1. The petitioner through the present writ petition has challenged the

             impugned order Annexure P-1 dated 24.06.2019 whereby the

             respondent No. 3 has discontinued the services of the petitioner.

</p><p id="p_2">        2. The facts of the case is that the petitioner was appointed as Rojgar

             Sahayak, Gram Panchayat, Bhalla, under the Janpad Panchayat,

             Ramchandrapur, District Balrampur, Ramanujganj in the year 2017
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                     2</span>


   on contract basis. Having put in about two years of service, the

   respondent No. 3 has now passed the impugned order Annexure P-1

   dated 24.06.2019 whereby the services of the petitioner has been

   terminated. The order of termination has been passed putting various

   allegations against the petitioner of misconduct as well as of

   dereliction of duty. According to the petitioner the services of the

   petitioner was getting renewed periodically and that there had been

   no complaint whatsoever against the petitioner nor was the petitioner

   ever issued with a show cause notice or warning letter issued in

   respect of misconduct, irregularity or dereliction of duty on the part of

   the petitioner. He further submits that termination of contractual

   appointment of the petitioner abruptly after casting allegations makes

   the impugned order stigmatic order and also in violation of basic

   principles of natural justice in as much as the petitioner has not been

   granted any opportunity of hearing or defence before the impugned

   order was passed. Thus, the impugned order is hit by <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_1">Article 14</a> of the

   Constitution of India.
</p>
<p id="p_3">3. On the other hand, learned counsel for the State, would submit that

   the petitioner was a contract appointee, therefore, if any complaint

   was made against him and he was found to have committed

   irregularities and dereliction in duties, the order of termination is fully

   justified.
</p>
<p id="p_4">4. Bare perusal of the impugned order of termination would manifest

   that the petitioner has been terminated with immediate effect. The

   order does not refer to any show cause notice or enquiry, wherein,

   the petitioner was allowed to participate. It is per se in violation of the

   principles of natural justice, which is clearly established from the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                            3</span>


           language of the order of termination itself, therefore, for the reason

           that no order adverse to an individual be passed without following the

           principles of natural justice, as held by the Supreme Court in the

           matter of    <a href="/doc/175112114/" id="a_2">State of Punjab &amp; Ors. v. Senior Vocational Staff

           Masters Association &amp; Ors</a>. (AIR 2017 SC 4072), the impugned

           order deserves to be and is hereby quashed at the admission stage

           itself. However, liberty is reserved in favour of the competent

           authority to take appropriate action after giving an opportunity of

           hearing to the petitioner and to take a decision about continuation of

           the petitioner's services at the end of completion of the period of

           contract.
</p>
<p id="p_5">        5. It is also made clear that the observations made in the preceding

           paragraphs of this order shall not be construed in favour of either

           parties and any action or proceeding initiated against the petitioner,

           after issuance of show cause notice against her, shall be decided

           strictly in accordance with its own merits and law.

</p><p id="p_6">        6. The writ petition is allowed to the extent indicated above.
