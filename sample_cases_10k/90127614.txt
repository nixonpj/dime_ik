                            Writ Petition No.10250/2014




5.5.2015.
                   Shri A.K. Singh, learned counsel for the petitioners.
                   Heard on admission.
                   Petitioners, by way of present petition, seek following
            reliefs :
                   "1. To direct the respondents to regularize the</pre>
<p id="p_1">                   services of the petitioners in view of decision in
                   Gopal Chawla's case on the post of Samvida Shala
                   Shikshak Grade-III and absorb the services of
                   petitioners in Adhyapak Samvarg (as Sahayak
                   Adhyapak) from Shiksha Karmi-III (Guruji) as per
                   the recommendation of Shri D.P. Dubey Committee
                   and pay them the consequential benefits as has
                   been given to the Gurujis of Janpad Panchayat like
                   District Ratlam on 01.10.2012.
</p><p id="p_2">                   2.    Petitioners be given the benefit of
                   regularization/seniority and regular pay-scale of
                   Guruji/Shiksha Karmi Grade-III/Samvida Shala
                   Shikshak Grade-III after completion of 3 years
                   services as Guruji with all consequential benefits
                   from the date of their appointment.
</p><p id="p_3">                   3.    Any other relief/order or direction, as this
                   Hon'ble Court deem fit and proper looking to the
                   facts and circumstances of the case"
</p>
<p id="p_4">                   However, it is borne out from the record that the
            petitioners have already been absorbed as Sahayak Adhyapaks,
            therefore, the claim put forth by the petitioners that they be
            considered for absorption as Samvida Shala Shikshak Grade-III
            has no force.

<p id="p_6">                   Writ Petition No.10250/2014




         It is however contended by learned counsel for petitioners
that the fixation of pay as Sahayak Adhyapak ought to have
been from the initial date of appointment as Guruji. In the
considered opinion of this Court, the contention has no legal
force.
</p><p id="p_7">         A Cadre Varishtha Adhyapak/Adhyapak/Sahayak Adhyapak
were brought in vogue vide Madhya Pradesh Adhyapak Samvarg
(Employment and Conditions of service) Rules 2008. Whereunder
Rule 5 stipulates the selection and method of appointment in
Adhyapak Samvarg.
</p><p id="p_8">         Sub-Rule (2) of Rule 5 stipulates-
</p><p id="p_9">               "5(2)- The Samvida Shala Shikshak shall be
         appointed on the relevant post of the "Adhyapak
         Samvarg" under the following conditions:
         (1) In the Adhyapak Samvarg such Samvida Shala
         Shikshak shall be appointed who have completed the
         three years contract appointment period and have
         found eligible as per the norms fixed by the scrutiny
         committee constituted to consider the eligibility for
         appointment in Adhyapak Samvarg.
</p><p id="p_10">         (2) Samvida Shala Shikshak Grade I shall be
         appointed as Varishth Adhyapak Samvida Shala
         Shikshak Grade II as Adhyapak and Samvida Shala
         Shikshak Grade III as Sahayak Adhyapak respectively
         on minimum of the pay scale of Adhyapak Samvarg.
         The date of next increment shall be after completion
         of one year service.

      (3) In Adhyapak Samvarg such Samvida Shala
      Shikshak shall be appointed who have acquired the
      educational and teaching/training qualification as
      prescribed in Column (3) of Schedule II.
      (4)    A committee shall be constituted known as
      scrutiny committee for the appointment of Adhyapak
      Samvarg which shall consists of the following persons:

             3- District Education Officer/Assistant Commissioner
             Tribal Welfare - Member Secretary
             4- One Officer from the Schedule Caste/Schedule Tribe
             Category - Member

      Furthermore, Rule 2(d) defines qualification to mean the
qualification of Adhyapak Samvarg specified in Schedule II.
</blockquote><p id="p_13">Whereas, Rule 6 defines promotion                 that appointment      on
promotion shall be made through departmental promotion
committee constituted and specified in Schedule IV. Qualification
for appointment/promotion of Sahayak Adhyapak as stipulated in
Schedule II is that an incumbent must have passed Higher
Secondary Certificate or equivalent and B.T.C.D/D.Ed/D.S.E. It
further stipulates that-

                 Education from any recognized Institution in addition
                 to Higher Secondary Certificate Examination."
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_6">                 In the case at hand, petitioners initially engaged as Guruji
        appointed under the Education Guarantee Scheme; and, in
        absence of cogent material document to establish that the
        petitioners were entitled for regularization as Samvida Shala
        Shikshak Grade III from the initial date of their appointment, no
        indulgence is caused.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_7">                 Consequently, petition fails and is dismissed in limine. No
        costs.</blockquote><pre id="pre_2">
