<div class="doc_title">Indore Development Authority vs Pradeep on 12 November, 2018</div><pre id="pre_1">              THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH
                         M.P. No. 5396/2018
1        Indore Development Authority V/s. Pradeep Deshpande

Indore, dated : 12.11.2018
             Ms. M. Ravindran, learned counsel for the petitioner.
             Heard on the question of admission.
                             ORDER
</pre><p id="p_1">             The petitioner, Indore Development Authority, has filed
the present petition being aggrieved by order dated 1.9.2018 passed
by 2nd Civil Judge, Class-I, Indore in Civil Suit No.9-A/2015 by
which the objection in respect of demarcation report has been
turned down.
</p><p id="p_2">2.           Respondent being the plaintiff has filed the suit for
declaration and permanent injunction. According to the plaintiff, he
is owner of land bearing Survey No.510/3/4/1 admeasuring 0.054
Hect. by virtue of sale-deed dated 30.3.2008. The petitioner issued
NIT dated 6.6.2015 for allotment of casual shops and the land for
PSP use. According to the plaintiff, the present petitioners have
included his land in the said project which gave him cause of action
to file the suit.
</p><p id="p_3">3.           Present petitioners filed their written statement by
submitting that the land bearing Survey No.509/2 admeasuring
2.289 Hect. was acquired after following due process and thereafter,
requisite sanction and permissions from the statutory authorities
have been obtained. The allegation of the plaintiff in respect of
inclusion of his land is baseless and the suit is misconceived.
</p><p id="p_4">4.           Plaintiff filed an application under Order 39 Rule 1 &amp; 2,
C.P.C. which has been allowed vide order dated 30.6.2017 by the
trial Court. Against the said order, petitioners preferred an appeal in
              THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH
                          M.P. No. 5396/2018
2       Indore Development Authority V/s. Pradeep Deshpande

which vide order dated 24.10.2017, learned appellate Court has
held that the controversy between the parties can only be resolved
by demarcation of suit land as well as land of the defendant.
Learned appellate Court has directed the plaintiff to file an
appropriate application for demarcation before argument on the
application for temporary injunction.
</p><p id="p_5">5.         The aforesaid order was challenged by the plaintiff
before this Court in M.P. No.261/2018 and vide order dated
4.5.2018, said petition was disposed with a liberty to the plaintiff to
file a fresh application as per law.
</p><p id="p_6">6.         In compliance of the aforesaid order, learned trial Court
called the demarcation report and in compliance thereof,
Commissioner inspected the spot in presence of the plaintiff and
submitted the report on 17.4.2018. The operative part of the report
is reproduced below :

<p id="p_7">7.         Being aggrieved by the aforesaid report, present
petitioners submitted an objection. Vide impugned order dated
1.9.2018, learned trial Court has turned down the objection and
fixed the case for arguments on application for temporary
injunction, hence the present petition before this Court.
</p><p id="p_8">8.         Ms. M. Ravindran, learned counsel for the petitioner, has
vehemently argued that learned Additional District Judge vide order
dated 24.10.2017 has observed that the land of plaintiff as well as of
the defendant are liable to be demarcated before considering the
application for temporary injunction. The Commissioner has only
undertaken the demarcation of plaintiff's land and gave the report,
whereas, it was obligatory on his part to demarcate the land of
defendants also, therefore, such a report is not liable to be
considered by the trial Court.
</p><p id="p_9">9.         During the course of arguments, learned counsel for the
petitioner submitted that the present petitioners have also filed an
application seeking demarcation of their land, but the said
application has been turned down and such order has not been
challenged so far.
</p><p id="p_10">10.        Plaintiff applied for demarcation of his land and the
learned trial Court has directed the Commissioner to submit the
report. He cannot apply for demarcation of petitioner's land. Even
otherwise, before demarcation, notices were issued to the present
                       THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH
                                  M.P. No. 5396/2018
         4       Indore Development Authority V/s. Pradeep Deshpande

         petitioners also, but as per 'Panchnama' report dated 22.2.2018,
         representative of the petitioner neither appeared nor raised any
         objection on subsequent dates, therefore, learned trial Court has
         rightly rejected the objection raised by the petitioner.
</p><p id="p_11">         11.        Apart from the above, learned trial Court is yet to
         consider the report while deciding the application for temporary
         injunction. The petitioners may raise all objections at the time of
         arguments on application for temporary injunction and thereafter,
         either parties would be having remedy of appeal. Hence, at this
         stage, no interference is called for.
</p><p id="p_12">         12.        Accordingly, this petition fails and is hereby dismissed.
</p><p id="p_13">                    No order as to costs.
</p>
