      PER COURT   :- 


</pre><p id="p_1">     1.      The grievance of the petitioner in the present petition 

     is about non-payment to the petitioner of dependant's family 

     pension from 30.11.2013.  Notice was issued by this Court on 

     12.10.2017.  In response to the notice, initially an affidavit-in-

     reply was filed on behalf of Respondent No.1 through  Shri. 

     Pawan   Mehta,  under  Secretary   in   the   Ministry  of  Home 

     Affairs,   Freedom   Fighters  and   Rehabilitation  Division,  New 

     Delhi.  Perusal of this reply shows that the matter was under 

     consideration.     The   Petition   is   now   circulated   claiming 

     urgency.

</p><p id="p_4">     2.      The learned counsel Mr. Bhushan Kulkarni submitted 

     that the additional affidavit on behalf of Respondent No.1 is 

     ready and he be permitted to file the same in the office.  The 

     learned  counsel   for   the   petitioner   submits   that   copy   of 

     additional affidavit is provided to the learned counsel for the 

     petitioner.     On   perusal   of   this   additional   affidavit-in-reply, 

     certain facts are revealed that the pension was sanctioned to 

     the husband of the petitioner late Shri. Ramrao Shinde as 

     per the communication dated 03.03.2011 till death of Shri. 

     Ramrao   Shinde   i.e.   on   30.11.2013.   Shri.   Ramrao   Shinde 

     joined  the  pension under  the  Swatantrata  Sainik  Samman 

     Pension   Scheme.     The   petitioner,   after   demise   of   the 

     husband, approached the Ministry for dependent's pension 

     but  no documents  or any other material was submitted to 

     the   authorities.   As   such,   the   Ministry   forwarded   a 

     communication   to  submit   necessary   documents.     It   seems 

     that certain documents were submitted to the authority and 

     those were incomplete documents as such the Ministry again 

     forwarded   communication   to   the   petitioner   to   submit 

     complete documents so as to do the needful in the matter.


</p><p id="p_5">     3.      The   Additional   affidavit-in-reply   further   states   that 

     though  the petitioner  was requested  to  forward the  papers

     through   CPPC,   State  Bank   of   India   by  the   communication 

     dated 24.06.2015, the petitioner forwarded these documents 

     through   State   of   Maharashtra   and   one   copy   was   directly 

     forwarded to the Ministry.   This being the factual position, 

     the   Ministry   was   unable   to   take   steps   as   the   necessary 

     documents were not with the Ministry.   Again the Ministry 

     forwarded   communication   to   the   petitioner   to   submit 

     complete documents through CPPC, State Bank of India vide 

     a   communication   dated   21.06.2016.     A   statement   made   in 

     the   additional   affidavit-in-reply   that   during   the   course   of 

     time the case of petitioner for dependent's pension has been 

     considered by the answering respondent after receipt of all 

     requisite documents in terms of Swatantrata Sainik Samman 

     Pension Scheme. 
</p>
<p id="p_6">
</p><p id="p_7">     4.      It is further stated in the additional affidavit-in-reply 

     that   the   respondents   have   decided   to   allow   the   grant   of 

     dependent's family pension to the petitioner and the pension 

     of the petitioner has now been approved.   A  communication 

     dated   12.01.2018   is   also   placed   on   record   along   with   the 

     affidavit-in-reply.     The   learned   counsel   appearing   for   the 

     petitioner   submits   that   though   this   communication   states 

     that   the   Ministry   decided   to   grant   dependent's  family

     pension to the petitioner, it then refers to a further rider that 

     the petitioner will not be entitled for arrears of pension for 

     the gap period after the death of her husband and till the 

     approval of the dependent's family pension.  The submission 

     of   the   counsel   of   the   petitioner   is   as   the   grievance   and 

     monitory   claim   raised   by   the   petitioner   still   subsists,  this 

     communication dated 12.01.2018 is of no consequence.
