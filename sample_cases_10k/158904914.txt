the H.R.Circular dated 30.12.2009 as at Annexure-B

and the Corporate Circular dated 01.09.2011 as at

</p><p id="p_3">     3.   Learned     Advocates     appearing   for   the

respondents submitted that W.P.No.15737/2012 filed

by the B.H.E.L. Electro Porcelains Division Employees

Association (BHEL-EPD) assailing the Circular as at

Annexure-C, was disposed of by the order dated

be disposed of accordingly.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                -4-</span><p id="p_4">




</p><p id="p_5">     4. In W.P.No.15737/2012, the Circular as at

Annexure-C,     by   which,     for   computation   of   E.L.

encashment amount and half pay leave 30 days month

was adopted in place of 26 days month by the

Management of BHEL was assailed by the Employees'

Association as well as three other employees.            The

petitions   filed   by   the   individual   employees    were

dismissed as withdrawn on 18.01.2013 and 21.08.2013

respectively. As a consequence, only the Employees'

Association remained on record as the sole petitioner.

In the said context, it was held that the petition cannot

be maintained by the Employees' Association alone.

That apart, the pendency of an industrial dispute was

also noticed and the petition was disposed of by

reserving liberty to the aggrieved persons, if any, to seek

remedy, if so advised on termination of the dispute

pending before the Industrial Tribunal.
