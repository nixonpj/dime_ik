                         ORDER
</pre>

<p id="p_1">     This criminal revision petition under Section 397

r/w 401 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_1">Cr.P.C</a>. is filed challenging the judgment of

conviction   and   sentence         dated   30.3.2009   in

C.C.No.905/2007 on the file of Prl. Civil Judge(Jr.Dn.)

and JMFC, Tumkur convicting the petitioner-accused

for the offences punishable under <a href="/doc/1270101/" id="a_2">Sections 279</a>, <a href="/doc/1371604/" id="a_3">304-A</a>

of IPC r/w 134(a) and (b) of <a href="/doc/785258/" id="a_4">M.V. Act</a>, which has been

confirmed by the Fast Track Court, Tumkur in

Crl.A.No.46/2009     by     order   dated   9.3.2010    by

dismissing the appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">     2. The facts which gave rise to this petition are

briefly stated as under:-
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                   3</span><p id="p_4">




</p><p id="p_5">       On   25.2.2007, deceased Muddarangaiah               was

standing by the side of the road at about 4.30 p.m.

near Balanjeneya Temple, Kadugujjanahalli, Korategere

Taluk. At that time, a lorry bearing No.MYS 7352

driven by its driver-accused/revision petitioner came in

rash    and       negligent    manner and     dashed   against

Muddurangaiah and as a result, he sustained grievous

injuries      and      while     undergoing     treatment    at

Government hospital, Tumkur, he was declared dead. A

complaint came to be lodged against the driver of the

lorry. The police after investigation filed charge-sheet

against the driver of the lorry for the offences

punishable under <a href="/doc/1270101/" id="a_5">Section 279</a>, <a href="/doc/1371604/" id="a_6">304-A</a> of IPC r/w

<a href="/doc/58059807/" id="a_7">Section 134(a)</a> and (b) of <a href="/doc/785258/" id="a_8">M.V. Act</a>. The accused having

denied      the     charges     levelled   against   him,   the

prosecution in order to prove the charges examined as

many as nine witnesses as PWs-1 to 9 and marked Ex-
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                             4</span>


P1 to P10. The accused denied all the incriminating

circumstances that appeared in the evidence of the

prosecution witnesses during his examination under

<a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_9">Section 313</a> of Cr.P.C. He did not choose to lead

defence evidence. As such, the learned Magistrate upon

hearing the counsel for both the parties and upon

perusal of the evidence placed on record by the

judgment dated 30.3.2009 convicted the accused for

the aforesaid offences and sentenced him to undergo

imprisonment. Aggrieved by the judgment of conviction

and sentence, the accused preferred Crl.A.No.46/2009

on the file of Fast Track Court-II at Tumkur, which

came to be dismissed on merits by order dated

9.3.2010, confirming the judgment of conviction and

sentence   passed by the Magistrate. Questioning the

legality and correctness of the orders passed by both

the Courts below, this revision petition is preferred.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                             5</span>


</p><p id="p_6">     I have heard both the learned counsel appearing

for the revision petitioner/accused and the HCGP

appearing for the respondent State. Perused the

records.
</p>
<p id="p_7">
</p><p id="p_8">     3. The counsel for the revision petitioner-accused

would submit that though the identity of the accused

as the driver of the lorry is not established, he has been

convicted by the learned Magistrate, which has been

confirmed by the Sessions Judge without proof of the

same beyond reasonable doubt. It is also submitted

that there was no negligence on the part of the driver of

the lorry in question. On the other hand, the accident

occurred due to negligence of the deceased himself.

Hence, the learned counsel sought to set-aside the

judgment of sentence.
</p>
<p id="p_9">
</p><p id="p_10">     4. Per-contra, learned HCGP appearing for the

respondent-State    submitted    before   me   that   the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                             6</span>


accident was seen by the eye-witnesses to the accident,

who are examined as PW-1 to PW-4 and all of them

have spoken in their evidence that the accident and the

resultant death of the deceased is due to rash and

negligent driving by the accused -driver of the lorry.

Based on the evidence of the eye-witnesses, the learned

Magistrate has rightly convicted the accused for the

offences punishable under <a href="/doc/1270101/" id="a_10">Sections 279</a>, <a href="/doc/1371604/" id="a_11">304-A</a> of IPC

and <a href="/doc/145949/" id="a_12">Sections 13(a)</a> and <a href="/doc/145949/" id="a_13">13(b)</a> of M.V. Act, which has

been rightly conformed by the Sessions Judge. There is

no merit in this appeal and hence he sought for

dismissal of the revision petition.
</p>
<p id="p_11">
</p><p id="p_12">     5. A perusal of the records secured from the

Magistrate discloses that in order to prove the charges

levelled against the accused persons, the prosecution

has examined in all nine witnesses as PW-1 to 9. PW-1

Laxmikantha is nephew of deceased Muddurangaiah.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                              7</span>


His evidence is that on 25.2.2007, he alongwith

deceased and about 30 to 40 persons had been to

Bylanjeneyaswamy temple in order to perform pooja

and other rituals in a tempo. After performing the

rituals and after having lunch, the deceased was

waiting by the side of the road for the tempo to return

back at about 4.00 p.m. At that time, the lorry in

question came from Seethakal side in rash and

negligent manner and dashed against the deceased-

Muddurangaiah, while he was standing on the left side

of the road and as a result, he fell down and the wheel

of the lorry ran over the chest and thereby he died on

the way to the Government hospital at Tumkur. He has

also   spoken   that   at   the   time   of   the   accident,

Laxmamma-the wife of the deceased and the children

were also there at the spot. He has also spoken about

having given a complaint before the jurisdictional police

as per Ex-P1. A suggestion made to him in the cross-
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                             8</span>


examination that he has not seen the accident and he

does not know about the accident has been denied by

him. A suggestion made to him that the deceased was

standing in the middle of the road is also denied by

him. He has clearly spoken about the registration

number of the lorry as MYS-7253 by name "Sri

Lakshmivenkateshwara". He has also made it clear that

after the accident, the driver stopped the lorry and after

getting down from the lorry, he ran away and at that

time, he had seen the driver, who is accused before the

Court. Thus, there is nothing in the cross-examination

of PW-1 so as to disbelieve him. PW-3 Rajashekara

was also one of the persons, who had come to

Bylanjeneya swamy temple at the same time alongwith

the deceased and others. He has also given evidence in

the same manner as that of PW-1. He has made it clear

that immediately after the accident, the lorry driver

stopped the lorry at a little distance and went away.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                           9</span>


PW-10 has also given the correct lorry number in his

evidence. Further his evidence would go to show that

one Girish nephew of PW-1 were also there at the spot

at the time of accident. Thus PW-2 another evidence

has also supported the case of the prosecution. PW-3

Girish is yet another eye-witness, whose evidence is

that after performing the pooja at Bylanjaneya temple,

he was sitting by the side of the road under a tree and

deceased was waiting for the tempo by the side of the

road. At that time, a lorry came and dashed against

him causing his death. Though he has been cross-

examined, nothing has come out of it so as to enure the

benefit of the accused. PW-3 is also none other the

another son of the deceased. PW-4 is Somashekar, who

is the pancha to the spot panchanama,but he has

turned hostile to the case of the prosecution. Though

he has been cross-examined, nothing has come out of

it. PW-5 is a head constable working in Kyathasandra
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                             10</span>


police station within whose jurisdiction the accident

has occurred. His evidence is that while he was a

Station House Officer in the said police station , PW-1

came and gave complaint as per Ex-P1 and thereby he

registered the case and forwarded FIR as per Ex-P6 to

the jurisdictional Magistrate. PW-6 is the ASI of

Kyathasandra police station, who has spoken about

further   investigation   conducted   by   him.   PW-7

H.N.Dharmendra, CPI of Kyathasandra police station

took up further investigation from PW-6-ASI and after

completion of the investigation, he has filed charge-

sheet against the accused-driver of the lorry. PW-8 is

one Manjunath the pancha to the spot panchnama. He

has turned hostile to the prosecution case.PW-9 is the

owner of the lorry which caused the accident. But so

far as the driver is concerned, he states that he does

not know who was driving the lorry at the time of

accident, but, he has admitted that by producing the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                            11</span>


documents pertaining to the lorry, he got it released.

Further, he has admitted that the lorry was brought

from the police station by the accused.


</p><p id="p_13">     6. Thus all the eye-witnesses have supported the

case of the prosecution. Since they are interested

witnesses being the relatives, the learned Magistrate

has appreciated their evidence with due care and

caution. Their evidence does inspire the confidence of

the Court. Since all of them alongwith deceased had

been to temple to perform pooja on a tempo and after

performing pooja, they were waiting for a tempo to

return to their village, the lorry came and dashed to the

deceased causing his death. Not only that, it is evident

from their evidence that the lorry driver instead of

informing police or giving medical treatment to the

injured ran away from the spot. Apart from oral

evidence, all the necessary documents have also been
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                           12</span>


taken into consideration by the Magistrate. Ex-P4 is

the post-mortem report of the deceased which speaks

about the injuries sustained by the deceased both

external and internal and opined that the death is due

to shock and haemorrhage as a result of multiple

injuries to vital organs. Even otherwise, the death of

the deceased is due to motor accident is not in dispute.

What is disputed is the identity of the accused as the

driver of the said lorry. All these eye-witnesses have

stated that the accused was the driver of the lorry and

immediately after the accident, he got down from the

lorry and ran away. The owner of the lorry, who has

been examined stated that after he got released the

lorry to his interim custody, it was brought back by the

accused from the police station. All these factors taken

into consideration coupled with the evidence placed on

record, it appears to be that the Magistrate has

convicted the accused for the offences punishable
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                            13</span>


under <a href="/doc/1270101/" id="a_14">Section 279</a>, <a href="/doc/1371604/" id="a_15">304-A</a> of IPC on proper appreciation

of the evidence on record. Not only that, the learned

Sessions Judge also on re-appreciation of the evidence

confirmed the judgment and the sentence passed by

the learned Magistrate. The sentence imposed by the

Magistrate for the offence punishable under <a href="/doc/1371604/" id="a_16">Section

304-A</a> of IPC for a period of six months is also proper

having regard to the gravity of the charge. I do not find

any merit in this revision petition. Hence, criminal

revision petition is dismissed.
