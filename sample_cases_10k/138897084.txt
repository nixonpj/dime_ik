     JUDGMENT:
</pre>   



<p id="p_1">     1)               The appeal is filed to challenge the judgment and

     decree of Regular Civil Suit No. 261/1983, which was pending in





     the Court of Civil Judge, Senior Division, Kopargaon, District

     Ahmednagar and also against the judgment and decree of

     Regular Civil Appeal No. 127/1989, which was pending in the





     Court of 3rd Additional District Judge, Ahmednagar. Both the

     sides are heard.
</p>


<p id="p_2">     2)               The suit was filed for redemption of mortgage in

     respect of house property bearing No. 303 situated at Shirdi,




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">    ::: Uploaded on - 18/04/2016                         ::: Downloaded on - 29/07/2016 21:15:10 :::</span>

     Tahsil Kopargaon, District Ahmednagar. The size and boundaries

     of the property are given in the plaint by the respondent,




                                                 
     plaintiff. It is his case that the property was mortgaged for

     consideration of Rs. 9500/- to the defendant. Two documents




                                                
     were executed by plaintiff in favour of defendant, dated

     16.4.1970 and 13.7.1970 and under those documents, total




                                      
     amount of Rs. 9500/- was taken as loan and the property was

     mortgaged. It is contended that it was mortgage transaction and
                             
     so, plaintiff was entitled to get the redemption of mortgage, but
                            
     the defendant is not ready to return back the possession of the

     property by accepting loan amount. The suit was filed on

     25.2.1983.
</p>      
   



<p id="p_3">     3)               The defendant filed written statement and contested

     the matter. The defendant first contended that there was no





     relationship as creditor and debtor between plaintiff and

     defendant. Alternatively, defendant contended that he was

     required to spend Rs. 4,000/- for repairs of one wall and plaintiff





     is bound to give that amount also. Defendant contended that

     plaintiff needs to give Rs. 9500/-, the loan amount and the

     amount of Rs. 4,000/- spent by defendant on repairs and only

     after that relief of redemption of mortgage can be given.

</p><p id="p_5">     4)                  Issues were framed on the basis of aforesaid

     pleadings. Both the sides gave evidence. Copies of aforesaid two




                                                   
     documents were produced on the record. In view of the contents

     of the document and aforesaid pleading and nature of evidence,




                                                  
     both the Courts below have held that the transaction was of

     mortgage by conditional sale. Both the Courts below have held




                                         
     that the defendant failed to prove that he spent Rs. 4,000/- on

     repairs and plaintiff is liable to pay that amount also.

<p id="p_6">     5)                  When this Court admitted appeal on 9.2.1992, no

     substantial question of law as such was framed. Learned Senior

     Counsel Shri. V.D. Hon appearing for appellants submitted that
      


     following substantial questions of law need to be formulated.
</p>   



<p id="p_7">                   (i)      Whether the Courts below have committed error

                   in construing documents and by holding that the





                   transaction was of mortgage by conditional sale ?
</p>
<p id="p_8">                   (ii)     Whether the Courts below have committed error

                   in not considering the material and whether the





                   defendant has proved that he was required to spend

                   Rs. 4,000/- on repairs ?
</p>
<p id="p_9">                   (iii)    Whether after expiry of period of 10 years, the

                   defendant had become owner in view of the language

                   of two documents ?

     documents were produced on the record and they are at Exhs.

<p id="p_12">     22 and 23. In the first document dated 16.4.1969, there is




                                      
     mention that the suit property was given in possession of

     defendant under the transaction of conditional sale. The
                             
     document was also titled as conditional sale. The period of 10
                            
     years was fixed during which the defendant was to enjoy the

     property and during which the plaintiff was to return the amount

     after giving six months notice. In this document, there is
      


     mention that the plaintiff had agreed to make the construction of
   



     southern wall which was in dilapidated condition at his own cost.
</p>
<p id="p_13">     Exh. 23, the second document was also titled as conditional sale





     deed (but it was also specifically mentioned that it was

     mortgage deed). Additional amount was accepted by plaintiff,

     mortgagor, but the other conditions were kept intact. In the body





     of the document also, it was specifically mentioned that it was

     mortgage transaction and during the period fixed in the previous

     document, the amount (Rs. 9500/-) was to be returned by the

     mortgagor.
