Rekha Mittal, J.
</pre>
<p id="p_1">            The appellant prays for setting aside order dated 22.02.2013,

dismissing his writ petition and upholding the appointment of respondent

No. 2 (Geeta Devi) as Lambardar of village Garhi Patti Hodal, Tehsil Hodal,

District Palwal (Haryana).
</p>
<p id="p_2">            Counsel for the appellant submits that the selected candidate

did not own any land in the revenue estate of village Garhi Patti Hodal,

Tehsil Hodal, District Palwal, at the time, when she submitted an

application in response to the proclamation, for filing up the vacancy of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1"> LPA No. 555 of 2013 (O&amp;M)                                            2</span>


Lambardar of the village. It is further argued that she purchased four acres

of land later in order to make herself eligible for appointment to the post of

Lambardar. It is submitted that as respondent No. 2 was ineligible, on the

day she submitted application, her appointment as Lambardar, by the

District Collector, Palwal, may be set aside. It is further argued that the

Commissioner, Gurgaon Division, Gurgaon rightly set aside the order

passed by the District Collector, Palwal and held in favour of the appellant

but the Financial Commissioner wrongly set aside the order of the

Commissioner, and restored the choice made by the District Collector,

Palwal.
</p>
<p id="p_3">            We have heard counsel for the appellant, perused the impugned

order, orders passed by revenue authorities and the paper book.

</p><p id="p_4">            Admittedly, the selected candidate was owner of the land in the

revenue estate of village Garhi Patti Hodal, Tehsil Hodal, District Palwal,

on the day, the matter was taken up for consideration by the District

Collector, Palwal and decided in favour of respondent No. 2, vide order

dated 18.01.2010. The relevant date for consideration of the merits and

demerits of contesting candidates is the day, on which, the case is taken up

by the appointing authority, for appraisal and appreciation as well as

adjudication of contesting claims. As respondent No. 2 was owner of the

land on that day, no fault can be found with the decision of the District

Collector, Palwal, restored by the Financial Commissioner, while setting

aside the order passed by the Commissioner. We would like to record that

owning of land in the revenue estate is not a qualification but a factor to be

taken into consideration.
</p>
<p id="p_5">            We find no error of law or of jurisdiction in the order passed by
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2"> LPA No. 555 of 2013 (O&amp;M)                                           3</span>


the District Collector, Palwal, duly affirmed by the Financial Commissioner

and in the writ petition.
</p>
<p id="p_6">             In view of what has been stated here-in-above, the appeal is

dismissed, leaving the parties to bear their own costs.
