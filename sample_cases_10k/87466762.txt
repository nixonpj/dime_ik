              (JAGAT SINGH Vs THE STATE OF MADHYA PRADESH)


18-01-2017</pre>

<p id="p_1">Shri B.P. Patel, counsel for applicant.
</p><p id="p_2">Shri Y. Dwivedi, P.L., for State.
</p><p id="p_3">This is first bail application moved under <a href="/doc/1290514/" id="a_1">section 439</a> of
Cr.P.C., for grant of regular bail on behalf of applicant Jagat
Singh in connection with crime No.234/2016 registered at
Police Station Kundam Distt. Jabalpur under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_2">section 302</a>/<a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_3">34</a> of
IPC.
</p><p id="p_4">It is submitted by learned counsel for applicant that the
prosecution case rests upon the circumstantial evidence.
There is no eye witness of the incident and only on the basis of
seizure of an axe on the memorandum of applicant, he has
been made accused. No blood stain has been found on the
axe. The applicant has been falsely implicated and he is in
custody since 20.10.2016. The investigation is over and the
charge sheet has been filed and therefore, the applicant may
be released on bail.
</p><p id="p_5">Learned Panel Lawyer for the State has vehemently opposed
the prayer and submitted that there was a dispute over money
between the applicant and deceased. Due to this enmity the
applicant alongwith co-accused had murdered the deceased.
The applicant is the main accused, who has assaulted the
deceased by an axe. The offence is of serious in nature and
therefore the applicant may not be released on bail.
Considering the fact that the prosecution case depends upon
circumstantial evidence, therefore, keeping in view the nature
of evidence available against the applicant and also the fact
 that the applicant is in jail since 20.10.2016, the investigation
is over and the charge sheet has been filed, therefore, without
expressing any opinion on the merits of the case, I find it
proper to release the applicant on bail. The application is
allowed. It is directed that the applicant Jagat Singh shall be
released on bail on his furnishing personal bond in the sum of
Rs.50,000/- (Rupees fifty thousand) with one solvent surety of
the like amount to the satisfaction of the trial Court. It is
directed that the applicant shall abide by the conditions as
enumerated under <a href="/doc/259682/" id="a_4">section 437(3)</a> of the Cr.P.C and in the
event of breach of condition of bail, the trial Court will be
competent to take coercive action against the applicant.
This M.Cr.C., stands allowed.
</p><p id="p_6">C.C. as per rules.
