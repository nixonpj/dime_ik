<p id="p_2">            The petitioners have filed this writ petition for the issuance of a

writ of certiorari for quashing the order dated 13.12.2010 passed by the Central

Administrative Tribunal, Chandigarh Bench, Chandigarh (hereinafter referred

to as "the Tribunal), dismissing the application of     Devi Shankar Sharma,

respondent-1   /applicant   for quashing    the impugned          order regarding
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2"> C.W.P.No. 7005 of 2011 (O&amp;M)                                -2-</span>


cancellation of the selection of the applicant as JE-II from the post          of

Technician Gr.I and reverting him to the post of Technician Gr.I.

</p><p id="p_3">            According to the applicant, he was working as Technician Gr.I

(T&amp;C) Fitter and was eligible for promotion as JE-II. A written test was held

on 14.9.2007 for filling up one post of JE-II, which was to be filled up from

Intermediate Apprentice Quota. He being eligible, applied for that post. The

written test was held on 14.9.2007 in which he did well and qualified. As per

the advance correction slip issued by the petitioners at the time of selection, 50

marks were earmarked for Proficiency Ability, 30 marks for record of service

and no marks were to be given regarding seniority. Without following that

criteria, the Selection Committee arbitrarily selected one Lal Chand by

awarding 20 marks for seniority. That selection being arbitrary and illegal, was

challenged before the Tribunal through O.A.No. 620/PB of 2008, which was

accepted, vide order dated 31.8.2009. A direction was issued by the Tribunal

to make this selection in the light of the observation made in the order and

appoint him as JE-II from the due date. That order was challenged by Lal

Chand by filing CWP No. 17108 of 2009, which was dismissed in limine on

14.12.2009. No further appeal was filed and, as such, that order has attained

finality. While implementing that order, panel of selection was amended and

his name was included in place of Lal Chand. Thereafter, he was deputed for

training for 18 months, which is required before appointment to the post of JE-

II. In pursuance of the order dated 3.2.2010, he submitted the joining report as

Trainee JE-II in Technical Training Centre at Patiala, on 14.2.2010.         He

was sent for further training to Supervisors Training Centre, Ajmer, vide order

dated 30.3.2010 and that training consisted of three sessions . He completed

the first session and thereafter, was getting the training during the second

session when he applied for leave from 2.8.2010 to 7.8.2010 to attend to his
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3"> C.W.P.No. 7005 of 2011 (O&amp;M)                                 -3-</span>


ailing wife, who was a cancer patient and was getting treatment from PGI,

Chandigarh. Notice dated 30.7.2010 was placed on the notice board of the

office to the effect that his selection as JE-II has been cancelled due to some

irregularities. Order dated 4.8.2010 was passed to initiate action to fill up the

said post of JE-II, by inviting 30 candidates, including himself, for written test.

In the application, he prayed for the following reliefs:-

             30.7.2010 (Annexure A-1 not served upon the applicant till date as

             it has been pasted at the Notice Board of the T.R.S. Shop at Patiala

             of the applicant and he has been arranged the copy of this order

             from his own sources)whereby the Selection Panel selecting the

             applicant as JE-II from the post of Technician-I has been cancelled

             and the applicant has been ordered to be reverted to the post of

             Technician -I, without serving any Show Cause Notice or granting

             any opportunity of being heard and also ignoring the fact that the

             applicant had already been sent on training by them for the of JE-

             30.7.2010, Annexure A-1, whereby the respondents have notified

             that a written test will be conducted for the post of JE-II(on which

             the applicant had been selected and sent for training) and names of

             30 candidates (including the name of the applicant) have been

             mentioned, who are invited/called for participating in the written

             the applicant and also by sending him to undergo the training of

             the said post at Ajmer, Rajasthan with a further direction to post

             him as JE-II after completion of the training, with all the

             consequential benefits."</blockquote><p id="p_4">

</p><p id="p_5">             The petitioners pleaded in their reply that a candidate is to be

promoted to the post of JE-II only after successful completion of the training

against 25% Intermediate Apprentice Quota and the applicant            has not

completed that training. One Partap Singh, who was also a candidate and had

also appeared in the general selection, along with the applicant, alleged that

certain irregularities   had been committed in the evaluation of the answer

sheets. After the case was examined in the light of those irregularities in the

evaluation of the answer sheets, the panel of selection of the applicant was

cancelled, vide notification dated 30.7.2010 and copy thereof, was sent to him

through post but he attempted to evade the service of that notice. Glaring

irregularities were found in the answer-sheets when those were scrutinized.

</p><p id="p_6">             After having heard learned counsel for the parties and going

through the record, the Tribunal quashed the order regarding the cancellation of

the selection of the applicant.
</p>
<p id="p_7">             We have heard learned counsel for both the sides.
</p>
<p id="p_8">             It was submitted by learned counsel for the petitioners, who

produced in Court the answer sheets of the candidates, who appeared in the

examination for promotion to the post of JE-II from Intermediate

Apprenticeship Quota, that a complaint was received that irregularities had

been committed in the evaluation of the answer sheets and after thorough

enquiry, it was found that the marks awarded for different questions had been

changed. It was in view of those irregularities that the selection process and

the consequent selection panel were cancelled and notification was issued for
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5"> C.W.P.No. 7005 of 2011 (O&amp;M)                                -5-</span>


holding the written test afresh.     The Tribunal       failed to appreciate the

irregularities, so committed and     as such,    order passed by it cannot be

sustained.
</p>
<p id="p_9">             We have carefully examined the answer sheets, which were so

produced by the counsel for the petitioners. It is a fact that some corrections

have been made in the marks, which were initially awarded for different

questions, but all those corrections were duly signed/initialled by the examiner.

In that eventuality, it cannot be held to be an irregularity. To err is human. The

examiner may make mistake while writing down the marks and it is within his

competence to correct the same. The position would have been different, if the

corrections made in those marks had not been initialled by the examiner. It was

rightly concluded by the Tribunal that under the Rules, the rechecking of the

answer sheets is not permissible and only recalculation of marks can be done.

It is pertinent to note that the margin of the increase/decrease of the marks,

while making the correction, is so small that the same need not be taken notice

of.
</p>
<p id="p_10">             We do not find any infirmity or illegality in the order of the

Tribunal. Accordingly, this writ petition is dismissed. Further no order is

made as to costs.
