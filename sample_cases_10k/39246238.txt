For Appellants       :       Shri AK Prasad, Advocate
For Respondents-State:       Shri Arvind Dubey, PL for the State


              Hon'ble Shri Justice Prashant Kumar Mishra
                Hon'ble Shri Justice Anil Kumar Shukla

                         Order On Board By

                      Prashant Kumar Mishra, J

22/11/2016

  1. Appellants have assailed the legality and validity of their

     conviction under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_1">Section 302</a> IPC and <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_2">Section 302</a>/<a href="/doc/112749/" id="a_3">114</a> IPC

     respectively, for which they have been sentenced to undergo life

     imprisonment and to pay a fine of Rs.1000/-. The charge is for

     committing murder of deceased Birbal at about 4PM on

     11-11-02.


  2. Facts</pre><p id="p_1"> of the case, briefly stated, are that Beerasai, Hirasai and

     Birbal     (deceased)   are     three   brothers.      The   accused

     No.1/appellant No.1 Brijlal is the son of Beerasai whereas
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                  2</span>

  accused No.4 Hirasai is one amongst the above named three

  brothers. Accused No.2 Lakhpati and accused No.3 Shesh Ram

  are the sons of Hirasai.       Land belonging to Beerasai was

  purchased by deceased Birbal in the name of her daughter-in-law

  PW-7 Mohmati, however, on allegation that Birbal has not paid

  the entire amount of consideration, Brijlal, S/o Beerasai was

  claiming that the land still belongs to them.


</p><p id="p_2">3. On the date and time of incident, deceased Birbal had brought

  paddy and was dumping the same in the threshing yard (Kothar)

  established on the disputed land. Brijlal raised objection as to

  why Birbal is dumping paddy over there, on which Birbal stated

  that he has already purchased the land and it belongs to him,

  therefore, he has every right to use the same. Hearing this,

  appellant Brijlal got enraged and while abusing the deceased he

  was about to charge on him. Seeing Brijlal coming towards him,

  deceased Birbal used "Silvas" (a kind of bamboo stick having

  sharp edges on both ends) to stop Birjlal, due to which Brijlal fell

  on the ground. Hearing the alarm/shout of Brijlal other accused

  persons namely appellant No.2 Hirasai, Shesh Ram and Lakhpati

  rushed to the place and Hirasai exhorted Brijlal to finish Birbal.

  Brijlal got up, positioned himself and inflicted one axe blow on the

  front part of right shoulder of deceased Birbal, on which he fell

  down and started bleeding profusely. The incident was said to

  be witnessed by PW-2 Fulbasiya, PW-3 Naphulan Bibi, PW-7
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                3</span>

  Mohamati, PW-9 Sadir Ali, PW-10 Ishhaq Ali &amp; PW-11 Jabir Ali.

  While PW-2 Fulbasiya is the wife of deceased and PW-7

  Mohamati is daughter-in-law of the deceased, the other

  eyewitnesses are the neighbors of the deceased.


</p><p id="p_3">4. The FIR (Ex-P/1) was lodged by PW-1 Ram Sai at about 19:00

  hours on the date of incident. The postmortem was conducted

  by PW-4 Dr. DK Vishwakarma, who submitted his report (Ex-P/4)

  stating that cause of death is shock due to haemorrhage (due to

  injury).   Nature of death is homicidal. Duration within 12-24

  hours.     After recording case-diary statements of witnesses,

  effecting seizure etc., the charge-sheet was filed against the

  above stated four accused persons alleging commission of

  offence under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_4">Section 302</a>/<a href="/doc/112749/" id="a_5">114</a> IPC.       While accused No.2

  Lakhpati and accused No.3 Shesh Ram have been acquitted of

  the charges, the present appellant No.1 Brijlal has been

  convicted under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_6">Section 302</a> IPC and appellant No.2 Hirasai has

  been convicted under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_7">Section 302</a> IPC with the aid of <a href="/doc/112749/" id="a_8">Section

  114</a> of IPC.
</p>
<p id="p_4">
</p><p id="p_5">5. Shri AK Prasad, learned counsel for the appellants would argue

  that there being material contradictions and omissions in the

  statements of eyewitnesses, the entire prosecution case has

  become doubtful, therefore, the appellants deserve to be

  acquitted.    He would submit that the neighbours are the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                 4</span>

  interested witnesses because PW-9 Sadir Ali is a witness in the

  sale deed executed by Beerasai in favour of PW-7 Mohamati.

  The other so called independent witnesses are members of

  family of PW-9 Sadir Ali, therefore, all of them have joined

  together to falsely implicate the accused persons.


</p><p id="p_6">6. Per contra, Shri Arvind Dubey, learned State counsel would

  support the impugned conviction on submission that all the

  witnesses have remained firm on the substantive prosecution

  case, therefore, minor contradictions or omissions, if any, would

  not frustrate the case of the prosecution. According to him, the

  present appellants' involvement in the crime is fully proved,

  therefore, the impugned judgment deserves to be upheld.


</p><p id="p_7">7. We have heard learned counsel for the parties at length and

  perused the record.
</p>
<p id="p_8">
</p><p id="p_9">8. The case of the prosecution rests on the statement of PW-2

  Fulbasiya, PW-3 Naphulan Bibi, PW-9 Sadir Ali, PW-10 Ishhaq

  Ali &amp; PW-11 Jabir Ali, while PW-2 Fulbasiya, PW-3 Naphulan Bibi

  and PW-9 Sadir Ali has attributed exhortion made by appellant

  No.2 Hirasai, the other witnesses PW-10 Ishhaq Ali &amp; PW-11

  Jabir Ali have only stated that Hirasai did nothing and was merely

  sitting at the place of incident. All the witnesses have stated that

  it was Brijlal who inflicted one axe blow on the front side of right

  shoulder on the person of deceased Birbal, therefore, the finding
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                            5</span>

         recorded by the trial Court that appellant Brijlal is guilty of

         causing fatal injury to the deceased is fully borne out from the

         record.
</p>
<p id="p_10">
</p><p id="p_11">      9. There may be some minor contradictions &amp; omissions in the

         statements of eyewitnesses, but there is no exaggeration which

         would negate their entire evidence so as to brand them as

         untrustworthy witness.
</p>
<p id="p_12">
</p><p id="p_13">10.      In Thoti Manohar Vs. State of Andhra Pradesh 1, the Supreme Court has

         held that minor discrepancies on trivial matters not touching the core of the

         matter cannot bring discredit to the story of the prosecution. Giving undue

         importance to them would amount to adopting a hyper-technical approach.

         The Court, while appreciating the evidence, should not attach much

         significance to minor discrepancies, for the discrepancies which do not

         shake the basic version of the prosecution case are to be ignored. {See

         State of U.P. Vs. M.K. Anthony2, Appabhai Vs. State of Gujarat3, Rammi

         Vs. State of M.P.4, State of H.P. Vs. Lekh Raj 5, Laxman Singh Vs.

         Poonam Singh6, Dashrath Singh Vs. State of U.P.7


</p><p id="p_14">11.      With the above findings, we are now required to consider as to

         what offence appellant Brijlal has committed in the given set of

         evidence.        Thus, we are required to consider as to, if the

         appellant had no intention or knowledge to commit culpable

         homicide of the deceased, what would be the actual offence

      committed by him and the commensurate             sentence which

      should be imposed on the appellant.
</p>
<p id="p_15">
</p><p id="p_16">12.   It is practically admitted position that both the factions have

      subsisting dispute for a piece of land owned by Beera Sai which

      was allegedly sold by way of sale deed in favour of PW-7

      Mohamati, however, the entire consideration has not been paid

      to Beerasai. With this background, when the incident took place,

      the appellant Brijlal and deceased started quarreling by hurling

      abuses.     Although appellant Brijlal initiated aggression by

      charging over the deceased on which he used Silvas to bring

      down appellant Brijlal on the ground, however, thereafter

      appellant Brijlal gave only one axe blow on the front side of right

      shoulder which is not vital part of the body. It is not the story of

      the prosecution that appellant Birjlal wanted to cause injury over

      the head of the deceased but somehow the injury was caused on

      the shoulder. On the contrary, when Brijlal inflicted the injury and

      the deceased fell down, Brijlal did not repeat the assault even

      though he had enough time to repeat the assault as other

      members of his family were available on the spot whereas Birbal

      was all alone.

                       ers acts done in a sudden fight. The said Excep-
                       tion deals with a case of prosecution not covered
                       by the First Exception, after which its place would
                       have been more appropriate. The Exception is
                       founded upon the same principle, for in both there
                       is absence of premeditation. But, while in the case
                       of Exception 1 there is total deprivation of self-
                       control, in case of Exception 4, there is only that
                       heat of passion which clouds men's sober reason
                       and urges them to deeds which they would not
                       otherwise do. There is provocation in Exception 4
                       as in Exception 1, but the injury done is not the di-
                       rect consequence of that provocation. In fact Ex-
                       ception 4 deals with cases in which notwithstand-
                       ing that a blow may have been struck, or some
                       provocation given in the origin of the dispute or in
                       whatever way the quarrel may have originated, yet
                       the subsequent conduct of both parties puts them
                       in respect of guilt upon an equal footing. A 'sudden
                       fight' implies mutual provocation and blows on
                       each side. The homicide committed is then clearly
                       not traceable to unilateral provocation, nor could in
                       such cases the whole blame be placed on one
                       side. For if it were so, the exception more appro-
                       priately applicable would be Exception 1. There is
                       no previous deliberation or determination to fight.
                       A fight suddenly takes place, for which both par-</blockquote><p id="p_20">

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                8</span>

one of them starts it, but if the other had not ag-
gravated it by his own conduct it would not have
taken the serious turn it did. There is then mutual
provocation and aggravation, and it is difficult to
apportion the share of blame which attaches to
each fighter. The help of Exception 4 can be in-
voked if death is caused (a) without premeditation,
</p><p id="p_22">(b) in a sudden fight, (c) without the offenders hav-
ing taken undue advantage or acted in a cruel or
unusual manner, and (d) the fight must have been
with the person killed. To bring a case within Ex-
ception 4 all the ingredients mentioned in it must
be found. It is to be noted that the 'fight' occurring
in Exception 4 to <a href="/doc/626019/" id="a_14">Section 300</a> IPC is not defined in
<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_15">IPC</a>. It takes two to make a fight. Heat of passion
requires that there must be no time for the pas-
sions to cool down and in this case, the parties
have worked themselves into a fury on account of
the verbal altercation in the beginning. A fight is a
combat between two and more persons whether
with or without weapons. It is not possible to enun-
ciate any general rule as to what shall be deemed
to be a sudden quarrel. It is a question of fact and
whether a quarrel is sudden or not must necessar-
ily depend upon the proved facts of each case.
For the application of Exception 4, it is not suffi-
cient to show that there was a sudden quarrel and
there was no premeditation. It must further be
shown that the offender has not taken undue ad-
vantage or acted in cruel or unusual manner. The
expression 'undue advantage' as used in the pro-
vision means 'unfair advantage'.
</p>
<p id="p_23">11. '19. Where the offender takes undue advan-
tage or has acted in a cruel or unusual manner,
the benefit of Exception 4 cannot be given to him.
If the weapon used or the manner of attack by the
assailant is out of all proportion, that circumstance
must be taken into consideration to decide
whether undue advantage has been taken. <a href="/doc/1113505/" id="a_16">In
Kikar Singh v. State of Rajasthan</a> it was held that if
the accused used deadly weapons against the un-
armed man and struck a blow on the head it must
be held that by using the blows with the knowl-
edge that they were likely to cause death he had
taken undue advantage. In the instant case blows
on vital parts of unarmed persons were given with

                           act was committed without premeditation, in a
                           sudden fight in the heat of passion upon a sudden

                           acts done in a sudden fight. The said Exception
                           deals with a case of prosecution not covered by
                           the First Exception, after which its place would
                           have been more appreciate. The Exception is
                           founded upon the same principle, for in both there
                           is absence of premeditation. But, while in the case
                           of Exception 1 there is total deprivation of self-
                           control, in case of Exception 4, there is only that
                           heat of passion which clouds men's sober reason
                           and urges them to deeds which they would not
                           otherwise do. There is provocation in Exception 4
                           as in Exception 1; but the injury done is not the di-
                           rect consequence of that provocation. In fact Ex-

                           whatever way the quarrel may have originated, yet
                           the subsequent conduct of both parties puts them
                           in respect of guilt upon equal footing. A 'sudden
                           fight' implies mutual provocation and blows on
                           each side. The homicide committed is then clearly

                       not traceable to unilateral provocation, nor in such
                       cases could the whole blame be placed on one
                       side. For if it were so, the exception more appro-
                       priately applicable would be Exception 1. There is
                       no previous deliberation or determination to fight.
                       A fight suddenly takes place, for which both par-
                       ties are more or less to be blamed. It may be that
                       one of them starts it, but if the other had not ag-
                       gravated it by his own conduct it would not have
                       taken the serious turn it did. There is then mutual
                       provocation and aggravation, and it is difficult to
                       apportion the share of blame which attaches to
                       each fighter. The help of Exception 4 can be in-
                       voked if death is caused; (a) without premedita-
                       tion; (b) in a sudden fight; (c) without the of-
                       fender's having taken undue advantage or acted
                       in a cruel or unusual manner; and (d) the fight
                       must have been with the person killed. To bring a
                       case within Exception 4 all the ingredients men-
                       tioned in it must be found. It is to be noted that the
                       word 'fight' occurring in Exception 4 to <a href="/doc/626019/" id="a_26">Section 300</a>
                       IPC is not defined in <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_27">IPC</a>. It takes two to make a
                       fight. Heat of passion requires that there must be
                       no time for the passions to cool down and in this
                       case, the parties have worked themselves into a
                       fury on account of the verbal altercation in the be-
                       ginning. A fight is a combat between two or more
                       persons whether with or without weapons. It is not
                       possible to enunciate any general rule as to what
                       shall be deemed to be a sudden quarrel. It is a
                       question of fact and whether a quarrel is sudden
                       or not must necessarily depend upon the proved
                       facts of each case. For the application of Excep-
                       tion 4, it is not sufficient to show that there was a
                       sudden quarrel and there was no premeditation. It
                       must further be shown that the offender has not
                       taken undue advantage or acted in a cruel or un-
                       usual manner. The expression 'undue advantage'
                       as used in the provision means 'unfair
                       advantage'."

                          glance, may lead to altercations and group
                          clashes culminating in deaths. Usual motives like
                          revenge, greed, jealousy or suspicion may be to-
                          tally absent in such cases. There may be no inten-

                          case that there was no intention to cause death. It
                          is for the courts to ensure that the cases of murder
                          punishable under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_34">Section 302</a>, are not converted

             "31. In Modi's Jurisprudence and Toxicology, 24th Edition,
             Chapter-26, the author has dealt with the topic causes of
             death from wounds. The following part of the chapter
             can be profitably referred:-
</p>
<p id="p_38">               "Causes               of         death          from                wounds.-

<p id="p_39">                .......................................................................................

                .......................................................................................

                .......................................................................................

                .......................................................................................

             It should be noted that a person could be convicted of
             culpable homicide, if he causes bodily injury to another
             who is labouring under a disorder, disease or bodily
             infirmity and thereby accelerates the death of that other
             person. However, the intention or the knowledge with
             which the act that caused death was committed in a
             necessary ingredient to bring about a conviction under
             these offences. In such a case, even if the medical officer
             has proved from post-mortem examination the existence
             of the disease that caused the death, and its relation to
             the injury alleged to have accelerated it, the court will
             have to be satisfied from the evidence before giving a
             decision:
</p>
<p id="p_40">             (a) that the death at the time when it occurred was not
             caused solely by the disease; and

</p><p id="p_41">             (b)that it was caused by the bodily injury to this extent that
             it was accelerated by such injury.
</p>
<p id="p_42">             32. Modi, thereafter, deals with the topic as to when
             causes of death from wounds are immediate or direct and
             remote or indirect. (i) haemorrhage (ii) injury of a vital
             organ and (iii) shock are considered as immediate or
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                                      15</span>

             direct causes of death. Haemorrahge is dealt with by Modi
             in the following manner:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_9">                     "Haemorrhage.- This may be external or internal.
                     External haemorrhage may produce marked fall of
                     blood pressure and consequent shock causing
                     death either rapidly, if a large blood vessel such as
                     the carotid or femoral artery has been wounded, or
                     slowly, if a number of small vessels have been
                     injured. The amount of haemorrhage required to
                     cause syncope varies according to circumstances.
                     The sudden loss of blood is more dangerous than
                     the same quantity lost slowly. The loss of one-
                     third of the blood of the body is almost enough to
                     cause death, and the total quantity of blood in the
                     body of an adult is on an average about five per
                     cent of the body weight of about 750 ml per 10 kg
                     of body weight. Children, women and old persons
                     die from the loss of much smaller quantity.

                     haemophiliacs may die of haemorrhage even from
                     a trifling injury."
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_11">                                                    Emphasis supplied



</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_12">19.   Modi's observation as to the cause of death from wounds as well

      as haemorrhage, when applied in the facts of the present case, in

      conjunction with the statement of PW-4 Dr. DK Vishwakarma, it

      may be concluded that the deceased has not died instantly on

      account of the injury but he has died after few hours on account

      of bleeding from the injury.

<p id="p_43">20.   Thus, it is a case where the appellant may had the knowledge

      that the deceased may die on account of the injury but he had no

      intention to kill the deceased. It is a case squarely falling under

      exception IV to <a href="/doc/626019/" id="a_39">Section 300</a> IPC and is punishable under <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_40">Section

      304-II</a> IPC.

</p><p id="p_45">       21.   In the result the appeal preferred by appellant No.1 Brijlal is

             allowed in part. His conviction under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_41">Section 302</a> IPC is set aside

             and instead he is convicted under <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_42">Section 304-II</a> IPC and

             sentenced to the period already undergone by him. The appeal

             preferred by appellant No.2 Hirasai succeeds and is allowed. His

             conviction under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_43">Section 302</a>/<a href="/doc/112749/" id="a_44">114</a> IPC is set aside and he is

             acquitted of the said charge. Both the appellants are on bail.

             Surety and personal bonds earlier furnished at the time of

             suspension of sentence shall remain operative for a period of six

             months in view of the provisions of <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_45">Section 437-A</a> Cr.P.C. The

             appellants shall appear before the higher Court as and when

             directed.
