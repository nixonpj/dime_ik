ORDER
</pre>

<p id="p_1">1.     Vide this order, I shall decide the application filed by the respondents

u/s 25­B of the Act, seeking leave to defend and contest the eviction petition

</p>
<p id="p_2">2.     Petitioner has filed present petition for eviction of respondents u/s 14

(1)    (e) of the <a href="/doc/679372/" id="a_1">Delhi Rent Control Act</a>, 1958.
</p>
<p id="p_3">3.     Briefly   stated,   the   relevant   contentions   of   the   petitioner   are   as

follows:­

</p><p id="p_4">a)     Respondents   are   tenant  in   respect   of   a tin­shed   (room)  along  with

latrine and bathroom   on the ground floor of house no. 6/240, measuring

113   sq.   yards,   Doonger   Mohalla,   Farsh   Bazar,   Shahdara,   Delhi­32.   This

</p><p id="p_5">b)     Respondents   have   not   paid   the   arrears   of   rent   despite   repeated

demands @ Rs. 60/­ p.m.

</p><p id="p_6">c)     The father  of the  petitioner namely Sh. Dayanand Sharma was the

owner of property bearing no. 6/238 and he executed a registered Will dated

15.11.2007,   thereby   bequeathing   his   properties   in   favour   of   Smt.   Padma


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">E­23/11                                                                      Page 2 of 7</span>
 Wati, who was the mother of the petitioner. Mother of the petitioner also

executed   a   registered   Will   dated   30.04.2003   thereby   bequeathing   her

immovable properties in favour of petitioner. Petitioner is owner of house

no. 6/238, which comprises of 3 rooms, open Courtyard, Kitchen, Latrine,

toilet and Chabootra. Two rooms of this property are under occupation of

other brother and their family of the petitioner and petitioner is residing in

the third floor along with his family i.e. his wife and two children. Petitioner

is not having sufficient accommodation in property no. 6/238 as his married

sisters   also   visit   him   and   take   shelter   in   the   night.   The   children   of   the

petitioner also can not study due to shortage of accommodation. Petitioner is

owner of property in question by virtue of a Will and the tenanted premises

is bonafide required by him for residence of himself and his family.

</p><p id="p_7">d)      Respondent   no.   5   had   filed   a   suit   no.   21/10   for   declaration   and

permanent injunction on 16.01.2012 which was rejected under Order 7 Rule

11 CPC vide order dated 12.08.2010. Hence, this petition.

</p><p id="p_8">4.      In application for leave to defend and affidavits, respondent nos.
1,3,4,5 and 6 have taken following pleas:­

</p><p id="p_9">a)      Petitioner   has   filed   false   petition   and   has   suppressed   the   true   and

material facts.
</p>
<p id="p_10">b)      Petitioner   has   nothing   to   do   with   the   property   in   question   as   the

respondents are the owners of this property.
</p>
<p id="p_11">c)      The property in question is situated in slum area and around more

than 40 years ago, father of the respondents came to reside in the property in


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">E­23/11                                                                              Page 3 of 7</span>
 question.   At   that   time,   no   person   came   forward   to   disclose   about   his

ownership   over   this   property.   The   father   of   respondents   enjoyed   this

property as owner without any interference in his peaceful enjoyment for

more than 40 years. He died in the year 2005 when the petitioner and his

family members came to know that the respondents have no paper relating

to this property and they started harassing them.
</p>
<p id="p_12">d)     Respondent no. 5 filed a case for permanent injunction against mother

of the petitioner, which is still pending in the Court.

</p><p id="p_13">5.     In the reply and counter affidavit the petitioner denied that father of

the respondents   resided   in  the property  in question as  owner or that  the

respondents   are   owners   of   property   in   question.   He   reiterated   the   order

passed by Civil Court in the suit for declaration and injunction, which was

filed by respondent no. 5 against his mother. He further pleaded about a

civil suit filed by father of the respondents for the repair of the tenanted

premises, which was dismissed by the Court. He also pleaded about bar of

limitation   in   respect   of   filing   of   present  application  for   leave   to   defend.

However, this objection of the petitioner was already decided by this Court

vide   order   dated   27.03.2012   thereby   holding   that   application   was   filed

within time.
</p>
<p id="p_14">6.     Petitioner filed photocopies of affidavits filed by respondents in the

Civil suit for declaration and injunction as well as copy of order passed in

that suit. He also filed copy of Will executed by his father as well as his

mother and legal notice as well as reply to the same. Petitioner also filed

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">E­23/11                                                                          Page 4 of 7</span>
 copy of plaint filed by respondent no. 5. Site plan of property no. 6/238 as

well as of property no. 6/240 was also filed on behalf of petitioner.

Findings:­

</p><p id="p_15">7.     I shall first deal with the requirement under <a href="/doc/367290/" id="a_2">Section 14</a> (1) (e) DRC

Act   to   seek   eviction   of   a   tenant.   Under   <a href="/doc/367290/" id="a_3">Section   14</a>   (1)   (e)   DRC   Act,

petitioner has to satisfy the following ingredients:­

</p><p id="p_16">            i) Petitioner has to be landlord as well as owner of the tenanted

               property.
</p>
<p id="p_17">            ii)  The premises should be required bona fide by the landlord for

               his occupation or for occupation of any member of his family

               dependent upon him. 
</p>
<p id="p_18">            iii) Landlord or such person dependent upon landlord should   not

               have other reasonable or suitable accommodation in Delhi.

</p><p id="p_19">8.      In the present case, respondents have disputed the existence of the

relationship   of   landlord   and   tenant   between   the   parties.   They   have   also

challanged the ownership title of the petitioner. It is necessary ingredient of

<a href="/doc/367290/" id="a_4">Section 14(1)(e)</a> of the Act that their exists a relationship of landlord and

tenant between the parties. Therefore, the dispute raised by the respondents

have to be analysed on merits. According to respondents, their father came

to reside in the property in question around 40 years ago and he resided in

this property as owner of the same as no one else came either to assert his

ownership title or to collect any rent. The respondents also claimed their

ownership over the property in question. On the other hand, petitioner has

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">E­23/11                                                                        Page 5 of 7</span>
 challenged   such   contention   of   the   respondents,   however,   either   in   the

petition or in the counter affidavit, petitioner has not disclosed the time of

letting out and the fact that who had let out the tenanted property to Late

Kanahiya Lal i.e. the father of the respondents. Petitioner has simply stated

that the property in question was let out to father of the respondents and

monthly  rent  is  Rs.  60/­  p.m. The counsel  for petitioner relied upon the

order passed in the civil suit for declaration and permanent injunction filed

by   respondent   no.   5   against   mother   of   the   petitioner.   Vide   order  passed

under   Order   7   Rule   11   CPC,   the   said   suit   of   respondent   no.   5   seeking

declaration of his ownership right over property in question was rejected by

the   Civil   Court.   However,   this   order   does   not   have   any   bearing   on   the

existence   of   a   relationship   of   landlord   and   tenant   between   the   parties.

Petitioner has claimed that his father Late Dayanand was the original owner

of   property   no.   6/238.   However,   the   property   in   question   is   bearing   no.

6/240 and petitioner has not placed any document on the record to show that

all such properties were owned by his father Pandit Dayanad. He has simply

filed copies of Will executed by his father as well as his mother. The denial

of ownership of the respondents over property in question by the Civil Court

does not  establish the ownership title of petitioner or his predecessor­in­

interest over the property in question. Such order of the Civil Court can have

only meaning to the effect that respondents are not the owners of property in

question.   However,   this   Court   has   to   be   convinced   about   existence   of

relationship of landlord and tenant between the parties as well as ownership

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">E­23/11                                                                         Page 6 of 7</span>
        title of the petitioner herein. I find that this question can not be decided in

       summary manner for want of sufficient pleading of the petitioner as well as

       non­disputed documents on the records, therefore, a trial is required to be

       conducted to find out the answer to aforesaid questions.

</p><p id="p_20">   9.        Therefore, the application for leave to defend is allowed.
