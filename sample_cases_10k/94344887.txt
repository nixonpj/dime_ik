CORAM : HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE B.S. WALIA

Present:      Mr. Dinesh Mahajan, Advocate for the petitioner.

              Mr. Lalit Garg, Advocate
              for respondent No.3/Insurance Company.

<p id="p_1">CM No.28227-CII of 2017

              For the reasons as are mentioned in the application, the same is

allowed. Delay of 67 days in late filing of the appeal is condoned, subject to all just

exceptions.
</p>
<p id="p_2">FAO No.8719 of 2017

[1]           Appeal has been filed against Award dated 15.03.2017, passed by

the learned Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal, Gurdaspur (hereinafter referred

to as the Tribunal) seeking enhancement of compensation of Rs.2,90,000/-

awarded alongwith interest @ 9% per annum on account of death of Puran

Kaur, mother of the appellant.
</p>
<p id="p_3">[2]           The learned Tribunal assessed monthly income of the deceased

housewife at Rs.6000/- and by imposing deduction of 1/3rd of the income of the

                                 1 of 4

deceased towards her personal expenses awarded total compensation of

Rs.2,90,000/- including Rs.50,000/- on account of loss of love and affection

and funeral expenses.
</p>
<p id="p_4">[3]           Learned counsel for the appellant contended that the income of

the deceased housewife was liable to be taken at Rs.9,000/- per month in view

of the decision of a Co-ordinate Bench of this Court in FAO No.218 of 2014,

decided on 15.01.2014 in case titled as 'United India Insurance Company

Limited versus Sube Singh and Others'. Secondly, that the deduction made

was not sustainable in view of the decision of a Division Bench of this Court

in 'Paramjit Singh and another versus Dilbagh Singh alias Bagga and

others', 2013(3) Law Herald 2730. Thirdly, that appropriate compensation

payable under the conventional heads had not been awarded.

[4]           Per contra, learned counsel for respondent No.3 contended that

Sube Singh's case (supra) was distinguishable as in said case, the deceased

housewife was 40 years of old, whereas in the instant case, the deceased

housewife was 68 years of age. Secondly, that no amount of compensation

was payable on account of loss of love and affection.

[5]           I have considered the submissions of learned counsel for the

parties.
</p>
<p id="p_5">[6]           Admittedly, the deceased housewife was 68 years of age.

Therefore, in the facts of the case, assessment of the notional contribution of

the deceased housewife towards the family at Rs.6000/- per month does not

warrant interference.       However, deduction made @ 1/3rd of the notional

contribution of the deceased towards her personal expenses is unsustainable in

the light of decision of a Division Bench of this Court in 'Paramjit Singh's

case (supra). However, no amount of compensation is payable on account of

decision in 'National Insurance Company Limited versus Pranay Sethi and

others', 2014(4) RCR (Civil) 1009, a sum of Rs.15,000/- is payable on account

of loss of estate, Rs.15,000/- on account of funeral expenses.                   Besides

Rs.40,000/- is payable on account of loss of parental consortium in accordance

with Paragraph No.8.7 of the decision in 'Magma General Insurance Company

Limited versus Nanu Ram alias Chuhru Ram and others', 2018(4) RCR (Civil)
