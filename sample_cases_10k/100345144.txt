<p id="p_3">         2.   The prosecution story as unfolded during the trial is that

         the accused No.1 Bijal Mohanbhai Parmar was married with the

         deceased Gauriben some eight years prior to the incident and

         accused No.2 Kalyanbhai Mohanbhai Parmar and accused No.3

         Champaben Mohanbhai Parmar were of the elder brother-in-

         law and mother-in-law of the deceased respectively. After her

         marriage,    the         deceased   Gauriben           started        living      at     her

         matrimonial house. That the accused No.3 used to taunt the

         deceased Gauriben by telling that she had not brought any

         dowry and her parents were miser. At the instigation of the

         mother-in-law of the deceased i.e. the accused No.3, the

         accused No.1 frequently beat the deceased. That the accused

         No.2, who lives in Rajkot, on and off used to take money by

         saying that he has a share in the farm and he used to instigate

         and misguide the accused Nos.1 and 3 used to taunt and beat

         the deceased Gauriben. During her matrimonial life, the

         deceased Gauriben used to visit her brother-the complainant

         and used to tell him about the harassment being meted out to

         her at the hands of the respondents-accused and she did not

         want to return back but due to four children, the complainant

         used to console and advise her to go back to her matrimonial

         house. Thereafter as the harassment became unbearable, on

         11.01.2004, the deceased Gauriben poured kerosene on

         herself and setting herself on fire and thereby committed

         suicide.

         and the police after completion of the investigation charge-

         sheeted the accused-respondents for the offences punishable

         under <a href="/doc/92983/" id="a_5">Sections 306</a>, <a href="/doc/538436/" id="a_6">498-A</a> and <a href="/doc/112749/" id="a_7">114</a> of the Indian Penal Code,

         wherein, at the end of the trial by judgment and order dated

         14.11.2005, the learned Judge was pleased to acquit the

         accused. This appeal against acquittal is being filed mainly on

         the ground that the learned Judge has not considered the

         complaint given by the complainant and has also not properly

         appreciated the prosecution case.

         It is his further submissions that the accused No.1 Bijal

         Mohanbhai Parmar was married with the deceased Gauriben

         and marital life was of around nine years. He also submits that

         subjected to ill-treatments owing to dowry demands.

</p><p id="p_12">         11.   It appears from the prosecution case that the marriage

         between the Gauriben and respondent No.1 was solemnised

         around nine years before the incident of Gauriben committing

         suicide happens on 11.01.2004. It emerges from the Exh.45

         complaint lodged by PW-10 Jayantilal Bhavanbhai who happens

         to be the brother of the Gauriben, deceased had come to her

         natal home around one and half months before the incident. At

         context of evidence of PW-10 Jayantibhai Bhavanbhai (Original

         complainant), PW-12 Raghubhai Bhavanbhai (Brother) and PW-

         13 Laxmiben Jayantibhai Sodha (Bhabhi) and PW-14 Babubhai

         Motibhai (Masa). It emerges that according to these witnesses

         the deceased was subjected to cruelty for not bringing dowry.

         They state in their oral evidence that the deceased was at her

         natal home about five months while PW-12 does not said as to

         when she had last come while according to PW-13 Bhabhi the

         deceased had came around 20 days before the incident. It is

         thus very clear from the evidence of these material witnesses

         that there is a very serious contradiction between the oral

         evidence of these witness about the last visit of the deceased

         of her parental home , moreover as submitted by Mr. Bharda

         general and bald allegations are made about the ill treatments

         given tot he deceased by the respondent without specifying

         the caused for the same. The aforesaid material witnesses

         have improved their version in the oral evidence before the

         Court wherein they have introduced the allegations of dowry

         demand on the part of the respondents which is not their in the

         complaint. The Supreme Court in the decision relied upon by

         Mr. Bhard as the laid down a proposition of law that there has

         to be approximate cause between the ill treatments meted out

         to the deceased and her suicidal death. In another words there

         has to be live link between the suicidal death of the deceased

         and the ill treatments meted out to her by the husband and in-

         laws. When such a link is missing or that it is to remote or stale

         the conviction cannot be recorded, in view of the contradicting

         evidence of PW-10, PW-12 and PW-13 as regards the last visit

         of the deceased to her parental home and the improvements

         in the evidence of the aforesaid material witnesses as regards

         the cause of committing suicide by the deceased, I am of the

         opinion that the view adopted by the learned Trail Judge is

         plausible which cannot be substituted by another plausible and

         reasonable view              in an acquittal appeal. For the foregoing

         reasons, I am of the opinion that impugned judgment and

         order of acquittal recorded by the learned trial Judge does not

         warrant any interference in this appeal.

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">                     "20. Generally, an appeal against
                     acquittal has always been altogether
                     on a different pedestal from that of an
                     appeal against conviction. In an
                     appeal against acquittal where the
                     presumption of innocence in favour of
                     the    accused    is    reinforced,   the
                     appellate Court would interfere with
                     the order of acquittal only when there
                     is perversity of fact and law. However,
                     we believe that the paramount
                     consideration fo the Court is to do
                     substantial     justice     and     avoid
                     miscarriage of justice which can arise
                     by acquitting the accused who is
                     guilty of an offence. A miscarriage of
                     justice that may occur by the acquittal
                     of the guilty is no less than from the
                     conviction of an innocent. This Court,
                     while enunciating the principles with
                     regard to the scope of powers of the
                     appellate Court in an appeal against
                     acquittal in <a href="/doc/1019429/" id="a_11">Sambasivan v. State of

                     Court in an appeal against acquittal,
                     are well settled. The powers of the
                     appellate Court in an appeal against
                     acquittal are no less than in an appeal
                     against conviction. But where on the
                     basis of evidence on record two views
                     are reasonably possible the appellate
                     Court cannot substitute its view in the
                     place of that of the trial Court. It is
                     only when the approach of the trial
                     Court in acquitting an accused is
                     found to be clearly erroneous in its
