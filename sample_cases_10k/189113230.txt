for termination of their services by the management and on being satisfied

with regard to existence of an Industrial Dispute between the workmen &amp;

the management the appropriate Government vide order no. F.24(1237)/95-

with the following terms of reference:

            Whether the services of S/Sh.Ravinder Sharma &amp; KK Khatri
            have been terminated illegally and/or unjustifiably by the
            management, and if so, to what relief are they entitled and
            what directions are necessary in this respect?
                                     -2-                     ID     36/2006

               Workmen Ravinder Sharma &amp; KK Khatri filed their separate

statements of claim. Workman Ravinder Sharma has stated that he was

appointed   with the management with effect from 16.9.1985 and was

designated as Supervisor. He was performing all his duties with his own

hands and for the name sake, he was a Supervisor. His last drawn salary

was Rs.5,222/- per month. The management had been changing the

designation of the workman from time to time and lastly he was designated

as Assistant Marketing Manager but during all this period, his duties were

not changed. He was neither authorized to appoint anybody or to charge

sheet anybody nor to terminate anybody. He had no financial power. The

workman could not understand the malafides of the management for

changing his designation from time to time but lastly when his services

were abruptly terminated illegally and unjustifiably without any charge

sheet, notice or enquiry and even without completing any legal formalities

by the management, then he was told by the management that his

designations have been changed by the management intentionally so that he

may not be covered within the definition of workman under the <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_1">ID Act</a>. The

management sent one cheque amounting to Rs.25,297.75 which the

workman received under protest without prejudice to his claim and

contentions including his claim for reinstatement in service with continuity

of service and full back wages. The workman filed complaint before the
                                     -3-                     ID 36/2006

Assistant Labour Commissioner. The management did not turn up before

the Assistant Labour Commissioner. The workman filed claim before the

Conciliation officer. The management did not co-operate in the conciliation

proceedings and the conciliation proceedings failed and the matter was

referred to the Court for adjudication. Accordingly it has been prayed that

the management may be directed to reinstate the workman with continuity

of service and full back wages along with consequential benefits.

               Workman KK Khatri in his statement of claim has stated

that he was appointed with the management with effect from 1.10.1985

and his services were terminated with effect from 6.1.1995 without any

charge sheet, notice or enquiry and his last drawn salary was Rs.3,040/- per

month. Initially he was kept as a Salesman cum driver, but he had to

perform miscellaneous other duties and had to work for more than 12 hours

a day without any overtime. The management decided to terminate him

and he was designated as Depot Incharge but his duties remained the same.

He was neither authorized to appoint anybody or to charge sheet anybody

nor to disburse any payment. He was Depot Incharge for name sake only.

His services were terminated illegally, wrongfully and unjustifiably with

effect from 6.1.1995 and he was paid Rs.19,210.02 through two cheques

which the workman accepted under protest without prejudice to his claim.

The workman through his Union filed a complaint before the Assistant
                                     -4-                     ID 36/2006

Labour Commissioner but the management did not turn up before the

Assistant Labour Commissioner. The workman filed his claim before the

Conciliation officer but the management did not co-operate in the

conciliation proceedings and the conciliation proceedings failed and the

matter was referred to the Court for adjudication. Accordingly it has been

prayed that the management may be directed to reinstate the workman with

continuity of service and full back wages along with consequential benefits.

submitted that the services of the applicant were discharged strictly in

accordance with his contract of employment and subsequently the applicant

settled his dues in full &amp; final and received an amount of Rs.25,297.75. The
