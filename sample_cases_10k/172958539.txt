       (<a href="/doc/137043943/" id="a_1">Sushil Kumar Singh Kasliwal v. State of M.P</a>. through Registrar, Public Trust Indore )



Indore dated 02.04.2018
     Shri R.S. Chhabra, learned counsel for the petitioner.
     Shri A.S. Garg, learned Senior Counsel with Shri
Swapnesh Jain, learned counsel for the respondent Nos.2 and</pre>
<p id="p_1">3.
     Heard.
</p><p id="p_2">     This review petition has been filed                                      by the review
petitioner for review of order dated 2/02/2018, passed in W.A.
No.1273/2017.
</p><p id="p_3">     Learned counsel for the review petitioner has drawn our
attention to page - 3 of order dated 19/11/2015 and submitted
that application dated 22/02/2015 filed by the review petitioner
under Section 9(1) of M.P. Public Trusts Act, 1951 (in short ...
"The Act") was rejected on the ground that names do no appear
in the Registry whereas it is the duty of the Registrar to
maintain record properly. He has also drawn our attention to
Section 9 of the Act and Para - 5.1 of the reply filed by the
respondent No.2 and submitted that the review petitioner was
removed from the trust for not attending                                 three consecutive
meetings of the trust without giving intimation to the President
as per the Trusty Deed (Condition No.14), but this was not
there in the Register maintained in the office of Registrar nor
any change was intimated                          or recorded in the Panjiyam
Register and submitted that the writ petition was very much
maintainable. The learned writ Court as well as the Division
Bench of this Court without appreciating the provisions of M.P.
Public Trusts Act, 1951 gave a finding that the review petitioner
           has not been found to be a working Trustee of the Trust and he
          has no locus-standi to file an application. With the aforesaid,
          he submitted that there is error apparent on the fate of record
          and prayed that this review petition be allowed.
</p><p id="p_4">                On due consideration of the aforesaid        so also the
          reasoning assigned by us on 2/02/2018 in W.A. No.1273/2017,
          we are of the view that there is no error apparent on the face of
          record. No case is made out to review the impugned order
          dated 2/02/2018, passed in WA. No.1273/2017, as prayed is
          made out.
</p><p id="p_5">                The review petition filed by the review petitioner has no
          merit and is accordingly dismissed.
