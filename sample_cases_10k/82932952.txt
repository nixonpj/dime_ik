ORAL JUDGMENT
Date: 17-07-2018

                   Heard learned counsel for the petitioners and learned

   counsel for the State.
</p>
<p id="p_9">   2.              This application under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_1">Section 482</a> of the Code of

   Criminal Procedure (for short '<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_2">Cr.P.C</a>.') has been filed by the

   petitioners for quashing the order dated 24.04.2018 passed by the

   learned Additional Sessions Judge 6th, Madhubani in Cr.Misc. No. 13

   of 2018whereby he has dismissed the application filed by the

   petitioner for recalling the judgment dated 16.05.2017 passed in

   Cr.Appeal No. 47 of 1998.
</p>
<p id="p_10">   3.              The petitioners were convicted inter alia under <a href="/doc/538436/" id="a_3">Section

   498-A</a> of the Indian Penal Code and sentenced to undergo R.I. for one

   year and a fine of Rs.1,000/- each by the judgment delivered by the

   learned Judicial Magistrate 1st Class, Madhubani in C.R.Case No. 724
 Patna High Court Cr.M isc. No.36403 of 2018 dt.17-07-2018

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                            2/4</span>




         of 1992 corresponding to T.R. No. 723 of 1998.

</p><p id="p_11">         4.              Being aggrieved by the judgment of conviction and the

         order of sentence passed by the learned Magistrate, the petitioners

         filed an appeal before the learned Sessions Judge vide Cr.Appeal No.

         47 of 1998. The said appeal was admitted for hearing and the

         petitioners were allowed to continue on bail. Subsequently, when the

         appeal was taken up for hearing, neither the appellants nor their

         counsel appeared before the appellate court. From perusal of the

         impugned order 24.04.2018, it would be manifest that several notices

         were issued to the petitioners but they did not respond to the notice

         issued by the court. Seeing no way out, the appellate court appointed

         one Shambhu Sharan Mishra, an advocate, to assist the court as

         amicus curiae. After hearing the amicus curiae, the appellate court

         dismissed the appeal finding no error in the judgment and order

         passed by the court of Magistrate.
</p>
<p id="p_12">         5.              Subsequently, the petitioners preferred Cr. Misc. No. 13

         of 2018 before the appellate court for recall of the judgment passed in

         Cr.Appeal No. 47 of 1998 on the ground that they had not been given

         an opportunity of being heard. The appellate court vide impugned

         order dated 24.04.2018 dismissed the application filed by the

         petitioners.
</p>
<p id="p_13">         6.              Being aggrieved by the order dated 24.04.2018, the

         petitioners have approached this Court by way of filing the instant
 Patna High Court Cr.M isc. No.36403 of 2018 dt.17-07-2018

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                            3/4</span>




         application under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_4">Section 482</a> of the Cr.P.C.

</p><p id="p_14">         7.              On query, learned counsel for the petitioners submitted

         that the application was filed before the court below under <a href="/doc/321111/" id="a_5">Section

         385</a> of the Cr.P.C. He submitted that since the petitioners were never

         given opportunity of being heard, it was incumbent upon the appellate

         court to have recalled its judgment and it ought to have given an

         opportunity to the petitioners to place their case and only thereafter

         the appellate court could have delivered its judgment.

</p><p id="p_15">         8.              In my considered opinion, the application filed by the

         petitioners before the appellate court was thoroughly misconceived.

         On merits, the appellate court had no jurisdiction to recall or review

         its own order in view of the express bar under <a href="/doc/789330/" id="a_6">Section 362</a> of the

         Cr.P.C, which reads as under :-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">                         "362. Court not to alter judgment.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">                         Save as otherwise provided by this Code or by any
                         other law for the time being in force, no Court when
                         it has signed its judgment or final order disposing of
                         a case, shall alter or review the same except to
                         correct a clerical or arithmetical error."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_16">         9.              The provisions prescribed under <a href="/doc/789330/" id="a_7">Section 362</a> of the

         Cr.P.C. applies to judgments as well as final orders. It prohibits the

         court from altering or reviewing any judgment or final order

         disposing of the case after it has been signed except for the purpose of

         correction of clerical or arithmetical error. As soon as the judgment or

         final order disposing of a case is signed, it becomes final and the
             Patna High Court Cr.M isc. No.36403 of 2018 dt.17-07-2018

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                                        4/4</span>




                     court becomes functus officio.
</p>
<p id="p_17">                     10.             So far as <a href="/doc/321111/" id="a_8">Section 385</a> of the Cr.P.C. is concerned, it

                     simply provides that once the appeal is admitted and notice is issued,

                     the appellate court should dispose of the appeal on merits and there is

                     no provision for dismissing the appeal in default on non-appearance

                     of the appellant. It also provides that the appeal cannot be restricted to

                     any selected ground which is specified in the petition and it should be

                     decided on merits.
</p>
<p id="p_18">                     11.             In the instant case, the appellate court had dismissed the

                     appeal on merits. There was no clerical or arithmetical error. Hence,

                     the court below could not have recalled or reviewed its final judgment

                     in view of <a href="/doc/789330/" id="a_9">Section 362</a> of the Cr.P.C. Since the appeal has not been

                     disposed of in default, there is no application to <a href="/doc/321111/" id="a_10">Section 385</a> of the

                     Cr.P.C. The application filed before the court below was meritless.

                     Hence, the same was rightly dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_19">                     12.             In that view of the matter, the application, being devoid

                     of any merit, is dismissed.
