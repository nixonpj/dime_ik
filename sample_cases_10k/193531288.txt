                      of partition.     Pending suit, the petitioner / plaintiff filed an

                      amendment petition and the same was allowed.                    Since the

                      petitioner / plaintiff has not taken steps to amend the plaint, the

                      representation on behalf of the petitioner / plaintiff, the suit was

                      dismissed for default on 12.11.2003.        Since there was 366 days

                      petitioner / plaintiff filed I.A.No.67 of 2005.      The Court below

                      dismissed the same, against which, the present Civil Revision

                      Petition has been filed.

                      would submit that the petitioner / plaintiff was not in station at the

                      time of dismissal of the suit. The counsel of the petitioner / plaintiff

                      appeared before the Court below, was died and the same has not

                      been informed to her till April, 2004.     She has also suffered from

                      Hepatitis â€“ B. The case bundle also found out in the office of the

                      counsel only during the month of November, 2004 and the present

                      petition has been filed in the month of December, 2004. Hence, the

                      delay has occurred. In a petition to condone the delay, the Court

                      below ought to have taken a more sympathetic view, but has

                      erroneously dismissed the same. Thus, he prayed to set aside the

                      same.

                      given proper explanation for the inordinate delay of 366 days and he

                      has no interest in prosecuting the matter. The reasons assigned on

                      the side of the petitioner / plaintiff are also not acceptable. Thus, he

                      prayed to dismiss the revision petition.

                      in respect of the respondents 12 to 15; and their names were also

                      filed the suit for partition. The petitioner and the respondents 3 to 5

                      are sisters. When the suit was posted for effecting amendment in

                      the plaint on 12.11.2003, there was no representation on the side of

                      the petitioner / plaintiff and therefore, the suit was dismissed for

                      default.

                      discretion of the Court. There should be a liberal, pragmatic, justice

                      oriented, non-pedantic approach while dealing with an application

                      for condonation of delay. The length of delay is not material and

                      acceptability of explanation is important.       Even the delay of long

                      range can be condoned if the explanation is satisfactory.              The

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                                          5</span>

                      reasons assigned on the side of the petitioner / plaintiff are that her

                      counsel was died and she got the case bundle only in the month of

                      November, 2004 from the office of the previous counsel and

                      therefore, the delay was occurred. This Court is of the view that the

                      reasons stated by the petitioner are somewhat acceptable. Refusing

                      to condone a delay will result in meritorious matter being thrown out

                      at the nascent stage and thereby the cause of justice being

                      defeated. On the other hand, if a party is allowed to enter into the

                      scene of main proceedings, then the matter can be decided on

                      merits. Considering the facts and circumstances of the case and

                      length of delay and also considering the fact that it is a suit for

                      partition, the Court below could have liberally considered the

                      petition and granted an opportunity to the petitioner / plaintiff to

                      putforth her case by imposing cost.        But, it has failed to do so.

                      Hence, this Court is inclined to allow this petition on terms to meet

                      the ends of justice.
