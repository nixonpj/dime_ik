IN THE HIGH COURT OF JUDICATURE FOR RAJASTHAN
         AT PRINCIPAL SEAT, JODHPUR

                       ORDER
                         In
        S.B. Cr. Misc. Petition No.641/2009

             {Amar Singh      Vs.       The    State    of
             Rajasthan}

           Date of Order :: 8th July, 2009

                       PRESENT
      HON'BLE SHRI JUSTICE NARENDRA KUMAR JAIN

Shri Gopi Kishan Sharma, Counsel for petitioner
Shri Mahipal Vishnoi and
Smt. Raj Laxmi Singh, PP for the State
                      ####


By the Court:</pre>


<p id="p_1">       Heard learned counsel for the parties.

       The     petitioner          has         preferred       this

petition against the            order dated 21st             April,

2003    passed   by     the    Judicial         Magistrate,     1st

Class, Nokha (Bikaner), whereby the accused-

petitioner      was   summoned          through    non-bailable

warrant.
</p>
<p id="p_2">       The    learned    counsel         for    the    petitioner

contended that although the bailable warrant

was served upon the petitioner but the order

taking cognizance was challenged and the file

was     summoned        by    the        revisional          court,

therefore, he could not appear before the trial

court on that date. Now, the revision petition

has been dismissed and, after receipt of the
                                  // 2 //

file from the revisional court, the accused-

petitioner has again been summoned through non-

bailable warrant. He submits that the next date

in the trial court is 20th July, 2009 and the

petitioner       undertakes          to     appear    before     the

trial court, but his warrant of arrest may be

converted into bailable warrant.

</p><p id="p_3">        The    learned      Public         Prosecutor      has   not

opposed the prayer seriously.
</p>
<p id="p_4">        I have considered the submissions of the

learned       counsel      for   the       parties.   It    appears

that    on     2nd   December,         2002,    cognizance       was

taken against the accused-petitioner Amar Singh

and co-accused Magga Ram and Bagtudevi for the

offence under Sections 420, 467, 468 and 471,

<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_1">IPC</a>, and they were summoned through bailable

warrant; the accused-petitioner did not appear

despite service of bailable warrant, therefore,

he was summoned through non-bailable warrant

vide order dated 21st April, 2003. It appears

from the order-sheet dated 17th April, 2008 of

the trial court that file of the revisional

court     i.e.       the    Additional         Sessions      Judge

reached to the trial court on that date and as

per the earlier orders the accused has been

summoned         through           non-bailable            warrant.

Although, I do not find any illegality in the
                                // 3 //

impugned order passed by the trial court in

summoning the accused-petitioner through non-

bailable warrant in the facts and circumstances

of the present case, but, in the interest of

justice, I think it fit and proper that ends of

justice       will     meet     in       case   the        accused-

petitioner is directed to make himself present

before the trial court and to direct the trial

court to release him on bail.
</p>
<p id="p_5">        Consequently,         this       petition     is    partly

allowed and it is directed that in case the

petitioner appears before the trial court on or

before       20th    July,    2009       then   he    shall     be

released on bail on such terms and conditions

regarding bail bonds, as imposed by the trial

court.
