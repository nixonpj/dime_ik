         CORAM:
        HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE S.P.GARG

S.P.GARG, J.
</pre>
<p id="p_1">1.              Cri.Rev.P.160/2016     and   Crl.Rev.P.162/2016     have      been
preferred by the petitioner(s) to challenge the legality and correctness of
judgments dated 22.08.2015 of learned District and Sessions Judge in
Crl.A.No.58/2015 and Crl.A.No.57/2015 by which the conviction and
sentence recorded by the learned Metropolitan Magistrate in the judgments
dated 07.07.2015 and the order on sentence dated 13.07.2015 were
endorsed.
</p><p id="p_2">2.              The petitions are contested by the complainant. It is relevant to
note that in Crl.Rev.P.No.160/2016, the petitioner was sentenced to undergo
Rigorous Imprisonment for eighteen months with compensation of
`2,40,000/-; the default sentence for non-payment of compensation being
simple imprisonment for six months. Similar sentence was awarded to the
appellant in Crl.Rev.P.No.162/2016 with compensation of `4,00,000/-.
</p><p id="p_3">3.              I have heard the learned counsel for the parties and have
examined the file. In Crl.Rev.P.No.160/2016, in the complaint case under
<a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_1">Section 138</a> Negotiable Instruments Act it was averred by the complainant
that in the second week of May, 2007, he had advanced                  a loan of
`1,20,000/- to the petitioner on his assurance to discharge it within a year.
In discharge of liability, the petitioner issued three cheques (Ex.CW-1/1 to
CW-1/3) detailed therein for a total sum of `1,20,000/-. On presentation,
these cheques were dishonored with the remarks "insufficient funds" vide
returns memo (Ex.CW1/7 to Ex.CW1/9). Legal notice (Ex.CW-1/13) was




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">Crl.Rev.P.Nos.160/16 &amp; 162/16                                       Page 2 of 6</span>
 served upon the petitioner which remained uncomplied. Affidavit (Ex.CW-
1/A) in post- notice evidence was filed and proved. In the statement under
<a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_2">Section 281</a> read with <a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_3">Section 313</a> Cr.P.C. recorded on 7.12.2012, the
petitioner claimed that the cheques in question were issued in blank towards
security of loan of `40,000/- taken by Ms.Ravinder Kaur Sodhi from the
complainant. The petitioner examined himself in defence. Upon hearing the
arguments, the Trial Court came to the conclusion that the petitioner was
guilty of the offence under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_4">Section 138</a> Negotiable Instruments Act. The
findings were endorsed by the appellate court.
</p><p id="p_4">4.              Similarly, in Crl.Rev.P.No.162/2016, the complainant Chander
Prakash in complaint case No.130/01/08 averred that he had advanced
funding of `2,00,000/- to the petitioner in the third week of June, 2007 with
the assurance to return it by 30.06.2008. The petitioner had issued three
cheques for the total sum of `2,00,000/- as detailed in the complaint. These
cheques were dishonored on presentation. Legal demand notice was served
on 26.07.2008 but it had no impact. The petitioner did not lead any evidence
in defence and it was closed on 16.02.2015. After appreciating the evidence
on record, the Trial Court found the petitioner guilty of the offence under
<a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_5">Section 138</a> Negotiable Instruments Act. The appeal against the findings
resulted in its dismissal.
</p><p id="p_5">5.              Issuance of cheques in both the petitions is not in controversy.
The Trial Court and the Appellate Court have clearly noted that defence
taken by the petitioner for issuance of cheques in question was conflicting.
At one stage, he had claimed that these cheques were issued as a security
for different loans taken by Ravinder Kaur Sodhi from the complainant.
However, in applications under Section 145(2) Negotiable Instruments Act



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">Crl.Rev.P.Nos.160/16 &amp; 162/16                                      Page 3 of 6</span>
 filed by him in both the petitions, he took an inconsistent defence stating that
he had lost these cheques and had lodged a complaint in that regard. It was
noted by the Trial Court that the petitioner was unable to substantiate the
defence in either way. He was unable to prove if any loan was ever taken by
Ms.Ravinder Kaur Sodhi from the complainant or he had stood surety and
had issued the cheques in question as a 'security'. Ms.Ravinder Kaur Sodhi
was not even examined by the petitioner. No documents, whatsoever, have
been placed on record to show if any loan was taken from the complainant
or any proceedings were initiated by him against her. It was also not proved
beyond doubt that the petitioner had lost the cheque book and these cheques
were issued in blank by him.
</p><p id="p_6">6.              The Trial Court further observed that the petitioner was unable
to rebut the presumption in favour of the complainant either on the basis of
material available on record or by adducing any defence evidence.
</p><p id="p_7">7.              The findings of the courts below are based on fair appreciation
of the evidence and deserve no intervention. I find no substance in the
petitioner's contention that the cheques issued by him were 'blank' and its
other particulars were filled up subsequently. The position has been
explained in the judgment of the Division Bench of Kerala High Court in
lillykutty vs.Lawrance 2003 (2) DCR 610 in the following words:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">            "In the instant case, signature is admitted. According to the
            drawer of the cheque, amount and the name has been written
            not by the drawer but by somebody else or by the payee and
            tried to get it encashed. We are of the view, by putting the
            amount and the name there is no material alteration on the
            cheque under <a href="/doc/692532/" id="a_6">Section 87</a> of the Negotiable Instruments Act.
            In fact there is no alteration but only adding the amount and
            the date. There is no rule in banking business that payee's



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">Crl.Rev.P.Nos.160/16 &amp; 162/16                                     Page 4 of 6</span>
             name as well as the amount should be written by drawer
            himself.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">            The above judgment was quoted with agreement by the
            Hon'ble Delhi High Court in <a href="/doc/692276/" id="a_7">Ravi Chopra vs.State &amp;
            Anr</a>.2008 (2) JCC (NI) 169 and it was held that if the
            signatures on the cheque are admitted by the accused, it
            matters little if the name of the payee, date and amount are
            filled up at a subsequent point in time.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">            In view of the above judgments, the contention raised by the
            petitioner that the amount and name of the drawee were not
            filled in by the petitioner, does not have any force in the
            eyes of law."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_8">8.              The findings of the court below can't be faulted and are
affirmed.
</p><p id="p_9">9.               Regarding sentence, it has come on record that the petitioner
has been sentenced to undergo simple imprisonment for eighteen months
each with total compensation amount of `6,40,000/- and the default sentence
for non-payment is one year in all. The sentence awarded appears to be
excessive. Nominal roll dated 18.07.2016 reflects that the petitioner has
undergone ten months and twenty six days incarceration besides remission
for one month and twenty days in complaint case No.130/01/08
(Crl.Rev.P.No.160/2016) as on 18.07.2016. The sentence in other complaint
case No. 237/1/08 (in Crl.Rev.P.162/2016) is yet to start. Nominal roll
further reflects that the petitioner is not a previous convict and is not
involved in any other criminal case.          His overall conduct in jail is
satisfactory.     Considering the facts and circumstances of the case, the
sentence order requires modification.
