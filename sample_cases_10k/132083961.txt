<p id="p_1">1.      The allegations are that on 25.10.05 at 7 AM at Petrol Pump, in front

   of Metro Station Welcome, Delhi accused was driving one bus bearing

   registration No. DL 1PA 3851 in a high speed and in a rash and negligent

   manner and struck against TSR No. DL 1RF 5015 as a result Prem Singh

   fell down and sustained injuries.  After usual investigation, charge sheet

   was submitted U/s 279/337/338 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_3">IPC</a> in the court for trial.

</p><p id="p_2">2.      Accused put his appearance.  Copies of challan were supplied to him.

   NOA U/s 251  <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_4">Cr.P.C</a>. was put  on 02.02.07 by my Ld. Predecessor to

   which he pleaded not guilty and claimed trial.   Prosecution examined 2

   witnesses.
</p>
<p id="p_3">3.      The   complainant   /   injured   Prem   Singh   has   compromised   with   the

   accused.  Her statement on oath was recorded separately and as a result of

   compromise accused stands acquitted of the offence charged U/s 338 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_5">IPC</a>

   vide my separate order in the order sheet of even date.

</p><p id="p_4">4.      Accused submitted that he admitted his guilt as main offence stands

   compounded.  In view of this, PE was closed.  Statement of accused U/s
                                                                           FIR No.562/2005

   281 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_6">Cr.P.C</a>. is recorded wherein he has admitted the prosecution case.

</p><p id="p_5">5.     Prosecution   examined   2   witnesses.     PW1   Taslimuddin   has

   mechanically   inspected   bus   No.   DL   1P   3851   and   issued   his   report

   Ex.PW1/A.
</p>
<p id="p_6">6.     PW2 Kuldeep Singh stated that he is owner of Kuldeep Travels.  He

   is owner of bus No. DL­1PA­3851.  The accused was driver of the bus on

   the   day   of   accident.     On   25.10.05,   on   the   receipt   of   information   of

   accident, he reached at the spot i.e. in front of Metro Station Welcome. A

   notice U/s 133 M V Act was given to him.   He produced the driver /

   accused before the police as accused was driving the bus at the time of

   accident  on the day of incident.   He filed the reply Ex.PW­2/A to the

   notice U/s 133 M V Act.  The accused was arrested.  Personal search and

   arrest   memos   Ex.PW­2/B&amp;C   were   prepared.     He   took   the   bus   on

   superdari by executing superdarinama Ex.PW­2/D.

</p><p id="p_7">7.     The testimony of PW2 clearly shows that accused was driving bus in

   question.  The accused has admitted the prosecution case in his statement

   U/s 281 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_7">Cr.P.C</a>.
</p><p id="p_8">                                                                   FIR No.562/2005

</p><p id="p_9">8.      Keeping in view the admission on the part of accused in his statement

   U/s 281 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_8">Cr.P.C</a>, it is clear that accused was driving bus No. DL 1PA 3851

   in a high speed and in a rash and negligent manner and struck against

   Prem Singh who fell down.
</p>
<p id="p_10">9.      Hence,  I have no hesitation to hold that prosecution has proved its

   case   against   the   accused   beyond   shadow   of   reasonable   doubt   and

   accordingly accused is held guilty U/s 279 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_9">IPC</a> and convicted.

</p><p id="p_11">10.     Heard and perused the record.  The accused is a first offender as there

   is nothing on the record to suggest his previous conviction.   The   main

   offence stands compounded.  I am of the view that interest of justice shall

   be met if sentence of fine is imposed.  Hence, accused is sentenced to pay

   fine of Rs.1000/­ for offence U/s 279 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_10">IPC</a> and in default of payment of

   fine to undergo SI for a period of 10 days.  Fine paid in the court.  File be

   consigned to record room.
