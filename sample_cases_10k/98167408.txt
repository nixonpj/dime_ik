Maharashtra Sales Tax Tribunal passed under Section 26(b) of the

</pre><p id="p_2">2.           The impugned order of the Tribunal records the fact that for

the   period   from   2008-2009   assessment   was   completed   on   30 th

March, 2013 denying the appellant's claim of input tax credit. This

resulted in an aggregate demand of Rs.1.90 Crores (inclusive of

interest).

<p id="p_3">
</p><p id="p_4">3.           Being aggrieved with the assessment order dated 30th March,

2013   the   petitioner   had   filed   a   First   Appeal   to   the   Deputy

Commissioner of Sales Tax (Appeals). In the first Appeal a part

payment   was   ordered   by   the   First   Appellate   Authority   on   11 th

the Appeal.

the First Appeal was decided by the Deputy Commissioner of Sales

Tax   (Appeal)   by   order   dated   15th  March,   2017   confirming   the

assessment order dated 30th March, 2013.

First   Appellate   Authority   the   petitioner   challenged   the   same

before   the   Tribunal.   In   that   Appeal   the   petitioner   took   out   an

application to stay the order dated 15th  March, 2017 of the First

Appellate   Authority,   leading   to   the   impugned   order   of   the

Tribunal. 
</p>
<p id="p_11">
</p><p id="p_12">7.           The impugned order dated 5th March, 2018 of the Tribunal

records the fact that its earlier order directing the petitioner to

deposit Rs. 33.64 Lakh for stay of the assessment order was not

complied with by the petitioner till the passing of the impugned

order. In these circumstances it was of the view that there is no

occasion   to   vary   the   earlier   order   directing   the   petitioner   to

deposit Rs.33.64 Lakh out of aggregate demand of Rs. 1.90 Crores

passed by it earlier. This earlier order was neither complied with

by the petitioner nor was it challenged before any higher forum.</p><pre id="pre_4">




                                                                           3 of 6

</pre><p id="p_13">8.           Mr.   Thakar,   learned   Counsel   appearing   in   support   of   the

petition submits that the impugned order of the Tribunal would

require   interference.   This   as   it   is   not   taken   into   account   the

decision of the Tribunal in the case of  M/s. Mahalaxmi Cotton

Ginning Pressing and Oil Industries VAT Second Appeal No.195

of 2015 decided on 20/10/2017. Besides, it is submitted that the

cause   of   action   in   this   appeal   is   different   from   that   when   the

earlier order was passed by the Tribunal. Therefore, it should have

considered the submission on merits and not dismissed it as on

account   of   not   complying   with   its   earlier   order.   Besides,   Mr.

Thakar   submits   that   the   petitioner   is   in   financial   difficulty.

However nothing is on record to support the same nor was any

submission with regard to find hardship made before the Tribunal.


</p><p id="p_14">9.           It   is   a   settled   position   that   while   exercising   our

extraordinary writ jurisdiction, the conduct of the petitioner is an

important factor to decide whether the Court should exercise it in

favour   of   the   petitioner.   We   find   that   the   petitioner   had

approached the Tribunal in earlier round of proceedings and he

was directed to deposit an amount of Rs. 33.64 Lakh on or before

31st  July, 2017 for stay of the assessment order.   The petitioner

                                                                              4 of 6
 Shridhar Sutar                          5                20-wp-1951-18.doc


did  not   comply   with the  directions of  the  Tribunal  nor did the

petitioner challenge it. Thereafter on 15th  March, 2017 an order

was   passed   by   the   First   Appellate   Authority   confirming   the

assessment order dated 30th March, 2013. The same has now been

challenged before the Tribunal and the stay of the First Appellate

order   (which   upheld   the   order   in   original)   is   sought   by   the

petitioner. This without any explanation, as to why the petitioner

did not comply with the earlier orders of the Tribunal in respect of

stay of the assessment order passed by the Tribunal. It must be

appreciated that the order of the Tribunal passed under the Act,

has sanctity attached to it. It must be followed unless stayed by a

higher forum. The proceedings before the Tribunal are not to be

initiated   for   time  pass   and  with  no  intent    to  comply  with  the

same, if not convenient.  In these circumstances the view taken by

the Tribunal does not warrant any interference in exercise of our

jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_2">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India.


</p><p id="p_15">10.          In these facts, the conduct of the petitioner dis-entitles it to

any relief under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_3">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India.


</p><p id="p_16">11.          At this stage, Mr. Thakar sought extension of time to deposit


                                                                         5 of 6
                                Shridhar Sutar                          6                20-wp-1951-18.doc


                               the amount directed by the impugned order of the Tribunal. In

                               view of not having entertained the petition, we see no reason to

                               grant any extension. However, we make it clear that in case the

                               petitioner does deposit the amount as directed by the impugned

                               order of the Tribunal, it would be open to him to approach the

                               Tribunal  to  extend  the   time  to  make  the  deposit.  The   Tribunal

                               would consider such an application on its own merits and pass

                               appropriate orders thereon.
