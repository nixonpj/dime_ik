                 being aggrieved by the judgment and order dated 17th June 2009
                 passed in Cr. Appeal No. 120 of 2008 by the learned Sessions
                 Judge, Saran at Chapra allowing the aforesaid appeal, preferred by

                 Code, has preferred the present revision application under <a href="/doc/1457888/" id="a_5">Sections
                 397</a> and <a href="/doc/1571667/" id="a_6">401</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, questioning
                 the validity and correctness of the impugned judgment of acquittal
                 recorded by the learned lower appellate court.
</p><p id="p_3">                                 The petitioner lodged a criminal case with respect to
                 an occurrence alleged to have taken place on 17.08.2005 at about
                 5.30 A.M. in the morning. The opposite party no. 2 to 4 were put
                 on trial with respect to the accusation made by the petitioner in the
                 aforesaid criminal case. Charges under <a href="/doc/162506/" id="a_7">Sections 447</a>, <a href="/doc/1599401/" id="a_8">341</a>, <a href="/doc/1011035/" id="a_9">323</a>,<a href="/doc/1402213/" id="a_10">337</a>

             accused opposite party no. 2 to 4. In support of the prosecution
             case altogether six witnesses were examined, out of them P.W. 1
             is the informant himself. P.Ws. 2, 3 and 4 are his wife, son and
             mother respectively and P.W. 6 is the doctor. P.W. 5 is the I.O. of
             the case. On conclusion of trial by judgment and order dated
             21.08.2008 passed in G.R. Case No. 2421 of 2005/ Trial No. 2548
             of 2008 by the learned Judicial Magistrate, 1 st Class, Chapra,
             Saran, accused opposite parties were acquitted of the charge under
             <a href="/doc/555306/" id="a_13">Section 504</a>/<a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_14">34</a> of the Indian Penal Code. However, they were
             convicted for charges under <a href="/doc/162506/" id="a_15">Sections 447</a>, <a href="/doc/1011035/" id="a_16">323</a>, <a href="/doc/1599401/" id="a_17">341</a> and <a href="/doc/1402213/" id="a_18">337</a> of the
             Indian Penal Code and, accordingly, they were sentenced to
             undergo simple imprisonment for one month under <a href="/doc/162506/" id="a_19">Section 447</a>
             I.P.C, simple imprisonment for one month under <a href="/doc/1599401/" id="a_20">Section 341</a> of
             the Indian Penal Code, rigorous imprisonment for one year under

             under <a href="/doc/1402213/" id="a_22">Section 337</a> of the Indian Penal Code. However, all the
             sentence were directed to run concurrently. The opposite party no.
             2 to 4 being aggrieved by the aforesaid judgment, preferred Cr.
             Appeal No. 120 of 2008, which has been allowed by the impugned
             judgment of acquittal dated 17th June 2009 passed by the learned
             Sessions Judge, Saran at Chapra. Hence, the present revision
             application at the behest of the informant.
</p><p id="p_4">                              Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the
             learned lower appellate court has not appreciated the evidence of
             the witnesses correctly. According to him, if the evidence of
             prosecution witnesses would have been properly appreciated by
             the learned lower appellate court, then there was no occasion for
             interference in the judgment of conviction recorded by the learned
             trial court. It is contended that though all the four material
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3"> Patna High Court CR. REV. No.1373 of 2009 (4) dt.07-12-201</span>

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                          3/4</span>




             witnesses were the family members of the informant, but they all
             have supported the prosecution case and the P.W. 6, the doctor has
             also found injury on the person of the victim. Therefore, according
             to him, the impugned judgment passed by the learned lower
             appellate court is not sustainable in the eye of law and the matter
             is required to be remitted back for fresh decision.
</p><p id="p_5">                              Learned Additional Public Prosecutor appearing on
             behalf of the State has opposed the prayer and supported the
             impugned judgment of acquittal recorded by the learned lower
             appellate court.
</p><p id="p_6">                              After having heard the parties and on examination of
             the materials available on record, this Court finds that the learned
             lower appellate court has meticulously scrutinized the evidence
             available on record and thereafter it has come to a finding that the
             evidence of P.Ws. 1 and 2 are contradictory to the evidence of
             P.Ws. 3 and 4. According to the findings of the learned lower
             appellate court, manner of occurrence as also the place of
             occurrence have not been conclusively proved by the prosecution
             party, and, therefore, accused persons are entitled to have the
             benefits of doubts. The learned lower appellate court has also
             come to a finding that the injury report prepared by P.W. 6 did not
             support the time of occurrence as disclosed by the prosecution. By
             taking into consideration the aforesaid circumstances, and by
             extending the benefits of doubts to the accused persons, the
             learned lower appellate court has reversed the judgment of
             conviction and order of sentence passed by the learned trial court
             and has allowed the appeal filed on behalf of the accused opposite
             party no. 2 to 4 and, thereafter, has recorded the impugned
             judgment of acquittal.

<p id="p_7">                                      It is well established principles of law that the appeal
                     is a continuation of trial. The learned lower appellate court was
                     fully justified and well within its jurisdiction to reappraise the
                     evidence of the prosecution witnesses for coming to a different
                     conclusion than that of the learned trial court. This Court does not
                     find any legal infirmity or procedural irregularity or jurisdictional
                     error committed by the learned lower appellate court in passing
                     the impugned judgment of acquittal.
</p><p id="p_8">                                      In the result, the application has to fail and is,
                     accordingly, dismissed.
