                      decree passed in R.C.O.P.No.168 of 2004. The said R.C.O.P was

                      filed by the first respondent herein, who is a landlady for

                      evicting the respondents/tenants to vacate and deliver the

                      possession of the schedule mentioned property for the

                      purpose of demolition and reconstruction.



</p><p id="p_3">                           3.The R.C.O.P was filed by the landlady against the

                      respondents 1 and 2, who are the running Candy and Essence

                      Agency Business and they are the tenants in the said property

                      for more than 30 years at the monthly rent of Rs.1,000/-. The

                      averments made by the landlady in the said R.C.O.P., is that

                      the said petition mentioned property was constructed even

                      before 1897 and the age of the building is more than 106

                      years and the entire building is in a dilapidated condition and

                      it may collapse at any time. Hence, the petitioner/landlady

                      sought the relief of evicting the tenants from the said property

                      for the purpose of demolition and reconstruction in the suit

                      the landlady made an attempt with the assistance of the rowdy

                      elements and attempted to demolish a portion of the building

                      with a malafide intention to cause serious damages to the

                      portions under the occupation of the petitioner. Hence, the

                      respondents/tenants contended that there is no real cause of

                      action for filing the petition on the ground of demolition and

                      reconstruction.

                      analyzing the contentions raised by the petitioner and the

                      respondents,        has    observed         that    when     the     first

                      respondent/tenant has filed several documents with regard to

                      the payment of rent, in respect of the petition mentioned

                      property, the application filed by the landlady is only for the

                      relief     of   eviction   on   the       ground   of   demolition   and

                      reconstruction. The Principal Rent Control Authority, Madurai,

                      has also observed that the first respondent/tenant has filed a

                      suit for specific performance against the petitioner. Whereas,

                      the other family members have filed a suit in O.S.No.207/2004

                      before the I Additional District Court, Madurai, in respect of

                      the petition mentioned property. The said suit filed by the

                      respondents/tenants was also dismissed. Against which, the

                      first respondent has preferred a Fist Appeal in A.S.No.94 of

                      2012 before this Court and the same is pending. Hence, the

                      Principal Rent Control Authority, Madurai, has considered the

                      request of the petitioner/landlady as a bonafide one and also

                      the financial capacity of the petitioner, has allowed the

                      petition and ordered eviction on the ground of demolition and

                      reconstruction.   Aggrieved   against   the   said   order,   the

                      petitioners herein, who are the tenants have preferred

                      R.C.A.No.30 of 2016 before the Principal Subordinate Judge

                      (Learned Rent Control Appellate Authority), Madurai.



</p><p id="p_8">                           6.In the R.C.A., the Rent Control Appellate Authority,

                      Madurai, has observed the facts stated by both the tenants as

                      well as the landlady and also observed the fact that the

                      respondent is the landlady of the said property, in which, the

                      first and the second respondents are the tenants in the said

                      property for nearly 30 years ago and the said schedule

                      property is also in a very dilapidated and dangerous condition

                      and the respondent/landlady has also obtained permission

                      from the Municipality on 16.04.2004 for making a new

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                                      6</span>

                      construction. Hence, the respondent/landlady has sought for

                      possession   of the   vacant   property    for   the    purpose    of

                      demolition and reconstruction of the same.             Whereas, the

                      petitioners/tenants are very much questioning the ownership

                      of the landlady regarding the rented building and in the

                      appeal, the petitioners, who are the tenants is very much

                      disputing the relationship between the tenants and landlord

                      and the said petition is filed only with the malafide intention.



</p><p id="p_9">                           7.In the appeal, the petitioners, who are the tenants

                      herein has contended that the Rent Control Authority,

                      Madurai, has wrongly given a finding that the age of the

                      petition mentioned property is nearly 106 years. Further, the

                      entire building has been entered into a sale agreement by the

                      landlady and the Commissioner report was not filed before the

                      Principal Rent Control Authority, Madurai, regarding the

                      status of the property. The Rent Control Authority has also

                      observed that already a suit in O.S.No.207 of 2004 was filed by

                      the tenants against the landlady and the said suit was

                      dismissed, against which, First Appeal was preferred before

                      this Court in A.S.(MD)No.94 of 2012 by the first respondent
http://www.judis.nic.in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                                     7</span>

                      and the same is pending. It is also observed that there is a

                      dispute over the ownership of the property among the

                      landlady and other parties. The Rent Control authority has

                      also observed that the landlady has become the person, who is

                      entitled for the suit property as per the 'Will' and the

                      settlement deed. Hence, the Rent Control authority as well as

                      the Rent Control Appellate Authority have not very much

                      discussed about the owner ship of the property, since the only

                      relationship   between   the   petitioner     herein    and    the

                      respondents as owner and tenants of the property. The rental

                      receipts were marked before the Principal Rent Control

                      Authority, Madurai, as Ex.R.4 to Ex.R.25. The petitioner, who

                      also claiming right in the said property, has filed Ex.P.1 and

                      Ex.P.2 are the documents relating to the property tax receipts,

                      which stands in the name of the petitioner. The other

                      respondents before the Principal Rent Controller Authority,

                      Madurai, have admitted that the suit schedule property

                      belongs to the landlady and they are also tenants in the suit

                      property. Hence, it is also proved before the Rent Control

                      Appellate Authority that the appellants/tenants, who are

                      already   tenants    under     the   father     of     the    first

                      respondent/landlady. Hence, the owner ship of the property is

                      very much proved. The other aspect regarding the condition of

                      the building is that even in the objections raised by the

                      tenants, the first respondent/landlady admitted that they are

                      the tenants in the suit property for nearly 30 years and the

                      age of the building is more than 106 years, which is also in a

                      very dilapidated condition.

</p><p id="p_11">                           8.The only contention raised by the petitioners/tenants

                      herein is that no Commissioner has been appointed to assess

                      the condition and age of the building. It is also observed that

                      the landlady at present is residing in a small house and in

                      future, she needs a house for her son and daughter-in-law for

                      their better accommodation, since the present one is not

                      suitable for a big family. Further, it is contended that the

                      landlady has sufficient means to construct a new house. In

                      view of the admissions made in her evidence regarding the

                      requirement of the property, she needs the said building for

                      demolition and reconstruction and the age of the building is

                      also found to be 106 years, the Rent Control Appellate

                      Authority confirmed the order of the Rent Control Authority

                      and dismissed the said R.C.A. Aggrieved against the order

                      passed in the R.C.A., the petitioners/tenants herein have

                      preferred this Civil Revision Petition.

</p><p id="p_13">                           9.In the grounds, the petitioners/tenants have stated that

                      the Court below has not appreciated the fact that the first

                      respondent had not produced any Engineers Report or seek

                      for appointment of an commissioner to assess the condition

                      and age of the building. The period of tenancy is also not

                      considered by the Court below whether the building needs any

                      demolition and reconstruction is also not properly assessed by

                      the Rent Control Authority and hence, the dismissal of the said

                      petition is not a proper one. The financial capacity of the first

                      respondent/landlady is also not appreciated by the Rent

                      Controller in a proper way. The Court below has also not

                      considered the fact that the landlady is not the absolute owner

                      of the entire property for filing such an eviction petition. The

                      other ground is relating to the sale agreement entered into

                      between      the     petitioners/tenants    and      the    first

                      respondent/landlady.

</p><p id="p_15">                           10.The grievance raised by the petitioners herein is that

                      any order of reversal in A.S.No.94 of 2012 would completely

                      vitiates the entire appeal, when the appeal is pending against

                      the same subject property and any orders from this Court will

                      not be fruitful when there is no existence of building. The

                      Court below has also failed to see that there is no need for the

                      first respondent to evict the petitioners on the ground of

                      demolition and reconstruction and no document has been

                      produced by the landlady to prove the fact that the building is

                      more than 106 years old. It is further contended that he is

                      paying   the   rent   regularly    and   also   produced   various

                      documents to prove that there is no wilful default on the part

                      of the petitioners/tenants. The description of the property

                      mentioned in the petition is also incorrect. Further, the stand

                      taken by the landlady in RCOP as well as the suit in O.S.No.

                      207 of 204, are different. Hence, on the whole, the petitioners,

                      who are the tenants have preferred the Civil Revision Petition

                      to set aside the judgment and decree passed in R.C.A.No.30 of

                      2016 dated 15.11.2018. The Rent Control Authority also

                      observed the same that there is a clear admission by the

                      landlady that the petitioners are the tenants in the suit

                      property for nearly 30 years and they have also tenants under

                      the father of the first respondent/landlady and they are also

                      making regular payment, which proves that the petitioners are

                      tenants under the first respondent/landlady. Though the

                      petitioners herein have stated regarding the right of the

                      landlady in the property, it is very well proved before the Rent

                      Controller Authority that the petitioners herein are the

                      tenants under the landlady for number of years and that is

                      also    proved   by    paying   the   rent   regularly   to   the

                      respondent/landlady.

                      age of the building or the condition of the building, when it is

                      stated by the first respondent/landlady that the age of the

                      building is 106 years and it is for the petitioners herein to

                      disprove the fact that they could have taken any steps for the

                      said appointment of an Advocate Commissioner regarding the

                      condition of the property. When the landlady assessed the age

                      of the building and required the same for demolition and

                      reconstruction, it has to be denied by the petitioners/tenants

                      that they have taken steps for assessing the condition of the

                      property by approaching the Court by way of appointment of

                      an Advocate commissioner. Hence, the averments of the first

                      respondent/landlady stands that it is an age-old building,

                      which required demolition and reconstruction. Regarding the

                      financial capacity of the landlady also very much questioned

                      by the petitioners/tenants, for which, the petitioners state that

                      she has also obtained permission from the Municipality and

                      regarding the financial status of the landlady are to be proved

                      before the Court. There are number of decisions which would

                      show that the person, who is the owner of the building, who

                      requires the building for demolition and reconstruction have

                      to prove his financial capacity before the Court. Further, the

                      financial    requirements   of    the    landlady    regarding   the

                      occupation of the building for the convenience of his son and

                      daughter-in-law is very much considered by the Rent Control

                      Authority.   These   aspects     of    requirement   made   by   the

                      petitioner has not been denied by the tenants.

</p><p id="p_18">                           12.Once the petitioners/tenants admitted their tenancy

                      under the first respondent/landlady and in the absence of

                      disproving the fact that the petition mentioned property

                      requires   demolition   and    reconstruction,   the   genuine

                      requirements as stated by the landlady has to be accepted.

                      The landlady, who is the first respondent has also deposed

                      before the Rent Control Tribunal that the building is in a very

                      damaged condition and during rainy season water is laying in

                      the building and there are number of cracks and it is very

                      much dangerous for the public cause on the existence of a

                      very dangerous building. The permission was granted by the

                      Madurai Corporation on 16.04.2004 for demolition of the said

                      construction. Hence, there is no interference is required in the

                      order of the Rent Control Appellate Authority, which confirms

                      the order of the Rent Control Authority wherein, the

                      relationship of the petitioners and the first respondent is as

                      owner and tenants and the requirement of the first respondent

                      is also found to be a genuine and fair one. While considering

                      the condition of the petition mentioned property, for which,

                      the landlady seeks for eviction for the purpose of demolition

                      and reconstruction.
