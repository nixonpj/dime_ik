               (LAXXMAN PRASAD BAIGA Vs THE NEW INDIA ASSURANCE)
16-04-2015

Shri V.D.S.Chouhan,        learned Counsel for the petitioner.

Ms. Shaheen Fatima, learned G.A., for the respondents-State.</pre>


<p id="p_1">The petitioner claims grant of regular pay scale from the initial date of appointment. The benefit is
claimed by the petitioner in the light of the order passed by the Division Bench at Indore Bench of
this Court, in W.A.No.346/2008 (Smt. Usha Ranawat Vs. State of M.P.and others), dated
18.12.2008. By the aforesaid order passed, more than 25 writ appeals claiming similar benefits
were decided and it was directed that the benefit of pay fixation in the regular pay scale from the
initial date of appointment shall be made to the petitioner therein. In fact the Division Bench has
upheld the orders passed by the learned Single Judge in various cases and while deciding the writ
appeals in para-19 the following directions were issued by the Division Bench:-
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_1">           â19. In view of the foregoing discussion, the appeal filed by writ petitioner
           succeeds and is allowed whereas writ appeals filed by the State are dismissed in
           limine. Impugned order of Single Bench is modified to the extent that appellant
           (writ petitioner) in addition to all benefits awarded by the Single Judge in the
           impugned order would also be entitled to claim arrears of his salary from the date
           of his initial appointment. In other words, the appellant will be entitled to claim the
           benefit of his pay fixation i.e. regular pay scale from the date of his initiate
           appointment. Let the calculation be made by


           respondents in the light of appellantâs date of initial appointment and
           accordingly, the arrears payable to appellant towards his salary be paid to him/her
           in each case, which are subject matter of these appeals within a period of 6
           months from the date of this order.â



It is seen that the point involved in this petition has already been put to rest by the Tribunal long
back in Madhukant Yadu Vs. State of Madhya Pradesh, in O.A.No. 2745/1989, decided on
24.08.1992. Said decision was assailed by the State Government by preferring an SLP before the
Apex Court, which was registered as SLP No.6892/1993 and the same has been dismissed on
03.01.1999. Later on, the Principal Seat as well as the Benches at Gwalior and Indore have
decided hundreds of petitions in the light of the said decision and, therefore, there is no reason
why petitioner can be deprived of the benefit, which was extended in the case of Madhukant
Yadu to similarly other co-employees.
</blockquote>

<p id="p_2">This Court also in a Division Bench decision in the case of State of MP and others Vs. Beni
Singh Rathod, W.P. No.648/2002, decided on 01.05.2002, has also affirmed the aforesaid
 decision, which is also applicable in this petition.
</p>

<p id="p_3">At this juncture, I may profitably refer to the Single Bench decision of this Court in the case of
Rajendra Kumar Pande and five others Vs. State of M.P. and others, in W.P. 8928/2003,
decided on 21.04.2004, wherein the decision of Madhukant Yadu which was affirmed by the
Supreme Court, was followed and all the objections which were raised by the respondents were
not accepted.
</p>

<p id="p_4">In view of the above and the judgment delivered in the case as referred to herein above, this
petition is allowed. The respondents are directed to extend the benefit of regular scale of pay
granting the benefit of notional pay fixation since initial date of appointment of the petitioner
within a period of three months from the date of communication of this order.
</p>

<p id="p_5">Even though this Court had been following the law laid down in the case of Smt. Usha Ranawat
(supra) , in various cases, and directed only for notional pay fixation and had refused arrears of
pay on the ground that the petitioner have approached this Court belatedly. It is seen from the
records that one such order passed by this Court in Writ Petition No. 9564/2010 (Smt. Saroj
Shah Vs. State of MP) which was assailed before a Division Bench of this Court in an intra Court
appeal, the learned Division Bench vide order dated 28.07.2010, passed in W.A. No.744/2010,
after taking note of the principles laid down in the case of Bir Bajrang Kumar Vs. State of
Bihar and others, AIR 1987 SC 1345, has held that similar benefit could not be denied to the
petitioner and has directed for extending similar benefits to the petitioner, as has been ordered in
the case of Smt. Usha Ranawat (supra) , in the matter of payment of arrears also.
</p>

<p id="p_6">Keeping in view the aforesaid, respondents are directed to extend to the petitioner the benefit of
pay fixation as has been extended in the case of Smt. Usha Ranawat (supra), with regard to
payment of arrears and other benefits also.
</p>

<p id="p_7">However, if on examination respondents find that for any reason whatsoever, the benefit cannot
be extended, they shall record such reasons and communicate it to the petitioner.
</p>

<p id="p_8">The petition stands allowed and disposed of with the aforesaid.
</p>

<p id="p_9">C.C.as per rules.
</p>


<p id="p_10">                                                                  (SHANTANU KEMKAR)
                                                                              JUDGE
