   having one TSR bearing No. DL­1RF­7472 which was surrendered 
   by him and in lieu thereof, he purchased another TSR bearing no. 
   DL­1RL­5487 in the month of August 2009 through the defendant 
   no.1. That plaintiff sold his old TSR to defendant no.1 and 2 against 
   total   sale   consideration   of   Rs.2,35,000/­   and   TSR   bearing   no. 
   DL­1RL­5478 was purchased by the plaintiff from defendant no.1 
   and   2   against   the   total   sale   consideration   of   Rs.4,65,000/.   After 
   adjusting the payment of Rs.2,35,000/­ the remaining amount i.e. 
   Rs.2,30,000/­   was   to   be   paid   by   the   plaintiff   to   the   defendants 
   alongwith   @16%   per   annum.   That   plaintiff   was   under   the 
   obligation to make the payment of Rs.12,650/­ per month to the 
   defendant no.1 and 2 for a period of 24 months. That plaintiff has 
   made all the payment to the defendants against receipt issued by 
   defendant. That after making the full payment, plaintiff requested 
   the   defendants   to   issue   No   Objection   Certificate   and   No   Dues 
   Certificate   to   get   the   HP/Lease   deleted   from   the   registration 
   certificate of the vehicle. That defendants started to avoiding the 
   same issue by one pretext or the other and obtained signatures of 
   the plaintiff on some blank printed forms as well as some blank 
   paper   assuring   him   that   they   will   complete   the   formality.    That 
   plaintiff surprised to see 2­3 muscles man who visited his house on 
   17.09.2012 for taking the possession  of the vehicle of the plaintiff. 
   That when plaintiff showed them all the payment receipt they said 
   that these receipts had not been account for and they will take the 
   possession of the vehicle if he will not make the payment. That on

   Anand Mai Marg, defendant no.2 alongwith his associates tried to 
   take the possession of the vehicle forcibly  but could not succeed 
   due to intervention of passerby. That driver of the plaintiff reported 
   the incident to the plaintiff who came at the spot and made call at 
   100   number   and   officials   of   PCR   asked   the   plaintiff   to   lodge   a 
   complaint in writing to SHO PS­Okhla Industrial Area. That when 
   plaintiff   visited   the   PS­Okhla   Industrial   Area   for   registering   his 
   complaint,   police   official   ignored   him   on   the   pretext   that   the 
   matter is a civil nature and did not register his complaint.  Hence, 
   the present suit is filed by the plaintiff.

   defendant no.2 appeared and filed his written statement denying 
   the allegations as contained in the plaint. That plaintiff has neither 
   paid EMIs nor surrendered the vehicle. That plaintiff has no locus 
   standi to sue the answering defendant no.2. That plaintiff has not 
   approached   this   Court   with   clean   hands   and   suppressed   the 
   material facts from this Court. Thus, on the above said grounds the 
   defendant no.2 prayed that the suit of the plaintiff be dismissed.
