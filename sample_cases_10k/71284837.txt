                     W.P.(C). No. 10856 of 2015
             =====================================================
                Dated this the 1st day of April, 2015

                               JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">      The petitioner, who is a registered dealer under the Kerala

Value Added Tax Act, is aggrieved by Ext.P6 notice issued to him

detaining a consignment of parts of a Crane, in knock-down

condition, that was being transported at the instance of the

petitioner. In the writ petition, the petitioner is aggrieved by the

insistence of the respondent that the petitioner must pay the

security deposit demanded in the detention notice as a condition

for release of the goods and vehicle.




</p><p id="p_2">      2.   I have heard the learned counsel appearing for the

petitioner and also the learned Government Pleader appearing for

the respondent.
</p>
<p id="p_3">


</p><p id="p_4">      3.    On a consideration of the facts and circumstances of the

case as also the submissions made across the bar, I dispose the

writ petition with the following directions:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">           (i) On a perusal of Ext.P6 notice, it is seen that the

           objection of the respondent is essentially with regard

           to the fact that the Form-16 declaration that

           accompanied the goods was not in electronic format.</blockquote><p id="p_5">

</p><p id="p_6">           It is also pointed out that there was no delivery note

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                        -2-</span>
W.P.(C). No. 10856 of 2015



               that accompanied the goods, which were stated to

               be transported pursuant to a stock transfer.

               Counsel for the petitioner would submit that there

               was a manual declaration in Form-16, and further

               relies    on Ext.P4   goods   transport   note,  that

               accompanied the consignment which contained all

               the relevant data as had to be contained in a

               delivery note, for the purposes of the KVAT Act. I

               also take into account the fact that the petitioner is

               a registered dealer and direct the respondent to

               release the goods and the vehicle covered by the

               detention notice, to the petitioner, on his executing

               a simple bond without sureties for the security

               deposit amount demanded in the notice, before the

               respondent.
</p>
<p id="p_7">
</p><p id="p_8">               (ii)   The respondent shall thereafter transmit the

               files to the adjudicating authority who shall

               adjudicate the matter and pass orders, after hearing

               the petitioner, within two months from the date of

               receipt of a copy of this judgment.
</p>
<p id="p_9">
</p><p id="p_10">               (iii)   The petitioner shall produce a copy of this

               judgment and a copy of the writ petition before the

               respondent.
