3   02-02-2012              Heard learned counsel for the petitioners and learned
                 counsel appearing on behalf of the State.
</p><p id="p_2">                            The petitioners have approached this Court by filing
                 the present petition under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_1">Section 482</a> of the Code of Criminal
                 Procedure seeking quashing of the order dated 4.9.2010 passed
                 in Complaint Case No. 1119( C) of 2010 by the learned Judicial
                 Magistrate, Ist Class, Patna, whereby cognizance under <a href="/doc/988620/" id="a_2">Section
                 406</a> of the Indian Penal Code has been taken and summons have
                 been issued against the accused persons for their appearance.
</p><p id="p_3">                            Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that the
                 order taking cognizance is barred by limitation and if there is
                 some dispute regarding non-execution of the sale deed by the
                 accused persons on the basis of an agreement to sale, then for
                 that the complainant ought to have filed a civil suit, but the
                 criminal prosecution is not maintainable. It is also contended
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1"> Patna High Court Cr.Misc. No.4509 of 2012 (3) dt.02-02-2012                       2</span>




                that though petitioner no.2 happens to be the wife of petitioner
                no.1 but she is not directly involved with respect to negotiation
                or agreement for transfer of the lands in question.
</p><p id="p_4">                              Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the State has
                opposed the prayer and has submitted that on the basis of
                materials available on record a prima facie case under <a href="/doc/988620/" id="a_3">Section
                406</a> of the Indian Penal Code is made out.
</p><p id="p_5">                              After having heard the parties and on perusal of the
                materials available on record, this Court finds that the
                petitioners are alleged to have entered into a negotiation for
                transfer of 3 kathas of lands to the complainant. Pursuant to the
                aforesaid negotiation, an agreement was also signed on
                16.1.2007. The petitioners are alleged to have taken altogether
                Rs. 2,70,000/- from the complainant with a promise to transfer
                the lands in question and thereafter despite legal notice and
                several reminders they refused either to return the money or
                execute a sale deed. Consequently, the aforesaid petition of
                complaint was filed by opposite party no.2.
</p><p id="p_6">                              The complainant was examined on S.A. and two
                witnesses were produced on behalf of the complainant during
                the course of enquiry. On the basis of materials available on
                record, the learned Magistrate came to a finding that a prima
                facie case under <a href="/doc/988620/" id="a_4">Section 406</a> of the Indian Penal Code is made
                out.
</p><p id="p_7">                              Under the mandate of <a href="/doc/686759/" id="a_5">Section 190</a> of the Code of
                Criminal Procedure, the court is required to take cognizance of
                an offence. The allegations against individual accused are not
                required to be discussed at that stage.
</p><p id="p_8">                              So far question of limitation is concerned, the cause
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">           Patna High Court Cr.Misc. No.4509 of 2012 (3) dt.02-02-2012                         3</span>




                          of action arose on the last date of refusal by the accused persons
                          either to return the money or to execute a sale deed. The petition
                          of complaint was filed on 24.4.2010 and cognizance has been
                          taken on 4.9.2010.Therefore, the plea raised on behalf of the
                          petitioners that the order taking cognizance is barred by
                          limitation appears to be misconceived. In view of the provision
                          under <a href="/doc/1249173/" id="a_6">Section 405</a> of the Indian Penal Code defining criminal
                          breach of trust and in view of the fact that money was entrusted
                          to the petitioners by the complainant for the purpose of transfer
                          of the        lands and the same              having been dishonestly
                          misappropriated by refusing either to return the money or to
                          execute a sale deed, prima facie a case under <a href="/doc/988620/" id="a_7">Section 406</a> of the
                          Indian Penal Code is made out. No other legal submission has
                          been made on behalf of the petitioners.
</p><p id="p_9">                                        This Court does not find any legal infirmity in the
                          order impugned. The application has to fail. Consequently, this
                          petition stands dismissed.
