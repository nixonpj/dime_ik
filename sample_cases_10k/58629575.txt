<pre id="pre_1">              HONOURABLE SRI JUSTICE SANJAY KUMAR

                    WRIT PETITION No.2970 of 2019

ORDER:
</pre>
<p id="p_1">        The prayer of the petitioners in this case reads as under:

         "For the reasons stated in the accompanying affidavit, it is
         hereby prayed that this Hon'ble Court may be pleased to
         issue an appropriate Writ, Order or Direction, more
         particularly one in the nature of Writ of Mandamus declaring
         the action of the 4th respondent in not issuing the Pattadar
         Pass books to the petitioners for the Agriculture land for an
         extent Acs.4-29 guntas in Sy.No.504/A, Acs.8-06 guntas in
         Sy.No,657, Acs.7-21 guntas in Sy.No.658, Acs.5.37 guntas in
         Sy.No.659, Acs.4-32 guntas in Sy.No.660/A, Acs.7. 00 guntas
         in Sy.No.661, Ac.1.10 guntas in Sy.No.662/A, Ac.0. 09 guntas
         in Sy.No.663/A, Ac.0.28 guntas Sy.No.666/A, Ac.0. 33 guntas
         in Sy.No.665, Ac.1.15 guntas in Sy.No.669/A and Ac.0.29
         guntas Sy.No.670/A, totalling to an extent of Acres.43.29
         guntas situated in Arutla Village, Manchal Mandal Ranga
         Reddy District as illegal, arbitrary, unconstitutional and
         contrary to provisions of the Telangana Rights in Land and
         Pattadar Pass Books Act 1971 and consequently direct the 4th
         respondent to issue Pattadar Pass books to the petitioners for
         the aforementioned lands and to pass such other order or
         orders as this Honourable Court may deem fit and proper in
         the facts and circumstances of the case."
</p>
<p id="p_2">        The petitioners are the legal heirs of late Parepally Rangaiah.

It is their claim that the name of Parepally Sathayya, the father of

late Parepally Rangaiah, was entered in the revenue records in

relation to various extents of land in different survey numbers of

Arutla Village, Manchal Mandal, Ranga Reddy District. Upon the

death    of Parepally      Rangaiah,      petitioner   No.1 submitted     an

application dated 16.7.2018 to the Tahsildar, Manchal Mandal,

Ranga Reddy District, to mutate her name along with the names of

her children in the revenue records in relation to the subject lands

and to issue pattadar passbooks and title deeds. Complaining of

inaction on the part of the Tahsildar, Manchal Mandal, Ranga Reddy

District, the present Writ Petition is filed.

</p><p id="p_3">        It is however to be noted that in terms of the Telangana

Rights in Land and Pattadar Pass Books Act, 1971 (for brevity, 'the
                                                                             SK, J
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                      2                        WP.No.2970 of 2019</span>
                                                                    Dt:15.02.2019




Act of 1971'), the petitioners would have to submit an application in

Form VI(A) for mutation and issuance of pattadar passbooks and

title deeds based on their claim of inheritance. Without following the

due procedure prescribed under the Act of 1971, it is not open to

the petitioners to come before this Court and complain of inaction

on the part of the revenue authorities.
</p>
<p id="p_4">          The Writ Petition is accordingly disposed of permitting the

petitioners to make an application in Form VI(A) as per the Act of

1971 along with the requisite fee seeking mutation and issuance of

pattadar passbooks and title deeds. In the event such an application

is made, the Tahsildar, Manchal Mandal, Ranga Reddy District, shall

take appropriate action expeditiously and in any event, not later

than four weeks from the date of receipt of such application.

</p><p id="p_5">          Pending Miscellaneous Petitions, if any, shall stand disposed of

in the light of this final order. No order as to costs.
