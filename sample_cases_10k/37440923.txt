<p id="p_1"> IN THE HIGH COURT OF JUDICATURE FOR RAJASTHAN AT JAIPUR BENCH 

ORDER

(SATYA NARAIN VS. STATE OF RAJASTHAN)
S.B. CR. MISC. SUSPENSION OF SENTENCE APPLI. NO.1017/2012
IN
S.B. CRIMINAL APPEAL NO.993/2012

Date of Order : 					      08.02.2013

HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE ALOK SHARMA

Mr. Anurag Sharma, for the accused-appellant.
</p><p id="p_2">Mr. Laxman Meena, Public Prosecutor for the State.
</p><p id="p_3">Mr. S.K. Jain, for the complainant.
</p>

<p id="p_4">1)		Heard the counsel for the accused-appellant and the complainant as also the learned Public Prosecutor.
</p><p id="p_5">2)		Mr. Anurag Sharma, appearing for the accused-appellant, submits that in para 43 of the impugned judgment dated 23.11.2012, passed by the Additional Session Judge, No.2, Bundi, there is specific finding that the complainant party was the aggressor. He further submits that Om Prakash (PW-4), Ram Charan (PW-5) and Bhuri Bai (PW-6) have all stated that on Bhuri Bai mother of the accused-appellants approaching the revenue court, the said court vide order dated 06.07.2010 had restrained the complainant party by way of a temporary injunction from interfering with the possession, use and enjoyment of the agricultural land in dispute belonging to Bhuri Bai and further not to take any steps to dispossess her therefrom. Counsel submits that the learned trial court having found from the prosecution evidence itself that the land belonged to Bhuri Bai, ought to have also found in favour of the accused-appellants their right to private defence of the property itself when the complainant party was the aggressor. It is submitted that the judgment dated 23.11.2012, passed by the trial court is even otherwise also vitiated by misdirection in law in invoking the concept of exceeding the right of private defence in a case under <a href="/doc/455468/" id="a_1">Section 307</a> IPC. He submits that the said principle of exceeding the right of private defence can only be invoked in cases covered under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_2">Section 302</a> IPC. It is further submitted that in view of the possession of the accused-appellants, the trial court acquitted them of charges under <a href="/doc/162506/" id="a_3">Section 447</a>, <a href="/doc/1258372/" id="a_4">147</a> and <a href="/doc/763672/" id="a_5">148</a> IPC. The submission of the counsel for the accused-appellant is that the further error in the judgment of the trial court is that without examination of the radiologist / surgeon, the trial court has come to a finding that the injury on the head of Janki Lal was sufficient in due course to cause death and find an offence under <a href="/doc/455468/" id="a_6">Section 307</a> IPC. It is submitted that Dr. Narottam Nuval (PW-10) in his cross-examination admitted that his opinion with regard to the injury on Janki Lal being dangerous to life or sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death was not based on his own opinion, but on the borrowed opinion of one Dr. Dharm Raj Meena, who was not examined by the prosecution as a witness before the trial court. He submits that absent the expert opinion of radiologist or surgeon with regard to the nature of injury on the head of Janki Lal, no finding on the medical aspect of the injuries could have been arrived at by the trial court itself donning the robes of an expert. It is submitted that in view of the multiple submissions aforesaid, the accused-appellant has a very substantial case to argue in appeal and hence during its pendency the sentence visited upon the accused inter alia for the offence under <a href="/doc/455468/" id="a_7">Section 307</a> IPC be suspended.
</p><p id="p_6">3)		Mr. S.K. Jain, appearing for the complainant, would, on the other hand, submit that the complainant party has filed a cross appeal against the judgment dated 23.11.2012, passed by the Additional Session Judge, No.2, Bundi. He submits that in the said appeal, the complainant party is seeking enhancement of sentence visited upon the accused-appellants as also the conviction of the other accused, acquitted by the trial court such as Raja Ram, Shyam Lal and Brahmanand. It is submitted that the accused-appellants were plainly guilty of forming an unlawful assembly with an intent to cause death and the finding of the trial court contrary thereto acquitting them of the offences under <a href="/doc/162506/" id="a_8">Sections 447</a>, <a href="/doc/1258372/" id="a_9">147</a> and <a href="/doc/763672/" id="a_10">148</a> IPC is erroneous. Counsel further submits that on the complainant's side, Janki Lal was inflicted a grievous injury on his head and Om Prakash was inflicted a grievous sharp weapon injury on his hand. The further submission is that the absence of the radiologist / surgeon in the witness box to give his expert opinion with regard to the nature of injuries on the complainant party is of no consequence because the trial court itself has the power to evaluate the nature of the injuries and come to a finding based thereon. He submits that in the facts of the case, this Court ought not to exercise its power under <a href="/doc/1116025/" id="a_11">Section 389(1)</a> Cr.P.C. to suspend the sentence of the accused-appellant, Satya Narain. 
</p><p id="p_7">4)		Having heard the counsel for the accused-appellant and the complainant as also learned Public Prosecutor, who has also opposed the application for suspension of sentence, I am of the considered opinion that in view of the evidence of the prosecution witnesses themselves that the accused-appellants and their mother were in possession, use and enjoyment of the agricultural land in issue over which the altercation took place and taking into consideration the fact that the radiologist / surgeon was not examined before the trial court and the opinion of the medical jurist about the injuries on the head of Janki Lal being dangerous and sufficient in the ordinary course to cause death was admittedly based on borrowed wisdom from Dr. Dharm Raj Meena, who was not examined in court, this application for suspension of sentence should be allowed.
</p><p id="p_8">5)		Consequently, the application for suspension of sentence is allowed. It is directed that sentence of imprisonment of the accused-appellant namely Satya Narain S/o Mool Chand, shall remain suspended during pendency of the appeal and he shall be released on bail provided, he furnishes a personal bond in the sum of Rs.25,000/- (Rupees Twenty Five Thousands) with one surety of the like amount to the satisfaction of the trial court to appear before this Court on 08.03.2013 and as and when he is called upon to do so.
