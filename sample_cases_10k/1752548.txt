                     Crl Misc Case No. 367 (B) of 2010

Suresh Kumar                                                     Applicant
                                       Vs
State of U.P.                                                    Opp. Party

Hon'ble Raj Mani Chauhan, J.
</pre><p id="p_1">     Heard learned counsel for the applicant and learned A.G.A. for the
State.
</p><p id="p_2">         The accused-applicant Suresh Kumar is involved and detained in Case
Crime No. 620 of 2009, under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_1">Section 302</a> I.P.C., from Police Station
Pasgawan, District Lakhimpur Kheri.
</p><p id="p_3">         The submission of learned counsel for the applicant is that the FIR of
the occurrence was lodged by Jagan Nath, who is real uncle of the accused,
against unknown persons. It has been alleged in the FIR that Smt Ram
Kumari, mother of the accused, on the date of occurrence had gone to her
field for harvesting the Chana (Gram) crops. At about 12.00 in the noon
unknown persons went to her field and caused her death. During the course
of investigation, name of accused applicant and his wife came into light. The
motive against the accused is that the mother of accused wanted to gift her
landed property to her daughter and sons-in-law. Accused being son was,
therefore, bearing enmity with her, but the sons-in-law of the deceased have
stated that the deceased had never showed her intention to give her landed
property to them. Accused being son of the deceased had took her to hospital
for treatment. The Investigating Officer examined four witnesses who are
said to be eye witness of the occurrence. The first witness is Sankalp Shukla
who was examined on 08.06.2009, second witness is Nankhey, who was
examined on 17.06.2009, third witness is Shyamu Tiwari, who was examined
on 09.08.2009 and fourth witness is Sadhu who was examined on 09.08.2009
by the Investigating Officer. Although these witnesses have specifically
stated that the accused had caused the death to his mother, but the
Investigating Officer has examined these witnesses after a long delay which
has not been explained by him. In fact the deceased had not been done to
death by the accused. The accused applicant has falsely been implicated by
the Investigating Officer at the instance of his opponents. The accused
applicant has got no criminal history. He, therefore, deserves to be released
on bail.
</p><p id="p_4">         Learned A.G.A opposed the bail application.
</p><p id="p_5">         Considered the submissions of the learned counsel for the applicant
 and the learned Additional Government Advocate. Keeping in view the
totality of the facts and circumstances of the case, without expressing any
opinion on the merits of the case, applicant may be released on bail.
</p><p id="p_6">        Let applicant Suresh Kumar be released on bail in aforesaid case
crime number on his furnishing a personal bond with two sureties each in the
like amount to the satisfaction of the court concerned.
