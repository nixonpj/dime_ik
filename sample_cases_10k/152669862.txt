                 R/SCR.A/5144/2014                                            CAV JUDGMENT




                                       CAV JUDGMENT

         1.     By this application under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_1">Article 227</a> of the Constitution of
         India, the applicants-original accused persons call in question
         the legality and validity of the order dated 25th November,
         2014 passed by the            Additional Sessions Judge, Court No.3,
         Ahmedabad in the Criminal Revision Application No.298 of
         2014 by which the learned Judge partly allowed the application
         setting aside the order passed by the learned Additional Chief
         Metropolitan Magistrate, Court No.15, Ahmedabad in the
         Criminal Case No.304 of 2014 dated 5.7.2014 and at the same
         time directing the Maninagar Police Station to undertake
         investigation of the complaint filed by the respondent No.2
         herein (original complainant) under <a href="/doc/99487/" id="a_2">section 156(3)</a> of the Code
         of Criminal Procedure and file an appropriate report before the
         trial court within a period of 90 days.


         2.     The facts of the case may be summarized as under:


         2.1    The respondent No.2 herein lodged a private complaint
         in the court of the learned Additional Chief Metropolitan
         Magistrate, Court No.15, Ahmedabad against the applicants
         herein for the offence punishable under <a href="/doc/988620/" id="a_3">sections 406</a>, <a href="/doc/1436241/" id="a_4">420</a>,
         <a href="/doc/1326844/" id="a_5">409</a>, <a href="/doc/1317063/" id="a_6">465</a>, <a href="/doc/556166/" id="a_7">468</a>, <a href="/doc/1827979/" id="a_8">469</a>, <a href="/doc/1466184/" id="a_9">471</a>, <a href="/doc/886598/" id="a_10">365</a>, <a href="/doc/455468/" id="a_11">307</a>, <a href="/doc/1243353/" id="a_12">342</a>, <a href="/doc/1128948/" id="a_13">120(B)</a> and <a href="/doc/1198799/" id="a_14">294(b)</a> of
         the Indian Penal Code. The complainant prayed that the
         complaint be sent for police investigation through the P.I. of
         the Maninagar Police Station under <a href="/doc/99487/" id="a_15">section 156(3)</a> of the Code
         of Criminal Procedure, 1973. However, it appears that the
         learned Metropolitan Magistrate thought fit to take cognizance
         upon     the      complaint    after    recording         verification           of    the



                                           Page 2 of 11

HC-NIC                                   Page 2 of 11     Created On Thu Sep 24 01:53:22 IST 2015
                R/SCR.A/5144/2014                                       CAV JUDGMENT



         complainant on oath. It appears that the learned Magistrate,
         thereafter, ordered police inquiry under <a href="/doc/162723/" id="a_16">section 202</a> of the
         Code. On receipt of the report of the police as regards the
         inquiry, the learned Magistrate thought fit to issue process
         under <a href="/doc/1905618/" id="a_17">section 204</a> of the Code for the offence enumerated
         above.


         2.2   The applicants herein, being dissatisfied with the order
         passed by the learned Metropolitan Magistrate dated 5.7.2014,
         preferred the Criminal Revision Application No.298 of 2014
         challenging the legality and validity of the order passed by the
         learned Magistrate.


         2.3   It was argued before the Revisional Court that the entire
         procedure which was adopted by the learned Magistrate was
         contrary to the provisions<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_18"> of the Code</a> of Criminal Procedure
         inasmuch as the learned Metropolitan Magistrate could not
         have issued process for the offence under <a href="/doc/455468/" id="a_19">section 307</a> of the
         Indian Penal Code which is a sessions triable offence in the
         absence of proper inquiry under <a href="/doc/162723/" id="a_20">section 202</a> of the Code. The
         principal argument of the applicants before the Revisional
         Court was that the learned Magistrate could not have ordered
         investigation under <a href="/doc/162723/" id="a_21">section 202</a> of the Code through police
         since the offence complained of is triable exclusively by the
         court of sessions. It was also argued that the proviso to sub-
         section (2) to <a href="/doc/162723/" id="a_22">section 202</a> of the Code provides that if it
         appears to the Magistrate that the offence complained of is
         triable exclusively by the court of sessions, then he shall call
         upon the complainant to produce all his witnesses and
         examine them on oath.

HC-NIC                             Page 3 of 11     Created On Thu Sep 24 01:53:22 IST 2015
                R/SCR.A/5144/2014                                       CAV JUDGMENT



         2.4   The Revisional Court accepted both the contentions and
         in my view very rightly as the position of law is very well
         settled. However, while quashing the order passed by the
         learned Metropolitan Magistrate, the learned Sessions Judge
         exceeded its jurisdiction by ordering police investigation under
         <a href="/doc/833310/" id="a_23">section 156(3)</a> of the Code read with <a href="/doc/1865117/" id="a_24">section 397</a> of the Code.


         2.5   The operative part of the impugned order reads thus;


               "23. Consequence upon the above discussion, the
               following order is passed in the interest of justice.

                                                  ORDER

               and Mr.Devendrakumar R. Sharma, is hereby partly
               allowed.

<p id="p_2">               2.    Under <a href="/doc/1457888/" id="a_25">Section 397</a> of the Criminal Procedure Code,
               the order passed by the Learned Additional Chief
               Metropolitan Magistrate, Court No.15, Ahmedabad, in
               Criminal Case No.304/2014 dated 05.07.2014 is hereby
               set aside.

<p id="p_3">               3.    Under <a href="/doc/1865117/" id="a_26">Section 397</a> read with <a href="/doc/99487/" id="a_27">Section 156(3)</a> of the

               complaint filed by the complainant Nagesh N. Sharma be
               sent for the police investigation to Maninagar Police

</p><p id="p_7">         3.   Mr. Umesh Trivedi, the learned counsel appearing for the
         applicants vehemently submitted that the impugned order is
         erroneous. He submitted that the learned Sessions Judge has
         no powers to direct police investigation under <a href="/doc/833310/" id="a_28">section 156</a> (3)<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_29">
         of the Code</a> read with <a href="/doc/1865117/" id="a_30">section 397</a> of the Code. He submitted
         that after quashing the order passed by the learned Additional
         Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, the learned Sessions Judge
         should have remitted the matter to the trial court with
         appropriate directions to proceed further with the complaint in
         accordance with law. Mr. Trivedi submitted that the impugned
         order, being without jurisdiction, is a nullity and therefore the
         same be quashed.
</p>

<p id="p_8">         4.   On the other hand, this application has been vehemently
         opposed by Mr. Bhadrish Raju, the learned counsel appearing
         for the respondent No.2-original complainant. He submitted
         that no error, not to speak of any error of law could be said to
         have been committed by the learned Additional Sessions Judge
         in passing the impugned order. He submitted that having
         regard to the peculiar facts of the case and the nature of the
         allegations leveled by the complainant in his complaint, the
         learned Sessions Judge rightly ordered police investigation
         under <a href="/doc/833310/" id="a_31">section 156(3)</a> of the Code as it is only the police who
         could have undertaken effective investigation and the court
         could not have gone into the issues raised in the complaint
         without proper investigation. He, therefore, submitted that this
         application, being devoid of any merit, the same be rejected.

         adopted the submissions of Mr. Raju and submitted that no
         error, not to speak of any error of law could be said to have
         been committed by the learned Sessions Judge.

</p>
<p id="p_16">         8.   A bare perusal of the section itself indicates that                                  in a
         complaint which prima facie discloses an offence exclusively
         triable by the court of sessions, then in such circumstances,
         the Magistrate has no power to direct police investigation
         under <a href="/doc/162723/" id="a_35">section 202</a> of the Code. In a case where it appears to
         the Magistrate that the offence complaint of is triable
         exclusively by the court of sessions, then he shall have to call
         upon the complainant to produce all his witnesses and
         examine      them        on   oath.     After        the     examination             of    the
         complainant and his witnesses, the learned Magistrate may,
         thereafter, take an appropriate decision whether to issue
         process or not.

<p id="p_17">         9.   In the present case, the learned Sessions Judge, as
         observed earlier, rightly came                   to the conclusion that the
         procedure adopted by the learned Metropolitan Magistrate was
         not in accordance with law and rightly quashed the order
         passed     by the learned Metropolitan Magistrate.                               However,
         after quashing the order passed by the learned Metropolitan
         Magistrate, the learned Sessions Judge should have stopped at
         that stage. At best, the learned Sessions Judge should have
         remitted the matter to the learned Magistrate with appropriate
         directions to proceed further in accordance with law.

<p id="p_24">         14.    A Court of Sessions is under <a href="/doc/1633827/" id="a_46">section 6</a> clearly                           a Court
         quite differentiated from the Court of a Magistrate. <a href="/doc/308396/" id="a_47">Section 193</a>
         also inter alia makes this quite plain. A Sessions Court is not a
         Magistrate empowered under <a href="/doc/276703/" id="a_48">section 190</a>. No other section or
         provision<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_49"> of the Code</a> gives a Sessions Court power to order
         such an enquiry.

<p id="p_25">         15.    Next question to be considered is whether, In the
         absence of power under<a href="/doc/903398/" id="a_50"> S. 482</a>, a Court of Session has got any
         inherent power to order such investigation? It was argued by
         the learned Public Prosecutor that all Courts can exercise such
         inherent powers to do justice as are preserved expressly or are
         not taken away by a Statute as observed by the Supreme

         (1964 (1) Cri LJ 1) (See para 17). But, the Supreme Court in
         <a href="/doc/1293189/" id="a_52">Bindeshwari Prasad Singh v. Kali Singh</a>, AIR 1977 SC 2432 :
         (1978 Cri LJ 187) held that inherent powers of the High Court is
         only protected and in the absence of a power under Section
         151 of the Code of Civil Procedure to Civil Courts, subordinate
         criminal Courts have no inherent powers. Despite the decision
         of the Supreme Court in the above case, divergent views are
         expressed by certain High Courts regarding the powers of the
         sub-ordinate criminal Courts in exercising inherent powers
         without an enabling section like <a href="/doc/903398/" id="a_53">Section 482</a> (previous <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_54">Section
         561-A</a>). But, it is settled law that such inherent powers cannot
         be exercised by any criminal Court if there is an express or
         implied bar in<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_55"> the Code</a> of Criminal Procedure itself or in any
         other Statute. The Supreme Court considered the matter with
         regard to the power of review in criminal matters. <a href="/doc/390542/" id="a_56">Section 362</a>
         of the Code mandates that no Court, when it has signed its
         judgment or final order disposing of a criminal case, shall alter
         or review the same except to correct a clerical or arithmetical
         error. The Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/1474198/" id="a_57">Hari Singh Mann v. Harbhajan
         Singh Bajwa</a>, 2000 AIR SCW 3848 : (2001 Cri LJ 128) held that
         even the High Court cannot invoke<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_58"> S. 561-A</a> (present<a href="/doc/903398/" id="a_59"> S. 482</a>)
         for exercise of inherent powers to correct a mistake which is
         specifically prohibited by<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_60"> the Code</a>.

         Additional Sessions Judge insofar as it directed the Maninagar
         Police Station to undertake investigation of the complaint filed
         by the complainant under <a href="/doc/833310/" id="a_61">section 156(3)</a> read with <a href="/doc/1865117/" id="a_62">section 397</a>

         The submission of Mr. Raju that this option may be left to the
