                      WP No. 3940 of 2016
25/10/2016

      Shri Rishabh Sethi learned counsel for petitioner.
      Shri P. Pal learned counsel for respondents.</pre>
<p id="p_1">      Heard finally with consent.
</p><p id="p_2">      This writ petition has been filed by petitioner challenging the
order dated 17/12/2008 by which the earlier order dated 14/5/96
granting the pay scale of Rs. 750-945/- has been cancelled.
</p><p id="p_3">      Counsel for petitioner at the outset has submitted that the
issue involved in the present case is squarely covered by the order
dated 8th October 2010 passed in WP No. 7901/2010 in the matter of
Suresh Chandra Hirve Vs. State of Madhya Pradesh and others.
</p><p id="p_4">      Counsel for State has not disputed the aforesaid aspect of the
matter.
</p><p id="p_5">      This court in the matter of Suresh Chandra Hirve (supra) had
passed following orders:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">      1.    "The petitioner before this court has filed this present
     petition claiming regular pay scale. i.e. pay scale of Rs.
     750-945/- w.e.f. 14.05.1996 and is also aggrieved by order
     dated 17.12.2008 (Annexure P-10) by which the claim of
     the petitioner for regular pay scale has been turned down.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">     2.     The contention of the petitioner is that he was
     appointed by an order dated 31.08.90 as a daily wager on
     the post of Choukidar and after completion of five year's of
     service, the case of the petitioner was considered by
     respondents for grant of regular pay scale keeping in view
     the circular issued by the State Government dated
     17.03.1978. The petitioner further stated that a Screening
     Committee was constituted by the Department to consider
     the cases of daily wagers and an order was passed
     granting regular pay scale of Rs. 750-945/- on 14.05.1996.</blockquote>
<p id="p_6">     The petitioner further stated that as            many as 68
     employees were granted regular pay scale, however, the
     order in respect of the petitioner was kept in abeyance on
     29.6.1996 by the Collector and the order was later on
     cancelled by the State Government on 8th October 2004
     (Annexure P/3). The petitioner's contention is that in the
     order passed by the State Government the solitary reason
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                                                    2</span>

assigned was that the petitioner was appointed after
31.12.1988 and, therefore, he was not entitled for
regularization as well as for grant of regular pay scale.
</p><p id="p_7">3.     Learned counsel for the petitioner has also brought
to the notice of this court that the order dated 8 th October,
2004 (annexure p/3) was subjected to judicial scrutiny in a
writ petition i.e. WP no.1512 of 2004 filed by one Baliram
Baghel and the writ petition filed by Baliram Baghel was
allowed on 14th September,2005. The impugned order
passed by the State Government dated 8th October,2004
was also quashed. Learned counsel for the petitioner has
further submitted before this Court that a writ appeal was
preferred by the State of Madhya Pradesh and the same
was registered as writ appeal No. 128 of 2006. The
Division Bench of this Court has dismissed the writ appeal
by passing an order on 11.11.2006. A SLP was also
preferred in the matter and the Apex Court has also
dismissed the SLP preferred by the State of Madhya
Pradesh.
</p><p id="p_8">4.     A writ petition was preferred by the petitioner i.e. writ
petition No.6012/09(s) and the same was disposed of by
this Court by an order dated 27.08.09. This Court while
quashing order dated 08.10.2008 also observed that the
petitioner would be entitled for the benefits accrued to him
by virtue of order dated 14.05.1996 till the fresh decision is
taken in the matter. The petitioner thereafter submitted
representation to the respondents and as nothing was
being done a contempt petition was preferred and the
same was registered as contempt petition No.906 of 2009
and the same was disposed of by an order dated 21.12.09
directing the respondents to comply with order dated
02.09.2008 on or before 20.03.2009.
</p><p id="p_9">5.     The petitioner further stated that in the meanwhile a
show-cause notice was issued to the petitioner on
05.08.2008 and thereafter the respondents have passed an
order dated 17.12.2008 by which the order granting reqular
pay scale to the petitioner has been cancelled. The
petitioner is aggrieved by the aforesaid order.
</p><p id="p_10">6.     Learned counsel for the petitioner has also argued
before this Court that large number of employees, who are
identically placed like Baliram Baghel, petitioner of W.P.
No.1512 of 2004, are receiving the regular pay scale and,
therefore, the action of the respondents in discriminating
the petitioner is violative of Articles 14,16 and 21 of the
Constitution of India. It has also been argued before this
Court that Baliram Baghel an identically placed person, is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                                                  3</span>

being paid regular pay scale.
</p><p id="p_11">7.     A reply has been filed on behalf respondents-State
and the respondents-State has admitted that the petitioner
was appointed as Choukidar and the respondents have
also admitted issuance of order dated 14.05.1996 by which
pay scale of Rs.750-945/- was granted to the present
petitioner along with one Baliram Baghel. The contention
of the respondents-State is that the circular dated
17.03.1978 has been withdrawn by the State Government
and another circular has been issued by the respondents-
State dated 09.01.1990 (annexure R/3) and, therefore, the
petitioner as he was appointed after 31.12.1988 is not
entitled for regularisation and is also not entitled for grant
of regular pay scale.
</p><p id="p_12">8.     The respondents-State further submitted that in the
matter of Baliram Baghel as no opportunity of hearing was
granted to Shri Baliram Baghel, the order passed by State
Government dated 8th October,2004 was set aside by this
Court by an order dated 14.09.2005 and as there was an
order in favour of Baliram Baghel they were left with no
choice except to give regular pay scale to Shri Baliram
Baghel.
</p><p id="p_13">9.     Learned Government Advocate vehemently argued
before this Court that the case of the petitioner is
distinguishable on facts, as in the case of petitioner they
have issued show-cause notice and after hearing the
petitioner, they have passed the impugned order dated
17.12.2008.
</p><p id="p_14">10. Learned Government Advocate for respondent-State
vehemently argued before this court that by virtue of
circular dated 09.01.1990 and keeping in view the
judgment delivered by the Apex Court in the case of State
of Karnatak Vs. Uma Devi, petitioner is not entitled for
regularisation as also for grant of regular pay scale and the
present writ petition deserves to be dismissed.
</p><p id="p_15">11.      Heard leaned counsel for the parties at length and
perused the record.
</p><p id="p_16">12. In the present case, it is an admitted fact that the
petitioner was appointed as Choukidar under the
contingency establishment as a daily wager by an order
dated 31.08.90. It is also an admitted fact that the
petitioner was considered for grant of regular pay scale and
not for regularisation by the Screening Committee
constituted by the Department and an order was passed on
14.05.1996 granting regular pay scale of Rs.750-945/- to
the petitioner along with 68 other employees. The order
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                                               4</span>

was stayed by the Collector on 29.06.1996 and finally it
was cancelled by State government on 8th October 2004
and the reason assigned in the aforesaid order of the State
government was that the petitioner as he was appointed
after 31.12.1988 was not entitled for regularisation. One
Baliram Baghel, who was also a beneficiary of regular pay
scale, which was granted to him by virtue of order dated
14.05.1996 came up before this Court and this Court in the
case of Baliram Baghel has passed the following order:-
</p>
<p id="p_17">      ''This order shall also govern the field of writ
  petition No.5968/2003(OA.1019/96) and W.P.(s)
  No.1514 of 2004.
</p>
<p id="p_18">   2. The contention of the learned counsel for the
   petitioner is that earlier the petitioner was appointed
   as contingency paid employee. Later on vide order
   dated 14.5.96 his services were reguralised and he
   was directed to be paid the regular pay scale of
   Rs.750-945/-. The contention of learned counsel for
   petitioner is that the order of regularisation was
   issued on the basis of completion of five years
   contingency paid employees. Thereafter, without
   issuing any show cause notice by stroke of pen, all of
   a sudden on 08-10-2004, the order of regularisation
   dated 14-5-96 has been cancelled. As a result of
   which the petitioner has again become contingency
   paid employee.
</p><p id="p_19">    3. There is merit in the contention of Shri Sethi,
    learned counsel for the petitioner that after having
    enjoyed the fruits of regularisation for a considerable
    long period of eight years, it is the demand of natural
    justice to issue show cause notice to the petitioner if
    any of the service conditions of the petitioner is
    hampered or before putting any dent on it. Since
    admittedly the petitioner had served as regular
    employee under the work-charge establishment for a
    considerable long time of eight years, the view of
    this court is that before cancelling the said order an
    opportunity should have been given to the petitioner.
    Since admittedly this has not been done, the view of
    the court is that the same cannot be allowed to
    remain stand and is hereby quashed.                The
    respondents are hereby directed that the petitioner
    would be deemed to have been continued as regular
    employee without any break and also consequential
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                                                   5</span>

    benefits to which he is entitled to shall be granted to
    him.
</p><p id="p_20">    4. Eventually, all the three petitions succeed and are
    hereby allowed.        The impugned order dated
    8.10.2004 is hereby quashed.''

</p><p id="p_21">13. Learned Single Judge has quashed the order dated 8th
October,2004 meaning thereby the order dated 14.05.1996
granting regular pay scale was restored. Thereafter, a writ
appeal was preferred by state of Madhya Pradesh before
the Division Bench of this Court and the Division Bench of
this Court in writ appeal No.128 of 2006 has passed the
following order;-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">     ''Heard on admission.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">        By this appeal, the appellant state has assailed the
       order dated 14.01.2005 passed in W.P.(s)
       No.1512/2004 by which 3 petitions including the
       present petition were decided by the learned Single
       Judge and it was directed that the employee who
       was de-regularised, shall be deemed to have been
       continued as regular employee without any break.
       A similar Writ Appeal No.131/2006 has been
       dismissed by order dated 10.11.2006. Thus, for the
       reasons stated in the said order, this appeal is
       dismissed.''

</blockquote><p id="p_22">14. The aforesaid order reflects that the Division Bench of
this court has affirmed the order passed by learned single
judge, meaning thereby Baliram Baghel was granted
regular pay scale by virtue of order dated 14.05.1996. Not
only this, SLP preferred by the state of Madhya Pradesh
was also dismissed by the Apex Court.
</p>
<p id="p_23">15. In the present case, the petitioner as he was also a
beneficiary of order dated 14.05.1996 submitted a
representation before the        respondents and as nothing
was being done in the mater of grant of regular pay scale
keeping in view the judgment delivered by this court in the
case of Baliram Baghel, the petitioner was left with no other
choice except to approach this Court.             The present
petitioner preferred a writ petition i.e. W.P. No.6012 of 09(s)
and the same was disposed of by this Court by an order
dated 27.08.09. This Court while quashing order dated
08.10.2008 also observed that the petitioner would be
entitled for the benefits accrued to him by virtue of order
dated 14.05.1996 till the fresh decision is taken in the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                                                   6</span>

matter and as the order passed by the learned Single
Judge was not complied with a Contempt petition was also
preferred and the same was disposed of by an order dated
21.12.09 and time was granted to respondents-contemnors
therein to pass appropriate order in the matter. The
respondents-State has thereafter issued a show-cause
notice and finally has passed the impugned order dated
17.12.2008 by which earlier order passed by respondents
dated 14.05.1996 has been withdrawn.
</p>
<p id="p_24">16. This Court has carefully gone through the order
dated 14.05.1996 as well as order dated 17.12.2008 and
the order dated 14.05.1996 reveals that cases of those
employees who have completed 5 years' service in the
contingency establishment were considered for grant of
regular pay scale in the light of circular dated 17.03.1978
and as many as 68 persons were granted regular pay
scale including the petitioner alongwith Shri Baliram
Baghel, petitioner of W.P. No.1512 of 2004. The petitioner
at the relevant point of time was having 5 years' of
experience and he was granted regular pay scale and not
the benefit of regularisation. The learned counsel for the
petitioner confined his prayer in the present writ petition for
grant of regular pay scale as has been granted to Shri
Baliram Baghel by virtue of order dated 14.05.1996 and
has also reserved his right to take appropriate action in
accordance with law for ventilating his grievance in respect
of regularisation.
</p>
<p id="p_25">17. This Court has carefully gone through impugned
order dated 17.12.2008 (annexure P-10) as well as
annexure R-3 issued by General Administration
Department. Annexure R-3 nowhere reflects that the
earlier circular of the State Government dated 17.03.1978
has been withdrawn. The circular of General
Administration Department dated 09.01.1990 imposes a
ban in respect of appointment of contingency paid
employees in a establishment where no sanctioned post is
available. It does not deal with grant of regular pay scale
at all and the fact remains that identically placed persons
have been granted regular pay scale by virtue of various
orders passed by this Court from time to time including
Shri Baliram Baghel, petitioner of writ petitioner No.1512
of 2004.
</p>
<p id="p_26">      18. This Court is of the considered opinion that as the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                                                       7</span>

       name of the petitioner was also included in the order dated
       14.05.1996 along with Baliram Baghel, therefore, he
       cannot be discriminated in the matter of grant of regular
       pay scale as has been granted to Shri Baliram Baghel and
       other identically placed persons and, therefore, once the
       benefit has been extended to identically placed persons
       and they are enjoying the regular pay scale, there appears
       to be no justification in denying the benefit of regular pay
       scale to the present petitioner. Resultantly, the impugned
       order dated 17.12.2008 is hereby quashed."
</p>

<p id="p_27">      Keeping in view the aforesaid submission of counsel for
parties and undisputed position that case of petitioner is identical,
the present case is also disposed off by setting aside the impugned
order dated 17/12/2008 and by holding that the direction issued in
case of Suresh Chandra Hirve (supra) will apply mutatis mutandis in
case of present petitioner also.
</p><p id="p_28">      C.C. As per rules.
