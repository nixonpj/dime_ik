CORAM: HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE KISHORE KUMAR MANDAL
                               CAV JUDGMENT
Date: 26-04-2016
 Patna High Court CWJC No.912 of 2016 dt.26-04-2016

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                         2/17</span>




                             Switch over of political affiliation or loyalty by the

        elected representative(s) of the people on the eve of election or in the

        wake of formation of Governments is a matter of common knowledge

        in our democracy. <a href="/doc/1735861/" id="a_1">Article 191</a> of the Constitution of India, in the case

        of Parliament, and <a href="/doc/390434/" id="a_2">Article 102</a> in the case of State Legislature deal

        with such incidents which cut at the root of political morality. In the

        52nd amendment to the Constitution the grievous challenge facing the

        parliamentary democracy in our country on account of defection by

        the elected Member(s) of the House was addressed and the Tenth

        Schedule       was inserted to the Constitution      to combat the    ever

        growing menace of defection in the political arena in more effective

        and decisive manner.
</p>
<p id="p_15">                             The scope and ambit of the inserted Constitutional

        provision engaged the attention of the          Hon‟ble Apex Court on

        numerous occasions providing it an opportunity to explain the broad

        contours of the power exercised by the Courts in such matter under

        Articles 32 and 226 of the Constitution of India. Before I deal with

        the rival contentions of the parties, it is expedient to adumbrate the

        legal principles enunciated on this aspect by the Apex Court.

                        statement of the material facts on which the
                        petitioner ( khalap) was relying and further that

                        Rule 6 were also not complied with inasmuch as
                        the petitions were not accompanied by copies of
                        the     documentary evidence on which the

<blockquote id="blockquote_5">                        We are unable to accept the said contention of
                        shri Sen. The disqualification Rules have been
                        framed to regulate the procedure that is to be
                        followed by the Speaker for exercising the
                        power conferred on him under sub-paragraph
                        (1) of paragraph 6 of the Tenth Schedule to the
                        Constitution. The Disqualification Rules are,
                        therefore, procedural in nature and any violation
                        of the same would amount to an irregularity in

                        constitutional mandates, mala fides, non
                        compliance with Rules of Natural Justice and
                        perversity. We are unable to uphold the
                        contention of Shre Sen that the violation of the
                        Disqualification Rules amounts to violation of
                        constitutional mandates. By doing so we would
                        be elevating the rules to the status of the
                        provisions of the Constitution which is
                        impermissible. Since the Disqualification Rules
                        have been framed by the Speaker in exercise of
                        the power conferred under paragraph 8 of the
                        Tenth Schedule they have a status subordinate
                        to the Constitution and cannot be equated with
                        the provisions of the Constitution. They cannot,
                        therefore, be regarded as constitutional a
                        mandates and any violation of the
                        Disqualification Rules does not afford a ground
                        for judicial review of the order of the Speaker in
                        view of the finality clause contained in sub-
                        paragraph (1) of paragraph 6 of the Tenth

        disqualified to hold the elected position of Member of Bihar

        Legislative Council. Both parties have made submissions with

        reference to the pleadings in the said case. It is noted that while the

        matter was pending enquiry before the respondent-Chairman CWJC

        No. 335 of 2016 was filed by the petitioner to challenge the order

        dated 23.12.2015 passed by the said respondent                 rejecting the

        Council from the Bihar Legislative Assembly Constituency in 2012.

        House under the Tenth Schedule of the Constitution on the ground

        that the action and conduct of the writ petitioner from May, 2014

        would demonstrably prove that he, by his conduct, had voluntarily

        given      up      the Membership of the party and thereby earned

        disqualification under paragraph 2 (1)(a) of the Tenth Schedule. The

        complaint made in this regard is Annexure-1. It was alleged, inter alia,

        that the petitioner along with others had formed a different political

        party in the name of Hindustan Aawam Morcha (HAM) and got it

        registered with the Election Commission of India inasmuch as the

        petitioner      engaged        himself profusely   in   participating in the

        meeting/rallies of HAM and delivered several public speeches. It

        would be germane to notice here that the entire nation was then

        engaged in        electing Members to the 16th Lok Sabha for which

        elections were announced and political equations were changing. A

        notice was issued           and served on the petitioner, on 3.11.2015

        whereafter he appeared and participated in the enquiry. The hearing of

        the case was made by the respondent- Chairman on 19.11.2015,

        24.11.2015, 5.12.2015,14.12.2015, 23.12.2015, 04.01.2016 and

        06.01.2016 when the order was passed disqualifying him from the

        Membership of the Bihar Legislative Council . In the reasoned order

        passed by the respondent-Chairman, it was held/observed as under:-

<p id="p_25">                             In assailing the order, the counsel for the petitioner

        has submitted that the rudimentary principle of natural justice has

        been     violated.      The     respondent       Chairman       considered      those

        material/evidence to record its satisfaction, which were not part of the

        complaint (Annexure-1) filed by the respondent no.4. No doubt, in

        view of the settled legal principles invocation of the jurisdiction of the

        Chairman under the relevant provisions is not dependent upon filing

        of a complaint by any one aggrieved yet if the respondent-Chairman

        chose to exercise its power/jurisdiction on a written complaint then

        conferred in para 8 of Tenth Schedule (Annexure-2) ought to have

        been generally adhered to. He drew diverse deficiencies in the

        pleadings of the complainant. It was the malafide                  act of the

        respondent       Chairman          in propelling   him to come to the said

        conclusion relying on extraneous materials and to hold that by his

        obvious      conduct the petitioner          had   voluntarily   given up the

        Membership of the party (J.D.(U)). In doing so, the principles of Audi

        Alteram Partem which is inherent in our adjudicatory system has

        been grossly          breached. The conduct of the petitioner which

        disentitled him to continue as Member of the House ought to have

        been demonstrated and substantiated by oral/documentary evidence.

        The petitioner was not afforded                    an opportunity to lead

        oral/documentary evidence. Conceding the wide jurisdiction in such

        matter conferred on the Speaker/Chairman who holds the high

        Constitutional post, it has been urged that in matter like this where a

        Member has to              lose       his Membership having grave        civil

        consequences the personal satisfaction of the Chairman is not the

        requirement of law. There must be reliable evidence/materials to

        come to an objective satisfaction that the writ petitioner indulged

        in such political activities or conducts              which proved that he

        voluntarily gave up the Membership of the party to which he

        belonged. Considering the serious flaws in the pleading of the

        respondent no.4, the respondent-Chairman ought to have rejected the

        complaint and/or called upon the complainant-respondent no.4 to

        remove those defects. Further, as no reply to the written show cause/

        written submission of the petitioner was filed by the complainant-

        respondent no.4, the explanation or the stand taken by the writ

        petitioner ought to have been accepted. The respondent-Chairman

        erred in considering the communications received by it from the

        Election Commission of India disclosing that on being sponsored by

        HAM the petitioner was included as one of the star campaigners of

        that political party ( HAM).

        copy whereof is enclosed at Annexure-2. As noted above, the Apex

        Court having considered the fasciculus of the aforesaid provision(s)

        in Ravi S. Naik ( supra) while affirming the view expressed in

        Kihoto Hollohan (supra) negated the submission of the appellant

        about non-compliance of the Rules framed by the Speaker/Chairman

        as would appear from a reading of paragraph Nos. 18 and 19 of the

        report. The       Apex Court also did not find any substance    in the

        contention of the appellant ( ref. para 26 of the report) that the

        appellant was denied the opportunity to adduce the evidence. In

        Mahachandra Prasad Singh (supra) the disqualification ordered

        against the appellant was challenged on the ground of non adherence

        to the Rules framed under paragraph 8 of the Tenth Schedule. The

        Apex Court negated the contention and held that the Rules so framed

        were      directory in nature. The jurisdiction of the respondent -

        Chairman flows from the provisions contained in Tenth Schedule of

        the Constitution. It may be noted that        contention of both the

        respondents is that the case at hand is fully covered by the decisions

        of the Apex Court reported in Kihoto Hollohan and Ravi S.Naik

        (supra) which got approval in the case of Dr. Mahachandra Singh

        (supra). On the other hand, it has been argued with all wisdom at his

        command by Mr. Kanth that the present case is different in the texture

        as a written objection was filed pointing out the gross deficiencies in
 Patna High Court CWJC No.912 of 2016 dt.26-04-2016

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                                        14/17</span>




        the complaint filed by             the respondent no.4, and as such, the

        respondent -Chairman ought to have considered the objection and

        rejected the complaint. Although the argument appears attractive but

        on deeper scrutiny it is found contrary to what has been held in the

        cases on which the respondents have relied.                 Filing of written

        complaint, in my view, shall make no material difference in the case.

        The Apex Court has held the dispute of such nature is not adversarial

        litigation. The respondent- Speaker could have taken cognizance of

        the existing state of affairs suo motu or on a petition filed in this

        regard. In both cases, the respondent- Chairman is required to make

        an enquiry to satisfy himself about the existing state of affairs

        indicating voluntarily giving up the Membership of the party by a

        Member of the House and                 to give adequate   opportunity to the

        Member. Incidentally, it may be noted that apart from the materials

        placed by the complainant               the respondent Chairman in order to

        satisfy himself got a confirmation letter from the Election

        Commission of India (for short                „the ECI‟) disclosing that the

        petitioner was declared by the ECI as one of the star campaigners of

        the newly founded political party called HAM. On a request made by

        the petitioner copies of the communication of ECI received in the

        Secretariat of the respondent- Chairman and other materials were

        made over to the petitioner whereafter he                  filed   his written

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">                                        15/17</span>




        submission/written         statement         which   was   considered   by   the

        respondent- Chairman and the final order was passed. Any such order

        passed by the respondent- Chairman, even according to the writ

        petitioner, can be challenged on the ground of non compliance of

        the principles of Audi Alteram Partem which is                  fundamental to

        adjudicatory system or on the ground of mala fide or being perverse.

        On bare perusal of the records, including the order impugned there

        is no doubt in the mind of the Court that adequate opportunity of

        making submission            or being heard in the face of incriminating

        materials/ circumstances was afforded to the petitioner . The hearing

        of the matter was made on diverse dates . The petitioner instead of

        utilizing those hearings in the enquiry                raised merely technical

        objection(s). Even in the written statement/ written argument he stuck

        to     raising         technical        objection and not placing relevant

        circumstances which may demonstrate that he had not given up the

        Membership of the party which sponsored him and got a birth in the

        House. The Court would clarify that in the light of the judgments of

        the Apex Court the enquiry made under the Tenth Schedule, cannot

        be equated with the proceedings of the election dispute or the suit. It

        is because any or every political action or conduct of the Member of

        the House is in the gauge of the people at large whom he claims to

        represent. The Chairman holds a revered constitutional post and is

        expected to take a decision on the existing state of affairs promptly as

        delay in such matter would                    defeat the very purpose of the

        constitutional provision. The Court is also not              convinced by the

        submission of Mr. Kanth that the proceeding suffers from mala fide.

        There is no convincing material to hold so. Moreover, any such

        allegation would not sustain as the respondent- Chairman, the author

        of the order, is not party to the proceeding. The petitioner has rightly

        not chosen to do so considering the high constitutional post held by

        him and the pious duty cast on him to act in completely non-partisan

        manner. The impugned order cannot be held                     as   perverse as

        indisputably the jurisdiction to exercise the power is conferred on the

        respondent and it is not a case of absolutely no material on record to

        record the satisfaction. The petitioner has rightly not founded his

        challenge on the ground that the impugned order is perverse. It has

        fairly been conceded by Mr. Kanth that even in absence of a written

        complaint by the respondent no.4, the respondent - Chairman was

        authorized in law to ignite                  the enquiry and pass order. Much

        insistence has been placed by the petitioner that the satisfaction of

        the respondent-Chairman to recognize and declare an existing state of

        affairs with respect to the Member of the House has to be objective.

        The term objective satisfaction means presence of relevant material

        inspiring confidence. It may also be a case of perception but one

                 should not forget the perception mirrors the conduct of the person.

                 In the present case it was the political conduct of a well known

                 political figure . Who can be the best Judge to appreciate the political

                 conduct of the Member other than the Chairman of the House who

                 conducts the proceedings of the House and take ancillary decision(s)

                 thereto.

                 considering the consistent view of the Apex Court on the issue, as

                 noticed above, I am unable to find any substance in the submission(s)

                 of the counsel for the petitioner in assailing the impugned order and

                 find any merit in the writ application. Dismissed.
