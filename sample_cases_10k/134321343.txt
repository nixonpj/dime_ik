</pre><p id="p_1"> condonation of delay, which has occurred in filing the cross-

 objections by the respective original claimants in respective

 appeals. The appeals are filed either by the acquiring body

 or by the State Government against the judgments and

 Awards passed in Land Acquisition References (LARs). The

 period of delay varies in every application.                           In some

 applications when the delay is of a shorter period, delay

 caused in some of the matters is of a huge period. In every

 application attempt has been made to justify the said delay

 and variety of reasons are assigned.

                  of the Limitation Act deals with the extension

                  within the meaning of <a href="/doc/100581/" id="a_5">Section 5</a> of the

<p id="p_8"> 4.               In the aforesaid matter, First Appeal which was

 filed in the year 2002 was listed on Board for final hearing,

 for the first time, in June 2011. Thereafter cross-objection

 was filed. The reason, as was assigned in justification of the

 delay caused in preferring the application was that, the

 respondent had instructed his Advocate to file the cross-

 objection, however, he was informed that the court fees is

 required to be paid and for various reasons the court fees

 could not be arranged by the said respondent.



</p><p id="p_9"> 5.               In the matters which are before this Court for

 consideration,            similar   reasons   are   assigned           by     the

 respective respondents-claimants in justification of the

 delay caused in filing the cross-objections by them.                            As

 observed by this Court in the cited judgment, sub-rule (1) of




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">::: Uploaded on - 04/03/2019                    ::: Downloaded on - 22/03/2019 13:45:20 :::</span>

 Rule 22 of Order 41 of the Code does not incorporate the

 stringent requirement of establishing a sufficient cause.

 This Court has further observed in the cited judgment that a

 wide power to extend time to file cross-objection has been

 vested in the Appellate court. It has also observed that the

 power to extend the time under sub-rule (1) of Rule 22 of

 Order 41 of the Code has to be liberally exercised in a case

 where cross-objection is sought to be filed before the appeal

 is listed for final hearing. Having regard to the view taken

 by this Court in the case cited supra, though I am inclined to

 condone the delay, while exercising such discretion in

 favour of the respondents-claimants, it appears to me that

 since the respondents-claimants did not file the cross-

 objection within the period as stipulated in sub-rule (1) of

 Rule 22 of Order 41 of the Code, it would not be unjust and

 improper if they are disentitled of the interest for the period

 of delay in the event their cross-objections are allowed and

 consequently the amount of compensation is enhanced on

 the said enhanced amount of compensation.
