declared hostile). However, after the occurrence Mukesh immediately went

to his parental house at a small distance from where his brother Rakesh

shifted him to the civil hospital, Sirsa where Dr. G.S. Somani sent ruqa

Ex.PB to the police station, upon which ASI Roshan Lal reached the

residence of Ms. Ritu Bahl, JMIC, Sirsa (PW-14) and moved an application

Ex. PM before the Magistrate for recording the statement of Mukesh.

Thereafter, he moved another application Ex. PE before the doctor for

seeking his opinion about the condition of the injured, over which the

            Ans. I had previous enmity with Manohar Journalist. I had

            gone to my in-laws house at Bhiwani. I had gone there on

            Saturday falling prior to 1st July. It was perhaps 29th. My

           Ganga Ram and their father Manohar journalist. I do not know

           what happened. I had returned on 9th July. My brothers etc. did

           not compromise the matter. My brothers had got bail, therefore,

           they were inimical. Today at 1/1.15 p.m. my wife was cleaning

           the utensils and I was watching the movie.        My landlord

           Subhash and his family members were also not present.       He

           had gone to Fatehabad with one of his sons from vend of

           Cinema and his second son Amar Nath was also away. His

           wife was also out of station. My room was having access

           through two gates. Mohinder and Toni had come through one

           of the gates and after pouring kerosene on me, set me ablaze

           and ran away. I raised hue and cry and wore a blanket. My

           wife    poured water to put off the fire. I went to my parents,

           who were residing at a small distance. I was separate and

           living on rent. My brother Rakesh and his friend then shifted

           me in rickshaw to the hospital. Other family members reached

           later there.

           quarreled with any one and I was afraid of it.

period his statement was recorded by Ms. Ritu Bahl, JMIC, Sirsa.

the deceased), PW8 Sushil and PW10 Rakesh, brother of deceased, did not

support the prosecution case. Therefore, they were declared hostile.

Constable Bajrang Lal are the formal witnesses. PW9 Rajesh is the witness

to the memo Ex. PK, vide which the police had taken into possession all the

<a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_6">Section 313</a> Cr.P.C. the accused denied all the incriminating circumstances

appearing against them and pleaded their false implication in the case.

</p><p id="p_11">            However, they further pleaded that they are innocent.          The

deceased was tutored by the inimical persons and he made false statement to

implicate them in the case. In defence, the accused examined Inderaj DW.1,

who stated that on 21.7.2000 at 1 p.m. on hearing the cries of the wife of

Mukesh @ Bhola he entered their house and saw two ladies pouring water

on him, who had caught fire, while working on a stove. He also came to

know later on that the deceased had named Mohinder and Surinder being

the perpetrators of the crime.
</p>
<p id="p_12">             Arguments heard. Record perused.
</p>
<p id="p_13">             No doubt, PW5 Meenu, wife of Mukesh @ Bhola, PW7 Shanti,

mother of the deceased, PW8 Sushil and Rakesh (PW10), (brother of

deceased), did not come forward to depose against the accused, may be for

variety of reasons. Obviously when the life was lost they had lost the love

and affection but still the glaring facts surfacing on the record directly point

finger of guilt towards the accused. There is no denying the fact that the

incident took place in the presence of Shanti and Meenu but they had their

own reasons not to support the prosecution case. Though the Investigating

Officer did not lift the burn articles i.e. ashes and the burnt strings of the

cot from the spot, yet, since the case is based on the dying declaration

corroborated by other evidence and the occurrence at the one room tenement

has not been disputed, therefore, these circumstances cannot be overlooked.

</p><p id="p_14">             DW1 Inderraj has stated that on hearing the cries, he entered

the house of Mukesh and saw Meenu and Shanti pouring water on Mukesh

as he had already attracted the fire. DW1 has also admitted that occurrence

had taken place at 1 p.m, as set up by the prosecution. It has also been

proved on record that the injured was shifted to the hospital by Rakesh. This

fact was also corroborated by PW1 Dr. G.S. Somani, who has also stated

that the injured was brought to the hospital by Rakesh, his brother. It is

apparently proved on record from the evidence that Mukesh died due to

burn injuries.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_6"> Crl. Appeal No. 347 DB of 2002                                      7</span><p id="p_15">

</p><p id="p_16">                                    ***

            PW2 Dr. Y.K. Chaudhary has categorically stated that Mukesh

had died due to shock as a result of burns described and its complications,

which were ante-mortem and sufficient to cause death in the ordinary course

of nature. The clothes of the injured were taken into possession by the

police and were sent to Forensic Science Laboratory, Madhuban, Haryana

for examination. Dr. V. Singh, vide his report Ex. PM opined that kerosene

residue were detected on partially burnt grey coloured T-shirt and partially

burnt light grey coloured pant, belonging to the deceased.

</p><p id="p_17">            Now coming to the part played by the accused, we have

sufficient evidence in the shape of dying declaration as proved by Ms. Ritu

Bahl, JMIC, that it was the accused who set the deceased ablaze. Before

Ms. Ritu Bahl recorded her statement, ASI Roshan Lal, vide his application

Ex. PE had sought the opinion of the doctor, who, vide his opinion Ex. PE/1

opined that at 4.45 p.m the injured was fit to make the statement. Ms. Ritu

Bahl, JMIC, Sirsa, (PW-14) testified that she asked some general questions

to Rakesh Kumar @ Bhola and satisfied herself about his fitness to make

the statement. Thereafter, she asked him questions and he answered and

whatever was stated by him was recorded. There is no evidence of tutoring

or prompting the deceased before his statement was recorded. As a matter

of fact, the dying declaration made before Ms. Ritu Bahl, JMIC by the

deceased is not under challenge.
</p>
<p id="p_18">            The version of the accused that Mukesh has levelled false

allegations on account of tutoring, does not stand substantiated by any

evidence on record. Though, no enmity of the deceased or his brother with

the accused could be brought on record, yet, it is hardly circumstance to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7"> Crl. Appeal No. 347 DB of 2002                                          8</span>

                                       ***

doubt the dying declaration as it is a unique type of case where even the

mother, wife and brother of the deceased joined hands with the accused, but

the accused have failed to shatter the unblemished evidence of dying

declaration by the deceased. Even after recording the statement of the

deceased on 21.7.2000, Dr. C.P. Daditch, vide his endorsement Ex. PF/1,

testified that the patient remained fit during the period he made the

statement i.e. between 4.45 p.m. to 5.05 p.m.          No such suggestion or

evidence was brought on record in order to establish that the injured was

ever fainted or was not fit to make the statement. No allegations of bias

were raised against the Investigating Officer for manipulating the dying

declaration nor challenge has been made to the credibility of Ms. Ritu Bahl,

who recorded the statement of the deceased. The deceased having suffered

burns and he hoping least chance of his survival and as asked by the

Investigating Officer to disclose the cause of death, Mukesh made the

statement.     Ultimately, his that statement was rightly treated as dying

declaration.
</p>
<p id="p_19">               As a matter of fact, juristic theory regarding acceptability of a

dying declaration is that such declaration is made in extremity, as it is

believed that the person who is at the verge of death and having lost his

every hope of survival in the world would not tell lie and falsehood would

not come to his tongue to accuse him in the next world.              Therefore,

emphasis has been given to believe his testimony provided the same is free

from any such tampering by way of prompting, tutoring since he would be

no more in the world for cross-examination.          Therefore, the law in its

wisdom made such statement admissible in evidence by dispensing the

statement from cross-examination.
</p>
<p id="p_20">             While discussing the aforesaid aspect of the case and theme

behind placing reliance over the dying declaration, the Apex Court in

<a href="/doc/1305772/" id="a_7">Laxman v. State of Maharashtra</a>, 2002 (4) RCR (Criminal) 149 observed

as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">             "The juristic theory     regarding acceptability of a dying

             declaration is that such declaration is made in extremity, when

             the party is at the point of death and when every hope of this

             world is gone, when every motive to falsehood is silenced, and

             the man is induced by the most powerful consideration to speak

             only the truth. Notwithstanding the same, great caution must

             be exercised in considering the weight to be given to this

             species of evidence on account of the existence of many

             circumstances which may affect their truth. The    situation   in

             which a man is on death bed is so solemn and serene, is the

             reason in law to accept the veracity of his statement. It is for

             this reason the requirements of oath and cross-examination are

             dispensed with.   Since the accused has no power of cross-

             examination, the court insist that the dying declaration should

             be of such a nature as to inspire full confidence of the court in

             its truthfulness and correctness. The court, however has to

             always be on guard to see that the statement of the deceased

             was not as a result of either tutoring or prompting or a product

             of imagination. The court also must further decide that the

             deceased was in a fit state of mind and had the opportunity to

                                   ***

           observe and identify the assailant. Normally, therefore, the

           court in order to satisfy whether the deceased was in a fit

           mental condition to make the dying declaration look up to the

           medical opinion. But where the eyewitnesses state that the

           deceased was in a fit and conscious state to make the

           declaration, the medical opinion will not prevail, nor can it be

           said that since there is no certification of the doctor as to the

           fitness of the mind of the declarant, the dying declaration is not

           acceptable. A dying declaration can be oral or in writing and in

           any adequate method of communication whether by words or

           by signs or otherwise will suffice provided the indication is

           positive and definite. In most cases, however, such statements

           are made orally before death ensues and is reduced to writing

           by someone like a magistrate or a doctor or a police officer.

           When it is recorded, no oath is necessary nor is the presence of

           a magistrate is absolutely necessary, although to assure

           authenticity it is usual to call a magistrate, if available for

           recording the statement of a man about to die. There is no

           requirement of law that a dying declaration must necessarily be

           made to a magistrate and when such statement is recorded by a

           magistrate there is no specified statutory form for such

           recording. Consequently, what evidential value or weight has

           to be attached to such statement necessarily depends on the

           facts and circumstances of each particular case.         What is

           essentially required is that the person who records a dying

                                     ***

            declaration must be satisfied that the deceased was in a fit state

            of mind. Where it is proved by the testimony of the magistrate

            that the declarant was fit to make the statement even without

            examination by the doctor the declaration can be acted upon

            provided the court ultimately holds the same to be voluntary

            and truthful. A certification by the doctor is essentially a rule

            of caution and therefore the voluntary and truthful nature of the

            declaration can be established otherwise."</blockquote><p id="p_21">

</p><p id="p_22">            The mere fact that the deceased had died after six days does not

in any way enable us to hold that the statement was not recorded when the

injured was on the verge of his death and it cannot be termed as dying

declaration. Actually there is no evidence on record that the deceased at any

stage of time, during his ailment and admission in the hospital, had any

occasion to make a different improved or contradictory statement or make

such statement implicating some other person than the accused. At the time,

statement was recorded, Roshan Lal was not the Investigating Officer. He

was not in any way connected with either of the parties. He was heading

towards searching the cause of injuries, therefore, there is reason to

disbelieve him and state that the statement recorded by him was tainted.

The argument that the Investigating Officer did not lift the burnt bed sheet,

strings of cot is also of no consequence.

<p id="p_23">            We are oblivious to the fact that the Investigating Officer

should have picked up such pieces of evidence yet in view of the fact that

the defence witness has not denied that the deceased had caught fire inside

the house, the possibility of deceased having started running on attracting

                                     ***

fire in order to save himself cannot be ruled out. In any way, this much fact

is not sufficient to discard the dying declaration made by the accused

immediately after the occurrence.

<p id="p_24">             No other arguments has been advanced.

<p id="p_25">             Keeping in view the fact that dying declaration made by

Mukesh @ Bhola stands corroborated by the medical evidence as well as by

the other evidence on record and the deceased also had no reason to

implicate the accused falsely in the case, we hesitate to differ with the

finding of guilt recorded by the trial court against the accused/appellants.
