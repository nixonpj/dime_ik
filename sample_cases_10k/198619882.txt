M.M. KUMAR, J.
</pre>
<p id="p_1">1.          This order shall dispose of two petitions, namely, CWP

Nos. 17201 and 17234 of 2010 filed under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1">Article 226</a> of the

Constitution of India.   The prayer made by the petitioners is for
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1"> CWP No. 17201 of 2010                                           -2-</span>

quashing the communication dated 14.09.2010 (P-17) rejecting the

consent applications of the petitioners to opt for Land Pooling

Scheme of the State of Punjab being illegal, arbitrary and violative of

the principles of natural justice.   A further prayer has also been

made for quashing the Public Notice published on 08.03.2010 (P-8),

award dated 16.04.2010 (P-11) and corrigendum published on

26.04.2010 (P-13) to the extent that it provides only 121 Sq. Yards

of commercial land against each acre of the acquired land by

including parking area in the same. The attack on the aforesaid

public notice, award and corrigendum is primarily based on

allegation that it violates the Land Pooling Scheme dated 05.09.2008

(P-3), issued by respondent-State of Punjab and it violates master

plan of SAS Nagar (Mohali) notified on 12.12.2008 and the

development/ layout plan dated 12.11.2009 (P-9).       Still further, a

prayer for quashing the development /layout plan dated 01.04.2010

(P-10) to the extent that it did not depict the developed commercial

land and instead show many pockets as reserved area, which term

has been coined with malafide intention to deceive and cheat the

land owners including the petitioners who had opted for Land

Pooling Scheme, which violates the master plan dated 12.12.2008.

Other consequential prayer has also been made.
</p>
<p id="p_2">2.         When the matter came up for consideration before this

Court on 23.09.2010, learned counsel for the petitioners categorically

stated that the petitioner did not have any objection to the proposed
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2"> CWP No. 17201 of 2010                                            -3-</span>

acquisition and his grievance was only regarding non-implementation

of the Land Pooling Scheme in a proper manner and that too has

been limited to commercial sites.     It is claimed that no area for

parking could be deducted from the developed commercial area.

The other grievance made was that before offering plots to the

general public, it is incumbent upon the authorities to offer

residential/ commercial plots by way of compensation for the land

acquired.   On 24.09.2010, after issuance of notice of motion, the

parties were heard with regard to draw of lots to allot residential

plots to the general public in the proposed scheme, which was to

commence on 25.09.2010.          On behalf of Greater Mohali Area

Development Authority (for brevity 'GMADA'), it was stated before

this Court that the applications of petitioners     No. 6, 7, 8 and 11

(CWP No. 17201 of 2010) have already been accepted under the

Land Pooling Scheme.      The applications of other petitioners were

stated to be under active consideration.     Learned counsel for the

GMADA made the following statement before the Bench, which reads

as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">                      "Mr. Brar states that draw of lots will only be

                 held for the purpose of determining eligibility of the

                 applicants to get a plot allotted. Before issuance of

                 letter of intent and the number of plots/ allotment

                 letter to the allottees, eligibility of the land owners

                 to get plots shall be decided after inviting options
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3"> CWP No. 17201 of 2010                                               -4-</span>

                   regarding size of the plot and letter of intent shall

                   also be issued to them on the same day along with

                   the applicants, who may be successful in the draw

                   of lots.    In view of statement made, we direct

                   respondent No.2 to conduct draw of lots. However,

                   it is made clear that the result of the draw of lots

                   shall be subject to the ultimate outcome of the writ

                   petition.   It is further made clear that commercial

                   plots shall be put to auction only after getting

                   appropriate orders from this Court."

</blockquote><p id="p_3">3.            It is, thus, evident that the draw of lots for the purpose

of determining eligibility of the applicants to get a plot allotted was

permitted to be held on 25.09.2011 as scheduled.          The eligibility of

the land owners for allotment of plots was to be decided after

inviting options regarding size of the plot. The letter of intent was to

be issued to them on the same date along                  with successful

applicants.     The commercial plots were to be put to auction only

after getting appropriate orders from this Court.

</p><p id="p_4">4.            In response to the notice of motion, short replies by way

of affidavit of respondents were filed on 06.12.2010 and 23.05.2011.

Thereafter a detailed written statement on behalf of respondent No.2

was filed on 23.09.2011.        The stand taken by respondent No.2 is

that the Land Pooling Scheme gives discretion to the acquiring

department to vary the norms keeping in view the passage of time
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4"> CWP No. 17201 of 2010                                          -5-</span>

and geographical situation of the land. It has been explained that

out of one acre of land, 1936 sq. yards land is being developed for

residential purposes and 242 sq. yards land for commercial purposes.

The total developed area of land for residential and commercial

purposes would come to 2178 sq. yards. The Land Pooling Scheme

(P-3) in categorical terms clarify that half of the commercial

developed area out of the total commercial developed area per acre

is to be allotted to the land owners who opt for the Land Pooling

Scheme.    The commercial developed area of 242 sq. yards per acre

is to be shared equally by GMADA with the land owners who opt for

Land Pooling Scheme.    Thus, both of them would be entitled to 121

sq. yards, which included parking.   It is claimed that there was no

question of any discrimination caused to the petitioners. Out of one

acre of land, two commercial sites measuring 121 sq. yards each,

which includes parking is being developed and the area offered in

commercial sites is the same.
</p>
<p id="p_5">5.         Written statement further clarified that in the award also,

the aforesaid position has been made clear that 121 sq. yards of

commercial area would include parking area.        It has also been

further clarified that GMADA-respondent No.2 was not to take away

more area than 121 sq. yards which include the parking with 60.5

sq. yards permitted for construction with 1.75 floor area ratio. There

is no violation of the Land Pooling Scheme either by public notice on

08.03.2010 or the corrigendum published on 26.04.2010 because the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5"> CWP No. 17201 of 2010                                            -6-</span>

public notice dated 08.03.2010 (P-8) indicated that the commercial

site of 121 sq. yards include the parking area.     The aforesaid facts

have also been clarified in paragraph Nos. 4 and 5 of the written

statement on merit.
</p>
<p id="p_6">6.         Mr. A.K. Chopra, learned Senior counsel has stated that

the only issue which survives for consideration is whether the

commercial area of 242 sq. yards per acre to be developed by

GMADA would include the parking area. In other words, the only

issue which survives for consideration of this Court is that petitioners

who were to be allotted 121 sq. yards of commercial area against

one acre of land contributed to the Land Pooling Scheme would be

under obligation to contribute the area for parking or not.

According to Mr. Chopra, the area for parking has not been shown in

the site plan and respondent No.2-GMADA is acting unfairly by

setting off the area for parking, out of the total area 121 sq. yards.

In that regard, he has placed reliance on the communication dated

05.09.2008 (P-3 Colly.) with the subject 'Implementation of Land

Pooling Scheme for Land Acquisition in the State of Punjab'.

According to learned Senior counsel, there was no mention of

parking in the Land Pooling Scheme which was decided by Council of

Ministers in the meeting held on 21.08.2008.        Particular emphasis

has been laid on the following clauses, which read as under:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">                 "a)   The compensation proposed to be offered for

                 every acre of land is as under:-

                      ii)     Half of the developed commercial area.

                      b)      The         acquiring     Department        may,

                norms       with    the     passage    of   time    and     the

                topographical position of the land to be acquired.

                For awarding the compensation either the normal

                provisions of the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_2">Land Acquisition Act</a> would apply

                or the package as given have to be accepted as in

                one     acquisition       scheme      different    modes     of

                compensation would be feasible.

                possible to Industry's Department prospectively."

</blockquote><p id="p_7">7.         Reliance has also been placed on the document titled as

Rough Cost Benefit Analysis (P-3 Colly.) to argue that no mention of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7"> CWP No. 17201 of 2010                                          -8-</span>

setting off parking area has been made.
</p>
<p id="p_8">8.         On behalf of the respondents, submissions have been

made by Mr. Suvir Sehgal, learned Addl. A.G., Punjab and Mr. D.V.

Sharma, learned Senior counsel. According to learned counsel, when

the public notice (P-8) was issued, it was clearly mentioned in Clause

1 of the public notice that for measuring one acre, 968 sq. yards

residential and 121 sq. yards would be allotted under the Land

Pooling Scheme, which would include parking area. They have

further submitted that the petitioners are estopped from challenging

the public notice because they applied for the Land Pooling Scheme

after acquiring knowledge that the parking area has to be left out

from the developed commercial area, which was further clarified by

corrigendum dated 26.04.2010 (P-13).        They have also placed

reliance on the award 16.04.2010 (P-11), wherein it was specifically

mentioned that the commercial area 121 sq. yards would be inclusive

of parking area. According to learned counsel, there is no doubt left

that the parking area is not to be provided by GMADA-respondent

No.2, in addition to 121 sq. yards area.
</p>
<p id="p_9">9.         After hearing learned counsel for the parties and perusing

the Land Pooling Scheme as approved by respondent-State on

21.08.2008 (P-3), we are of the considered view that the issue with

regard to parking area is no longer a matter of controversy. It has

been clearly mentioned that for every acre of land, half of the

residential area and half of the commercial area would be offered.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8"> CWP No. 17201 of 2010                                         -9-</span>

The total developed area comes to 1936 sq. yards per acer. Out of

one acer of the land, 1936 sq. yards land is being developed for

residential purposes and 242 sq. yards land for commercial purposes.

The total developed area in respect of both works out to 2178 sq.

yards per acer and 50% of the same is to be allotted to be land

owners who opt for Land Pooling Scheme.            Out of the total

commercial developed area of 242 sq. yards per acer, respondent

No.2-GMADA and the land owners opting for Land Pooling Scheme

are to share the same in equal proportion i.e. 121 sq. yards which

include the parking. The aforesaid facts have been made clear in the

public notice dated 08.03.2010 (P-8), Award dated 16.04.2010 (P-

</p><p id="p_10">11) and corrigendum dated 26.04.2010 (P-13). The public notice,

award and corrigendum cannot be held contrary to Land Pooling

Scheme (P-3) because these documents are complimentary to the

original scheme. It was on the basis of the corrigendum that the

date for inviting applications under the Land Pooling Scheme was

extended to 03.05.2010. Respondent No.2-GMADA has taken a fair

stand that for parking, the land has to be contributed by the land

owners and facilities are also to be used by them or the visitors to

the commercial sites.   Even otherwise, we feel that without parking,

there is no possibility of developing the area and the absence of the

parking may result in complete chaos. We find no illegality,

unreasonableness or discrimination insofar as the area of parking is

to be contributed by the petitioners who have opted for the Land
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9"> CWP No. 17201 of 2010                                             -10-</span>

Pooling Scheme is concerned.       Respondent No.2-GMADA has also

fairly offered to the petitioners that if the terms and conditions of the

scheme are not acceptable to them then they could opt out of the

scheme. Therefore, the claim that the area of parking should be in

addition to 121 sq. yards of commercial land is hereby rejected.

</p><p id="p_11">10.        Accordingly, both the writ petitions do not merit
