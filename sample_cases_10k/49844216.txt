</p><p id="p_2">          Learned counsel for the petitioners invites our attention





    to the decision, rendered by a Coordinate Bench of this Court





    in CWP No. 9519 of 2014, titled as Rakesh Kumar Vs.

    State of H.P. &amp; others, decided on 5.1.2015, which reads





    as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">          "It is contended that the writ petitioners are working as
          Laboratory Attendants in Education Department, were

          placed in the pay scale of ` 5910-20200 plus Grade Pay

          as Rs. 1900/- in terms of the pay revision w.e.f. 1st
          January, 2006,         alongwith other similarly situated
          employees.       But in the year 2012, pay scales were



          revised, which were granted to the other similarly
          situated employees, who were granted the similar pay




          scale in the year 2006, was not granted to the writ





          petitioners w.e.f. 1st October, 2012, i.e. ` 10300-34800 +
          ` 3200 as Grade Pay after two years. Further contended
          that the action of the respondents is discriminatory and





          at the cost of the writ petitioners, who will stagnate till
          their retirement in the said grade. The writ petitioners
          have made representations, but without any fruitful
          results, the respondents have turned deaf ears and
          failed to redress the grievances of the writ petitioners.
          Hence, the writ petition.
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_2">         2.    In CWP No. 9519 of 2014, the writ petitioners have
         given the details how they stand discriminated and how
         the action of the respondents is bad and illegal.

         Advocate General, waives notice on behalf of the





         respondents-State.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">         4.    Respondents-State have filed replies in some of
         the writ petitions and some of the writ petitions came to





         be admitted.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_6">         5.    After noticing that the facts and question of law
         involved in all the writ petitions are similar, Registry

         was directed to list all the cases before the Court today.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_7">         6.    With the consent of the learned counsel for the
         parties, we deem it proper to dispose of all these writ
         petitions with a command to the respondents to



         examine the cases of the writ petitioners in light of the
         averments contained in the writ petitions and make a




         decision within six weeks from the date of receipt of the





         copy of this judgment.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_8">         7.    It goes without saying that in case decision is
         made against the writ petitioners, they are at liberty to





         challenge the same.

         hereinabove, alongwith all pending applications."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_3">    2.   Learned counsel further submits that petitioners shall

    be content if present petitions are disposed of in the aforesaid

    terms, as petitioners are similarly situated.
