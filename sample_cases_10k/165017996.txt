AWARD (ORAL)
       The present industrial dispute between the parties was referred by
Secretary (Labour) ,Government of NCT of Delhi in exercise of powers
conferred by section 10(1)(c) and 12 (5) of the <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_1">Industrial Disputes Act</a>,
1947 (hereinafter referred as 'Act'), r/w Govt. of India, Ministry of Labour
Notification No. S-11011/2/75/DK (1A), dated the 14th April, 1975, to

LIR No. 36/11                                    Page 1 of 6
 the Labour Court No. XIII for adjudication with the following terms of
reference:
                "Whether services of Sh. Sudhir Yadav S/o
                Sh. Jagdish Yadav have been illegally and/or
                unjustifiably terminated by the management;
                and if yes, to what relief is he entitled?"
2.              On service of notice of reference the workman     filed
statement of claim with the prayer for passing an award in his favour
and against the management with direction to the management to
reinstate him with back wages, continuity of service and consequential
benefits submitting that he joined the management 2 years back as a
Kharadia on monthly salary of Rs. 4000/- per month but has alleged that
the management did not provide him statutory facilities, although, he
had been performing duty to the utmost satisfaction of management
yet   the management terminated his service without assigning any
reason w.e.f. 30-3-06. He also alleged that the management     had not
paid full salary and has given Rs. 1000/- only as expenses. According
to the workman, when he made a demand for complete salary, the
management got annoyed and terminated his services after taking his
signatures forcibly and withheld his earned wages for the month of
December, January, February and March, 2006 besides bonus, leave
encashment for 2 years. He alleged that termination of his service
was illegal. He has performed duty with the management for more
than 240 days in each calendar year and has remained unemployed
since the date of termination of his service and therefore he was

LIR No. 36/11                                    Page 2 of 6
 entitled for the relief as prayed.
3      Management contested the claim by filing written-statement taking
preliminary objections that the claim was not maintainable because the
claimant    has concealed the true and material facts from the court;
that there existed no relationship of workman and management; that
management was running its operations at F-77, Phase-II, Mayapuri
Industrial Area and has no connection of premises bearing no. F-80;
that the claim being false and frivolous is liable        to be dismissed.
On merits, the contention of workman being an employee of the
management for the last two years as claimed has been denied. It is
submitted that      he was not in the employment of the management,
therefore       no question arose for payment of any salary or for
termination of      his service, remaining allegations   have   also been
denied.
4.     On pleadings of the parties, the following issues were framed on
7-8-08 as under :
                1.</pre><p id="p_1"> Whether there existed relationship of
                   employer and employee between the
                   parties? OPW
</p><p id="p_2">                2. As per terms of reference.
</p><p id="p_3">                3. Relief.
</p><p id="p_4">5.     In support of his claim, workman appeared in witness box as
WW-1 and tendered his affidavit Ex. WW-1/A relying on documents
Ex. WW1/1 to Ex. WW1/6 and after cross-examination, workman's
evidence was closed. On behalf of the management, MW1 Sh. R.S.
Singh, Proprietor of the management tendered Ex. MW1/A and after


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">LIR No. 36/11                                    Page 3 of 6</span>
 cross-examination, management's evidence was closed.
</p><p id="p_5">6.         I have heard the oral submissions made by Ld.   AR for the
workman and gone through the written submissions filed on behalf of
both the sides and my findings on the issues are as under:-
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">7.     ISSUE NO. 1</span>
<p id="p_6">       The onus to prove this issue was on the workman. On behalf of
the workman, it has been submitted by Ld. AR that the workman has
corroborated the averments made in the claim and      proved on record
the documentary evidence Ex. WW1/1 to Ex. WW1/6 and therefore he
is entitled for the relief as prayed.
</p><p id="p_7">       However, on behalf of the management, it has been submitted in
the written arguments that there was no relationship of employee
and employer       between the parties and the workman     was   never
appointed nor he worked with the management and the case has been
filed only in order to extort money and in absence of proof         of
employment, there was no question of any relationship between the
parties.
</p><p id="p_8">8.     The workman through his affidavit has relied on documents
Ex. WW1/1 to Ex. WW1/6.
</p><p id="p_9">       MW1 through his affidavit has testified that the workman was
never employed with the management and has filed a false claim.
In his cross-examination, MW1 has stated that he had not received
any demand notice; no labour inspector had visited the premises at
any time in respect of complaint dt. 12-4-06; he has not received any
notice of the labour inspector, the workman was never employed with


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">LIR No. 36/11                                Page 4 of 6</span>
 his firm. He denied the suggestion that the workman ever worked                for
two years and         dues    were pending     for     three months. He also
denied that the management has paid Rs. 1000/- as expenses to the
workman. He further denied the suggestion that the workman
worked with his management for two years and he terminated him
on     30-3-06.
</p><p id="p_10">       In his cross-examination, the claimant         has   stated   that      his
family members used to send letters to him but the proprietor used to
tear away these letters      and never    delivered the letters to him. He
admitted that proprietor never threw away any letter in his presence.
He admits that he did not make any complaint for not providing
him legal benefits. Ex. WW1/1 is the copy of demand notice              dt. 26-
4-06, Ex. WW1/2 is postal receipt, Ex. WW1/3 is UPC. Ex. WW1/4 is
copy of complaint to ALC, Ex. WW1/5 is letter of the labour inspector
given to the Union and Ex. WW1/6 is copy of claim filed before the
conciliation officer. As per authority reported as RANGE FOREST
OFFICER VS. ST HADIMANI, AIR 2002, SC 1147, Hon'ble Supreme
Court has held that "the burden to prove the relationship has to be
discharged by the workman and in this case he has failed to place
on record any documentary evidence such as letter of appointment,
I. Card, wage slip etc. and mere filing an affidavit is not sufficient
evidence        to believe   that   he   was in the      employment         of the
management.         The relationship of employee and employer               can be
proved by filing the letter of appointment, I. Card, wage slip etc. but
no such         document has been filed by the         claimant. He has not

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">LIR No. 36/11                                        Page 5 of 6</span>
 examined any co-worker nor has summoned any record from the
management or     from ESI and PF authority and therefore no adverse
inference against the management can be drawn. Therefore,            the
claimant has failed to prove that there existed any relationship.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">9.     ISSUE NO. 2 AND 3</span>
<p id="p_11">       The claimant has failed to prove on recored any written letter of
termination of service. He has failed to       establish on record that
there existed relationship of employee and employer between him and
the management as such the illegal termination of his service does not
arise. Therefore, he is not entitled for any relief.
</p><p id="p_12">10.    Reference accordingly stands answered. Copies of award be
sent for publication and case file be consigned to Record Room.
Announced in the open court
on 18th, APRIL 2011.
