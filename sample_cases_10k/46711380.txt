<p id="p_1">   1.                The  present   complaint   has   been   filed   on  25.09.2007   by  the 
       Delhi Administration through FI Sh. D.V. Singh against the accused Jagan 
       Nath. It is stated in the complaint that on 23.05.2007 at about 8.00 AM, FI 
       D.V. Singh purchased a sample of  Standardized Milk, a food article for 
       analysis from Sh. Jagan Nath  S/o Sh. Sharda Parshad from the premises of 
       M/s Allahabad Dairy, RZ­26, Shankar Park, West Sagarpur, New Delhi­
       110046, where the said article was found stored for sale and where accused 
       Jagan Nath was found conducting the business of the said food article at the 
       time of sampling.   FI Sh. D.V. Singh purchased 750 ml of  Standardized  
       Milk,  taken from an open drum having no label declaration.  The sample 
       was   taken  under   the   supervision   and   direction   of   Shri   S.S.   Parihar, 
       SDM/LHA  after   proper   homogenization   with   the   help   of   dry   and   clean 
       measure by rotating it in all  possible directions clockwise, anti clockwise, 
       up and down several times.  Thereafter, the sample was divided into three 
       equal parts by putting it in three separate clean and dry glass bottles and 20

         drops   of   formalin   were   added   to   each   bottle   and   thereafter   each   bottle 
        containing the sample was separately packed, fastened and sealed according 
        to the PFA Act and Rules.  The signatures of vendor were obtained on the 
        LHA slip and the wrapper of the bottles containing the sample.  Notice in 
        Form VI was given to accused and price of sample was also paid to the 
        accused   vide   vendor's   receipt   dated   23.05.2007.     Panchnama   was   also 
        prepared at the spot.  All these documents prepared by FI Sh. D.V. Singh 
        were  signed   by   accused     Jagan  Nath,   the   vendor   and   the   other  witness 
        namely Sh. Ranjit Singh, FA. It is stated that before taking the sample, 
        efforts were made to get the public witnesses to join the proceedings, but 
        none came forward and as such Sh. Ranjit Singh, FA joined as witness. 
</p><p id="p_2">   2.                  It is further stated that one counterpart of the sample bearing 
        LHA code No. 82/LHA/18705 in intact condition was sent to the Public 
        Analyst, Delhi and two counterparts of the sample in intact condition were 
        deposited with LHA.  The Public Analyst analyzed the sample and opined 
        that "The sample does not conform to standard because milk solids not fat  
        is less than the prescribed minimum limit of 8.5%".

        the Vendor­cum­Proprietor of M/s Allahabad Dairy at the time of taking 
        sample   and   as   such   he   is   in­charge   and   responsible   for   the   day   to   day 
        conduct of the business of the said shop.  Thereafter, the entire case file was 
        sent to the Director, PFA who accorded the requisite consent U/s 20 of the 
        Act and consequent thereto the present complaint was filed for violation of

        Sh. D.V. Singh, Food Inspector who conducted the sample proceedings as 
        PW­1, Sh. S.S. Parihar, the then SDM/LHA as PW­2 and Sh. Ranjit Singh,

        contended that the Food Inspector mixed the milk with the help of a milk 


CC No. 123/07
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">FI Vs. Jagan Nath                                                             Page 4 of 15</span>
        measure, whereas in order to proper homogenization or sterilization of the 
       milk, the Food Inspector should have mixed the milk with the Plunger, but 
       he  has  not  done  so,  and,  therefore the  milk was not properly stirred or 
       mixed. He further argued that the sample was taken from the upper layer 
       without proper homogenization which is evident from the fact that 'milk fat' 
       of the sample commodity was found on the higher side than the prescribed 
       standard, whereas at the same time the milk solids not fat was found less 
       than the prescribed standard and therefore, accused is entitled to be given 
       benefit of doubt. To fortify this argument, he has relied upon the judgment 
       passed by the Hon'ble Punjab and Haryana High Court in "Lekh Raj Vs.  
       U.T. Chandigarh, Criminal Revision No. 505 of 1986."   He has further 
       argued   that   the   'Gerber'   method   which   has   been   applied   by   the   Public 
       Analyst to detect the fat percentage in the sample commodity is not a sure 
       test   and   in   this   regard   he   has   relied   upon   the   judgment   passed   by   the 
       Hon'ble High Court of Delhi in "Corporation of the City of Nagpur  Vs.  
       Neetam Manikrao Kature and Ors..1998 SCC (Cri) 564". 
</p><p id="p_10">   10.                Ld. Counsel for accused has further argued that the deficiency 
       in the sample of Standardized Milk was only in respect of 'milk solids not  
       fat'  and if the percentage of 'milk fat' and 'milk solids not fat' are added, it 
       meets the total requirement of fat content of the sample commodity and, 
       therefore, sample cannot be said to have failed only on account of shortfall 
       in 'milk solids not fat'.  In this regard, he has relied upon the case law titled 
       as "Administrator of the City of Nagpur Vs.   Laxman &amp; Anr.   Crl. No.  

CC No. 123/07
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">FI Vs. Jagan Nath                                                                         Page 5 of 15</span>
        132 of 1986."   He further argued that there is marginal deficiency in the 
       sample in respect of 'milk solids not fat' and it is possible that there may be 
       judgment of error for which accused is liable to be given benefit of doubt. 
       To   fortify   this   argument,   he   has   placed   reliance   on   case   laws   titled   as 
       "Noratan Mal Vs. State of Rajasthan, Criminal Appeal No. 621 of 1988"  
       and "P.S. Sharma Vs. Madanlal Kasturichandji &amp; Anr. 2002 (2) FAC  
</p><p id="p_11">       224." 
</p><p id="p_12">   11.                On the other hand, Ld. SPP for complainant has argued that 
       Gerber method to detect the fat percentage in the sample is a valid test. He 
       further argued that sterilization of the milk in order to homogenize the same 
       can be done with the help of a milk measure or a plunger and it depends on 
       the structure or make of the container in which the milk is kept and in the 
       present case the milk was properly mixed with the help of milk measure. He 
       further argued that   sample commodity was required to be conforming to 
       the standard in respect of 'milk fat' and 'milk solids not fat' separately and 
       independently, whereas the sample commodity failed on account of  'milk  
       solids not fat', which was found less than the prescribed requirement and 
       therefore, even if  total  fat comes more than the prescribed requirement, 
       same is of no avail and hence accused is liable to be convicted.

       more or less as per the averments made in the complaint.

       business   of   food   article   including   Standardized   milk   ready   for   sale   for 
       human consumption. He further deposed that he disclosed his identity and 
       intention for purchasing the sample of Standardized milk lying in the open 
       drum bearing no label declaration, for analysis to which accused agreed 
       and, thereafter at about 8.00 AM, he purchased 750 ml Standardized milk 
       after   proper   homogenization   with   the   help   of   a   clean   and   dry   measure

        examination of PWs appears to be that proper method of mixing the milk 
       was not applied by the Food Inspector and a representative sample was not 
       taken by the Food Inspector as he lifted the sample from the upper layer of 
       the   milk   without   proper   homogenization   of   the   milk.   In   his   statement 
       U/s 313 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_5">Cr.P.C</a> also, the accused has contended that the sample was not 
       taken in a representative manner since the sample was taken from the upper 
       layer of the milk and therefore the fat is on higher side. 
</p><p id="p_25">   22.               It is evident from the report of Public Analyst Ex. PW1/F that 
       sample of Standardized Milk failed only in respect of 'milk solids not fat' 
       which   was   found   less   than   the   prescribed   minimum   limit.   As   per   Ld. 
       Counsel for accused, milk was not properly mixed by the Food Inspector as 
       he mixed the milk with the help of a milk measure, whereas he should have 
       mixed with milk the help of a plunger and, therefore, the milk was not 
       properly homogenized/ stirred which resulted in reducing of  'milk solids  
       not fat' in the sample. 
</p><p id="p_26">   23.               It is not in dispute that the Standardized Milk, sample of which 
       was taken in the present case, was lying in a drum. PW­1 in his cross­
       examination stated that there was about 25­30 liters of standardized milk in 
       the drum at the time of sampling and the capacity of the drum was about 
       70­80 liters. He further stated that milk was homogenized with the help of 
       measure which was already lying in the drum. As per PW­2, there was 
       about 15­20 liters of standardized milk in the drum at the time of sampling 
       and the capacity of the drum was about 40­50 liters. He stated that measure

        was already lying in the drum from which the sample was lifted.   PW­3 
       stated   in   his   cross­examination   that   total   capacity   of   the   drum   was 
       approximately   65­70   liters   and   there   was   approximately   25   liters   of 
       Standardized Milk was lying in the said drum at that time. 
</p><p id="p_27">   24.               From the aforesaid cross­examination of PWs, it is evident that 
       though there is contradiction in the statement of PWs regarding capacity of 
       the drum in which milk was lying, but it is not in dispute that before taking 
       the sample of Standardized milk, it was mixed by the Food Inspector with 
       the help of milk measure which was already lying in the drum. If it is so, it 
       was not possible to mix the entire milk lying in the drum, average capacity 
       of which was about 60 liters on the basis of statement of PWs, with the help 
       of milk measure upto the depth of the bottom of the drum and thus it cannot 
       be said that it was a proper method of mixing the sample commodity of 
       Standardized milk or that the milk was properly stirred. 
</p><p id="p_28">   25.                In a revision petition titled as Lekh Raj Vs. U.T. Chandigarh 
       (cited supra), a sample of Tonned milk was lifted by the Food Inspector 
       from the petitioner for analysis. The sample of Tonned milk was taken from 
       a Patila containing 10 Kg of milk and was sent to the Public Analyst, who 
       found it to be deficient in milk solids not fat than the minimum prescribed 
       standard,   while   the   fat   content   was   found   more   than   the   prescribed 
       standard. In the said case, the Food Inspector stirred the milk with a milk 
       measure and in those circumstance the Hon'ble Punjab and Haryana High 
       Court held that stirring the milk with the milk measure is not sufficient to

        conclude that the milk was properly stirred unless the milk is stirred with a 
       deep probe or by transferring the milk in the Patila to another vessel and 
       stirring it in the said process.  It was further held that stirring of the milk 
       with   a   milk   measure   would   result   in   blowing   it   and   separating   the   fat 
       contents from the milk solids. It was also observed by the Hon'ble High 
       Court of Punjab and Haryana that there is no explanation as to how fat 
       content will be more than the prescribed standard for tonned milk, while at 
       the   same   time   milk   solids   not   fat   would   be   lesser   than   the   prescribed 
       standard,   because   a  milk  vendor   is   not   expected  to   add  fat   in  the   milk 
       contents  being costlier than the milk itself and if a milk vendor adds water 
       to milk, it will result in reducing fat contents also, provided the sample is 
       taken after proper stirring and in those circumstance it was held that milk 
       was not taken after properly stirring it.
</p><p id="p_29">   26.                In the present case also, the 'milk fat' in the sample was found 
       6.5 % which is more than the prescribed minimum limit of 4.5% , whereas 
       'milk solids not fat' was found to the tune of 8.28% which is less than the 
       prescribed minimum limit of 8.5%. Had there been any adulteration in the 
       milk by the accused by adding water to it, the 'milk fat' should have also 
       been   reduced   in   the   sample,   as   observed   by   the   Hon'ble   Punjab   and 
       Haryana High Court in the authority cited supra, which in the present case 
       was found higher than the prescribed standard and it goes to show that milk 
       was not properly stirred or homogenized before taking the sample as also 
       contended by the accused.

       Ex. PW1/F,  the only shortfall in the sample of Standardized Milk was in 
       respect of 'milk solids not fat' which was found to be 8.28% as against the 
       minimum prescribed limit of 8.5%.   In an appeal filed before the Hon'ble 
       Supreme Court titled as Administrator of the City of Nagpur  Vs.  Laxman  
       &amp; Anr cited supra,   the sample of cow's milk was taken in which the fat 
       percentage was 6% as against 3.5%, which was more than the prescribed 
       for cow's milk.  The only shortfall was that SNF which was 7.3%, whereas 
       it ought to have been 8.5%.  Further, it was noted that the total solids are 
       13.37% which was again more than the satisfying standard of cow's milk 
       and   under   those   circumstance,   the   Hon'ble   Supreme   Court   held   that   it 
       cannot be said that courts below have erred in acquitting the accused giving 
       the benefit of doubt. 
</p><p id="p_32">   28.                Similarly, in   Sakeel Vs.  State of Haryana 2008 FAJ (506) 
       (P&amp;H), the analyst reported the sample adulterated as milk solid not fat 
       contents   were   7.7%   and   deficiency   was   to   the   tune   of   0.8%,  while   the 
       percentage of fat was 5.4% which was higher than the prescribed standard, 
       it   was   held   that   inference   could   be   drawn   that   either   sample   was   not 
       properly taken or analyzed or cow was not properly fed.  
</p><p id="p_33">   29.                The facts of the present case are squarely covered under the 
       aforesaid   authorities.   In   the   present   case   also,   as   per   report   of   Public 
       Analyst   (PA),   the   'milk   solids   not   fat'   of   the   sample   commodity   of 
       Standardized   milk   was   found   to   be   8.28%   as   against   the   minimum

        requirement of 8.5% and the 'milk fat' was found to be 6.5% as against the 
       prescribed minimum limit of 4.5% and if percentage of both 'milk fat' and 
       'milk solids not fat' are added, the total fat comes to 14.78% which is more 
       than the prescribed limit of 13%. Therefore, in view of law laid down in the 
       authority  cited   supra,   the   accused   can   not   be   convicted   on  the   basis   of 
       shortfall in SNF as total fats are more than the prescribed requirement.  
</p><p id="p_34">   30.                Not only this, it is also evident that there is only a marginal 
       deficiency   in  'milk   solids   not   fat'  which   was   found   8.25%   against   the 
       prescribed minimum limit of 8.5% and the difference came to only 0.25% 
       from the standard quantity. In an appeal titled as Noratan Mal Vs. State of  
       Rajasthan  relied upon by the Ld. Counsel for accused,  a sample of chilli 
       powder was purchased for analysis and total ash found in the sample was 
       8.38 % by weight against the prescribed requirement of 8 % by weight and 
       the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that, "The adulteration found in the instant  
       case being marginal, the possibility of there being an error of judgment in  
       analysis cannot be ruled out." 
</p><p id="p_35">   31.                In the present case also, since there is a marginal deficiency 
       of .25% in 'milk solids not fat' in the sample commodity, it is possible that 
       there may be error of judgment in the analysis by the Public Analyst and for 
       this reason also, the accused is liable to be given benefit of doubt.
