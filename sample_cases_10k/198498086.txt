                                For convenience sake, hereinafter parties will be referred to as

                   they were arrayed in the Court of first instance i.e. appellant as plaintiff

                   and respondents as defendants.
</p>
<p id="p_3">                                The detailed facts are already recapitulated in the judgments

                   of the Courts below and are not required to be reproduced. However, the

                   brief facts relevant for disposal of this second appeal are that plaintiff filed

                   suit for mandatory injunction claiming that defendant no.1 allotted one

                   booth site measuring 18.96 sq. mt. bearing No. 37-J in `550 Acre Scheme'

                   at Bhai Randhir Singh Nagar, Ludhiana for a sale consideration of Rs.

                   1,70,645/-. It is alleged that the plaintiff paid all the sale consideration in

                   the year 1997 and all formalities were fulfilled for taking possession of

                   site in question, but possession was not delivered to him. A legal notice

                   was given to the defendant on 26.12.2006. Thereafter, the plaintiff came to

                   know that said booth allotted to him had been attached by the Civil Courts

                   at Ludhiana and same had been auctioned by Court Auctioneer to satisfy

                   the claim of landholders whose land was acquired by the Government for

                   the benefit of Improvement Trust before the same could be transferred and

                   delivered to plaintiff. It is further alleged that the defendants were not in a

                   position to deliver possession of a shop constructed at Maharani Jhansi

                   Road, Ludhiana in lieu of originally allotted booth. The plaintiff is also

                   entitled to compensation for non delivery of the possession of booth in

                   question or a booth of same measurement at B.R.S. Nagar, Ludhiana or in

                   the alternative interest @ 24% per annum till delivery of possession along

                   with penal interest.

                                     Upon notice, defendants appeared and filed their separate

                   written statement.          Defendant no.1 in his written statement took

                   preliminary objection that no notice under Section 80 of the Punjab Town

                   Improvement Trust Act was served upon the defendants. On merits, it is

                   admitted that Booth No. 37-J in Bhai Randhir Singh Nagar was allotted to

                   the plaintiff and said booth was attached by the civil court but said

                   attachment had since been set aside the booth could be transferred to the

                   plaintiff after completion of all formalities. Rest of the averments made in

                   the plaint were denied. In his written statement, defendant no.2 took

                   preliminary objection to the maintainability of the suit and cause of action.

                   On merit, it is alleged that auction of booth by the Court Auctioneer was

                   not in their knowledge. It is further alleged that Booth No.37-J did not

                   belong to defendant no.2. Rest of the averments in the plaint were denied

                   and dismissal of the suit was prayed for.

<p id="p_8">                                      Learned counsel for the appellant at the outset stated that the

                   substantial questions of law involved in this appeal have been formulated

                   by him in the grounds of appeal which read as under:-

                                      sustainable in the eyes of law?
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_8">                               ii)    Whether the observation so made by the ld. Lower Appellate
                                      Court is justified and sustainable in the eyes of law?
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_9">                               iii)   Whether the appellant is entitled for compensation in the
                                      given circumstances,as claimed in the civil?
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_10">                               iv)    Whether the respondent no.1 can be permitted to take

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_11">                               v)     Whether the respondent no.1 was bound by the terms and

                   transferred in the name of the plaintiff nor possession of the same was

                   delivered to the plaintiff despite payment of its entire sale consideration.

                   Evidence of plaintiff remained unrebutted on record as defendants have

                   not led any evidence. Finding of fact has been recorded by the Courts

                   below that plaintiff was allotted booth plot and he had paid the entire

                   amount. The plaintiff was not delivered possession for 18 years. Since the

                   appellant has been given plot at the old price and considering the fact that

                   the suit for recovery and damages was required to be filed and not for

                   mandatory injunction, no compensation can be awarded. The relief for

                   damages has rightly been declined by both the Courts below. The only

                   point in this case is with regard to compensation and damages. The

                   plaintiff filed a suit for mandatory injunction but claimed specific amount

                   as damage whereof court fee was required to be affixed which has not

                   been assessed anywhere in the plaint.

                   the Courts below. In view of this, no question of law, much less substantial

                   question of law, as claimed, arises in this second appeal.

</p><p id="p_12">                               In view of above discussion, I do not find any illegality or
