    import of used tyres with one cut falls under Open General License

    samples   and   testing   of   import   consignments.     The   reason   for   the 
    notice was that the volume of import and export trade has expanded 
    over the last few years.  The Customs Laboratories do not necessarily 





    have the test equipment or facilities to conduct certain tests.  Hence, 
    in order to have a uniformity in approach for Laboratory testing, a 
    committee was constituted for the three Customs Houses in Mumbai 
    and   pursuant   to   the   recommendations   of   the   Committee,   the 
    procedure for drawal of samples and testing was formulated for cargo 
    of the normal type.  However, paragraph 3.1 of the notice also covers 
    special type of  cargo  such  as  vegetable  oils  and  hazardous  cargo.

    Part B of Schedule III of the Rules.  Such products, it is stated, can 
    be imported into the country only with the permission of Ministry of 





    Environment and Forests.   Similarly, tyres   scrap (multi cut and/or 
    shredded tyres) is also covered by item B-3140 of Part B of Schedule 
    III.    On  11 January  2011   the  Petitioners  applied   for   permission   to 
    import   30,000   MT   of   'end   of   life   tyres-scrap   with   multi 





    cuts /shredded'.  The application was considered by the Ministry of

    granted   for   the   import   of   20,000   MT   of   tyres   scrap   (multi
