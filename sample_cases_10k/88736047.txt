<p id="p_1">1.            The   present   FIR   was   registered   against   accused   u/s   379<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_3"> 

Indian   Penal   Code</a>  (hereinafter   referred   as   <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_4">IPC</a>)  at   the  behest  of 


                                        Page 1
 complainant Sachin. 
</p>
<p id="p_2">2.           The case of the prosecution is that on 22.06.2009 at 10:25 

am, complainant boarded in a bus from Red Fort.  At that time, accused 

alongwith some other boys also boarded in the bus and committed theft 

of  Rs. 3000/­ from the pocket of complainant and immediately handed 

over the same to some other boy namely Imtiyaz who was also present 

at the spot with him.  The boy to whom the money was handed over by 

accused ran away from the spot.  Accused was caught red handed.  on 

the basis of above allegations, the present  FIR was registered. 

</p><p id="p_3">3.           After   completion   of   investigation,   chargesheet   was   filed. 

Accused was summoned. Vide order dated 27.01.2011, charge u/s 379/34 

<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_5">IPC</a> was framed against accused to which he pleaded not guilty and 

claimed trial. Thereafter, matter was fixed for PE.

</p><p id="p_4">4.           In order to prove the charges against the accused persons, 

prosecution has examined 2 witnesses.
</p>
<p id="p_5">5.           PW­1   is   DO,   who   has   proved   the   registration   of   FIR 

Ex.PW1/A. 
</p>
<p id="p_6">6.           PW­2 is Ct. Jai Kishore, who stated that  on 22.06.2009 he 

alongwith SI Satpal was on patrolling in the area.   He further stated 

that at about 10:30 pm, when he reached near Red Light of Red Fort, he 

saw   one   person   (complainant)   was   chasing   the   accused   and 

apprehended him.  Thereafter, complainant handed over the accused to 

                                      Page 2
 this PW and stated that the accused has removed Rs. 3000/­ from his 

pocket   and handed over the same to his companion.   Thereafter, IO 

recorded   the   statement   of   complainant   and   prepared   the   rukka   and 

handed over the same to this PW for registration of FIR, accordingly, 

FIR   was  registered. Thereafter, accused   was  arrested  vide  memoand 

his personal search was conducted. Disclosure statement of accused is 

Ex. PW­2/C.
</p>
<p id="p_7">7.           The FIR of the present case was registered at the behest of 

complainant   Sachin.   Summons   were   sent   several   times   to   him   even 

through IO/SHO/DCP. Summons always received back with the report 

that he is not residing on the given address. The only material witness 

cited by prosecution was PW complainant who only could have proved 

that   accused   had   removed   Rs.   3000/­   from   his   pocket   without   his 

consent since this witness is not examined during trial therefore the 

prosecution has failed to prove its case.     The other witnesses cited or 

examined by the prosecution are only part of the investigation. Guilt of 

the accused cannot be recorded on the basis of evidence of witnesses 

who only participated in investigation. The case of the prosecution fails 

for want of evidence since the material witness remained unserved. No 

purpose shall be served by examining other formal witnesses. Hence, 

PE   stands   closed.   Statement   of   accused   dispensed   with.   Accused   is 

acquitted for the offence charged against him. Bail bonds and surety 

                                      Page 3
 bonds   cancelled.   Sureties   stood   in   the   present   case   are   discharged. 

Endorsement, if any, on any document regarding this case be cancelled. 

Originals, if any, be returned to the rightful claimant. Accordingly, file 

be consigned to Record Room.
