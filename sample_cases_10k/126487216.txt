BRIEF FACTS:
</p>
<p id="p_2">   2. Briefly stated facts of the case are that complainant is in the business 

      of   providing   freight   services   for   import   and   export   of   goods   for 

      foreign   countries   and   accused   is   in   the   business   of   providing   of 

      services   for   import   and   export   of   goods   to   its   clients.   Accused 

      approached   the   complainant   to   hire   its   services   for   April   2012   to 

      August 2012 for his client   M/s. Jai Shree Export, M/s. Icon Plastic 

      Pvt. Ltd. and M/s. Jindal Dhan Kutai Udhyog for carriage of goods. 

      The rates for providing the services for shipping and carriage by sea 

      were   mutually   agreed   and   accused   used   the   services   of   the 

      complainant   from   March   2012   to   September   2012.   Complainant 

      forwarded invoices and bills to the accused for payment amounting to 

      Rs.   14,89,746/­   and   out   of   that   accused   paid   Rs.   9,40,600/­   upto 

      August   2012.   He   assured   the   complainant   to   make   the   balance 

      payment shortly and in August 2012 he issued  cheque in question 

      bearing   No.   969659  dated   12.09.2012   for   Rs.   5,49,146/­   from   the 

      account  of his Proprietorship concern in favour of the complainant 

      which   is  Ex.   CW1/2.     When   the   cheque   was   presented   for 

      encashment, it got dishonoured with the reason " Funds insufficient" 

      vide bank returning memo dated 15.09.2012, which is  exhibit as Ex. 


</p><p id="p_3">CC No. 6551/1/12 PS Rajouri Garden                                                   2 of 6
       CW1/3.  Complainant sent a legal notice dated 18.10.2012, which  was 

      dispatched   on   19.10.2012.   The  legal   notice  is  Ex.   CW1/4  and   the 

      postal receipt of the legal notice is Ex.CW1/5. The legal notice was 

      duly received and AD card is Ex. CW1/6.
</p>
<p id="p_4">   3. In pre summoning evidence, AR of the complainant examined himself 

      as CW1 and exhibited his  affidavit in evidence  as  Ex. CW1/A  and 

      Resolution of the complainant  in his favour as  Ex. CW1/1. After 

      perusal   of   contents   of   complaint   and   pre   summoning   evidence, 

      summons   were   issued   to   the   accused   on   17.12.2012.   Notice   for 

      committing an offence under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_4">section 138</a> N.I. Act was served upon the 

      accused today to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. At the 

      time of framing of notice accused admitted that cheque in question 

      pertains to Bank account maintained in the name of the Proprietorship 

      concern   and   he   has   signed   the   cheque   and   all   the   remaining 

      particulars   i.e.   name   of   the   complainant,   amount   in   words   and 

      numbers except date were filled by him and space for date was left 

      blank. The cheque in question was given for security. He submitted 

      that he owes only Rs. 4,25,000/­ towards the complainant. Accused 

      admitted his business relations with the complainant. Accused failed 

      to   raise     any   probable   defence   to   discard   the   averments   of   the 

      complainant. Therefore, his right to cross examine the complainant 


CC No. 6551/1/12 PS Rajouri Garden                                                 3 of 6
       was closed. As version of the accused was already recorded at the 

      time   of   framing   of   notice,   statement   of   accused   under   <a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_5">section   313</a> 

      CrPC  was  dispensed   with. In absence of  any probable defence, no 

      opportunity was granted to accused to lead defence evidence. 

</p><p id="p_5">   4. I   have   heard   final   arguments   from   rival   parties   and   perused   the 

      judicial record. 
</p>
<p id="p_6">BRIEF REASONS FOR THE DECISION:
</p>
<p id="p_7">   5. It is alleged against the accused that he handed over one cheque to the 

      complainant in discharge of his liability which got dishonoured and 

      accused   failed   to   make  the   payment   of  the   cheque   amount   despite 

      service of legal notice. 
</p>
<p id="p_8">   6. The only plea of the accused is that the cheque was to be presented by 

      the complainant with his permission and that is why he had not filled 

      in   the   date   in   the   cheque.   Complainant   has   presented   the   cheque 

      without his permission and has filled in the date and has manipulated 

      the cheque. 
</p>
<p id="p_9">                   This defence has been taken by the accused at the time of 

      framing of notice. If we except this argument that date space in the 

      cheque was blank at the time of handing over to the complainant, even 

      then   accused   cannot   escape  from   the  liability.  This   issue   has   been 

      deliberated over by Hon'ble Delhi High Court in case title as <a href="/doc/143232225/" id="a_6">Vijender  

      Singh   vs   M/s   Eicher   Motors</a>   limited   and   Another   in   Criminal  

CC No. 6551/1/12 PS Rajouri Garden                                                   4 of 6
       M.C.No. 1454/2011, it has been held that once the accused admits the 

      signatures on the cheque, he cannot escape his liability on the ground 

      that the same was not filled in by him. When blank cheque has been 

      handed   over,   it   means   that   the   person   signed   it   has   given   implied 

      authority to the holder of the cheque to fill up the blank which he has 

      left. A person issuing a blank cheque is supposed to understand the 

      consequences of doing so.
</p>
<p id="p_10">              Therefore, in view of the above mentioned judgment the plea of 

      the accused that date in the cheque was not filled in by him, is of no 

      avail to the accused and hence, rejected. 
</p>
<p id="p_11">   7. As per the judgment passed by Hon'ble Supreme Court of India  in a 

      case titled as Rangappa Vs. Shri Mohan Criminal Appeal No. 1020  

      of   2010,   it   was   held   that   the   accused   is   only   expected   to   rebut 

      the presumptions of law on the scale of preponderance of probabilities 

      and not by proving the defence beyond reasonable doubt by adducing 

      sufficient   evidence   on   record.   Therefore,   no   reasonable   probable 

      defence has been raised which can compel the court to believe in its 

      existence. The accused has drastically failed to rebut the presumption 

      of law lying in favour of the complainant. Hence, the initial burden of 

      proof lying upon the accused remained undischarged. 

      DECISION:
</p>
<p id="p_12">   8. I   have   gone   through   the   material   placed   on   record   and   arguments 

CC No. 6551/1/12 PS Rajouri Garden                                                     5 of 6
       advanced by AR of the complainant and Ld. Counsel for accused. In 

      view of the above discussion, this court has reached the conclusion 

      that accused could not raise a probable defence which can be believed 

      by this  court.  All the essential ingredients of offence u/s 138 have 

      been complied with. As the accused could not discharge the initial 

      burden lying upon him, the onus never shifted upon the complainant. 

      Therefore, complainant has successfully established its case beyond 

      reasonable doubt. Hence, accused is found to be guilty and is hereby 

      convicted for committing offence under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_7">Section 138</a> N.I. Act.
