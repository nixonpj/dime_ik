                             ORAL JUDGMENT</pre>
<p id="p_1">     (PER : HONOURABLE MR.JUSTICE VIJAY MANOHAR SAHAI)


</p><p id="p_2">1.           We have heard Mr.Nachiket A.Dave, learned advocate
appearing for the appellant and Mr.Dipal R.Ravaiya, learned
advocate appearing for the respondent No.2.
</p>

<p id="p_3">2.           This Letters Patent Appeal has been filed by the
appellant-original       petitioner   challenging      the     order        dated
25.04.2014 passed in Special Civil Application No.6090 of 2014
whereby the notice has been issued in the writ petition but the
request for interim relief has been refused by the learned Single
Judge. The order dated 25.04.2014 passed by the learned Single
Judge is extracted below:
</p>
<p id="p_4">             "Notice returnable on 30.6.2014. In view of the facts of the
             case, the request for interim relief is refused."
</p>

<p id="p_5">3.           The counsel for the respondent No.2 has urged that the
Writ Petition and this Letters Patent Appeal are not maintainable
as the appellant-original petitioner has filed an application under
the Guardians and <a href="/doc/1608688/" id="a_1">Wards Act</a>, 1890 (for short the 'Act') and under
<a href="/doc/1608688/" id="a_2">Section 47</a> an Appeal from Order would lie to this Court.
</p>

<p id="p_6">4.           According to the learned counsel for the appellant, the
private respondent-wife of the appellant herein presented the
application for seeking interim custody of child before the Learned
Additional District Judge, Jamnagar vide Exhibit-22, came to be


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                  Page 2 of 7</span>
         C/LPA/973/2014                                JUDGMENT



allowed after conclusion of hearing vide its order dated 7 th April,
2014. As the aforesaid order was essentially under <a href="/doc/1359514/" id="a_3">Section 12</a> of
the Guardians and <a href="/doc/1608688/" id="a_4">Wards Act</a>, 1890, consequently therefore, no
remedy of filing either appeal or revision is provided under the
provisions of the Act and the order passed by the Additional
District Judge in the aforesaid application Exhibit-22 attains finality
under <a href="/doc/1608688/" id="a_5">Section 48</a> of the Act. In that view of the matter, the learned
counsel for the appellant has argued that there was no option
except to file the writ petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_6">Article 226</a> of the Constitution
otherwise he would have become remediless.
</p>

<p id="p_7">5.           We have carefully considered the argument of the
learned counsel for the respective parties and we are of the opinion
that the interim order granted or refused under <a href="/doc/1579945/" id="a_7">Section 12</a> of the
Act is a final order and attains finality in view of the <a href="/doc/1608688/" id="a_8">Section 48</a>
also, and therefore, remedy of the aggrieved person would be in
filing a writ petition before this Court and an appeal under <a href="/doc/1608688/" id="a_9">Section
47</a> would not be maintainable.
</p>

<p id="p_8">6.           Mr.Dipal Ravaiya, learned advocate for the respondent
No.2 then urged that even if the writ petition was maintainable
before the learned Single Judge and he has issued notice but has
refused to grant interim relief, the Letters Patent Appeal would not
be maintainable in view of the Five Judges' Full Bench of this Court
in the case of <a href="/doc/1728981/" id="a_10">Gujarat State Road Transport Corporation v. Firoze
M. Mogal and another</a>, 2014 GLH 1.
</p>
<p id="p_9">7.           The question that arises for consideration is as to
whether the High Court could entertain the writ in exercise of its
original jurisdiction or in exercise of its supervisory jurisdiction.
The Guardians and <a href="/doc/1608688/" id="a_11">Wards Act</a> is a special statute. It does not
provide any remedy of revision. The Provisions of Civil Procedure
Code is not applicable to the proceedings under the Guardians and



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                Page 3 of 7</span>
         C/LPA/973/2014                                         JUDGMENT



Wards Act and the proceedings are governed by the provision of
the Act itself. In such a situation, the High Court exercises powers
against a final order passed under the Act in its original jurisdiction
and does not exercise any power in supervisory jurisdiction. The
Five Judges Full Bench's in the case of Five Judges' Full Bench of
this Court in the case of Gujarat State Road Transport Corporation
(supra) in paragraph-254 has held as under:
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_1">             "iii) When a writ is issued under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_12">Article 226</a> of the
             Constitution, it is issued in exercise of its original
             jurisdiction whether against the Tribunal or inferior Court
             or administrative Authority.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">             vii) A writ of certiorari lies in appropriate cases against the
             order of Tribunal or Court subordinate to the High Court
             where such a Court, or Tribunal acts not only as an
             Authority of first instance but even if such a Court or
             Tribunal acts as an appellate or revisional Authority
             provided a case for a writ of certiorari is made out to the
             satisfaction of the Court concerned. Thus, if an appellate or
             revisional order of the Court or Tribunal, subordinate to a
             High Court, suffers from a patent error of law or
             jurisdiction, the same could be challenged before the High
             Court with the aid of <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_13">Article 226</a> of the Constitution and it
             could not be said that such an appellate or revisional order
             of the Court or Tribunal could be challenged with the aid of
             <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_14">Article 227</a> alone."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_10">8.           <a href="/doc/1608688/" id="a_15">Under the Act</a>, the provisions of Civil Procedure Code
had not been made applicable. The High Court exercises powers
under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_16">Article 226</a>, and not under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_17">Article 227</a> of the Constitution of
India. The original writ jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_18">Article 226</a> of the
Constitution conferred on the High Court cannot be ousted.
</p>

<p id="p_11">9.           For the aforesaid reasons, we are of the opinion that
the writ petition was filed before the High Court against the order
passed under <a href="/doc/1579945/" id="a_19">Section 12</a> of the Act could be challenged under
<a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_20">Article 226</a> of the Constitution invoking original jurisdiction of the
Court. Since the original jurisdiction was invoked the Appeal filed
under Clause 15 of the Letters Patent before this Court would be
maintainable.
</p>

<p id="p_12">            C/LPA/973/2014                                         JUDGMENT



</p><p id="p_13">10.             Further now coming to the merits of the case, we find
that the learned Additional District Judge granted the application
Exhibit-22 and ordered to hand over the custody of minor to the
private respondent. After pronouncement of the aforesaid order, he
also pleased to suspend the operation, implementation and
execution of the order dated 07.04.2014 at Exhibit-22 passed below
application at Exhibit-5 in Misc. Civil Application No.86 of 2013 for
a further period of 15 days in order to approach higher forum. On
filing the writ petition before the learned Single Judge, the
appellant argued for the suspension of order passed below -22
pending consideration of the writ petition, though the learned
Single Judge has issued the notice but has refused the request to
grant interim relief. It is always open to a Court to grant an interim
relief or to refuse the interim relief but the Court has to assign the
reasons for the same. There may be numerous reasons but some
reasons must exist on record for granting or refusing of the interim
relief. In absence of any reason, the order becomes vulnerable.
</p>

<p id="p_14">11.             It is well settled that while granting and/or refusing
interim order, the Court has to assign briefly some reason. The
Apex Court in the case of <a href="/doc/514236/" id="a_21">Oryx Fisheries Private Limited v. Union of
India and others</a>, (2010) 13 SCC 427 observed in paragraph 40 as
under :-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">           "40. In M/s Kranti Associates (supra), this Court after
           considering various judgments formulated certain principles in
           para 51 of the judgment which are set out below :-
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">               (a) In India the judicial trend has always been to record
               reasons, even in administrative decisions, if such
               decisions affect anyone prejudicially.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">               (b) A quasi-judicial authority must record reasons in
               support of its conclusions.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">               (c) Insistence on recording of reasons is meant to serve
               the wider principle of justice that justice must not only be
               done it must also appear to be done as well.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_7">               (d) Recording of reasons also operates as a valid restraint
               on any possible arbitrary exercise of judicial and quasi-
               judicial or even administrative power.

<blockquote id="blockquote_8"> C/LPA/973/2014                                         JUDGMENT




</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_9">    (e) Reasons reassure that discretion has been exercised
    by the decision maker on relevant grounds and by
    disregarding extraneous considerations.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_10">    (f) Reasons have virtually become as indispensable a
    component of a decision making process as observing
    principles of natural justice by judicial, quasi-judicial and
    even by administrative bodies.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_11">    (g) Reasons facilitate the process of judicial review by
    superior Courts.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_12">    (h) The ongoing judicial trend in all countries committed
    to rule of law and constitutional governance is in favour
    of reasoned decisions based on relevant facts. This is
    virtually the life blood of judicial decision making
    justifying the principle that reason is the soul of justice.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_13">    (i) Judicial or even quasi-judicial opinions these days can
    be as different as the judges and authorities who deliver
    them. All these decisions serve one common purpose
    which is to demonstrate by reason that the relevant
    factors have been objectively considered. This is
    important for sustaining the litigants' faith in the justice
    delivery system.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_14">    (j) Insistence on reason is a requirement for both judicial
    accountability and transparency.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_15">    (k) If a Judge or a quasi-judicial authority is not candid
    enough about his/her decision making process then it is
    impossible to know whether the person deciding is
    faithful to the doctrine of precedent or to principles of
    incrementalism.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_16">    (l) Reasons in support of decisions must be cogent, clear
    and succinct. A pretence of reasons or `rubber-stamp
    reasons' is not to be equated with a valid decision making
    process.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_17">    (m) It cannot be doubted that transparency is the sine
    qua non of restraint on abuse of judicial powers.
    Transparency in decision making not only makes the
    judges and decision makers less prone to errors but also
    makes them subject to broader scrutiny. (See David
    Shapiro in Defence of Judicial Candor (1987) 100
    Harward Law Review 731-737).
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_18">    (n) Since the requirement to record reasons emanates
    from the broad doctrine of fairness in decision making,
    the said requirement is now virtually a component of
    human rights and was considered part of Strasbourg
    Jurisprudence. See (1994) 19 EHRR 553, at 562 para 29
    and Anya vs. University of Oxford, 2001 EWCA Civ 405,
    wherein the Court referred to <a href="/doc/19636/" id="a_22">Article 6</a> of European
    Convention of Human Rights which requires, "adequate
    and intelligent reasons must be given for judicial
    decisions".

                  decision is of the essence and is virtually a part of "Due
                  Process".

<p id="p_15">12.                We do not find any reasons whatsoever has been given
by the learned Single Judge in refusing the interim relief.
Therefore, we are of the opinion that the order dated 25.04.2014 so
far as refusing the interim relief to the appellant cannot be
maintained and deserves to be set aside in part, except issuance of
notice.

<p id="p_16">13.                In the result, this Letters Patent Appeal succeeds and is
allowed in part. The order dated 25.04.2014 so far as refusing the
interim relief is quashed and set aside in part, except issuance of
notice. The matter is remanded back to the learned Single Judge to
consider the request for granting the interim relief afresh and may
pass appropriate reasoned order, expeditiously in accordance with
law at an early date, subject to His Lordship's convenience.

of 2014 also stands disposed of.
