                                       C.R.R. 3151 of 2009




                                Mr. Tirthankar Ghosh

                                                   ... For the petitioner

                                Ms. Chandri Alam

                                                       ... For the State




              Affidavit of service filed in Court today, be kept with the record.

              Heard learned Advocates for both parties.
</p>
<p id="p_2">              In the instant revisional application proceeding being C.R. Case No. 147 of 2009

        under <a href="/doc/1944660/" id="a_1">Sections 384</a>/<a href="/doc/1183069/" id="a_2">386</a>/<a href="/doc/1101188/" id="a_3">379</a>/<a href="/doc/329571/" id="a_4">392</a>/<a href="/doc/1897847/" id="a_5">120B</a> of the Indian Penal Code now pending before the

        learned Judicial Magistrate, 3rd Court at Durgapur, District- Burdwan has been

        challenged.
</p>
<p id="p_3">              Learned Advocate for the petitioner submits that on 30.6.2006 O.P. No. 2 entered

        into a Loan-cum-Hypothecation-cum- Guarantee Agreement with the said company for

        taking loan of Rs. 10,20,000/- for the purpose of purchasing of vehicle Eicher 3325

        which was subsequently registered under No. WB 39 9159. As per agreement he was due

        to pay monthly installment of Rs. 22,554/- in 58 installments and the vehicle was also

        hypothecated as collateral security but upto 20th August, 2009, O.P.No. 2 became

        default in payment of dues of such installment and the total outstanding amount was

        Rs.2,92,360/-. Ultimately, due notice was given to the O.P.No. 2, to pay the said

        amount. The O.P. No.2 has failed to repay the same and so they had no option but to

        take repossession of the vehicle on 26th November, 2008 which was however,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                            2</span>




subsequently seized and returned to the O.P. No.2 on executing a bond. Unfortunately,

O.P. No.2 lodged a complaint before the court of learned Additional Chief Judicial

Magistrte at Durgapur for taking repossession of the vehicle on account of default in

payment of monthly installments. After due consideration learned Magistrate was

pleased to take cognizance on 19th March, 2009.
</p>
<p id="p_4">      Learned Advocate for the petitioner has submitted that such cognizance is bad in

law because allegations do not constitute any offence under <a href="/doc/1944660/" id="a_6">Sections 384</a>/<a href="/doc/1183069/" id="a_7">386</a>/<a href="/doc/1101188/" id="a_8">379</a>/<a href="/doc/1897847/" id="a_9">120B</a>

of the Indian Penal Code.
</p>
<p id="p_5">      Learned Advocate for the State ,however, has opposed the same and contended

that such type of taking repossession of the vehicle on account of default is contrary to

the terms of agreement particularly Clause 10 (b) of the agreement entered into by and

between the parties dated 30.6.2006 and in terms of such agreement no notice was

given to the de facto complainant for production of the collateral security so as to make

it available to the secured party at the place which is reasonably convenient to both the

parties.
</p>
<p id="p_6">      I have carefully considered the submissions made by both the parties, perused

the F.I.R. and other connected papers. It appears that on 30th June, 2006, the petitioner

herein, issued a notice to O.P.No.2, asking him to pay a sum of Rs. 73993.69 P within

seven days on the date of the receipt of the letter otherwise they shall be constrained

to take necessary action including repossession of the above vehicle as per terms and

conditions of the Loan/HP agreement entered into by and between the parties.

</p><p id="p_7">      Learned Advocate for the State has submitted that at this stage documents filed

by the accused cannot be look into by this Court.
</p>
<p id="p_8">      I do not subscribe to such view because if any document is required for proper

adjudication of the matter, the revisional court can look into such document to prevent
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                             3</span>




miscarriage of justice and the court cannot arrive at a decision merely on subjective

satisfaction on alleged fact.
</p>
<p id="p_9">      Learned Advocate for the petitioner has drawn my attention to a case reported in

CHN 2007 Vol. 2 1029 of the Single Judge of this Hon'ble Court ( <a href="/doc/1084275/" id="a_10">Amitava Saha &amp; Ors. -

vs- State of West Bengal &amp; Another</a>), in which it was held like circumstances that a

financer is within his right to seize a vehicle which was purchased by the hirer at the

finance provided by the financer, if the instalment are not paid within the stipulated

time more particularly when the hire purchase scheme contained specified default

clause permitting the financer to re-possess the vehicle in such default. His Lordship

decided the case relying upon the principle laid down in A.I.R. 1979 S.C. 850 (<a href="/doc/1271780/" id="a_11">Trilok

Singh &amp; Ors. -vs- Satya Deo Tripathi</a>) and S.C.C., 2001 (7) SCC 417 (<a href="/doc/1036461/" id="a_12">Charanjit Singh

Chadha &amp; Ors. -vs- Sudhir Mehra</a>).
</p>
<p id="p_10">      Relying upon the said principle, I hold that in the instant case, since the alleged

seizure of the hypothetic vehicle was made after due notice to the parties, the act done

by the financer does not constitute to disclose any offence under <a href="/doc/1101188/" id="a_13">Sections 379</a>/<a href="/doc/1944660/" id="a_14">384</a> of

the Indian Penal Code and as such, cognizance taken thereto, is bad in law and is not

sustainable and if such proceeding is allowed to continue, it will be mere abuse of

process of law. To prevent it, the proceeding being C.R. Case No. 147 of 2009 under

<a href="/doc/1944660/" id="a_15">Sections 384</a>/<a href="/doc/1183069/" id="a_16">386</a>/<a href="/doc/1688284/" id="a_17">387</a>/<a href="/doc/1101188/" id="a_18">379</a>/<a href="/doc/329571/" id="a_19">392</a>/<a href="/doc/1128948/" id="a_20">120</a> of the Indian Penal Code pending before the learned

Judicial Magistrate, 3rd Court, Durgapur, District- Burdwan is hereby quashed and the

accused is discharged and released from his bail bond.

</p><p id="p_11">      The revisional application is accordingly disposed of.

      Certified Photostat copy of this order, if applied for, be given to the respective

parties.
