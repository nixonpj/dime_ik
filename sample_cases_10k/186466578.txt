AUGUSTINE GEORGE MASIH, J. (ORAL)

<p id="p_1">          Counsel for the petitioner contends that after the passing of the

order dated 30.03.2011 by a Division Bench of this Court in CWP No. 6090

of 2010 titled as <a href="/doc/1957992/" id="a_1">Tilak Raj vs. State of Haryana and others</a>, whereby a

direction was issued to the State of Haryana that the Guest Faculty Teachers

shall not be allowed to continue beyond 31.03.2012, an application i.e. C.M.

No. 17483 of 2011 for continuing the Guest Faculty Teachers beyond the

said date, was moved in the High Court by the State of Haryana with a

proposal, specifying therein the time schedule within which regular

appointments would be made, but the said application was rejected by this

Court, vide order dated 15.03.2012. State of Haryana and some other Guest

Faculty Teachers approached the Hon'ble Supreme Court by filing Special

Leave Petitions. In Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No. 5956 of 2012 titled

as <a href="/doc/1541426/" id="a_2">Naresh Kumar and others vs. State of Haryana and others</a>, the Hon'ble

Supreme Court, vide order dated 30.3.2012, ordered that no fresh

appointments of Guest Teachers shall be made after 1.4.2012 and the

exercise indicated in the affidavit dated 19.3.2012 affirmed by the Financial

Commissioner and Principal Secretary to Government of Haryana, School

Education Department to adhere to the time schedule must be completed

within time specified in the Scheme and no further extension or deviation

therefrom will be permitted. It was further ordered that till then, the Guest

Teachers may be allowed to continue to function as they have been doing so

far.
</p>
<p id="p_2">          He on this basis submits that as per the schedule given by the

Government of Haryana and the above order of the Hon'ble Supreme Court,

the Guest Faculty cannot continue in service beyond 31.12.2012.

</p><p id="p_3">          On a Public Interest Litigation filed in this Court, an order dated

10.09.2012 was passed in CWP No. 3990 of 2012 titled as <a href="/doc/169930353/" id="a_3">Bijender Kumar

vs. State of Haryana and others</a>, on the basis of which, the order terminating

the services of the petitioner has been passed by the Director,

Elementary/Secondary Education, Haryana. Challenging the said order,

some of the Guest Faculty Teachers approached the Hon'ble Supreme Court

by filing Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No. 18434 of 2012 titled as

<a href="/doc/43274129/" id="a_4">Neelam Kumari and others vs. State of Haryana and others</a>, in which, vide

order dated 19.10.2012, Special Leave to Appeal stands granted and notice

has been issued. In the meantime, having regard to the earlier order dated

30.03.2012 passed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in SLP No. 5956 of 2012,

<a href="/doc/1541426/" id="a_5">Naresh Kumar and others vs. State of Haryana and others</a>, where it was

observed that the Guest Teachers shall be allowed to continue as they had

been doing, the impugned order of the High Court dated 10.09.2012 has

been stayed.
</p>
<p id="p_4">          Notice of motion was issued by this Court and the operation of the

order terminating the services of the petitioner was stayed.

</p><p id="p_5">          Counsel for the respondents prays for an adjournment to file reply

to the writ petition.
</p>
<p id="p_6">          Counsel for the petitioner contends that the petitioner be allowed

to continue in service till 31.12.2012 as per the order passed by the Hon'ble

Supreme Court.
</p>
<p id="p_7">          In the light of the facts and submissions made by the counsel for

the petitioner as recorded above, this Court is of the view that reply on

behalf of the State is not necessary as in the light of the Supreme Court

order Guest Teachers would continue in service till 31.12.2012.

</p><p id="p_8">          The present petition is disposed of with directions to the

respondents to allow the petitioner to continue in service till 31.12.2012, on

which date, the services of the petitioner shall automatically stand

terminated. Liberty is, however, granted to the petitioner to approach the

Court in case the Hon'ble Supreme Court grants further extension in service

to the Guest Faculty Teachers.
