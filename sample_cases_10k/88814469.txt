</pre><p id="p_10">1.    RSA No.129/2002 has been filed by the appellants challenging

the judgment and decree dated 26.04.2002 passed by the learned

Civil Judge (Senior Division), Lakhimpur, at North Lakhimpur in Title

Appeal No.2/1999 thereby reversing the judgment and decree

dated 12.07.1999 passed by the learned Civil Judge (Junior

Division), Lakhimpur at North Lakhimpur in Title Suit No.2/1998

dismissing the counter-claim of the respondent/defendant No.1 .

RSA No.1/2003 has been preferred by the appellants against the

judgment and decree dated 26.04.2002 passed by the learned Civil

Judge (Senior Division), Lakhimpur, at North Lakhimpur in Title

Judge (Junior Division), Lakhimpur, at North Lakhimpur in Title Suit

No.2/1998 whereby the suit of the appellants/plaintiffs had been

dismissed.   Since both the Second Appeals arises from Title Suit

No.2/1998 wherein the present appellants were the plaintiffs and

the respondent No.1/defendant No.1 was the defendant No 1/

counter-claimant and having regard to the fact that        common

questions of law arises for adjudication in both the Second Appeals,

<p id="p_11">
</p><p id="p_12">2.    The plaintiffs/appellants case, in brief, is that the plaintiff Nos.1

and 2 as well as the defendant No.2/respondent No.2 are the sons

of Late Rashram Borah. The proforma defendant Numali Borah alias

Baruah is the married daughter of Late Rashram Borah.                  The

defendant No.1/respondent No.1 is the son of the defendant

No.2/respondent No.2. The suit land described in the plaint originally

belonged to Rashram Borah forming a part and parcel of the land

and property owned and possessed by him. On 24.06.1962 Late

Rashram Borah had affected a partition of his moveable and

immoveable properties amongst his three sons i.e. the plaintiffs and

the defendant No.2 whereby the entire property was divided into

four parts. One part each went to both the plaintiffs and the

defendant No.2 whereas Rasharam Borah retained the fourth part

for his own benefit. In order to honour the aforesaid partition,

Rasharam Borah had even started living at Sumanibari by

constructing a new house thereat wherein he used to stay with his

wife and the defendant No.1 i.e. his grandson. Rasharam Borah

died in the year 1975. After the death of Rasharam Borah, as per his

wishes expressed during the lifetime the share held by Rashram

Borah was amicably partitioned amongst his three sons i.e. plaintiff



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                                               Page 4 of 21</span>
 Nos.1, 2 and the defendant No.2. However, while the plaintiffs were

enjoying the possession of their share of the land pursuant to the

amicable partition between the three brothers, the defendant No.1

without the knowledge of the plaintiffs had attempted to get his

name mutated in respect of the land described in Schedule-A &amp; B

to the plaint, being the land falling in the share of Rasharam Borah.

However, on the face of objection raised by the plaintiffs, the

Deputy Commissioner, Lakhimpur had passed an order dated

29.03.1996 in Misc. Case No.9/1993 directing the parties to maintain

status quo in respect of the old recorded mutation. It is the case of

the plaintiffs that the defendant No.1 had also filed a proceeding

under <a href="/doc/1405190/" id="a_1">Section 145</a> of the Cr.P.C. vide Misc. Case No.159/1994 in

which proceeding the defendant No.1 had disclosed that on

12.04.1975 Rasharam Borah had executed a gift deed in his favour

gifting away the Schedule-A &amp; B land to the defendant No.1.

Asserting that Late Rashram Borah had never executed any gift

deed in favour of the defendant No.1 and that the said defendant

No.1 was never in possession of the Schedule-A &amp; B land, the

plaintiffs had instituted Title Suit No.2/1998 in the Court of Civil Judge

(Junior Division), Lakhimpur, inter alia, praying for a decree

declaring the right, title and interest of the plaintiffs in respect of the

suit land as well as for confirmation of possession. In the aforesaid

suit the appellants/plaintiffs had also prayed for cancellation of the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                                               Page 5 of 21</span>
 registered deed of gift bearing No.810/75 dated 12.04.1975 on the

ground that the same was invalid, void and inoperative in the eye

of law.
</p>
<p id="p_13">
</p><p id="p_14">3.    The defendant Nos.1 and 2 contested the suit by filing a joint

written statement-cum-counter - claim urging that there was no

cause of action for the suit and that the same was not maintainable

in law as well as in facts. The contesting defendants had also urged

that the plaintiff's suit was barred by law of limitation. In their written

statement, the said defendants, while admitting the fact of partition

of the properties of Late Rasharam Borah on 24.06.1962, asserted

that pursuant to such partition Late Rashram Borah had separated

himself from the plaintiffs as well as the defendant No.2 but the

defendant No.1 being his grandson continued to live with Rasharam

Borah and his wife. The defendant No.1 used to look after his

grandparents very well and, therefore, they also used to treat him

like their own son. Being highly satisfied with the services rendered

by the defendant No.1, Late Rashram Borah, during his lifetime, had

gifted away his entire share of land to the defendant No.1, out of

love and affection, by means of the registered deed of gift dated

12.04.1975 and the gift was also accepted by the defendant No.1.

Since then the defendant No.1 has been in possession of the suit

land and his name has also been mutated in the land records



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                                               Page 6 of 21</span>
 based on such deed of gift and his possession. The contesting

defendants had also denied that Late Rasharam Borah had ever

advised his sons to partition his share of land amongst themselves

after his death. On such basis the contesting defendants while

praying for dismissal of the plaintiffs' suit had also made a counter-

claim for passing a decree declaring their right, title and interest

over the land based on the registered deed of gift dated 12.04.1975

and also for confirmation of possession in respect of the land

covered by dag No.447; alternately, a decree for recovery of khas

possession of the land if the same is found not to be in possession of

the defendant No.1.
</p>
<p id="p_15">
</p><p id="p_16">4.    The plaintiffs had also filed their written statement opposing

the counter-claim generally denying the averments made in the

counter-claim. The plaintiffs had also categorically denied the

execution of the gift deed by Rasharam Borah           as has been

claimed by the contesting defendants.
</p>
<p id="p_17">
</p><p id="p_18">5.    Based on the pleadings of the parties, the learned trial Court

framed as many as 8 issues, which are as follows :-

<p id="p_19">6.    In the course of trial the plaintiffs' side had examined four

witnesses and exhibited four documents whereas the defendants'

side had examined six witnesses and exhibited six numbers of

documents. After hearing the leaned counsel for the parties and on

appreciation of the materials available on record the learned trial

court was pleased to record a finding in respect of Issue No.2

against the plaintiffs by holding that the gift deed being one

pertaining to the year 1975 and the suit having been filed in the

year 1998 the same was barred by law of limitation in view of the

prescriptions of <a href="/doc/1408921/" id="a_2">Article 56</a> of the <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_3">Limitation Act</a>, 1963. Having held so,

the learned trial Court had also decided the Issue No.4 against the

counter claimant by holding that the counter claimant/defendants

could not prove the due execution of the gift deed (Ext-Ga) and



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                                              Page 8 of 21</span>
 that the said gift deed was not valid in the eye of law. The Issue

Nos.2 and 4 having been answered against the plaintiffs and the

defendants/counter claimants, respectively, the learned trial Court

had dismissed the suit filed by the plaintiffs as well as the counter

claim made by the defendants by the common judgment and

order dated 12.07.1999.
</p>
<p id="p_20">
</p><p id="p_21">7.    Being aggrieved by the judgment and decree dated

12.07.1999 passed by the learned trial Court in Title Suit No.2/1998

the defendant No.1/counter claimant as appellant had preferred

Title Appeal No.2/1999 in the Court of learned Civil Judge (Senior

Division), North Lakhimpur. Similarly, aggrieved by the aforesaid

judgment and decree dated 12.07.1999 the plaintiffs as appellants

had also preferred Title Appeal No.3/1999.

<p id="p_22">
</p><p id="p_23">8.    By the judgment and decree dated 26.04.2002 passed in Title

Appeal No.2/1999 the learned Civil Judge (Senior Division), North

Laklhimpur had reversed the judgment and decree passed by the

learned trial Court and went on to decree the counter- claim filed

by the defendant No.1 thereby reversing the findings and

conclusions recorded by the trial Court in respect of Issue No.4. The

learned First Appellate Court was of the view that the execution of

the gift deed had been duly proved by the DW1 i.e. the defendant

No.1/counter claimant himself     by identifying the signatures of


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                                          Page 9 of 21</span>
 Rasharam Borah as Exts-Ga(1), Ga(2) and Ga(3). It was further held

that the plaintiffs' side did not raise any objection while exhibiting

the gift deed and also no objection was raised while exhibiting the

signature of the donor Late Rashram Borah. Therefore, the

execution of the gift deed stood proved and established in the eye

of law. The learned First Appellate Court had also gone on to hold

that since the defendant No.1 had accepted the gift made by the

deed No.810/75, hence the Ext-Ga gift deed             executed by

Rasharam Borah in favour of the said defendant No.1 was a valid

one. Based on such finding the learned First Appellate Court had

decreed the counter- claim filed by the defendant No.1.


</p><p id="p_24">9.    By a separate judgment dated 26.04.2002 passed in Title

Appeal No.3/1999 the learned First Appellate Court had dismissed

the Title Appeal filed by the plaintiffs/appellants, primarily, on the

ground that the claim for cancellation of registration of the gift

deed No.810/75 was barred by time. It was further held that the suit

land described in the plaint was not properly identifiable and

therefore, the plaintiffs' suit could not be decreed. On such

observation the judgment and decree of dismissal passed by the

trial Court was upheld by the First Appellate Court.

cause list.

<p id="p_31">
</p><p id="p_32">14.    Mr. Deka, learned counsel for the appellants, submits that the

execution of the gift deed having been disputed and denied in

categorical terms by the plaintiffs, it was incumbent upon the

defendant No.1/counter claimant to prove and establish the

execution of the same in accordance with law. The counter

claimant having failed to do so, the learned trial Court had rightly

rejected his claim of having acquired title over the suit land on the

basis of the said registered deed of gift. There was no apparent

justification for the First Appellate Court to reverse such finding of

fact in respect of Issue No.4 by ignoring the fact that the counter-

claimant had not been able to examine the attesting witness or

prove the execution of the deed in accordance with law.



</p><p id="p_33">15.   By inviting the attention of this Court to the provision of <a href="/doc/515323/" id="a_4">Section

123</a> of the Transfer of Property Act, Mr. Deka further submits that as

per the said provision a gift deed in order to be valid in the eye of

law is required to be attested by at least two witnesses. A bare

perusal of the Ext-Ga gift deed would go to show that there was

only one person by the name "Bogamal Das" who had purportedly

however, not examined Bogamal das as a witness.

Venkata Sastri and Sons and others</a>, reported in AIR 1969 SC 1147

Mr. Deka further submits that in the said decision the Hon'ble Apex

Court has laid down in clear terms as to the true import and

meaning of the definition 'attested' in <a href="/doc/1345438/" id="a_6">Section 3</a> of the Transfer of

Property Act. It has been categorically held that in the case of

attestation the person putting his signature in the document must

put his signature for the purpose of attesting the document and not

for any other purpose. Therefore, it was incumbent upon the

counter-claimant to establish that there were two attesting

witnesses who had put their signature in the Ext-Ga for the purpose

of attesting the same. The defendant No.1 having failed to

discharge such obligation cast upon him under the law, the learned

First Appellate Court committed manifest illegality in decreeing the

counter claim filed by the defendant No.1.

 stage that any such question arises for decision of this court in RSA

No 1 of 2003.
</p>
<p id="p_37">
</p><p id="p_38">18.   I have considered the submissions made by Mr. Deka, learned

counsel for the appellants   and have also perused the records. It is

not in dispute that the moveable and immoveable properties that

originally belonged to Late Rasharam Borah had been divided into

four parts in the year 1962 during his lifetime pursuant whereto the

plaintiff Nos.1, 2 and the defendant No.2 had been put in possession

in respect of one part each whereas Rasharam Borah had retained

one part for his own possession and benefit. Such being the position,

the rights and possession of the plaintiff Nos.1, 2 and the defendant

No.2 can be said to have crystalised as regards the land in their

respective possession    pursuant to the partition carried out on

24.06.1962 which fact has not been denied or disputed by either

parties . The core question that would , therefore, arise for

determination is as to the rights and entitlement of the legal heirs in

respect of that part of the property held by Rashram Borah himself

until his death in the wake of the claim made by the defendant No

1 based on the registered deed of gift.
</p>
<p id="p_39">
</p><p id="p_40">19.    Under the provisions of the <a href="/doc/685111/" id="a_7">Hindu Succession Act</a>, the

properties of a person dying intestate would devolve upon his legal

heirs by operation of law. Therefore, after the death of Rashram


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">                                                           Page 14 of 21</span>
 Borah the property belonging to him would automatically devolve

upon his surviving legal heirs which in the present case would be the

plaintiff Nos.1, 2 and the defendant No.2 and the proforma

defendant Numali Borah, since the wife of Rashram Bora had

already died in the year 1992. If, however, the claim made by

defendant No.1 based on the registered deed of gift is found to be

valid then, of course, the position would be different.


</p><p id="p_41">20.   From a perusal of the gift deed Ext-Ga it is apparent on the

face of the record that the said gift deed, although a registered

document, has not been attested by two witnesses as per the

requirement of <a href="/doc/515323/" id="a_8">Section 123</a> of the Transfer of Property Act. <a href="/doc/515323/" id="a_9">Section

123</a> of the Transfer of Property Act reads as follows :-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_16">                   "123. Transfer how effected.-- For the purpose of
             making a gift of immoveable property, the transfer must
             be effected by a registered instrument signed by or on
             behalf of the donor, and attested by at least two
             witnesses.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_17">                   For the purpose of making a gift of moveable

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_18">                   Such delivery may be made in the same way as
             goods sold may be delivered."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_42">21.   A reading of the provisions of <a href="/doc/515323/" id="a_10">Section 123</a> of the Transfer of

Property Act goes to show that gift of immoveable property can be



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                                                          Page 15 of 21</span>
 effected by (1) a registered instrument signed by or on behalf of the

donor and (2) attested by at least two witnesses. The usage of the

term "at least"     in <a href="/doc/515323/" id="a_11">section 123</a> makes the attestation of the

registered instrument by    minimum two witnesses as mandatory.

Therefore, If a gift deed is not attested by at least two witnesses the

same would not be a valid gift within the meaning of <a href="/doc/515323/" id="a_12">Section 123</a> of

the Transfer of Property Act and hence, confer any title to the

donee in respect of the immoveable property.
</p>
<p id="p_43">
</p><p id="p_44">22.   There is another aspect of the matter which needs to be

pointed out herein. A perusal of the pleadings contained in the

plaint goes to show that the plaintiffs had unequivocally denied the

execution of the deed of gift by Rasharam Borah. Such being the

position the burden of proving the due execution of the gift deed

was wholly cast upon the defendant No.1 who was claiming the

benefit under the said document.

</p><p id="p_46">23.   <a href="/doc/63662/" id="a_13">Section 68</a> of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 lays down the

manner of proof of execution of document required by law to be

attested. As per <a href="/doc/1166338/" id="a_14">Section 68</a>, once the execution of a document,

required by law to be attested, by the person by whom it purports

to be executed is specifically denied, the said document shall not

be used in evidence unless at least one attesting witness had been

 called for the purpose of proving its execution. In the instant case,

from a perusal of the evidence on record it is apparent that the

defendant No.1 had not called the attesting witness to depose

before the Court nor has the scribe of the deed been examined as

a witness. As a matter of fact, there was no identification of the

signature of the donor and the attesting witness by examining any

independent witness. Even assuming that the sole attesting witness

was not alive at the relevant point of time even in that case the

due execution of the gift deed ought to have been proved as per

the provision of <a href="/doc/613078/" id="a_15">Section 69</a> of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 by

proving the fact that attestation of one attesting witness at least is

in his own handwriting and that the signature of the person

executing the document is in the handwriting of that person.


</p><p id="p_47">24.   From a scrutiny of the evidence on record, there is no doubt

about the fact that in the instant case the defendant / counter-

claimant has failed to prove the due execution of the registered

deed of gift (Ext-Ga) under which he was claiming title in respect of

the suit land.   The fact that the plaintiffs had not raised any

objection when the document was marked as an exhibit cannot

dispense with the   requirement of proof     of Exhibit -Ga deed in

accordance with law particularly when its execution had been

categorically denied by the plaintiff side in their pleadings.     The



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">                                                          Page 17 of 21</span>
 execution of the gift deed not having been proved in accordance

with law, the question as to whether the donee had accepted the

gift or not would be wholly      inconsequential in the facts and

circumstances of the case.
</p>
<p id="p_48">
</p><p id="p_49">25.   In the above context it would be useful to refer to the

observations made by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of M. L.

Abdul Jabbar Sahib (supra) which reads as follows :-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_19">         "8. <a href="/doc/1345438/" id="a_16">Section 3</a> of the Transfer of Property Act gives the
         definition of the word "attested" and is in these words:
          " 'Attested' in relation to an instrument, means and
          shall be deemed to have meant attested by two or
          more witnesses each of whom has seen the executant
          sign or affix his mark to the instrument, or has seen
          some other person sign the instrument in the presence
          and by the direction of the executant, or has received
          from the executant a personal acknowledgment of his
          signature or mark, or of the signature of such other
          person, and each of whom has signed the instrument in
          the presence of the executant; but it shall not be
          necessary that more than one of such witnesses shall
          have been present at the same time and no particular
          form of attestation shall be necessary."
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_20">      It is to be noticed that the word "attested", the thing to be
      defined, occurs as part of the definition itself. To attest is
      to bear witness to a fact. Briefly put, the essential
      conditions of a valid attestation under <a href="/doc/1345438/" id="a_17">Section 3</a> are: (1)



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">                                                        Page 18 of 21</span>
       two or more witnesses have seen the execulant sign the
      instrument    or   have   received   from    him   a    personal
      acknowledgment of his signature; (2) with a view to attest
      or to bear witness to this fact each of them has signed the
      instrument in the presence of the executant. It is essential
      that the witness should have put his signature animo
      attestandi, that is, for the purpose of attesting that he has
      seen the executant sign or has received from him a
      personal acknowledgment of his signature. If a person puts
      his signature on the document for some other purpose,
      e.g., to certify that he is a scribe or an identifier or a
      registering officer, he is not an attesting witness."
</blockquote>


<p id="p_50">26.    From the above discussions, it is, therefore, clear that in case

of a registered deed of gift within the meaning of <a href="/doc/515323/" id="a_18">section 123</a> of the

Transfer of Property Act, the same is required to be compulsorily

attested by at least two witnesses. When the execution of the gift

deed is denied by taking a plea that the same had not been

executed by the person by whom it purports to have been

executed, the due execution of the same will have to be proved in

accordance with <a href="/doc/63662/" id="a_19">section 68</a> of the Evidence Act, 1872 failing which

the document itself cannot be used as evidence. The donee must

also prove and establish the fact that the attesting witness had

signed the document animo attestendi . For the purpose of

compliance with the requirement of <a href="/doc/1166338/" id="a_20">section 68</a> if no           attesting

witness is found to be alive or even if alive is found to be incapable


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">                                                          Page 19 of 21</span>
 of giving evidence, then the donee will be mandatorily required to

prove the execution of the gift deed as per <a href="/doc/613078/" id="a_21">section 69</a> of the

Evidence Act. Unless the requirements of <a href="/doc/1166338/" id="a_22">section 68</a> or <a href="/doc/613078/" id="a_23">section 69</a> of

the Evidence Act, as the case may be , is complied with , the gift

deed itself will be in-admissible in evidence.


</p><p id="p_51">27.     From a meticulous examination of the evidence on record

this court has no hesitation in holding that the defendant / counter-

claimant has not been able to prove the execution of the gift deed

as per <a href="/doc/1166338/" id="a_24">sections 68</a> or 69    of the <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_25">Evidence Act</a>. Since in the present

case, the defendant No.1 has failed to prove and establish the due

execution of the gift deed in accordance with law, hence the

counter -claim filed by the defendant No.1 could not have been

decreed by the learned First Appellate Court. Such being the

position, it is held that the judgment and decree dated 26.04.2002

passed in Title Appeal No.2/1999 is not sustainable in the eye of law

and the same is hereby set aside. The first substantial question of

law framed by this court stands answered accordingly.


</p><p id="p_52">28.   Since it has already been held that the defendant / counter-

claimant has failed to prove the due execution of the gift deed

exhibit-Ga, hence an answer to the second substantial question of

law is deemed to be redundant in the facts and circumstances of

the case In view of the fact that the judgment and decree dated


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">                                                         Page 20 of 21</span>
 26-04-2002 passed in Title Appeal No 2 / 1999 has already been set

aside by this court, it is axiomatic that the immoveable properties

of late Rasharam Borah would devolve upon his surviving legal heirs

as per law. Since the fact of amicable partition of the suit land

amongst the plaintiff Nos.1, 2 and the defendant No.2 remains

disputed and in view of the fact that the plaintiffs suit was not for

partition of the suit land hence, it will be open to the legal heirs of

Late Rashram Borah to institute appropriate proceeding for partition

and for declaration of separate possession in respect of the plot of

land in question. In the event such a proceeding is instituted by any

of the legal heirs of Late Rashram Borah, the same shall be

considered and decided on merits and in accordance with law.
