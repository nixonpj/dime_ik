                                 Criminal Miscellaneous No.28013 of 2012
                 ======================================================
                 Kamta Yadav , son of Late Nanhku Yadav, resident of Village- Baruha, P.S.
                 Bagengola, District- Buxar
                                                                      .... .... Petitioner/s

                 ======================================================
                 CORAM: HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE RAKESH KUMAR
                 ORAL ORDER</pre>
<p id="p_1">                                            -----------------
</p>
<p id="p_2">2   06-02-2013               Heard learned counsel for the petitioner and Sri

                  Satyendra Prasad, learned Addl. Public Prosecutor.

</p><p id="p_3">                             This is the third attempt for grant of bail to the

                  petitioner. On last occasion i.e. on 19.10.2011 while dismissing

                  the bail petition i.e. Cr.Misc.No.33099 of 2011, this Court had

                  directed the court below to conclude the trial within a period of

                  eight months from the date of receipt/production of a copy of

                  the order. At the time of rejection of the same, four prosecution

                  witnesses were examined. Learned counsel for the petitioner

                  submits that despite direction of this Court and best effort taken

                  by the court below, the prosecution is not producing witnesses

                  regularly and due to that reason till date only four witnesses

                  have been examined. Almost situation remains the same, which

                  was present at the time of rejection of the bail application of the

                  petitioner on the last occasion.
</p>
<p id="p_4">                             In this case, a supplementary affidavit has been filed
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1"> 2   Patna High Court Cr.Misc. No.28013 of 2012 (2) dt.06-02-2013</span>

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                             2/3</span>




               and along with supplementary affidavit, the petitioner has

               brought on record photo copy of certified copy of the ordersheet

               to show that the prosecution is not very serious to get the trial

               concluded within the time framed by this Court. He further

               submits that the petitioner is in custody since long. He has

               remained in custody for about four years and in the meanwhile

               number of co-accused have been granted bail by this Court. He

               has referred to some of the bail orders passed by this Court,

               which have been brought on record vide Annexures-5, 6 and 7

               to the petition.
</p>
<p id="p_5">                          In view of the fact that the petitioner is in custody for a

               long period and despite the direction of this Court, trial has not

               proceeded in expeditious manner, the Court is of the opinion

               that the petitioner cannot be detained in custody for an

               indefinite period. Accordingly, let the petitioner above named

               be released on bail on furnishing bail bond of Rs.10,000/-( ten

               thousand) with two sureties of the like amount each to the

               satisfaction of Sri D.K.Sinha, 1st Addl. Sessions Judge, Buxar in

               connection with S.Tr. No.126 of 2009 ( Bagengola P.S. Case

               no.17 of 2008) on conditions that (i) one of the bailors must be

               blood relation of the petitioner and (ii) during the trial, the

               petitioner shall remain physically present on each and every
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3"> 3       Patna High Court Cr.Misc. No.28013 of 2012 (2) dt.06-02-2013</span>

                   date and if on two successive dates he remains absent before

                   the trial court, his bail bond shall stand automatically cancelled.
