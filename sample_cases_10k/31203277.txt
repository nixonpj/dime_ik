                W.P.(C)No.23168 of 2014 U

              ----------------------------------------------

          Dated this the 7th day of October, 2014


                           JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">       Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and the

learned Standing Counsel for the respondents, apart from

perusing the record. Since the issue lies in a narrow

compass, this Court proposes to dispose of the writ petition

at the admission stage itself.
</p>
<p id="p_2">       2. Briefly stated, the petitioner having worked as

Regional   Audit     Officer,       on      attaining       the age of

superannuation retired from service on 31.07.2014. Despite

his numerous representations, so far, his retirement

benefits have not been settled and paid by the authorities.

Under those circumstances he has approached this Court.

</p><p id="p_3">       3. The learned counsel for the petitioner has

strenuously contended that after repeated representations,

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">WPC 23168/14                    2</span>


both oral and written, when the petitioner approached the

authorities enquiring why his terminal benefits had not

been settled so far, he was informed by the authorities that

the Non Liability Certificate for the period from 07.03.2005

to 31.10.2008 had not been issued by the department

concerned to process his pension papers further. On his

further enquiry, the petitioner has come to know that no

disciplinary proceedings of whatever nature has been

pending. The alleged cause for not issuing the Non Liability

Certificate is based on an issue concerning purchase of

certain UG cable material from a company at Chennai

against the additional purchase order dated 05.02.2007,

made by the then Executive Engineer of the Board.

</p><p id="p_4">       4. The learned counsel has contended that at the

relevant time, i.e., from the years 2005 to 2008, the

petitioner had been working as Senior Superintendent with

the responsibility of only verifying the bills. According to the

learned counsel, the very Executive Engineer, who raised

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">WPC 23168/14                 3</span>


the bill and got payment on the strength of the said bill,

allegedly without prior sanction, has later been duly

promoted and is said to be presently working as a Director

in the respondent Board.
</p>
<p id="p_5">       5. The learned counsel has also strenuously

contended that the petitioner had no role at all in raising

the bill and the subsequent payment; even otherwise, apart

from some initial correspondence on the issue, no

proceedings, either judicial or departmental, have been

initiated against the petitioner or even against the then

Executive Engineer, presently the Director. The learned

counsel has also drawn the attention of this Court to Rule 3

Part III Kerala Service Rules (KSR) to emphasise the time

limit that has been cast on the authority to initiate

disciplinary proceedings against any alleged misconduct on

the part of an employee. The learned counsel has placed

reliance on a judgment of a learned Division Bench in

<a href="/doc/188690/" id="a_1">Kerala State Electricity Board v. Kesavan</a> (2014 (3) KLT

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">WPC 23168/14                   4</span>


SN 57 (C.No.73)). Summing up his submissions, the learned

counsel has submitted that even going by the statement

filed by the respondent Board, it is difficult to discern any

justification for the denial of pensionary benefits to the

petitioner, despite his repeated representations to get what

is constitutionally and statutorily a protected right.

Accordingly, he urged this Court to allow the writ petition.

</p><p id="p_6">        6. Per contra, the learned Standing Counsel, in tune

with the pleadings in the statement filed by the third

respondent, has submitted that though there is not much

dispute that no proceedings, either judicial or disciplinary,

are pending against the petitioner, the fact, however,

remains that so far the Non Liability Certificate for the

period from 07.03.2005 to 31.10.2008 has not been

produced. With a particular reference to paragraph 8 of the

statement, the learned Standing Counsel has further

submitted that the petitioner, then being the Senior

Superintendent, ought to have properly scrutinised the bills

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">WPC 23168/14                   5</span>


raised by the then Executive Engineer and could have taken

immediate steps in that regard. In any event, the issue

concerning raising of the bill, which has been adverted to in

the submission of the learned counsel for the petitioner, has

not been closed, and as such, it is difficult to accede to the

request of the petitioner to pay his terminal benefits before

putting an end to the controversy of unauthorised payment

based on the bills referred to above.
</p>
<p id="p_7">       7. To begin with, it can be very clearly seen recorded

in the fourth paragraph of the statement filed by the third

respondent    that  no    proceedings,   either   judicial  or

disciplinary, are seen initiated against the petitioner as per

his service records. There is no gainsaying the fact that the

respondents, in the statement, have pleaded about a

particular departmental transaction between 2005 and

2008 concerning purchase of UG cable from a company at

Chennai against the additional purchase order dated

05.02.2007, made by the then Executive Engineer of the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">WPC 23168/14                    6</span>


Board. The entire issue revolves around the aspect of

effecting payment without getting sanction regarding re-

fixation of price of the said material. Be that as it may, it is

not in dispute that the petitioner does not have any direct

role either in raising the bill or in ensuring payment thereof

without getting sanction regarding re-fixation of price. The

then Executive Engineer is said to have already been

promoted and is presently working as a Director in the

Board. It is discernible from the record that there was some

initial correspondence departmentally, but it ended way

back in 2008.
</p>
<p id="p_8">       8. Given the importance of the issue that a retired

employee has been struggling to get his terminal benefits,

the right to which he is entitled, as has been reiterated by

this Court as well as by the Honourable Supreme Court, the

inaction on the part of the respondent Board in settling the

terminal dues of the petitioner cannot easily be brushed

aside. Even statutorily Rule 3 Part III KSR, especially sub-

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">WPC 23168/14                    7</span>


clause (2) thereof, mandates that no departmental

proceedings shall be initiated in respect of an event which

took place more than four years.
</p>
<p id="p_9">       9. In the first place, the respondents themselves have

placed on record that till this day no proceedings have been

initiated. Even the issue, which is said to have come in the

way of the petitioner not getting his Non Liability

Certificate, happened in the year 2008. The departmental

correspondence on the issue ceased by 04.09.2008. In

terms of Rule 3 Part III KSR, at this juncture, the

respondent    Board      cannot    initiate any  disciplinary

proceedings against an employee, assuming that there was

any lapse on his part while he had been discharging the

functions of a Senior Superintendent way back from 2005 to

2008. A learned Division Bench of this Court in Kesavan's

case (supra) has also categorically held that the retiral

benefit like gratuity, being a property as enshrined in

<a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_2">Article 300A</a> of the Constitution, cannot be deprived or

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">WPC 23168/14                  8</span>


withheld without any statutory prescription.

</p><p id="p_10">       10. In the facts and circumstances, this Court is of

the considered opinion that there is no justification of

whatever nature for the respondent to tarry on the issue of

settling the terminal benefits of the petitioner. Accordingly,

this Court directs the authorities to duly process the

application of the petitioner and settle all his terminal

benefits as expeditiously as possible, at any rate, within a

period of two months from the date of receipt of a copy of

this judgment.
</p>
<p id="p_11">       With the above direction, the writ petition is

disposed of. No order as to costs.
