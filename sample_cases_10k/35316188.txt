^For Respondents   :  Mr.J.Maria Roselene
                                        
:JUDGMENT       
</pre>        
<p id="p_1">        This Second Appeal has been preferred against the Judgment and Decree  
of the Principal District  Judge, Trichy in A.S.No.338 of 2004, dated
16.06.2003, confirming the judgment and decree made in O.S.No.340 of 1995 on 
the file of Principal District Munsif Court, Trichy.
</p>
<p id="p_2">        2. The brief facts of the plaintiff's case in O.S.No.340 of 1995 is
that the plaintiff joined the defendant's institution as a steno Typist cum
Clerk in the year 1980.  On her completion of probation, she  reported to
duty at the Secretariat Division at Chennai.  She gave a requisition  to
transfer her from Chennai  to Tiruchirappalli on account of fixing of her
marriage and as her would be was settled at Tiruchirapalli. Hence, she was
transferred to Tiruchirapalli as per Rule 90(g)(iii) of Tamilnadu Electricity
Board Service Regulations on her requisition.
</p>
<p id="p_3">        3. While she was working at Tiruchirappalli, after completion of 10
years of service, she was moved to Selection Grade.  Four years thereafter,
there was an objection from the  audit as per Ex.B.3 thr order permitting her
to move to the Selection Grade was  cancelled vide  Ex.A.7.  The service of
Steno Typists in the Secretariat Branch is not different  from the service in
the Mofussil.  The conditions of service, the rights and duties of the Steno
Typists in both the divisions are one and the same.  Hence the plaintiff
challenged the cancellation order Ex.A.7 before the  District Munsif Court,
Tiruchirapalli.
</p>        
<p id="p_4">        4. The case of the defendant is that the Civil Court has no
jurisdiction to entertain the claim of the plaintiff.  Orders of movement to
Selection Grade dated 19.9.1990  was issued to the plaintiff taking into
account of her service including the service rendered in the  Secretariat
Branch  and  that was objected by the Audit Authorities on the ground that
services rendered at Secretariat Branch should not be taken into account for
fixation of  seniority  as per the conditions for transfer stipulated by the
Board.  The same should not have been taken in to account for  movement to
Selection Grade.  The objection of the audit authorities was submitted to the
Chief Engineer and the  Chief  Engineer upheld the audit objection.
Therefore the orders issued  for movement to Selection Grade was cancelled.
</p>        
        
<p id="p_5">        5. The further contention of the defendants 1 to 3 are that the
Tamilnadu Electricity Board Service Regulation 90 (g)(a)(iii) and (h)(i) if
approved probationer is transferred permanently from one office in one
departmental unit to any office in another departmental unit, she has to
forgo her right to seniority and she has to take the rank last in the list of
probationers or approved probationers as the case may be.
</p>
<p id="p_6">        6. While giving transfer application,  plaintiff gave an undertaking
that (a) she will forego her right to seniority on the basis of  date of her
first appointment. (b) She will take the rank last in the list of probationer
as on date of her join in the  Tiruchirappalli Electricity Distribution
Circle and (c) She will forgo her transfer travelling allowance for the
transfer.  Therefore the plaintiff is estopped from contending otherwise.
Hence the order of cancellation of movement to  selection grade is in order
and therefore  the plaintiff has no cause to complain and  the case cannot be
prosecuted before the Civil Court and further the claim is also barred by
limitation.
</p>        
<p id="p_7">        7. Based on the pleadings of both the parties, the trial court has
framed as many as six issues. 
</p><p id="p_8">        '1/thjp jpUr;rpuhg;ggs;sp vyf;l;hprpl;o rp!;lk; bjw;fpy; gzpapy;

</p><p id="p_9">        8. The trial court accepting the contention of the plaintiff decreed
the suit.  Challenging the judgment and decree of the District Munsif Court,
the defendant preferred the appeal before the First Appellate Court.  The
First Appellate Court based on the pleadings and documentary evidence has
raised the following points for consideration.  
</p><p id="p_10">        '1. Whether the undertaking given by the        plaintiff that she would take
the last rank in        the place of joining would be binding upon      the
plaintiff?
</p><p id="p_11">        2. Whether the services rendered by the                 plaintiff at the office
of secretariat division         could be counted for moving to selection
        grade? 
</p><p id="p_12">3. Whether the civil court has got jurisdiction?
</p><p id="p_13">4. Whether the cancellation of orders moving the plaintiff to selection grade
was done after following the principles of natural justice?
</p><p id="p_14">5. Whether the plaintiff is entitled to the relief of declaration and
injunction?'

</p><p id="p_15">        9. Considering the issues framed before the  the trial Court  and also
the points taken for consideration before the First Appellate Court and the
pleadings of both sides , we observe that the plaintiff was appointed as
Steno Typist on 3.9.1980.  Her services  were regularised in the  year 1981
and on 15.2.1984, she applied for transfer, as per which, she was issued with
transfer orders on 25.6.1984. On  3.9.1990, she was allowed to move to the
Selection Grade post  with effect from 3.9.1990.  During the course of her
service at Tiruchirapalli she was transferred from  Tiruchirapalli
Electricity Systems Division to  General Construction Circle, (Central)
Thiruchirapalli.  Thereafter, by order dated  13.12.1995, the order
permitting her to move to selection grade was cancelled   by giving the
following reasons;
</p><p id="p_16">                ?The orders issued in this office above memo for the movement of
Selection Grade to Tmt.Niloufer Jahan, steno with effect from 03.09.90 FN, is
hereby cancelled, as her services from the date of joining in this Circle on
request transfer will be reckoned for movement to Selection grade as per the
Chief Engineer/Personnel's letter No.127220/ 1867/ OS(2) 94-F, dated 16/24-
12-94.
</p>
<p id="p_17">        10. The substantial question of law arises for consideration in this
appeal is as follows;
</p><p id="p_18">        1. Whether the civil court has jurisdiction to entertain the present
suit which relates to the service jurisprudence?
</p><p id="p_19">        2. When the plaintiff/respondent herself has voluntarily given an
undertaking which was marked as Ex.B6 that she will forgo her right to
seniority on the basis of date of her first appointment and she will take the
rank last in the list of probationer as on date of her joining in
Tiruchirapalli, whether the plaintiff/respondent is estopped from questioning
the same? 
</p><p id="p_20">        3.  Whether the lower appellate Court has erred in holding that the
service rendered in different branch of the same board is not a criteria  for
selection grade while computing the period of ten years from the date of
service is legally sustainable?
</p>
<p id="p_21">        11. The documents filed on the side of the appellant Electricity Board
dated 3.12.1979 as per proceedings in MS No.288 (Secretariat Branch) which 
deals with the creation of selection grade post on higher scale of pay is to
be considered.  The contents of the said proceedings is as follows;
</p><p id="p_22">        'Leave, other than the extra ordinary leave without pay and allowance
should be taken into account while computing  10 years period.  The period of
ten years  in a post will be reckoned from the date of regular appointment to
the post  but  will exclude the parties to revision.'
        
</p><p id="p_23">        12. The relevant condition in the suit proceedings is the  period of 10
years will be  reckoned from the date of  regular appointment to the post.
Admittedly the plaintiff was put into regular appointment to the post on
3.9.1980.  The plaintiff  joined  the defendant Board in 1980  and on
completion of service,  she reported to duty.
</p>
<p id="p_24">        13. Therefore the condition  as per Ex.A.7 that services of the
plaintiff would be counted from the defendant joining in the Construction
Circle will be reckoned for movement to selection grade cannot be correct.
The Audit Report Ex.B.3 raised the query that   whether the services rendered
in Secretariat Branch in the post of Steno Typist cannot be taken for the
purpose of seniority as well as movement to selection grade in the post of
Steno Typist in  Circle Office.  The above said both posts  belong to
different services.
</p>
<p id="p_25">         14. Ex.B.4 is the letter from Superintending Engineer, General
Construction Circle, Central, Post Box No.820, Mannarpuram, Trichy-20 to the
Chief Engineer/Personnel, Electricity Avenue, Annasalai, Madras-2 expressing
opinion that  the order of movement to selection grade issued to the
plaintiff reckoning from the period of service of the Secretariat Branch is
in order and no revision is necessary.  But in Ex.B.5, the Chief Engineer has
replied that  the audit objection is  self explanatory and it is in  order.
So  for movement to Selection Grade, the date of  regular appointment to the
post  alone is the criteria and the services rendered  in the different
Branch of the same  Board is not the criteria.
</p>
<p id="p_26">        15. The Tamilnadu Electricity Board has effected certain amendments to
Tamilnadu Electricity Board Service Regulations.  The  regulation No. 90,
sub-regulation (g)  and (h)  are omitted.  This is numbered as amendment
No.9/1985.  The Rules governing the transfers in the year 1994 is covered by
Rule 19(g)(iii) of the Tamilnadu Electricity Board Services Regulations and
rule 90(h) deals with mutual transfer and   90(g)  deals with transfer of
administrative necessity.
</p>        
<p id="p_27">        16. It does not call for any undertaking as contemplated under clause
90(h)(i). The question of giving an  undertaking agreeing to forgo the
seniority  and to take the seniority  last in the list will arise in the case
of mutual transfers..
</p>
<p id="p_28">        17. The question of taking or necessity of  such an undertaking for
transfers which  are mutual transfers is not contemplated in the  rule
itself.  The relevant rule 90(g)(iii) in its proviso states that a transfer
under clause (iii) shall  be made only with the consent of the Board.  It is
not contemplated that the Board has the authority to insist upon undertaking
of any such sort, nor the rule contemplate that the Board has the authority
to insist upon such an  such an undertaking while entertaining transfer
application,  the authorities concerned cannot insist upon  any such
undertaking.   Any undertaking given by the plaintiff which is not at all
contemplated by the rules has no legal validity and it is void.
</p>
<p id="p_29">        18. Hence the  only undertaking that is expected is that  the person
seeking transfer shall forgo transfer travelling allowance for the above
transfer.  But the  cancellation order  says that it is in accordance with
law rules and regulations.
</p>
<p id="p_30">        19. Ex.A.7 is dated 13.2.1995.  The main arguments  advanced by the 
respondent/plaintiff is that the order  cancelling the move to the selection
grade is illegal by quoting  the following case laws;
</p>
<p id="p_31">        (i)  in 2004(5) CTC, 108 (R. Sulochana Devi Vs. D.M. Sujatha and
others), wherein it is held as follows;
</p><p id="p_32">        ?Administrative law-Principles of Natural Justice ? Order passed
without notice to party is not an order passed in accordance with law ? Such
order is nullity and need not be challenged in Court of law.?
</p><p id="p_33">        (ii) 1990(1) M.L.J., 320 (N.G. Subrmanian Vs. The  District Educational
Officer, Tirupattur and others).
</p><p id="p_34">        (iii) AIR 1974 Supreme Court, 1889 (Divisional Superintendent, Eastern
Railway, Dinapur Vs. L.N.Kashri and others).
</p>        
<p id="p_35">        20. It is argued by the respondent that  all the three decisions
arrived in the case categories  are limited to the case which go to show that
any order  passed, which takes away the rights  already given to a party is
illegal.  In this case, the orders of cancellation has been passed after a
lapse of  4 years  after conferment of selection grade.  Whereas,  the
plaintiff was not given an opportunity to explain as to why the Selection
Grade already conferred upon her should not be cancelled.  Here the
respondent was not given a chance of expressing her explanation after she
was served with a show cause notice.  Whereas the respondent/plaintiff is
totally deprived of her right to make her explanation. Hence the order  lacks
the fundamental principle of natural justice ie., the respondent/plaintiff is
totally denied of her right to know the reason for the cancellation of
movement and  expressed her explanation for the same since the order was 
passed after  four years of the  confirmation of selection grade.
</p>        
<p id="p_36">        21. In view of the argument advanced by the respondent/plaintiff and
also in view of the decisions arrived in he above cases, the plaintiff lacks
the opportunity of  giving her explanation for such cancellation of the
order, whereas she is deprived of the same by  not issuing any show cause
notice to the respondent/plaintiff.  Hence the impugned order issued by the
respondents  is in  violation of principles of natural justice and hence it
is hereby set aside.
</p>        
<p id="p_37">        22. Regarding the jurisdiction of the civil Court in  a case reported
in 1995 T.L.N.J.45 (Tamil Nadu Cement corporation Limited, Ariyalur Vs.
Jabamalai and others),  wherein an employee was suspended who was seeking to   
have his   service  conditions to be declared by a Civil Court and his plea
was negatived on the plea of lack of jurisdiction.  But in this case, the
order  which was passed by the Chief Engineer, Electricity  itself has no
legal existence and that the  grievance  of the respondent/plaintiff is that
the order should be declared as a void because of lacking of natural justice
and the same was issued by the authority who was vested with the power.
</p>
<p id="p_38">        23. On the side of the respondent, it is also argued that in <a href="/doc/1757891/" id="a_1">Dhulebhai
and another vs. State of Madhya Pradesh and another</a>  which deals with the
jurisdiction of the Civil Court and the decision arrived in that case is that
the Civil Court can declare the act of an authority as illegal ad void, in
case there is violation of fundamental principles of natural justice.  Hence,
in this case, the  prime relief sought  by the  plaintiff is that the
cancellation order passed by the Chief Engineer has to be declared as void
and on perusal of the GO and the service regulations of Tamil Nadu
Electricity Board, the order is lacking  natural justice, hence that is
found to be one which is lacking the fundamental principles  has been
declared as void .
</p>        
<p id="p_39">        24. It is to be noted that just because the plaintiff has given an
undertaking, she is not  in any way binding by such undertaking  when the
circular is very clear.
</p>
<p id="p_40">        25.  In that circumstances, the Civil Court has jurisdiction to declare
that the act of the Chief Engineer who is the  authority passed the said
order.  Hence considering the facts of the case and the GO and the order
passed by the appellant and also the grievance of the respondent, the
judgment and decree passed by the First Appellate Court  is confirmed by
saying hat  the order of the appellant is void and regarding the
jurisdiction also the Sub Court has jurisdiction to try the suit and hence
the First Appellate Court findings which confirms that the decree and
judgment of the trial court does not require any interference and the same is
hereby confirmed and the Second Appeal is dismissed and the substantial 
question of law are answered accordingly.
</p>
<p id="p_41">        26. In the result, the  Second Appeal is  dismissed by confirming the
decree and judgment of the First Appellate Court, confirming the  judgment
and decree of the trial Court.   No costs.
