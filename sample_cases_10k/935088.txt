<p id="p_1">      This appeal is preferred against the award of the Motor

Accidents Claims Tribunal, Perumbavoor in O.P.(MV)309/06.

It is the case of the claimant that while he was riding as a

pillion rider in a motorcycle and when it reached the place of

accident, a jeep from the opposite direction came in a rash

and negligent manner and hit against it resulting in injuries

to him. But the the Tribunal found it otherwise and held that

the accident had taken place on account of the negligence of

the rider of the bike and therefore dismissed the claim

petition. It is against that decision the claimant has come up

in appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_2">      2.    Heard the counsel for all. The facts of the case

would reveal that the claimant was travelling as a pillion

rider and when it reached the place of accident there was a

collision between the motorcycle and the jeep. The Tribunal

found that the claimant's motor bike was proceeding from

M.A.C.A. 20 OF 2010
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                -:2:-</span>

west to east and its correct side was northern side. The road

was having a width of 10 mtrs. and the accident had taken

place about 2.15 mtrs. north of the southern tarred end.

Therefore the Tribunal came to the conclusion that the

motorcyclist had gone to the wrong side and therefore

negligence can be attributed on the motorcyclist. The police

after investigation had filed a charge against the jeep driver.

It can also be seen from the scene mahazar itself that the

road is having a straight vision of two hundred mts. Further

it has always to be remembered that when an accident is

about to take place the foremost thing in the mind of the

persons would be to avert the accident and in the process

they may swerve the vehicle one way or other.         Learned

counsel for the appellant submits before me that the

motorcyclist was going to the other side for the purpose of

turning and it was in that process the accident took place.

But unfortunately I do not find any witnesses or even the

claimant being examined in the case to prove the factum of

negligence.     So in that aspect the matter requires

M.A.C.A. 20 OF 2010
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                               -:3:-</span>

reconsideration.  Learned counsel for the appellant would

contend that he may be permitted to implead the rider of the

motorcycle as well as the insurance company and owner. It

can also be permitted to do justice to the claimant.

</p><p id="p_3">     Therefore the award under challenge is set aside

making it clear that I am not expressing anything on merits

regarding the negligence and permit the parties to adduce

both documentary as well as oral evidence in support of their

respective contentions. I also permit the claimant to implead

the rider, owner and insurer of the motorcycle also in the

party array and the matter be disposed of after hearing all

concerned. Parties are directed to appear before the Tribunal

on 16.8.2000.
