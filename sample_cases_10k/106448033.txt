<p id="p_1">3   21-01-2019                 Heard learned counsel for the petitioner and learned APP
                   for the State.
</p><p id="p_2">                               2. The petitioner apprehends his arrest for the offences
                   alleged under Section 30(a) of the Bihar Excise and <a href="/doc/790355/" id="a_1">Prohibition Act</a>,
                   2016 (hereinafter referred to as 'the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_2">Excise Act</a>, 2016') registered in
                   connection with Buxar (Industrial Area) P.S. Case No. 151 of 2/2018.
</p><p id="p_3">                               3. At the very outset, this Court takes note of an order
                   passed by a co-ordinate Bench of this Court in Ashok Sahani Vs. The
                   State of Bihar, 2017(3) PLJR 632. After a detailed deliberation over
                   the effect of <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_3">Section 76(2)</a> of the Excise Act, 2016, it was
                   categorically opined in paragraph-14 that the privilege of pre-arrest
                   bail under <a href="/doc/1783708/" id="a_4">Section 438</a> of the Cr. P.C. is not available to person
                   accused of having committed an offence under the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_5">Excise Act</a>, 2016.
                   Certain guidelines (not exhaustive) were also laid out in paragraph-
                   30, indicating circumstances where bail should normally be granted
                   to the accused persons on their production by the police or on their
                   surrender. The Registrar General was also directed to ensure that
                   stamp reporters would not place applications filed under <a href="/doc/1783708/" id="a_6">Section 438</a>
                   of the Cr. P.C. arising out of the cases under the Excise, Act, 2016
 Patna High Court Cr.Misc. No.73517 of 2018(3) dt.21-01-2019
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                             2/3</span>




          before the Bench as defect free cases henceforth.
</p><p id="p_4">                       4. The aforesaid order in Ashok Sahani's case (supra)
          came to be considered of another co-ordinate Bench of this Court
          passed in Cr. Misc. No. 21578 of 2017 (Manish Kumar @ Lokesh
          Kumar Vs. The State of Bihar) which, by order dated 10.08.2017,
          held the earlier judgment per incuriam, apart from holding the
          provisions of <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_7">Section 76(2)</a> of the Excise Act, 2016 as void in view
          of <a href="/doc/1930681/" id="a_8">Article 254</a> of the Constitution of India. The question whether the
          Registry could be restrained from entertaining anticipatory bail
          petitions as directed in Ashok Sahani's case (supra), was referred to a
          larger Bench.
</p><p id="p_5">                       5. By another judgment dated 03.10.2017 passed by a
          third co-ordinate Bench of this Court in Cr. Misc. No. 42985 of 2017
          (Barun Kumar Vs. The State of Bihar), the issue relating to
          maintainability of anticipatory bail petitions in respect of offences
          under the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_9">Excise Act</a>, 2016 came to be considered yet again. The
          decision in Manish Kumar's case (supra) was found to have been
          passed in oversight of the relevant provisions of the Constitution of
          India as well as <a href="/doc/1329373/" id="a_10">Section 4</a> of the Cr. P.C. which could not be placed
          before it. As such the decision in Ashok Sahani's case (supra) was
          held to be binding on a co-ordinate Bench wherein it had been held
          that an anticipatory bail petition under <a href="/doc/1783708/" id="a_11">Section 438</a> of the Cr. P.C.
          cannot be maintained in cases of offences arising out of the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_12">Excise
          Act</a>, 2016.
</p><p id="p_6">                       6. The reference to the Larger Bench in Cr. Misc. No.
          21578 of 2017 (Manish Kumar @ Lokesh Kumar Vs. The State of
          Bihar) was answered by the Division Bench in its order dated
          06.11.2017, opining that the Registry could not be restrained from
          entertaining anticipatory bail petition in compliance of the order
          passed in Ashok Sahani's case (supra). However, in paragraph-9 of
          the said order, it was specifically stated that the aspect of the
          vires/validity/repugnancy of <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_13">Section 76(2)</a> was not being considered
           Patna High Court Cr.Misc. No.73517 of 2018(3) dt.21-01-2019
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                                       3/3</span>




                    as the same was already sub-judice before the Apex Court. The
                    principles noticed by an earlier Division Bench in             Bisheshwar
                    Mishra Vs. The State of Bihar, 2016 (4) PLJR 1058 in the context of
                    a similar bar to grant of anticipatory bail under the provisions of
                    SC/<a href="/doc/53524/" id="a_14">ST Act</a> in the light of the Apex Court's decision in Vilas
                    Pandurang Pawar Vs. State of Maharashtra, (2012) 8 SCC 795 were
                    taken note of in paragraph-13, which cast a duty upon the Court
                    considering the pre-arrest bail of an accused, to look into the
                    allegations made in the F.I.R./complaint to find out whether
                    ingredients of the offence under the SC/<a href="/doc/53524/" id="a_15">ST Act</a> were prima facie
                    made out or not before exercising its judicial discretion under <a href="/doc/1783708/" id="a_16">Section
                    438</a> of the Cr. P.C. It was therefore held that the law regarding
                    consideration of an application under <a href="/doc/1783708/" id="a_17">Section 438</a> of the Cr. P.C. for
                    grant of pre-arrest bail to the accused under an Act where there is a
                    bar to grant of anticipatory bail, had been settled as such.
</p><p id="p_7">                                 7. In view of the decision of this Court in Ashok Sahani's
                    case (supra) as reiterated in Barun Kumar's case (supra), therefore
                    this Court is constrained to hold that the anticipatory bail petition in
                    respect of offences alleged against the petitioner under the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_18">Excise
                    Act</a>, 2016 is not maintainable.
</p><p id="p_8">                                 8. Learned counsel for the petitioner has also not been
                    able to satisfy this Court that looking to the allegations made in the
                    F.I.R., the ingredients of the offences alleged against the petitioner
                    have not been made out.
</p><p id="p_9">                                 9.    The anticipatory bail petition accordingly stands
                    dismissed.
