present petitions are as under :
</p>
<p id="p_10">

</p><p id="p_11">6.       In Writ Petition No. 2300 of 2018, it is the case of the petitioner

that the petitioner is original applicant and respondent No.1 is original

opponent.         The petitioner and respondent No.1 are wife and

husband. They got married on 20.05.1997 at Solapur, and all the

marriage expenses were incurred by the petitioner.                Respondent

No.1 is working as a teacher in Zilla Parishad School at Vadibangla,

Taluka- Malshiras, District -Solapur and getting salary of Rs. 50,000/-

p.m. in Zilla Parishad School at Solapur. Respondent No.1 is having

a big house consists of four rooms, which is situated at Gat No.

1466/A at Village Mahalunga, Taluka-Malshiras, District-Solapur and

also having an agricultural land in the name of his father. It is further

case of the petitioner that after marriage, for quite some time the

relations with respondent No.1 were cordial, but later on respondent

No.1 started quarreling for one or other reason with her, as well as

with her father-in-law and mother-in-law. The parents of the petitioner

resolved the dispute between them through mediator. However, all

the efforts of the petitioner were in vain and respondent No.1,


Trupti                                                                    3/17

unnecessarily harassed the petitioner. During the existence of first

marriage, respondent No.1 contracted second marriage with one

Sadhana in the year 2013 and out of that wedlock, they have one

son.      Thereafter, respondent No.1 started giving threats to the

petitioner and therefore, the petitioner had no any option but to leave

the matrimonial house, and after leaving the matrimonial house, she

started residing with her parents. Therefore, the petitioner has filed

an application under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_1">section 125</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure

(for short, "the <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_2">Cr.P.C</a>.") before the learned Judicial Magistrate First

Class, Solapur in Criminal Miscellaneous Application No. 943 of 2012

and after hearing both the sides, the learned Magistrate was pleased

to pass an order thereby granting maintenance amount of Rs.5,000/-

p.m. and Rs.1,000/- towards cost on 29.07.2013.



</p><p id="p_12">7.       It is further the case of the petitioner that, respondent No.1 has

not challenged the order dated 29.07.2013 passed by learned IXth

Judicial Magistrate First Class, Solapur in Criminal Miscellaneous

Application No. 943 of 2012 and therefore, the said order attained

finality, and hence, as respondent No.1 is not paying an amount of

maintenance in compliance with order passed by the learned

Application No. 1677 of 2016 for execution of order dated 29.07.2013

passed by learned IXth Judicial Magistrate First Class, Solapur in

Criminal Miscellaneous Application No.943 of 2012. During pendency

of the said Application, respondent No.1 preferred an Application

below exhibit 6 thereby stating that, the petitioner cannot recover

maintenance amount in both the proceedings i.e., the Application

filed under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_3">section 125</a> of the Cr.P.C. and in the Application filed

the said Application, and after hearing both the parties, learned

Sessions Court, Solapur praying therein to direct respondent No.1 to

pay Rs. 50,000/- towards maintenance. However, it appears that the

Appellate Court did not cause interference in the order passed by the

trial Court and hence, the order passed by the learned Magistrate

attained finality.      As respondent No.1 was not paying amount of

maintenance as directed by the learned Magistrate, the petitioner

preferred Criminal Miscellaneous Application No. 1678 of 2016 for

execution of order dated 22.12.2015 passed by learned IXth Judicial

Magistrate First Class, Solapur in Criminal Miscellaneous Application

No. 1983 of 2014.               During pendency of the said Application,

aggrieved by the order dated 11.08.2017 passed by learned Judicial

Magistrate First Class, Solapur in Criminal Miscellaneous Application

No. 1678 of 2016 below exhibit 6 preferred Criminal Revision

Application No. 115 of 2017 before the Sessions Court, Solapur. The

learned Sessions Judge, Solapur after hearing both the sides was

pleased to allow the Revision Application preferred by respondent

No.1 by its judgment and order dated 09.04.2018. Hence, these

petitions.
</p>
<p id="p_19">

</p><p id="p_20">12.      Learned Counsel appearing for the petitioner submits that the

learned Judge did not appreciate and accepted the contention of the

petitioner that, the proceedings under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_10">section 125</a> of the Cr.P.C. and

proceedings under the D.V.Act, are independent proceedings and

therefore, both the orders of maintenance will stand independently

and hence, the petitioner is entitled to receive maintenance in both

the proceedings from respondent No.1. He further submits that

learned Judge has not properly considered purport and scope of

<a href="/doc/485875/" id="a_11">section 20</a> (1) (d) of the <a href="/doc/542601/" id="a_12">D.V. Act</a>, and that provisions of the said Act

shall be in addition to and not in derogation of the provisions of any

other law for the time being in force.      He further submits that the

learned Judge ought to have considered the fact that, an amount of

maintenance awarded under the D.V. Act, cannot be considered an

amount of maintenance under section 125 of the Cr.P.C.



</p><p id="p_21">13.      Learned Counsel further submits that, respondent No.1 has not

challenged the order passed by the learned Magistrate on the

application preferred by the petitioner under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_13">section 125</a> of the

Cr.P.C. Respondent No.1 is working as a teacher in Solapur Zilla

Parishad School and getting salary of Rs. 60,000/- p.m. and,

therefore, respondent No.1 can easily pay Rs. 5,000/- p.m. towards

maintenance. He further submits that, during existence of first

marriage with the petitioner, in the year 2013, respondent No.1

illegally contracted second marriage with one Sadhana, and out of

said wedlock, they have one son.           He further submits that, the

petitioner is residing with her parents and she has no other source of

income except an amount received towards maintenance. He further

submits that, the learned Sessions Judge erroneously exercised

in the said proceedings will stand independently. It would be apt to

reproduce paragraph Nos. 7 and 8 of the said judgment, which reads

as under :

         which was of an interim nature and taking into consideration that

         <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_20">Section 125</a> of Cr.P.C. only from the date of the order. It has to be
         held that this order under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_21">Section 125</a> of Cr.P.C. stands
         independently and in addition to the maintenance awarded under
         the <a href="/doc/542601/" id="a_22">Domestic Violence Act</a>.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">         8. It has to be held so in view of <a href="/doc/485875/" id="a_23">Section 20</a> (1) (d) of the
         <a href="/doc/542601/" id="a_24">Domestic Violence Act</a>, which clearly provides that, 'in proceedings

         maintenance under <a href="/doc/542601/" id="a_26">D.V. Act</a> is in addition to an order of
         maintenance under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_27">Section 125</a> of Cr.P.C. or any other law for the
         time being in force. <a href="/doc/417845/" id="a_28">Section 36</a> of the D.V. Act makes the things
