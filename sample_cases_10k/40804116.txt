<p id="p_1">            One of the grievance in this writ petition raised by the

petitioner is that under the Punjab Affiliated Colleges (Security of

Service) Amendment Act, 2007, no remedy to appeal before the

Educational Tribunal constituted under Section 7(A) of the Punjab

Privately Managed Recognized Schools Employees (Security of Service)

Act, 1979 has been provided.

counsel for the parties, this court passed the following order on

28.1.2013:-

<blockquote id="blockquote_1">                           "Reply on behalf of respondent No. 3-CBSE

                    handed over in Court is taken on record.

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">                           The grievance made in this petition is that the

                    employees of the unaided/affiliated colleges have not

                    been    provided    remedy    of    appeal   before   the

                    Educational Tribunal constituted under the Punjab

                    Affiliated Colleges (Security of Service) Amendment

                    Act, 2007. It is the submission of the petitioner that

                    the judgment of Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/8064/" id="a_1">TMA PAI

                    Foundation and others vs. State of Karnataka and

                    others</a>, 2008 (8) SCC 481 is not being followed in

                    letter and spirit. This is the short question on which

                    notice of motion was issued on 8.11.2013. However,

                    till date, no reply is filed by the respondent-State.

                    Learned Addl. A.G., Punjab submits that some time be

                    given to him to seek instructions as to whether the

                    respondents would be willing to make suitable

                    amendment(s) in the legislation."</blockquote><p id="p_3">

</p><p id="p_4">              In deference thereto, it is stated by learned State counsel that

a decision in principle to carry out suitable amendment in the statute has

been taken whereby the teachers/employees working against un-aided

posts shall also have an appellate avenue before the Educational Tribunal.

He submits that the formal notification is likely to be issued within one

month.
</p>
<p id="p_5">            In view of the above-stated events which have taken place

after passing of the above-reproduced order by this Court, we dispose of

this writ petition with a direction to the State of Punjab to issue a formal

notification by 30.6.2013. Needless to say that no sooner the remedy to

appeal becomes available, the petitioner shall be entitled to submit her

appeal before the Educational Tribunal, which shall then be decided in

accordance with law.
