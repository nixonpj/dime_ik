                  (RAMESH PATEL Vs RAMDAS @ KAMLESH PATEL)


13-04-2017

     Shri Dinesh Upadhyay, learned counsel for the petitioner.
     Shri M.K. Mishra, learned counsel for the respondent no.1.</pre>
<p id="p_1">     Shri Puneet Shroti, learned PL for the respondent nos. 2 and 3.
     Shri S.D. Gupta, learned counsel for the respondent no.4.
     During course of the arguments, counsel for the petitioner
submits that initially the election petition was being tried by SDO,
Lavkush Nagar under the provisions of Rule 78 of Madhya Pradesh
Farmers Organisation Election Rules, 1999. Since the SDO Lavkush
Nagar expressed his personal difficulty to hear the election petition on
the ground that he had been Presiding Officer at election, the matter
was transferred before the Collector, Chhatarpur. From order sheet
dated 20/11/2015 it is seen that the Collector agreed with the reports
submitted by SDO, Lavkush Nagar and transferred the said matter to
the SDO, Rajnagar directing him to issue notice to the parties and
thereafter, to decide the case on 28/12/2015. It is mentioned in the
order sheet by the SDO, Rajnagar that the service of notice is awaited
on the respondent/present petitioner.
</p><p id="p_2">       The record was summoned by this Court.
</p><p id="p_3">       On perusal of the record it is seen that there is a letter dated
9/02/2016 issued by the SDO, Rajnagar to Tahsildar, Lavkush Nagar
directing him to serve the notice on the respondent in the election
petition/present petitioner. Thereafter, there is no record available that
whether the notice was served to the present petitioner or not.
</p><p id="p_4">       In para 6.7 there is specific averment that after the transfer of the
case by the Collector, notice was not served on the petitioner and there
is no endorsement of service of notice by him. Though in the order
 sheet on 24/04/2016 there is signature of the petitioner but the same is
disputed by counsel for the petitioner during course of the arguments.
</p><p id="p_5">      In view of the aforesaid facts, the counsel for the State is
directed to call for the record from the Office of the SDO, Rajnagar,
District Chhatarpur and also from Tahsildar, Lavkush Nagar, District
Chhatarpur in pursuant to the letter dated 9/02/2016 about the service
of notice on the petitioner.
</p><p id="p_6">      Let the necessary record be produced on 27/04/2017.
      A copy of this order be supplied to counsel for the State to
ensure that relevant record is made available on the next date.
</p><p id="p_7">      The record produced by the State is returned to the counsel for
the State who will retain the same.
</p><p id="p_8">       List on 27/04/2017.
</p><p id="p_9">       Interim order passed on earlier occasion shall remain continued
till next date of hearing.
</p>
<p id="p_10">                                           (VIJAY KUMAR SHUKLA)
                                                   JUDGE
