                             JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">      The insurer in a proceedings for compensation before the

Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal has come up in this appeal

challenging the award granting compensation to the claimant in the

proceedings.
</p>
<p id="p_2">      2. Respondents 1 to 3 filed the application for compensation

invoking <a href="/doc/22871263/" id="a_1">Section 163A</a> of the Motor Vehicles Act, alleging that their

predecessor Binu Korah sustained fatal injuries in an accident while

riding a motor cycle.     According to them, he succumbed to the

injuries sustained, on 25.6.2004. The case in the application was

that the fourth respondent who is the owner of the vehicle and the

appellant who is the insurer of the vehicle, are liable to compensate

them for the death of the deceased.
</p>
<p id="p_3">      3. The fourth respondent remained ex parte. The appellant

contested the application by filing written statement contending

inter alia that since the accident occurred on account of the

capsizing of the vehicle driven by the predecessor of the claimants

himself, the application is not maintainable.

M.A.C.A.No.518 of 2011
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                    2</span>

</p><p id="p_4">      4. The Tribunal, on an appraisal of the materials on record,

found that the claimants are entitled to compensation and

accordingly, passed an award permitting the second respondent to

recover a sum of Rs.79,500/- from the appellant by way of

compensation. The appellant is aggrieved by the said award and

hence this appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_5">      5.  Even though notice was taken out to the respondents,

there is no appearance for them.
</p>
<p id="p_6">      6. Heard the learned counsel for the appellant.

</p><p id="p_7">      7. The learned counsel for the appellant contended that the

provision in <a href="/doc/22871263/" id="a_2">Section 163A</a> of the Act is a provision intended to the

benefit of third parties and in so far as the predecessor of the

claimants who himself was driving the vehicle with the permission of

its owner can be treated only as the owner of the vehicle, the

application for compensation is not maintainable, for, there is no

tort feasor involved. The learned counsel for the appellant has also

relied on the decisions of this Court in <a href="/doc/1392571/" id="a_3">United India Insurance

Co. Ltd. v. Vijayarajan</a> [2009 (3) KLT 269] and <a href="/doc/174574669/" id="a_4">National

Insurance Company Ltd. v. Sajitha Beegom N. and Others</a>

[2012 (3) KHC 527], in support of his contention. <a href="/doc/1392571/" id="a_5">United India

Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Vijayarajan</a> (supra) is a decision rendered

on identical facts. In the said case also, the legal representatives of

M.A.C.A.No.518 of 2011
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                       3</span>

the person who was riding the motor cycle involved in the accident

filed the application for compensation invoking <a href="/doc/22871263/" id="a_6">Section 163A</a> of the

Act for the death of their predecessor. In the said case, this Court

held that a person who is using a vehicle with the permission of its

owner is not entitled to claim compensation for the injuries

sustained by him      under <a href="/doc/22871263/" id="a_7">Section 163A</a> of the Act. The relevant

portion of the said judgment reads thus :
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">                   "2. We heard learned counsel for the appellant

            Sri.A.R.George as also learned counsel for the respondents

            Sri.Jimmy George. Learned counsel for the appellant would

            submit that being an application under S.163A of the Motor

            Vehicles Act it is not open to the Tribunal to award

            compensation to the claimants in a case where the deceased

            had admittedly borrowed the vehicle from its owner-driver and

            caused the accident which ultimately culminated in his death.

            In support of this plea, he relied on the decision of the Apex

            Court in Civil Appeal Nos.3538/09 and 3540/09. Therein, the

            Apex Court was considering a case where the deceased was

            driving a motor cycle which he borrowed from its real owner

            and it was a case that when it was proceeding on the road, a

            bullock cart proceeding ahead of the said motor cycle stopped

            suddenly and consequently the deceased dashed against it

            sustaining fatal injuries and dying on the way to the hospital. It

            is apposite to refer paragraphs 16, 17, 18, 19 and 20. They

            read as follows:

                   formula basis by mandating that the owner of a motor

                   vehicle or the authorised insurer would be liable to pay

                   compensation, as indicated in the Second Schedule in

                   the case of death or permanent disablement due to

                   accident arising out of the use of the motor vehicle, to

                   the legal heirs or the victim, as the case may be in a

                   claim made under sub-s. (1) of S.163A of the M.V.A. In

                   order to prove a claim of this nature the claimant would

                   not be required to plead or establish that the death or

                   permanent disablement in respect of which the claim

                   has been made was due to any wrongful act or neglect

                   or default of the owner of the vehicle concerned.


</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_6">                       17. However, in the facts of the present case, it was

                   forcefully argued by the counsel appearing for the

                   respondent that the claimants are not the 'third party',

                   and therefore, they are not entitled to claim any benefit

                   under S.163A of the M.V.A. In support of the said

                   contention, the counsel relied on the decision of this

                   Court in the case of <a href="/doc/1705954/" id="a_8">Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Rajni

                   Devi</a> (2008 (4) KLT 145 (SC) = (2008) 5 SCC 736) and

                   S.B.Sinha is a party, it has been categorically held that

                   in a case where third party is involved, the liability of

                   the insurance company would be unlimited. It was also

                   held in the said decision that where, however,

                   compensation is claimed for the death of the owner or

M.A.C.A.No.518 of 2011
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                       5</span>

                   another passenger of the vehicle, the contract of

                   insurance being governed by the contract qua contract,

                   the claim of the claimant against the insurance company

                   would dependupon the terms thereof. It was held in the

                   said decision that S.163A of the M.V.A cannot be said to

                   have any application in respect of an accident wherein

                   the owner of the motor vehicle himself is involved. The

                   decision further held that the question is no longer res

                   integra. The liability under S.163A of the M.V.A. is on

                   the owner of the vehicle. So a person cannot be both, a

                   claimant as also a recipient, with respect to claim.

                   Therefore, the heirs of the deceased could not have

                   maintained a claim in terms of S.163A of the M.V.A. In

                   our considered opinion, the ratio of the aforesaid

                   decision is clearly applicable to the facts of the present

                   case. In the present case, the deceased was not the

                   owner of the motorbike in question. He borrowed the

                   said motorbike from its real owner. The deceased cannot

                   be held to be employee of the owner of the motorbike

                   although he was authorised to drive the said vehicle by

                   its owner, and therefore, he would step into the shoes of

                   the owner of the motorbike.
</p>
<p id="p_10">
</p><p id="p_11">                      19. We have already extracted S.163A of the M.V.A.

                   hereinbefore. A bare perusal of the said provision would

                   make it explicitly clear that persons like the deceased in

                   the present case would step into the shoes of the owner

                   of the vehicle. In a case wherein the victim died or

                   where he was permanently disabled due to an accident

                   arising out of the aforesaid motor vehicle in that event

                   the liability to make payment of the compensation is on

                   the insurance company or the owner, as the case may

                   be as provided under S.163A. But if it is proved that the

M.A.C.A.No.518 of 2011
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                      6</span>

                   driver is the owner of the motor vehicle, in that case the

                   owner could not himself be a recipient of compensation

                   as the liability to pay the same is on him. This

                   proposition is absolutely clear on a reading of S.163A of

                   the M.V.A. Accordingly, the legal representatives of the

                   deceased who have stepped into the shoes of the owner

                   of  the    motor   vehicle   could   not   have   claimed

                   compensation under S.163A of the M.V.A.
</p>
<p id="p_12">
</p><p id="p_13">                        20. When we apply the said principle into the facts

                   of the present case we are of the view that the

                   claimants were not entitled to claim compensation under

                   S.163A of the M.V.A. and to that extent the High Court

                   was justified in coming to the conclusion that the said

                   provision   is   not   applicable   to  the    facts  and

                   circumstances of the present case. However, the

                   question remains as to whether an application for

                   demand of compensation could have been made by the

                   legal representatives of the deceased as provided in

                   S.166 of the M.V.A. The said provision specifically

                   provides that an application for compensation arising

                   out of an accident of the nature specified in sub-s. (1) of

                   S.165 may be made by the person who has sustained

                   the injury; or by the owner of the property; or where

                   death has resulted from the accident, by all or any of

                   the legal representatives of the deceased; or by any

                   agent duly authorised by the person injured or all or any

                   of the legal representatives of the deceased, as the case

                   may be. When an application of the aforesaid nature

                   claiming compensation under the provisions of S.166 is

                   received, the Tribunal is required to hold an enquiry into

                   the claim and then proceed to make an award which,

                   however, would be subject to the provisions of S.162,

M.A.C.A.No.518 of 2011
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                       7</span>

                    by determining the amount of compensation, which is

                    found to be just. Person or persons who made claim for

                    compensation would thereafter be paid such amount.

                    When such a claim is made by the legal representatives

                    of the deceased, it has to be proved that the deceased

                    was not himself responsible for the accident by his rash

                    and negligent driving. It would also be necessary to

                    prove that the deceased would be covered under the

                    policy so as to make the insurance company liable to

                    make the payment to the heirs."

             dictum of this Court laid down by the Full Bench but being the

             decision of the Apex Court we are bound to follow the Apex

             Court by <a href="/doc/882644/" id="a_10">Art.141</a> of the constitution. Here also like in the facts

             of the case before the Apex Court, the deceased was not a

             registered owner of the vehicle. He was using the motor cycle

             with the permission of its owner. He dashed against an electric

             post and sustained injuries which culminated in his untimely

             death. In view of the dictum laid down by the apex court, it is

             clear that the claimants/respondents 1 to 4 could not have

             successfully maintained the application under S.163A of the

             Motor Vehicles Act."

            <a href="/doc/100153505/" id="a_13">Section 163</a> of the Act was considered by the Apex Court. In

            that case, the deceased was riding a motorcycle, which dashed

            against a bullock cart proceeding ahead, resulting in the death

            of the motorcyclist. It was in evidence that the deceased had

            borrowed the motorcycle from its owner.        Allowing the claim

            petition filed by the legal representatives under <a href="/doc/22871263/" id="a_14">Section 163A</a> of

            the Act, the Tribunal awarded compensation and directed the

            insurance company to pay the amount. When the matter was

            taken in appeal before the High Court, the High Court held that

            the claim petition was not maintainable as there was no tort

            feasor involved. The said decision was upheld by the Apex

            Court holding that as the deceased who was the borrower,

            stepped into the shoes of the owner, he cannot himself be a

            recipient of compensation as liability to pay the same is on him.

            The legal representatives of the deceased would not be entitled

            to claim compensation, especially because, no other vehicle

            was involved, it was held."</blockquote><p id="p_17">
