                   Criminal Misc Case No. 3598 (B) of 2010

Mahesh                                                             Applicant
                                        Vs
State of U.P                                                       Opp. Party

Hon'ble Raj Mani Chauhan, J.
</pre>
<p id="p_1">        Heard learned counsel for the applicant and learned A.G.A. for the State.
        The accused-applicant Mahesh, who is involved and detained in Case
Crime No. 336 of 2007, under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_1">Sections 302</a>, <a href="/doc/386021/" id="a_2">201</a> I.P.C. and 3 (1) U.P. Gangster
Act, from Police Station Kotwali Nagar, District Sultanpur, has moved second
bail application as the first bail application had been rejected for want of
prosecution.
</p><p id="p_2">        The submission of learned counsel for the applicant is that the entire
prosecution case rests on circumstantial evidence. As per prosecution case, co-
accused Amar Singh and accused applicant on the evening of 14.02.2007 had
taken the deceased with the assurance that they would returned the jewelleries to
him which he had already sold to them for petty amount. Later on, the deceased
was seen along with accused applicant Mahesh, co-accused Amar Singh,
Ramesh and Ravi Patharkat. Co-accused Amar Singh has already been ordered
to be released on bail vide order dated 07.04.2010 passed by another Bench of
this Court in Crl Misc Case No. 1933 (B) of 2010. The case of accused applicant
is the same as against the co-accused Amar Singh. Therefore, accused applicant
also deserves to be released on bail on the ground of parity.
</p><p id="p_3">        Learned A.G.A although opposed the bail application but fairly accepts
that evidence against the accused applicant is the same as against the co-accused
Ramesh Singh and Amar Singh.
</p><p id="p_4">        Considered the submissions of the learned counsel for the applicant and
the learned Additional Government Advocate. Keeping in view the totality of
the facts and circumstances of the case as well as the fact that co-accused Amar
Singh whose case is identical to the case of accused applicant has already been
ordered to be released on bail, without expressing any opinion on the merits of
the case, accused applicant may be released on bail.
</p><p id="p_5">        Let applicant Mahesh be released on bail in aforesaid case crime number
on his furnishing a personal bond with two sureties each in the like amount to the
satisfaction of the court concerned.
