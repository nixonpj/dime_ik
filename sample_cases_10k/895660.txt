JUDGMENT:
</pre><p id="p_1">		      J U D G M E N T.
</p><p id="p_2">Mrs.Sujata V.Manohar.J.
</p><p id="p_3">     This appeal  pertains to a plot of land situated within
C.A.No.19 in  the Vth  Block, Jayanagar, Bangalore City. The
total measurement  of the site which lies between 38th Cross
Road and 42nd Cross Road is 298 mtrs. x 91 mtrs. The site is
in two	parts. The northern portion admeasures 91 mtrs. East
to West	 and 165  mtrs. North to South. It lies between 38th
Cross Road  and the  storm water drain. The southern portion
lies beyond  the storm	water drain  and stretches  upto the
42nd Cross  Road. The  dispute relates	to a  piece of	land
admeasuring 91	mtrs. x	 91 mtrs. in the southern portion of
this site  lying between  10th and 11th main Road and facing
42nd Cross Road.
</p><p id="p_4">     In the  Comprehensive Development Plan framed under the
Karnataka Town	and Country  Planning Act,  1961, which	 has
been published	under Section  23 of  this Act, the northern
portion of  site No.19 has been earmarked for a park and the
southern portion is earmarked for a general purpose which is
a public  or semi-public  purpose. We are concerned with the
portion which  is lying	 in the	 southern part	of this site
which is earmarked for a public or semi-public purpose.
</p><p id="p_5">     At	 the  request  of  the	fourth	respondent,  namely,
Karnataka Chalana  Chitra Kalavidara Sangha, the Corporation
of the City of Bangalore, second respondent herein, passed a
Resolution dated  30.12.1983 resolving	to grant  the  above
plot admeasuring 91 mtrs. x 91 mtrs. to respondent No.4 on a
lease at  an annual  rent of  Rs.500/-.	 The  Government  of
Karnataka accorded  sanction for the same by its Order dated
10.5.1984 under	 which it granted approval for the lease for
a period  of 20	 years on  an annual lease rent of Rs.750/-.
This  was,  however,  modified	by  Government	Order  dated
5.10.1984 enhancing  the period of the lease to 50 years and
reducing the  annual lease rent to Rs.500/-. Accordingly, by
a Deed	of  Lease  dated  11th	of  May,  1986,	 the  second
respondent-Corporation granted	to the	fourth respondent  a
lease of the said plot for the purpose of building a theatre
for the development of drama or films and in order to impart
training to  artists. The  terms and conditions of the lease
are set	 out in the Deed of Lease. The appellants before us,
on coming to know of the said lease, filed a public interest
writ petition before the High Court of Karnataka challenging
the allotment of this plot of land to the fourth respondent.
They contended	that the  said plot which is situated in the
southern portion  of site  No.19 is reserved for a public or
semi-public  purpose  or  for  a  civic	 amenity;  and	that
granting of  lease to  the fourth  respondent is not for the
purpose for  which the	said site  is  earmarked  under	 the
Comprehensive Development plan. The High Court, however, has
rejected the  writ petition.  Hence the	 present appeal	 has
come before us for consideration.
</p><p id="p_6">     Respondent No.4  is  a  society  registered  under	 the
Karnataka Societies  Registration Act.	The objects  of	 the
fourth respondent-Association  as set  out in  clause (3) of
the Memorandum of Association are as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">     "(a) to  promote the  interests  of
     the KANNADA FILM ARTISTS (Actor and
     Actresses)	  in	the   State   of
     Karnataka and  to work  in	 harmony
     with   such    similar    societies
     elsewhere in India;</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">     (b)  to  promote  and  protect  the
     rights and	 privileges of	the Film
     Artists  as  against  outsiders  as
     well   as	  between   and	   among
     themselves;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">     (c)  to  provide  basic  and  other
     amenities	to   the  Film	 Artists
     either  in	  the  course  of  their
     profession or otherwise;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">     (d) to  provide financial and other
     facilities to the family members of
     the  Film	 Artists  at   times  of
     distress due  to death or any other
     disablement of such members;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">     (e) to  provide financial and other
     benefits to  the  members	of  Film
     Artists to	 prosecute education  of
     their children;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_6">     (f) to build and acquire auditorium
     to display	 shows and  concerts for
     the benefit  of the  SANGHA as well
     as to  raise funds	 to be	utilised
     for achieving the objects mentioned
     herein and	 without  involving  any
     activity for profit;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_7">     (g) to  raise funds through regular
     subscriptions     from	members,
     donations	  from	  members    and
     outsiders,	  to   conduct	 benefit
     shows,  stage   shows   and   other
     concerts for the above purposes;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_8">     (h)   to	acquire	  moveable   and
     immoveable properties,  to	 acquire
     income bearing  securities so as to
     raise  regular   incomes  for   the
     society;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_9">     (i)  to   settle	and   compromise
     disputes, if any, among the members
     or	 between   the	 outsiders   and
     members;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_10">     (j)  to   borrow  funds   for   the
     fulfilment of the above objects;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_11">     (k) to  establish or run any school
     for diffusing  necessary  technical
     knowledge for  the benefit	 of  the
     SANGHA".</blockquote>
<p id="p_7">     From the  Statement of Objects and Reasons, it is clear
that  the  fourth  respondent-Association  has	been  formed
basically to  promote the  interests  of  the  Kannada	film
artists	 and   to  protect  and	 promote  their	 rights	 and
interests. One of the objects of the Association is to build
or acquire an auditorium to stage shows and concerts for the
benefit of  the fourth	respondent as well as to raise funds
to achieve  the objects of respondent No.4. The objects also
include establishment  and running of a school for imparting
the necessary  technical skill and knowledge for the benefit
of the	members of the fourth respondent. These purposes can
hardly	be   considered	 as  either  public  or	 semi-public
purposes. The  fourth respondent-Society  is  essentially  a
society to promote the interests of its members who are film
artists. Undoubtedly,  the objects  are	 laudable  but	they
cannot	be  considered	as  objects  which  fall  under	 the
category of a public or semi-public purpose.
</p><p id="p_8">     The grant of the lease is for the purpose of building a
theatre for  the purpose  of giving training to film artists
and for	 the purpose  of development  of drama and films. It
was stated  before us  by learned  counsel  for	 the  fourth
respondent that	 the fourth  respondent proposes  to start a
training school	 for film  artists in the structure which is
to be  constructed on  the leased  plot. It  was also stated
that the theatre to be constructed can be given to any other
organisation or	 individual for	 use. We  presume that	this
would be  on payment  of hire  charges and it would not be a
free use,  since the  fourth respondent	 is  essentially  an
organisation for  the benefit of film artists and its avowed
object is to raise funds and utilise them for the benefit of
film artists. The lease in question, therefore, is not for a
public or  semi-public purpose. It is purely for the benefit
of the fourth respondent.
</p><p id="p_9">     In this  connection out attention has been drawn to the
Building Bye-Laws  of 1983  framed by the Corporation of the
City of	 Bangalore, the	 second respondent.  Schedule  I  of
these  Bye-Laws	 deals	with  land-use	classifications	 and
occupancies (or	 uses) permitted. paragraph 1.2.7 deals with
public and  semi-public uses.  Paragraph 1.2.7.1  enumerates
uses that  are permitted  under this  category.	 These	are:
Government Administration  Centres, Secretariates,  District
Offices, Law  Courts,  Jails,  Police  Stations,  Governor's
Residency and  Institutional Offices,  Educational, Cultural
and Religious  Institutions including Library, Reading Rooms
and Clubs.  Among the uses which are permitted are "cultural
institutions like  community halls,  opera houses  etc. of a
pre-dominantly	non-commercial	nature".  It  also  includes
among the  uses permitted,  parks and  play grounds.  Can we
consider the  allotment of  this plot  to respondent No.4 as
allotment for  a public	 or semi-public	 use as described in
the Bye-Laws?  Although these Bye-Laws do not appear to have
been pointed  out to  the High Court, they have been pointed
out to	us. Unfortunately,  even these	Bye-Laws do not help
respondent No.4.  First of  all respondent  No.4  cannot  be
described  as	an  educational,   cultural   or   religious
institution. It	 is essentially	 a society for the promotion
of interests  of  film	artists.  Secondly,  what  is  being
constructed  is	  not  a   community  hall.  What  is  being
constructed is a theatre to train artists and stage plays or
show films  in that  connection	 along	with  a	 school	 for
training artists.  It is  nowhere stated  that	the  theatre
would be  open to  the public at a nominal cost, or that the
fourth respondent  will not  make profits out of running the
theatre,  or   hiring  it  out	to  other  organisations  or
individuals. In	 fact, one  of the avowed aims of respondent
No. 4  is to  earn income  which can  be  utilised  for	 the
objects of  the Association.  In the  circumstances,  it  is
difficult to  accept the  contention of the respondents that
the allotment  of this	plot is	 for a public or semi-public
purpose.
</p><p id="p_10">     The appellants  also contended  that the  lease was not
for the purpose of providing a civic amenity. They sought to
draw support  from the	definition of  `civic amenity' under
section 2(bb)  of the Bangalore Development Authority Act of
1976. Section  2(bb) although  it was introduced in 1988, is
given effect  from  21.4.1984  i.e.  a	date  prior  to	 the
execution of  the lease	 in favour  of the fourth repondent.
Under Section 2(bb) `civic amenity' is defined as follows:
</p>	  Civic amenity means:
<blockquote id="blockquote_12">	  "Section 2(bb):/  (i) a  market,  a
	  post office,	a Telephone Exchange,
	  a Bank  a Fair  price Shop,  a milk
	  Booth, a  Dispensary, a Hospital, a
	  Pathological	   Laboratory,	    a
	  Maternity  Home,   a	 child	 care
	  Centre, a  Library, a	 Gymnasium, a
	  Bus stand or a Bus Depot;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_13">	  (ii) A Recreation Centre run by the
	  Government or the Corporation;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_14">	  (iii)	 A  Centre  for	 educational,
	  social   or	cultural   activities
	  established	 by    the    central
	  Government or	 the state Government
	  or by	 a Body	 established  by  the
	  Central   Government	  or	State
	  Government;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_15">	  (iv)	A   Centre  for	 educational,
	  religious,   social	or   cultural
	  activities  or   for	philanthropic
	  service  run	 by   a	  cooperative
	  society registered  under  the  co-
	  operative   <a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_1">Societies	  Act</a>,	 1959
	  (karnataka Act  11 of	 1959)	or  a
	  Society   registered	  under	  the
	  karnataka  <a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_2">Societies	 Registration
	  Act</a>,	1960  (karnataka  Act  17  of
	  1960) or  by a Trust created wholly
	  for  charitable,   educational   or
	  religious purposes;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_16">	  (v)  A   Police  Station,  an	 area
	  office or  a service station of the
	  Corporation of  the Bangalore Water
	  Supply and  Sewerage Board  or  the
	  Karnataka Electricity Board; and
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_17">	  (vi)	such  other  amenity  as  the
	  Government  may   by	notification,
	  specify".</blockquote>
<p id="p_11">     The portion  relevant for	our purposes  is sub-section
</p><p id="p_12">(iv) which  deals with	a centre for educational, religious,
social or  cultural activities	or for philanthropic service
run, inter alia, by a society registered under the Karnataka
Societies Registration	Act, 1960.  The	 activities  of	 the
fourth respondent,  in our view, would not fall under any of
these categories.  They are  activities of  a very  specific
nature aimed at imparting training and promoting the welfare
of film	 artists. They	are  not  activities  which  can  be
generally classified  as  educational,	social	or  cultural
activities. Under  section 38-A of the Bangalore Development
Authority Act,	there is  a prohibition	 against selling  or
otherwise disposing  of any  area reserved for	public parks
and play  grounds and civic amenities for any other purpose;
and any	 disposition so	 made shall  be null  and void.	 The
appellants also	 drew our  attention to Section 16(1) of the
Bangalore Development  Authority Act  of 1976. Under <a href="/doc/901379/" id="a_3">Section
16(1)</a>,	every  development  scheme  shall  provide  for	 the
reservation of	not less  than 15%  of the total area of the
lay out	 for public parks and play grounds and an additional
area of 10% of the lay out for civic amenities. They contend
that the  area in question falls within this reservation and
hence should  not be  used for	any other  purpose.  In	 the
absence, however,  of any  relevant data  showing that	this
plot is within this minimum reservation we are not examining
this contention	 of the	 appellants.  In  any  view  of	 the
matter, since  the plot	 is reserved under the comprehensive
Development plan  for a	 public or  semi-public purpose, the
lease in  favour of  respondent No. 4 cannot be upheld since
it is  in violation  of the  purpose for  which the site has
been earmarked.
</p><p id="p_13">     It was  contended before  us by the respondents that in
the case  of  Jagdish  v.  Bangalore  Development  Authority
(judgment dated 7th of January, 1990 in Writ Appeal No. 2781
of 1990	 before the  High Court	 of karnatka,  the  Division
Bench consisting  of Justice  S. Mohan, Chief justice, as he
then was,  and Justice Shivraj Patil) allotment of a plot of
land in	 the same southern portion of this very site for the
construction  of   a  community	  hall	by   the   Municipal
Corporation of	Bangalore City	was upheld.  This was also a
public interest	 litigation challenging the allotment of the
plot for the construction of a community hall. The challenge
was negatived. That plot is not the same plot as the present
plot. However,	this plot  is also  situated within the same
southern portion  of Survey  no. 19  which has been reserved
for a  public or semi-public purpose under the Comprehensive
Development plan.  In the  case before	the  Karnataka	high
Court in  the above  appeal, however, the Corporation of the
City of	 bangalore proposed to construct a community hall in
a portion  of the said area at a cost of Rs. 9 lakhs for the
benefit of  the public.	 This was upheld as a public purpose
and the	 construction of a community hall by the Corporation
of the	City of Bangalore was considered as a civic amenity.
The present  lease, however,  is  for  a  purpose  which  is
altogether  different.	Therefore,  the	 respondents  cannot
derive any  support from the above case. On the contrary, it
is clear  that in  the above  case also	 the High  Court has
upheld the  contention of  the appellants  that the  site in
question, namely,  the southern	 portion of  C.A. No.  19 is
reserved for  a public	or  semi-public	 purpose  under	 the
Comprehensive Development Plan.
</p><p id="p_14">     In view  thereof, the  present appeal  is allowed.	 The
said lease  in favour of the fourth respondent is set aside.
The  respondents   are	restrained  from  carrying  out	 any
construction activity on the said open space allotted to the
fourth	respondent   under  the	 said  lease  deed.  In	 the
circumstances, however, there will be no order as to costs.
