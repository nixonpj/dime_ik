 Dated: 23/04/2012

: Judgement 


                            ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">          (Passed on this 23rd day of April, 2012)

          (Writ Petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1">Article 226</a> of the
                   Constitution of India)


</p><p id="p_2">1.   Since, W.P.(S) Nos.1740, 1741, 1742, 1743, 1744 &amp; 1745 

     of 2012 involved the same question of facts and law, they

     are being decided by this common order.
</p>
<p id="p_3">

</p><p id="p_4">2.   The petitioners impugn the letter dated 23.03.2012
(Annexure P-1), whereunder, the petitioners have been asked
to produce properly verified caste certificate within a
period of seven days.
</p><p id="p_5">3.   Learned counsel appearing for the petitioners submits

     that in identical situation, this Court has granted six

     months  time to produce the certificate in  W.P.(S)

     No.4505/2011 (Lela Bai Baiga v. State of Chhattisgarh &amp;

     Others). The petitioners have filed a copy of the order

     passed in other cases without explaining asto how the other

     matters were similar to the present cases.



</p><p id="p_6">4.   On  perusal of the letter dated 23.03.2012,  it  is

     evident that the petitioners were served the notice on

     06.12.2010, by the Chief Executive Officer, Janpad Panchayat

     Kota, to produce properly verified caste certificate, as the

     petitioners claimed employment on being Baiga caste, which

     comes under the Scheduled Tribe category. Thereafter, one

     more notice was issued to the petitioners on 03.03.2011. The

     petitioners failed to take any steps to produce the required

     social status certificate duly approved by the High Power

     Caste Scrutiny Committee (for short "the Committee"). This

     is a third notice in the nature of reminder, which is under

     challenge in these petitions.
</p>
<p id="p_7">

</p><p id="p_8">5.   Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that the

     petitioners may be granted six months time to continue in

     the post and in the meantime, they will obtain the caste

     certificate under the provisions of law and produce the same

     before the concerned authority.
</p>
<p id="p_9">

</p><p id="p_10">6.   The petitioners have to produce the caste certificate

     duly verified by the Committee at the time of appointment,

     as the petitioners were claiming appointment on the basis of

     being Schedule Tribe. More than 18 months have passed, the

     petitioners had not done anything, even had not made

     application to the Committee for verification of the caste

     certificate.
</p>
<p id="p_11">

</p><p id="p_12">7.   The  reliance of the petitioner on the order  dated

     11.08.2011, passed in W.P.(S) No.4505/2011 is misplaced, as

     it is pleaded by the learned State counsel that in that case

     application was already filed and since, there was some

     delay in getting the certificate; thus the order was passed.

     However, in the cases on hand, the petitioners have not

     shown anywhere that they had taken any steps for obtaining

     proper verified caste certificate from the Committee.



</p><p id="p_13">8.   In view of the above, granting relief at this stage,
would amount to continuation of illegality, as the claim of
the petitioners is based on the fact that they belongs to
Scheduled Tribe without producing properly verified caste
certificate to that aspect. Though, the petitioners have
produced undated temporary caste certificate whereas the
year 2009-10 is mentioned and the same was valid for six
months only not beyond that.

<p id="p_16">

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">               "13.  The admission wrongly  gained
               or  appointment wrongly obtained on
               the  basis  of false social  status
               certificate  necessarily  has   the
               effect  of  depriving  the  genuine
               Scheduled   Castes   or   Scheduled
               Tribes   or   OBC   candidates   as
               enjoined in the Constitution of the
               benefits conferred on them  by  the
               Constitution.      The      genuine
               candidates    are    also    denied
               admission       to      educational
               institutions  or  appointments   to
               office  or posts under a State  for
               want  of social status certificate.
               The  ineligible or spurious persons
               who falsely gained entry resort  to
               dilatory tactics and create hurdles
               in  completion of the inquiries  by
               the  Scrutiny Committee. It is true
               that the applications for admission
               to   educational  institutions  are
               generally  made by a parent,  since
               on   that  date  many  a  time  the
               student may be a minor. It  is  the
               parent or the guardian who may play
               fraud    claiming   false    status
               certificate.   It  is,   therefore,
               necessary   that  the  certificates
               issued   are  scrutinized  at   the
               earliest and with utmost expedition
               and  promptitude. For that purpose,
               it  is necessary to streamline  the
               procedure   for  the  issuance   of
               social  status certificates,  their
               scrutiny and their approval,  which
               may be the following :

               Officer  and  Deputy  Collector  or
               Deputy    Commissioner   and    the
               certificate shall be issued by such
               officer rather than at the Officer,
               Taluk or Mandal level.

               shall  file an affidavit duly sworn
               and   attested   by   a   competent
               gazetted  officer  or  non-gazetted
               officer with particulars of  castes
               and   sub-castes,   tribe,   tribal
               community,  parts  or   groups   of
               tribes  or tribal communities,  the
               place   from  which  he  originally
               hails from and other particulars as
               may    be    prescribed   by    the
               Directorate concerned.

               before   seeking   admission   into

of the  verification  of social status  certificate,  no

     direction can be issued to the authorities to continue

     properly duly verified caste certificate by the Committee.
