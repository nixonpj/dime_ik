                                  .. Respondent/Respondent.


        Appeal filed under Clause 15 of Letters Patent against the order dated
16-10-1998 of Single Judge of this Court in Writ Petition No.  6792 of 1990.

!Mr.  D.  Hariparanthaman:- For Appellant.

^Mr.  V.  Radhakrishnan:- For Respondent.




:JUDGMENT   
</pre><p id="p_1">(Judgment of the Court was delivered by P.  Sathasivam, J.,)

Aggrieved  by the order of learned Single Judge dated 16-1 0-1998 made in Writ
Petition No.  6792 of 1990, Central Organisation  of  Tamil  Nadu  Electricity
Employees through  its Secretary has filed the above Writ Appeal.  In the Writ
Petition the said Employees Union questioned the  order  in  B.P  (FB)  No.24,
Administrative  Branch  dated 15-5-1990 which enhanced the training period for
three years though at the time of selection/appointment the  same  was  for  a
period of one year.
</p>
<p id="p_2">2.   According to the Secretary of the Union, based on their efforts and other
interested parties, the respondent Board agreed to provide employment for each
family whose land was acquired for the establishment  of  the  Mettur  Thermal
Power Project.    In  pursuance  of the said decision, the respondent Board in
proceedings No.33, dated 13-6-89, agreed to provide employment for one  person
from each displaced family on a consolidated salary of Rs.500/- p.m.  and with
a  further  assurance  that  after a period of one year, they will be absorbed
against regular vacancies.    Similar  provision  was  also  made  to  provide
employment to those persons whose near relatives died in harness.  However, in
the impugned  proceedings i.e., in B.P.  24 dated 15-5-90, the Board issued an
order enhancing the training period for three years.  It is the claim  of  the
Union  that  the  respondent had not given any notice under <a href="/doc/620295/" id="a_1">Section 9-A</a> of the
Industrial Disputes Act, 1947; hence, it is not open  to  them  to  alter  the
condition of service of the workmen without following the procedure prescribed
under the said Act.
</p>

<p id="p_3">3.   The  Board  filed  a  counter  affidavit  stating that the members in the
families displaced on account of acquisition of land are mostly un-educated or
under-educated, therefore for want of vacancies in posts  suitable  for  them,
they could not be provided with employment assistance, however, in view of the
compelling  necessity  the  persons  who  lost  their land were considered for
appointment as trainees.  Accordingly, the  Board  issued  B.P.(PB)  No.    33
Administrative Branch dated 13-6-1989 that members of displaced families whose
cases  are  pending  consideration shall be appointed on consolidated wages of
Rs.5 00/- p.m.  so that they could be absorbed in regular post  later  as  and
when  they  become eligible after satisfactory completion of one year training
period.  It is further stated that for establishment of North  Madras  Thermal
Power  Project,  the  Tamil  Nadu  Electricity Board has acquired lands and in
order to get the areas released from the villagers for expediting the  project
work,  the Board has agreed to provide them employment assistance relaxing the
norms prescribed.  On the understanding reached, the Board  issued  orders  in
B.P.  (FB) No.  3 dated 2 5-1-90 that besides other conditions one male member
in each family be appointed as Helper (Trainee) for a period of three years on
consolidated wages  at the rate of Rs.500/- p.m.  for the first year; Rs.650/-
p.m.  for the  second  year;  and  Rs.800/-p.m.    for  the  third  year,  and
thereafter the training period namely one year has been re-examined and orders
issued in  B.P.   dated 15-5-90 enhancing the period of 3 years as well as the
rate of increased wages for every subsequent years to all the cases covered in
B.P.  Nos.  36 and 37 dated 25-6-1989 and B.P.No.  362 dated 11-7-1989.
</p>
<p id="p_4">4.   The  learned  Single  Judge  while  accepting  the  stand  taken  by  the
Electricity  Board  and  taking note of the fact that the appellant/petitioner
could not get employment for want of vacancy  in  suitable  post,  hence  they
(dependants) have been appointed only as trainees and not as regular employees
and  that  the  appointments  are on compassionate claim so that they could be
appointed to regular posts on  acquiring  sufficient  experience,  upheld  the
stand  taken  by  the  Board  and  dismissed the writ petition; hence the Writ
Appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_5">5.  Mr.  D.  Hariparanthaman, learned  counsel  for  the  appellant  employees
Union,  submitted  that  inasmuch  as  the respondent had not given any notice
under <a href="/doc/620295/" id="a_2">Section 9-A</a> of the Industrial Disputes Act, it is not open  to  them  to
alter  the condition of service of the workmen without following the procedure
under the said Act.  He further submitted that the  prescription  of  3  years
training  period even for the post of Helper is arbitrary and the intention of
the respondent is to exploit these workmen by paying low salary.
</p>
<p id="p_6">6.  With reference to the above contention, we heard Mr.  V.    Radhakrishnan,
learned counsel for the respondent.  On going through the details furnished in
the counter affidavit and considering the arguments of the learned counsel for
the  respondent-Board,  we  are unable to accept the contention of the learned
counsel for the appellant for the following reasons.
</p>
<p id="p_7">7.  It is not in dispute that in order  to  mitigate  the  sufferings  of  the
persons  who had given their lands for the project of the Electricity Board so
also expediting the project by getting the  required  land  from  the  persons
concerned,  the  Board  decided  to  provide  employment  assistance  to them.
Similar provision was also made in respect of persons who died in  harness  in
the existing  vacancies  subject  to other conditions.  It is true that before
the impugned order, the persons appointed  on  the  said  categories  have  to
undergo  training  for  one  year  and  during  that period, they will be paid
consolidated wages  of  Rs.500/-  per  month.    However,  at  the   time   of
establishment  of  North  Madras Thermal Power Project, the Board has acquired
vast lands in the villages for expediting the project, and  therefore  it  has
agreed to  provide employment assistance relaxing the norms prescribed.  It is
further brought to our notice that on the  understanding  reached,  the  Board
issued orders  in  B.P  (F.B)  No.    3  dated 25-01-1990, according to which,
besides other conditions, one male member  in  each  family  be  appointed  as
Helper  (Trainee)  for  a  period  of  three  years  on a consolidated wage of
Rs.500/- p.m.  for the first year; Rs.650/- p.m.  for  the  second  year;  and
Rs.800/- p.m.  for the third year.
</p>
<p id="p_8">8.   As  rightly  pointed out by the learned counsel for the respondent-Board,
all the Board proceedings deal with appointments on compassionate grounds only 
and taking note of non-availability of the vacancy, the Board re-examined  the
training  period  and  issued  orders  in the Board proceedings dated 15-5-90,
enhancing the period of 3 years as well as the rate  of  increased  wages  for
every subsequent  years  to all the cases covered in B.P.Nos.  36 and 37 dated
26-6-1989 and B.P.No.  362 dated 11-7-1989.  It is also relevant to  note  the
information  furnished  in the counter affidavit that it has been decided that
the dependants of the deceased employees and members in the  displaced  family 
who  have  passed  at least VIII Standard, have to be engaged as Office Helper
(Trainees) and Helper (Trainees)and that the qualification prescribed for  the
post   of   Helper   is  possession  of  National  Trade  Certificate/National
Apprenticeship Certificate in certain trades.    The  dependants  who  do  not
possess  the  prescribed  qualification  are  not  eligible to be appointed as
Helper.  In those circumstances, the Board had taken a policy decision that in
view of acute financial crisis, the vacancies in the  post  of  Office  Helper
which  have  low priority should not be filled up pending review of sanctions.
It is also brought to our notice  that  the  report  of  the  Comptroller  and
Auditor  General of India which points out that as per the planning commission
Standards 5.5 employees are needed for sale of 1 million  units,  whereas  the
actual men-in-position per million units sold in the Board worked out to 8.69,
7.77  and 7.64 during the 3 years upto 1986-87 respectively and thus the extra
employee  cost  on  account  of  surplus   man   power   was   130.85   crores
(approximately) during these three years period.  In such circumstances, it is
explained  that  as  the  employment  assistance is subject to availability of
vacancies, and in such a contingency, the Board would have  denied  employment 
assistance  and instead, on compassionate grounds, they are being appointed as
Trainees on consolidated wages. 
</p>
<p id="p_9">9.  In the light of the details and in view of the fact that a policy decision
was taken by the Board taking note of the  nonavailability  of  vacancies  and
also  existence  of  more  man-power than production of electricity, the Board
extended the period of training for 3 years.  It is also relevant to note that
the Board has also increased the wages  from  Rs.500/-  to  Rs.650/-  for  the
second year  and  Rs.8  00/-  for  the third year.  In such circumstances, the
decision of the Board cannot be  faulted  with.    Further,  inasmuch  as  the
appointments  are  on compassionate grounds, considering the grievances of the
displaced persons, we feel there is  no  question  of  alteration  of  service
condition as  claimed  by the learned counsel for the appellant.  Further, the
Board itself reduced the training period from three years to one year  in  the
subsequent proceedings  in  B.P  (FB)  No.   56 ( Administrative Branch) dated
30-8-1994 and also enhanced the wages from Rs.500/- to Rs.750/-per month  with 
effect from 01-09-1994.  The learned Single Judge considered all these aspects
and rightly dismissed the Writ Petition.
</p>
<p id="p_10">10.   Under  these  circumstances,  we  do  not  find  any  valid  ground  for
interference; consequently the Appeal fails and the same  is  dismissed.    No
costs.
