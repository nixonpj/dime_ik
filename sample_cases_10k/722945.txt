<pre id="pre_1">           CASE NO.:
Appeal (crl.)  589 of 1999

PETITIONER:
State of Himachal Pradesh

RESPONDENT:
Shree Kant Shekari

DATE OF JUDGMENT: 13/09/2004

BENCH:
ARIJIT PASAYAT &amp; PRAKASH PRABHAKAR NAOLEKAR

JUDGMENT:
</pre><p id="p_1">J U D G M E N T


ARIJIT PASAYAT, J.
</p>


<p id="p_2">	The factual matrix of this appeal is unfortunately related to 
sordid and obnoxious incidents where the respondent (hereinafter 
referred to as 'accused') who at the relevant point of time was working 
as a teacher gratified his animated passions and sexual pleasures by 
having carnal knowledge of his student, a girl of tender age. The 
result was that the sacred relation of teacher and his pupil was 
besmirched. As observed by this Court in <a href="/doc/1314858/" id="a_1">Madan Gopal Kakkad v. Narain 
Dubey and Anr</a>. (1992 (2) Crimes 168) such offenders are menace to the 
civilized society.  
</p>

<p id="p_3">	The State of Himachal Pradesh is in appeal against the judgment 
of a learned Single Judge of the Himachal Pradesh High Court directing 
acquittal of the accused who faced trial for alleged commission of 
offences punishable under <a href="/doc/1279834/" id="a_2">Sections 376</a> and <a href="/doc/180217/" id="a_3">506</a> of the Indian Penal 
Code, 1860 (in short the '<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_4">IPC</a>'). The trial Court i.e. the Sessions 
Court, Kinnaur had convicted and sentenced him to undergo imprisonment 
for 7 years and a fine of Rs.2,000/- for the first offence and one year 
and a fine of Rs.2,000/- for the second offence. In addition, the 
accused was directed to pay compensation of Rs.10,000/- to the 
prosecutrix. 
</p>
<p id="p_4">	Sexual violence apart from being a dehumanizing act is an 
unlawful intrusion on the right of privacy and sanctity of a	female.  It is a serious blow to her supreme honour and offends her self-esteem and dignity  it degrades and humiliates the victim and where the victim is a helpless innocent child or a minor, it leaves 
behind a traumatic experience. A rapist not only causes physical 
injuries but more indelibly leaves a scar on the most cherished 
possession of a woman i.e. her dignity, honour, reputation and not the 
least her chastity. Rape is not only a crime against the person of a 
woman, it is a crime against the entire society. It destroys, as noted 
by this Court in <a href="/doc/642436/" id="a_5">Shri Bodhisattwa Gautam v. Miss Subhra Chakraborty</a> 
(AIR 1996 SC 922), the entire psychology of a woman and pushes her into 
deep emotional crisis. It is a crime against basic human rights, and is 
also violative of the victim's most cherished of the Fundamental 
Rights, namely, the Right to Life contained in <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_6">Article 21</a> of the 
Constitution of India, 1950 (in short the 'Constitution') The Courts 
are, therefore, expected to deal with cases of sexual crime against 
women with utmost sensitivity. Such cases need to be dealt with sternly 
and severely.  A socially sensitized judge, in our opinion, is a better 
statutory armour in cases of crime against women than long clauses of 
penal provisions, containing complex exceptions and provisos. 
</p>
<p id="p_5">We do not propose to mention name of the victim. <a href="/doc/1696350/" id="a_7">Section 228-A</a> of 
IPC makes disclosure of identity of victim of certain offences 
punishable. Printing or publishing name of any matter which may make 
known the identity of any person against whom an offence under <a href="/doc/1279834/" id="a_8">Sections 
376</a>, <a href="/doc/668689/" id="a_9">376-A</a>, <a href="/doc/396/" id="a_10">376-B</a>, <a href="/doc/1553346/" id="a_11">376-C</a> or 376-D is alleged or found to have been 
committed can be punished. True it is, the restriction, does not relate 
to printing or publication of judgment by High Court or Supreme Court. 
But keeping in view the social object of preventing social 
victimization or ostracism of the victim of a sexual offence for which 
<a href="/doc/1696350/" id="a_12">Section 228-A</a> has been enacted, it would be appropriate that in the 
judgments, be it of this Court, High Court or lower Court, the name of 
the victim should not be indicated. We have chosen to describe her as 
'victim' in the judgment. (<a href="/doc/46627/" id="a_13">See State of Karnataka v. Puttaraja</a> (2003 
(8) Supreme 364) 

	Prosecution version as unfolded during trial is essentially as 
follows: 
</p>
<p id="p_6">	On 28.5.1993 the accused Shree Kant asked the victim  who was his 
student of class 4 to wait after school hours for solving a question, 
while he allowed other students to go. The victim remained in the class 
room when the accused bolted the door from inside and made the victim 
to lie on the floor and forcibly committed sexual intercourse with her.  
She kept refusing, wept and cried.  However, since the doors of the 
room were closed, none could hear her cries.  He then threatened her 
that if she dared to narrate the incident to anyone, he would throw her 
into the river.  Being threatened she did not disclose this fact to any 
person.  
</p>
<p id="p_7">	Few days after the first incident the accused had taken her and 
three other students to Chuha Bagh for cleaning his room.  The accused 
sent the other three students out of the room and kept her inside the 
room.  He bolted the door of the room and made her lie on the floor and 
committed sexual intercourse with her again.
</p>
<p id="p_8">	In September, 1993 the victim stopped going to school.  As she 
regularly complained of stomach ache, her mother took her to Rampur 
Hospital where after examination by Doctor (PW-1), mother of the victim 
learnt that she was pregnant.  On enquiry by her mother, the victim 
disclosed to her mother that her conception was due to sexual 
intercourse by the accused. After returning to the village, mother of 
the victim discussed the matter with her husband and then disclosed the 
incident to Krishna, a member of Gram Panchayat who suggested to report 
the matter to the police.
</p>
<p id="p_9">	On 20.11.1993, the victim lodged a report at police station, 
Rampur. On the basis of such report a case under <a href="/doc/1279834/" id="a_14">Section 376</a> and <a href="/doc/180217/" id="a_15">506</a> 
IPC was registered vide FIR No.365/1993 (Ex.PW3/A).
</p>
<p id="p_10">	During the course of investigation the victim (PW-3) was 
medically examined on 20.11.1993 at 4.00 p.m.  Such medical examination 
was carried out by doctor (PW-1) of Refural Hospital, Rampur. In her 
opinion her period of gestation was 28 weeks.          
</p>	


<p id="p_11">	On the completion of investigation, charge sheet was placed and 
matter was taken up for trial. Twelve witnesses were examined to 
further the prosecution version. The key witnesses were the victim 
herself who was examined as PW-3, her mother (PW-4), father (PW-5) and 
other witnesses who had spoken about the age of the victim. Placing 
reliance on the evidence of the victim the trial Court found the 
accused guilty, convicted and sentenced him as aforesaid. 
</p>
<p id="p_12">	The accused questioned his conviction and sentence imposed before 
the High Court. A learned Single Judge by the impugned judgment set 
aside the judgment of the trial Court and directed acquittal. 
</p>
<p id="p_13">	Learned counsel for the appellant-State submitted that the High 
Court has failed to analyse the factual and the legal position in the 
proper perspective and has kept out of consideration relevant matters 
and drawn the presumptuous conclusions and, therefore, the judgment is 
to be set aside. There is no appearance on behalf of the accused in 
spite of service of notice. 
</p>
<p id="p_14">The factors which seem to have weighed with the High Court are 
</p><p id="p_15">(i) the age of the victim, which according to the High Court was more 
than 16 years; (ii) no evidence has been placed by the prosecution to 
show that the victim had not consented to the act; and (iii) the time 
of alleged rape as given by the victim and her mother was 
improbabilised by the medical evidence. A particular reference was made 
to the fact that a child was born on 10.4.1979 and if the alleged rape 
has been committed during the period indicated by the victim and her 
mother the same would have been altogether different periods. The delay 
in lodging the first information report was also highlighted to attach 
vulnerability to the prosecution case.
</p>
<p id="p_16">	We shall first deal with the question of age. The radiological 
test indicated age of the victim between 15 to 16= years. The school 
records were produced to establish that her date of birth was 
10.4.1979. The relevant documents are Ex.PW6/A to PW6/C. The High Court 
was of the view that these documents were not sufficient to establish 
age of the victim because there was another document Ex.PW7/A which 
according to the High Court did not relate to the victim.  Merely 
because one document which was produced by the prosecution did not, 
according to the High Court relate to the victim that was not 
sufficient to ignore the evidentiary value of Ex.PW6/A to Ex.PW6/C. 
These were records regarding admission of the victim to the school and 
her period of study. These documents unerringly prove that the date of 
birth of the victim as per official records was 10.4.1979. Therefore, 
on the date of occurrence and even when the FIR was lodged on 
20.11.1993 she was about 14 years of age. Therefore, the question of 
consent was really of no consequence.     
</p>
<p id="p_17">	Even otherwise the High Court seems to have fallen in grave error 
in coming to the conclusion that the victim has not shown that the act 
was not done with her consent. It was not for the victim to show that 
there was no consent.  Factually also the conclusion is erroneous right 
from the beginning that is from the stage when the FIR was lodged and 
in her evidence there was a categorical statement that the rape was 
forcibly done notwithstanding protest by the victim. The High Court was 
therefore wrong in putting burden on the victim to show that there was 
no consent. The question of consent is really a matter of defence by 
the accused and it was for him to place materials to show that there 
was consent. It is significant to note that during cross examination 
and the statement recorded under <a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_16">Section 313</a> of the Code of Criminal 
Procedure, 1973 (in short the 'Code') plea of consent was not taken or 
pleaded. In fact in the statement under <a href="/doc/140515/" id="a_17">Section 313</a> of the Code the 
plea was complete denial and false implication. 
</p>
<p id="p_18">The High Court has also committed error in making hypothetical 
calculations regarding dates to doubt the testimony of the victim and 
her mother. What the witnesses had stated were approximate dates or 
periods and not that they were to be reckoned with exactitude. The 
victim is not an intelligent girl as the evidence on record shows. She 
passed out Class 3 on the third attempt. Her mother, a rustic woman is 
practically illiterate. To examine their evidence with microscopic 
approach would be an insult to justice oriented judicial system. It 
would be totally detached from the realities of life. 
</p>
<p id="p_19">The High Court has also disbelieved the prosecution version for 
the so-called delay in lodging the FIR. The prosecution has not only 
explained the reasons but also led cogent evidence to substantiate the 
stand as to why there was delay. The trial Court in fact analysed the 
position in great detail and had come to a right conclusion that the 
reasons for the delay in lodging the FIR have been clearly explained. 
</p>
<p id="p_20">The unusual circumstances satisfactorily explained the delay in 
lodging of the first information report.  In any event, delay per se is 
not a mitigating circumstance for the accused when accusations of rape 
are involved.  Delay in lodging first information report cannot be used 
as a ritualistic formula for discarding prosecution case and doubting 
its authenticity.  It only puts the court on guard to search for and 
consider if any explanation has been offered for the delay.  Once it is 
offered, the Court is to only see whether it is satisfactory or not.  
In a case if the prosecution fails to satisfactory explain the delay 
and there is possibility of embellishment or exaggeration in the 
prosecution version on account of such delay, it is a relevant factor.  
On the other hand satisfactory explanation of the delay is weighty 
enough to reject the plea of false implication or vulnerability of 
prosecution case.  As the factual scenario shows, the victim was 
totally unaware of the catastrophe which had befallen to her.  That 
being so, the mere delay in lodging of first information report does 
not in any way render prosecution version brittle. These aspects were 
highlighted in <a href="/doc/741918/" id="a_18">Tulshidas Kanolkar v. State of Goa</a> (2003 (8) SCC 590).  
</p>
<p id="p_21">The High Court by hypothetical calculations has concluded that 
there were discrepancies and has come to the presumptuous conclusion on 
mere surmises and conjectures that there was unexplained delay in 
lodging the FIR. In view of the above, conclusions of the High Court 
are not to be sustained. 
</p>
<p id="p_22">It was also pleaded by the accused before the High Court which 
seems to have weighed regarding absence of any corroboration to the 
victim's evidence. 
</p>
<p id="p_23">It is well settled that a prosecutrix complaining of having been 
a victim of the offence of rape is not an accomplice after the crime. 
There is no rule of law that her testimony cannot be acted without 
corroboration in material particulars. She stands at a higher pedestal 
than an injured witness. In the latter case, there is injury on the 
physical form, while in the former it is physical as well as 
psychological and emotional. However, if the court on facts finds it 
difficult to accept the version of the prosecutrix on its face value, 
it may search for evidence, direct or circumstantial, which would lend 
assurance to her testimony. Assurance, short of corroboration as 
understood in the context of an accomplice would suffice. 
</p>
<p id="p_24">The victim has categorically stated that she was afraid of the 
accused who was her teacher and the threats given by him to the extent 
that she would be put to physical harm if she spoke about the incident 
to anybody. The stand of the accused that he was falsely implicated 
because brother of the victim was not successful in the examination and 
therefore, his family had grudge against the accused is too swallow to 
be accepted. The incident which involved the accused and mother and 
brother of the victim took place about a decade back. There is not even 
remote possibility of the same being the foundation for false 
implication. In any event no girl of a tender age and her parents would 
like to jeopardize her entire future by falsely implicating a person 
alleging forcible sexual intercourse.  
</p>
<p id="p_25">Looked at from any angle, judgment of the High Court is 
indefensible and the same is accordingly set aside. The order of the 
trial Court is restored. Accused shall surrender to custody forthwith 
to serve remainder of sentence. The appeal is allowed.
