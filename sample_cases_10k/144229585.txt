         3.     The           grounds               mentioned                     for            ordering
         withdrawal/cancellation                       of         the       recognisation                  are
</pre><p id="p_3">         firstly that the school building is situated on the
         plot which is owned by the Municipal Corporation of
         the Ahmedabad city and that it is not possible to
         regularise the building, as no such provisions in
         Gujarat Regularisation of Un-authorised Development
         Act, 2001, exists.                      The second reason mentioned is
         that    in      one      building,                    two     schools           by      the       two
         different trustees are been run, which is in breach
         of    the     Right           of   Children            to      Free       and       Compulsory
         Education Rules, 2012.                      The third reason indicated is
         that the salary of the staff is not paid through
         bank,    as      required.               The          next      ground         is      that       the
         recruitment of the teachers is not in accordance with
         law, in particular as per the schedule-F, and further
         that    except         one,        none       of       the       teachers            have       been
         possessing the requisite qualifications. Last ground
         mentioned         is      that      presently                the      strength             of     the
         students is not adequate.

                      but he was not informed the petitioner trust pursuant
                      to the proposal received by him. There after hearing
                      was kept on 27th July 2015 by letter dated 6th July of
                      respondent no.3

                            On 27th July 2015 the petitioner remained present
                      before the respondent no.3 and requested him to
                      provide a necessary documents and it is categorically
                      contended that no proposal dated 12th May, 2015 as
                      alleged is submitted by the Shree Gayatri Education
                      Trust if any proposal is there on record to provide
                      such proposal along with documents if any attached to
                      the said proposal.     However the respondent no.3 has
                      not supplied so called proposal or any documents to
                      the petitioner."

                      documents as demanded through letter dated 24th May

         including copy of proposal dated 12.05.2015 by which

         stated that subsequently the petitioner could obtain
         the   copy      of     the    said      proposal              dated         12.05.2005
         through the procedure of applying under the Right to
         <a href="/doc/1965344/" id="a_1">Information Act</a>, 2005.                   However, the fact remains
         that when the order was passed, the copy was not
         available and it became available subsequent to the
         passing of the order.
</p>

<p id="p_9">         4.1 Learned Assistant Government Pleader stated that
         the said proposal was muted by the trusts itself and
         therefore      it     was    not    necessary              to      supply          a    copy
         thereof.       The same is not required to be going into
         in view of nature of the order being passed by this
         court.

<p id="p_10">         4.2 The      petition        was   contested               by     one       Rakeshbhai
         Prahladbhai Patel, who happens to be the managing
         trustee.      The respondent No.4 appears to be in favour
         of the closure of the school and he supported the
         impugned order.             It was submitted on behalf of the
         fourth respondent by his learned advocate that the
         petition       is      guided      by         the       ill-motive               of       the
         petitioner, who is not authorised representative of
         the trust, but who wants to capture the trusteeship
         of the trust.              This aspect is not germane and the
         dispute about the trusteeship has to be agitated and
         resolved before the appropriate machinery as per law.

<p id="p_11">         5.    Having regard to the fact that the petitioner

         looked into for defending his case, the order could
         be        said    to   be      wanting       in     terms       of      compliance               of
         principles of natural justice.                               It is only on the
         ground of not giving opportunity of hearing to the
         petitioner that the same liable to be set aside.                                                 No
         other aspects of the matter is required to be gone
