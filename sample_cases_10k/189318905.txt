      IN THE HIGH COURT OF PUNJAB AND HARYANA AT
                     CHANDIGARH


                                                   CWP No. 18458 of 2016

Gora Lal Jindal                                                  ....Petitioner(s)

                                     Versus

State of Punjab and others                                      ...Respondent(s)

CORAM: HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE G.S.SANDHAWALIA

Present:    Mr. Nakul Sharma, Advocate,
            for the petitioner.

G.S.SANDHAWALIA, J. (Oral)
</pre>
<p id="p_1">            The petitioner seeks quashing of the communication dated

03.03.2016 (Annexure P-8) issued by respondent no. 3.            Vide the said

communication, the petitioner has been directed to deposit a sum of

`75,904/- on account of the fact that he had wrongly received a sum of

`85,266/- as reimbursement towards medical bills. The reasoning is on the

ground that the payment was made without pre-audit and the excess amount

has been paid. The said communication is in pursuance to the letter dated

29.02.2016 (Annexure P-9) addressed to respondent no. 3.

</p><p id="p_2">            It is the case of the petitioner that the mother of the petitioner

was suffering from breast cancer and had remained admitted in the hospital

from 25.04.2012 to 30.04.2012 and accordingly surgery was conducted on

her and she is suffering from a chronic disease.         It is the case of the

petitioner that before releasing the amount to the petitioner, respondent n o.

2 had granted post facto sanction (Annexure P-4) to all the bills in question

and, therefore, reliance placed upon notification dated 30.12.1985

(Annexure P-10) was not justified.

             A perusal of the impugned communication would go on to

show that admittedly, the amount already stood paid, whether rightly or

wrongly. No show cause notice has been as such issued to the petitioner as

to the grounds for which the amount is now sought to be recovered. A

decision has already been taken vide the letter dated 29.02.2016 which led

to the impugned communication dated 03.03.2016 (Annexure P-8).

Resultantly, the present petition has been filed.

</p><p id="p_4">             Notice of motion.
</p>
<p id="p_5">             Ms. Lavanya Paul, AAG, Punjab accepts notice. Copy of the

writ petition has been supplied to her.
</p>
<p id="p_6">             In view of the above, reply is not felt necessary from the State.

             Accordingly, this Court is of the opinion that before ordering

recovery, at least a show cause notice should have been issued to the

petitioner so that he was in a position to reply and object to the same.

Thereafter, if the objections were found without any basis, an order of

recovery could have been passed. The said procedure having not been

followed, this Court is of the opinion that resort to the procedure followed is

not proper and violates the principles of natural justice as such. It is for

respondent no. 2 to take a decision on this.
</p>
<p id="p_7">             Accordingly, the communication dated 03.03.2016 (Anexure P-

</p><p id="p_8">8) is quashed and it is directed that appropriate show cause notice be issued

to the petitioner and his response to the same be taken.            Thereafter,

respondent no. 2 who had sanctioned the bills, shall take a call on the issue

whether the amount was payable to the petitioner or not. Accordingly, a

speaking order be passed in case the explanation of the petitioner is found

not justified. The said exercise be conducted within a period of 3 months
