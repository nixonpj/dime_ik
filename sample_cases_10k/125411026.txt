Judgment

1.</pre><p id="p_1">     The   suit   filed   on   behalf   of   the   plaintiffs   for   permanent   and 



CS No. 110/09                                                               Page 1 of  5
    mandatory injunction against the defendant is hereby disposed off 

   through this judgment.
</p>
<p id="p_2">2.     The case of the plaintiffs, in brief, is that the plaintiffs and 

   defendant are the co­owners of the property bearing no. 2252, Gali 

   Bari Pahr Wali, Chowk Rali, Nai Sarak, Delhi­06 having different 

   shares in the said property and are in possession of the plaintiffs 

   as shown Green in the site plan annexed with the plaint and the 

   defendant is stated to be in possession of another part as shown 

   Blue   in   the   site   plan   whereas,   the   common   portion   has   been 

   shown in Yellow colour in the site plan.  The property consists of 

   2nd floor also which is open to sky and the dispute arose between 

   the parties with regard to that 2nd floor. The suit was filed by the 

   plaintiffs   herein   for   possession   and   the   2nd  floor   against   the 

   predecessors in interest of the defendant bearing suit no. 245/97 

   titled as Sh. Laxmi Narain &amp; Ors Vs. Niadar Chand which was 

   decreed on 22.10.2007.   The defendant in that suit was to hand 

   over the vacant and peaceful physical possession to the plaintiff 

   but despite the pendency of the execution nothing came out.  

</p><p id="p_3">3.     The plaintiff came to know, that the defendants, in collusion 

   with some persons, was in the process of selling away his share 

   together with the 2nd floor of the property and even removed 90% 


CS No. 110/09                                                         Page 2 of  5
      of   his   goods   and   belongings.     The   attempts   to   hand   over   the 

     possession have been foiled by the plaintiff with the intervention 

     and help of the neighbours on two occasions on 17.03.2009 and 

     20.03.2009.  The plaintiff came to know, that the transaction has 

     been   entered   into   by   the   defendant   for   a   consideration   of   Rs. 

     3,70,000/­.  
</p>
<p id="p_4">4.       The plaintiff apprehends that the purchaser may intrude the 

     privacy of his family which consists of women and children.  The 

     grudge of the plaintiff is that the action of the defendant is illegal 

     for he is not the owner of the property especially the 2nd floor and 

     has no locus standi to sell the same.  Thus, finding no remedy, the 

     instant   suit   was   filed   by   the   plaintiff   seeking   permanent   and 

     mandatory injunction against the defendant seeking therein that 

     the defendant be restrained from parting with the possession of 

     the   2nd  floor   and   creating   any   third   party   interest   in   the   suit 

     property and be also directing through a mandatory injunction  to 

     sell the portion shown Blue in the site plan of the plaintiff.  

</p><p id="p_5">5.       The defendant did not come forward to contest the suit despite 

     service through publication, thus, the plaintiff was called upon to 

     lead the evidence as the defendant was proceeded exparte.

</p><p id="p_6">6.       In support of the case, the plaintiff no. 1 examined himself and 


CS No. 110/09                                                                Page 3 of  5
      thereafter, closed the plaintiff evidence.

</p><p id="p_7">7.       The case was kept for final arguments, however, counsel for 

     plaintiff did not show up to argue the matter despite imposition of 

     cost and today he has not turn up at all and for that matter none 

     appeared through out the day for the plaintiff.

</p><p id="p_8">8.       Thus, on the basis of the material on record, the case of the 

     plaintiff is considered.  The case of the plaintiffs suffers from basic 

     flaw   that   despite   the   claim   of   the   plaintiff   regarding   the 

     ownership/co­ownership   of   the   property,   the   same   could   not   be 

     established   by   the   plaintiff   as   there   is   no   document   on   record 

     which  may  connect  the  plaintiff with the  ownership  of  the   suit 

     property.  Thus, the claim of the plaintiffs sans any documentary 

     proof, which may even remotely suggest that the plaintiffs are the 

     owner of the portions of the suit property as claimed by them or of 

     the 2nf floor the same is of no consequence.  Thus, in the absence 

     of any evidence supporting the claim of the plaintiffs makes the 

     case   filed   by   the   plaintiff   a   rudderless   boat   which   has   no 

     direction/destination and which is bound to be doomed.

</p><p id="p_9">9.       There is no explanation with the plaintiff as to why this suit 

     has been filed when in an earlier suit a decree is there in favour of 

     the plaintiff and for that matter even execution is also pending. 


</p><p id="p_10">CS No. 110/09                                                              Page 4 of  5
   The plaintiff's it seems  could have got the relief sought by them 

  in that execution proceedings itself.
</p>
<p id="p_11">10.   In these circumstances, the court is left with no option but to 

  conclude   that   the   claim   of   the   plaintiffs   is   unfounded, 

  unsupported   and   without   any   basis.     As   a   result,   suit   stands 

  dismissed.     Decree   be   drawn   accordingly.   File   be   consigned   to 

  record room.
