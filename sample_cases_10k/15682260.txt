     15.2.2016 and today, it has emerged that the petitioner / establishment is

     no longer conducting its business or any commercial activity. A Liquidator

     has also been appointed on the establishment, which issue is sub-judice.

<p id="p_9">              2.       Mr. Bagul, learned Advocate submits that the petitioner/

              the respondents to take instructions and make a statement."
</p>   



<p id="p_11">     9.       Shri Magre, learned Advocate submits on instructions from the





     respondents present in the Court, that they are satisfied if retrenchment

     compensation under Section 25-F and gratuity are calculated by this Court,

     deducting the earlier amounts paid. With the said amount to be paid, these





     petitions can be disposed off.

<p id="p_12">     10.      Shri Magre, however, submits that by the purshis filed on 25.3.2011

     before the Labour Court at Dhule, Exhibit C-38, by the petitioner, the

     amount of Rs.74,287.35 Ps. is paid to each of the respondents, towards the

     unpaid wages, current wages, ex gratia amount and bonus.                   He further

     submits that the amount of Rs.26740/- paid to each of the respondents was

     towards retrenchment compensation, notice pay and six months' wages.

     respondents at the rate of Rs.3800/- this Court may quantify an additional




                                                          
     amount as may be paid to these respondents.

<p id="p_14">     11.      Shri    Bagul,       learned   Advocate   has   graciously      submitted,        on

     instructions from the petitioner, that the amount as may be directed by this

     Court would be paid to the respondents, so as to bring this litigation to an

<p id="p_15">     12.      In the light of the above, considering the last drawn wages of the
                            
     respondents and they having put in about 22 years of service with the

     petitioner, the retrenchment compensation as per Section 25-F would be
      


     about Rs.48,231/-. Therefore, the Gratuity amount would be practically
   



     the same at Rs.48,231/-. One month's notice pay, if added, would bring the

     total to 1,00,262/- (inclusive of Gratuity) to be paid to each of the workers.

<p id="p_16">     13.      The amount already paid to the each respondents is Rs.1,01,027/-.

<p id="p_17">     14.      The respondents have fairly stated that Rs.26740/- has already been

     paid to them towards retrenchment compensation and Rs. 74287/- is

     towards outstanding wages, bonus as well as ex gratia.

<p id="p_18">     15.      In the light of the above, I find that a lump sum compensation of

     Rs.50,000/- to be paid to each of the respondents in addition to

     Rs.1,01,027/- having already been paid, would take care of the residual
