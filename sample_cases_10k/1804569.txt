ORAL ORDER</pre> 

 

 


 

<p id="p_1">	The
petition is directed against the order dated 14.10.2010 passed by the
learned first appellate Court whereby the learned first appellate
Court has set aside the order dated 18.08.2010 passed by the learned
trial Court below Exh.5 in Regular Civil Suit No.22 of 2010.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_2">	The
dispute pertains to construction of a building which, allegedly,
would cause disturbances, nuisance to the petitioner and restriction
against enjoyment of his existing property. On the allegation that
the construction is being undertaken contrary to the provisions under
Section 104 of the Panchayat Act and also contrary to the approved
plans, the plaintiff filed R.C.S.No.22 of 2010 wherein the learned
trial Court by order dated 18.08.2010 restrained the defendant from
carrying on further construction work and also restrained the
defendants from selling, transferring, alienating the property in
question in favour of the third party/prospective purchasers of the
property. Aggrieved by the said order, the original defendants
carried the matter in appeal where the learned first appellate Court
has, by the impugned order, vacated the said order dated 18.08.2008
and passed the modified order.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_3">	In
view of the contention raised by the petitioner with regard to breach
of the provisions of Section 104 of the Panchayat Act and
applicability of the Building Rules to the construction of property
and in light of the defence raised by the respondents on the ground
that the Building Rules are not applicable for construction in Gamtal
land, the matter requires consideration. Hence, Office is directed
to issue notice to the respondents, returnable on 18th
November, 2010. Ms. Kapadia,
learned advocate, has waived service of notice qua respondent Nos.1,
2 and 3 since he has entered appearance for the caveators i.e. the
respondent Nos.1, 2 and 3.
</p> 


 


 

<p id="p_4">	In
view of the observations/directions made by the learned first
appellate Court in para 13 of the impugned order, it is directed that
the Officer from the office of City Survey Superintendent shall visit
the suit premises and shall take measurement of the exact distance
between the property being constructed and the existing property of
the petitioner-plaintiff and having regard to the plans approved by
the Panchayat for the building under construction prepare
and submit report stating inter alia as to whether the construction
is as per the plan and rules or not and how much distance is
kept/maintained by the defendants while constructing the disputed
building. He would also include in his report his remarks, as to
whether the construction is in conformity with the approved plan or
not. It would be open to the respondents to raise contentions and
objections against the report, including the contention that the
regulations on which the plaintiff seeks to rely, are not applicable
to the construction in Gamtal area. At the request of the respondent,
it is clarified that the report to be submitted by the Officer would
be in respect of that part of petitioner's property which has common
side with the building under construction and in respect of which the
grievance is made in the suit and description are made in para 13 of
the order. The Officer from the office of City Survey Superintendent
shall complete the exercise and make the report available on or
before 15th
November, 2010. The report will be placed on record through learned
AGP.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_5">	It is
clarified that the concerned Officer from the Office of the City
Survey Superintendent will undertake the aforesaid exercise
independently and without any interference or assistance from either
the plaintiff or the defendant.
</p> 


 


 

<p id="p_6">	Mr.
</p><p id="p_7">Mehta, learned Senior Advocate, for Ms. Kapadia, learned advocate
for the respondent Nos.1, 2 and 3 has assured that until the report
becomes available and is considered by this Court, further
construction will not be
carried on. 
</p>
