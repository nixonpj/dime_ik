                                       ORAL ORDER</pre>
<p id="p_1">         1.     By this application under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_1">Article 227</a> of the Constitution of
         India, the applicant, legal heirs of the deceased Noormiya
         Gulabmiyn call in question the legality and validity of the order
         dated 30.05.2017 passed by the S.S.R.D at Ahmedabad, by
         which, the S.S.R.D rejected the revision application filed by the
         applicants herein, thereby affirming the order of the Collector,
         Ahmedabad dated 19.01.2013.
</p>
<p id="p_2">         2.     The dispute between the parties pertains to a mutation of
         the entry bearing No.4844 in the revenue records dated
         25.09.1954. It appears from the materials on record that one
         Gulabmiya was appointed as a Jividar. I am given to
         understand that the functions of the Jividar, at the relevant
         point of time, were to render the services to the people of the

HC-NIC                                 Page 1 of 4     Created On Thu Sep 14 00:31:11 IST 2017
                C/SCA/12339/2017                                                     ORDER



         village. On account of poor health of Gulabmiya, his son,
         namely, Sultanmiya Gulabmiya was made the Jividar of the
         village.    The respondent No.4 herein is the widow of late
         Sultanmiya Gulabmiya, whereas the applicants herein are the
         heirs of Noormiya Gulabmiya. Norrmiya and Sultanmiya were
         the brothers. On Sultanmiya being made the Jividar of the
         village, an entry in this regard came to be mutated in the
         record of rights dated 24.09.1954 bearing No.4844. When
         Gulabmiya was appointed as the Jividar, certain parcels of the
         land were allotted to him in lieu of the services which were
         being rendered as the Jividar. On his son, late Sultanmiya,
         being appointed as the Jividar, it appears that all those lands
         were, thereafter, derived by Sultanmiya. The case of the
         applicants herein is that the respondent No.4, being the widow
         of Sultanmiya, could not be said to be solely entitled to the
         lands in question allotted at the relevant point of time. Late
         Noormiya also had an equal right, title and interest in those
         parcels of the land. The dispute, ultimately, gave rise to the
         RTS    proceedings       before     the     revenue            authorities.           The
         applicants     have failed before both the revenue authorities,
         i.e., the Collector as well as the S.S.R.D. They have essentially
         failed on the ground of delay in questioning the revenue
         entries.

              character and possession of the land in question."
</p>
<p id="p_5">         4.   The applicant No.1/2 is personally present in the Court.
</p><p id="p_6">         5.   Mr. Rana, the learned counsel submits that he would not
         like to press this petition on merits as his clients have already
         filed a Special Civil Suit No.235 of 2015 in the court of the
         learned Principal Civil Judge, Bavla, District: Ahmedabad for
         partition and injunction.     The suit is pending, as on date,
         between the parties and the clients of Mr. Rana would like to
         pursue with the remedy of the suit, which they have already
         availed. Mr. Rana submits that many parcels of the land have
         been disposed of by the respondent No.4 over a period of time,
         and it is apprehended that whatever is left, is also likely to be
         disposed of.
</p>
<p id="p_7">         6.   The plaintiffs have filed an application Exh.5 praying for
         injunction. I am informed by Mr. Rana that, till this date, the
         Exh.5 application has not been taken up for hearing.
</p>
<p id="p_8">         7.   This petition is disposed of as not pressed. However, the
         civil court concerned is directed to take up the Exh.5
         application for hearing at the earliest and pass an appropriate
         order in accordance with law after hearing both the sides. The
         Exh.5 application shall be disposed of with order within a
         period of six weeks from the date of the receipt of the writ of
         this order. It is needless to clarify that the Exh.5 application
         shall be decided by the civil court on its own merits without
         being influenced, in any manner, by any of the observations
         made by the revenue authorities.            Notice is discharged. The
         ad-interim order, earlier granted, stands vacated.
