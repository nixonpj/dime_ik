              In all these petitions, the Municipal Council has challenged the

     judgments and orders of the Industrial Court, Jalgaon delivered in the
                            
     Complaints filed by the respondents invoking items 5, 6 and 9 of Schedule IV

     of the Maharashtra Recognition of Trade Unions and Prevention of Unfair
      


     Labour Practices Act, 1971 ("the said Act "). Since, there is no dispute as
   



     regards the complaints filed and the judgments delivered by the Industrial

     up all the matters together for a hearing by the consent of the learned

     all these petitions shall be referred to as the "Municipal Council" and the

     Municipal Council, Sawda, Tq. Raver, District Jalgaon Vs. Madhusudan

     Narayan Patil and others in Writ Petition Nos. 4557 to 4559 of 2005, has

     these three petitions, this Court, (Coram : B.P.Dharmadhikari, J.) has

     observed from paragraph No. 17 to 24 as under:-
</p>



                                          
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">              "17.
</blockquote>                             
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">                       As already noted above, the findings of unfair labour practice
              under Item 9 of Schedule IV is reached because of denial of equal
              pay for equal work. The judgment reported at "State of Haryana &amp;
                            
              Another V/s Tilak Raj &amp; others (Supra), shows that the daily wager
              can not invoke such doctrine. The reliance upon said concept
              therefore by Industrial Court is misconceived.
</blockquote>      
   



<blockquote id="blockquote_3">              18.      It is true that the Industrial Court has not directed Municipal
              Council to absorb the complainants before it on any particular posts
              or to pay them wages in particular pay scale and has also not asked





              it to create post. It has only directed it to pay salary and
              consequential benefits like that of permanent employee. How in
              absence of posts/vacancies the said benefit can be directed to be
              extended, has not been explained by the respondents. In case of





              "Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation and Anr V/s
              Casteribe Rajya P. Karmchari Sanghatana (Supra)" in paragraph
              no.27, the Hon'ble Apex Court has noted observations made by it
              in its earlier judgment reported at "Mahatma Phule Agricultural
              University and Others V/s Nasik Zilla Sheth Kamgar Union and
              others (Supra)". In paragraph no. 13, the Hon'ble Apex Court has
              found that a thing which could not have been done directly, can not
              be done indirectly.

              judgments. Perusal of judgment in the case of "Municipal Council,
              Hinganghat V/s Sanjay Dhanraj Yenorkar (Supra)" shows that there




                                                     
              defence of employer-Municipal Council was of employment under a
              particular scheme and its closure in 1995. In that background, this
              Court has found that nothing prevented that petitioner from




                                                    
              tendering oral as well as documentary evidence before Industrial
              Court to substantiate this contentions. The reliance also being
              placed on the judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court reported at




                                         
              "(1996)2 SCC 293" (Chief Conservator of Forests V/s Jagannath
              Maruti Kondhare), where the Hon'ble Apex Court has found that
                             
              burden was upon the employer to show absence of intention or
              object on its part to deprive the employees working on daily wages
                            
              of their benefits of permanency. Again it is to be noted that the
              employer was of Forest Department of State Government and it
              therefore had necessary powers to sanction or create posts. That is
      

              not the position in the present facts. This judgment is also
              distinguished by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of "Gangadhar
   



              Pillai V/s Siemens Ltd.," reported at (2007) 1 SCC 533. The
              judgment of the learned Single Judge reported in the case of

              in this matter. In      "2001(1) Bom.C.R. 753" (National Textile
              Corporation (NM) Limited V/s Shivaji Gopal Gorule (Shri) and





              others), this Court has found that existence of vacancies was not in

              required to consider defence of private employer that employees
              were not in its employment but were private hands engaged by its

     based on the number of posts created. The competent authorities can take
      

     a decision with regard to the date from which regularisation can be

     representation to the Municipal Council and the Government to reconsider
