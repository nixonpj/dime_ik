was   going   on   motorcycle   bearing   No.DL­6SAR­1158   along   with   a   friend 

namely Shri Dheeraj and the vehicle was driven by the injured/ petitioner as 

per traffic rules and regulations and on proper way and correct side of the 

road and carefully. They were going from Inderpuri to Connaught Place, New 

Delhi   to   attend   a   marriage   ceremony.   During   the   said   process   when   the 

injured/   petitioner   reached   "Near   Ramlila   Ground   Main   Road   Todapur,

without blowing any horn and without giving indicator and hit the motorcycle 

with   very   great   force.   Due   to   the   forceful   impact   the   petitioner/   injured   fell 

down on the road and received multiple grievous injuries along with his friend. 

The   petitioner   was   removed   to   RML   Hospital,   New   Delhi   where   MLC   was 

prepared by the doctors of the concerned hospital. It was contended that the 

accident occurred due to rash and negligent manner of the respondent No.1 

who was driving the offending vehicle at the time of the accident in a rash and 

negligent act and due to his act an innocent person became the victim of the 

same.   It   was   stated   that   in   respect   of   the   accident   FIR   No.49/15   under

the FIR was got registered only on 27.2.2015. However it is seen that the DD is 

dated 25.2.2015 and as such the police had information about the accident 

soon after the accident. Further the complainant in the FIR itself had stated 

that on the day of the accident he had not given any statement due to pain

cannot be said that the delay in lodging the FIR was such as would vitiate the

admitted that he was driving the motorcycle. He denied the suggestion that the 

accident had taken place due to his negligence. Thus PW1 stated that he had 

drunk beer prior to the accident. It was argued  on  behalf of the insurance 

company that the petitioner had consumed alcohol at the time of the accident 

and dashed the motorcycle against the alleged offending vehicle. A perusal of 

the MLC of the petitioner shows that alcohol was present in the breath of the 

petitioner but there is nothing to show that any sample of the blood was taken 

to test for the quantity of alcohol in the blood of the petitioner. There is also 

nothing to show that the quantity of alcohol was so high that the petitioner 

would not have been able to control the motorcycle. Further the MLC of the 

respondent No.1 also shows the presence of alcohol.

that the front right side rim was damaged and the tyre was torn and chimta 

and shocker were damaged, front right side body was damaged, front bumper 

and jali were damaged and the right side headlight and indicator were broken. 

The mechanical  inspection report of the  motorcycle of the petitioner shows 

that right side handle and brake pedal and spot and foot rest and chassis were 

damaged, chain cover was damaged, back number plate was damaged as 

also the mudguard, seat and battery cover were broken and the right side leg 

guard was damaged and the front and back indicators were broken. Thus the 

involvement of the offending vehicle in the accident cannot be disputed. It was 

stated in the FIR that the offending vehicle had come from the opposite side 

and hit the motorcycle of the petitioner from the side and the site plan also 

shows that the accident had taken place on the side of the petitioner. As such 

there is nothing to show contributory negligence on the part of the petitioner. 

The respondent No.1 who is the driver and owner of the offending vehicle has 

not adduced any evidence to dispute the version put forth by the petitioner or 

in the criminal record. The criminal record has been placed on record which

                  person. In case of personal injury the position is different from

<p id="p_52">The case of the petitioner is that due to the accident on 25.2.2015 he fell down 

on   the   road   and   received   multiple   grievous   injuries.   The   petitioner   was 

removed to RML Hospital, New Delhi where MLC was prepared by the doctors 

of   the   concerned   hospital.   It   was   submitted   that   due   to   the   accident   the 

petitioner   received   multiple   grievous   injuries   and   other   specific   injuries   and 

wounds, swelling and pain on different parts of the body. It was averred that 

the   petitioner   was   not   doing   any   work   because   pain   and   suffering   was 

continuing in his body till date and he was not well till date because pain and 

suffering was continuing in his body till date. It was contended that due to the 

accident the petitioner and his family members suffered from mental pain and 

agony,   loss   of   income,   loss   of   works,   loss   of   enjoyment,   loss   of   social 

activities, loss of general or special damages, etc. The petitioner stated that he 

received   grievous   injuries   and   pelvis   fracture   right   side   and   of   second 

metatarsal bone. After the accident, he was removed to RML Hospital, New 

Delhi where the MLC was prepared by the doctors of the concerned hospital. 

Thereafter he was removed to Behl Hospital where his operation was done 

and   rod   was   inserted.   He   stated   that   two   times   he   was   admitted   from 

27.02.2015 to 03.03.2015 and 09.03.2015 to 10.03.2015. He stated that he had 

become a disabled person and he received disability. He stated that he could 

not walk fast and received disfigurement. He could not sit and stand in proper

shows the injuries sustained by the petitioner and as per the same nature of 

injuries was opined to be grievous. The documents placed on record show that 

the   petitioner  had   suffered   fracture   of   pelvis  right   side   and   fracture   of   2nd 

metatarsal   base.   The   documents   also   show   that   he   remained   admitted   in 

hospital. However there is nothing to show that the petitioner had sustained 

any disability in the accident. Looking at the nature of injuries and extent of 

treatment  and  that  the   accident  pertains  to  the   year  2015,  the  petitioner  is 

awarded Rs.30,000/­ (Rs.Thirty Thousand only) for pain and suffering.



</p><p id="p_54">20.        The petitioner was 28 years of age at the time of the accident and it was 

so stated in the claim petition. Copy of DL of the petitioner is on record as 

Ex.PW1/7 as per which the date of birth of the petitioner is 10.4.1987. As such 

he would have been more than 27 years old on the date of the accident i.e. 

25.2.2015.   Notice   can   be   taken   of   the   fact   that   on   account   of   the   injuries 

sustained by him the petitioner may not have been able to perform his day to 

day duties towards his family and on account of the injuries suffered by him 

the petitioner may not have been able to enjoy the amenities of life. In the 

circumstances   the   petitioner   is   awarded   a   sum   of   Rs.10,000/­   (Rs.Ten 

Thousand only) for loss of amenities of life. The petitioner cannot however be 

held to be entitled to any amount towards loss of expectation of life or towards 

disfiguration.

petitioner   had   placed   on   record   bills   towards   ambulance   charges   for   an 

amount of Rs.5,800/­ though one bill is not dated. Notice can be taken of the 

fact   that   after   the   accident   the   petitioner   was   taken   to   RML   Hospital   and 

thereafter   to   Behl   Hospital   and   that   after  discharge   from  hospital   he   might 

have hired the services of private conveyance as he would not have been able

attendant   charges,   however   looking   to   the   nature   of   injuries   the   petitioner

LOSS OF INCOME



</p><p id="p_63">24.        It is the case of the petitioner that at the time of accident he was 28 

years old and was doing his self­business of Videography and was earning 

Rs.30,000/­ per month which was handsome income to run his family but due 

to the accident he was on bed rest and long treatment and he lost his income 

and suffered from heavy loss of income as well as expenses on treatment 

which   were   continuing   till   date.   The   petitioner   in   para   4   of   his   affidavit 

Ex.PW1/A had deposed to that effect. He stated that after the accident his 

work was stopped due to long time treatment and he was suffering economic 

problem. He stated that he was on bed rest for 4­5 months and he could not 

work   properly,   therefore,   he   was   facing   great   financial   losses   and   other 

irreparable   losses.   However   the   petitioner   has   not   placed   on   record   any

During cross­examination by the learned counsel for the insurance company 

PW1 stated that he had not placed on record any proof of his income. He 

denied the suggestion that he was not earning Rs.20,000/­ to Rs.30,000/­ p.m. 

He stated that he had one brother. He denied the suggestion that he had not 

taken leave on account of his injuries. He denied the suggestion that he did 

not suffer any financial loss on account of the accident. Thus PW1 himself 

stated that he had not placed on record any proof of his income. As such there 

is nothing to show that the petitioner was earning Rs.20,000/­ to Rs.30,000/­ 

per month at the time of the accident. During examination by the Tribunal the 

petitioner stated that he was 25 years old. He stated that at the time of the 

accident he was working as a photographer and was earning Rs.15,000/­ to 

Rs.20,000/­ per month.

</p><p id="p_66">25.        The petitioner had stated that he remained on bed rest for 4­5 months 

but the petitioner has not produced any document to show that he remained 

on bed rest for any particular period and there is nothing to show that he was 

advised bed rest for any particular period or that on account of the injuries 

sustained in the accident he was unable to work or to show the period for 

which he was not able to work except one document advising bed rest for 10 

days.   There   is  also   nothing   to   show   that  he   remained   on  bed   rest  for  4­5

acquired any disability on account of the accident or that he is likely to suffer 

future loss of income on account of the injuries sustained in the accident and 

that   the   injuries  would   reduce   his efficiency  to   work  and   thereby  he   would 

suffer loss of future income. Accordingly the petitioner cannot be held entitled
