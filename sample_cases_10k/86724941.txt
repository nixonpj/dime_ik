<p id="p_10">    3.     The counsel for the petitioner states that the accused had

    joined the investigation as and when the Investigating Officer so


    directed him. Learned Additional Advocate General did not dispute

    this averment.
</p>

<p id="p_11">    4.     FACTS:
</p>
<p id="p_12">           The gist of the First Information Report and the investigation is as




    follows:
</p>




<blockquote id="blockquote_1">                (i)       That     on 10.10.2019 complainant Sanjay Kumar

                informed the Police Station Hamirpur that one person having





                mobile No. 98829-44542 has circulated an obscene photo in

                the Whatsapp Group of G.P. Khiah               on 3.10.2019 and

                demanded action against the said person.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">                (ii)   On the basis of this information, the aforementioned FIR

                was registered against the petitioner.
</blockquote>



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                               ::: Downloaded on - 31/10/2019 20:24:20 :::HCHP</span>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                            3</span>




<p id="p_13">    5.    REASONING:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">              (i) I have seen the print out of the photo which was allegedly




                                                                   .
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">              uploaded by the petitioner. Undoubtedly the photograph is

              vulgar, immoral and anti-social and it does not be-hove for a





              person who is a senior citizen to indulge in such acts. However,

              the people especially senior citizens are unable to cope with the

              changing technology and sometimes by mistake can trigger the





              send command. Even otherwise the custodial interrogation is

              not going to serve any purpose nor does any pre-trial

              incarceration.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">              (ii) The petitioner had joined the investigation.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">              (iii) In the status report, there is no mention of previous criminal


              history of the bail petitioner.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_7">              (iv) The petitioner is a permanent resident of address mentioned




              in the memo of parties. Therefore, his presence can always be





              secured.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_8">              (v) I am satisfied that no purpose will be served if the bail





              petitioner is sent to judicial custody.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_9">              (vi) I am of the considered view that, prima facie, petitioner has

              made out a case for grant of bail. His custodial interrogation is

              not required at all.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_14">    6.    In the result the present petition is allowed. In the event of arrest of

    the petitioner, he shall be released on bail, in connection with the above

<blockquote id="blockquote_17">           (g)    In case the petitioner is put to the trial, then the petitioner

           such Court.r
