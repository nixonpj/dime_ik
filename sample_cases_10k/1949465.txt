s. 21, applicability.



HEADNOTE:
     <a href="/doc/1818930/" id="a_5">Section  2</a>	  of  the  Part	 States	 (Laws)	 Act,  1950,
empowered the  Central Government  to extend by notification
in the official gazette, to any Part C State, or to any part
of it, with such restrictions and modifications as it thinks
fit, any  enactment in force in a Part A State. In 1951, the
Central Government, in exercise of this power, extended by a
Notification the  Bengal Finance  (Sales Tax)  Act, 1941, to
the then  Part State  of Delhi with certain modifications in
s. 6.  The section, after such extension with modifications,
provided:
	  6(1) No tax shall be payable under this Act on the
	       sale of	goods specified	 in the first column
	       of the  Schedule subject	 to  the  conditions
	       etc: and
	   (2)	The State  Government  [Amended	 as  Central
	       Government   in	 1956]	 after	 giving	  by
	       notification in the official gazette not less
	       than 3  months notice  of its intention to do
	       so, may	by like	 notification add to or omit
	       from or	otherwise  amend  the  Schedule	 and
	       thereupon  the	Schedule  shall	 he  amended
	       accordingly
     A modified Schedule of goods exempted from tax under<a href="/doc/792189/" id="a_6"> s.
6</a> was  also substituted	 for the  original Schedule  in	 the
<a href="/doc/792189/" id="a_7">Bengal Act</a>, by the Notification.
     After the	passing of  the <a href="/doc/1211891/" id="a_8">States	Reorganisation	Act</a>,
1956, the  <a href="/doc/1439698/" id="a_9">Part States	(Laws) Act</a>  became <a href="/doc/1544448/" id="a_10">Union Territories
(Laws) Act</a>, 1950. with necessary adaptations.
     In 1957,  the Central  Government issued a Notification
in purported  exercise of the powers under<a href="/doc/792189/" id="a_11"> s. 2</a> of the 1950-
Act,  amending	 the   1951-Notification.   By	 the   1957-
Notification an	 additional modification  of <a href="/doc/792189/" id="a_12"> s.  6</a>  of	 the
Bengal Act  was introduced  in the 1951-Notification, namely
the words  "such previous notice as it considers reasonable"
were substituted  for the  words "not  less than  3  months'
notice" in<a href="/doc/792189/" id="a_13"> s. 6(2)</a>.
     In 1959,  Parliament  passed  the	Bengal	(Sales	Tax)
(Delhi Amendment)  Act,	 1959,	making	some  amendments  in
various sections of the <a href="/doc/792189/" id="a_14">Bengal Act</a> but left<a href="/doc/792189/" id="a_15"> s. 6</a> untouched.
     By various	 notifications, exemption from sales tax was
granted	 to   several  commodities.  but  subsequently,	 the
exemption was  withdrawn by other notifications after giving
notice of less than 3 months.
     Dealers in those commodities, who were aggrieved by the
withdrawal of the exemption, challenged the validity of' the
withdrawal. The High Court dismissed their petitions. On the
main ground that Parliament, while enacting the <a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_16">Amending Act</a>
of 1959,  had put  its seal  of approval  to  the  curtailed
period of  notice in<a href="/doc/792189/" id="a_17"> s. 6(2)</a> and as such, it should be taken
to have	 keen provided	by Parliament  itself in  the <a href="/doc/792189/" id="a_18">Bengal
Act</a>.
786
     Allowing the appeals to this Court,
^
     HELD: The	1957-Notification purporting  to  substitute
the words  "such previous notice as it considers reasonable"
for the words 'not less than 3 months' notice" in<a href="/doc/792189/" id="a_19"> s. 6(2)</a> of
the  Bengal  Act,  is  beyond  the  powers  of	the  Central
Government,  conferred	 on  it,   by <a href="/doc/917293/" id="a_20"> s.  2</a>  of  the  Union
Territories  (Laws)  Act,  1950;  and  in  consequence,	 the
various	 notifications,	  in  so   far	as  they  with	drew
exemptions from tax with respect to the several commodities,
are invalid  and ineffective, as the exemption was withdrawn
without complying with the mandatory requirement of not less
than 3 months' notice enjoined by the section. [808-D-E]
     (1) (a) The primary power bestowed by<a href="/doc/917293/" id="a_21"> s. 2</a> of the Union
Territories (Laws)  Act, 1950,	on the Central Government is
one of	extension, that	 is,  bringing	into  operation	 and
effect, in  a Union Territory, an enactment already in force
in a  State. The discretion conferred by the section to make
"restrictions and  modifications" in the enactment sought to
be extended,  is not a separate and independent power, which
can be	exercised apart	 from the power of extension, but is
an integral  constituent of  the power of extension. This is
made clear  by the use of the preposition "with" one meaning
of which  (which accords  with the  context) is "part of the
same whole". [801 E-F]
     (b) There	are 3 limits on the power given by<a href="/doc/792189/" id="a_22"> s. 2</a>. (i)
The power  exhausts itself on extension of the enactment. It
can  be	  exercised  only   once,  simultaneously  with	 the
extension  of	the  enactment,	  but  cannot  be  exercised
repeatedly or subsequently to such extension. (ii) The power
cannot be  used for  a purpose other than that of extension.
In the	exercise of  the power,	 only such  restrictions and
modifications can  be validly  engrafted  in  the  enactment
sought to  be extended, which are necessary to bring it into
operation and  effect in  the Union Territory. Modifications
which are not necessary for, or ancillary and subservient to
the purpose  of extension,  are not  permissible. And.	Only
such modifications  can be  legitimately necessary  for such
purpose, as  are required  to adjust,  adapt, and  make	 the
enactment suitable  to the  peculiar local conditions of the
Union Territory	 for carrying  it into operation and effect.
(iii) The  words "restrictions	and  modifications"  do	 not
cover such  alterations as involve a change in any essential
feature of  the enactment  or the  legislative policy  built
into it. [801G-H, 802A]
     (c) If  the words	"such restrictions and modifications
as it  thinks fit" are given the wide construction of giving
an unfettered  power of amending and modifying the enactment
sought to  be extended,	 as contended by the respondent, the
validity of the section itself becomes vulnerable on account
of the	vice  of  excessive  delegation.  Moreover.  such  a
construction would  be repugnant  to the context and content
of the section, read as a whole. [802 <a href="/doc/133811/" id="a_23">B-C]
     Rajnarain Singh  v. The  Chairman Patna  Administration
Committee Patna</a>	 [1955] 1 S.C.R. 291 and Re: <a href="/doc/1925530/" id="a_24">Delhi Laws Act</a>,
[1951] S.C.R. 747, referred to.
     (2) The  1957-Notification transgresses these limits in
two respects :
     (a) The  power has not been exercised contemporaneously
with the  extension or	for the purposes of the extension of
the <a href="/doc/792189/" id="a_25">Bengal  Act</a> to Delhi but 6.6 years thereafter. The power
of  extension	with  restrictions   and  modifications	 had
exhausted itself  when the  <a href="/doc/792189/" id="a_26">Bengal Act</a> was extended to Delhi
with some alterations by the 1951-Notification. [802D-E]
     The power	given under <a href="/doc/792189/" id="a_27"> s. 2</a> of the 1950-Act, cannot be
equated to  the "Henry	VIII clause"  of  the  Acts  of	 the
British Parliament because while the power under<a href="/doc/792189/" id="a_28"> s. 2</a> can be
exercised only	once when  the Act  is extended,  the  power
under a	 "Henry VIII  clause" can  be invoked,	if there  is
nothing contrary  in the  clause,  more	 than  once  on	 the
arising of a difficulty when the Act is operative [802F-H]
     Observations of  Fazal Ali,  J. at	 p. 850 in Re: <a href="/doc/1925530/" id="a_29">Delhi
Laws Act</a> case explained.
787
     (b) The  alteration sought	 to be introduced in<a href="/doc/792189/" id="a_30"> s. 6(2)</a>
by the	1957-Notification  goes	 beyond	 the  scope  of	 the
"restrictions and  modifications" permissible  under<a href="/doc/792189/" id="a_31"> s. 2</a> of
the 1950-Act,  because, it  purports to change the essential
features of <a href="/doc/792189/" id="a_32"> s. 6(2)</a>  and the  legislative  policy  inherent
therein. [803F]
     <a href="/doc/792189/" id="a_33">Section 6(2)</a> before the issue of the 1957-Notification,
requiring the  Government to  give "not	 less than 3 months'
notice" of its intention to add to or omit from or otherwise
amend	the   Schedule	 to   the   1950-Act,	embodies   a
determination of  legislative policy  and its formulation as
an absolute  rule of'  conduct could  be diluted, changed or
amended only  by the  legislature, in  the exercise  of	 its
essential legislative function, which could not be delegated
to the Government. [803G-804E, F, G]
     (i) The  language of  the sub-section  as it  stood  is
emphatically prohibitive  and it  commands the Government in
unambiguous negative  terms that the period of the requisite
notice must  not be  less than	3 months,  showing that	 the
provision was mandatory and not directory. [804-A-B]
     (ii) The scheme of the <a href="/doc/792189/" id="a_34">Bengal Act</a> is that the tax is to
be quantified  and assessed  on the  quarterly turnover. and
the period of not less than 3 months, notice conforms to the
scheme and  ensures that  the imposition  of a	new  tax  of
exemption does not cause dislocation or inconvenience either
to the dealer or the Revenue. [804B]
     (iii) By  fixing the  period at not less than 3 months,
purchasers on  whom the	 incidence of  tax really falls have
adequate notice of taxable items. [804-C]
     (iv) Dealers  and others  likely to  be affected  by an
amendment of  the  Schedule  get  sufficient  time  to	make
representations and adjust their affairs. [804-D]
     The  span	of  notice  was	 thus  the  essence  of	 the
legislative mandate. The necessity of notice and the span of
notice both  are integral to the scheme of the provision and
it cannot  be split  up	 into  essential  and  non-essential
components, the whole of it being mandatory. [804-<a href="/doc/1113126/" id="a_35">E-F]
     Raza Buland  Sugar Co. Ltd. v. Municipal Board, Rampur</a>,
[1965] 1 S.C.R. 970, distinguished.
     (3)(a) <a href="/doc/797174/" id="a_36">Pt.	 Benarsi  Das  Bhanot  v.  State  of  Madhya
Pradesh</a> [1959]	2 S.C.R. 427 does not assist the respondent.
That was  a case  where the  contention that  5. 6(2) of the
C.P. &amp;	Bihar Sales Tax Act, 1947, was invalid on the ground
of excessive  delegation, was rejected, by the Court. In the
present case, it is the validity of a Notification purported
to be issued under<a href="/doc/792189/" id="a_37"> s. 2</a> of the 1950-Act that is impeached as
beyond the  powers of modification conferred by the section.
[804H, 805A]
     (b) In the present case, the Central Government did not
directly  amend	<a href="/doc/792189/" id="a_38"> s.  6(2)</a>.  More  than	6  years  after	 the
extension of  the Act  by the  1951-Notification, it amended
the   sub-section   indirectly	 by   amending	 the   1951-
Notification. But  on the extension of the Act to Delhi, the
1951-Notification  had	 exhausted  its	  purpose,  and	 the
purported amendment,  through the  medium of  such a  "dead"
Notification  is   an  exercise	  in  utility.	Further,  an
amendment which	 was not  directly permissible	could not be
done indirectly. [805-B, C]
     (4) The  High  Court  was	in  error  in  holding	that
Parliament had	validated or  re-enacted referentially, with
retroactive effect,  what was sought to be done by the 1957-
Notification when it passed the <a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_39">Amending Act</a>, 1959. [807C]
     <a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_40">The Amending  Act</a> leaves<a href="/doc/792189/" id="a_41"> s. 6(2)</a> untouched. It does not
even  indirectly  refer	 to  the  1957-Notification  or	 the
amendment purportedly made by it in<a href="/doc/792189/" id="a_42"> s. 6(2)</a>. Nor does it re-
enact or  validate what	 was sought  to be  achieved by that
notification. No  indication of referential incorporation or
validation of  the 1957-Notification or the amendment sought
to be  made by it, is available either in the Preamble or in
any other  provision of the <a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_43">Amending Act</a>. Parliament despite
its presumed  awareness of  the 1957-Notification,  has said
nothing in  the <a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_44">Amending  Act</a> indicating  that it has in any
manner incorporated, re-enacted or
788
validated the  1957-Notification or  the amendment sought to

     (6)  The	respondent  cannot   contend  that   if	 the
withdrawal of  exemption without giving 3 months" notice was
illegal, then  the  grant  of  exemption  without  giving  3
months' notice was also void. [808-A]
     (a) Some  of the  goods were  granted exemption  by the
1951-Notification itself and, hence, there is no question of
giving notice for giving those exemptions. [807-G]
     (b)  The	validity  of   the  notifications   granting
exemptions after the extension of the Act to Delhi is not in
issue  in  the	writ  petitions.  and  whether	or  not	 the
requisite notice  was given  before granting  exemption is a
question of fact depending on evidence. [807G]
     (c) To  allow the	respondent to take such a plea would
be  violative	of  the	 fundamental  principle	 of  natural
justice, according  to which  a party  cannot be  allowed to
take advantage of his own lapse or wrong. [807--H]
     (7) The  respondent cannot	 also rely  on<a href="/doc/141478/" id="a_47"> s.  21</a> of the

amend the Schedule to the 1950-Act. is<a href="/doc/792189/" id="a_48"> s. 6(2)</a> of the Bengal
Act and	 not<a href="/doc/141478/" id="a_49"> s. 21</a> of the General Clauses Act, and the power

<p id="p_33">     Finding on	 all the  four grounds in favour of the writ
petitioners, lie  learned Single  Judge declared  "that	 the
purported modification	of S.  6(2) of	the  Bengal  Finance
(Sales-Tax)  Act   1941	 by   the  Government	of   India's
notification No.  SRO 3908,  dated 7th	December, 1957,	 was
ineffective and	<a href="/doc/792189/" id="a_75"> s. 6(2)</a>  continues to be the same as before
as if  it was  not so  modified at  all." In  consequence he
quashed the  Government notifications  GSR 964,	 dated 16-6-
1966 and  GSR 1061  dated 29-6-1966 because they were not in
compliance with	 the requirement  of<a href="/doc/792189/" id="a_76"> s.	 6(2)</a> of  the Bengal
Act.
</p><p id="p_34">     The contentions  canvassed before	the  learned  Single
Judge were  repeated before  the appellate Bench of the High
Court. The  Bench did not pointedly examine the scope of the
power of  modification given  to the  Central Government  by
s. 2  of the <a href="/doc/476269/" id="a_77">Laws Act</a> with specific reference to the purpose
for which  it was  conferred and its precise limitations. It
did not	 squarely dispel the reasoning of the learned Single
Judge that  the power of modification is an integral part of
the power  of extension	 and "cannot  therefore be exercised
except for  the purpose	 of the	 extension". It	 refused  to
accept that  reasoning with  the  summary  remark-"from	 the
extracts  quoted  by  the  learned  Single  Judge  from	 the
judgment of the Supreme Court in Re: <a href="/doc/1925530/" id="a_78">Delhi Laws Act</a> and from
the Judgment  in  <a href="/doc/1501218/" id="a_79">Rajnarain  Singh  v.	The  Chairman  Patna
Administration	Committee   Patna  and	Anr</a>.  the  principle
deduced by  the learned	 Judge does not appear to follow. We
are therefore not inclined, as at present advised to support
the above observations". The Bench however hastened to add :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_21">	  "However, since the matter was not argued at great
     length  and   the	appellants'   Counsel	rested	 his
     submissions on  the other aspects of the case, we would
     not like to express
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">794</span>
     any definite  opinion on the question as to whether the
     power of  making any  modifications or  restrictions in
     the Act  can only be exercised at the time of extending
     the Act  and that it cannot be done subsequently by the
     Central Government in exercise of its power."</blockquote>

<a href="/doc/1113126/" id="a_80">Raza Buland  Sugar Co.	Ltd. v.	 Municipal Board, Rampur</a>,(1)
the Bench  held that  what is  mandatory in <a href="/doc/792189/" id="a_81"> s. 6(2)</a>  is the
requirement as	to the	giving of  reasonable notice  of the
Government's intention	t(! amend  the second  Schedule, for
the  information   of  the  public,  and  that	"no  special
significance or	 sanctity is attached to the span of time of
three months  provided in subsection (2) of<a href="/doc/792189/" id="a_82"> s. 6</a>." The Bench
found that  since  the	withdrawals  of	 the  exemptions  in
question, had  been made  after reasonable  notice, the same
were not invalid.
</p><p id="p_36">     However, the  main ground	on which the decision of the
Bench rests  is that  the infirmity, if any, in the impugned
notification dated  7-12-1957, had  been cured and rectified
when "Parliament while enacting the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_83">Amendment Act</a>, 1959 (Act
No. '70	 of 1959)  put its seal of approval to the curtailed
period of  notice. As  such the	 curtailed period  of notice
shall be  taken to  have been  provided by Parliament on the
ratio of  Supreme Court's  decision  in	 Venkatrao  Esajirao
limberkar's case".

the learned  Counsel for  the appellants have tried to raise
before us another ground under the garb of what they styled.
as  merely   an	 additional  argument".	 They  now  seek  to
challenge the  vires of	 the Notification SRO 615, dated the
28th April, 1951 in so far as it relates to the insertion in
sub-section (2)	 of<a href="/doc/792189/" id="a_84"> s. 6</a> of that Act, between the words "add
to" and	 "the Schedule",  of the words "or omit or otherwise
amend". It  is argued  that this  insertion was	 beyond	 the
power of modification conferred on the Central Government by
s. 2  of the  <a href="/doc/476269/" id="a_85">Laws Act</a>.	 The point  sought to be made out is
that if	 the insertion	made by the Notification dated 28-4-
1951, in sec. 6(2) was ineffective and non est in the eye of
law, the  Central Government  would have  no power to "omit"
anything from  the exempted  goods itemised in the Schedule.
It is  argued that  under<a href="/doc/792189/" id="a_86"> s.  6(2)</a> sans	 this insertion, the
Central Government  was empowered  only to  "add to" and not
"omit" from  the exempted  items enumerated in the Schedule,
and  consequently,  the	 withdrawal  of	 the  exemptions  in
question was ultra vires the Central Government.
</p><p id="p_38">     The entertainment of this Plea at this stage is stoutly
opposed by Shri B. Sen, learned Counsel for the Revenue.
</p><p id="p_39">     We are  not inclined to permit the appellants to add to
the list  of impugned  Notifications, now in section appeal.
In their  writ petitions,  the appellants  did not challenge
the validity  of the  Notification dated 28-4-51. They never
raised this point before the learned
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">795</span>
Single Judge.  Of course,  before the  appellate  Bench,  an
argument was addressed on this point, but it does not appear
to have been pressed. The Bench noted:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_22">	  "In the present appeal, the <a href="/doc/792189/" id="a_87">Bengal Act</a> as extended
     by SRO  615, dated	 the 28th April 1951, did not suffer
     from any  infirmity. It  is  conceded  by	the  learned
     Counsel  for  the	      respondent  that	the  Central
     Government at  the time  it extended  e the <a href="/doc/792189/" id="a_88">Bengal Act</a>,
     was  competent   to  introduce  such  modification	 and
     restrictions as it thought fit."
</blockquote><p id="p_40">The certificate	 under <a href="/doc/1325025/" id="a_89">Art.  133</a>  of  the  Constitution	 was
neither sought,	 nor granted  on  any  ground  touching	 the
validity of  the Notification,	dated 28-4-1951. In the face
of all this, it is now too late for the appellants to commit
a volte	 face. Accordingly, we decline to entertain this new
ground of challenge.
</p><p id="p_41">     The learned Counsel for the parties have, more or less,
reiterated the	same contentions  which they had advanced in
the High Court.
</p><p id="p_42">     On behalf	of the	appellants, it is contended that the
power of modification conferred on the Central Government by
s. 2 of the <a href="/doc/476269/" id="a_90">Laws Act</a> is not an unfettered power of delegated
legislation but a subsidiary power conferred for the limited
purpose of  extension and  application to a Union Territory,
an enactment in force in a State. It is maintained that only
such modifications  are permissible  in the exercise of that
power which are necessary to adapt and adjust such enactment
to local conditions.
</p><p id="p_43">     According to Shri Ashok Sen, the power given by<a href="/doc/792189/" id="a_91"> s. 2</a> is
a power	 of conditional	 legislation which is different from
the power  of delegated legislation. It is submitted that it
is not	a recurring  power; it exhausts itself on extension,
and in	no case	 this power  can be used to change the basic
scheme and  structure of  the enactment	 or the	 legislative
policy ingrained  in it. The submission is that the impugned
notification, dated  7-12-1957, is  bad because	 it has been
issued more than 61 years after the extension of <a href="/doc/792189/" id="a_92">Bengal Act</a>,
and it	attempts to  change the re- rquirement of<a href="/doc/792189/" id="a_93"> s. 6(2)</a> as
to "not	 less than  three months  notice"  which  P  is	 the
essence of the whole provision.
</p><p id="p_44">     Reference has  been made to this Court's opinion in Re:
<a href="/doc/1925530/" id="a_94">Delhi Laws  Act</a> (supra) and the decision in Raj Narain Singh
case (supra).
</p><p id="p_45">     Shri Ashok Sen further submits that by the amending Act
20 of  1959, parliament	 did not put its seal of approval on
the impugned  notification or  the changes sought to be made
by it  in<a href="/doc/792189/" id="a_95"> s.  6</a> of  the Bengal	Act. It is stressed that the
amending Act  of 1959,	did  not  touch	<a href="/doc/792189/" id="a_96"> s.  6</a>	at  all	 and
therefore  it	could  not  be	said  with  any	 stretch  of
imagination, that  Parliament had referentially or impliedly
incorporated or	 approved the  purported change	 made by the
impugned notification, in the <a href="/doc/792189/" id="a_97">Bengal Act</a>.
</p><p id="p_46">     As against	 the above, Shri B. Sen, the learned Counsel
for the	 Revenue submits that the impugned notification does
not change the essential structure or the policy embodied in
s. 6(2) of the <a href="/doc/792189/" id="a_98">Bengal Act</a>.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">796</span>
<p id="p_47">According to  Counsel, the policy underlying<a href="/doc/792189/" id="a_99"> s. 6(2)</a> is that
reasonable notice of the Government's intention to add to or
omit anything  from the	 Second Schedule  must be  given  by
publication in	the official  Gazette. It is maintained that
the requirement	 as to	"not less than three months' notice"
in the	section was not a matter of policy but one of detail
or expedience;	it was	only directory, and the modification
made  by   the	impugned  notification	did  not  go  beyond
adjusting and  adapting it to the local conditions of Delhi.
Bengal, it  is pointed	out, is a big, far-flung State while
the  Territory	of  Delhi  is  a  small,  compact  area	 and
therefore, it would not be necessary or unreasonable to give
a notice  of less  than three  months for every amendment of
the Schedule.  Reliance has  been  placed  on  this  Court's
dictum in Raza Buland Sugar Co.'s case (supra). It is argued
that the  power to  add or  omit from  the  Second  Schedule
conferred on  the  Government  is  in  consonance  with	 the
accepted practice  of the  Legislature; that it is usual for
the legislature	 to leave  a discretion	 to the executive to
determine details  relating to the working of taxation laws,
such as	 the selection	of persons  on whom the tax is to be
levied or  rates at  which it is to be charged in respect of
different classes  of goods and the like. Reference has been
made to	 the observations  of this  Court in <a href="/doc/797174/" id="a_100">Pt. Benarsi Das
Bhanot v.  State of Madhya Pradesh</a> in the context of s. 6(2)
of the Central Provinces and Berar Sales Tax Act 1947.
</p><p id="p_48">     Shri  B.	Sen  further  contends	that  the  power  of
modification given by<a href="/doc/789287/" id="a_101"> s. 2</a> of the Laws Act, does not exhaust
itself	on   first  exercise;	it  can	 be  exercised	even
subsequently if	 through oversight or otherwise, at the time
of extension  of the  enactment the Central Government fails
to adapt  or  modify  certain  provisions  of  the  extended
enactment for  bringing it  in accord with local conditions.
In  this   connection  support	has  been  sought  from	 the
observations of	 Fazal Ali J. at p. 850 of the Report in Re:
<a href="/doc/1925530/" id="a_102">Delhi Laws  Act</a> (supra). Our attention has also been invited
to<a href="/doc/141478/" id="a_103"> s.  21</a> of  the General  Clauses Act	which  according  to
Counsel, gives	power to  the Central  Government to add to,
amend, vary or rescind any notification etc. if the power to
do so  does not run counter to the policy of the legislature
or affect any change in its essential features.
</p><p id="p_49">     Learned  Counsel  has  further  tried  to	support	 the
reasoning of  the appellate  Bench of  the High	 Court, that
whatever  infirmity   may  have	  existed  in  the  impugned
notification and  the modification made there by in<a href="/doc/792189/" id="a_104"> s. 6(2)</a>,
it was	rectified and cured by Parliament when it passed the
<a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_105">Amendment Act</a>  20 of  1959. It	is urged that the <a href="/doc/792189/" id="a_106">Bengal Act</a>
together with the modifications made by notifications, dated
28-4-51, and  7-12-1957, must  have been  before  Parliament
when it considered and passed the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_107">Amendment Act</a> of 1959. Our
attention has  been invited  to its preamble which is to the
effect: "<a href="/doc/792189/" id="a_108">An  Act</a> further to amend the Bengal Finance (Sales-
Tax) Act,  1941, as  in force  in  the	Union  Territory  of
Delhi," and  also to  the words	 "as in	 forcer in the Union
Territory of  Delhi" in<a href="/doc/792189/" id="a_109"> s. 2</a> of the amending Act. :Reference
has  been  made	 to  this  Court's  decisions  in  Venkatrao
Esajirao's case	 (supra), and Gwalior Rayon Silk Mfg. (Wvg.)
Co. Ltd. The Assistant Commissioner of Sales-tax and ors.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">797</span>
<p id="p_50">     An alternative argument advanced by Shri B. Sen is that
if in <a href="/doc/792189/" id="a_110"> s. 6(2)</a>	the requirement	 as to	"not less than three
months' notice"	 was mandatory	and a  matter of legislative
policy, then  the exemptions  from tax	granted to  Durries,
pure silk  etc. after  the issue o the impugned notification
must be	 treated non est and void ab initio, inasmuch as the
amendments of  the Second  Schedule whereby those exemptions
were  granted,	 were  made   without  complying   with	 the
requirement of	not less  than three  months' notice". It is
argued that  if this  requirement was  a sine  qua  non	 for
amendment of  the Second  Schedule, it	could not be treated
mandatory in  one situation  and directory in another. If it
was mandatory  then compliance	with it	 would be absolutely
necessary both	for granting an exemption and withdrawing an
exemption from tax. In this view of the matter, according to
Shri B.	 Sen, the  withdrawal of  the exemption	 through the
impugned   notification	   was	 a   mere   formality;	 the
notifications simply  declared the  withdrawal of  something
which did  not exist  in the  eye of  law. Appellants cannot
therefore have	any cause  of grievance	 if the	 invalid and
still-born  exemptions	were  withdrawn	 by  the  questioned
notifications.
</p><p id="p_51">     In reply to this last argument, learned Counsel for the
appellants submit  that	 this  ground  of  defence  was	 not
pleaded by  the Revenue	 in its affidavit before the learned
Single Judge. This, according to the Counsel, was a question
of fact	 which required	 evidence for its determination, and
was therefore  required to be pleaded. Since the Respondents
did not	 do so, they should not have been allowed to take it
for the first time at the time of arguments. Even otherwise-
proceeds the  argument-the Respondents	are not competent to
take this  stand which	is violative  of the  basic canon of
natural justice,  according to which no party can be allowed
to take	 advantage of its own wrong. It is stressed that the
object of  the requirement  of not  less than  three months'
notice, was to afford an opportunity to persons likely to be
adversely affected  to raise objections against the proposed
withdrawal or  curtailment of  an exemption  from tax.	That
being the  case, only  the persons  aggrieved could have the
necessary locus	 standi to complain of a non-compliance with
this requirement.
</p><p id="p_52">     In	 Re:  Delhi  Laws  (supra)  this  Court	 inter	alia
examined the constitutional validity of<a href="/doc/789287/" id="a_111"> s. 2</a> of the Laws Act
in the	light of  general principles relating to the nature,
scope and limits of delegated legislation.
	  <a href="/doc/792189/" id="a_112">Section 2</a> as it then stood, was as follows:
</p><p id="p_53">	  "The Central	Government may,	 by notification  in
     the official  Gazette, extend  to any Part State (other
     than Coorg	 and the  Andaman and Nicobar Islands) or to
     any part  of such	State  with  such  restrictions	 and
     modifications as  it thinks  fit any enactment which is
     in force  in  a  Part  A  State  at  the  date  of	 the
     notification and provision may be made in any enactment
     so	 extended  for	the  repeal  or	 amendments  of	 any
     corresponding law	(other than  a <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_113">Central Act</a>) which is
     for the time being applicable to that Part State."
     The Court	by a  majority held  that the  first part of
this section which empowers the Central Government to extend
to any	Part State  or to  any part  of such State with such
modifications and restrictions as it
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">798</span>
thinks fit  any enactment  which is  in force  in a  Part  A
State, is  intra vires,	 and that  the latter  part of	this
section	 which	empowers  the  Central	Government  to	make
provision in  any enactment  extended to  a Part  State, for
repeal or  amendment of	 any law  (other than a <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_114">Central Act</a>)
which is  for the  time being applicable to that Part State,
is ultra  vires. Consequent  upon this	opinion, the  latter
part of the section was deleted by<a href="/doc/1417139/" id="a_115"> s. 3</a> of the Repealing and
<a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_116">Amending Act</a>,  195 (Act	 XLVIlI of  1952) with	effect	from
2-8-1951.
</p><p id="p_54">     The majority  opinion in  upholding the validity of the
first portion  of<a href="/doc/789287/" id="a_117"> s. 2</a> of the Laws Act drew a good deal from
the observations  of the  Privy Council	 in Queen  v.  Burah
wherein it was said:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_23">	  "If what  has been  done is legislation within the
	  general scope	 of the affirmative words which give
	  the power  and if it violates no express condition
	  or restrictions  by which  that power is limited..
	  it is	 not for  any court  of justice	 to  enquire
	  further  or	to  enlarge   constructively   those
	  conditions and restrictions".
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_24">	  x		   x		     x
	  "Where plenary  powers of  legislation exist as to
	  particular subjects,	whether in an Imperial or in
	  a  Provincial	 Legislature,  they  may  (in  their
	  Lordships  judgment)	be  well  exercised,  either
	  absolutely	or     conditionally.	 Legislation
	  conditional on the use of particular powers, or on
	  the exercise of a limited discretion, entrusted by
	  the legislature  to  persons	in  whom  it  places
	  confidence, is  no uncommon  thing;  and,  in	 any
	  circumstances it may be highly convenient."</blockquote>
<p id="p_55">	  (emphasis supplies)
     Before proceeding	further, it  will be proper to say a
few words in regard to the argument that the power conferred
by <a href="/doc/789287/" id="a_118"> s.	2</a>  of  the  Laws  Act  is  a  power  of	 conditional
legislation and not a power of delegated legislation. In our
opinion, no  useful purpose  will be  served to	 pursue this
line of	 argument because the distinction propounded between
the  two   categories  of   legislative	 powers	  makes	  no
difference, in principle. In either case, the person to whom
the power  is entrusted	 can do	 nothing beyond	 the  limits
which circumscribe the power; he has to act-to use the words
of  Lord   Selborne-"within  the   general  scope   of	 the
affirmative  words   which  give   the	power"	and  without
violating any  "express conditions  or restrictions by which
that power is limited". There is no magic in a name. Whether
you call  it the power of "conditional legislation" as Privy
Council called	it in  Burah's case  (supra)  or  'ancillary
legislation' as	 the Federal  Court termed it in Choitram v.
Commissioner   of    Income-tax,   Bihar    or	 'subsidiary
legislation'  as  Kania	 C.J.  styled,	it  or	whether	 you
camouflage it  under the  veiling name of 'administrative or
quasi-legislative  power'-as  Professor	 Cushman  and  other
authorities have done it-necessary for
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">799</span>
bringing into  operation and  effect an	 enactment, the fact
remains	 that	it  has	  a  content,  howsoever  small	 and
restricted of  the law	making power  itself. There is ample
authority in  support of  the proposition  that the power to
extend and  carry into operation an enactment with necessary
modifications and adaptations is in truth and reality in the
nature of  a power  of delegated  legislation. In  Re: <a href="/doc/1925530/" id="a_119">Delhi
Laws Act</a> (supra) S.R. Das J. said that on strict analysis it
was "nothing  but a  delegation of  a fractional legislative
power".	  Anglin J.  in Grays  case regarded  this  what  is
called conditional  legislation' as  "a very common instance
of limited  delegation. More  or less  to the same effect is
the view  taken by  Evatt J.  of Australia  in Dignams case.
Prof. Kennedy  (vide his  treatise 'Constitution of Canada',
2nd Edn.  p. 463),  is also  of	 opinion  that	'conditional
legislation' is "a form of delegation".

</p><p id="p_58">     This question  has to  be answered	 in the light of the

concerned, Fazal  Ali J.  explained the	 scope of  the words

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_25">     "These are not unfamiliar words and they are often used
     by	 careful   draftsmen  to   enable  laws	  which	 are
     applicable to  one place  or object to be so adapted as
     to apply to another. The power of introducing necessary
     restrictions and  modifications is	 incidental  to	 the
     power to  apply or adapt the law, and in the context in
     which the provision as to modification occurs it cannot
     bear  the	 sinister  sense   attributed  to   it.	 The
     modifications are	to be  made within  the framework of
     the Act  and they	cannot be  such	 as  to	 affect	 its

     discretion to  make suitable  changes, but	 it would be
     useless to	 give an  authority the power to adapt a law

     Vivian Bose J. also observed in a similar strain, at p.
     1124;
</blockquote><span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">800</span>
<blockquote id="blockquote_26">     "The power to "restrict and modify" does not import the

     another and  to bring it into harmony with laws already
     in being  in the State, or to delete portions which are
     meant solely  for another	area. To alter the essential
     character of  an  Act  or	to  change  it	in  material
     particulars is  to legislate,  and	 that,	namely,	 the

<p id="p_60">     Mukherjea J.  was	of  the	 view  that  the  "essential

choosing of  the legislative policy and of formally enacting
that policy  into a  "binding rule  of	conduct"  cannot  be
delegated.  Dealing  with  the	construction  of  the  words
"restrictions" and  "modification"  in	the  <a href="/doc/476269/" id="a_125">Laws  Act</a>,	 the

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_27">     "The  word	  "restrictions"  ..   connotes	  limitation
     imposed on a particular provision so as to restrain its

     me that  in the  context and  used alongwith  the	word
     "restriction"  the	  word	"'modification"	  has	been
     employed also  in a  cognate sense,  and  it  does	 not
     involve any  material or  substantial  alteration.	 The
     dictionary meaning	 of the expression "to modify" is to
     "tone down"  or to "soften true rigidity, of the thing"
     or	 "to   make  partial  changes  without	any  radical
     alteration". It  would be quite reasonable to hold that

<p id="p_63">     Bearing in	 mind  the  principles	and  the  scope	 and
meaning of  the expression  "restrictions and modifications"
explained in <a href="/doc/1925530/" id="a_136">Delhi Laws Act</a>, let us now have a close look at
s. 2.  It will	be clear  that the primary power bestowed by
the section  on the Central Government, is one of extension,
that is,  bringing into	 operation and	effect, in  a  Union
Territory, an  enactment already  in force  in a  State. The
discretion conferred  by the  Section to  make 'restrictions
and modifications'  in the  enactment sought to be extended,
is not	a separate  and independent power. It is an integral
constituent  of	 the  powers  of  extension.  It  cannot  be
exercised  apart  from	the  power  of	extension.  This  is
indubitably  clear   from  the	 preposition  "with"   which
immediately  precedes  the  phrase  "such  restrictions	 and
modifications" and  conjoins it	 to the	 principal clause of
the section which gives the power of extension. According to
the Shorter  Oxford Dictionary,	 one  meaning  of  the	word
"with", (which	accords here  with the context), is "part of
the same whole".
</p><p id="p_64">     The power given by<a href="/doc/792189/" id="a_137"> s. 2</a> exhausts itself on extension of
the  enactment;	  it  cannot   be  exercised  repeatedly  or
subsequently to	 such extension.  It can  be exercised	only
once, simultaneously  with the	extension of  the enactment.
This  is   one	dimension  of  the  statutory  limits  which
circumscribe the  power. The second is that the power cannot
be used	 for a	purpose other than that of extension. In the
exercise  of   this  power,   only  such  "restrictions	 and
modifications" can  be validly	engrafted in  the  enactment
sought to  be extended, which are necessary to bring it into
operation and effect in the Union Territory. "Modifications"
which are not necessary for, or ancillary and subservient to
the purpose
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">802</span>
of  extension,	 are  not   permissible.  And,	 only	such
"modifications"	 can  be  legitimately	necessary  for	such
purpose as  are required  to  adjust,  adapt  and  make	 the
enactment suitable  to the  peculiar local conditions of the
Union Territory	 for carrying  it into operation and effect.
In the	context of  the section, the words "restrictions and
modifications" do  not cover  such alterations	as involve a
change in  any essential  feature, of  the enactment  or the
legislative  policy   built  into  it.	This  is  the  third
dimension of the limits that circumscribe the power.
</p><p id="p_65">     It	 is  true  that	 the  word  "such  restrictions	 and
modifications as  it thinks fit", if construed literally and
in isolation,  appear to  give unfettered  power of amending
and modifying  the enactment  sought to	 be extended. Such a
wide construction must be eschewed lest the very validity of
the section  becomes vulnerable	 on account  of the  vice of
excessive delegation. Moreover, such a construction would be
repugnant to  the context  and the  content of	the section,
read as	 a whole,  and the  statutory limits  and conditions
attaching to  the exercise of the power. We must, therefore,
confine	 the   scope  of   the	 words	 "restrictions	 and
modifications" to alterations of such a character which keep
the inbuilt  policy, essence  and substance of the enactment
sought to  be extended,	 intact,  and  introduce  only	such
peripheral or  insubstantial changes  which are	 appropriate
and necessary to adapt and adjust it to the local conditions
of the Union Territory.
</p><p id="p_66">     The    impugned	notification,	 dated	  7-12-1957,
transgresses the  limits which	circumscribe the  scope	 and
exercise of  the power conferred by<a href="/doc/789287/" id="a_138"> s. 2</a> of the Laws Act, at
least, in two respects.
</p><p id="p_67">     Firstly,	the    power   has    not   been   exercised
contemporaneously with	the extension or for the purposes of
the extension of the <a href="/doc/792189/" id="a_139">Bengal Act</a> to Delhi. The power given by
s. 2  of the  <a href="/doc/476269/" id="a_140">Laws Act</a>	had exhausted itself when the <a href="/doc/792189/" id="a_141">Bengal
Act</a>  was  extended,  with  some	 alterations,  to  Delhi  by
Notification dated  28-4-1951. The impugned notification has
been issued  on 7-12-1957,  more than  6 1/2-years after the
extension.
</p><p id="p_68">     There is  nothing in the opinion of this Court rendered
in Re:	<a href="/doc/1925530/" id="a_142">Delhi Laws  Act</a> (supra)	 to  support  Mr.  B.  Sen's
contention that	 the power  given by <a href="/doc/792189/" id="a_143"> s. 2</a>  could be validly
exercised within  one year after the extension. What appears
in the	opinion of  Fazl Ali  J. at  page 850,	is merely  a
quotation from	the report  of the  Committee on  Minister's
Powers which  considered the  propriety of  the	 legislative
practice of  inserting a  "Removal of  Difficulty Clause" in
Acts of	 British Parliament,  empowering  the  executive  to
modify the  Act itself	so far	as necessary for bringing it
into operation.	 This device  was adversely  commented upon.
While some  critics conceded  that this	 device is "partly a
draftsman's insurance  policy, in  case	 he  has  overlooked
something" (e.g.  Sir Thomas  Carr,  page  44  of  his	book
"Concerning English  Administrative  Law"),  others  frowned
upon it,  and nicknamed	 it as "Henry VIII Clause" after the
British Monarch	 who  was  a  notorious	 personification  of
absolute despotism.  It was  in this  perspective  that	 the
Committee on  Minister's Powers	 examined this	practice and
recommended:
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">803</span>
<blockquote id="blockquote_32">	  ".... first,	that the  adoption of  such a clause
     ought on each occasion when it is, on the initiative of
     the  Minister  in	charge	of  the	 Bill,	proposed  to
     Parliament to  be justified  by him upto the essential.
     It can  only be  essential for  the limited  purpose of
     bringing  an   Act	 into	operation  and	 it   should
     accordingly be  in most  precise language restricted to
     those purely  machinery arrangements  vitally requisite
     for that  purpose; and the clause should always contain
     a maximum	time-limit of one year after which the power
     should lapse".</blockquote>
<p id="p_69">     It may  be seen  that the time-limit of one year within
which  the  power  under  a  Henry  VIII  Clause  should  be
exercisable, was  only	a  recommendation,  and	 is  not  an
inherent attribute of such power. In one sense, the power of
extension-cum-modification given  under<a href="/doc/789287/" id="a_144"> s. 2</a> of the Laws Act
and the power of modification and adaptation conferred under
a  usual   'Henry  VIII	  Clause,'  are	 kindred  powers  of
fractional legislation,	 delegated by the legislature within
narrow circumscribed  limits. But  there is  one significant
difference between  the two.  While the power under<a href="/doc/792189/" id="a_145"> s. 2</a> can
be exercised  only once when the Act is extended, that under
a 'Henry VIII Clause' can be invoked, if there is nothing to
the contrary in the clause-more than once, on the arising of
a difficulty  when the Act is operative. That is to say, the
power under  such a  Clause  can  be  exercised	 whenever  a
difficulty arises  in the  working  of	the  Act  after	 its
enforcement, subject  of course	 to the	 time-limit, if any,
for its exercise specified in the statute.
</p><p id="p_70">     Thus, anything  said in  Re: <a href="/doc/1925530/" id="a_146">Delhi Laws Act</a> (supra), in
regard to  the time-limit  for the exercise of power under a
'Henry VIII  Clause', does  not hold good in the case of the
power given  by<a href="/doc/789287/" id="a_147"> s.  2</a> of  the Laws Act. Fazl Ali J., did not
say anything  indicating that  the power  in question can be
exercised within one year of the extension. On the contrary,
the learned  Judge expressed  in unequivocal  terms, at page
849:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_33">     "<a href="/doc/792189/" id="a_148">Once the	Act</a>  became  operative	any  defect  in	 its
     provision cannot  be removed until amending legislation
     is passed."</blockquote>
<p id="p_71">     Secondly, the  alteration sought  to be  introduced  by
this Notification  (7-12-1957) in <a href="/doc/792189/" id="a_149"> s. 6(2)</a>,  goes beyond the
scope of  the 'restrictions  and modifications'	 permissible
under<a href="/doc/789287/" id="a_150"> s.  2</a> of	the Laws  Act; it  purports  to	 change	 the
essential  features   of  sub-s.   (2)	of <a href="/doc/792189/" id="a_151"> s.	6</a>.  and	 the
legislative policy inherent therein.
</p><p id="p_72">     <a href="/doc/792189/" id="a_152">Section  6(2)</a>,  as	 it  stood  immediately	 before	 the
impugned notification, requires the State Government to give
by Notification	 in the	 Official Gazette  "not less  than 3
months notice"	of its	intention to  add to or omit from or
otherwise amend	 the Second Schedule. The primary key to the
problem	 whether  a  statutory	provision  is  mandatory  or
directory, is the intention of the law-maker as expressed in
the law,  itself. The  reason behind  the provision may be a
further aid  to the  ascertainment of that intention. If the
legislative intent  is expressed  clearly  and	strongly  in
imperative words,  such as  the use  of	 'must'	 instead  of
"shall", that will itself be sufficient to hold
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">804</span>
the provision  to be mandatory, and it will not be necessary
to pursue  the enquiry	further. If the provision is couched
in prohibitive	or  negative  language,	 it  can  rarely  be
directory, the use of peremptory language in a negative form
is per	se indicative of the intent that the provision is to
be mandatory  (Crawford, the  Construction of  Statutes	 pp.
523-24). Here  the language  of sub-section  (2) of <a href="/doc/792189/" id="a_153"> s. 6</a> is
emphatically prohibitive,  it  commands	 the  Government  in
unambiguous negative  terms that the period of the requisite
notice must not be less than three months.
</p><p id="p_73">     In fixing this period of notice in mandatory terms, the
legislature had,  it seems  taken into consideration several
factors. According  to the scheme of the <a href="/doc/792189/" id="a_154">Bengal Act</a>, the tax
is quantified  and assessed  on the  quarterly turnover. The
period of not less than three months notice conforms to that
scheme and  is intended	 to ensure  that imposition of a new
burden or  exemption from  tax causes  least dislocation and
inconvenience to  the dealer  in collecting  the tax for the
Government, keeping accounts and filing a proper return, and
to the Revenue in assessing and collecting the same. Another
object of this provision is that the public at large and the
purchasers on  whom the	 incidence of  the tax really falls,
should have  adequate notice  of taxable  items.  The  third
object seems  to be that the dealers and others likely to be
affected by  an amendment  of the  Second Schedule  may	 get
sufficient time	 and opportunity for making representations,
objections  or	 suggestions  in  respect  of  the  intended
amendment. The	dealers have also been ensured adequate time
to arrange  their sales	 adjust their  affairs	and  to	 get
themselves registered  or get  their  licenses	amended	 and
brought in accord with the new imposition or exemption.
</p><p id="p_74">     Taking  into   consideration  all	these  matters,	 the
legislature has in its judgment solemnly incorporated in the
statute, fixed	the period  of the  requisite notice as "not
less than  three months"  and willed  this obligation  to be
absolute. The  span of	notice was  thus the  essence of the
legislative mandate. The necessity of notice and the span of
notice both are integral to the scheme of the provision. The
sub-section cannot  therefore be split up into essential and
non-essential components,  the whole  of it being mandatory.
The rule  in  Raza  Buland  Sugar  Co.'s  case	(supra)	 has
therefore no application.
</p><p id="p_75">     Thus  <a href="/doc/792189/" id="a_155">section   6(2)</a>  embodies   a	  determination	  of
legislative policy  and its  formulation as an absolute rule
of conduct  which could	 be diluted, changed or amended only
by  the	  legislature  in  the	exercise  of  its  essential
legislative function  which could  not, as held in Re: <a href="/doc/1925530/" id="a_156">Delhi
Laws  Act</a>  (supra)  and	 Rajnarainsingh's  case	 (supra)  be
delegated to the Government.
</p><p id="p_76">     For these	reasons we  are of  opinion that the learned
single Judge of the High Court was right in holding that the
impugned notification  was  outside  the  authority  of	 the
Central Government as a delegate under<a href="/doc/789287/" id="a_157"> s. 2</a> of the Laws Act.
</p><p id="p_77">     Before proceeding	further,  we  may  mention  here  in
passing that  the point for decision in Benarsi Das Bhanot's
case (supra)  relied on	 by the	 Division Bench	 of the High
Court, was different from the one
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">805</span>
before us.  There, the constitutional validity of s. 6(2) of
the Central   Provinces	 and Berar  Sales Tax Act, 1947, was
questioned on  the ground  of excessive	 delegation. In	 the
instant case  the validity  of<a href="/doc/792189/" id="a_158"> s. 6(2)</a> of the Bengal Act, as
such is not being impeached.
</p><p id="p_78">     There is  yet another  facet  of  the  matter.  By	 the
impugned  notification,	  the  Central	Government  did	 not
directly seek  to amend	<a href="/doc/792189/" id="a_159"> s. 6(2)</a>. Perhaps it was not sure of
its competence	to do  so more	than 6	1/2 years  after the
extension of  <a href="/doc/792189/" id="a_160">Bengal Act</a>  to Delhi.  It therefore  chose  to
amend<a href="/doc/792189/" id="a_161"> s.  6(2)</a>	indirectly  through  the  amendment  of	 its
earlier notification dated 28-4-51, which was only a vehicle
or instrument  meant for  extension of	the  <a href="/doc/792189/" id="a_162">Bengal  Act</a>  to
Delhi. On such extension, the notification had exhausted its
purpose and  had spent	its force.  It had  lost its utility
altogether as  an instrument  for modification of the <a href="/doc/792189/" id="a_163">Bengal
Act</a>. Therefore, the issue of the impugned notification which
purported to  amend<a href="/doc/792189/" id="a_164"> s.	6(2)</a> through  the medium of a "dead"
notification, was  an exercise	in futility. In any case, an
amendment which	 was not  directly permissible	could not be
indirectly smuggled in through the back-door.
</p><p id="p_79">     We now turn to the main ground on which the judgment of
the appellate  Bench of	 the High  Court rests. The question
is, was the invalidity from which the impugned notification,
dated 7-12-1957, suffered cured by the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_165">Amendment Act</a> of 1959
? The  Bench seems  to think  that by passing this <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_166">Amendment
Act</a>, Parliament	 had put  its seal of approval on the <a href="/doc/792189/" id="a_167">Bengal
Act</a> as it stood extended and amended by the Notifications of
1957 and 1957.
</p><p id="p_80">     We find  no basis	for this surmise. <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_168">This Amendment Act</a>
leaves<a href="/doc/792189/" id="a_169"> s. 6(2)</a> untouched; it does not even indirectly, refer
to the	impugned notification  or the  amendment purportedly
made by it in<a href="/doc/792189/" id="a_170"> s. 6(2)</a>. Nor does it re-enact or validate what
was sought  to be  achieved by the impugned Notification. No
indication of referential incorporation or validation of the
impugned notification  or the amendment sought to be made by
it, is	available either  in the  preamble or  in any  other
provision of the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_171">Amendment Act</a>.
</p><p id="p_81">     <a href="/doc/1590934/" id="a_172">In Krishna Chandra v. Union of India</a>,(1) relied upon by
the learned  Counsel for  the Respondents, the central issue
for consideration  was, whether R. 20(2) framed by the Bihar
Government under<a href="/doc/671947/" id="a_173"> s. 15</a> of the Mines and Minerals (Regulation
and <a href="/doc/1515277/" id="a_174">Development)  Act</a>, 1957  and the  second proviso  to  s.
10(2)  of   the	 Bihar	 Land	Reforms	  Act,	 1950	were
constitutionally valid.	 By the	 combined operation of these
statutory provisions,  the petitioners	therein were  called
upon to	 pay certain rent and royalties in respect of mining
operations. Those  demands were challenged in <a href="/doc/1752601/" id="a_175">Baijnath Kedia
v. State  of Bihar</a>(2) wherein this Court held that the Bihar
legislature had	 no jurisdiction to enact the second proviso
to<a href="/doc/1175287/" id="a_176"> s.  10(2)</a> of	 the Bihar  Act because<a href="/doc/115407457/" id="a_177"> s. 15</a> of the Central
Act, read  with<a href="/doc/792189/" id="a_178"> s.  2</a> thereof,	had appropriated  the  whole
field  relating	  to  mining   minerals	 for   Parliamentary
legislation. The  upshot of  that  decision  was,  that	 the
action taken by the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">806</span>
Bihar Government  in modifying	the terms  and conditions of
the leases which were in existence anterior to the Rules and
the levy  sought to  be made  on the strength of the amended
<a href="/doc/1054471/" id="a_179">Bihar Act</a>  and Rule, were unsustainable. Thereupon the State
persuaded Parliament  to enact	the <a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_180">Validation	Act</a> of	1969
with a	view to remove the road-blocks which resulted in the
decision  in   Kedia's	case   (supra).	 <a href="/doc/87571198/" id="a_181">Section  2</a>  of	 the

</p><p id="p_84">     The High  Court has  tried with the aid of this Court's
decision in  Venkatrao v.  State of  Bombay (supra) to spell
out the	 proposition that  mere amendment  of an  Act  by  a
competent legislature, amounts to re-enactment of the parent
Act. We find nothing in this Court's decision in Venkatrao's
case which warrants the enunciation of such a sweeping rule.
All that was decided in Venkatrao's case was that the assent
given by  the President	 to the <a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_190">Amending Act</a> would be deemed
to be  an assent  accorded to  the  parent  Act,  also.	 The
decision in  Venkatrao's case therefore does not advance the
case of Shri B. Sen.
</p><p id="p_85">     Shri   B.	 Sen's	 alternative   argument	  that	 the
notifications whereby  the exemptions  from  tax  have	been
withdrawn in  regard to	 Durries, pure	silk, country liquor
etc.  are  not	assailable  because  those  exemptions	were
earlier granted	 without giving	 three	months'	 notice,  is
manifestly unsustainable.
</p><p id="p_86">     Firstly, so  far as  fruits, fresh	 and dried (item 8),
Pepper, tamarind and chillies (item 11), Turmeric (item 14),
ghee (item 16), and knitting wool, (item 21A) are concerned,
they were  exempted goods in the Schedule of the Bengal Act,
as modified  and extended  by the  Notification, dated 28-4-
1951, to  Delhi. No  question of  giving notice for granting
these exemptions  therefore arose. Secondly, the validity of
the notifications  whereby exemptions  were granted  to pure
silk, liquor  etc. after  the extension of the <a href="/doc/792189/" id="a_191">Bengal Act</a> to
Delhi is  not in  issue. This  plea was	 not set  up by	 the
Respondents in	their affidavits.  Whether or not notice for
the requisite  period was given before issuing the exemption
notifications, was a question of fact depending on evidence.
Thirdly, to  allow the	Respondents to	take their  stand on
such a	plea would be violative of the fundamental principle
of natural  justice, according	to which,  a party cannot be
allowed to  take advantage  of its  own lapse  or wrong. The
statute
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">808</span>
has imposed  a peremptory  duty on  the Government  to issue
notice of  not less  than three	 months, of its intention to
amend the Second Schedule. It therefore cannot be allowed to
urge that  since it had disobeyed this mandate on an earlier
occasion when  it granted the exemptions it can withdraw the
exemptions in  the same unlawful mode. Two wrongs never make
a right.
</p><p id="p_87">     Nor could	the  Respondents  derive  any  authority  or
validity from <a href="/doc/141478/" id="a_192"> s. 21</a>  of the  General Clauses  Act, for	 the
notifications withdrawing  the exemptions.  The source	from
which the  power to  amend the	Second Schedule, comes is<a href="/doc/792189/" id="a_193"> s.
6(2)</a> of	 the Bengal Act and not<a href="/doc/141478/" id="a_194"> s. 21</a> of the General Clauses
Act. <a href="/doc/792189/" id="a_195">Section  21</a>, as  pointed out by this Court in Gopichand
v.  Delhi   Administration(1)  embodies	  only	a   rule  of
construction and  the nature  and extent  of its application
must be	 governed by  the relevant statute which confers the
power to  issue the notification. The power therefore had to
be exercised  within the limits circumscribed by<a href="/doc/792189/" id="a_196"> s. 6(2)</a> and
for the purpose for which it was conferred.
</p><p id="p_88">     For all  the foregoing  reasons, we are of opinion that
the impugned  notification, dated  7-12-1957, purporting  to
substitute the	words "such  previous notice as it considers
reasonable" for	 the  words  "not  less	 than  three  months
notice" in<a href="/doc/792189/" id="a_197"> s. 6(2)</a> of the Bengal Act is beyond the powers of
the Central  Government, conferred on it by<a href="/doc/789287/" id="a_198"> s. 2</a> of the Laws
Act. In	 consequence, the notification dated 1-4-1958, 19-9-
1959, 29-6-1966 and 31-7-1970 in so far as they withdrew the
exemptions from	 tax in	 the case  of  Durries,	 pure  silk,
country	 liquor,   kirayana  articles  etc.  were  withdrawn
without complying with the mandatory requirement of not less
than three  months notice  enjoined by<a href="/doc/792189/" id="a_199"> s. 6(2)</a> of the Bengal
Act, are also invalid and ineffective.
</p><p id="p_89">     In the  result we	allow these  appeals, set  aside the
judgment of  the appellate  Bench  of  the  High  Court	 and
declare the Notification dated 7-12-1957, and the subsequent
notifications in so far as they withdrew the exemptions from
tax,  mentioned	  above,  to  be  unconstitutional.  In	 the
circumstances of  the case,  we leave  the parties  to	bear
their own costs.
