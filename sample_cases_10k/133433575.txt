JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">The claimants in a fatal road accident case in MCOP.No.848 of 1998 on the file of MACT, Tiruvannamalai, having felt aggrieved by the quantum of compensation awarded by  the Tribunal, have preferred this appeal. 
</p>
<p id="p_2">2. On 15.5.1998, at about 2.45 a.m. one Jayapalan was travelling as a passenger in an auto rickshaw along with two others from Tiruvannamalai to Thandarampet. While so, a van bearing No.TN32-Z-3259 belonging to the first respondent and insured with second respondent dashed against the auto, thanks to the negligence of the driver of the van, owing to which Jayapalan died and other two passengers suffered injuries.  Claiming a compensation of Rs.10,00,000/-, Jayapalan's wife Prema, his four daughters and his son have moved the Tribunal.  Assessing the evidence before it, the Tribunal had passed an award for Rs.5,05,768/- and directed its payment with interest at 7.5%.   The break-up of the compensation  awarded by the Tribunal is as below :
</p><p id="p_3">Heads of compensation
Amount Awarded (Rs.)
Loss of support
4,95,768
Loss of love and affection
10,000
Total :
</p><p id="p_4">5,05,768

2.1 The learned counsel for the appellants/claimants would submit that the deceased was working as a Headmaster in Adi Dravidar Welfare Elementary School and was earning Rs.6,887/- per month.   Of the deductions, no amount is per se deductable for reckoning his total income and hence it must be taken as such.  This would mean the total salary should be reckoned at Rs.6,887/- and as per Sarla Verma dictim, the deceased would be entitled to an addtional 1/3rd towards his future prospects of rise in his income.  From this, 1/5th must be deducted as he was supporting a family of more than six including himself, and the appropriate multiplier applicable is 13.  However, the Tribunal has erred in fixing the monthly income at Rs.3,767/- and granted only Rs.1,000/- towards future prospects, deducted 1/3rd towards personal expenses and multiplied the product by 10, on the ground that he would superannuate in ten years. He also added that even on non-pecuniary heads of damages, the Tribunal's approach has been unreasonable.
</p>
<p id="p_5">2.2 The leanred counsel for the appellants also added that the first appellant is the legally wedded wife of the deceased and the fifth respondent before the Tribunal is his second wife and the Tribunal has shown greater charity to the second wife and granted her Rs.1,00,000/- by apportioning the compensation awarded to the legally wedded wife.
</p>
<p id="p_6">3. Per contra, the learned counsel for the insurance Company/second respondent advanced his arguments supporting the award passed by  Tribunal.
</p>
<p id="p_7">4. The learned counsel for the fifth respondent-Shantha argued that even in her counter to the claim petition, she had alleged that she was legally wedded wife of the deceased and in her evidence she has stated that  the  respondents 6 and 7 who are the parents of her husband Jayabalan are living with her, and that the first claimant/first appellant is her husband's paramour, and hence she must be given greater compensation than the first appellant.
</p>
<p id="p_8">5. This Court finds merit in the submissions of the learned counsel for the appellants.  A persual of Ext.P-7, Salary Certificate would indicate that the deceased was earning Rs.6,887/-.  This can be rounded to Rs.6,900/-. And, there is no lead that can be deducted from this.  Jayapalan was supporting a large family of more than five members, and this included two women who contest for their respecive marital status in law, as Jayabalan's wife. Therefore, only 1/5th can be deducted towards his personal expeses as per Sarla Verma dictim.  Applying a multiplier of 13, the total compensation payable on this head is [(6,900-1/5 (5,520) x 12 x 13] Rs.8,61,120/-.  On the other heads of compensation, amount awarded by the Tribunal is retained.  The total compensation is thus enhanced from Rs.5,05,768/- to Rs.8,71,120/-.
</p>
<p id="p_9">6. So far as the apportionment of compensation is concerned the compensation payable to all except the first appellant and the 5th respondent be given in the same ratio which the Tribunal has given.  So far as the compensation payable to the first appellant and the 5th respondent are concerned, in strict legal sense they have to move the civil court to seek declaration of their status as this Court cannot go into this question in this case.  Having stated thus, it is a fact that Jayabalan has begotten children through the first appellant and even 5th respondent states that they live cordially, and that she has even brought up two of the children born to the first appellant through Jayabalan. This Court, therefore considers that that factor which helped them live in harmony should not be allowed to be spoiled in sharing the money.  Hence whatever balance that is left after payment of compensation to others shall be divided equally between the first appellant and the 5th respondent.
</p>
<p id="p_10">7. In the result, the appeal is allowed and the second respondent is directed to deposit the revised award amount  Rs.8,71,120/-, less any amount already deposited, within six weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of this order, whereupon the appellants 3,4,6 and the respondents 6 and 7  are permitted withdraw their respective shares in the ratio at it was done by the Tribunal, whereas payment of compensation to the first appellant and the fifth respondent shall be paid equally as discussed in above paragraph. The proportionate share of the minor claimant shall be deposited in any one of the Nationalised Banks under reinvestment scheme initially for a period of three years, renewable thereafter periodically and the interest accrued thereon shall be withdrawn by her natural guardian, once in three months, till the minor attains majority.   The appellants are permitted to pay the additional court fee, if any.  No costs.  Consequently, connected miscellaneous petition is closed.
