JUDGEMENT
</pre>
 
<p id="p_1">1          The   complainant   company   filed   the   present   complaint   u/s   135 

r/w/sec. 151 of the <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_2">Electricity Act</a>, 2003 (hereinafter referred to as the 'Act'). 

According   to   the   complainant,   the   accused   committed   an   offence 

punishable u/sec. 135 (1) of the Act and also to determine the civil liability 

as provided under the provisions of <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_3">section 154</a> (5) of the Act.



2          Cognizance   for   offence   was   taken   on   a   complaint   filed   by   the 

complainant   company   BSES   Rajdhani   Power   Ltd.   through   its   authorised 

officer.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                             2</span><p id="p_2">

3       The accused was summoned to face the complaint case u/sec. 135 of 

the Act by Ld. Predecessor Court vide order dt. 06.02.2007 after recording 

the pre­summoning evidence and hearing the arguments on summoning. 

Accused appeared and was granted bail on furnis hing PB &amp; SB in the sum 

of Rs.20,000/­ with one surety of the like amount. Separate notice u/sec. 251 

<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_4">Cr.P.C</a>   was   framed   against   the   accused   by   the   Ld.   Predecessor   Court   to 

which the accused pleaded not guilty and claimed trial.  



4       The complainant company examined Binay Kumar - Legal Officer &amp; 

AR as PW1, Sachin Gupta  - Assistant Manager Enforcement as PW2 and 

Dheeraj Mehta - Assistant Manager Enforcement as PW3.   The statement of 

the  accused was  recorded u/sec.  313 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_5">Cr.P.C</a>. to explain the incriminating 

evidence against him.   The accused wanted to lead evidence in defence, 

therefore,   the   accused   was   given   an   opportunity   to   lead   evidence   in 

defence. The   accused in his defence examined Sh. Mani Bhushan Saroj - 

Manager as DW1 of the complainant company. Thereafter, the counsel for 

the   accused   filed   an   application   to   examine   the   accused   as   a   defence 

witness which was allowed by the court. The accused examined himself as 

DW2.

Sh.H.Rehman and prosecution represented by Sh.Rishab Raj Jain, counsel/ 

deemed P.P and have perused the entire records.

<p id="p_4">

6       Before considering the facts and   circumstances of this complaint 

case, it has to be seen and considered whether this court, being the special

court under the Act, can take cognizance of the offence punishable u/sec. 

135 of the Act.  <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_6">Section 151</a> of the Act reads as under:
</p>
<p id="p_5">

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">       ''Cognizance of offences  - No court shall take cognizance of an offence 
       punishable under  this Act except upon a complaint in writing made by 
       Appropriate   Government   or   Appropriate   Commission   or   any   of   their 
       officer authorised by them or a Chief Electrical Inspector or an Electrical 
       Inspector or licensee or the generating company, as the case may be, for 
       this purpose: 
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_2">       Provided that the court may also take cognizance of an offence punishable 
       under this Act upon a report of a police officer filed under <a href="/doc/1412034/" id="a_7">section 173</a> of 
       the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973: 
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_3">       Provided further that a special court constituted under <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_8">section 153</a> shall be 
       competent   to  take   cognizance  of   an   offence  without  the  accused  being 

       committed to it for trial.''



       In the case of Vardhman Properties Ltd. Vs BSES Rajdhani Power Ltd. 
</blockquote>
<p id="p_6">157 (2009)DLT 636, it was held by the Hon'ble High Court that:



</p><blockquote id="blockquote_4">       ''The special electricity court can take cognizance of the offence u/sec. 135 
       of the Act without awaiting committal of the case to it by the Magistrate. </blockquote><p id="p_7">
</p><p id="p_8">       Therefore, in the instant case when by the order dt. 07.04.2006, the Ld.ASJ 
       took cognizance of the offence and summoned the petitioner for offence 
       u/sec. 135 of the Act, the Ld.ASJ was exercising the powers u/sec. 151 of the 
       Act.''


       The Hon'ble High Court of Delhi in its order dated 06.02.2009 passed 

in Crl. MC 2059/2008 &amp; Crl. MA 7669/2008 entitled Dalbir Singh Vs BSES 

Rajdhani Power Limited held that :
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">       ''<a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_9">Section 154</a> (1) mandates that every offence punishable under <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_10">sections 
       135</a> to <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_11">140</a> &amp; <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_12">section 150</a> shall be triable only by the Special Court within 
       whose jurisdiction such offence has been committed.  Considering the fact 
       that <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_13">Section 154</a> (3) the Special Courts are expected to proceed with the 
       trial   of   the   complaints   under   <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_14">sections   135</a>   to   <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_15">140</a>   &amp;   <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_16">Section   150</a>   in   a 
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                                       4</span>

       summary  way,  it  is inconceivable that  the Parliament intended  that the 
       cognizance of the offence should first be taken by the learned MM and 
       thereafter the case committed to the Special Court.   Further <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_17">Section 155</a> 
       begins with the words ''Save as otherwise provided in this Act'' when it 
       talks of the applicability of the <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_18">Cr.PC</a>.  Therefore, on a collective reading of 
       <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_19">Section 135</a>, <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_20">151</a>, <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_21">154</a> (3) and 155 it is plain that as regards the trial of the 
       complaint case under the Act, the intention of the Parliament is that it is 
       the Special Court will take cognizance of the offences and proceed to try 
       the case, to begin with, in a summary way.'


7      Further, it is to be considered whether the special electricity court is 

required to give reasons for proceeding with the trial in a summary way. 
</blockquote>
<p id="p_9"><a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_22">Section 154</a> (3) reads as under :
</p>
<p id="p_10">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_6">       ''The   Special   Court   may,   notwithstanding   anything   contained   in   sub­

<blockquote id="blockquote_7">       Provided   that   where   in   the   course   of   a   summary   trial   under   this   sub­
       section, it appears to the Special court that the nature of the case is such 
       that it is undesirable to try such case in summary way, the Special Court 
       shall recall any witness who may have been examined and proceed to re­
       hear the case in the manner provided by the provisions of the said code for 
       the trial of such offence:</blockquote><p id="p_11">


</p><p id="p_12">       Provided further  that  in  the case of any conviction   in  a  summary  trial 
       under this section, it shall be lawful for a Special Court to pass a sentence 
       of imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years.''


       In this regard, the Hon'ble High Court of Delhi in the case Dalbir 

Singh (Supra) further held that :
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_8">       ''A plain reading of the above provision reveals that the intention of the 
       Parliament   was   that   cases   concerning   theft   or   illegal   abstraction   of 
       electricity, attracting the offence under <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_30">section 135</a> to <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_31">140</a> and <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_32">section 150</a> 
       of the Act,  should be tried, to  start with,  in a summary  way.   Since the 
       substantive   portion   of   the   above   provision   itself   empowers   the   Special 
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                               5</span>

        Court in this regard, it is unnecessary for the Special Court to give reasons 
        for trying the case in a summary way.  The procedure under <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_33">section 154</a> (3) 
        is indeed a departure from the procedure of trial of warrant cases under 
        the <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_34">Cr.PC</a> <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_35">Section 154</a> (3) contains a non­obstante clause which indicates 
        that it is a departure from the normal procedure.  Even <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_36">Section 155</a> of the 
        Act which otherwise makes the entire <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_37">Cr.PC</a> applicable, begins with the 
        words ''save as otherwise provided in this Act.''


8       After taking cognizance of the offence on the complaint, the accused 

namely,   Dinesh   Palhania   was   summoned   to   face   the   present   complaint 

case.   Accused appeared and was granted bail on furnishing PB and SB in 

the sum of Rs.20,000/­ with one surety of the like amount.  The notice u/sec. 
</blockquote>
<p id="p_13">251 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_38">Cr.P.C</a>. was framed against the accused, however, the accused pleaded 

not guilty and claimed trial.  In this regard, I would refer the case of Sanghi 

Brothers (Indore) P. Ltd. Vs Sanjay Chaudhary­I (2009) SLT 144, it was held 

by   the   Hon'ble   Supreme   Court   of   India   that   ''strong   suspicion   about 

commission of offence and involvement of accused is sufficient to frame 

charge.''  The statement of the accused was recorded u/sec. 313 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_39">Cr.P.C</a>.  In 

this context, I would refer the judgment delivered in the case of Chander 

Dev Rai Vs State (NCT of Delhi) 156 (2009) DLT 229 (DB), it was held by the 

Hon'ble High Court of Delhi that ''Examination of accused u/sec. 313 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_40">Cr.P.C</a> 

is  not   a   mere  formality.    Answers   given  by  him   have   practical   utility   for 

criminal   courts.     Apart   from   affording   an   opportunity   to   the   accused   to 

examine   incriminating   circumstances   against   him   also  help   the   court   in 

appreciating the entire evidence adduced in the court during the trial.''  



9       Admittedly, the accused Dinesh Palhania is now facing trial and the 

complainant   seeks   to   prove   the   complaint   case   through   circumstances 

appearing against her.   A criminal charge could be proved on the basis of 
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                                        6</span>

circumstantial   evidence   and   the   requirement   is   that   circumstances 

incriminating   in   nature   must   be   proved   by   cogent   evidence   and   then 

circumstances  so   proved   must   form   the   complete   chain  so  as   to  be   not 

consistent with the innocence of accused.   In this context, a reliance can be 

had upon the judgment passed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in 

the case reported as AIR 1970 SC 1286 held that:
</p>
<p id="p_14">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_9">        '' There is no pre­determined way of proving any fact.  The fact is said to 
        have been proved where after considering the matter before it the court 
        either   believes   it   to   exist   or   considers   its   existence   so   probable   that   a 
        prudent man ought, under the circumstances of the particular case, to act 
        upon the specification that it exists.''


        In the case of Kundan Lal Rallaram Vs Custodian Evacuee Property, 
Bombay AIR 1961 Supreme Court 1316, it was held that :
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_10">        ''...The evidence required to shift the burden need not necessarily be direct 
        evidence   i.e.   oral   or   documentary   evidence   or   admissions   made   by 
        opposite party; it may comprise circumstantial evidence or presumptions 

        of law or fact....'' 



        In the case of M/s Sodhi Transport Co. and another Vs. State of U.P. 

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_11">and another reported as AIR 1986 Supreme Court 1099, it was held by the 

Hon'ble Supreme Court of India that :

<blockquote id="blockquote_12">        ''A presumption is not in itself evidence but only makes a prima facie case 
        for party in whose favour it exists.'' 


10      Let us firstly examine whether the present complaint case has been 

filed   by   duly   authorized   representative   on   behalf   of   the   complainant 

company.   Sh.   Binay   Kumar,   Legal   Officer   being   an   authorized 

representative (hereinafter referred to as 'AR') of the complainant company 
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                              7</span>

filed the present complaint case.   The AR examined himself as PW1 and 

tendered his evidence by way of affidavit  exhibited as Ex.PX. PW1 in his 

affidavit   deposed   that   he   is   working   with   the   complainant   company   as 

Officer Legal. He has been authorised by the complainant company to sign, 

file and proceed with the criminal complaint u/sec. 135 of the <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_41">Electricity 

Act</a>, 2003 vide letter of authority/ document dated 23.10.2006, the copy of 

which exhibited as Ex.CW1/1.  PW1 has signed the complaint at point A, the 

contents of which are true as per the records of the complainant company. 
</blockquote>
<p id="p_15">The   complaint   exhibited   as   Ex.CW1/2.   During   cross   examination,   PW1 

deposed that he is working in the company since November 2004. He is 

working  as Legal Officer since 9th  October,  2006. His authority letter was 

issued on 23.10.2006. PW1 further deposed  that nobody told the facts of the 

case   to   him   but   the   complaint   has   been   prepared   on   the   basis   of   the 

documents coupled with the general discussions. He does not remember as 

to   when   the   documents   of   the   case   came   to   him   first.   PW1   denied   the 

suggestion that no documents were received by him and he has  signed the 

complaint without the documents. PW1 further denied the suggestion that 

he   does   not   know   anything   about   the   case.   Perusal   of   Ex.CW1/1   dated 

23.10.2006   reveals   that   Sh.Lalit   Jalan,   Manager   u/sec.   2   (24)   of   the 

<a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_42">Companies Act</a>, 1956 and Chief Executive Officer of BSES Rajdhani Power 

Ltd.  authorised Binay Kumar, legal officer  to institute and/or defend legal 

proceedings of whatsoever nature before the Special Courts and to sign &amp; 

verify plaints, affidavits, written statements, petitions of claims, objections, 

memorandum of appeal &amp; petition and application of all kinds and to file 

them   in   any   such   courts   or   office   apart   from   other   authorisation   as 

mentioned in the said document Ex.CW1/1.  The complainant is rendering 
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                              8</span>

services for distribution of electricity to the public and all the complaint 

cases   by   the   company   are   being   filed   through   the   authorised 

representatives   on   its   behalf.     PW1   not   only   proved   the   authority   letter 

Ex.CW1/1   in   his   favour   but   also   the   complaint   filed   by   him   Ex.CW1/2. 

Whereas, the accused has not led any evidence and failed to prove that the 

AR has not been authorised by the complainant company to file the present 

complaint case.   Thus, I hold that Sh.Binay Kumar, AR of the complainant 

company is duly authorised and competent person to file and represent the 

present complaint case on behalf of the complainant company.  



11      Now, let us secondly examine whether members of the inspection 

team were the authorised officers of the complainant company to carry out 

inspection   at   the   premises   in   question.   Sh.   Dheeraj   Mehta   -   Assistant 

Manager deposed in his examination in chief that on 23.11.2006, at around 

11:00   AM,  he   alongwith   Sh.   Sachin  Gupta   -   Assistant   Manager,   Sh.  Alok 

Kumar - GET, Gaurav Duggal - Trainee Engineer and Sumer - photographer 

from M/s. Arora Photo Studio visited the premises bearing No.­ A­26, First 

Floor, Left Side, Jungpura Extension, New Delhi. Copy of the notification 

No.F­11(93)/2003/   power/1566   dt.   17.05.2005   filed   by   the   complainant 

reveals that in exercise of the powers conferred by sub­section (2) of <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_43">section 

135</a> of the Electricity Act, 2003 (36 of 2003) read with Govt. of India, Ministry 

of Home Affairs, Notification No. F.No.U­11030/2/2003/UTL dt. 20.02.2004, 

the Lt. Governor of National Capital Territory of Delhi has authorised the 

technical   officers,   not   below   the   rank   of   Assistant   Engineer/Assistant 

Manager and above, in the departments dealing with distribution (District/ 

Zones)   commercial   and   enforcement   functions   in   BSES  Yamuna   Power 
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                             9</span>

Limited, BSES Rajdhani Power Limited and North Delhi Power Limited who 

shall be designated 'Authorised Officers' for the purpose of clause (a) of sub 

section (2) of Section (2) of <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_44">section 135</a> of the said Act in respective areas of 

the said companies in the National Capital Territory of Delhi.  In view of the 

above notification and foregoing discussions, I hold that Dheeraj Mehta - 

Assistant   Manager   and   Sh.   Sachin   Gupta   -   Assistant   Manager   were   the 

'Authorised  Officers'   to  carry   out  the  inspection   of  premises   in  question 

under the provisions of <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_45">section 135</a> of the Act. 
</p>
<p id="p_16">

12      The issue involved in the present criminal complaint case is on the 

point of detection of theft of electricity which is the crucial aspect. Let us 

finally examine whether the accused Dinesh Palhania has committed the 

offence u/sec. 135 of the Act.  It is well settled principle that prosecution has 

to   prove   its   case   against   the   accused   beyond   reasonable   doubt.   The 

complainant through its witnesses PW1 to PW3 has tried to prove the case 

against   the   accused   that   the   accused   was   committing   direct   theft   of 

electricity   at   the   premises   in   question.   PW4   was   partly   examined.    The 

complainant   was   given   ample   opportunities   to   produce   PW4   for   his 

remaining   examination  in  chief  and   cross   examination   but   PW4  did  not 

appear.  In this context, a reliance can be had upon the judgment reported 

in Kuldip Kumar &amp; Ors. Vs. State of H.P.(DB) 1993 (1) HC 454, it was held 

that   testimony   of   a   witness   includes   examination­in­chief   and   cross­

examination   u/sec.   137   and   138   of   <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_46">Indian   Evidence   Act</a>.   Statement   of   a 

witness who is not tendered for cross­examination by the opposite party is 

no evidence in the eye of law. Principles of natural Justice and fair for just &amp; 

trial it also requires that a witness must be tendered for cross­examination 
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                                 10</span>

of the opposite party failing which his statement cannot be relied upon. It 

was further held that if a witness is not tendered for cross­examination by 

the opposite party, the evidence given by him is no evidence in the eye of 

law. Further, in the  case  reported  in Anand Gupta &amp; Ors. Vs Shri J.S.Grover, 

Inspector customs 2006 VII AD (DELHI) 529, it was held by the Hon'ble High 

Court   of   Delhi   that   the   testmony   of   PW3   was   incomplete.   In   such 

circumstances, in view of the Ripen Kumar Vs Department of customs 2001 

CLJ 1288, it cannot be recorded as evidence, the testimony of PW3 cannot 

be regarded as evidence at all and there is no question of testimony being 

taken as proof of anything.   This is so because neither his examination in 

chief   was   complete   nor   was   he   subjected   to   any   cross   examination.   No 

credibility attached to this statment which had been recorded till 14.10.1999 

and the same has to be discarded in toto. In the present complaint case,  the 

testimony of PW4 is also not complete, therefore, the examination in chief 

of PW4 cannot be read in evidence and the same is discarded.



13       It is an admitted case of the accused that he was the owner and user 

and   even   he   was   present   at   site   on   the   date   of   inspection.   It   is   further 

admitted by the accused that the electricity meter was not installed at the 

premises in question on the date of inspection but it was already removed 

by   the   complainant's   officials   upon   his   request   and   the   electricity   was 

restored   by   the   officers   of   the   complainant   directly   at   the   premises   in 

question.  The   accused   was   assured   that   the   new   meter   will   be   installed 

within three­four days after removal of the meter installed at the premises 

but the meter was not installed till the date of inspection. The regular bills 

were being paid by the accused against the bills raised by the complainant. 
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                           11</span>

The   meter   burnt   by   its   own   and   the   complaint   was   lodged   with   the 

complainant.   The   officials   visited   the   premises   in   question   before   the 

inspection   was   carried   out   and   removed   the   burnt   meter   informing   the 

accused  that certain amount  has  to be deposited  against the new meter 

which   the  accused   deposited  with   the   complainant   on  01.09.2006.  DW1, 

Mani   Bhushan   Saroj   ­   Manager   brought   the   summons   record   i.e.   the 

documents Ex.PW2/D3 and the  details  of  payment Ex.PW2/D5. Payment 

details   also   proved   by   DW1   as   Ex.DW1/1.   DW1   does   not   have   any 

knowledge about the complaint Ex.PW2/D1, Ex.PW2/D2 and Ex.PW2/D4 to 

Ex.PW2/D7. DW1 deposed in his examination in chief that in case of burnt 

meter, they installed the new meter within two working days from the date 

of depositing of the charges for the same. DW1 has not personally visited 

the   premises   of   the   accused   for   inspection   of   burnt   meter.   Despite 

opportunity given, the counsel for the complainant did not cross­examine 

DW1.   DW2   also   proved   the   documents   Ex.PW2/D1,   Ex.PW2/D2   and 

Ex.PW2/D7. 
</p>
<p id="p_17">

14      Perusal of Ex.PW2/D1 reveals that it is the notice u/sec. 163 of the 

<a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_47">Electricity Act</a>, 2003 issued by the officer of the complainant. Ex.PW2/D2 is 

an application written by the accused to the BSES Manager for repair of the 

electrical meter bearing No.­ 22422427 which was received on 21.07.2006. 

Ex.PW2/D3 is the status of consumer complaint which mentions about the 

complaint   dated   21.07.2006.   Ex.PW2/D4   is   again   the   complaint   dated 

17.08.2006 written by the accused to the BM (P), D­34 Nijamuddin, BSES 

wherein   the   accused   referred   about   the   previous   complaint       dated 

21.07.2006   and   requested   to   check   the   status   and   repair   the   meter. 
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                                              12</span>

Ex.PW2/D5 is the demand note (meter burnt) which is also pertaining to 

the application dated 21.07.2006. Ex.PW2/D6 is the confirmation regarding 

checking of meter written by the accused to the Manager BSES Rajdhani 

Power Ltd., Nehru Place, New Delhi which was received on 22.11.2006 vide 

diary No.­ 431 in the office of the complainant at Nehru Place, New Delhi. 

Ex. PW2/D7 is the application for clarification regarding complaint against 

the accused for theft of electricity written by the accused to the Manager 

BSES   of   the   complainant   which   was   received   in   the   office   of   the 

complainant   on   27.11.2006.   There   are   the   remarks   of   the   officer   of   the 

complainant addressed to BM (D) that "Please confirm through the system 

the Non­replacement of the burnt meter and who had removed the burnt 

meter from the site." The BM(D) reported on the   said   application of the 

accused     that   "   as   per   my   report,   there   is   no   meter   at   site   during 

replacement   and   consumer   also   not   submitted   FIR   copy   in   the   office." 

Ex.PW2/D8 is the electricity bill for the billing month of September­2006 in 

the name of Sh. Sandeep Khurana for the address Sh. M.K.Khurana, A­26, 

F/F,   Jungpura   Extension,   New   Delhi­14   pertaining   to   the   meter   No.­ 

22422427   which   also   shows   the   past   consumption   i.e.   from 

September­2005,   November­2005,   January­2006,   March­2007,   May­2006 

and July­2006 as the "Actual". During cross­examination, PW2 deposed that 

in the bill Ex.PW2/D8, on 21.09.2006, the meter reader could not record the 

reading with regard to the consumption of power and the last reading was 

of 20.07.2006 which was 11776 units.  
</p>
<p id="p_18">

15      In  the  inspection  report,  the   supply   address  is  also  mentioned  as 

A­26, F/F, left portion, Jungpura Extension, New Delhi.   According to the 
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                                             13</span>

accused,   he     had   deposited   an   amount   of   Rs.   1,205/­   on   01.09.2006   for 

replacing   the   meter   but   the   complainant   did   not   replace   the   same. 

Ex.DW1/1 is the details of payment/ application status which also reveals 

the application dated 21.07.2006  regarding the premises in question.  PW3 

in his cross­examination admitted that the flat was at first floor and the bus 

bar   was  at   ground   floor   and   the   approximate   distance   between   the   two 

12­15 feets approximately. PW3 also admitted that there is no endorsement 

of refusal of acceptance of documents on records. PW3 further admitted 

that   the   photographs   Ex.CW2/5   depicts   only   one   window   A.C.   and   one 

television. Perusal of the photographs Ex.CW2/5 reveals that no location of 

the premises in question focused from outside. Even otherwise,  there is no 

photographs of the accused focused in the photographs Ex.CW2/5. I have 

also seen the CD Ex.CW2/6. No reason or explanation in response to the 

aforesaid complaints and letters of the accused given by the complainant. It 

was incumbent upon the complainant to install the new meter within three 

days from the date of removal of the meter  which the complainant failed to 

do so. Ex.PW2/D8 clearly  reveals the actual consumption of electricity used 

by the accused at the premises in question till Jul­2006. The complaint by 

the accused was made on 21.07.2006 to repair the meter. The demand note 

was issued on 01.09.2006 for the meter burnt.  The last letter of the accused 

before the inspection was filed with the complainant's office on 22.11.2006. 

The inspection of the premises in question was carried out on 23.11.2006. 

Therefore, I find that there is no reason not to accept the circumstances and 

the   aforesaid   evidence   proved   by   the   accused   through   its   witnesses 

examined   as   DW1   &amp;   DW2   against   direct   theft   of   electricity.   Thus,  the 

complainant has not proved on record that the accused was committing 
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                                              14</span>

direct theft of electricity at the premises bearing No. A­26, F/F left Portion, 

Jangpura   Extension,   New   Delhi.  This   is   not   a   case   of   direct   theft   of 

electricity but the case of assessment of the electricity consumed by the 

accused from the date of burnt meter till the date of inspection. 



16      For   the   foregoing   reasons   discussed   above   in   details,   to   my 

considered   opinion,   the   complainant   company   has   not   established   the 

involvement of the accused in the offence of direct theft of electricity.  The 

complainant has not proved its case against the accused beyond reasonable 

doubt.  The present complaint case is  not covered within the provisions of 

<a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_48">section  135</a> of  the Act.   Thus, I acquit the  accused    Sh. Dinesh  Palhania 

u/sec. 135 of the Act. However, the complainant shall assess the period from 

the date of burnt meter till the date of inspection and calculate the amount 

against the electricity consumed by the accused which shall be payable by 

the accused to the complainant within one month from today.
