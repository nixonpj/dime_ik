</p>
<p id="p_9">                 3. In view thereof, the name of petitioner no. 1 is

</p><p id="p_10">                     4. The petitioner has moved the Court under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_1">Section

        482</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (hereinafter referred

        to as the 'Code') for the following relief:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">                               "That this is an application for
                     quashing the entire prosecution including Order
                     dated 27.12.2010, passed by Learned A.K. Gond,
                     J.M. Ist Class, Kosera, Samastipur in Complaint
                     Case No. 396 of 2007 by which the petitioners
                     have been summoned as additional accused."</blockquote><p id="p_11">

</p><p id="p_12">                     5. The allegation against the petitioner and five others

        was of demand of dowry, torture and assault and also taking away

        of the jewellery of the opposite party no. 2-complainant.

</p><p id="p_13">                     6. Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that he is

        the brother of the husband of the opposite party no. 2 and had no

        role in the matrimonial discord between the husband and the wife.

        It was submitted that the allegations have been made only to

        harass the petitioner and also to exert undue pressure on his

        brother and other family members to act as per the dictates of the

        opposite party no. 2. Learned counsel submitted that after filing of

        the complaint, a compromise has also been arrived at between the

        parties and such petition has been filed before the Court below on

        18.08.2011. It was submitted that in view of the matter being

        related to matrimonial dispute, once the opposite party no. 2 has

        entered into a compromise, the criminal proceeding is required to

        be terminated. Learned counsel submitted that even when the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                            3/6</span>




        matter was sent for Mediation, despite notice, the opposite party

        no. 2 did not appear before the Mediator and, thus, the same

        failed.
</p>
<p id="p_14">                     7. Learned APP fairly submitted that in view of the

        compromise filed before the Court below, the present case

        deserves to be interfered with.
</p>
<p id="p_15">                     8. Learned counsel for the opposite party no. 2 was not

        in a position to controvert the filing of a joint compromise before

        the Court below. Further, she was also not in a position to explain

        why the opposite party no. 2 did not appear before the learned

        Mediator.
</p>
<p id="p_16">                     9. Having considered the facts and circumstances of the

        case and submissions of learned counsel for the parties, the Court

        finds that a case for interference has been made out.

</p><p id="p_17">                     10. The Court has been persuaded basically in the

        background that there has been a compromise between the parties

        and the opposite party no. 2 has signed the petition stating that she

        wants the case to be closed. Further, her conduct of not appearing

        despite notice, before the learned Mediator and learned counsel

        representing her before the Court not being in a position to

        controvert the compromise or explain such non appearance,

        indicates that she has no grounds to oppose the application.

        of which reads as under:

                     of Punjab</a>, a two-Judge Bench placed reliance on

                     Chandigarh</a> and distinguished the decision in <a href="/doc/193433171/" id="a_6">State

                     that in the facts of the said case the proceedings
                     under Section 307 deserved to be quashed. The two-
                     Judge Bench laid down certain guidelines by which
                     the High Courts would be guided in giving
                     adequate treatment to the settlement between the
                     parties and exercising its power under Section 482
                     of the Code while accepting the settlement and
                     quashing the proceedings or refusing to accept the
                     settlement. Some of the guidelines which are
                     relevant for the present purpose are reproduced
                     below: (Narinder Singh case SCC p. 483, para 29)
                                "29.2. (II) When the parties have reached
                     the settlement and on that basis petition for
                     quashing the criminal proceedings is filed, the
                     guiding factor in such cases would be to secure:

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">                     While exercising the power the High Court is to
                     form an opinion on either of the aforesaid two
                     objectives.</blockquote><p id="p_19">
</p><p id="p_20">                                29.3. (III) Such a power is not to be

                     heinous and serious offences of mental depravity or
                     offences like murder, rape, dacoity, etc. Such
                     offences are not private in nature and have a
                     serious impact on society. Similarly, for offences
                     alleged to have been committed under special
                     statute like the <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_7">Prevention of Corruption Act</a> or the

                     offences committed by public servants while
                     working in that capacity are not to be quashed
                     merely on the basis of compromise between the

</p><p id="p_21">                                29.4. (IV) On the other hand, those
                     criminal cases having overwhelmingly and
                     predominantly civil character, particularly those
                     arising out of commercial transactions or arising
                     out of matrimonial relationship or family disputes
                     should be quashed when the parties have resolved
                     their entire disputes among themselves.
</p><p id="p_22">                                29.5. (V) While exercising its powers, the
                     High Court is to examine as to whether the
                     possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and
                     continuation of criminal cases would put the
                     accused to great oppression and prejudice and
                     extreme injustice would be caused to him by not
                     quashing the criminal cases."

<p id="p_23">                     12. In the present case, in the considered opinion of the

        Court, taking note of the aforesaid judgment in Vikram Anantrai

        Doshi (supra), the matter basically relating to matrimonial dispute

        and the parties having settled the matter, letting the criminal case

        to continue would be an abuse of the process of the Court.

</p><p id="p_24">                     13. Accordingly, the application is allowed. The entire

        the order dated 27.12.2010 by which cognizance has been taken,
