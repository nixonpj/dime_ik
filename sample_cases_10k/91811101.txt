</pre><p id="p_1">	Aggrieved by the concurrent findings of the Court below, the plaintiff has preferred the above appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_2">	2. The suit is filed by the plaintiff for declaration that he has got title to the suit property and for consequential permanent injunction restraining the defendants 1 and 2 from disturbing the peaceful possession.
</p>
<p id="p_3">	3. The case of the plaintiff is that the suit property was originally owned by the first defendant Muthusamy Padayachi in S.No.32/2 with an extent of 0.92 cents with a well. The father of the plaintiff one Muthusamy Padayachi and the first defendant entered into a sale agreement on 20.12.1976 agreeing to convey the said property for a sum of Rs.6,500 and initially a sum of Rs.500/- was paid to the first defendant as advance by the father of the plaintiff. The sale was to be executed on or before Tamil Month of Masi in the year 1977. 
</p>
<p id="p_4">	4. The first defendant by receiving the balance of sale price of Rs.6,000 from the plaintiff's father, handed over the possession of the suit property agreeing to execute the sale deed later. Accordingly, the plaintiff's father is in possession and enjoyment of the suit property by raising seasonal crops. After the death of the plaintiff's father and his wife, the plaintiff has been in possession of the suit property. It is further stated in the plaint that the bodies of the plaintiff's father and his wife were buried in the suit property itself, where on, the plaintiff has also constructed tombs for his parents. The plaintiff is said to be running a Lathe Workshop and also dug up a bore well in the suit property. The second defendant who has purchased the property from the first defendant tried to disposess the plaintiff based on the strength of the sale deed. Hence, the suit has been filed by the plaintiff. 
</p>
<p id="p_5">	5. The first defendant did not file any written statement and the second defendant resisted the suit by filing the written statement contending that the suit property belongs to the first defendant as per sale deed dated 20.04.1967 and he has been in enjoyment of the same by doing cultivation. The suit property was purchased by the second defendant on 24.12.2008 and from the date of purchase the second defendant has been in possession of the property. The plaintiff demanded the first defendant to part with the suit property and when the same was refused the plaintiff started troubling the defendant.  The second defendant also denied the execution of the sale agreement between the plaintiff's father and the first defendant made on 20.12.1976 and also the terms of the agreement as false. According to him, the said agreement is fabricated for the purpose of the suit. The alleged Lathe Workshop and the bore well are only in the land bearing in S.No.32/3 whereas the suit property is in S.No.32/2. Hence, the Plaintiff' cannot claim title by adverse possession also. It is further contended by the second defendant that without setting aside the sale deed dated 24.12.2008 the suit framed as such is not maintainable.
</p> 
<p id="p_6">	6. Before the Trial Court, on the side of the Plaintiff, the Plaintiff himself was examined P.W.1 and Exs.P1 to P11 have been marked and one Elango has been examined as P.W.2. On the side of the defendants, the first defendant himself was examined as D.W.1 and Exs.B1 to B22 have been marked and the second defendant examined himself as D.W.2. One Mohan has been examined as D.W.3 and one Karunanidhi has been examined as D.W.4. After considering the facts and evidence available, the trial Court had dismissed the suit. On appeal by the Plaintiff, the Lower Appellate Court also confirmed the same.  Aggrieved by the said concurrent findings of the Court below, the above Second Appeal is filed.
</p>
<p id="p_7">	7. The Courts below based on the above documents and evidence, concurrently held that the plaintiff is not entitled for the relief as prayed for. Aggrieved by the same, the above second appeal is filed. At the time of admission the following question of law was  framed:
</p>	
<p id="p_8">	"When the plaintiff's possession of the suit property is due to part performance of an agreement of sale, whether his possession should not be protected under <a href="/doc/221518/" id="a_1">Section 53A</a> of the Transfer of Property Act."
</p>
	
<p id="p_9">	8. The plaintiff/appellant filed the suit for declaration of title and for the second relief of permanent injunction claiming title by adverse possession against the defendants. 
</p>
<p id="p_10">	9. The learned senior counsel appearing for the plaintiff/ appellant contended that the relief of declaration is not pressed, and argued only for the relief of permanent injunction. 
</p>
<p id="p_11">	10. Admittedly, the first defendant is the owner and the property was sold to the second defendant on 24.12.2008 as per Ex.B2. The case of the plaintiff is that his father Muthusamy Padayachi entered into an unregistered sale agreement with the first defendant as per Ex.P2 on 20.12.1976. According to him, he has been put in possession from the date of agreement itself and has been in continuous enjoyment of the same.
</p>
<p id="p_12">	11. It is further stated that the tombs of the plaintiff's parents are also situated in the suit property. The plaintiff also produced Adangal extract of the property as per Ex.P6 to prove his possession. The plaintiff/appellant also relied on the report and plan of the commissioner which is marked as Ex.C1 and C2 to collaborate the factum of possession. As stated earlier, the first defendant did not file any written statement. The second defendant who is the subsequent purchaser has filed an objection to the report and plan of the commissioner and alleged that the commissioner never visited the suit property and failed to distinguish the Survey fields bearing S.Nos.32/2, 32/3, 32/1. As the appellant had given up the relief of declaration of title based on possession, the said question has not been gone into. The only question that has to be decided in the appeal is whether the possession of the plaintiff is protected under <a href="/doc/221518/" id="a_2">Section 53A</a> of the Transfer of Property Act?
</p>
<p id="p_13">	12. It is the consistent case of the plaintiff that he was put in possession of the suit property on the date of sale agreement dated 20.12.1976. Hence, it is pleaded that his possession has to be protected under <a href="/doc/221518/" id="a_3">Section 53A</a> of the Transfer of Property Act as he is in possession of the property in part performance of the contract.
</p>
<p id="p_14">	13. It is further argued that even if the limitation to file the suit for specific performance had expired, his possession has to be protected. In such view of the argument, it will be useful to see the necessary conditions to be complied with for a person to claim protection under <a href="/doc/221518/" id="a_4">Section 53A</a> of the Transfer of Property Act. The necessary conditions are as follows:
</p>		
<p id="p_15">(i) There must be a contract to transfer for consideration of any movable property. 
</p>
<p id="p_16">(ii) The contract must be in writing signed by the transferor or by some one on his behalf. 
</p>
<p id="p_17">(iii) The writing must be in such words from which the terms necessary to consider the transfer can be ascertained. 
</p>
<p id="p_18">(iv) The transferee must in part performance of the contract to take possession of the property or of any part thereof. 
</p>
<p id="p_19">(v) The transferee must have done some Act in furtherance of the contract, and 

</p><p id="p_20">(vi) The transferee must have to perform or be willing to perform his part of the contract.
</p>
<p id="p_21">	14. From the above conditions, the rights conferred on the transferee are clear in respect of the property against the transferor or any person claiming under him. Provision under <a href="/doc/221518/" id="a_5">Section 53A</a> of the Transfer of Property Act is to provide a shield of protection to the proposed transferee to remain in possession against the original owner who had agreed to sell the property to the transferee. However, such protection is subject to the transferee satisfying the conditions mentioned above.
</p>
<p id="p_22">	15. Though the right conferred under <a href="/doc/221518/" id="a_6">Section 53A</a> is a shield against the transferor, the same has got nothing to do with the ownership of the proposed transferor who continues to remain as the owner of the land till he legally conveyed by sale deed to the proposed transferee. Thus, on the basis of possession under <a href="/doc/221518/" id="a_7">Section 53A</a>, a transferee cannot claim title and seek for declaration. In the present case, though the claim of declaration of title is given up, yet the plaintiff is battling for permanent injunction to retain his possession. 
</p>
<p id="p_23">	16. Be that as it may, the learned counsel appearing for the respondents contended that the second defendant had purchased the property on 24.12.2008 as per Ex.B2 whereas the suit was filed on 05.02.2009 which is much after the sale by the first defendant in favour of the second defendant. The learned counsel for the respondents also pointed out that as per sale agreement dated 20.12.1976 only when the balance of sale consideration of Rs.6,000 was paid to the transferor, possession will be given to the transferee. The relevant portion of Ex.A2 is as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_24">	",dp ,d;W es tUlk; khrp khjk; 30k; njjpf;Fs; 1k; ,yf;fkpl;lthpd; brytpy; vGjpf;bfhs;Sk; fpiua gj;jpuk; K:yk; 1k; ,yf;fkpl;ltUf;nfh 1k; ,yf;fkpl;lth; nfhUk; egh; bgaUf;nfh 2k; ,yf;fkpl;lth; fPH;f;fz;l xg;ge;j brhj;ij rh;t tpy;y';f Rj;jpaha; Rj;jf; fpiuak; RthjPdKk; bra;Jf; bfhLj;J kPjp fpiua bjhif U:/6000-? Muhapuk; U:ghiaa[k; 2k; ,yf;fkpl;lth; buhf;fkhf bgw;Wf;bfhs;s ntz;oaJ/  nkw;fz;l tha;jht[f;Fs; kPjp fpiua bjhifia brYj;jp fpiuak; bra;Jf; bfhs;s 1k; ,yf;fkpl;lth; jtwpdhy; jtwpa njjpapnyna nkw;fz;l fpiua ml;thd;!; bjhif g{uhita[k; 1k; ,yf;fkpl;lth; ,He;JtpLtJld; ,e;j fpiua xg;ge;jKk; uj;jhf ntz;oaJ."
</p>
	
<p id="p_25">	17. From the reading of the above, it is clear that unless the plaintiff prove that the balance of Rs.6,000 was paid, the possession would not have been given to the plaintiff. Except the payment of Rs.500 as advance, there is no evidence to show that the sum of Rs.6,000 was paid to the transferor, thereby, making the full payment of the sale consideration. If at all the plaintiff had paid the balance of Rs.6,000, an endorsement would have been made either on the sale agreement or atleast an independent receipt would have been received. In the absence of both, it cannot be inferred that the plaintiff had paid the entire sale consideration, after which, the possession was given to the plaintiff. It is pointed out by the learned counsel for the respondents that except the payment of Rs.500/- (Rupees Five Hundred only) which is paid as advance, the plaintiff is unable to substantiate the claim though he has paid Rs.6000/- in the balance of sale consideration. When the agreement itself indicate that possession would be given only on payment of the entire sale consideration, in the absence of proof of payment of the balance of sale consideration the Courts below rightly held that the possession is not to be with the plaintiff.
</p>
<p id="p_26">	18. The first defendant though had not filed his written statement, has deposed as DW1. He has specifically stated that the balance of Rs.6,000 was never received from the father of the plaintiff and the possession was never given to the plaintiff's father as the payment of the balance of amount was not paid. Whereas, with respect to the same, the plaintiff as PW1 has stated as follows.
</p>	
<p id="p_27">	"20/12/1976 md;W fpiua xg;ge;jk; Vw;gl;lnghJ ehDk; cld; ,Ue;njd;/ mjdhy; me;j Mtzj;ij gw;wp vdf;F bjhpa[k;/ nkw;go tpguj;ij ehd; gpuhjpy; brhy;ytpy;iy/ 20/12/1976 md;W Vw;gl;l xg;ge;jk; gpd;dpl;Ljtwptplf;TlhJ vd;w fhuzj;jpdhy; U:ghia bfhLj;J vGj;Jg{h;tkhf vGjp th';fpf;bfhz;nlhk;/"  
</p>
	
<p id="p_28">	19. As admitted in the Cross Examination, the plaintiff himself has not substantiated the payment of Rs.6,000 paid to the first defendant who is the vendor. Admittedly, the plaintiff has also not taken any steps to perform his part of the contract to get the sale executed. As per one of the conditions, the transferee must have done some Act in furtherance of the contract. In the case on hand, the plaintiff though claimed that he had paid the entire sale consideration, had not taken any steps to get the sale executed in his favour. Even presuming that the plaintiff was in possession of the property, that does not confer any title in his favour unless and otherwise he performed his part of the contract by taking steps to get the sale executed in his favour. There is no iota of evidence to show that the plaintiff was ever willing to perform his part of the contract. Therefore, the plaintiff as a transferee claiming to be in possession can use <a href="/doc/221518/" id="a_8">Section 53A</a> as a shield but not as a sword. 
</p>
<p id="p_29">	20. <a href="/doc/221518/" id="a_9">Section 53A</a> can be used by the plaintiff to protect his possession but he cannot use <a href="/doc/221518/" id="a_10">Section 53A</a> for getting possession if he is not actually in possession. In the absence of any evidence to show that the plaintiff is in possession of the suit property, the plaintiff is not entitled to get relief as prayed for. The Appellate Court also has found that even if the possession of the plaintiff is to be accepted, the plaintiff has not pleaded as to when was he put in possession as he has not performed his part of the contract as per the agreement.
</p>
<p id="p_30">	21. In the conspectus of the above facts, the question of law is answered against the plaintiff and the appeal is dismissed, confirming the Judgment and Decree of the Courts below. No Costs. Consequently, the connected miscellaneous petition is closed.
