        which   date   he   sought   time   for   the   purpose   and   thereafter 

       failed   to   file   his   affidavit   despite   sufficient   opportunities

       findings are as under:­

ISSUE NO. 1  AND 2:
</p>
<p id="p_9">   6. The onus to prove these issues was upon the workman but he 

       failed to prove the same and did not lead any evidence in 

       support of these issues. He could not place any document or 

       prove   the   same   to   show   that   he   was   an   employ   of   the 

       management. He did not examine any other co­employee to 

       prove   this   fact   nor   summoned   any   document   from   the 

       management   to   establish   this   fact.   Hence   these   issues   are 

       decided   in   favour   of   the   management   and   against   the 

       workman.
