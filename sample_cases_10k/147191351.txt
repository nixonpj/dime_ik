BY THE COURT : (PER HON'BLE DHADDHA,J.)</pre>



<p id="p_1">              This special appeal has been filed by the appellant -

   RSRTC against the order dated 30.8.2017 passed by the learned

   Single Judge whereby the learned Single Judge had dismissed the

   writ petition and upheld the order passed by the Industrial

   Tribunal, Jaipur.

</p><p id="p_3">                                                (2 of 3)                     [SAW-165/2018]



             Brief facts of the case are that the appellant is a

corporation under the Government of Rajasthan.                               Respondent

No.1 was conductor in the appellant - RSRTC. Respondent No.1

was served a chargesheet dated 4.11.1993 for committing

misconduct while on duty in which he was found carrying ten

passengers from Pali to Jodhpur and entry was not made in the

original tickets and the fare was collected from these passengers.

After   affording     of    opportunity          of   personal         hearing      to   the

delinquent employee,            a penalty of dismissal from service was

imposed upon him vide order dated 29.12.1999. Thereafter, the

appellant     - RSRTC filed an application u/s 33(2)(b) of the

<a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_1">Industrial Disputes Act</a>, 1947 before the learned Industrial

Tribunal for approval of proposed penalty of dismissal from

service. The learned Industrial Tribunal heard the matter and while

disallowing    the    application         of    the       respondent        No.1    herein,

declared the order of penalty of dismissal from service of the

respondent No.1 to be not proper and valid. The learned

Industrial    Tribunal     dismissed           the    penalty        vide   order    dated

20.2.2017. The appellant RSRTC filed a writ petition which was

dismissed     by     the    learned       Single       Judge         vide   order    dated

30.8.2017.
</p>
<p id="p_4">             Learned counsel for the appellant submits that the

impugned order dated 30.8.2017 is perverse on the face of itself.

The learned Single Judge ignored the relevant law on the point.

Therefore, the impugned order has been vitiated on this ground.

The learned counsel submits that the learned Industrial Tribunal

had acted contrary to the evidence available on record and passed

the order on flimsy ground and ignored the evidence and

misreported the evidence adduced in support of charge by the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                         (Downloaded on 29/06/2019 at 12:58:59 AM)</span>
                                                                               (3 of 3)               [SAW-165/2018]



                                   appellant. Learned counsel for the appellant vehemently argued

                                   that the orders of the learned Single Judge as well as the

                                   Industrial Tribunal deserve to be quashed.
</p>
<p id="p_5">                                                We have given our thoughtful consideration to the

                                   submissions advanced by the learned counsel for the appellant,

                                   perused the impugned order and the material available on record.

</p><p id="p_6">                                                In our considered opinion, the order of the learned

                                   Single Judge does not suffer from any illegality or infirmity. The

                                   learned Industrial Tribunal by its elaborated and well reasoned

                                   order, rejected the application filed by the appellant RSRTC for

                                   seeking approval of punishment order dated 29.12.1999. The

                                   learned Industrial Tribunal declared the impugned order dated

                                   29.12.1999 unjustified. The Industrial Tribunal examined the

                                   veracity of the charge, reached to the conclusion that the charges

                                   having lapse of original tickets as blank, was contrary to the

                                   factual background as in the way bill and ticket books there were

                                   nine passengers noted and ten tickets had already been released

                                   by the conductor. The conductor had already entered the amount

                                   received in the way bill. The conductor had not misappropriated or

                                   embezzled the money. So, in these circumstances, we do not find

                                   any merit in this appeal and it deserves to be dismissed.

</p><p id="p_7">                                                In the result, the appeal as well as stay application is

                                   dismissed.
