<p id="p_1">S.Siri Jagan, J

           The appellants are the claimants in O.P(M.V).

No.424/1999 before the Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal,

Pathanamthitta. They are the parents of Nebu Varghese,

who died in an accident, caused by the negligent driving

of a vehicle, owned and driven by respondents 1 and 2

and insured with the 3rd respondent. The appellants filed

the O.P., claiming compensation for the death of their

son. The tribunal, after finding negligence on the part of

the driver of the vehicle awarded compensation under

various heads as follows:
</p>
<pre id="pre_2">        Sl.                      Head of claim                  Amount awarded
        No.                                                                
        1   Compensation for pain and suffering                                7500
</pre><p id="p_2">            Medical expenses, transportation,
            post-mortem, funeral &amp; allied
        2   expenses                                                           5000
        3   Loss of love and affection                                        20000
        4   Loss of estate                                                     2500
        5   Loss of dependency                                               130000
                  Total                                                      165000


Dissatisfied with the quantum of compensation awarded

by the tribunal, the appellants have filed this appeal,

M.A.C.A. No.1273 of 2007
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                              2</span>

seeking enhanced compensation.
</p>
<p id="p_3">            2.   The contention of the appellants is that the

deceased was a very bright student, despite which, the

tribunal fixed only a notional income of  15,000/- per

annum for the purpose of calculating loss of dependency.

It is also submitted that the tribunal has taken the

multiplier only as 13, whereas, going by the age of the

deceased, the multiplier should have been 18. The

appellants seek enhancement under other heads also.

</p><p id="p_4">            3.   We have considered the rival contentions

in detail.
</p>
<p id="p_5">            4.   The deceased was only 16 years old. He

was admittedly a student. Apart from his S.S.L.C

certificate and a certificate of merit issued by the High

School where he had studied, there is nothing to suggest

that he was extraordinarily brilliant to merit a higher

annual notional income. The accident was on 27.04.1998.

The parliament had fixed the notional income of a non-

earning member in the year 1995 as  15,000/- in

M.A.C.A. No.1273 of 2007
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                            3</span>

schedule 2 of the <a href="/doc/785258/" id="a_1">Motor Vehicles Act</a>. Therefore, we do

not think that the tribunal was wrong in fixing the annual

income of the deceased as  15,000/-. But in view of the

decision of the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/44705552/" id="a_2">Amrit Bhanu Shali

and others v. National Insurance Co. Ltd., and

others</a> (2012 ACJ 2002), the multiplier has to be

selected based on the age of the deceased and not on the

basis of the age of the dependents. For a 16 year old

person, going by the decision in <a href="/doc/837924/" id="a_3">Sarla Verma v. Delhi

Transport Corporation</a> 2010 (2) KLT 802 (SC), the

appropriate multiplier is 18. But, at the same time,

insofar as the deceased was a bachelor and only the

parents are the claimants, 50% has to be deducted for

personal expenses of the deceased, going by the decision

in Sarla Verma's case(supra). Calculated thus, the

appellants would be entitled to  1,35,000/- as the

compensation for loss of dependency(15,000x18/2).

Consequently, the appellants would be entilted to

additional compensation of  5,000/-, under the head loss

M.A.C.A. No.1273 of 2007
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                 4</span>

of dependency.        We are not inclined to enhance the

compensation under other heads, insofar as, we are of

opinion that, just and reasonable compensation has been

awarded under other heads. Accordingly, over and above

what has been awarded by the tribunal, the appellants

would be entitled to addional compensation of  5,000/-,

which shall carry interest at the rate of 9% per annum

from the date of the claim petition, till date of payment.

The 3rd respondent insurance company is directed to

deposit that amount also within two months.

</p><p id="p_6">            With the above modification of the impugned

award of the tribunal, the appeal is disposed of.
