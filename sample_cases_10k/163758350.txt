                     ------------------------
                    L.A.A.No. 221 OF 2011
                     ------------------------

              Dated this the 1st day of April, 2011

                           JUDGMENT
</pre>

<p id="p_1">Pius C.Kuriakose, J.
</p>
<p id="p_2">

</p><p id="p_3">      The claimant is in appeal. Her property in Thrikkadavoor

village was    acquired pursuant to Section 4(1) notification

published on 30/5/199.5 The acquisition was for the purpose of

construction of Kollam Bye pass. The land was dry land. The

Land Acquisition Officer awarded land value at the rate of

Rs.35,405/- per Are.
</p>
<p id="p_4">      2. Before the Reference Court, Ext.A1 and A2 two pre

notification documents reflecting value of Rs.75,000/- per are

were relied on.   These documents were proved by examining

PW1 claimant herself. The claimant in cross examination by the

Government Pleader was unable        to give the details of the

scheduled portions of these documents. The learned Sub Judge

for the above reason did not place any reliance on these two

documents.    Ultimately what the learned Sub Judge did was to

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">LAA.No.221/2011                 2</span>

do guess work and to refix the market value              granting

enhancement of 30% above what was awarded by the LAO.

</p><p id="p_5">     3. Sri.C.A.Rajeev, learned counsel for the appellant would

argue before us     that the court below was not justified in

discarding Exts.A1 and A2 completely.       Smt.P.N.Sumangala,

learned Government Pleader however would support the

impugned judgment. According to her, as Exts.A1 and A2 were

not properly proved by examining vendor or vendee, the court

below was not justified in not placing reliance on them. True,

Exts.A1 and A2 were not proved by examining the parties. but

we notice another aspect of the matter. To whatever evidence

that was adduced by the claimant, there is not even formal

counter evidence on the side of the Government. We are of the

view that there was justification for placing reliance at least to

a certain extent on Exts.A1 and A2. Keeping in mind Exts.A1 and

A2 also, we are inclined to refix the market value of the land

under acquisition at Rs.50,000/- per Are.

</p><p id="p_6">     4. We allow this appeal by refixing the market value of the

land at Rs.50,000/- per Are. The appellant will be entitled for all

statutory benefits admissible under Section 23(2), 23(1A) and

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">LAA.No.221/2011                  3</span>

Section 28 of the Act on the total refixed compensation to which

she becomes eligible by virtue of this judgment. However, while

providing for interest under Section 28, the Section will have due

regard to the conditions imposed by us in our orders            in

C.M.Appln. No.479/2011 and        C.M.Appln. No.399/2011.      The

Section will issue decree copy only after ensuring that the

conditions imposed by us under the above two orders have been

complied with and that full court fee payable on the appeal

memorandum is paid.

Pius C.Kuriakose, J.
</p>
<p id="p_13">

</p><p id="p_14">      This application seeks condonation of the delay of 825 days

caused in the matter of filing the appeal.      We are     not fully

convinced by the explanation offered by the appellant for the

delay. There is stiff opposition from the side of the Government

also for condoning the delay. However, on the consideration that

as far as possible causes should be allowed to be adjudicated on

merits rather than decided on technicalities, we are inclined to

condone the delay imposing terms. Hence, it is ordered that the

delay will stand condoned subject to the following conditions;

</p><p id="p_15">      i). The appellant shall pay a sum of Rs.1500/- to the High

Court Legal Services Committee within ten days from today.

</p><p id="p_16">      ii). In case the appeal is allowed and the appellant becomes

eligible for enhanced compensation, such enhanced compensation

will not carry interest otherwise admissible under Section 28 of

the Act during the period of 825 days condoned by this order.

the appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_18">     The Registry will send up the appeal for admission once

receipt against payment of the above amount is noticed.
