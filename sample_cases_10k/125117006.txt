   BEFORE:
   The Hon'ble JUSTICE ASHIS KUMAR CHAKRABORTY
   Date : 26th November, 2019.

                                                               Appearance:
                                                         Mr. Arnab Basu Mullick, Adv.

                                                         Mr. Siddhartha Chatterjee, Adv.
                                                         Mr. Abirlal Ghosh, Adv.
                                                         Ms. A. Dutta, Adv.
                                                               ... for respondents.</pre>

<p id="p_1">       The   Court     :    The    applicant        in   this    application       filed    an

application      A.P.       No.580       of    2019,     under     <a href="/doc/1120409/" id="a_1">Section     9</a>    of     the

Arbitration and <a href="/doc/1306164/" id="a_2">Conciliation Act</a>, 1996, as amended by Act 3 of

2016(in      short,    "the       Act    of    1996")    praying    for,     inter       alia,

appointment of a Receiver to take possession of two assets which

remain hypothecated in their favour by the respondents.

</p><p id="p_2">       On September 5, 2019 when the application, A.P. No. 580 of

2019 was taken up for hearing respondent company submitted that

they   have    no     objection         if    the   prayer   of    the   petitioner        was

allowed.      Accordingly, with consent of the respondent this Court

passed an order dated September 5, 2019 appointing a Receiver to

take possession of all the twelve assets which according to the

respondents were lying at Bhilwara in the state of Rajasthan.

However, from the report of the Receiver it appears that he could
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                                  2</span>

take possession of only nine assets which were lying in the Mines

of Jindal Saw Ltd. at Bhilwara. So far as the balance three assets

are concerned it appears that the respondent company are not in a

position     to       render    any   assistance          to        the    Receiver      to    take

possession of the same.               In this application, the petitioner has

made a prayer to the effect that a direction be issued against the

respondent to depute one of their officers to assist the Receiver

to take possession of the said balance three hypothecated assets.

The respondent, however, submit that due to reasons beyond their

control it may not be possible for them to depute any officer to

accompany the Receiver for taking possession of the said three

hypothecated      assets.         When     the       parties    have       not    been   able    to

render assistance to the Receiver, I find that the Receiver has no

scope to take possession of the said three assets.

</p><p id="p_3">       Accordingly, I do not find any reason to pass any order in

this    application.           The    Receiver        shall     continue          to   remain    in

possession       of    the     nine   assets         mentioned        in    his    report     till

disposal of the arbitral proceeding. The Receiver shall be paid

the    monthly    remuneration        of    600       Gms.     by    the    petitioner        until

further direction that may be passed by the Arbitrator in the

arbitral proceeding.
</p>
<p id="p_4">       With the above directions, the application, A.P. No. 580 of

2019 along with G.A. No. 2258 of 2019 stands disposed of.
