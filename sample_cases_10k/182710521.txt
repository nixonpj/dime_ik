                       JUDGEMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">      The Private Complaint is filed under <a href="/doc/444619/" id="a_2">Section 200</a> of Cr.P.C

against the accused alleging that she has committed            the

offence   punishable     under    <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_3">Section   138</a>   of   Negotiable

Instruments Act.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">      2. The brief facts of the complaint are as follows :

      The complainant submits that the Complainant is a

private company namely Nandajyothi Chits India Pvt. Ltd.

registered as per <a href="/doc/194827648/" id="a_4">Chits Funds Act</a>, 1982. The Accused is one of

the Subscribers and members of the chit group No.E1-

40/01/13, Ticket No.37, Chit value of Rs.5,00,000/- for 40

months. But the Accused          was an irregular subscriber of

monthly installments.     The Accused       was due for sum of

Rs.1,24,031/-. Therefore, the Accused has issued a Cheque

bearing No.049861, dtd.31.7.2017 for above said amount

drawn on Bharat Bank, Indiranagar branch, Bengaluru. The

Complainant presented the said Cheque through his banker

i.e., Federal Bank, Marathahalli branch. But the Cheque was
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                3                    CC.No.52750/2018</span>


returned with shara for "funds insufficient". After dishonour

of the Cheque the Complainant immediately informed to the

Accused. But the Accused      did not fulfill the demand of the

Complainant. Therefore, the demand notice was issued on

9.10.2017 and the said notice was served on 10.10.2017 to the

address of the Accused. The Accused deliberately issued the

Cheque knowing that her account was not balanced with the

amount for honouring of Cheque. Therefore, the Complainant

prays to convict and grant compensation.




</p><p id="p_4">     3.   The cognizance for offence was taken of my learned

predecessor. The criminal case came to be registered against

the accused. The summons was issued to the accused. The

accused in obedience of the summons appeared before the

Court and enlarged on bail.
</p>
<p id="p_5">

</p><p id="p_6">     4. The substance of the accusation was framed, read over

and explained to the accused in the language known to her by

the learned predecessor of this Court. The accused pleaded not

guilty and claimed to try the case. Hence, the case was posted

for complainant's evidence.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                   4                    CC.No.52750/2018</span><p id="p_7">




</p><p id="p_8">      5. The Complainant got examined himself as PW-1 and

got marked 6 documents as Ex.P.1 to Ex.P.6.



</p><p id="p_9">       6.    The statement as required under <a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_5">Section 313</a>         of

Cr.P.C. was dispensed as she has not properly approached the

court. Likewise, the evidence of the Accused is also treated as

not tendered.
</p>
<p id="p_10">

</p><p id="p_11">     7.      I heard the Arguments of Complainant side. The

learned counsel for the accused did not appear. Hence, the

arguments of the accused side treated as not addressed.



</p><p id="p_12">     8.        Now the following points that arise for the
consideration of this Court are :
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">          1. "Whether the Complainant proves the cheque
             issued by the accused person dishonoured with
             an endorsement as "funds insufficient" and
             inspite of service of legal notice and demand the
             accused person failed to pay the cheque
             amount within stipulated period as such she
             has committed an offence punishable under
             <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_6">Section 138</a> of Negotiable Instruments Act?"

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">          2. What order ?
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">    9. My answer to the above points are as follows :

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">             POINT No.1 : In the Affirmative
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                 5                    CC.No.52750/2018</span>


             POINT No.2 : As per final order for the following;
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">                        REASONS
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_7">    10.     POINT No.1 - The PW1 has reiterated the facts of

complaint    as ditto. Therefore, I would not like to re-discuss

such facts to avoid repetition. The oral evidence of the PW1 is

not challenged in cross-examination. The Complainant has

produced 6 documents. Ex.P.1 is the Cheque dtd.30.7.2017 for

sum of Rs.1,24,031/-.     Ex.P.2 shows that on presentation of

said Cheque was dishonoured for         funds insufficient. On

9.10.2017 the Complainant issued Legal Notice as Ex.P.3. The

Ex.P.4 and Ex.P.5 are ancillary documents to prove the

compliance of Sec.138(b) of <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_7">N.I. Act</a>. Ex.P.6 is the authorization

letter. The contents of documents are not challenged.        The

initial burden is on Complainant to prove the issuance of

Cheque is only for legally enforceable debt. The Complainant

has successfully discharged his burden of proof by producing

documentary evidence supported with oral evidence. The onus

automatically shits upon Accused to prove that such Cheque

has not been issued for legally recoverable debt. But the

Accused     has not disproved the case of the Complainant by

adducing cogent evidence. Under such circumstances, this

court has come to conclusion that the Ex.P.1 Cheque is issued
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                         6                          CC.No.52750/2018</span>


only for legally recoverable debt. Hence, the Point No.1 is

answered in the Affirmative.</blockquote><p id="p_13">
