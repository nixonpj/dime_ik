<p id="p_1"> (PER : HONOURABLE MR.JUSTICE S.R.BRAHMBHATT)


</p><p id="p_2">1.   Heard learned counsel for the parties.
</p>

<p id="p_3">2.   The petitioner by way of this petition has approached
this court with following prayers:
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_1">          "(A) That Your Lordships may be pleased to issue a
          writ of mandamus or a writ in the nature of
          mandamus or any other appropriate writ, direction
          or order, directing respondent No.3 herein to allow
          clearance of old and used tyres (reusable) imported
          by the petitioner vide Bills of Entry Nos. 6910467
          and 6910567 both dated 22.06.2018 and Bill of
          Entry No. 8948703 dated 21.11.2018 by assessing
          the Bills of Entry in accordance with the <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_1">Customs
          Act</a>, 1962;
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">          (B)  Pending hearing and final disposal of the
          present petition, Your Lordships may be pleased to

           C/SCA/18737/2018                          ORDER



            direct the respondents herein to forthwith permit
            assessment and clearance of the goods imported by
            the petitioner under Bills of Entry Nos. 6910467 and
            6910567 both dated 22.06.2018 and Bill of Entry
            No.8948703 dated 21.11.2018.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">            (C) An ex-parte ad-interim relief in terms of para
            17(B) above may kindly be granted.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">            (D)    Any other further relief as may be deemed fit
            in the facts and circumstances of the case may also
            please be granted."
</blockquote>


<p id="p_4">3.   The learned counsel for the petitioner has invited court's
attention to the averments made on oath in para 9 indicating
that the present matter is similar to the matters which have
been referred to in that paragraph wherein the interim orders
have been passed and a copy of such orders have been placed
on record        and submitted that the present subject matter
would be similar to the subject matters of those petitions, and
therefore, appropriate interim orders on those lines be
passed.
</p>

<p id="p_5">4.    This court on 5.12.2018 had issued notice and passed
the following orders:
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_5">          "Notice returnable on 12th December 2018. As the
          learned counsel has invited Court's attention to the
          earlier order passed by this Court, which is placed
          on record of this proceeding and submitted that
          unfortunately time and again the petitions have to
          be filed though the subject matters are similar.
          The concerned authorities ought to have taken
          those interim orders into consideration, which
          would have saved the undue consternation of the
          petitioner and other concerned. In that view of the
          matter, we propose to issue short notice as heavy


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                              Page 2 of 4</span>
          C/SCA/18737/2018                                         ORDER



          reliance is placed upon the earlier interim orders
          passed by this Court. It is expected of the other side
          to come forward with reply, if any else the Court
          would pass appropriate order including granting of
          interim relief in accordance with law. Direct service
          permitted."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_6">5.     The learned counsel for the respondents has placed on
record the affidavit-in-reply filed on behalf of respondents
No.2 an 3. However the learned counsel for the respondents
could not controvert the fact that this court in similar facts in
other petitions whereof orders have been placed on record
passed the similar order qua interim relief.
</p>

<p id="p_7">6.     In the aforesaid facts and circumstances of the case, we
are of the view that the reasonings of those orders granting
the interim relief, the situation being identical in this petition
also and therefore similar interim directions are issued
subject to similar conditions as in the said order.
</p>

<p id="p_8">7.     Accordingly,         the   interim     order   in   this   petition   is
required to be passed.              The respondents are directed to
permit the clearance of the goods imported by the petitioner
under Bills of Entry Nos. 6910467 and 6910567 both dated
22.06.2018 and Bill of Entry No. 8948703 dated 21.11.2018
in accordance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_2">Customs Act</a>, 1962,
subject to the following conditions:-
</p>

<p id="p_9">(i) The Customs authorities shall depute a Surveyor to check
whether the tyres are reusable with or without retreading.
</p>

<p id="p_10">(ii)   The petitioner shall not clear any goods which are not
reusable.
