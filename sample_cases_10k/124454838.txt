Respondents  

PRAYER : Writ petition filed under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India

8220 from the custody of the third respondent's police and to hand over the

:ORDER  
</pre>
<p id="p_1">Mr.V.Anand, learned Government Advocate, takes notice for the respondent.
</p>
<p id="p_2">2. By consent of both parties, this writ petition is taken up for final
disposal at the stage of admission itself.      
</p>
<p id="p_3">3.      The petitioner seeks for a writ of mandamus directing the respondents
to release his vehicle, namely, Tractor and Trailer bearing Registration No.
TN 65 AX 8220, seized on 27.06.2018 by the third respondent.
</p>
<p id="p_4">        4. According to the petitioner, even though his driver had plied the
aforesaid vehicle with all relevant documents, the third respondent has
seized the vehicle.
</p>
<p id="p_5">        5. On the other hand, it is submitted by the learned Government
Advocate appearing for the respondents that the vehicle was seized as the
same was plied without valid papers, including registration certificate books
and transport permit for transporting sand.
</p>
<p id="p_6">        6. In any event, as the vehicle is under the custody of the respondents
having been seized on 27.06.2018 and considering the fact that if the same is
allowed to be kept idle by exposing the same to sun and rain, it would
certainly diminish its value.  Therefore, pending proceedings before the
respondents, this Court is of the view that the vehicle can be released by
imposing certain conditions on the petitioner for release of the aforesaid
vehicle.
</p>
<p id="p_7">        7. Accordingly, the first respondent is directed to release the vehicle
in question to the petitioner within a period of seven days from the date of
receipt of a copy of this order subject to the following conditions:
?(i)    The petitioner shall produce documents before the first respondent
under whose custody the vehicle is kept, to establish the ownership of the
vehicle in question;
</p><p id="p_8">(ii)    The petitioner shall deposit a sum of          Rs.10,000/- (Rupees Ten
thousand only) before the first respondent herein;
</p><p id="p_9">(iii)   The petitioner shall give an undertaking that he will not use the
vehicle for any illegal activities in future and shall produce the same as
and when required by the respondents;
</p><p id="p_10">(iv)    On doing so, the vehicle in question shall be returned to the
petitioner;
</p><p id="p_11">(v)     The petitioner shall not alienate the vehicle in question till the
disposal of the proceedings before the authority concerned;
</p><p id="p_12">(vi)    The first respondent  is directed to complete the enquiry within a
period of four weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of this order; and
</p><p id="p_13">(vii)   The petitioner is also directed to participate in the enquiry to be
conducted by the first respondent.?
</p>
<p id="p_14">        8. The writ petition is ordered accordingly.  No costs.
</p>
