Original Application No.202/00935/2016.

     The issue before the Tribunal was whether a

Plumber     by     order      dated      18/01/1980,          w.e.f.

Delhi High Court in Writ Petition(Civil)No.2792/1998

decided on 25/09/1988 which led the Directorate

General Central Public Works Department to issue

Office Memorandum No. F.No.19/117/2001(PL) dated

09/06/2011          and     the             Office       Memorandum

No.08/1/2012-EC-X dated 12/07/2012 stipulating that

"As   selection     grade        is    to     be     treated     as     one

promotion/upgradation for the purpose of grant of

ACP/MACP, 2nd MACP may be granted to Direct

Recruit workers on completion of 18 years of service

(8+10) and 3rd MACP after 28 years (8+10+10). And

contending inter alia that without adhering to the

stipulation    in    the     Office          Memorandum                dated

12/07/2012, the employer rejected the claim by order

dated 06/01/2016, sought the following reliefs:

         illegal    and    the        same    may       kindly   be
         quashed.
</p><p id="p_3">              8.2     That, a direction may kindly be
         given to the respondents to grant the
         benefit of selection grade w.e.f. 22.1.1988,
         Second MACP in pay scale of 4500-7000
         w.e.f. 22.1.1998 and Third MACP in Grade

        directed to re-calculate the entire retrial
        dues of the applicant no.2 considering the
        aforesaid benefits and also revise the
        pension of the applicant no.2 accordingly.
</p><p id="p_4">             8.3   That,     the   respondents        may
        further be directed to pay the arrears of
        aforesaid revision with 12 % p.a. interest
        as early as possible.
</p><p id="p_5">             8.4   Any other suitable relief which
        this Hon'ble    Tribunal may deem fit and
        proper in the circumstances of the case
        may also be given to the applicant along
        with cost of this litigation. "
</p><p id="p_6">     The Tribunal, on the finding that since the

Government has taken a decision on 12/07/2012 to

treat selection grade as one promotion/upgradation

for the purpose of grant of ACP/MACP, 2nd MACP may

be granted to Direct Recruit workers on completion

of 18 years of service (8+10) and 3rd MACP after 28

years   (8+10+10),         disposed       of    the     Original

Application with a direction to the respondent

(present Petitioner) to reconsider the claim.

</p><p id="p_7">     Though, it is contended on behalf of the

Appellant that the Tribunal grossly erred in directing

to consider the claim of the respondent; however,

learned counsel for the petitioner since fails to

     commend                at   any   cogent   material   evidence    to

     establish that the order dated 12/07/2012 has been

     superseded, the Tribunal in our considered opinion

     was within its right in directing for reconsideration,

     as would warrant any interference.

</p><p id="p_8">                 Consequently, petition fails and is dismissed. No

     costs.</p><pre id="pre_2">
