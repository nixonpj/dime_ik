<p id="p_1">            This is a revision petition instituted by Rinku son of Satnarayan,

who was held guilty for committing offence punishable under <a href="/doc/1868826/" id="a_1">Section 498</a>

IPC, vide judgment dated 17.12.2015, passed by the Judicial Magistrate First

Class, Narnaul and by order of sentence dated 18.12.2015, he was sentenced

to undergo simple imprisonment for a period of one year.

</p><p id="p_2">            Aggrieved, the petitioner preferred an appeal against the

aforesaid judgment, however, the appeal was dismissed by learned

Additional Sessions Judge, Narnaul by order dated 16.12.2017 affirming the

judgment of conviction and order of sentence passed by the trial Court.

</p><p id="p_3">            Against the impugned judgments dated 17.12.2015 and

16.12.2017, passed by the trial Court as well as by the appellate Court,

accused Rinku has come up in this revision petition before this Court.

<p id="p_5">marriage of complainant Vijay Kumar was solemnized with Smt. Shivani on

05.07.2006 as per Hindu rites and rituals. After marriage, they were residing

as husband and wife in village Mosnuta, Tehsil Narnaul. Out of this wedlock,

a female child, namely Sonia, was born on 27.05.2008. Complainant was

working in Army Canteen for the last 10 years and he used to come to his

village from time to time. The complainant was in Rajasthan in connection

with his job. On 03.10.2011, her wife Shivani, after giving intoxicating

substance to the family members, fled away from her matrimonial home

along with minor daughter. Complainant was intimated about this fact by his

brother. Complainant came to his village, however, before his arrival, his

brother filed a complaint with the Nizampur, Police Post on 04.10.2011 to

the effect that Rinku (petitioner herein) took away Shivani and minor

daughter. Complaints were also lodged with DGP, Haryana and ADGP,

Crime Branch, Haryana, Superintendent of Police, Narnaul, however, no

action was taken thereunder. Shivani and Rinku performed marriage on

04.10.2011 despite knowing that earlier marriage is in existence. Since no

action was taken by the police authorities, the complainant filed a complaint

to the Court of JMIC, Narnaul.

<p id="p_6">             After preliminary evidence and pre-charge evidence led by the

complainant, a prima-facie case under <a href="/doc/1833006/" id="a_2">Sections 497</a> and <a href="/doc/1868826/" id="a_3">498</a> of the IPC

against the accused Rinku was made out and he was charge-sheeted

accordingly. Since the accused-petitioner did not want to cross-examine any

witness in after charge evidence, hence, the after-charge evidence was

closed. In the statement, recorded under <a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_4">Section 313</a> Cr.P.C., the accused-

petitioner denied the allegations levelled against him and pleaded his

innocence.</p><pre id="pre_2">

entire evidence and material on record, the petitioner was firstly convicted by

the learned trial Court and thereafter the judgment of conviction was

maintained by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Narnaul as mentioned

above.

material on record.

No. 1/complainant despite service.
</p>
<p id="p_10">             After    arguing   for      sometime,   learned   counsel   for   the

petitioner/revisionist contended that in-fact the petitioner has already

undergone substantive period of his sentence. The total period of sentence

awarded is one year. Accused-revisionist has already faced protracted trial.

Counsel for the petitioner does not assail the findings of the conviction

recorded against the petitioner by both the Courts below in case the sentence

of the petitioner is reduced to the one already undergone by him.

</p><p id="p_11">             Ms. Gaganpreet Kaur, AAG, Haryana, opposes this prayer while

submitting that there is no infirmity in the orders so passed.

</p><p id="p_12">             There is little scope of the High Court interfering in the revision

petition filed as there is no infirmity in the orders passed. From the custody

certificate, placed on file today in the Court, it is evident that the petitioner

has already undergone 04 months and 26 days inclusive of remissions of 15

days. The total period of sentence awarded is one year. The case is of the

year 2011. The petitioner has faced protracted trial. During the period of trial,

the petitioner has undergone agony of trial. Under these circumstances, I am

of the considered view that the ends of justice would be met in case the order
