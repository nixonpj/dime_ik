<p id="p_2">	2		The petitioner is a dealer in LPG Gas Stoves and Accessories at Arakonam and registered on the file of the respondent under the provisions of the Tamil Nadu Value Added Tax Act, 2006.  The petitioner has questioned the order of assessment for the year 2012-2013 dated 10.12.2015.

The petitioner would plead that the nature of transaction done by them are all properly accounted for and got their Books of Accounts and Documents and the impugned proceedings itself is a result of obtaining an information from the official website of the Department, for which, proper details were not furnished to the petitioner.  Therefore, the learned counsel for the petitioner pleads that one more opportunity may be granted to the petitioner so as to enable the petitioner to go and explain the Assessing Officer that the Returns filed by them for the relevant year was proper and valid.
