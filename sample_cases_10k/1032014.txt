                                      JUDGMENT
</pre>


<p id="p_1">       In   this   appeal   preferred   from   the   Central   Prison,



Thiruvananthapuram, the appellant who is  the accused in S.C. No.



494/01  on the file of the Addl. Sessions Judge  for the Trial of



Abkari   Act   Cases,   Neyyattinkara,   challenges   the   conviction   entered



and   the   sentence   passed   against   the   appellant   for   an   offence



punishable under Sec. 58 of the  Abkari Act.
</p>


<p id="p_2">       2.     The   case   of   the   prosecution   is   that   on     1-5-1998   at



about   1   p.m.   on   the   kuttappu-Amboori   public   road   in   front   of



Amboori     Village   Office     at   Kovilloor   Desom   the   accused   was



found   in   possession   of   10   litres   of     illicit   arrack   in   a   jerry   can



and   that   the   accused   has     thereby   committed   an   offence



punishable under Sec. 58 of the  Abkari Act.
</p>


<p id="p_3">       3.     On   the   accused   pleading   not   guilty   to   the   charge



framed   against   him     by   the   court   below   for   the   aforementioned


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">Crl. A. No. 1457 of  2006               -:2:-</span>


offences,   the   prosecution   was   permitted   to   adduce   evidence   in



support   of   its   case.     The   prosecution   examined   6   witnesses   as



P.Ws   1   to   6   and   got   marked   6   documents   as   Exts.   P1   to   P6



and one  material object as MO1.
</p>


<p id="p_4">      4.     After the close of the prosecution evidence the accused



was   questioned   under   Sec.   313   (1)(b)   <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_1">Cr.P.C</a>.   with   regard   to   the



incriminating    circumstances  appearing  against  him in  the  evidence



for the prosecution.  He died those circumstances  and maintained



his innocence.
</p>


<p id="p_5">      5.     Since   the   trial   judge   did   not   consider   this   a   fit   case



for   recording   an   order   of   acquittal   under   Sec.   232   <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_2">Cr.P.C</a>.   the



accused was called upon to enter on his defence and  to adduce



any   evidence     which   he   might   have     in   support   thereof.     The



accused examined the Village Officer, Arimboor Village as D.W.1.
</p>


<p id="p_6">      6.     The   learned   Addl.   Sessions   Judge,   after   trial,   as   per



judgment   dated   24-5-2006   found   the   appellant     guilty   of   the



offence   alleged   against     him   and   sentenced   him   to   undergo



rigorous   imprisonment   for   two   years   and   to   pay   fine   of   Rs.
</p>


<p id="p_7">1,00,000/-   and   on   default   to   pay   fine,     to   suffer   rigorous



imprisonment   for   three  months.     It  is   the  said  judgment   which  is


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">Crl. A. No. 1457 of  2006               -:3:-</span>


assailed in this appeal.
</p>


<p id="p_8">      7.     I heard Advocate Sri. Pradeep K.P., the learned counsel



who   defended     the   appellant     on   State   Brief   and   Adv.   Sri.



Sivakumar, the learned Public Prosecutor,  who defended the State.
</p>


<p id="p_9">      8.       The   only   point   which   arises   for   consideration   in   this



appeal is as to   whether the conviction entered and the sentence



passed  against the appellant are sustainable or not ?
</p>


<p id="p_10">      THE POINT:
</p>


<p id="p_11">      9.     P.W.1   was   the     Excise  Preventive   Officer   of   Amaravila



Excise   Range.     He   detected   the   offence.     He   proved     Ext.P1



mahazar .     MO1    jerry  can    was  marked through  him.    P.W2



is none other than the son of the accused who was examined as



an   independent   witness.     He   not   only   turned   hostile   to   the



prosecution   but   even   went   to   the   extent   of   denying   his   signature



in Ext.P1 mahazar. P.W.3 was the Excise   Preventive Officer who



had   accompanied   P.W.1.     He   is   also   a   signatory   to   Ext.P1



mahazar   and     identified   MO1   jerry   can.       P.W.4   is   the   Excise



inspector   who   recorded   Ext.P2   crime   and   occurrence   report   and



registered   the     Crime   as   C.R.15/98     of   Amaravila   Excise   Range.
</p>


<p id="p_12">Ext.P3 remand report   and   P4 thondi list   were marked through


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">Crl. A. No. 1457 of  2006               -:4:-</span>


him.           P.W.5     was   the   Excise   Inspector   who       investigated



the   case.     P.W.6   was   the   thondi   section   clerk   attached     to   the



committal   Magistrate.     He   proved   Ext.P6   relevant   entry   in   the



thondi register.
</p>


<p id="p_13">      10.    After hearing both sides and after bestowing my anxious



consideration     to   the   oral   and   documentary   evidence,   I   am   not



satisfied that the prosecution has succeeded in bringing home  the



guilt of the  accused beyond reasonable doubt.
</p>


<p id="p_14">      11.    Even   if   the   evidence   of   P.Ws   1   and   3   regarding   the



arrest,   search   and   seizure     could   be   relied   on,   there   is   no



connecting  link  evidence  to   conclusively  establish  the  guilt of the



accused.   Going  by  Ext.P1 contemporaneous  mahazar  prepared by



P.w.1   from   the   scene   of   detection   itself     P.W.1   had   affixed   a



label   on   the   jerry   can   and   had   obtained   the   signature   of   the



accused and the witnesses on the said label.   But P.W.1 had to



confess   that     the   label   on   MO1   jerry   can   does   not   contain   the



signature of the accused.    When confronted with this infirmity he



went to the  extent of saying that  the recitals in Ext.P1 mahazar



to the contrary are not true.   It cannot therefore be   conclusively



concluded   that MO1 jerry can   produced in court   was the one


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">Crl. A. No. 1457 of  2006               -:5:-</span>


allegedly   carried   by   the   accused   on   the   date   of   detection.     The



jerry   can   which   was   allegedly   seized   from   the   possession   of   the



accused  under  Ext.P1  mahazar  was  produced  before  the  court  on



1-5-1998  itself   as  revealed  by  Ext.P4     thondi     list.   There    is



an   endorsement     by   the   Magistrate     on   Ext.P4     thondi   list   as



follows:-
</p>


<blockquote id="blockquote_1">             "After taking the sample the MOs may be kept



             in the police station" .</blockquote>



<p id="p_15">      12.    This   endorsement   is   made   on   2-5-1998.   But   there   is



nothing   on   record   to   show     that   the   above   direction   of   the



Magistrate   was     complied   with.     Ext.P6   is   the   relevant   entry   in



the   thondi   register   maintained   by   the   committal   Magistrate.     The



said entry also shows that on 1-5-1998  a  10 litre jerry can full



of   arrack   was   received   in   court   as     T.   No.   96/98.     The



aforementioned endorsement   dated 2-5-1998   of the Magistrate is



re-produced   on   the   right   hand   side  of   Ext.P6.     In  the   middle  of



that page there is an endorsement as follows:
</p>


<pre id="pre_2">                             "                  "



This   endorsement   is   signed   by   P.W.6     and   is   dated   1-7-1998.



P.W.6     is   the   thondi   section   clerk   who   claims   to   have   taken


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">Crl. A. No. 1457 of  2006               -:6:-</span>


sample     in   this   case.     She   stated   that     Ext.P6   contains   her



</pre><p id="p_16">signature below the endorsement  referred to above.   The above



endorsement     in   malayalam   means   that   the   sample   was   taken



possession  of .   If P.W.6 herself    had  taken the sample  in this



case there was no need for her to take possession of the sample



on   1-7-1998.     The   prosecution   has     no   case   that   after     taking



the sample from the  jerry can it was returned to be kept in the



police station.   If as a matter of fact the property was returned,



then   necessarily     an   endorsement   to   that   effect   ought   to   have



been     made     in   the   property   register.     But   Ext.P6     does   not



show any such endorsement .   P.W.6 has not given the date on



which   she   had   taken   the   sample.     Nor   has   she   deposed   about



the     manner   of   sampling   or   whether   she   had   despatched   the



sample to the  Chemical Examiner's  laboratory after  packing and



sealing  the  same.       All that   she  says  is that  she  had  taken



the   sample.         Being   the   thondy   section   clerk     (property   clerk),



she   would   have     handled   innumerable   items   of   properties     and



would   have   taken   samples   from   several   bulk   quantities   of



contraband   liquors.     there   is   no   particular   reason   for   her   to



remember   the   sampling   in   this   case.     The  ipsi   dixit  of   P.W.5


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">Crl. A. No. 1457 of  2006               -:7:-</span>


cannot   be   the   final   word   on   this       aspect   since   there   is   no



contemporaneous     written   record   maintained   by   the     committal



Magistrate    showing  that  the sampling  was   done  in  this   case  on



a particular  day      or was  done  by P.W.6 or was  dispatched  by



P.W.6 after     packing    and sealing the  same.     If   we go by



the   endorsement   on   Ext.P6,   as   mentioned   earlier,   there   was   no



occasion   for   P.W.   6   to   take     over   the   sample   on   1-7-1998   and



the   does not make any sense  if  P.W.6 was the member of



the staff who  had  taken  the sample  pursuant  to the  directions  of



the Magistrate.   Ext.P5 report of analysis   no doubt   refers to a



letter   dated   1-7-1998   from   the   committal   Magistrate  received   along



with the sample containing 150 ml.  of colourless liquid but Ext.P5



does   not   indicate   the   date     on   which     the   sample   in  this   case



was  taken  or the   person  who had  taken  the   sample.        Ext.P5



only     proves   that   the   sample   received       thereunder   on   analysis



was found to contain 37.03  percent by volume of Ethyl Alcohol.
</p>


<p id="p_17">      13.    Prosecution   can   succeed     only   if   it   is   able   to   prove



that   the   sample   drawn     from   the   bulk   quantity   of   the   alleged



contraband     liquor   said   to   have   been   possessed   by   the   accused



and   which   had   changed   several   hands,     was   dispatched   in   a


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">Crl. A. No. 1457 of  2006               -:8:-</span>


tamper proof condition  to the chemical   examiner   and  the  same



sample,     on   analysis,     was   found   to   contain   Ethyl   Alcochol.
</p>


<p id="p_18">There is no contemporaneous record  proved in the case to show



that   it   was   P.W.6   who   had   taken   the   sample     in   this   case.
</p>


<p id="p_19">Even   if   P.W.6   had   taken   the   sample,   it   is   not   shown   that   the



sample   taken   by   P.W.6   had     been   despatched   to   the   chemical



examiner    in a tamper proof  condition particularly when it must



have   changed   several   hands.     It   was   initially   handled   by   P.W.6



If she is to be believed   the sample was thereafter handled  by



an   Excise Guard referred to Ext.P5 certificate.     It must    have



thereafter   been   handled     by   the   chemical   examiner   concerned.
</p>


<p id="p_20">Therefore,   unless   the   prosecution   is   able   to   show     that     the



sample   which   was       analysed     by   the   chemical     examiner   was



the very same sample which was drawn from the contraband liquor



allegedly seized  from the accused, no conviction can  safely  be



recorded against the accused.   (See    The  State  of Rajasthan  v.
</p>


<p id="p_21">Daulat Ram - Vide AIR 1980 SC 1314 and  <a href="/doc/103475025/" id="a_3">Valsala v. State of



Kerala</a> - 1993 (2) KLT 550).
</p>


<p id="p_22">      14.    Even on the facts alleged by the prosecution evidence,



at best, the offence which would have been         attracted   was


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">Crl. A. No. 1457 of  2006               -:9:-</span>


one   either   punishable   under   Sec.   8(2)   of   the   Abkari   Act   or   one



punishable     under   Sec.   55(a)   of   the     Abkari   Act.       An   offence



punishable under Sec. 58 of the Abkari Act is neither attracted nor



proved in this case.  For this reason also the conviction recorded



by the court below cannot be  sustained.
</p>


<p id="p_23">       15.    In   the   result,   the   conviction   entered   and   the   sentence



passed  against the appellant are  set  aside  and  the    appellant  is



found   not   guilty   of   the   offence   punishable   under   Sec.   58   of   the



Abkari Act and is acquitted thereunder.  He is set at liberty.  He



shall   be   released   from   prison   forthwith     unless   his   continued

<p id="p_25">       17.      Before   parting   with   this   case   I   have   an   important



duty   to   perform.   This   Court   has   come   across   various   cases



involving prosecution under the Abkari Act.  Invariably in most  of



the cases   it has been noticed that there is no contemporaneous



record   maintained   in     any   of   the     court   of   the     committal



Magistrate  regarding the process of sampling.  Ordinarily, it is the



thondi section clerk who is entrusted with the duty of receiving the



material   objects   and   dealing   with   the   same.     It   should   be


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">Crl. A. No. 1457 of  2006                  -:10:-</span>


discernible   from   the   records     maintained   by   the   Magistrate   that



there   was   a   direction   by   the   Magistrate   to   take   sample     and



indicating the quantity to be taken.   Where such  directions  are



carried   out   by   the   thondi   section   clerk,     it   should   be   discernible



from   the   records   maintained   in   the   court.     Such   records   should



reveal the actual act of sampling  and the packing and sealing  of



the   sample   and   the   despatch   of   the   sample   to   the   chemical



examiner's   laboratory   after   affixing   the   seal   thereon   and   the



separate   despatch   of   the   specimen   seal   to   the     chemical



examiner's   laboratory   enabling   the   laboratory   to   verify   and   receive



the sample  after ascertaining  whether  the seal  on  the packet and



the   specimen   seal   separately   received   tallied   and   also   after



verifying   whether     the   seal   on   the   packet   was   intact.         The



prosecution   should   get   the   copy   of   the   forwarding   note   or



requisition   for   chemical   analysis   marked   during     trial.     The



prosecution   should   also   be   able   to     get   marked   during   trial   the



office     copy   of   the   covering   letter   of   the   Magistrate   while



despatching   the   sample.                             In   case   there   are   no



contemporaneous   records   regarding   the   sampling   process   the



prosecution   should   be   able   to     cite   the   thondi     section   clerk


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">Crl. A. No. 1457 of  2006                 -:11:-</span>


concerned   so   that   the   prosecution   may   not   fail   due   to   want   of



link   evidence,     as   in   this   case.       In   a   case   where   the     bulk



quantity   of   contraband   substance   cannot   be   retained   in   the   court



due   to   paucity   of     space   or   due   to     fire   hazard   it   is   certainly



open   to   the   Magistrate   to   return   the   bulk   quantity   after   taking



sample   therefrom   to   the   investigating   officer   for   safe   custody.
</p>


<p id="p_26">While   doing   so,     there   should   be     records   evidencing   the



directions   issued   in   that   behalf   and   the   compliance   of   the   same.
</p>


<p id="p_27">In this case    even though the Magistrate   had directed to return



material object after taking sample therefrom,  there is nothing  to



indicate   that   the   material   object   was   in   fact     returned.   If   the



material   object   had   been   returned   as   directed,     there   should   be



contemporaneous   records   maintained   by   the   Magistrate   to   indicate



the member of the staff who had complied with the direction.  In



a   case   where   the     material   objects   are     returned   to   the



investigating officer there should be a clear direction while returning



the   same   to   produce   the   same   before   court     as   and   when



required.       In   such   cases,       there   should   be   clear   written



direction issued by the Magistrate or by the trial court calling upon



the   investigating   officer   to   produce   the     material   object   back   in


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">Crl. A. No. 1457 of  2006                -:12:-</span>


court   for   the   purpose   of   trial   .     The   investigating   officers   while



producing   the   properties   in   compliance   of   such   directions   should



also,     while   complying   with   such   directions   produce   the   material



object along with a report  giving the present status and condition



of the material object.  The various steps  in this regard  cannot



be   performed   in   a   vacuum.    There   should   be   records   discernible



in   the   court   in   which   case   only   the   presumption   regarding



regularity   of   official     acts   can   come   to   the   rescue   of   the



prosecution.

or a gist  of the   same  in the form  of official   memorandum,  to



all   the   Magistrates   and   Sessions   Courts   for   information,   future



guidance and compliance.
