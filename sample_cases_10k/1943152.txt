ORAL
ORDER</pre> 

 

<p id="p_1">The
present petition is filed by one Shri Patel Dineshbhai Bhudarbhai as
legal heir and administrator of property of one Shri Patel Bhudarbhai
Khemabhai praying to:
</p> 

 


 


<p id="p_2"> 8(A)
This Hon'ble Court be pleased to issue a writ of certiorari and/or
any other appropriate writ, order or direction in the nature of
certiorari quashing and setting aside the order dated 16/07/2009
passed in Civil Misc. Appeal No.11/2009 and be pleased to restore
order passed below Exhibit-5 in Regular Civil Suit No.6 of 2005 dated
13/03/2007. 
</p> 


 


 

<p id="p_3">After
hearing the matter initially this Court (Coram:Hon'ble Smt. Justice
Abhilasha Kumari) passed an order on 16.12.2009 which reads as under:
</p> 

 


 


<p id="p_4"> Mr.
</p><p id="p_5">Harnish V. Darji, learned counsel for the petitioner has submitted
that the order of the Trial Court, below Exh.5, whereby the said
application has been partly-allowed is just and proper, as the said
application has been allowed by directing that respondent
No.1(original defendant No.1) may not remove the construction of the
petitioner, without following the proper legal procedure. It is
further submitted that respondent No.1 has not put in an appearance
in the suit, though served, and there is no evidence on record to
establish that the respondent No.2 has any right over the disputed
land. 
</p>
 


<p id="p_6">In
view of the above submissions, Notice returnable on 8th
February, 2010. 
</p>
 


<p id="p_7">Ad-interim
relief in terms of paragraph No.8(B) is granted till then. 
</p>
 


<p id="p_8">Direct
Service is permitted .
</p> 


 


 


 


 

<p id="p_9">After
hearing the matter this Court passed an order on 10.3.2010 which
reads as under:
</p> 

 


 


<p id="p_10">  Notice
to
respondent no.1-Gothva Gram Panchayat returnable on 30th
March
2010. The Talati cum Mantri is directed to remain personally present
before this Court with all the relevant papers of this case.  A
copy of this order be made available to learned Assistant Government
Pleader Mr.Pathak for its communication to the Office of the
Mamlatdar, Taluka Visnagar, District Mehsana  for
necessary action   in
the matter and to see that the Talati Cum Mantri remains present
before this Court at 11.00 AM on 30 th 
 March
2010 .
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_11">Today
when the matter is called out, one Mr. J.S. Mogal is present before
the Court who declares before the Court that he is Talati cum Mantri
of Gothva Gram Panchayat. He further states that he has taken charge
as Talati cum Mantri of Gothva Gram Panchayat on 1.10.2007. He is in
Government service since 18.11.1982. His approach to the problem
which is ventilated in the petition is totally ' indifferent'.
He has not come prepared. He has not come with the required papers
and whatever little paper he has brought are not studied by him. This
is nothing but 'failure' on his part in discharging the duties which
he is supposed to discharge as a Government Officer.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_12">District
Development Officer, Mehsana is directed to take note of the
aforesaid observations and take necessary departmental proceedings
against such officer for being non-cooperative, indifferent and
unconcerned approach on his part though his presence was sought to
render necessary assistance. The District Development Officer after
taking necessary action, shall place the report before this Court on
30.4.2010.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_13">Another
officer present before the Court is one Mr. V.A. Patel who declares
before the Court that he is Mamlatdar, Visnagar. He is yet another
officer who depicted a totally irresponsible behaviour in the Court.
When a letter dated 5.2.2007 from the office of Taluka Panchayat
addressed to the Deputy DDO is shown to the officer, he made a
statement before the Court that, ' he is not concerned with the
subject matter of the letter, it is ' some '
communication from the Taluka Panchayat to the office of Deputy DDO
and he is not required to do anything pertaining to the contents of
the letter'. Though the letter was made available to him he did
not take trouble to read the same and render any assistance to the
Court.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_14">By
order dated 10.3.2010 the learned AGP was directed to communicate to
the office of the Mamlatdar, Taluka Visnagar, District Mehsana about
the subject matter of the petition and it was expected of the office
of the Mamlatdar to take necessary action in the matter, if not
directly, then indirectly by bringing the subject matter of the
petition to the notice of the concerned officer of the Government.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_15">This
Court is at pains to observe that an officer of the rank of Mamlatdar
is behaving in such irresponsible manner that too before the High
Court. Not only the courtesy which is expected from an officer of the
Government is absent, he is exhibiting a very irresponsible behaviour
with similar expression on his face.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_16">The
Principal Secretary, Revenue Department, Sachivalaya, Gandhinagar is
directed to take note of the above observations and take necessary
departmental proceedings against this officer for the indifferent and
irresponsible approach on his part in the matter pertaining to the
property of the Government which is alleged to have been not only
encroached upon but subsequently sold off, as is clear from the
aforesaid communication dated 5.2.2007 written by the Taluka
panchayat to the office of Deputy DDO bearing No.Taluka
Panchayat/VP/Vashi/412/413/2007. The Principal Secretary, Revenue
Department, Sachivalaya, Gandhinagar, to place the report of the
action taken in the matter before this Court on 30.4.2010.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_17">After
exhibiting such non-cooperative behaviour when the learned AGP
explained to the officer the consequence which may follow, the
Mamlatdar took trouble to look into the letter and then said that he
will see if anything can be done in the matter.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_18">The
Registry is directed to send a copy of this order to the Secretary,
Revenue Department, Sachivalaya, Gandhinagar and also to the DDO,
District Panchayat, Mehsana.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_19">The
matter is adjourned to 15.4.2010.
</p>
