                             COMMON JUDGMENT
     ORAL JUDGMENT
                       
</p><p id="p_2">     1.     The land owners     have filed these Petitions questioning the common
     Judgment dated 27.9.1996 delivered by the M.R.T. Mumbai in two Revision
      


     Applications numbered as Tenancy A.76 of 1995 and Tenancy No.A-189 of
   



     1995. These Revisions were field by the deceased Respondent no.1 challenging
     the order dated 12.12.1994 passed by the Forest Settlement Officer, Sawantwadi
     and order dated 28.2.1991 passed by the S.D.O.Sawantwadi. Nobody has





     appeared for legal heirs of deceased Respondent no.1. The AGP has opposed the
     Petition on behalf of the Respondent no.2 State of Maharashtra and its Officers.
</p>




<p id="p_3">     2.      Mr.Karandikar, learned counsel for the Petitioner submits that the
     agricultural lands belonging to the present Petitioner were let out to the deceased
     Respondent no.1 and he was declared to be deemed purchaser. He was expected
     to pay purchase price in 12 instalments of Rs.689/- plus yearly interest from 1974
     and last instalment was payable on 22.9.1986. He did not pay the single




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                                         ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 19:26:55 :::</span>

     wp373.374.97

     instalment and was in arrears of Rs.14179/- including interest arrears. The




                                                                             
     Additional Tahasildar therefore issued final Notice on 2.2.1991 called upon him
     to credit the entire amount. The notice was ignored and hence the Tahasildar by




                                                    
     his order dated 20.2.1991 declared purchase in effective under section 32A of the
     Bombay Tenancy and Agricultural Lands Act, 1948. (Hereinafter referred to as
     1948 Act). But then, he forfeited the land to State Government.                This was




                                                   
     questioned by the landlord and the Appellate Authority thereafter corrected that
     error and restored the lands to the Petitioners. In due course of time, Petitioners
     sold those lands to one Harekar. Thus, according to the learned counsel during




                                       
     the pendency of Revision before MRT the Petitioners were not owners of the said
                        
     land and land was/is in possession of subsequent purchaser Harekar.
</p>                       
<p id="p_4">     3.     The order of the Tahasildar forfeiting land to the State Government was
     challenged by the Tenant also independently before the S.D.O. Sawantwadi. The
     Appeal was dismissed and the Appellate Authority directed the Additional
      

     Tahasildar to implement the order passed in favour of the Petitioner-landlord in
     their Appeal. Both these orders were then challenged belatedly without preferring
   



     any application for condonation of delay. M.R.T. has condoned the delay only on
     the strength of the Affidavit and that too while deciding the Revision finally.
</p>




<p id="p_5">     Thus the order condoning the delay and allowing the Revision is one and same.
     Mr.Karandikar therefore submits that Petitioner did not get proper opportunity to
     oppose the prayer to have the delay condoned. In the alternative and without
     prejudice, he submits that the M.R.T. has not recorded any reasons for condoning





     such huge delay and therefore order is non-speaking. He points out that M.R.T.
     has relied upon Judgment of the learned Single Judge reported at 1990 (1)
     Bom.C.R 705. (<a href="/doc/1308373/" id="a_1">Tribhavandas Jeevraj Patel vs Babu Govind Ghatal</a>)) He
     submits that said Judgment does not consider the facts like present one. Here




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                                     ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 19:26:55 :::</span>

     wp373.374.97

     according to him, the Tahasildar gave all opportunities to the tenant to pay the




                                                                            
     instalments and to clear the amounts. That opportunity was not availed of. The
     tenant did not even bother to appear before the Tahasildar and in this situation




                                                    
     order declaring purchase to be ineffective cannot be said to be without
     justification and jurisdiction. He has also relied upon provisions of section 32K
     (1A) and 1 (B) to submit that law has made necessary provisions for such




                                                   
     Tenant who remains in default. The Respondent tenant ought to have appeared
     before the Tahasildar expressed his difficulties and then sought extention of time
     and cleared the arrears or then sought suitable instalments. The provisions of




                                       
     section 32K (3) cannot be interpreted in the mode and manner which would
                        
     result in defeating this scheme and intention in section 32K (A) and 1 (B).
</p>                       
<p id="p_6">     4.     In this situation, according to him there was no merit in the Revisions
     filed and impugned judgment is therefore liable to be quashed and set aside.
</p>      

<p id="p_7">     5.     The learned AGP has invited attention to the impugned judgment to show
     that prayer for condonation of delay was not seriously opposed and in the
   



     Petition, there is nothing to show that Petitioner was not given him necessary
     opportunity The consideration of the scheme of section 32K by the learned





     Single Judge of this Court in the Judgment between <a href="/doc/1308373/" id="a_2">Tribhavandas Jeevraj Patel
     vs Babu Govind Ghatal</a> 1990 (1) Bom.C.R.705. is pressed into service to show
     that on merits the view taken by the MRT is just and proper. It is submitted that
     requirement of section 32K (3) is failure to pay at the end of revenue recovery





     proceedings. Thus the arrears of purchase price are to be recovered as arrears of
     land revenue and purchase becomes ineffective by reason of failure to pay
     purchase price as declared in section 32K. The learned AGP therefore prays for
     dismissal of Writ Petition.

</p><p id="p_9">     6.      After hearing Respective Counsel, I find that in the impugned Judgment




                                                       
     dated 27.9.1996 in para 6 the delay has been condoned in the course of recording
     or delivering it. The provisions of 1979 Act prescribe the time limit of 60 days
     from the date of the impugned order for preferring such a Revision. The order




                                                      
     dated 12.12.1994 as also order dated 28.2.1991 were both assailed in Revisions
     which were filed respectively on 4.5.1995 and 18.5.1995. Thus challenge to
     February 1991 order in May 1991 is almost after four years.
</p>



                                         
<p id="p_10">     7.     In this background, when para 6 of the judgment by which delay has been
                        
     condoned is perused it shows that counsel appearing for Revision Applicant had
     explained delay in filing the Revision Application by filing an affidavit and
                       
     request was made to condone the delay. The M.R.T. records that as the delay in
     filing the Revision Application was properly explained, it has condoned it. Thus
     facts disclosed in the affidavit are no where apparent and how those facts were
      


     found just and sufficient to condone the delay is also not apparent,. Entire para 6
   



     except name of the advocate, can be used to condone the delay in any other
     matter. In short, application of mind by M.R.T. to those facts to enable this court
     to gather its thought process is lacking in this matter.
</p>




<p id="p_11">     8.     The law in this respect is well settled. When there is delay, the Tribunal
     has to first proceed to consider its condonation. It gets jurisdiction to consider
     the controversy on merits only after such delay is condoned, Here consideration





     of merits as also consideration of the prayer for condonation of delay is
     simultaneous.    View of this Court in <a href="/doc/416866/" id="a_3">M.M.College of Science vs R.T.Borkar</a>

<p id="p_12">     9.       In view of these findings, it is not necessary for this Court to consider




                                                           
     whether the Petitioner was given proper opportunity to oppose the prayer for
     condonation of delay,. The M.R.T. has not recorded that the landlords had given
     no objection and therefore delay was condoned. Looking to the nature of

     given by the Petitioner.

<p id="p_13">     10.      In this view of the matter, the impugned judgment dated 27.9.1996 in both
     Revision Applications unsustainable. The same is accordingly quashed and set aside.
