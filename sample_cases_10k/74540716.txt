</pre>
<p id="p_1">          Accused Mahender @ Babboo has been sent to face

 occurrence. He met Hari Ram S/o Lalta Parsad, a Tea Vendor at

the spot. Sh. Hari Ram made statement to the effect that on the

intervening night of 12/13.8.2006 at about 12.00 (midnight)

while he was present at his rehri, one person Liyakat came

towards his rehri holding his stomach. When he inquired from

Liyakat as to what had happened, he was informed that Babboo,

Safai Karamchari had stabbed him and that he was going to

Irwin Hospital in a rickshaw. Specifically stating that as Liyakat

used to take teat from him and Babboo used to do the cleaning

job, both were known to him and that necessary legal action may

be taken in the matter. On the basis of the statement of Hari

Ram, FIR No.580/06 was registered. During investigation of the

case, spot was got photographed, injured was examined and

accused Babboo @ Mahender was arrested and after completion

of the investigation, chargesheet was filed against the accused.

</p><p id="p_2">2.         After compliance of provisions of Sec. 207 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_3">CrPC</a>, the

case was committed to the Court of Sessions.
</p>
<p id="p_3">3.         After hearing on the point of charge, accused

Mahender @ Babboo was charged on 18.5.2007 for the offence

punishable under Sec.307 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_4">IPC</a> to which he pleaded not guilty

and claimed trial.
</p>

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                2</span>
 relevant time and has proved the computerised copy of FIR as

Ex.PW1/A and copy of DD No.3-B as Ex.PW1/B. PW2 is Ct.

Bhupender who joined the investigation of this case alongwith

the IO SI Sanwar Mal and Ct. Ram Niwas. He has stated that on

13.8.2006, on receipt of DD no.33, he alongwith SI Sanwar Mal

and Ct. Ram Niwas went to JPN Hospital where injured Liyakat

was found admitted and was in operation theatre. He has further

stated that the duty nurse of Surgery Emergency Ward handed

over a sealed parcel containing the blood stain cloth of injured

which was taken into possession by the IO vide memo

Ex.PW2/A. As the injured was unfit for statement, he was left

at the hospital and the IO alongwith Ct. Ram Niwas went to the

spot. He has further stated that again the IO alongwith Ct. Ram

Niwas came to the hospital and at that time also, the injured was

lying unconscious at the hospital and was shown by him to the

IO.
</p>
<p id="p_5">5.         PW-3 Sh. Liyakat Ali, the injured has stated that on

the intervening night of 12/13.8.2006 at about 12.00 (midnight),

he was standing alongwith his rickshaw near public toilet at

Parda Bagh. He has further stated that somebody hit him with a

knife on his stomach and he sustained injuries. Some other

rickshaw puller took him to LNJP Hospital where police

recorded his statement. As this witness has not supported the



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                3</span>
 case of the prosecution, he was cross examined by Ld. Addl. PP

for the State.   During cross examination, PW-3 has denied

having made statement before the police to the effect that on the

intervening night of 12/13.8.2006, accused Babboo was sitting

by the side of wall of Parda Bagh on a wooden patta and he

asked accused Babboo about his wife Gulshan who was living

with the accused on which Babboo told that he had married with

his (complainant) wife in Court. PW-3 has further denied having

stated before the police that when he again asked the accused to

send back his wife, accused started abusing him and grappling

with him and that he slapped the accused on which he brought a

'chhura' and stabbed on his stomach and when accused again

tried to stab him, he rushed towards iron bridge and reached near

a rehri of a Tea Vendor and on his asking, he told the tea vendor

that he was stabbed by Babboo. PW-3 has also denied that

accused Mahender, present in the court, stabbed him on his

stomach with a 'chhura'.
</p>
<p id="p_6">6.         PW-4 is Sh. Hari Ram who took the injured to LNJP

Hospital. This witness has also not supported the case of the

prosecution and during cross examination by Ld. Addl. PP, he

has denied having stated before the police that on his asking Sh.

Liyakat Ali, the injured (PW-3) told him that he was stabbed on

his stomach by Safai Karamchari Babboo whom he also knew



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                4</span>
 previously. PW-4 has also denied that Sh. Liyakat Ali has told

him the name of the accused Mahender as assailant.

</p><p id="p_7">7.          As the injured as well as the public witness have not

supported the case of prosecution, no useful purpose would be

served by examining the IO and other police officials, hence PE

was closed by order of the Court. As nothing incriminating has

come on record which could be put to the accused, the statement

under Sec. 313 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_5">CrPC</a> was also dispensed with.
</p>
<p id="p_8">8.          As the injured Sh. Liyakat Ali (PW-3) and public

witness Sh. Hari Ram (PW-4) have       not   deposed    anything

incriminating against the accused and had not identified the

accused to be the same person who caused injuries to Sh. Liyakat

Ali, accused is acquitted of the charge. His bail bonds stand

discharged. File be consigned to Record Room.

Announced in the open Court.
