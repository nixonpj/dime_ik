</pre><p id="p_4">            In view of the nature of order which we propose to pass, it is

not necessary to seek any counter-reply from the respondents at this stage.

</p><p id="p_5">            The petitioners are residents of village Lehal, Tehsil and

District Gurdaspur. Their land, as described in para No.2 of the writ

petition, has been acquired by respondent No.1 under the <a href="/doc/1222415/" id="a_1">National

Highways Act</a>, 1956, for widening/four-laning, maintenance, management

and operation for National Highway No.15.
</p>
<p id="p_6">            The Award was passed in the year 2009 by the Land

Acquisition Collector/Competent Authority.

</p><p id="p_7">            The petitioner's main grievance is that while assessing the

compensation, the benefits of <a href="/doc/31609/" id="a_2">Sections 23</a> and <a href="/doc/1945807/" id="a_3">28</a> and <a href="/doc/779745/" id="a_4">34</a> of the Land

Acquisition Act, 1894 (hereinafter referred to as '1894 Act'), namely,

solatium and interest have not been granted to him despite the fact that this

Court in M/s Golden Iron and Steel Forgings versus Union of India and

others, 2011 (4) RCR (Civil) 375, has categorically held that in the case of

acquisition under the <a href="/doc/1222415/" id="a_5">National Highways Act</a>, 1956 also, these two statutory

benefits are equally admissible to the affected land-owners. The petitioner

also relies upon the decisions of this Court, dated 27.9.2012 passed in CWP

No.7457 of 2012 (Bhag Singh and another versus Commissioner, Jalandhar

Division and others) and dated 27.9.2012 in CWP No.14642 of 2012 (Prem

Kaur versus Union of India and others), whereby the benefits of solatium

and interest in terms of the above-cited decision, were extended to similarly

situated land-owners.
</p>
<p id="p_8">            The petitioner, besides submitting the applications etc., has

been running from pillar to post for the release of above-mentioned benefits

but the same are said to have been withheld on the plea that there are no

such directions given by this Court in his favour.

</p><p id="p_9">            We have heard learned counsel for the parties at some length

and gone through the record.
</p>
<p id="p_10">            The principles laid down by this Court in Golden Iron and Steel

Forgings's case (supra), are undisputable. The fact that the benefit of

solatium and interest has been extended to other similarly situated land-

owners vide order dated 27.09.2012 in Bhag Singh's case (supra), can be

hardly denied. In these circumstances, it appears imperative upon

respondent Nos.3 &amp; 4 to consider the petitioner's claim for the grant of

solatium and interest in accordance with the decision of this Court in

Golden Iron and Steel Forgings's case (supra).
