<p id="p_1">          This appeal is directed against the judgment of the

learned   Single    Judge    dated        01.06.2016     upholding     the

appointment of respondent No.6 as Lambardar.

</p><p id="p_2">          The appellant questions this mainly on two grounds

which were agitated before the learned Single Judge as has also

been done before us i.e. that respondent No.6 is unlikely to be

available to the villagers as he is engaged in the business of

selling mobiles and secondly he does not belong to the Patti to

which the deceased Lambardar belonged.
</p>
<p id="p_3">          It is argued before us that assuming all factors to be

equal, the factum of the appellant belonging to the same Patti as

the deceased Lambardar would be a factor to outweigh the claim

of respondent No.6.

             We have heard the learned counsel for the appellant

and are of the opinion that the learned Single Judge has

committed no error in law by upholding the choice of the

Collector which ordinarily should have been done unless some

perversity has been shown. We do not find this to be a case where

the appellant is possessed of some exceptional merit than the

selected candidate. There is nothing on record to suggest that

respondent No.6 would not be available to the villagers to serve

them and similarly the issue of belonging to a particular Patti

would be inconsequential in view of the fact that the

advertisement for the post of Lambardar was for the entire village

and not restricted to a particular Patti. We thus agree with the

findings of the learned Single Judge and finding the appeal to be

without any merit decline interference.
</p>
<p id="p_6">             However, we would condone the marginal delay of 5

days in filing the appeal in the interest of justice.
