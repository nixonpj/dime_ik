Order On: 18.09.2017
The Court:

      There is a checkered history of the instant case. The

Petitioner is challenging the action of the Kolkata Municipal

Corporation fixing the compensation amount for the land acquired

for widening the public road and ascertaining the area of land

actually taken for such purposes. The facts, which emanate from

the Writ Petition, are adumbrated hereinbelow.

      The Petitioners are the co-sharers of Premises No. 20, Seven

Tanks Lane, Kolkata - 700 030. The Kolkata Municipal Corporation

acquired a considerable portion of a land from the said premises in
 the year 1996 / 97. Subsequently, the Petitioners along with the

other co-owners, who are Respondent Nos. 6, 7, 8 herein requested</pre>

<p id="p_1">the Corporation to disclose the area of plot of land and also to pay

compensation amount. The Corporation responded to the said

query and asked the owners of the said premises to submit relevant

documents relating the title of the said premises. It was further

indicated therein that the said premises was acquired for the

purpose of widening of the road, which is for public benefits.

</p><p id="p_2">      The Petitioners stated that they would produce all the

relevant documents touching the title of the said property and

further requested the Commissioner of the Corporation to provide

the details of the acquisition and payment of compensation. The

Mayor-in-Council vide letter dated 19.07.1999 addressed to the

owner of the said premises, replied that the matter relating to

payment of compensation by the Corporation is under process and

expected to be completed within a month. There was a complete

silence from the end of the Petitioner for nearly 8 to 10 months

until a letter was caused on 31st May, 2000 reiterating the earlier

stand and demanding the details of the area acquired by the

Corporation   for   widening   the   road   and   the   quantum   of

compensation.
</p><p id="p_3">      By a letter of the even date, the Corporation informed the

Petitioner that as per the decision of the Mayor-in-Council in a

meeting held on 30th September, 1998, the compensation has been

fixed at Rs. 40,000/- per kathas and the total area which had been

acquired by the Corporation is 18,695.52 sq. ft. The Petitioner

immediately raised objection not only to the area, which the

Corporation claimed to have acquired but also the rate, which was

fixed for payment of compensation. In the letter dated 12.06.2000,

the Petitioner indicated that the area of acquisition is 22,484 sq. ft.

and not 18,695.52 sq. ft. as disclosed by the Corporation. The

Petitioner further wanted the joint inspection to ascertain the

actual area acquired by the Corporation.
</p>
<p id="p_4">
</p><p id="p_5">     Since, the Corporation showed reluctance in conducting the

joint survey / inspection to ascertain the actual area acquired by

the Corporation, the predecessor of the present Petitioners filed a

Writ Petitioner being W.P. No. 81245(W) of 2002 before this Court.

The said Writ Petition appeared on 16.07.2002 and was disposed of

upon recording the submission made by the learned Advocate

representing the Corporation that the decision had already taken

for payment of compensation, which would be conveyed to the

Petitioners therein and the payment will be made within a month.
 The Court disposed of the said Writ Petition on the said date as the

Writ Petition becomes infractuous in view of the aforesaid

submission and the liberty was granted to the Petitioner to

challenge such decision if felt dissatisfied with the amount of

compensation before the appropriate forum.
</p>
<p id="p_6">
</p><p id="p_7">     The Corporation cause another letter dated 01.08.2002 and

forwarded a draft sale deed for approval to the predecessor of the

petitioners in terms of the order passed by this Court in the said

Writ Petition. A further letter dated 17.09.2002 was issued by the

Chief Valuer and Surveyor of the Corporation informing the then

owners that the cheque is ready for payment but till date the draft

sale deed and the site plan have not been approved for its

execution and registration.
</p>
<p id="p_8">     The   Petitioner   issued   further   letter   dated   12.11.2002

indicating the discrepancies in the site plan and area actually

acquired by the Corporation for widening of the said road and

curiously enough took an exception to the draft sale deed, which

according to the Petitioner, was not in tune with of the order

passed in the said Writ Petition. The sum and substance of the said

letter is that the Court did not pass any direction for execution of

the said deed but an agreement has to be entered into in this
 regard and the Corporation had not paid the ascertained amount of

compensation within the specified date as indicated in the said

order. Another Writ Petition being W.P. No. 11300(W) of 2003 was

filed before this Court challenging the purported action of the

Corporation in demanding the documents relating to title being

contrary to the spirit of the order passed in the earlier Writ Petition

and also non-payment of the compensation money.
</p>
<p id="p_9">       The second Writ Petition came up for disposal on 01.04.2005

and in the first paragraph of the said order, it was specifically

recorded that the Corporation has acquired some land belonging to

the Petitioner for the purpose of construction of road and a copy of

the sale deed was also served upon the Petitioners therein. The

Court further observed:-
</p>
<p id="p_10">        "Since the land was already acquired by the Corporation without any agreement
with the petitioner, acceptance of the amount by signing the agreement will disentitle the
petitioner from challenging the quantum of compensation. Section 537 of the said Act
makes it clear that in the event there is no agreement between the parties each procedure
is required to be adopted for the purpose of acquisition of land in question and there is no
procedure laid down for payment of compensation.
</p><p id="p_11">        In the circumstances, I make it clear that accepting the condition contained in the
agreement will not disentitle the petitioner to challenge the quantum of compensation that
has been fixed by the agreement in the instant case. The respondent authorities shall
make over the amount of compensation which has already been fixed by him upon
execution of the agreement which was been forwarded to the petitioner. The respondent
authorities shall also complete the execution of agreement within a period of four weeks
from the date of communication of this order."
</p>
<p id="p_12">       Pursuant to the said order, the Corporation asked the draft

sale deed, which was earlier sent to the Petitioner, to be returned

after approval so that the Corporation can proceed in terms of the
 order passed in the second Writ Petition. The Petitioner replied the

said letter and took a strange defense that the tenet of the order

would reveal that the Court wanted the agreement to be executed

and not the sale deed and demanded the draft copy of the

agreement so that the further steps can be taken. There was a

further insistence on the part of the Petitioners for joint inspection

and a series of correspondences between the parties would

corroborate that subsequently the Corporation handed over the

draft copy of the agreement for sale and the consideration to be

paid for such acquisition. The Petitioner reiterated and maintained

their objection on the quantum of the land acquired by the

Corporation and insistence can be seen therefrom over the joint

inspection and / or survey.
</p>
<p id="p_13">     Mr. S.N. Mukherjee, learned Senior Advocate, appearing for

the Petitioner submits that the purported action of the Corporation

in acquiring the land is contrary to the provisions contained in

Section 537 of the said Act. He ardently submitted that though

there is an apparent need of acquisition for public purposes but the

Corporation being the Statutory Authority cannot act contrary to

the provisions of the Act. According to Mr. Mukherjee, even if the

observation is recorded in the order passed in the Writ Petition that
 the property has been acquired, it does not cure the inherent

defects in the manner of acquisition being violative of the express

provisions contained in Section 537(1) of the Kolkata Municipal

Corporation Act, 1980. To buttress the aforesaid submission, the

reliance is placed upon a judgment of the Supreme Court in case of

Neeraj Munjal &amp; Ors. -Vs- Atul Grover &amp; Anr. reported in AIR

2005 SC 2867 wherein it is held that the principle of resjudicata

cannot apply if the earlier declaration by the Court is contrary to

the existing law.
</p>
<p id="p_14">     Mr. Mukherjee further argues that the manner in which the

land is acquired by the State or the Statutory Authorities if

ultimately found to be violative of the provisions of the Act, it does

not necessarily invite the reversion of possession to the owners but

compensation is required to be determined after de novo initiation

of the acquisition proceeding and relies upon a judgment of the

Supreme Court in case of Laxmi Devi -Vs- State of Bihar &amp; Ors.

reported in (2015) 10 SCC 241 and Soorajmull Nagarmull -Vs-

State of Bihar &amp; Ors. reported in the same volume at page 270.

</p><p id="p_15">     Mr. Mukherjee vehemently submits that though the power of

eminent domain is inherent to every sovereign but is circumscribed

by the authority of law and placed reliance upon a judgment of the
 Apex Court in case of Readhy Shyam (Dead) Through LRs. &amp; Ors

</p><p id="p_16">-Vs- State of Uttar Pradesh &amp; Ors. reported in (2011) 5 SCC

</p><p id="p_17">553.

       According to Mr. Mukherjee, even if the public purpose is

laudable and the manner and procedure adopted for acquisition is

contrary to the provisions of the Statute, the State has to proceed

de novo and fix the compensation if the property had already been

expropriated by the State or the Statutory Authorities.

</p><p id="p_18">       On the other hand, Mr. Ashok Kumar Banerjee, learned

Senior Counsel, appearing for the Corporation submits that the

Petitioner cannot impinge the manner and the procedure adopted

by the Corporation to acquire the land of the Petitioner in view of

categorical observations and findings recorded in the second Writ

Petition filed by the owners of the said property. Mr. Banerjee

would contend that the only point which needs to be decided is

whether the quantum of compensation determined by the authority

is proper or not as the right was reserved upon the said owners to

challenge the same. Mr. Banerjee further submits that the Court

while interpreting the orders must find out the essence and

avoidance should be the rule to interpret the same as a Statute and

placed reliance upon the judgment of the Supreme Court in case of
 State of Rajasthan -Vs- Ganeshi Lal reported in AIR 2008 SC

</p><p id="p_19">690.

       By placing reliance upon another judgment of the Supreme

Court in case of Sooraram Pratap Reddy -Vs- District Collector,

Ranga Reddy District &amp; Ors. Reported in (2008) 9 SCC 552 Mr.

Banerjee would contend that every State enjoins the right of power

of eminent domain to take the individuals property for public use

without the owner's consent and the only remedy available to such

owners is to claim just and proper compensation. It is, thus,

submitted that large number of properties were acquired for

widening the road and the owners of the other properties except the

Petitioners herein accepted the compensation.
</p>
<p id="p_20">       Mr. Banerjee would further contend that the owners never

challenged the mode of acquisition in earlier two Writ Petitions filed

before this Court neither the mode of acquisition in the instant Writ

Petition as the reliefs claimed therein is restricted to the quantum

of compensation and the ascertainment of the area of land actually

acquired for widening the road. He, thus says that the challenge to

the mode and procedure for acquisition is taken for the first time at

the bar and in view of the express orders passed in the erstwhile

Writ Petitions, the Petitioners are estopped from contending so. He
 further submits that in a meeting of the Mayor-in-Council, the

compensation     amount     was    enhanced,    which    was    duly

communicated to the Petitioner as the same was found to be just,

reasonable and proper. Lastly, it is submitted that the instant Writ

Petition should be dismissed with exemplary cost.
</p>
<p id="p_21">     It would be no gain saying that no relief is claimed by

challenging the mode of the acquisition adopted by the Corporation

way back in the year 1997-98. Though it is submitted by Mr.

Mukherjee, appearing for the Petitioners that the Corporation must

take recourse to sub-Section 1 of Section 537 of the Act in the

event of failure to acquire the property by agreement but it is

evident and apparent that the Petitioner had, in fact, accepted the

acquisition and was all along dissatisfied over the quantum of

compensation to be paid. The Court should not venture to decide

the point urged for the first time at the bar without any foundation

in the pleading and specific relief claimed thereupon. Apart from

the same, the first Writ Petition filed by the owners was simply

disposed of on the submission advanced by the Corporation at that

point of time that they are contemplating to fix the compensation

which would be paid within the time frame. The Petitioner did not

challenge the said order and therefore the same attained finality.
</p><p id="p_22">      Even thereafter a draft sale deed was forwarded to the

Petitioner   and   in   the   communication   exchanged   with   the

Corporation, it does not appear that there was any whisper on the

mode of acquisition but the dispute all along hinged upon the

quantum of compensation and the area of land acquired by the

Corporation.
</p>
<p id="p_23">     In the second Writ Petition, the Court categorically observed

that the land had been acquired and an opportunity was granted in

the first Writ Petition to challenge the quantum of compensation to

be paid to the owners. Though Section 537 of the said Act was

recorded in the second Writ Petition but the same cannot be

construed that the Court opened the mode of acquisition by the

Corporation conferring right upon the Petitioner to challenge the

same. The harmonious reading of the findings recorded in the

second Writ Petition and the ultimate decision taken therein clearly

envisage that the Corporation should determine the compensation

following the provisions contained under the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_1">Land Acquisition Act</a>.

</p><p id="p_24">     Mr. Mukherjee is right in his submission that there is a clear

distinction between a right to acquire a property and the mode and

the manner of such acquisition. <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_2">Section 352</a> of the Act confers

power upon the Corporation to acquire the property for the purpose
 of public streets or widening of the streets but the mode of

acquisition is provided under <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_3">Section 536</a> of the said Act. The said

Section empowers the Corporation to acquire the property by

agreement upon payment of consideration as may be fixed by the

Mayor-in-Council. It is evident and apparent from sub-Section 1 of

Section 537 of the Act that in the event the Corporation is unable

to acquire the property by agreement, the approach should be

made to the State to exercise the power of eminent domain by

acquiring the said property under the provisions of the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_4">Land

Acquisition Act</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_25">     It would not be wrong to say that the Corporation does not

enjoin the power to acquire the property by agreement. At this

juncture,   when   several   orders   have   been   passed   and   the

acquisition has been duly recognized, it is too late in a day to set

aside the decision of the order of acquisition merely on the basis of

submissions made at the bar. The Petitioner accepted those orders

and even in the instant Writ Petition has not specifically claimed

any relief in this regard. It is no longer res integra that the plea of

resjudicata is based upon the public policy. Finality to the litigation

is the rule and no person should be allowed to agitate the similar

and identical issues in the subsequent proceeding, if the same was
 directly and substantially an issue in an earlier proceeding or

might have been an issue capable to be raised therein and having

not raised, shall be deemed to have been decided. The said rule is

not free from exception and one of the exceptions has been

indicated in case of Neeraj Munjal (Supra) wherein it is held that

where the earlier declaration by the Court is established to be

contrary to an existing law.
</p>
<p id="p_26">     This Court does not find that the decision can be of any

assistance to the Petitioner for the simple reason that right to

challenge the mode of acquisition was available to the owners when

the first Writ Petition was filed and even may presumably be

available in the second Writ Petition. If a person has consciously

abandoned his right to challenge the order or the mode of

acquisition and acted upon the orders where the liberty was

granted to challenge the compensation, it is not upon to the

Petitioners to reopen an issue, which has been set at rest.

</p><p id="p_27">     Equally, this Court does not find that the judgment rendered

in case of Radhy Shyam (Supra) is in effect a pointer to the issue

involved in the instant case. In the said report the challenge was

made to an acquisition of the land by the State upon receipt of a

proposal from a Greater Noida Industrial Development Authority for
 planned industrial Development in Goutam Budh Nagar District.

The notification under <a href="/doc/169774/" id="a_5">Section 4(1)</a> of the Land Acquisition Act,

1894 read with <a href="/doc/423817/" id="a_6">Section 17(1)</a> and (4) of the said Act was issued.

The appellants therein challenged the said acquisition on the

grounds which are succinctly recorded in paragraph 4 of the said

report and runs thus:-
</p>
<p id="p_28">        "4. The appellants challenged the acquisition of their land on several grounds
including the following:
</p><p id="p_29">        (i) That the land cannot be used for industrial purposes because in the draft
Master Plan of Greater Noida (2021), the same is shown as part of the residential zone.
</p><p id="p_30">        (ii) That they had already constructed dwelling houses and as per the policy of the
State Government, the residential structures are exempted from acquisition.
</p><p id="p_31">        (iii) That the State Government arbitrarily invoked <a href="/doc/423817/" id="a_7">Section 17(1)</a> read with <a href="/doc/68773460/" id="a_8">Section
17(4)</a> of the Act and deprived them of their valuable right to raise objections under <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_9">Section
5-A</a>.
</p><p id="p_32">        (iv) The acquisition of land is vitiated by arbitrariness, mala fides and violation of
<a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_10">Article 14</a> of the Constitution inasmuch as lands of the Member of Legislative Assembly
and other influential persons were left out from acquisition despite the fact that they were
not in abadi, but they were not given similar treatment despite the fact that their land
was part of abadi and they had constructed dwelling units."



</p><p id="p_33">       One of the arguments which was advanced before the

Supreme Court was that the purpose of such acquisition i.e. the

planned industrial development of the District, does not justify

invoking of urgency provisions by denying an opportunity to the

land owners to file objection under <a href="/doc/1229923/" id="a_11">Section 5A(1)</a> and an

opportunity of hearing under sub-<a href="/doc/331372/" id="a_12">Section 2</a> thereof. The Apex

Court, after elaborately considering the eminent domain of the

sovereign / State and the different provisions of the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_13">Land

Acquisition Act</a> summarized the proposition of law as under:-
</p><p id="p_34">         "77. From the analysis of the relevant statutory provisions and interpretation
thereof by this Court in different cases, the following principles can be culled out:
</p><p id="p_35">        (i) Eminent domain is a right inherent in every sovereign to take and appropriate
property belonging to citizens for public use. To put it differently, the sovereign is entitled
to reassert its dominion over any portion of the soil of the State including private property
without its owner's consent provided that such assertion is on account of public exigency
and for public good -- <a href="/doc/1880952/" id="a_14">Dwarkadas Shrinivas v. Sholapur Spg. and Wvg. Co. Ltd</a>. [AIR

</p><p id="p_36">       (ii) The legislations which provide for compulsory acquisition of private property by
the State fall in the category of expropriatory legislation and such legislation must be
construed strictly -- <a href="/doc/1119469/" id="a_17">DLF Qutab Enclave Complex Educational Charitable Trust v. State of
Haryana</a> [(2003) 5 SCC 622] ; <a href="/doc/1074081/" id="a_18">State of Maharashtra v. B.E. Billimoria</a> [(2003) 7 SCC 336]

</p><p id="p_37">        (iii) Though, in exercise of the power of eminent domain, the Government can
acquire the private property for public purpose, it must be remembered that compulsory
taking of one's property is a serious matter. If the property belongs to economically
disadvantaged segment of the society or people suffering from other handicaps, then the
court is not only entitled but is duty-bound to scrutinise the action/decision of the State
with greater vigilance, care and circumspection keeping in view the fact that the
landowner is likely to become landless and deprived of the only source of his livelihood
and/or shelter.
</p><p id="p_38">        (iv) The property of a citizen cannot be acquired by the State and/or its
agencies/instrumentalities without complying with the mandate of <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_20">Sections 4</a>, <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_21">5-A</a> and <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_22">6</a>
of the Act. A public purpose, however laudable it may be does not entitle the State to
invoke the urgency provisions because the same have the effect of depriving the owner of
his right to property without being heard. Only in a case of real urgency, can the State
invoke the urgency provisions and dispense with the requirement of hearing the
landowner or other interested persons.
</p>
<p id="p_39">        (v) <a href="/doc/423817/" id="a_23">Section 17(1)</a> read with <a href="/doc/68773460/" id="a_24">Section 17(4)</a> confers extraordinary power upon the
State to acquire private property without complying with the mandate of <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_25">Section 5-A</a>.
These provisions can be invoked only when the purpose of acquisition cannot brook the
delay of even a few weeks or months. Therefore, before excluding the application of
<a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_26">Section 5-A</a>, the authority concerned must be fully satisfied that time of few weeks or
months likely to be taken in conducting inquiry under <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_27">Section 5-A</a> will, in all probability,
frustrate the public purpose for which land is proposed to be acquired.
</p><p id="p_40">        (vi) The satisfaction of the Government on the issue of urgency is subjective but is
a condition precedent to the exercise of power under <a href="/doc/423817/" id="a_28">Section 17(1)</a> and the same can be
challenged on the ground that the purpose for which the private property is sought to be
acquired is not a public purpose at all or that the exercise of power is vitiated due to mala
fides or that the authorities concerned did not apply their mind to the relevant factors and
the records.
</p><p id="p_41">        (vii) The exercise of power by the Government under <a href="/doc/423817/" id="a_29">Section 17(1)</a> does not
necessarily result in exclusion of <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_30">Section 5-A</a> of the Act in terms of which any person
interested in land can file objection and is entitled to be heard in support of his objection.
The use of word "may" in sub-section (4) of <a href="/doc/1797812/" id="a_31">Section 17</a> makes it clear that it merely
enables the Government to direct that the provisions of <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_32">Section 5-A</a> would not apply to the
cases covered under sub-section (1) or (2) of <a href="/doc/1797812/" id="a_33">Section 17</a>. In other words, invoking of
<a href="/doc/68773460/" id="a_34">Section 17(4)</a> is not a necessary concomitant of the exercise of power under <a href="/doc/423817/" id="a_35">Section 17(1)</a>.
</p><p id="p_42">        (viii) The acquisition of land for residential, commercial, industrial or institutional
purposes can be treated as an acquisition for public purposes within the meaning of
<a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_36">Section 4</a> but that, by itself, does not justify the exercise of power by the Government
under <a href="/doc/423817/" id="a_37">Sections 17(1)</a> and/or 17(4). The court can take judicial notice of the fact that
planning, execution and implementation of the schemes relating to development of
residential, commercial, industrial or institutional areas usually take few years.
Therefore, the private property cannot be acquired for such purpose by invoking the
urgency provision contained in <a href="/doc/423817/" id="a_38">Section 17(1)</a>. In any case, exclusion of the rule of audi
alteram partem embodied in <a href="/doc/1229923/" id="a_39">Sections 5-A(1)</a> and (2) is not at all warranted in such
matters.
</p><p id="p_43">       (ix) If land is acquired for the benefit of private persons, the court should view the
invoking of <a href="/doc/423817/" id="a_40">Sections 17(1)</a> and/or 17(4) with suspicion and carefully scrutinise the
relevant record before adjudicating upon the legality of such acquisition."


</p><p id="p_44">       There cannot be any quarrel to the proposition as laid down

therein but this Court does not find that the same can be of any

help to the Petitioner herein because of the special facts that the

Petitioner has shown his silence since the acquisition and even in

the instant Writ Petition has not put forth any challenge to it.

</p><p id="p_45">       The Laxmi Devi (Supra) and Soorajmull Nagarmull (Supra)

are the decisions relatable to the mode of acquisition being the

subject matter therein. However, in case of Soorajmull Nagarmull

(Supra), the Apex Court noticed the provision of <a href="/doc/1767825/" id="a_41">Section 24</a> of the

Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition,

Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013 to have its applicability

if the contingencies recorded in the said Section applies.                           In my

opinion, <a href="/doc/1485112/" id="a_42">Section 24</a> of the 2013 Act should not be resorted to as the

acquisition is not made under the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_43">Land Acquisition Act</a> nor the

conditions enshrined therein are satisfied.
</p><p id="p_46">      The order dated 16.07.2002 passed in W.P. No. 8125 of 2002

would reveal that an opportunity was granted to the Petitioner to

challenge the fixation of compensation before the appropriate

forum. In the opening sentence of the order dated 01.04.2005

passed in W.P. 11300(W) of 2002, succinctly records that the

challenge made in the first Writ Petition and the subsequent

findings recorded therein leaves no ambiguity that the acquisition

by the Corporation was accepted by the Petitioner and the scope of

challenge was limited to the quantum of compensation. The Court

was conscious of the provision of <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_44">Section 537</a> of the Act while

observing that the said provision is applicable in the event, there is

no agreement between the parties and there is no procedure laid

down therein for determining the quantum of compensation.

Ultimately, it was ordered that the acceptance of the condition

contained in the agreement shall not disentitle the Petitioner to

challenge the quantum of compensation, which is fixed by the

agreement meaning thereby it was open to the Petitioner to

challenge only the quantum of compensation and not the act of

acquisition. In fact, the Petitioner accepted the aforesaid position

and all along raised an objection to the quantum of compensation

fixed by the Corporation. It is no longer res integra that the order of
 the Court should not be read as s Statute nor what would logically

flows from the observations made in the judgment. The observation

of the Apex Court in case of Ganeshi Lal (Supra) can be seen in the

above perspective wherein it is held:-
</p>
<p id="p_47">        "11. "12. ... Reliance on the decision without looking into the factual background
of the case before it, is clearly impermissible. A decision is a precedent on its own facts.
Each case presents its own features. It is not everything said by a Judge while giving
judgment that constitutes a precedent. The only thing in a Judge's decision binding a
party is the principle upon which the case is decided and for this reason it is important to
analyse a decision and isolate from it the ratio decidendi. According to the well-settled
theory of precedents, every decision contains three basic postulates: (i) findings of
material facts, direct and inferential. An inferential finding of facts is the inference which
the Judge draws from the direct, or perceptible facts; (ii) statements of the principles of
law applicable to the legal problems disclosed by the facts; and (iii) judgment based on
the combined effect of the above. A decision is an authority for what it actually decides.
What is of the essence in a decision is its ratio and not every observation found therein
nor what logically flows from the various observations made in the judgment. The
enunciation of the reason or principle on which a question before a court has been
decided is alone binding as a precedent. (<a href="/doc/1656601/" id="a_45">See State of Orissa v. Sudhansu Sekhar Misra</a>
[AIR 1968 SC 647] and <a href="/doc/35277720/" id="a_46">Union of India v. Dhanwanti Devi</a> [(1996) 6 SCC 44] .) A case is a
precedent and binding for what it explicitly decides and no more. The words used by
Judges in their judgments are not to be read as if they are words in an Act of Parliament.
In Quinn v. Leathem [1901 AC 495 : (1900-1903) All ER Rep 1 (HL)] Earl of Halsbury, L.C.
observed that every judgment must be read as applicable to the particular facts proved or
assumed to be proved, since the generality of the expressions which are found there are
not intended to be the exposition of the whole law but governed and qualified by the
particular facts of the case in which such expressions are found and a case is only an
authority for what it actually decides." [Ed.: <a href="/doc/1613962/" id="a_47">See State of Orissa v. Mohd. Illiyas</a>, (2006) 1
SCC 275 at p. 282, para 12.]"
</p>
<p id="p_48">       The Apex Court in case of Sooraram Pratap Reddy (Supra)

elaborated the concept of eminent domain and its advancement

from time to time and it would be apt to quote the observations

recorded in paragraphs 63 and 65 of the said report which runs

thus:-
</p>
<p id="p_49">       "63. In Coffee Board v. CCT [(1988) 3 SCC 263 : 1988 SCC (Tax) 308] referring to
American authorities, Mukharji, J. (as His Lordship then was) stated: (SCC p. 282, para
</p><p id="p_50">29)
       "29. ... It is trite knowledge that eminent domain is an essential attribute of
sovereignty of every State and authorities are universal in support of the definition of
 eminent domain as the power of the sovereign to take property for public use without the
owner's consent upon making just compensation."
</p><p id="p_51">       65. <a href="/doc/342860/" id="a_48">In Sharda Devi v. State of Bihar</a> [(2003) 3 SCC 128] this Court said: (SCC p.
144, para 27)
        "27 ... The power to acquire by the State the land owned by its subjects hails from
the right of eminent domain vesting in the State which is essentially an attribute of
sovereign power of the State. So long as the public purpose subsists, the exercise of the
power by the State to acquire the land of its subjects without regard to the wishes or
willingness of the owner or person interested in the land cannot be questioned."

</p><p id="p_52">        In view of the peculiar facts involved in the instant case, it is

axiomatic to record that the Corporation must adopt the fair,

reasonable and just compensation in determining the market value

prevalent at the time of its acquisition and not in a whimsical and

arbitrary manner as has been done in the instant case. The

Petitioners should be allowed to produce the relevant documents

touching the market value prevalent at the time of the acquisition

and thereafter the Mayor-in-Council, who is otherwise competent to

determine the price under sub-Section 2 of Section 536 should fix

the same.
</p>
<p id="p_53">        There also appears to be a serious dispute on the quantum of

land actually acquired for such public purpose and therefore, this

Court feels it necessary that a joint inspection should be held by

the Senior Officers of the Corporation and the representative of the

Petitioner to find out the extent of land acquired for widening the

road.
</p><p id="p_54">      The aforesaid inspection should be done within 8 (eight)

weeks from the date of the communication of this order.

</p><p id="p_55">     Thereafter, the compensation so determined by the Mayor-in-

Council should be reflected in the said agreement and all endeavor

shall be made to execute the same within 4 (four) weeks from the

date of such joint inspection.
</p>
<p id="p_56">     The Writ Petition is, thus, disposed of.
</p>
<p id="p_57">     However, there shall be no order as to costs.
</p>
<p id="p_58">     Urgent photostat certified copy of this order shall be given to

the parties within three days from the date of the application.



</p><p id="p_59">                                                (Harish Tandon, J.)
