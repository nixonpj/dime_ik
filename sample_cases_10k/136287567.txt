                                          ORAL JUDGMENT</pre>


<p id="p_1">         1.     Aggrieved from the judgment and award dated
         1.12.1987        passed          by     the         Motor        Accident            Claims
         Tribunal (Main), Mehsana in MAC Petition No. 200
         of     1983,      wherein,             against           the       claim          of       Rs.
         70,000/-, the Tribunal has awarded Rs. 30,540/-
         to the appellant.
</p>

<p id="p_2">         2.     The facts of this case are that an accident
         has taken place on 11.6.1981 at about 10.00a.m.,
         when    the      claimant            was      moving         in      the       truck            of
         opponent no. 4 on Radhanpur - Viramgam highway
         and they were moving towards Viramgam.                                            At that
         time, driver of the truck was driving the truck
         on the left side of the road. When the truck
         reached       near        Panchasar            village,            at      that        time,
         from the otherside, ST bus No. GRS- 8511 came at
         full speed, and all of sudden, both, truck and
         bus dashed with each other. As a result of this
         accident,                the         appellant-claimant                         received
         injuries including fracture of his left leg.
</p>

<p id="p_3">         3.     In claim petition, the Tribunal has assessed
         the    income        of        the    appellant             at     Rs.       450/-         per
         month.      Keeping             in     view           the      disability,                 the
         Tribunal         awarded             the           aforementioned                  amount.
         Aggrieved          from         this          decision,              the        original
         claimant            has         come       in       appeal.           It      would             be
         necessary to point out that the appellant has
         claimed        Rs.        70,000/-            in       the       original              claim
         petition before the Tribunal, however, later on,

                    C/FA/801/2006                                                      JUDGMENT




         in this appeal, the appellant has restricted his
         prayer for enhancement of Rs. 15,000/-.
</p>

<p id="p_4">         4.   Learned              counsel           for           the         appellant                has
         submitted          that         the    Tribunal                has       erred         in      not
         awarding Rs. 6000/- towards medical treatment and
         has only awarded Rs. 1500/-. Rs. 2000/- towards
         transportation              charge          was        also         required             to         be
         awarded.        Similarly,              the         disability               should          have
         been assessed at least 50% as the claimant was
         deprived from doing job which he was doing before
         the accident. At the time of accident, claimant
         was 31 years of age, and hence, multiplier of 17
         should       have         been        applied             in      place         of       14         as
         applied        by         the     Tribunal.                 Relying             upon         this
         submission, learned counsel for the appellant has
         requested          for      enhancement                   of     the        compensation
         amount.
</p>

<p id="p_5">         5.   On       the         other        hand,           learned             counsel             for
         Insurance Company of the truck as well as ST Bus,
         have submitted that the income assessed by the
         Tribunal at the rate of Rs. 450/- per month has
         been rightly assessed by the Tribunal,                                            as at the
         relevant time, the minimum wages were even less
         than Rs. 450/- per month. Similarly, it has been
         argued that Rs. 1500/- awarded towards medicines
         were on the basis of the bills produced by the
         appellant and multiplier of 17 was not applicable
         in   the      year        1981        when          the     accident             has       taken
         place.           Relying              upon                the           aforementioned

         submissions,              both      the           learned         counsels              have
         prayed for dismissal of this appeal.
</p>

<p id="p_6">         6.     The accident between the truck and bus is not
         in dispute. It is also not in dispute that at the
         relevant time, the claimant was travelling in the
         truck and received injuries including fracture.
         Because of this accident, he has been disabled to
         the extent of 22% and he is not able to perform
         the same function which he was performing prior
         to the date of the accident.
</p>

<p id="p_7">         7.     It could be seen that the appellant, at the
         time of accident, was doing job of labour which
         was     a      manual            job.         By         every         stretch                 of
         imagination, he is not able to do the same job
         because of the disability and will have to spend
         rest    of     his        life      with          this     disability.                Under
         these circumstances, the award of Rs. 30,540/- is
         on lesser side which requires to be enhanced.
</p>

<p id="p_8">         8.     Keeping in view the nature of job, nature of
         injury,       extent           of      disability              and         facts          and
         circumstances of this case, the award amount is
         further enhanced in lumpsum to Rs. 20,000/-. The
         enhanced       amount          to    be       paid       to      the       appellant-
         original claimant within a period of six weeks
         from the date of receipt of the copy of this
         order.      The      award        of     the         Tribunal          is      modified
         accordingly              and   present            appeal       stands          disposed
