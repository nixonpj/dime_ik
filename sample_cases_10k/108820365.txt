<p id="p_1">1.             The   brief   facts   of   the   prosecution   case   are   that   on

30.06.2000 on receipt of DD No.17A regarding the incident,  HC Umed

Singh,  IO along  with  Ct. Mahesh  Singh reached at the GTB Hospital

where he obtained MLCs of injured Rushtam S/o Iqram and Pappu S/o

Prem Pal  on which doctor  has opined  the injured "Fit for Statement"

and injuries "U/O Blunt".   IO recorded statement of injured Pappu S/o

Prem Pal to the effect that  on 30.06.2000 he  along with Rustam were

working as  baledaars at the house of Anoop at East Jyoti Nagar, behind

Mother Dairy, Durga Puri, Delhi.  They were raising a wall on 3½ feet

Chajja on the third floor of the house.  Despite the fact that Lanter was

new  and  attention   of  Anoop  Singh,  owner was  drawn  to this  fact, he

allowed   the   construction   work  and  at  about  4.30   p.m.  the   Chajja  fell

down and both the Baledaars sustained multiple injuries on their persons.

This accident had occurred due to negligence of house owner. He and

Rustam have been admitted in GTB Hospital by Rashid and Bhure.  On

this statement  of injured Pappu,  HC Umed Singh, IO prepared rukka on

the   basis   of   which   FIR   No.172/2000   U/s   288/336  <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_3">IPC</a>   was   recorded.

Accused was arrested and after completion of investigation, charge sheet

U/s 288/336/338 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_4">IPC</a> was filed in the court for trial. 

</p><p id="p_2">2.             Accused put his appearance in the court. Copies of challan

were   supplied   to   him.     After   hearing   notice   U/s   251   <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_5">Cr.P.C</a>.   for   the

offence   U/s   288/336/338   <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_6">IPC</a>   was   framed   on   13.03.2003     to   which
                                             3/4                    FIR No.172/2000

accused pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. 
</p>
<p id="p_3">3.             In order to prove its case, prosecution examined as many as

4 witnesses.   PW­2 is HC Bani Singh, Duty Officer who recorded and

proved FIR No.172/2000 copy of which is Ex.P.W.2/A. He is a formal

witness.  
</p>
<p id="p_4">4.             P.W.3 is SAG Mahesh Singh who stated that on 30.06.2010

on  receipt of DD No.17A he along with IO reached at GTB Hospital

where they obtained MLCs of injured persons who were fit for statement.

Statement   of   injured   Pappu  was  recorded  on  which  endorsement  was

made by IO and he was sent to P.S. with rukka on the basis of which FIR

of present case was recorded.  Site plan was prepared and photographs of

the spot were taken.   But accused was not traceable.   He is also a formal

witness. 
</p>
<p id="p_5">5.             P.W.4   is   Dr.   Gurbachan   Singh   who   has   stated   that   he

identifies the handwriting  and signatures of Dr. Purshottam Singh, Sr.

Resident on the MLC of injured Pappu and the MLC is Ex.P.W.4/A.    

</p><p id="p_6">6.             P.W.1 is Jagdev who has stated that on 30.06.2000 his son in

law Anoop and his daughter Rekha were living in a tenanted premises at

C­24,   Durga   Puri   Extension,  Delhi.     He   stated   that   he   could   not   say

whether there was boundary wall on the roof or not as he had not seen

the terrace of the said premises.   He do not know anything else.   This

witness was declared hostile and was cross­examined by learned APP for

State.     But   nothing   material   came   out   in   his   cross­examination.

Thereafter,   the   prosecution   evidence   was   closed   vide   order   dated
                                            4/4                    FIR No.172/2000

07.02.2011   as   P.W.   Rashid   and   injured   Pappu   and   Rustam   were   not

traceable despite last and final opportunity.
</p>
<p id="p_7">7.            I have  heard  learned APP for State and  Sh. M. Bhaduria,

learned counsel for the accused and have perused the record. 

</p><p id="p_8">8.             In this case P.W.1 Jagdev is  the material witness.  But he

did not support the prosecution case at all and turned hostile.   He was

cross­examined by learned APP for State but nothing material came out

in his cross­examination.  Other eye witness Rashid and injured persons

namely   Pappu   and   Rustam   were   reported   to   be   untraceable   despite

various   opportunities   and   last   and   final   opportunity   granted   to   the

prosecution and ultimately prosecution evidence was closed vide order

dated 07.02.2011.  There is nothing incriminating against the accused to

connect him to the commission of offence U/s 288/336/338 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_7">IPC</a>. 

</p><p id="p_9">9.            Hence,   I   have   no   hesitation   to   hold   that   prosecution   has

failed to prove its case against the accused beyond reasonable doubt and

accordingly accused is acquitted of the offence charged with.  Bail bond

and  surety   of  accused  are  treated  as  ones    U/s  437  Cr. P.C.    File  be

consigned to record room.</p><pre id="pre_2">
