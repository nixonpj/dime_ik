And:

The State of Karnataka,
Represented by Nelogi Station,
Nelogi, Tq. Jewargi,
Dist. Kalaburagi
R/By Special Public Prosecutor
                                                         ... Respondent
(By Sri. Prakash Yeli, Addl. S.P.P.)

       This Criminal Petition is filed under <a href="/doc/1783708/" id="a_1">Section 438</a> of
Cr.P.C., praying to enlarge the petitioners on anticipatory
bail in the event of their arrest in Cr.No.81/2017, registered
by the Nelogi P.S., pending on the file of JMFC Court,
Jewargi.

     This petition coming on for Orders this day, the Court
made the following:-

                            ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">       The    present      petition        is        filed      by      the

petitioners/accused Nos.1 and 10 under <a href="/doc/1783708/" id="a_2">Section 438</a> of

Cr.P.C., seeking anticipatory bail in Crime No.81/2017 of

Nelogi P.S., registered for the offences punishable under

<a href="/doc/1119707/" id="a_3">Section 395</a> of Indian Penal Code.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">       2. Brief facts leading to filing of the complaint are

that, on 2.5.2017 at about 7:00 p.m., complainant and

Channamallayya       Hiremath       went        to    attend     funeral

ceremony     of   one   Mallanna       Biredar.         After        leaving
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                              3</span>




Channamallayya Hiremath to his house, complainant

along with two others by name Bhimaraya S/o Shivaraya

Biredar and Dundappa S/o Shivasharanappa Biredar

were proceeding to attend second nature call, at that time,

the accused persons by holding a knife, stick and stones

came there and abused the complainant with filthy

language   and   also   threatened   and,   thereafter    they

snatched one tola gold chain and cash of Rs.4,000/- from

the complainant then they ran away from the spot.

Subsequently, a complaint was came to be registered on

3.5.2017 at 4:00 p.m.


</p><p id="p_4">     3.    I have heard the learned counsel for the

petitioners and the learned Additional        State      Public

Prosecutor appearing for respondent-State.


</p><p id="p_5">     4.    The main grounds urged by the learned

counsel for the petitioners are that, petitioners are

innocent and they have not committed any offence as

alleged against them. Only because of the earlier incident

which has taken place between the complainant and the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                              4</span>




accused persons and in order to take revenge against the

petitioners, a false case has been registered. He would

further contend that the alleged offence is not punishable

with death of imprisonment for life.     He would further

contend that, test identification parade has also not been

conducted by the police during the course of the

investigation.    He would further contend that, the

petitioners are the permanent residents of Nelogi village

and have got both movable and immovable properties and

they are ready to abide by the conditions to be imposed by

this Court and they are also ready to offer sureties. On

these grounds, he prays for allowing the petition.


</p><p id="p_6">      5. On the contrary, learned Additional State Public

Prosecutor appearing for the respondent-State vehemently

contended that, the petitioners only with an intention to

commit the dacoity came to the spot, assaulted with knife

and other weapons and thereafter they snatched the gold

chain and cash of Rs.4,000/- from the possession of

complainant.     He would further contend that petitioners
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                              5</span>




are absconding and are not available for the purpose of

investigation or interrogation. He would further contend

that at this stage if the petitioners are released on bail,

they may abscond and they may not be available for trial.

On these grounds, he prays for dismissal of the petition.


</p><p id="p_7">      6.    I have gone through the copy of the FIR,

complaint and other material produced along with the

petition.
</p>
<p id="p_8">
</p><p id="p_9">      7.    As could be seen from the contents of the

complaint, which clearly discloses that on the alleged date

of incident when the complainant along with other two

persons were proceeding for attending the second nature

call and at that time, petitioners came there, assaulted

and abused the complainant in filthy language besides

snatching gold chain and cash of Rs.4000/- from the

complainant.
</p>
<p id="p_10">
</p><p id="p_11">      8.    Be that as it may. The complainant has

specifically mentioned the names of all the accused
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                              6</span>




persons in the complaint and even he is aware of the fact

that all the accused persons are belonging to his village.

When the said incident has taken place at 8:10 p.m. that

too when the complainant was knowing the accused

persons, then under such circumstances, the question of

test identification parade does not arise at all. Be that as

it may. The alleged offence is not punishable with death

or imprisonment for life.   When the petitioners are also

permanent resident of the same village and the petitioners

are ready to abide by the conditions to be imposed by this

Court, including offering sureties, then under such

circumstances, I feel that by imposing some stringent

conditions, if the petitioners are enlarged on bail, it is

going to meet the ends of justice.
</p>
<p id="p_12">      For the aforementioned reasons, the petition is

allowed.
</p>
<p id="p_13">      The respondent-Police are hereby directed to release

the petitioners/accused Nos.1 to 10 on bail, in the event of

their arrest, for the above said offences, subject to the

following conditions :-
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                7</span><p id="p_14">
