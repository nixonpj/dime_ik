                   ----------------------------
                  W.P.(C) No.36401 of 2016
            ----------------------------------------
          Dated this the 14th day of November, 2016
                           JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">     As per Ext.P1 Birth Certificate, date of birth of the

petitioner is 19.9.1996. However, while submitting application

form for admission to the 4th respondent school, date of birth

was wrongly entered as 19.9.1997, evident from Ext.P3.

Consequent to which Ext.P3 certificate is issued in the year,

2013 by second and third respondents with the date of birth

as   19.9.1997.    Petitioner   has   submitted       application   for

correction of Ext.P3 certificate by entering the correct date of

birth shown in Ext.P1. However, citing delay, application was

rejected as per Ext.P5. It is in this background seeking

appropriate direction, this writ petition is filed.

</p><p id="p_2">     2.   Heard learned counsel for the petitioner, learned

Standing Counsel for the first respondent and perused the

documents and pleadings.
</p>
<p id="p_3">     3.   The issue with respect to the correction of the date

of Birth on the basis of a certificate issued by the Births and

Deaths authority was considered by a Division Bench of this
W.P.(C) No.36401 of 2016
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                2</span>

Court in <a href="/doc/158477678/" id="a_1">Subin Mohammed v. Union of India</a> [2016(1) KLT

340] and held that once an entry is made in the register

maintained by competent authority in accordance with the

Registration of Births and Deaths Rules 1999 (Kerala), it

raises a presumption of correctness to the date of birth entry.

Taking into account the fact situations and circumstances

thereunder the Division Bench of this Court directed the first

respondent to correct the Date of Birth by imposing a fine of

Rs.5,000/-. I think petitioner is also entitled to get the same

treatment.
</p>
<p id="p_4">      4.     Therefore, there will be a direction to the first

respondent to carry out necessary corrections, taking into

account Ext.P1 birth certificate and take a decision finally

within a period of three weeks from the date of receipt of a

copy of this judgment and on production of receipt of the

payment of fine of Rs.5,000/-
