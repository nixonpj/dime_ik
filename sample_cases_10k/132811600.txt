                 In re:- Ashok Sharma Vs. State
                          (PC No. 397/06)


       (Petition u/s 263 of the <a href="/doc/1450343/" id="a_1">Indian Succession Act</a> for
          revocation of grant of Letter of Administration
                    ****************************


JUDGMENT :
</pre>
<p id="p_1">1.        Non applicant Sh. Ashok Sharma had filed a petition
bearing No. 397/06 on 15-4-2006 in the court for grant of Probate in
respect of Will dated 15.2.1994 executed by his mother, Smt.
Kaushalya Devi. In that petition he alleged that he was the only legal
heir of the deceased Smt. Kaushalya Devi, who had expired on
3.5.1994. He further stated in his petition that the property bearing
No. 60/6, Prabhat Road, Karol Bagh, New Delhi, having area of 474
sq, yards forming part of khasra no. XVI/8027 was purchased by
Sh. Rijhumal from DDA and after his death on the basis of the
probate granted by Bombay High Court, it come into possession of
his son Sh. Mehta Ram. It is further stated in the petition that Sh.
Mehta Ram in respect of this property executed a Will on 2-9-1993
in favour of Smt. Kaushalya Devi, who      was occupying Hanuman
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                        2</span>

Mandir situated in the property in dispute.          In Para no 12 of the
petition, it is stated that Sh. Mehta Ram had expired in Delhi and
after his death Smt. Kaushalya Devi become owner of the property
which was subsequently bequeathed in favour of the petitioner by
virtue of her Will dated 15.2.1994. It is important to mention here
that non applicant Sh. Ashok Sharma neither filed original nor copy
of the Will executed by Sh. Mehta Ram in favour of Smt. Kaushalya
Devi nor his death certificate was placed on record of Probate
petition bearing no. 397/06


</p><p id="p_2">2.        The court vide order dated 23.12.2006 granted Letter of
Administration in favour of the non applicant on the basis of the Will
of Smt. Kaushalya Devi in respect of the property in question who
completed the necessary formalities, paid the court fees and
obtained the formal certificate of Letter of Administration from court
on 19.1.2007.
</p>

<p id="p_3">3.        Present   petition   under       <a href="/doc/121037379/" id="a_2">section   263</a>   of   the   Indian
Succession Act has been filed by Sh. Mehta Ram for revocation of
the Letter of Administration granted in favour of non applicant on
grounds of playing fraud upon court as well as concealment of facts
who also filed reply of the same. I have heard counsel for the parties
and gone through the record because I am of the view that this
petition under <a href="/doc/121037379/" id="a_3">Section 263</a> of the Act can be disposed off without
any evidence due to some admissions made in reply of non applicant
Sh. Ashok Sharma.
</p>

<p id="p_4">4.        First of all the fact regarding happening of death of Sh.
Mehta Ram alleged in the Probate petition is found wrong because
Sh. Mehta Ram is still alive and has filed the present petition for
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                      3</span>

revocation of Letter of Administration. This fact is now not disputed
by non applicant Sh. Ashok Sharma that his averment in the
probate petition regarding the death       of Sh. Mehta Ram was
incorrect but he has taken a new strange plea in his reply that he
presumed death of Sh. Mehta Ram as he was not heard for more
than 7 years and his whereabouts were not known but in this regard
I have to say that this strange and contradictory plea taken is an
after-thought plea and was not mentioned any where in his original
probate petition. In the probate petition, he had categorically stated
that Sh. Mehta Ram had expired in Delhi but now a different
contradictory story is being alleged regarding his presumed civil
death. Certainly the fact mentioned in the Probate petition regarding
happening of death of Sh. Mehta Ram is totally incorrect fact.
</p>

<p id="p_5">5.          In the probate petition, Hanuman Mandir allegedly in
possession of Smt. Kaushalya Devi was described as a part of the
property No. 60/6, Prabhat Road, Karol Bagh, consisting of 474
square yards but now in the reply to the present revocation petition,
a contradictory stand is taken that Hanuman Mandir is not a part of
this property but is situated outside of the same. Non applicant
cannot be permitted to take contradictory stand to back-out from
the averments made in the original petition.           The Letter of
Administration was granted in respect of whole of property including
Hanuman Mandir which was described as part of it and now that
Letter of Administration can not be allowed to be bifurcated due to
taking of contradictory stand by holding that it would remain valid
for Hanuman Mandir and could be revoked for remaining part of
property.
</p>

<p id="p_6">6.          It is also an admitted fact that non applicant had already
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                       4</span>

sold the property in question by way of registered sale deed in favour
of his wife Smt. Parkash Rani much before filing of the Probate
petition in the court. This admission leads to the inference that he
had lost all his rights, title and interest of the property but still he
filed the probate petition by concealing this fact to claim and revive
all the rights over the property in question. This concealment of the
material fact amounts to commission of fraud upon the court and
misleading the court to obtain favourable orders.
</p>

<p id="p_7">7.         Smt. Kaushalya Devi, otherwise, also had not become the
owner of the property in question on the basis of the Will of
Sh.Mehta Ram because Sh. Mehta Ram is still alive and the Will
becomes effective only from the time of death of its maker and before
death it has no value and does not transfer any right or interest.
When Smt. Kaushalya Devi had not acquired any right, title or
interest in the property (even if for the sake of arguments it is
presumed that Sh. Mehta Ram had executed a Will in her favour)
due to fact that testator is still alive, then in that situation also she
was not competent to bequeath the same in favour of her son i.e.
non applicant. The use of words 'his property' in definition of Will
under <a href="/doc/1481078/" id="a_4">Section 2</a> (h) of the <a href="/doc/1450343/" id="a_5">Indian Succession Act</a> clearly point out
that the Will can be executed only in respect of his own property by
the testator. When Smt. Kaushalya Devi was not having any right,
title or interest in the property then she could not transfer any better
title to her son through the Will.
</p>

<p id="p_8">8.         In the probate petition, non applicant Sh. Ashok Kumar
specifically stated that Rijhumal was the owner of the property and
his son Sh. Mehta Ram become the owner after his death on the
basis of the probate granted by Bombay High Court but now in Para
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                       5</span>

no. 4 on merits of reply of revocation petition, these facts are denied.
Non applicant is now contradicting contents of his own probate
petition and it can be said that either he earlier disclosed false facts
in his petition or now is telling lie in this regard in the present reply.
Non applicant is taking contradictory stand and by concealing the
material facts especially death of Sh. Mehta Ram had played fraud
upon the court and by misleading the court           obtained Letter of
Administration wrongly. I am of the view that these above grounds
are sufficient to revoke and cancel the Letter of Administration
granted to non applicant vide order dated 23.12.2006. Present
Petition under <a href="/doc/121037379/" id="a_6">Section 263</a> of the Indian Succession Act is thus
allowed. The original probate petition bearing no. 397/06 filed by
non applicant Sh. Ashok Sharma due to concealment of the real
facts and committing fraud upon court is deemed to have been
dismissed.
</p>

<p id="p_9">9.           There is one another application filed by SHO DBG Road
for making complaint under <a href="/doc/621703/" id="a_7">Section        195</a> Cr.P.C. to the Court of
CMM. On the basis of some complaint of forgery and cheating, a
criminal case has already been registered against the non applicant
Sh. Ashok Kumar and others. Since, I have already held above that
non applicant Sh. Ashok Kumar had filed a Probate petition by
concealing the real facts and on false averments, so I also deem it
proper in view of his contradictory stand taken now from the earlier
petition in his reply to the present petition under <a href="/doc/121037379/" id="a_8">Section 263</a> of the
Indian Succession Act, he should be prosecuted in the interest of
justice for offence of perjury and for making a false claim in the
court. I am not giving any opinion at this stage, whether the Will of
Smt. Kaushalya Devi dated 15.2.1994 is forged or not in absence of
any evidence to contrary on record or whether attesting witnesses of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                       6</span>

same namely Sh. Deepak Sharma and Sh. Vikram were instruments
in getting that alleged forged Will prepared. Hence, I am of the view
that complaint under <a href="/doc/621703/" id="a_9">Section 195</a> Cr.P.C. be sent to the Court of
CMM only against the non applicant Sh. Ashok Kumar. Law is
otherwise settled that the formal complaint under <a href="/doc/621703/" id="a_10">Section               195</a>
Cr.P.C. is not required when a document is forged prior to its filing
in the court.    This above observation of non filing of complaint
against Sh. Deepak Sharma and Sh. Vikram would not came
prejudice in the criminal case against them in any manner
registered vide FIR No. 265/08 P.S. D.B.G. Road It is thus, directed
that a proper complaint under <a href="/doc/621703/" id="a_11">Section 195</a> Cr.P.C. be sent to the
Court of CMM against non applicant Sh. Ashok Kumar.
</p>

<p id="p_10">10.         There is one another application of the police for
providing original Will of Smt. Kaushalya Devi            for purpose of
sending the same to FSL to get the opinion of hand writing expert.
As original Will is required by experts and would be helpful in
effective investigation of criminal case, so this application is allowed.
Let the original Will of Smt. Kaushalya Devi lying on the record be
handed over to SHO, DBG Road against proper receipt but its
photocopy be kept on record. SHO is directed that original Will shall
be returned to the court after obtaining the expert opinion of the
FSL.
</p>

<p id="p_11">11.         As    the   original   formal   certificate   of   Letter    of
Administration has already been deposited by the non applicant in
the court so nothing more is required but it is ordered that all the
proceedings done or action taken on basis of this certificate shall
deem to be invalid, illegal and having no force.

195</a> Cr.P.C. Is sent to court of CMM within 7 days.
