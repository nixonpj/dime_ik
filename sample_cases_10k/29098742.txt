     THIS WRIT PETITION COMING ON FOR FINAL
HEARING THIS DAY, THE COURT MADE THE FOLLOWING:

                         ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">       The petitioners are the owners of the agricultural

lands bearing Sy. No.474 /2A measuring 5 acres 34 guntas

situated at Agadi village, Haveri taluk.   The father of

respondent Nos.3 to 6 filed Form No.7 for grant of

occupancy rights.     By the order dated 05.05.1976,

occupancy rights were granted. The same was challenged

in Writ Petition No.4392 of 1981 before the High Court.

The order of the Land Tribunal was set aside and the

matter was remanded for a fresh enquiry.    By the order

dated 30.01.2003, occupancy rights were again granted to

respondents 3 to 6. Aggrieved by the same, the present

petition is filed.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                  4</span><p id="p_2">




</p><p id="p_3">      2.     Learned counsel for the petitioners contends

that the order of the Tribunal is erroneous and liable to be

set aside.   That the record of rights do not indicate the

name of the tenants.     That the name of one Mallappa is

shown as a tenant of the land in question. He has not filed

Form No.7. Therefore, the Tribunal committed an error in

granting the same.
</p>
<p id="p_4">
</p><p id="p_5">      3.     On the other hand, counsel for the respondents

disputes the same.     He contends that Mallappa is none

other than the elder brother of the father of respondents 3

to 6. That they are all in the joint family. Since Mallappa

was not well, an application was filed on his behalf.

Therefore, there is no reason to disbelieve the order of the

Tribunal.
</p>
<p id="p_6">
</p><p id="p_7">      4.     Having heard learned counsels and examining

the records, I'am of the considered view that appropriate

relief requires to be granted.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                               5</span><p id="p_8">




</p><p id="p_9">      5.     Admittedly, the name of Mallappa is entered as

a tenant of the land in question. Name of the father of

respondents 3 to 6 do not find a place in the record of

rights.    The plea of the respondents is that, they have

stated in the evidence that the joint family together owns

about 80 acres of land. That since Mallappa was not well,

Form No.7 has been filed by the father of respondent

Nos.3 to 6. However, that is not the finding recorded by

the Tribunal. The Tribunal proceeds on the basis that for

the year 1966-67 onwards, the name of the respondents

appeared. Same is a misconstruction of the records.      The

records, admittedly, clearly indicate the name of Mallappa

alone. It does not indicate the name of the respondents

herein.    Therefore, the basis for grant of occupancy rights

to the respondents is misplaced. Admittedly, the record of

rights stand in the name of Mallappa.      Mallappa is not a

tenant.    He is not a party to the proceedings. Therefore,

when the records of rights stand in the name of Mallappa,

the grant of occupancy rights to the respondents is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                               6</span>




unjustified.   The evidence as led-in by the respondents

also would not come to their aid. They have only narrated

the composition of their family. The same is not sufficient

to sustain their plea that their entire family are tenants of

the land in question when admittedly it is only Mallappa's

name, as an individual, which has been entered in the

record of rights.
</p>
<p id="p_10">
</p><p id="p_11">      For the aforesaid reasons, the petition is allowed.

The order dated 30.01.2003 passed by the Land Tribunal,

Haveri, in KRA:YEN:OCP:ASR 194 vide Annexure-B is set

aside. Form No.7 filed by the father of respondents 3 to 6

is rejected.
</p>
<p id="p_12">      Rule made absolute.
