90    17.5.2013                       W.P. 15016 (W) of 2013
akb
                                         Profulla Bairagya
                                              -Versus-
                                  The State of West Bengal &amp; Ors.

                  Mr. Dilip Kumar Maiti
                                   ...For Petitioner.
                  Ms. Aparna Ghosh
                                   ...For State.

                                 Affidavit-of-service filed on behalf of the
                  petitioner in Court today be kept with the record.

                                 This writ petition is filed by the writ
                  petitioner    for    a   direction    upon      the   respondent</pre>
<p id="p_1">                  authorities to pay interest on gratuity for belated
                  payment of the same.
</p>
<p id="p_2">                                 Having heard the learned Counsel appearing for the
                  respective parties and also considering the facts and circumstances
                  of the case, I find that the petitioner was a Group 'D' staff of
                  Jamsherpur B. N. Hogalbaria High School, District - Nadia and the
                  petitioner retired from the above service on February 28, 2006 on
                  attaining the age of retirement on superannuation.
</p>

<p id="p_3">                                 First payment was made to the petitioner
                  on September 20, 2006.           First payment on the basis
                  such revision was made on February 10, 2012.
</p>
<p id="p_4">                                                  A prayer is made on behalf of the
                                   petitioner not to press the claim of interest on
                                   gratuity on first payment for delayed payment of
                                   the same and to confine the prayer of the
                                   petitioner in respect of the benefit of West Bengal
                                   Non-Government Aided Educational Institutions
                                   Employees (Revision of Pay and Allowances) Rules,
                                   2009 or interest for delayed payment of that
                                   benefit, as the case may be.
</p><p id="p_5">                                 The point of law, which is involved in this
                  writ application, has already been settled by a judgment
                  delivered by a Single Bench of this Court in W.P. 10750
                  (W) of 2007 on July 9, 2008 in the matter of <a href="/doc/67298412/" id="a_1">Abha
                  Acharya -vs- State of West Bengal &amp; Others</a>. In the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                      2</span>



above case the petitioner was a primary school teacher
and there was delay in releasing his gratuity money.
Operative portion of the above decision is quoted below
:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">               "Following the said Judgment and/or
               Order, I dispose of W.P. No. 1867 (W) of
               2007 on 04.04.2008 and in other similar
               matters, I observed that since the issue was
               similar, the Order that I had passed in the
               said W.P. No. 1867 (W) of 2007 should
               govern those cases also.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">               However today when this huge pile of cases
               were heard, a submission was made which
               was not made in the cases before me
               referred to above, and which was to the
               effect   that   there    cannot    be   any
               adjudication on the question as to who was
               responsible for delay in matters pertaining
               to payment of gratuity because the
               entitlement to gratuity is automatic and is
               to be paid on the very day the person
               retires. Even the learned Advocate General
               did not dispute this contention and very
               frankly and fairly stated that so far as the
               gratuity is concerned, it has to be paid on
               the date the person retires with the only
               exception that it can be withheld in cases
               where a departmental action is pending
               against the concerned employee."</blockquote>


<p id="p_6">               On the basis of the above observation, direction was
given to the respondent authority to pay interest of gratuity at the
rate of 10% per annum. I do not find any reason for disagreeing
with the above decision.
</p>
<p id="p_7">               Accordingly, I direct the respondent authority to
give 9% interest per annum on the revised gratuity amount paid to
the petitioner for a period from the date of retirement of the
petitioner up to the date of its actual payment. Such payment shall
be made within 90 days from the date of communication of this
order along with copy of this writ application upon the Director of
Pension, Provident Fund and Group Insurance, Government of
West Bengal as also the concerned Treasury Officer.
</p>

<p id="p_8">               It is further made clear that failure on the
part of the respondent authority to pay the aforesaid
interest within the stipulated time, an additional
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                       3</span>



interest at the rate of 2% per annum shall be paid to the
petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_9">                 It is necessary to point out that the rate of
interest    is   fixed    at   9%    per    annum       taking   into
consideration the highest rate of interest payable by a
nationalised bank on fixed deposit.
</p>
<p id="p_10">                 The writ petition, is, thus, disposed of.
                 However, there will be no order as to costs.
</p>
<p id="p_11">                 Urgent photostat certified copy of this order, if
applied for, be supplied to the parties, on priority basis.
</p>
