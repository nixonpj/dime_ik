            IN THE HIGH COURT OF KARNATAKA

                   KALABURAGI BENCH

        DATED THIS THE 13TH DAY OF JULY 2015

                          BEFORE

  THE HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE K.N.PHANEENDRA

           CRIMINAL PETITION No.200577/2015

Between:

Munna S/o Maktumsab
Hosanatikar,
Aged about: 28 years,
Occ: Business,
R/o Jalawad village,
Tq: Sindagi,
Dist: Vijapur.

                                        ... Petitioner
(By Sri. Shivanand Patil, Advocate)

And:

The State by
Devar Hipparagi P.S.,
Represented by:
State Public Prosecutor
Kalaburagi.

                                      ... Respondent
(By Sri. P.S. Patil, HCGP)
                                2


     This Criminal Petition is filed under <a href="/doc/1783708/" id="a_1">Section 438</a> of Cr.P.C.
praying to allow the petition and issue directions to Devar
Hipparagi Police Station to Release/Accused No.1 on bail in the
event of arrest in Devar Hipparagi P.S. Crime No:76/2015, which
is registered for the offences P/U/S. 341, 323, 504, 307 R/w 34
<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_2">IPC</a>.

      This petition coming on for Orders this day, the Court
made the following:

                         ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">      The petitioner has approached this Court for grant

of anticipatory bail in connection with Crime No.76/2015

of Devar Hipparagi Police Station for the offences

U/Sec.341, 323, 504, 307 R/w Sec.34 of <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_3">IPC</a>.


</p><p id="p_2">      2.     The case of the prosecution is that :-


      A person by name Ramangouda Patil has lodged a

complaint     stating   that   on    29-5-2015      when     the

complainant's brother Siddu @ Siddangouda had been to

tender his vote in Gram Panchayat election, he went to a

cool drink's shop of Mutali Hussain Hosanatikar. At that
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                             3</span>


time, the petitioner was present in the said shop. The

brother of complainant Siddu questioned said Mutali

Hussain Hosanatikar that he has been demanding and

taking more money for the cool drinks than the regular

price. It appears the quarrel took place between the

accused persons and said Siddu and in that context the

accused persons by name Haji Babu Gunaki, Ahmed

Sahiblal Waddadagi have caught hold the injured and the

petitioner who was there in the shop came outside and

assaulted on his head with a bottle. The brother of the

complainant Siddu has sustained some injuries and he was

admitted to the hospital.
</p>
<p id="p_3">
</p><p id="p_4">     3.    The     police   have   registered   the   case

particularly U/Sec.341, 323, 504, 307 R/w 34 of <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_4">IPC</a>, but,

there is no registration of the case for the offence

U/Sec.324 of <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_5">IPC</a>. Therefore, at this stage, it is very
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                              4</span>


difficult to draw an inference that merely because of the

quarrel, some assault has been made with their hands and

bottle by the accused and i.e., sufficient to attract the

provisions of Sec.307 of <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_6">IPC</a>. In order to ascertain this

factum, the Court has directed learned HCGP to ascertain

whether the injured is still taking treatment or discharged

from the hospital. The learned HCGP submitted that the

injured has already been discharged from the hospital, but

the learned HCGP has not produced any discharge

summary or the injury certificate to show that the injured

has suffered any injuries as such on his head and on other

parts of the body. Under the above said circumstances, it

appears the incident happened in a spur of moment due

to the quarrel between two groups and in that context the

incident happened. So, in my opinion, the petitioner has

made out grounds for grant of anticipatory bail as sought
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                              5</span>


for and he shall be released with stringent conditions.

Hence, I pass the following :
