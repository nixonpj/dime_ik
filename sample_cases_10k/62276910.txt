             (DHARMENDRA Vs THE STATE OF MADHYA PRADESH)


11-01-2017

Shri Sanjay Kumar Sharma, learned counsel for the
applicants.
Shri Abhishek Soni, learned Dy. Govt. Advocate for the
non-applicant/State.
Heard.
                       ORDER
</pre>


<p id="p_1">This is the first bail application under <a href="/doc/1290514/" id="a_1">Section 439</a> Cr.P.C
by applicants/Kapil Kumar and Dharmendra, who have
been arrested by Police on 24/09/2016 and 23/09/2016
respectively in Crime No.117/2016, Police Station-
Balwada, District-Khargone, in connection with offence
under <a href="/doc/90679/" id="a_2">Sections 25</a> (1-b) (a) and 27 <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_3">Arms Act</a>. No other bail
application is filed, pending or decided by any other
court, by this Court or before the Hon'ble Apex Court. Bail
application has been rejected by the Additional Sessions
Judge, Barwaha vide order dated 27/10/2016 and
29/10/2016 respectively.
</p><p id="p_2">2. Apart from the regular arguments of false implication,
no possibility of absconding and trial is likely to take long
time, learned counsel for the applicants submitted that
charge-sheet has been filed under <a href="/doc/73862/" id="a_4">Section 25</a> (1-A), 25 (1-
AA), 27 and 29 of the <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_5">Arms Act</a> and invited my attention
to the provisions of these Sections. He argued that
 <a href="/doc/73862/" id="a_6">Section 25</a> (1-A) and 25 (1-AA) of the Act provides
punishment for having in possession etc. a prohibited fire
arm while arms alleged to have been seized from the
applicants does not fall under the definition of prohibited
fire arms given in <a href="/doc/124983/" id="a_7">Section 2</a> (i) of the Act. It is urged that
there is no evidence that applicants have imported the
seized fire arms or used the same, therefore, charges
under which the charge-sheet has been filed are not
made out prima facie. Thus, prayer is made for releasing
the applicants on bail.
</p><p id="p_3">3. The prayer is opposed by learned counsel for the non-
applicant/State.
</p><p id="p_4">4. According to the prosecution case, the applicants were
found travelling in the Bus. On search they were found in
possession of 10-10 pistols kept in the bag they were
carrying. The pistols were covered in the shawl and paper
respectively. They were not having any valid license for
having possession or carrying these pistols. They were
arrested and brought to police station. On interrogation
they revealed that they have brought these pistols from
one Nadan Singh. On their information, the police party
raid the place pointed out by them. At that place accused-
Nadan Singh S/o Chhotu Singh was found standing with
his motor-cycle but he ran away leaving the motorcycle
there. A bag containing 10 pistols was found hanging on
the motor-cycle. The Pistols were seized. Nadan Singh is
still absconding.
</p><p id="p_5">5. Considering that such a huge quantity of illegal fire
 arms recovered from the possession of the present
applicants, I do not think it proper to release them on bail
at this stage. So far as contention relating as to which
provision of the Act covers the act of the applicants is
concerned that is a matter of fact, which can be
considered by the learned trial Court at proper stage of
trial or proceedings, therefore, applications filed by both
the applicants stand dismissed.
