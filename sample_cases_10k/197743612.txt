<p id="p_1">                               The petitioners seek the concession of pre-arrest bail in a case

            registered at the instance of Shamsher Singh alleging that on the day of

            the Parliamentary Elections, the complainant was assaulted by the

            petitioners, constituting an unlawful assembly. Shamsher Singh suffered

            four fractures on the face and hands. So far as the petitioners are

            concerned, they have not been attributed any specific injuries.

            petition for pre-arrest bail contending that the petitioners were members of

            the unlawful assembly and they had participated in the occurrence,

            resulting in fractures on the person of the complainant and that it is a case

            of mob attack. A perusal of the police file indicates that it is a cross version

            case and that Bhajan Singh, on the side of the petitioners, had also

            suffered injuries. Copy of the cross version has been placed on record as

            Annexure P-3.

            activities on the part of the petitioners, it will be open to the complainant to

            seek cancellation of bail.
