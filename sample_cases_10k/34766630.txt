CORAM: HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE AHSANUDDIN AMANULLAH
       Patna High Court Cr.Misc. No.38502 of 2012 (9) dt.16-04-2014

                                                 2/4




                                                       ORAL ORDER</pre>


<p id="p_1">9   16-04-2014                   Heard Mr. Dilip Kumar Roy, learned counsel for

                   Aanjila Kumari (petitioner in Cr. Misc. No. 38502 of 2012 and

                   opposite party no. 2 in Cr. Misc. No. 16608 of 2014), Mrs. Mira

                   Kumari, learned counsel for Birendra Kumar @ Birendra Kumar

                   Rai @ Birendra Kumar Mahto (opposite party no. 2 in Cr. Misc.

                   No. 38502 of 2012 and petitioner in Cr. Misc. No. 16608 of 2014)

                   as well as Mr. Sanjay Kumar, learned A.P.P. appearing for the

                   State in Cr. Misc. No. 38502 of 2012 and Mr. Lalan Kumar,

                   learned A.P.P. appearing for the State in Cr. Misc. No. 16608 of

                   2014. The parties are husband and wife.
</p>
<p id="p_2">                                  Both the cases arise out of order granting bail to the

                   husband dated 28.05.2012 in Cr. Misc. No. 17742 of 2012. In Cr.

                   Misc. No. 38502 of 2012 the wife seeks cancellation of the bail

                   granted to the husband whereas in Cr. Misc. No. 16608 of 2014

                   the husband seeks modification of the order granting bail.

</p><p id="p_3">                                  Learned counsel appearing for the wife in Cr. Misc.

                   No. 38502 of 2012 submitted that despite having agreed before the

                   Court, the husband had violated the terms and conditions

                   inasmuch as the undertaking to return all the articles including

                   jewelleries to the wife within two months from his coming out of

                   jail has not been complied with due to which the Court had earlier

                   issued notice to the husband. Subsequently, the court below itself
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1"> Patna High Court Cr.Misc. No.38502 of 2012 (9) dt.16-04-2014</span>

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                           3/4</span>




             had proceeded against him and has cancelled his bail bonds and he

             has also been taken into custody.
</p>
<p id="p_4">                            The husband in turn has filed Cr. Misc. No. 16608 of

             2014 seeking modification of portion of the order by which he has

             been directed to return all the articles including jewelleries to the

             wife.
</p>
<p id="p_5">                            On the last occasion, learned counsels for the parties

             were called upon to ascertain the views of their respective clients

             as to whether the wife would be ready to stay with the husband or

             the husband was ready to pay Rs. 6 lacs to the wife as a one time

             settlement. Learned counsels for the parties have submitted before

             the Court today that neither is the wife ready to reside with the

             husband nor the husband is ready to pay Rs. 6 lacs as a one time

             settlement.
</p>
<p id="p_6">                            In view of the aforesaid, taking into account the fact

             that while granting bail to the husband (petitioner in Cr. Misc. No.

             17742 of 2012) by order dated 28.05.2012, this Court had

             specifically directed him to return all the articles including

             jewelleries to his wife within two months from his coming out of

             jail failing which the court below was to cancel the bail granted to

             the petitioner and take him into custody, this Court is of the

             opinion that the husband has violated the terms and conditions

             upon which bail was granted after giving an undertaking before
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">            Patna High Court Cr.Misc. No.38502 of 2012 (9) dt.16-04-2014</span>

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                                      4/4</span>




                        the Court. The order dated 28.05.2012 records that the petitioner is

                        ready to return all the articles including the jewelleries which were

                        received at the time of marriage from the side of the wife

                        (complainant). For the reasons aforesaid, Cr. Misc. No. 38502 of

                        2012 stands allowed. The bail granted to the petitioner in Cr.

                        Misc. No. 17742 of 2012 by order dated 28.05.2012 stands

                        cancelled.
</p>
<p id="p_7">                                       In view of the discussions made above, Cr. Misc. No.

                        16608 of 2014 stands dismissed as this Court finds that no grounds

                        have been made out for modification of the terms and conditions

                        of the order dated 28.05.2012 passed in Cr. Misc. No. 17742 of

                        2012. Furthermore, the husband being aware of the conditions of

                        bail in order dated 28.05.2012, came out of jail on 12.06.2012 on

                        the basis of such order, but did not comply with the same within

                        the stipulated two months and only after the wife having filed Cr.

                        Misc. No. 38502 of 2012 in September, 2012 for cancellation of

                        his bail, by way of a counterblast filing Cr. Misc. No. 16608 of

                        2014 in September, 2013, does not deserve any indulgence.
