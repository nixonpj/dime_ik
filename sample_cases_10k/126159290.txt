yesterday before us. The learned counsel for petitioners invited

our attention to the communication issued by the respondent

is declared as a Cut-off date. It is also stated in clause 3 of the

communication that the State Assembly Roll (Voters Electoral

our attention to clause 6 of the communication, wherein, the

election programme is referred to. The counsel for the petitioner

submitted that there was sufficient time provided for submitting

the objections and the last date provided as per the programme

was 25th January 2019. Then the learned counsel, by inviting our

attention to a gazette notification dated 15th January 2019,

submitted that a change is effected by way of this communication,

and the Election Commission declared earlier circular dated

9th January 2019, whereby it was stated that 11 th January 2019

would be the qualifying date for the roll. Then by clause 3 of this

election programme, declared under communication dated

21st January 2019 and then by referring to clause 6 of this

communication, the learned counsel Mr. Palodkar submitted that

as per this election programme there is hardly any time for the

persons who are willing to raise objections and it was further

submitted by the learned counsel that till date i.e. till Yesterday

there is no publication of the voters roll.
</p>
<p id="p_6">3.               Then another objection was raised by the learned

counsel by inviting our attention to communication/order dated

22.01.2019. It was submitted by the learned counsel Mr. Palodkar

that the place chosen for submitting objections or suggestions is

the office of the Collector, Aurangabad.                      It was the further

submission of Mr. Palodkar, the learned counsel that it would be

inconvenient for those who are willing to raise objections to travel

from Sillod and to attend the Collector Office at Aurangabad for

submitting            their         suggestions/objections      within          such        a

limited/short span.                 On considering these submissions on the

backdrop of an urgency claimed, we have called upon the learned

counsel Mr. Kadethankar who appears for respondent No.2 -

Election Commission.

</p><p id="p_9">4.               The learned counsel Mr. Kadethankar was fair enough

to submit before this Court that he is not having instructions but if

some time is given, he may immediately contact the officers

concerned and submit instructions before this Court. Accordingly,

the matter was kept today for hearing/disposal at Sr. No.1.

</p><p id="p_10">5.               Today, Mr. Kadethankar, the learned counsel appearing

for respondent No. 2 - Election Commission, makes a statement

on instructions from the Officer of the State Election Commission,

who is present in this Court, that yesterday itself the voters roll is

made available on the website and the desirous persons may

certainly obtain this information by way of opening the website.

The learned counsel Mr. Kadethankar also fairly submitted that

some delay is caused in making available the voters roll on

website and due to certain technical aspects, the voters roll was

made available on the website at late hours, but right now

anybody who is desirous can certainly avail this information by

approaching and opening the website. The learned counsel Mr.

Kadethankar, on instructions, further submitted that the voters roll

would be made available to the parties today itself if they

approach the competent Election Officer.           Mr. Kadethankar on

further instructions then submitted that care is also taken to

redress another grievance of the petitioners and on instructions

Mr. Kadethankar submitted that though by communication dated

22.01.2019            it    was     informed     that   the      place       for     raising

objections/suggestions would be the Municipal Administration

Department of the Collector Office, Aurangabad, the Election

Commission made necessary arrangements to receive objections/

suggestions at Sillod in the office of Sub Divisional Officer, Sillod.

Mr. Kadethankar also submitted that the election programme is

now published and the code of conduct is now in operation.

</p><p id="p_12">6.               It was the submission of Mr. Palodkar, the learned

counsel for the petitioners that, without publishing the voters list,

the election programme is published.
</p>
<p id="p_13">7.               Considering         all   the   above      referred         facts      more

particularly, the submissions of Mr. Kadethankar on instructions

from a competent officer of the Election Commission, we are of

the opinion that the Election Commission not only addressed to

the objections raised by the petitioners but now these grievances

are also redressed by way of making available the voters roll on

website or making available the place nearest to the petitioners

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                                                                             5/6</span>

i.e. in Sillod town itself for submitting objections/suggestions and

in view of the operation of the code of conduct there is no reason

for us to cause any indulgence in the elections. Accordingly, as

now the purpose of the petitioners is served, the petition is

disposed of.

<p id="p_15">8.               We appreciate the prompt response from the State

Election Commission and in turn the response by Mr. Kadethankar

learned counsel appearing for the respondent No. 2 - Election

Commission.
