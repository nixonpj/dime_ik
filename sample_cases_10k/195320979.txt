Date of hearing &amp; Judgment      :    20.10.2011.


                    JUDGMENT AND ORDER(ORAL)

Geol, J :-

        This appeal has been preferred against the judgment and
order dated 23.5.2007 passed by learned Civil Judge (Senior
Division) No.3, Kamrup, Guwahati dismissing the suit of the
appellant mainly on the ground that the jurisdiction of the civil
court was barred.


2.      The Assam State Electricity Board ( for short, hereafter
referred to „ASEB‟) undertook construction of hydro electric
power station in the district of Karbi Anglong on river Borapani.
The execution of the work was entrusted to a contractor and
thereafter to National Project Construction Corporation           and
finally to the appellant on 25.3.1993. Since the project could not be
completed as contemplated and disputes arose between the ASEB
and the appellant leading to filing of the suit by the appellant, the
State of Assam issued an Ordinance on 6.1.1997            which was
followed by      the Bharat Hydro Power Corporation Limited
(Acquisition and <a href="/doc/984780/" id="a_2">Transfer of Undertaking) Act</a>, 1996.( for short, the



RFA No.26/2007                                     Page 2 of 18
 „ Act‟). <a href="/doc/17873873/" id="a_3">Under the Act</a>, the Project was transferred and vested in
the Board and the appellant was entitled only to compensation to
be determined as per the said Act.


3.      The appellant challenged the said Act as violative of the
rights of the appellant under Articles 14 and 19(i)(g) and also on
the ground that the same was beyond legislative competence of
the State legislature. Learned Single Judge of this Court struck
down the Act but the Division Bench of this Court in <a href="/doc/1887306/" id="a_4">Assam State
Electricity Board and Ors vs. Bharat Hydro Power Corporation
Ltd. &amp; Ors</a>, 1998(4) GLT 87      reversed the view taken by the
learned Single Judge and held the Act to be valid. The judgment
of the Division Bench of this Court was affirmed by the Hon‟ble
Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/836572/" id="a_5">Bharat Hydro Power Corpn. Ltd and Ors vs.
State of Assam and another</a>, (2004) 2 SCC 553.


4.       The claim of the appellant filed before the statutory
Commission       was adjudicated upon vide the report dated
14.9.2002 holding the appellant to be entitled to compensation of
Rs.30.87 crores approximately with interest. The State of Assam
challenged   the report of the Commission by filing an appeal
under <a href="/doc/29824443/" id="a_6">section 14(7)</a> of the Act as well as a writ petition under
<a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_7">Article 226</a> of the Constitution to the extent the grievance was
beyond the scope of appeal. The report/award of the Commission
was partly modified vide judgment and order dated 29.3.2004 in
<a href="/doc/1887306/" id="a_8">State of Assam vs. Bharat Hydro Power Corporation              Ltd</a>,
reported in 2004 (1) GLT 510 . We have been informed that so far


RFA No.26/2007                                  Page 3 of 18
 as the appellant is concerned, the said judgment has not been
challenged. The State of Assam filed an appeal which is said to be
pending before the Hon‟ble Supreme Court.


5.         The appellant filed suit in the Court of the Civil judge
(Senior Division) No.3, Kamrup, Guwahati on 16.12.2004 seeking a
decree for about Rs. 7 crores. The said amount relates to interest
and expenses incurred by the appellant.          The State of Assam
contested the suit inter alia on the ground that the jurisdiction of
the civil court was barred under <a href="/doc/981126/" id="a_9">section 9</a> of the Code of Civil
procedure and also on the ground that the subject matter of the
suit was covered by the statutory adjudication under the Act. The
suit was also contested on merits and counter claim was filed by
the State of Assam claiming about Rs. 21 crores.


6.        Following issues were framed -
1) Whether the suit is maintainable in law &amp; fact ?
2) Whether there is cause of action for the suit?
3) Whether this court has territorial jurisdiction to entertain the
suit ?
4) Whether the suit is barred u/s 9 of C.P.C.?
5) Whether the suit is barred by the principle of resjudicata ?
6) Whether the suit is barred by limitation ?
7) Whether the plaintiff have to realize Rs.6,91,47,201.70 from the
     Defendants and interest as claimed in the suit ?
Issues on Counter claim :
8) Whether the counter-claim is maintainable ?


RFA No.26/2007                                      Page 4 of 18
 9) Whether the counter claim made by the defendants No.1 &amp; 2 is
     Barred by limitation.
10.Whether the defendant No.1 is entitled to decree for realization
     Of Rs.21,31,48,065.82 ? and interest as claimed?
11. Whether the defendant No.2 is entitled to get a decree for
     Rs.26667.79 on counter claim and interest as claimed ?
12. To what relief/reliefs the parties are entitled to ?


7.         Vide impugned order, the suit has been dismissed. Issue
No.4 was taken up to be the main issue for consideration, which
was a legal issue.        The said issue was decided against the
appellant mainly on the ground that6 under <a href="/doc/29080593/" id="a_10">Section 5(2)</a> of the
Act, the liability of the company could not be enforced against the
State government.


8.        We have heard Mr GN Sahewalla, learned Senior counsel
for the appellant, Mr PK Khataniar, learned counsel appearing for
the Respondent No.1 and Mr KR Surana, learned counsel for the</pre>
<p id="p_1">Respondent No.2.
</p>

<p id="p_2">9.        Learned senior counsel for the appellant submitted that the
trial court erred in relying upon <a href="/doc/63220125/" id="a_11">section 5</a> of the Act for holding
that the jurisdiction of the civil court was barred. The civil court
had the jurisdiction to deal with the claims which were held to be
beyond the Act in the judgment of this Court dated 29.3.2004.
</p>



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">RFA No.26/2007                                          Page 5 of 18</span>
<p id="p_3"> 10.      Learned     counsel for the State of Assam and ASEB
supported the impugned order by submitting that under the Act,
the right, title and interest of the appellant got transferred and
vested in the State . Under <a href="/doc/34516947/" id="a_12">section 3</a> of the Act, all rights, liabilities
and obligations specified in <a href="/doc/124597428/" id="a_13">section 4</a> of the Act vested in the State
Government. All assets of the company specified therein also got
vested in the State Government, free from all liabilities and
encumbrances. The liabilities of the State government specified
therein are the liabilities of the company. The Board was declared
under <a href="/doc/153045452/" id="a_14">section 6(2)</a> of the Act to be the owner of the undertaking.
<a href="/doc/159294854/" id="a_15">Section 7</a> made the State Government liable to pay the amount
fixed by the Commission to the Company and the amount was to
be calculated    as per <a href="/doc/151534248/" id="a_16">section 8</a> of the Act. Thus, according to
learned counsel for the respondents, rights of appellant in relation
to the undertaking and its dues were exhaustively governed by
the Act. The appellant could not claim any right de hors the Act
nor approach any other forum than that provided under the Act.
</p>

<p id="p_4">11.   Question for consideration is whether civil Court jurisdiction
is barred in view of special forum created under the Act which
limits rights of the appellant to compensation to be determined as
per the Act.
</p>

<p id="p_5">12.    As already noted, that the Act was upheld by the Hon‟ble
Supreme Court . Under the scheme of the statute, the appellant
company was entitled only to the amount as may be determined
as per statutory provision by the Commission to be appointed


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">RFA No.26/2007                                       Page 6 of 18</span>
 under the Act. The      authority to adjudicate upon the rights of
the appellant was exclusively conferred on the Commissioner
under the Act. <a href="/doc/1652403/" id="a_17">The Scheme of the Act</a> as contained in <a href="/doc/159294854/" id="a_18">Sections
7</a>,<a href="/doc/151534248/" id="a_19">8</a>,<a href="/doc/189640290/" id="a_20">12</a> and <a href="/doc/29824443/" id="a_21">14</a> shows that rights and remedies of the Act are as her
the said provisions and there is no right out side the said
provisions. The said rights cannot be claimed before civil Court
but only before the statutory forum.
</p>

<p id="p_6">13.      Legal position as to exclusion of jurisdiction has been
discussed inter alia in         <a href="/doc/321104/" id="a_22">Premier Automobiles vs. Kamlekar
Shantaram Wadke</a>, 1976 (1) SCC 496. There in workers of the
employer filed suit for certain claims which amounted to
"industrial disputes" and fell under <a href="/doc/1418464/" id="a_23">Section 2(k)</a> of the Industrial
Disputes Act, 1947. It was held that since separate machinery had
been created for adjudication, civil court jurisdiction was barred.
Relevant discussion therein is reproduced below :
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_1">            "9. It would thus be seen that through the intervention of
      the appropriate government, of course not directly, a very
      extensive machinery has been provided for settlement and
      adjudication of industrial disputes. But since an individual
      aggrieved cannot approach the Tribunal or the Labour Court
      directly for the redress of his grievance without the intervention of
      the Government, it is legitimate to take the view that the remedy
      provided under the Act is not such as to completely oust the
      jurisdiction of the civil court for trial of industrial disputes. If the
      dispute is not an industrial dispute within the meaning of Section


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">RFA No.26/2007                                           Page 7 of 18</span>
       2(k) or within the meaning of Section 2-A of the Act, it is obvious
      that there is no provision for adjudication of such disputes under
      the Act. Civil courts will be the proper forum. But where the
      industrial dispute is for the purpose of enforcing any right,
      obligation or liability under the general law or the common law
      and not a right, obligation or liability created under the Act, then
      alternative forums are there giving an election to the suitor to
      choose his remedy of either moving the machinery under the Act or
      to approach the civil court. It is plain that he can't have both. He
      has to choose the one or the other. But we shall presently show that
      the civil court will have no jurisdiction to try and adjudicate upon
      an industrial dispute if it concerned enforcement of certain right or
      liability created only under the Act. In that event civil court will
      have no jurisdiction even to grant a decree of injunction to prevent
      the threatened injury on account of the alleged breach of contract if
      the contract is one which is recognized by and enforceable under
      the Act alone.

<blockquote id="blockquote_2">      10. In Doe v. Bridges (1831)1 B &amp; Ad 847 at page 859 are the
      famous and oft-quoted words of Lord Tenterden, C.J. saying:
      "Where an Act creates an obligation and enforces the performance
      in a specified manner, we take it to be a general rule that
      performance cannot be enforced in any other manner."
      This passage was cited with approval by the Earl of Halsbury,
      L.C. in Pasmore v. Oswaldtwistle Urban District Council
      1898 AC 387 and by Lord Simonds in the case of Cutler v.
      Wandsworth Stadium Ltd 1949 AC 398. Classic enunciation of



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">RFA No.26/2007                                         Page 8 of 18</span>
       the law and classification of the cases in three classes was done by
      Willes, J. "with the precision which distinguished the utterances of
      that most accomplished lawyer, in the case of Wolverhampton
      New Waterworks Co. v. Hawkesford" (1959) 6 CB (NS) 336
      (vide the speech of Viscount Haldane in the case of Neville v.
      London "Express", Newspaper, Ltd.) 1919 AC 368. The classes
      are enumerated thus:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">      "There are three classes of cases in which a liability may be
      established by statute. There is that class where there is a liability
      existing at common law, and which is only re-enacted by the
      statute with a special form of remedy; there, unless the statute
      contains words necessarily excluding the common law remedy, the
      plaintiff has his election of proceeding either under the statute or at
      common law. Then there is a second class, which consists of those
      cases in which a statute has created a liability, but has given no
      special remedy for it; there the party may adopt an action of debt or
      other remedy at common law to enforce it. The third class is where
      the statute creates a liability not existing at common law, and
      gives also a particular remedy for enforcing it.... With respect to
      that class it has always been held, that the party must adopt the
      form of remedy given by the statute."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">      11. The judgment of the Court of Appeal which was affirmed by
      the House of Lords in Pasmore case is reported in Peebles v.
      Oswaldtwistle Urban District Council (1897) 1 QB 625. It
      was pointed out that the duty of a local authority, under <a href="/doc/16755409/" id="a_24">Section
      15</a> of the Public Health Act, 1875 to make such sewers as may be
      necessary for effectually draining their district for the purposes of



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">RFA No.26/2007                                          Page 9 of 18</span>
       the Act, cannot be enforced by action for a mandamus, the only
      remedy for neglect of the duty being that given by <a href="/doc/17873873/" id="a_25">Section 299</a> of
      the Act by complaint to the Local Government Board. Lord Esher,
      M.R. pointed out that the liability to make sewers was imposed by
      the statute. There was no such liability before it. The case,
      therefore, comes within the canon of construction that if a new
      obligation is imposed by statute, and in the same statute a remedy
      is provided for non-fulfilment of the obligation, that is the only
      remedy. Lopes, L.J. further succinctly pointed out that <a href="/doc/16755409/" id="a_26">Section 15</a>
      did not create any duty towards any particular individual, and
      <a href="/doc/17873873/" id="a_27">Section 299</a> gives a specific remedy for the benefit of the locality at
      large. Thus, it should be noticed, that the obligation imposed by the
      statute did not result in creation of any right in favour of any
      particular individual. Earl of Halsbury, L.C. pointed out in his
      speech :
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">      "The principle that where a specific remedy is given by a statute, it
      thereby deprives the person who insists upon a remedy of any other
      form of remedy than that given by the statute, is one which is very
      familiar and which runs through the law."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_6">      The matter would be different if the obligation imposed under the
      statute brings into existence a right in favour of an individual but
      provides no remedy for its enforcement. Supposing after providing
      for awarding of certain compensation in Chapter V-A of the Act
      there was no provision made in it like <a href="/doc/126738804/" id="a_28">Section 10</a> or <a href="/doc/17873873/" id="a_29">Section 33-C</a>

       jurisdiction of the civil court for enforcement of the individual
      right created under Chapter V-A.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_7">      12. The decision of the House of Lords in the case of Barraclough
      v. Brown 1897 AC 615 is very much to the point. The special
      statute under consideration there gave a right to recover expenses
      in a court of summary jurisdiction from a person who was not
      otherwise liable at common law. It was held that there was no right
      to come to the High Court for a declaration that the applicant had a
      right to recover the expenses in a court of summary jurisdiction.
      He could take proceedings only in the latter court. Lord Herschell
      after referring to the right conferred under the statute "to recover
      such expenses from the owner of such vessel in a court of summary
      jurisdiction" said :
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_8">      "I do not think the appellant can claim to recover by virtue of the
      statute, and at the same time insist upon doing so by means other
      than those prescribed by the statute which alone confers the right"
      Lord Watson said :
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_9">      "The right and the remedy are given uno flatu, and the one cannot
      be dissociated from the other."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_10">      In other words if a statute confers a right and in the same breath
      provides for a remedy for enforcement of such right the remedy
      provided by the statute is an exclusive one. But as noticed by Lord
      Simonds in Cutler v. Wandsworth Stadium Ltd.(supra) from the
      earlier English cases, the scope and purpose of a statute and in
      particular for whose benefit it is intended has got to be considered.
      If a statute" intended to compel mine owners to make due
      provision for the safety of the men working in their mines, and the

          persons for whose benefit all these rules are to be enforced are the
         persons exposed to danger",
         there arises at common law
         "a co-relative right in these persons who may be injured by its
         contravention".
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_11">         Such a type of case was under consideration before Lord Goddard,
         C.J. in the case of Solomons v. R. Gertzenstein Ltd (1954) 2
         WLR 823. Lord Denning, M.R. relied upon the principles
         enunciated by Lord Tenterden in Doe v. Bridges (supra) approved
         in Pasmore case(supra)        in the case of Southwark London
         Borough Council v. Williams (1971) 1 Ch 734. The celebrated
         and learned Master of the Rolls said:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_12">         "Likewise here in the case of temporary accommodation for those in
         need. It cannot have been intended by Parliament that every
         person who was in need of temporary accommodation should be
         able to sue the local authority for it: or to take the law into his own
         hands for the purpose."

<p id="p_7">14.      Applying the above principle to the present case, we are of
the view that rights and remedies of the appellant are specially
dealt with under the Act, which will exclude jurisdiction of civil
Court.

 to adjudicate upon the matter cannot be accepted. The
 adjudication by the Commission has already taken place in the
 manner as already noted and thereafter nothing survives which

<p id="p_9">16.      Learned senior counsel for the appellant relied upon the

the civil court inspite of special remedy under the Act :

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">RFA No.26/2007                                          Page 16 of 18</span>
<blockquote id="blockquote_38">            "There is no manner of doubt that an equitable principle of
            law, as laid down by the Apex Court, the company would be
            and may be entitled to interest from the date of amount is
            spent on creation of the assets of which the possession has
            taken over by the State on enactment of the Ordinance and
            thereafter the Act. But the claim for interest prior to the
            appointed day could be agitated before a different forum,
            not before the Commission who has limited jurisdiction to
            direct payment of interest on the amount of compensation
            awarded only from the appointed day, i.e. 30-11-96, till
            payment is made. There is a clear exclusion under the Act
            itself for grant of interest   for the period prior to the
            appointed day. The Commission has committed an error in
            directing payment after calculation of the interest prior to
            appointed day."

<p id="p_10">17.      We are unable to accept this submission. The above
observation only relate to equitable principle under the common
law for claiming interest. The said observation do not hold that
the appellant had rights beyond the statute. It is clear from the
scheme of the Act that rights of the appellant were only as per the
Act and could be claimed only before the exclusive forum created
under the Act. This being the clear position, the suit filed before
the civil court was not maintainable as the jurisdiction of the civil
court was barred.
