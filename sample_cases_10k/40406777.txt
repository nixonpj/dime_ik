                                        JUDGMENT
</pre><p id="p_1">Antony Dominic, J.
</p>
<p id="p_2">      The petitioner in the writ petition is an Assistant Manager in the

service of the first respondent.              The post to which he can aspire for

promotion is that of Manager. In the Departmental Promotion Committee

that was held on 14.12.2011, having regard to the fact that petitioner is

accused No.3 in C.C.9/2009 in the Court of Enquiry Commissioner and

Special Judge, Kottayam, sealed cover procedure as provided in Note (i) to

Rule 28(b)7 of Part II K.S. and S.S.R. was adopted.

</p><p id="p_3">      2. It was thereupon, he filed the writ petition contending that in the

matter of his promotion to the post of Assistant Manager when his claims

were overlooked for this very reason, he approached this Court by filing

W.P.(C)2222/08 and that pursuant to directions contained in Ext.P1

judgment he was promoted. On this basis, he contended that applying the

principle laid down in Ext.P1 judgment, his claim for promotion to the post

of Manager should also be considered.
</p>
<p id="p_4">      3. In the writ petition, a counter affidavit was filed on behalf of

respondents 1 and 2, in which they inter alia produced Ext.R1(c), a

W.P.(C) No.5173 of 2012
                                    :  2 :
</p>
<p id="p_5">


judgment rendered by this Court in W.P.(C)35360/07. That was a case

filed by 6th accused in C.C.9/09 mentioned above. In that judgment, the

learned Single Judge had upheld the entitlement of the respondents to

adopt sealed cover procedure in the matter of promotion to the post of

Manager. Therefore, according to the respondents, the petitioner was

not entitled to the reliefs prayed for.
</p>
<p id="p_6">        4. When the writ petition came up for consideration before the

learned Single Judge of this Court, considering Exts.P1 and R1(c)

judgments mentioned above, the learned Single Judge passed order

dated 21st August 2012, doubting the correctness of Ext.P1 judgment in

Writ Petition 2222/08. It was accordingly that the writ petition is listed

before this bench.
</p>
<p id="p_7">        5.    We heard the counsel for the petitioner, learned Standinc

Counsel appearing for respondents 1 and 2 and the learned counsel

appearing for the party respondents.
</p>
<p id="p_8">        6.    Insofar as the correctness of Ext.P1 judgment in W.P.(C)

2222/08 is concerned, Ext.P1 judgment, as already stated, dealt with

the claim of the petitioner therein for promotion to the post of Assistant

W.P.(C) No.5173 of 2012
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                    : 3 :</span>




Manager. It is the admitted case of the parties that unlike the post of

Manager, the post of Assistant Manager is filled up merely on the basis

of seniority without subjecting the candidates to a process of selection

by a Departmental Promotion Committee. Therefore, the Rules that are

applied for promotion to the post of Assistant Manager is different from

the Rules which govern the promotion to the post of the Manager.

Therefore, the principles laid down in Ext.P1 judgment in W.P.(C)

2222/08 cannot have any relevance insofar as promotion to the post of

Manager is concerned. On the other hand, the promotion to the post of

Manager being selection post, the provisions of Rule 28(b)(i)(7) and the

Note attached thereto are applicable and it is taking note of this Rule

that Ext.R1(c) judgment was rendered. Therefore, since the Ext.P1

judgment and R1(c) judgment operate in different fields governing

promotions to the posts of Assistant Manager and Manager, we do not

think there is any need to doubt the correctness of Ext.P1 judgment

rendered in the context of promotion to the post of Assistant Manager.

</p><p id="p_9">        7. Turning to the merits of the claim raised in the writ petition, as

already stated by us claim of the petitioner is for promotion to the post

W.P.(C) No.5173 of 2012
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                      : 4 :</span>




of Manager. Admittedly, the post is a selection post and the provisions

of Rule 28(b)(i)(7) and the Note attached thereto are applicable. Note

</p><p id="p_10">(i), insofar as it relevant, reads thus:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">        "Officers against whom vigilance or departmental
        proceedings are taken after the charges have prima facie
        been established in a preliminary enquiry should not be
        included in the select list. But, the cases of such Officers
        should also be assessed. The question of including them
        in the select list shall be considered when the result of
        the enquiry is known. However, Officers against whom
        departmental proceedings are taken for the imposition
        of a minor penalty may be included in the select list
        provisionally if they are found suitable but for the
        pendency of disciplinary proceedings initiated against
        them."</blockquote><p id="p_11">

</p><p id="p_12">        8. Reading of the note, therefore, shows that the officers against

whom vigilance case is taken after the charges have prima facie been

established in a preliminary enquiry should not be included in the

select list and in their case sealed cover procedure is required to be

adopted. Insofar as this case is concerned, after a preliminary enquiry

charge was laid before the Court of Enquiry Commissioner and Special

Judge, Kottayam, which registered the case as C.C.9/09. The report

obtained from that Court shows that the petitioner was enlarged on bail

W.P.(C) No.5173 of 2012
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                       : 5 :</span>




on 13.3.2009 and copies of the final report (charge sheet) was also

served on him on that day itself.
</p>
<p id="p_13">        9.    These facts therefore shows that this is a case to which

undoubtedly the provisions of Note (i) of Rule 28(b)(i)(7), extracted

above, are attracted. Consequently, respondents 1 and 2 were perfectly

justified in adopting sealed cover procedure in the Departmental

Promotion Committee that was held on 14.12.2011. We, therefore, do

not find any reason to issue any of the directions sought for.

</p><p id="p_14">        Writ petition fails and it is accordingly dismissed.
