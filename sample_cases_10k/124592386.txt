rights. On an earlier occasion on 22.4.1977, the

Land Tribunal granted occupancy rights in favour

of the tenant, father of the respondent No.3. Writ

Petition No.14572/1979 was filed, wherein by the

order dated 10.7.1984, the order of the Land

Tribunal        was    set   aside    and   the    matter       was

remanded for fresh enquiry. After remand, by the

order         dated   20.7.1996,      the   Form        No.7    was

rejected.       The   tenant    questioned        the    same    in

W.P.No.22615/1996, wherein by the order dated

28.7.2000, the order was set aside and the matter

was remanded to the Land Tribunal for fresh

enquiry. By the impugned order, the Tribunal

granted tenancy rights to the respondent No.3.

Aggrieved by the same, the present petition is

filed.
</p>
<p id="p_3">
</p><p id="p_4">         2.     Sri S.S.Magadum, learned counsel for

the petitioner contends that the impugned order is

bad in law and liable to be set aside. That there is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                             :5:</span>


substantial material to show that the petitioner is

in possession of the land in question. That he

prayed to consider the material on record.


</p><p id="p_5">     3.     On    the   other   hand,   Sri   B.S.Kamate,

learned counsel for respondent No.3 defends the

impugned order. His first contention is that the

petitioner is the agreement holder. Therefore he

has no locus-standi to question the impugned

order. That the original landlord respondents 8 to

14   have   not    questioned     the   impugned    order

granting tenancy rights to the tenant. In fact they

have admitted the claim of the tenants. Further,

based on the agreement executed in favour of

ancestor of the petitioner, a suit was filed in

O.S.No.118/1960 for specific performance of the

said agreement of sale dated 12.7.1954. By the

order dated 30.1.1971, the suit was dismissed. In

the course of disposal of the suit, additional issue

No.2 to the effect as to whether the defendant
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                             :6:</span>


namely the ancestor of the 3 r d respondent proves

that she is the tenant of the suit land was held in

affirmative. Hence on this ground also the order of

the Land Tribunal is sustainable.


</p><p id="p_6">       4.    Heard learned counsels and examined

the records. On hearing learned counsels, I'am of

the considered view that there is no merit in this

writ petition. Firstly the question of the petitioner

challenging    the    impugned    order   of   the     Land

Tribunal does not arise for consideration. He is

not the landlord. He is holder of an agreement to

sale. Therefore he would have no locus-standi to

question the order of grant of occupancy rights to

the respondent No.3. Further seeking to enforce

his right, O.S.No.118/1960 was filed by him. That

suit   was   also    dismissed.   Hence   he   being    the

holder of the agreement of sale and therefore was

in possession of the land in question, in terms of

the agreement, also stands erased by the order of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                 :7:</span>


the     Land       Tribunal.   Further     more,    the      issue

therein as to whether the tenant is in possession

under        the    landlord       was   also    held   in    the

affirmative.         Under     these     circumstances        the

Tribunal       was     justified    in   granting   occupancy

rights to the 3 r d respondent. I do not find any

error committed by the Tribunal that calls for any

interference. All the records and the material are

heavily against the petitioner. There is no ground

to interfere.

of merit is dismissed.
