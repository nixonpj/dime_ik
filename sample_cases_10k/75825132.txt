 IN THE HIGH COURT OF JUDICATURE FOR RAJASTHAN
AT JAIPUR BENCH JAIPUR

S.B. Civil Writ Petition No.13915/2013
Hemraj Kushwah
Versus 
State of Rajasthan &amp; Anr.  
DATE OF ORDER      :       01/10/2013
HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE M.N. BHANDARI


Mr. Rajvir Sharma, for petitioner

***
</pre><p id="p_1">	The petitioner is aggrieved due to denial of compassionate appointment despite adoption deed in his favour and even succession certificate based on it. 
</p><p id="p_2">	The petitioner has not been taken as son of erstwhile deceased government servant. In view of the above, this court may direct the respondents to grant compassionate appointment to the petitioner by treating him to be adopted son. 
</p><p id="p_3">	I have considered the submission made by learned counsel for petitioner and perused the record.
</p><p id="p_4">	The adoption deed at Annexure-1 was executed in the month of January, 2008 when petitioner was at the age of 25 years as admitted by learned counsel for petitioner. The perusal of adoption deed does not show that as per custom, adoption is permissible even after age of 15 years. I am conscious about the fact that arrangement of adoption was agreed when petitioner was at the age of 5 years and petitioner was even adopted at that age. 
</p><p id="p_5">	Learned counsel for petitioner was asked about qualification certificate to find out whether name of adoptive father has been referred there or of natural father. Learned counsel is fair enough to state that throughout, name of natural father has been shown and not of adoptive father. In view of the above, if one has been adopted at the age of 5 years itself, name of his adoptive father should have been referred every where and not of natural father. In view of the above, adoption at the age of 5 years remains in the document executed in the year 2008. It could not be proved by other material. The age of petitioner is relevant as adoption deed was executed in the year 2008, whereas adoption is not legally permissible after the age of 15 years  unless custom so permits. The adoption deed does not show prevalent custom to permit adoption after 15 years or any other custom in the society to which petitioner belongs. In the background aforesaid, if respondents have denied to take cognizance of the adoption deed executed just before the death of erstwhile government servant, I do not find any illegality in the action of the respondents. 
</p><p id="p_6">	So far as succession certificate is concerned, if it is granted based on adoption deed, then it is without considering the fact that as to whether and when adoption deed can be executed and further if petitioner was taken in adoption at the age of 5 years, then why name of his natural father used throughout. All these aspects were relevant and this court cannot ignore it and accept it without scrutiny of the document as per the provisions of law. In view of the finding recorded, I do not find that a case is made out to claim compassionate appointment treating petitioner to be adopted son of the deceased. 
</p><p id="p_7">	In view of the discussion  made above, I do not find any merit in the writ petition. It is accordingly dismissed. Stay application is also dismissed.
