<pre id="pre_1">          HON'BLE SRI JUSTICE C. PRAVEEN KUMAR


            WRIT PETITION Nos. 38248 &amp; 38431 of 2018

COMMON ORDER:


1)    Since the issue involved in both the petitions is one and the same,

these writ petitions are disposed of by way of this common order.


2)    Heard learned counsel for the petitioners, learned Government

Pleader for Mines and Geology, learned Standing Counsel for

A.P.S.R.T.C, learned Government Pleader for Home and learned

Government Pleader for Revenue. With their consent, the writ petitions

are disposed of at the admission stage.


3)    The present writ petitions came to be filed seeking issuance of writ

of mandamus declaring the action of the respondents in seizing the</pre>

<p id="p_1">vehicles of the petitioners bearing Nos. AP-31-TE-0729 and AP-31-TD-

5556, without following procedure of law, as illegal and arbitrary.


</p><p id="p_2">4)    On the allegation that the subject vehicles were found transporting

sand from the unauthorized reaches/without any permission, during the

raid conducted, the officials of the Vigilance and Enforcement Wing of

Mines and Geology department seized the vehicles and handed over the

same to respondent No.4, to keep them in safe custody.


</p><p id="p_3">5)    In identical circumstance, in I.A.No.1 of 2018 in W.P.No.21809 of

2018, this Court passed an interim order on 16.07.2018, directing release

of vehicle on payment of amount and the petitioner therein carried the

matter in appeal, vide W.A.No.1014 of 2018, wherein a Division Bench
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                              2</span>


of this Court, by order dated 02.08.2018, disposed of the said Writ

Appeal, modifying the order, by directing release of vehicle upon the

appellant furnishing bank guarantee or security. A copy of the same is

placed on record. Paragraph Nos.5 to 8 of the said order reads as under:


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">               "5. From a perusal of sub-rule (1) of Rule 9-B, it is clear that if the
     appellants are found guilty of the offence, they are liable to pay a penalty of
     Rs.1,00,000/- apart from the confiscation of the vehicle and the imprisonment
     of the owner. In such circumstances, a via media has to be stuck, especially
     while considering an application for an interim order.       The learned Judge
     thought that directing payment of Rs.75,000/- per vehicle may be a good
     interim solution.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">               6. But the contention of the appellants is that ultimately if they are
     proved not guilty, the amount paid by them will remain with the respondents
     without bearing any interest.       The vehicles cannot also to be allowed to
     remain with the respondents, as they may get damaged due to non-use.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">               7. We think the objections of the appellants are fairly well founded.
     While the interests of the revenue are to be protected, the vehicles of the
     appellants cannot also be allowed to get damaged due to non-use. Therefore,
     we are of the view that directing the appellants to furnish bank guarantee or
     security for the above amount, may served the ends of justice.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">               8. Accordingly, the writ appeal is ordered modifying the order of the
     learned Judge, directing the respondents to release the tractors cum trailers of
     the appellants, upon the appellants furnishing bank guarantee or security to
     the tune of Rs.75,000 per vehicle, in favour of the 3rd respondent, viz., the
     Assistant Director of Mines and Geology.         There shall be no order as to
     costs".
</blockquote>
<p id="p_4">6)      Following the above said order, dated 02.08.2018, passed by a

Division Bench of this Court in W.A.No.1014 of 2018 and for the

reasons recorded therein, there shall be a direction to the respondents to

give interim custody of the vehicles bearing Nos. AP-31-TE-0729 and

AP-31-TD-5556 to the petitioners, subject to production of the relevant
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                       3</span>


documents, to prove ownership of the subject vehicles, and subject to

furnishing bank guarantee or security to a tune of Rs.1,00,000/-(rupees

one lakh only) per vehicle, in favour of respondent No.2.         Till the

conclusion of the proceedings/prosecution, petitioners shall also give an

undertaking that they will not alienate the vehicles, will not create any

third party rights, will not remove major parts of the vehicles and that

the vehicles will be produced as and when required during the course of

proceedings.    It is also made clear that this order holds good till the

conclusion of the proceedings/prosecution. Thereafter, it is open for the

respondents herein to proceed in accordance with law.


</p><p id="p_5">7)    With the above direction, the writ petitions are disposed of.


</p><p id="p_6">8)    Miscellaneous petitions, pending if any, shall stand closed in the

light of this final order. No order as to costs.
