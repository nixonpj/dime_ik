Station Sarai Rohilla and she had merely come to the Loco Shed to take 
her   pay.   He   further   stated   that   he   has   been   falsely   implicated   as   he 
refused to transfer complainant to Loco Shed from running room, Sarai 
Rohilla, despite her request.  Accused in order to support his contentions 
has examined Om Prakash who was posted as call man at Loco Shed at 
that time as DW1.

<p id="p_6">6              PW 1 Sumitra during her examination­in­chief has deposed 
that on 16.04.2007, she was working as Cook / RRB in the railway.  On the 
day of incident she was on duty at Loco office Railway Colony and came 
at 8 AM on her duty.   Accused called her in his office for marking her 
attendance   in   the   register.     When   she   reached   to   the   office,   accused 
started talking to her and told her that her mobile is out of order.   He 
caught her and tried to touch various parts of her body and further tried 
to touch his body with her body.   When she objected and told him that 
she is not such kind of woman and he should not touch her body, accused 
told her that if she allows him to do so, then she can come at any time in 
the office and can have fun with him. Thereafter, she pushed him and 
accused fell on the ground and she ran away from the spot.  She went to 
 FIR No. 175/07                              4/8                               21.09.2012



her duty cabin.  Accused also reached there and tried to offer Rs. 5,000/­ 
to her  and  further  threatened  her  that,  if  she  told  about  the  aforesaid 
incident to any one, then he would kill her.  She became frightened but 
some how came out of the Loco office and called the police.  She gave her 
statement Ex.PW1/A.  
</p>

<p id="p_7">7              She   in   her   cross­examination   admitted   that   her   duty   was 
from   8   AM   to   4   PM   and   she   never   used   to   put   her   attendance   mark 
anywhere for attending her duty.   She volunteered that accused Kaidar 
Nath himself put her attendance in the register.  On the day of incident, 
her duty was fixed by the accused in his office, otherwise she had duty at 
RRB in the running room of the railway station Sarai Rohilla.  The office of 
accused was in Loco Shed at railway station Sarai Rohilla and the walking 
distance between the running room and Loco Shed is about half an hour. 
She further admitted that 5­6 other employees of Railway including two 
ladies used to work in the office of accused at that time.  She used to go 
daily   to   the   office   of   accused   for   marking   her   attendance   first   and 
thereafter she used to resume her duty wherever she was told to do the 
same.  There was one peon in the office of accused but he was not present 
at   the   time   of   incident.   Further,   at   the   time   of   incident,   no   other 
employee or any other public person was present in the office of accused. 
She   further   admitted   that   she   reached   the   office   at   about   7:55   am   as 
about two days before the incident, the accused called her to come at 7:45 
AM in his office on 16.04.2007.   She admitted that she had told to the 
police  that accused  caught her  and  tried to touch  various parts of her 
body and further tried to touch his body with her body.

8             The   fact   that   the   attendance   of   class   IV   employees   was 
</pre><p id="p_8">marked by accused and complainant had gone to Loco Shed office on the 
said date is established from Ex.PW2/B and from the testimony of PW 3 
Spencer,   PW5   Naraian,   PW   7   Mathwar   Singh.       PW   3   Spencer,   PW5 
Naraian and PW 7 Mathwar Singh have  categorically  deposed  that the 
attendance of class IV employees was marked by the accused. It is further 
established     that   16.04.2007   was   the   pay   day   and   the   employees   have 
gone   to   Loco   Road,   Sarai   Rohilla   for   taking   their   pay.     PW3   has 
categorically deposed that when he reached to the office on 16.04.2007 for 
taking his pay, he saw that hot words were going on between the accused 
and   complainant   and   after   few   minutes   police   came   to   the   spot.     He 
heard that complainant and  accused were abusing each other.  PW 7  also 
deposed   that   when     complainant   came   at   Loco   Shed,   accused 
misbehaved   with   her   by   abusing   her   in   filthy   language.     Even   during 
cross­examination   he   admitted   that   filthy   abuses   were   given   by   the 
accused to the complainant in his presence but he denied of any physical 
misbehaviour by the accused with her.
</p>

<p id="p_9">9             Defence of the accused is that he has been falsely implicated 
by the complainant as she wanted to get herself transferred at Loco Shed 
and when he denied her many times for the same,  she falsely implicated 
him in the present matter.  He has examined DW1 in order to support his 
contentions.   DW1   in   his   examination   in   chief   has   deposed   that   on 
16.04.2009 Sumitra Devi came in the office of Loco Shed at around 9:30 
am . He was present in the office at that time.  Accused was also present in 
 FIR No. 175/07                           6/8                              21.09.2012



the   office   and   about   10­15   other   employees   were   also   present   there. 
Sumitra Devi came to take her pay as the pay was distributed in Loco 
Shed for the railway employees.   Sumitra Devi told Kaidar Nath to post 
her in Locoshed from Running Room Bera. Kaidar Nath refused to oblige 
her . Thereafter tu­tu mai­mai took place between them . After some time 
police came there. Thereafter he left for his duty to call Loco driver from 
the colony and later on came to know that police had taken Kaidar Nath 
from the office and case has been registered against him.   DW 1 in his 
testimony   has   merely   deposed   one   incident   when   the   complainant 
requested the accused to post her in Loco Shed.  No preceeding incident 
has   been   stated   by   DW   1   to   convince   that   complainant   has   falsely 
implicated the accused. It is unconvincing that mere refusal  to oblige her 
demand for transfer and that too once, complainant falsely implicated 
the accused. Further DW 1 admitted that duty was assigned at 8:00 am 
and the same used to be assigned by Kaidar Nath. Case of prosecution is 
that the incident took place at around 8:30 am in the morning. It is not the 
defence that complainant did not report in the morning on the date of 
incident and had only come at around 9:30 am.  Admittedly, complainant 
used to go daily to the office of accused for marking her attendance first 
and thereafter she used to resume her duty wherever she was told to do 
the same.   Hence, the deposition of DW1 to the extent that she had come 
only to take pay at around 9.30 am also does not repose much confidence. 
The incident as per case of the prosecution and complainant happened at 
around 8.20 am .   The duty of the complainant was from 8 am to 4 pm. 
Moreover, in the entire cross examination by the complainant, there is no 
suggestion   regarding   the   request   of   the   complainant   for   any   sort   of 
 FIR No. 175/07                               7/8                                 21.09.2012



transfer to the  accused and his consequent refusal to comply with the 
said request.   The said defence has been taken by accused for the first 
time in his statement u/s 313 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_7">Cr.PC</a>. Hence,  I am of the view that defence 
put forth by the accused does not repose any confidence.

<p id="p_10">11               The   ultimate   test   to   ascertain   whether   modesty   has   been 
outraged, is whether, the action of offender is such as can be perceived , 
as one which is capable of shocking sense of decency of a woman.  When 
the   said   test   is   applied   in   the   present   case,     PW   1   Sumitra   has 
categorically   deposed   that   accused   Kaidar   Nath   tried   to   touch   various 
parts of her body and tried to touch his body with her body. He further 
told her,   if she allowed him to do so, she can come at any time in the 
office and can have fun with him.  He not only stopped there but  as when 
the complainant pushed him, he went to her duty cabin and tried to offer 
Rs.   5,000/­   to   her.       The   contradictions   pointed   out   by   Ld.   Defence 
counsel about non use of  exact words as stated in initial complaint does 
not   goes   to   the   root   of   the   case   of   prosecution.       No   person   can   be 
expected   to   depose   in   verbatim   or   even   express     specific   words   .   The 
woman's reaction is most relevant in deciding the question of guilt.  The 
complainant immediately reported to the police without any delay as is 
evident from DD No. 14A and 18 and FIR Ex. PW 4/A . Accused has failed 
to prove   the   motive  of  his  false   implication.     PW1     has  deposed     the 
contents of her initial complaint in substratum and has stood the test of 
cross   examination.     On   the   basis   of   evidence   on   record,   I   am   of   the 
considered opinion  that prosecution has established its case against the 
accused   for   the   offence   U/s.  354   <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_8">IPC</a>     beyond   the   pales   of  reasonable 
 FIR No. 175/07                        8/8                           21.09.2012



doubt. Accused is thus convicted for the offence U/s. 354 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_9">IPC</a>.

<p id="p_11">12           As   regards   the   offence   U/s.   506   <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_10">IPC</a>   is   concerned, 
complainant has failed to show how the accused criminally intimidated 
her to cause threat in her mind in order to attract the offence U/s. 506 
<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_11">IPC</a>.  PW 1  has merely stated that accused threatened her that he would 
kill her if she complained regarding the same to anyone else. In my view, 
said   act   does   not   tantamount   to   criminal   intimidation   which   is 
punishable U/s. 506 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_12">IPC</a>. In the absence of any cogent evidence against 
the accused, accused is acquitted for the offence u/s. 506 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_13">IPC</a>.
