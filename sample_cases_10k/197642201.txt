Ex.PW1/8                              Copy of the letter dated 08.10.2008


</pre><p id="p_8">5.                 I have gone through the record and have heard the arguments of
the plaintiff. This is a suit duly instituted by the attorney of the plaintiff bank
Sh.Anurodh Julious whose Power of Attorney is filed on record as Ex.PW1/7.
</p>

<p id="p_9">6.                 It is the case of the plaintiff that the plaintiff had granted a loan of
Rs.3,10,600/- to the defendant for purchase of car namely SANTRO/XL. The
Credit Facility Application Form has been proved as Ex.PW1/1 vide which
the said loan was granted. The said form bears the signatures of defendant.
The agreement clearly stipulates that the defendant shall pay back the loan to
the plaintiff in 59 EMIs of Rs.7,152/- each starting from 05.12.2006. The
plaintiff has also filed on record statement of account of the defendant
Ex.PW1/4 from 05.12.2006 to 06.10.2008 stating that the                           statement of

plaintiff had issued a demand notice Ex.PW1/5 on 11.9.2008 for the payment
of the loan to the defendant alongwith postal receipt which is Ex.PW1/6.
</p>

<p id="p_10">7.                 In view of the above said circumstances, as the plaintiff
has been successful in showing that a loan for Rs.3,10,600/- was given by it to
the defendant and that the defendant had not paid the due installments to the
plaintiff bank, the plaintiff is held to be entitled to a decree of Rs.2,70,491/-.
The plaintiff has also claimed pendentilite and future interest @ 24% which
is exorbitant in the opinion of the court. However, simple interest @ 9% p.a
is awarded to the plaintiff from the date of filing of the suit till date of
realization.
