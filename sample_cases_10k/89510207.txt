SSL. Together with the said suit, SSL filed an application
under Order XXXIX Rule 1 and 2 CPC inter-alia stating therein
that IPL be restrained from unloading the cargo which
remained to be unloaded from the vessel for the reason IPL
had terminated the services of SSL without ascertaining the

works out to US$274,154.16. The appellant is also liable to
pay interest 24% per annum on the demurrage charges which
works out to US$150,967.55.

<p id="p_13"> 13.   In its reply filed, the appellant admitted that the
discharge of cargo from the vessel could not be completed
within the prescribed period. However, it denied its liability to
pay demurrage charges to the respondent for said delay on
the grounds that: - (i) in terms of clause XI of the contract
between the parties, the appellant is liable to pay demurrage
charges to the respondent only when demurrage results from
negligence or default on part of the buyer i.e. the respondent
and its agents, which was not the position in the present case
inasmuch as demurrage had not resulted from any negligence
or default on part of the appellant and its agents but was
caused due to the restraint imposed upon IPL by the courts at
Chennai from discharging the cargo from the vessel; (ii) the
period of about 38 days during which the receiver IPL was
restrained from discharging the cargo from the vessel would
not be counted towards lay time for the said period would fall
under ‗Force Majeure' clause in the contract between the
parties inasmuch as restraint imposed upon IPL by the courts
at Chennai from discharging the cargo from the vessel
tantamount to ‗acts of Government' and (iii) the appellant is
liable to pay demurrage charges to the respondent only when
same are payable by the respondent to the owner of the
vessel, which was not the position in the present case. In
terms of clause 4 of the charter party agreement entered
between the respondent and the owner of the vessel, the
period during which restraints are imposed by the established
authorities upon the discharging of the cargo from the vessel
cannot be counted towards lay time and therefore the

 respondent is not liable to pay any demurrage charges to the
owner of the vessel for the period during which IPL was
restrained by the courts at Chennai from discharging the
cargo from the vessel. In addition to its reply, the appellant
filed a counter claim before the Arbitral Tribunal claiming a
sum of `11,53,405/- paid by receiver IPL as ousting priority
charges for the purpose of allotment of a berth to the vessel.
</p><p id="p_14">14.   While the matter was pending adjudication before the
Arbitral Tribunal, the owner of the vessel invoked the
arbitration contained in charter party agreement between the
respondent and owner of the vessel and filed a claim petition
before an Arbitral Tribunal in London claiming amongst other
sums, a sum of US$233,368.06 from the respondent as
demurrage resulting from delay in discharging the cargo from
the vessel. Significantly, save and except contention relating
to force majeure clause same contentions, as were raised by
the appellant in the reply filed by it before the Arbitral
Tribunal in the present matter, were advanced by the
respondent before the Arbitral Tribunal in London in order to
deny payment of demurrage to the owner of the vessel. In
addition thereto, it was contended by the respondent that in
view of clause 26 of the charter party agreement which
prescribes that the charterer shall not be liable for any loss or
damage resulting from the negligence or default of the
stevedores and the fact that delay in discharging the cargo
from the vessel had occurred due to inefficiency of the
Stevedores SSL employed by receiver IPL, it is not liable to
pay any demurrage to the owner of the vessel.

<blockquote id="blockquote_23">      22. On 13th August the stevedores blamed the
      slow discharge rate upon the inadequacy of the

      The Charterers then placed the Owners on notice
      and held them responsible for all claims arising
      from problems with the gear. The Owners denied
      the allegations, stating that the Vessel and her
      cargo gear were fully certified by her Classification
      Society. We found that the stevedores' complaints
      were unfounded.

       discharge the Vessel (Sea-Shore Logistics) had
      lacked the financial resources to ensure a smooth
      and speedy progress of the operation. This
      appeared to us to be the most likely explanation for
      the clearly unsatisfactory performance of the
      discharging operations that led to the removal of
      the Vessel from the berth on 24th August.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_26">      26. As we shall see, the replacement of the
      stevedores initially appointed brought about other
      problems, but for the time being we will
      concentrate upon the period 12th to 17th August
      during which the Vessel was removed from the
      discharging     berth. The Charterers relied upon
      clauses 4 and 26 of the Charter-party, which, they
      said, interrupted the running of lay-time during the
      period in question.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_27">      27. So far as clause 4 is concerned, the Charterers
      relied upon ‗...shortage of ....trucks', and ‗restraints
      of established authorities', as well as general
      wording relating to ‗any other causes arising
      happening without fault of the Charterers...' It is in
      our view quite clear that, in respect of all the
      exceptions to lay-time covered by clause 4, lack of
      fault attributable to the Charterers is a necessary
      requirement. Therefore, as we are considering
      possible exceptions to the running of lay-time, it
      was for the Charterers to bring themselves within
      them.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_28">      28. The interruption to discharge following the
      Vessel's removal from the berth on 12th August had
      as an immediate cause the intervention (or
      ‗restraint') of an established authority, but the
      question we still had to answer was whether this
      intervention had come about without fault on the
      Charterer's part. Ignoring for the moment any
      possible impact of clause 26 upon this question, our
      view of evidence favored the Owners.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">FAO(OS)-501/2007                                 Page 12 of 27</span>
<blockquote id="blockquote_29">       29. The most specific complaint made by the
      Charterers related to an alleged shortage of trucks
      for which, they said, they were not responsible. The
      Owners took issue with this, stating that the slow
      rate of discharge (which had caused the authorities
      to act) had been due to the stevedores' failure to
      employ sufficient gangs to work the Vessel and
      sufficient trucks to remove the cargo discharged.
      The Owners submitted that there was no shortage
      of trucks at the port, and that the stevedore's poor
      performance was due to their poor financial status,
      which, among other things led to their failure to pay
      the required labour dues. The Receivers, the
      Owners said, were themselves dissatisfied with the
      performance of the stevedores, and in their letter of
      20th August, to which we have referred, they had
      spoken of this.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_30">      30. Whether or not the underlying problem was
      financial, we are satisfied that the slow rate of
      discharge achieved by Sea-Shore Logistics was due
      to their failure to engage sufficient trucks and
      labour. There was, we find, no shortage of either at
      Chennai at the time, which could not have been
      avoided by proper management, and we note that
      the replacement stevedoring company successfully
      increased the rate of discharge. It would be
      nonsensical to conclude that an avoidable shortage
      fell within clause 4 of the Charter-party. On the
      facts, the Charterers' reliance upon the specific
      exception ‗shortage of trucks' was, therefore,
      misplaced, regardless of whether or not the
      Charterers were generally responsible for the
      stevedores' conduct, a matter to which we will refer
      below.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_31">      31. Similarly, while the removal of the Vessel from
      the berth may be said to have stemmed from the
      restraint of an established authority, that restraint
      was imposed only because of the stevedores'
      shortcomings, and the essence of what we have
      said in the preceding paragraph applies here also.
</blockquote>


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">FAO(OS)-501/2007                                  Page 13 of 27</span>
<blockquote id="blockquote_32">       32. As we noted previously, the requirement of
      lack of fault attributable to the Charterers is an
      essential feature of successful reliance upon clause
      4 of the Charter-party. Under the Charter-party, it
      was Charterers' own responsibility to discharge the
      Vessel, and to do so within the permitted lay-time,
      and if it was because of the inadequacies of those
      who actually did the work on the Charterers' behalf
      that this target was not met, then at first sight the
      Charterers' would appear unable to demonstrate a
      lack of fault attributable to them. However, the
      Charterers suggested that an escape from such an
      obvious conclusion lay open to them, which they
      said was to be found in clause 26 of the Charter-
      party.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_33">      33. Clause      26    was    undoubtedly      broadly
      expressed, but we do not think it provides the
      protection that the Charterers seek. It is a matter of
      common sense and commercial reality, and, we
      believe, reasonably plain as a matter of
      construction. If clause 26 were to be taken as
      having effect that the Charterers suggest, there
      would seem to us to be very little point in having a
      lay-time and demurrage regime in the Charter-party
      at all. In our view, clause 26 is quite reasonably
      concerned with the potential vicarious liability for
      loss or damage caused to third parties (which for
      the present purposes might include the Owners) by
      those to whom the clause refers. We do not
      consider that this provision has any part
      whatsoever to play in connection with the Charter-
      party's distinct lay-time and demurrage regime,
      neither affecting the counting of time, nor the
      Charterers' obligation for time used beyond that
      allowed. We do not overlook that a claim to be paid
      demurrage may be characterized as a claim for
      liquidated damages for detention, but the code
      under which demurrage might become payable
      remained quite distinct from other provisions of the
      Charter-party, and, of course, contained its own



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">FAO(OS)-501/2007                                   Page 14 of 27</span>
       exceptions which, in appropriate circumstances,
      might have relieved the Charterers from that
      liability. Only by the use of very clear language- not
      present here- would we have been persuaded that
      an exceptions clause not explicitly directed towards
      lay-time was to be applied to the lay-
      time/demurrage code. Time therefore continued to
      count towards lay-time (in accordance with the
      provisions of the Charter-party) during the period at
      which we have been looking in this section.

      these Reasons, discharge was again interrupted on
      24th August, and the Vessel was removed from the
      berth, after Sea-Shore Logistics had obtained an
      injunction for the Court at Chennai preventing
      dealing with the cargo. At this time only about
      3,000 MT of cargo remained on board. The
      injunction was lifted briefly enabling some work to
      be carried out on 8th September, but Sea-Shore
      Logistics then obtained a further injunction, which
      was not ultimately lifted until 2nd October. The
      Charterers submitted that the lengthy delays that
      were result of these injunctions were not for their
      account, being excepted from lay-time under clause

      we have already said in paragraph 33, above.
      Although technical in nature, and possibly for this
      reason less appealing, one additional argument can
      be made in the Owners' favor in connection with
      the matter with which we are now dealing. So it
      could be said that, as they had previously been

      injunction that they did obtain, Sea-Shore Logistics
      were not then within the scope of clause 26 at all.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_38">      36. In the context of interruptions with which we
      are immediately concerned, we found the question
      of the applicability of clause 4 a less easy one to
      answer. Although it is, we accept, a matter of
      impression, we have nonetheless reached the
      conclusion that the specific exception ―restraints of
      established authorities‖ is not intended to embrace
      the assistance that may be given (and was given in
      the present case) by a court merely by way of
      injunction in civil proceedings relating to the sort of
      commercial dispute in which Sea-Shore Logistics
      had taken action. On the other hand we can
      imagine circumstances in which an injunction
      imposed by an competent court in such
      proceedings fell within the general exception,
      provided, of course, that its imposition, and its
      consequences had arisen without fault attributable
      to the Charterers.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_39">      37. In the present case, Sea-Shore Logistics'
      objective in bringing proceedings against the
      Receivers and others was to ensure payment to
      them of what they said they were entitled to for the
      operations taken by them prior to their replacement
      as stevedores. The immediate aim of the injunction
      appears to have been to prevent any movement of
      the cargo either remaining on the Vessel or
      removed to the godowns so that the quantity in
      respect of which they claimed entitlement to
      payment could be ascertained. So far as the
      Owners were concerned, the cargo was being dealt
      with on free in and out terms, and the question of
      what was due to the former stevedores should have
      been of no concern to them. They and the vessel
      were, as they said, innocent pawns in the
      contractual disputes of the others. Although Sea-
      Shore Logistics' actions seem to have been
      principally directed against the Receivers, under



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">FAO(OS)-501/2007                                   Page 16 of 27</span>
       the Charter-party it was Charterers' responsibility to
      ensure the discharge of the Vessel, and the essence
      of the Owners' case was that it was for the
      Charterers to do whatever appeared necessary to
      ensure that the Vessel was discharged. The
      Charterers could not, as it were, hide behind the
      Receivers in order to escape from their own
      obligations. We agree with this analysis. In practical
      terms, we consider that it was incumbent upon the
      Charterers to deal with the situation to which the
      grant of an injunction had given rise, seeking to
      have it lifted either by making a payment to the
      former stevedores, or by the provision of security of
      their claim. Instead, it appeared to us, the
      Charterers were more concerned to pursue their
      own arguments with the Receivers rather than
      taking steps to ensure the removal from the Vessel
      of the small quantity of cargo remaining on board at
      the material time. Although it is not for us to say, it
      may be that the Receivers should have done more
      than what they did, but that was no concern to the
      Owners. As we have previously held, it was for the
      Charterers to bring themselves within the
      protection of clause 4 of the Charter-party. On the
      evidence before us we are not satisfied that any of
      the loss of time suffered after 6:00 hours on 24 th
      August as a result of the injunctions obtained by
      Sea-Shore Logistics happened without the fault on
      the Charterers' part.‖          (Emphasis Supplied)

cannot interdict the award under <a href="/doc/1722761/" id="a_5">Section 34</a> of the Arbitration
and <a href="/doc/1306164/" id="a_6">Conciliation Act</a>, 1996. In the instant case, after
interpreting clause XIX of the contract between the parties
and Clause 4 of the Charter Party agreement the view taken
by the Arbitral Tribunal to that period during which IPL was
restrained by the Courts at Chennai from discharging the
cargo from the vessel is a correct view when seen in the
backdrop of the fundamental principle of law that an
injunction granted by the Court should not cause any injury to
any person.
</p><p id="p_22">B)    While rejecting the interpretation given by the Arbitral
Tribunal to Force Majeure clause (clause XIX) contained in the
contract between the parties the learned Single Judge failed
to appreciate that ‗Force Majeure' is a term of wide import.
Where reference is made to ‗Force Majeure', the intention is
to save the performing party from the consequences of
anything over which he has no control. In the instant case,
the appellant had no control over the injunction(s) granted by

 the   Courts       at   Chennai   restraining   receiver   IPL    from
discharging the cargo from the vessel and in this view of the
matter it was rightly held by the Arbitral Tribunal that period
during which IPL was restrained by the Courts at Chennai
from discharging the cargo from the vessel should not be
counted towards lay time, particularly when receiver IPL had
vigilantly opposed the various petitions/applications filed by
SSL in various courts at Chennai and got vacated the orders
of injunction granted by the courts in favor of SSL on various
occasions.
</p><p id="p_23">18.   The basic facts of the matter are not in dispute. It is not
in dispute that the vessel remained in the anchorage for a
considerable period after arriving at the discharging port. The
vessel firstly remained in the anchorage for a period from
12.08.1999 to 17.08.1999 when port authorities ordered the
shifting of the vessel to the anchorage on account of failure of
stevedores SSL to maintain the minimum discharge rate
prescribed by the port authorities. The vessel has thereafter
remained at the anchorage for the period from 24.08.1999 to
06.10.1999 due to the orders passed by the courts at Chennai
restraining receiver IPL from discharging the cargo from the
vessel. The appellant has denied its liability to pay demurrage
to the respondent when the vessel remained in the anchorage
from 24.08.1999 to 06.10.1999.
</p><p id="p_24">19.   The first question which has arisen in the present appeal
is that whether the restraint imposed upon receiver IPL by the
courts at Chennai from discharging the cargo from the vessel




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">FAO(OS)-501/2007                                       Page 22 of 27</span>
 falls under the Force Majeure clause (clause XIX) contained in
the contract between the parties.
</p><p id="p_25">20.   We have already reproduced the Force Majeure clause
(clause XIX) contained in the contract between the parties in
para 1 above. Be it noted here that there is no reference to
the ‗acts of Courts' in the said clause.
</p><p id="p_26">21.   The term ‗Force Majeure' was considered in great detail
by    the   Supreme   Court    in   the    decision   reported        as
Dhanrajamal Gobindram v Shamji Kalidas &amp; Co AIR 1961 SC
1285 wherein it was stated as under:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_40">      ―McCardie J. in Lebeaupin v. Crispin [1920] 2 K.B.
      714, has given an account of what is meant by
      ‗force majeure' with reference to its history. The
      expression ‗force majeure' is not a mere French
      version of the Latin expression ‗vis major'. It is
      undoubtedly a term of wider import. Difficulties
      have arisen in the past as to what could
      legitimately be included in ‗force majeure'. Judges
      have agreed that strikes, breakdown of machinery,
      which, though normally not included in ‗vis major'
      are included in ‗force majeure'. An analysis of
      rulings on the subject into which it is not necessary
      in this case to go, shows that where reference is
      made to ‗force majeure', the intention is to save the
      performing party from the consequences of
      anything over which he has no control. This is the
      widest meaning that can be given to ‗force
      majeure', and even if this be the meaning, it is
      obvious that the condition about ‗force majeure' in
      the agreement was not vague....‖
                                          (Emphasis Supplied)

</blockquote><p id="p_27">22.   From the aforesaid, it is clear that the appellant can
take recourse to Force Majeure clause contained in the
contract between the parties only if is able to show that the
happening of events of restraints imposed upon IPL by the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">FAO(OS)-501/2007                                      Page 23 of 27</span>
 courts at Chennai from discharging the cargo from the vessel
was beyond the control of the appellant.
</p><p id="p_28">23.   In the instant case, the appellant had appointed IPL as
receivers for the purposes of handling of cargo which in turn
engaged the services of SSL as stevedores. It is not in dispute
that the performance of SSL was poor inasmuch as it was not
able to maintain the minimum discharge rate prescribed by
the port authorities due to which reason the port authorities
ordered the shifting of the vessel to the anchorage on
12.08.1999. The vessel returned to the discharge berth on
17.08.1999. However the performance of SSL did not improve
and it was still not able to maintain the minimum discharge
rate prescribed by the port authorities due to which reason
IPL terminated the services of IPL on 20.08.1999 and
appointed another stevedores M/s.Express Clearing Agency in
its place. Before terminating the services of SSL IPL neither
ascertained the quantity of cargo unloaded by SSL nor settled
the accounts of SSL which constrained SSL to take recourse to
the court(s) and obtain injunction(s) restraining IPL from
discharging the cargo from the vessel. The appellant and
receiver IPL could have avoided the situation of restraints
being imposed upon by IPL by the courts at Chennai by
ascertaining the quantity of cargo unloaded by SSL and
settling the accounts of SSL before terminating the services of
SSL. Such being the position, the happening of events of
restraints imposed upon IPL by the courts at Chennai from
discharging the cargo from the vessel was not beyond the
control of the appellant and consequently the appellant take



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">FAO(OS)-501/2007                                 Page 24 of 27</span>
 shelter of Force Majeure clause contained in the contract
between the parties to avoid payment of demurrage to the
respondent caused by happening of the said events.
</p><p id="p_29">24.   It has next been contended by the appellant that the
period during which IPL was restrained by the courts at
Chennai from discharging the cargo from the vessel cannot
be counted towards lay time in view of clause 4 of the Charter
Party which prescribe that periods during which restraints are
imposed by the established authorities upon discharging of
the cargo are not to be counted towards lay time.
</p><p id="p_30">25.   For the sake of convenience, we again reproduce Clause
4 of the Charter Party agreement:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_41">      ―4. Any of the following causes are excepted,
      regardless of where they occur: strikes or lockouts
      at Shippers' or Suppliers' mines or factory, on
      railways, trucks or barges, or at the ports of loading
      or discharging; war or effects of war; revolution;
      civil commotion; breakdown or on stoppage or
      shortage     of   railways,    trucks   or     barges;
      interruptions, stoppage or breakdowns at the factor
      of the Shippers' or the Suppliers' or the Suppliers'
      now or hereafter under contract; stoppage or
      destruction of goods in transit; epidemic; fire; frost,
      cyclones, storms, floods, earthquakes, unavoidable
      accidents to machinery or equipment, or other
      unavoidable hindrances or delay in mining,
      manufacturing, transporting, loading, discharging or
      receiving the material or goods; restraints of
      established authorities; any delay caused by the
      Vessel, Master or crew; and any other causes
      whatsoever or howsoever arising happening without
      the fault of the Charterers preventing or delaying
      the    mining     or    manufacturing,      supplying,
      transporting, loading or discharging or receiving of
      the cargo. Charterers shall not be liable for any loss
      or damage resulting from any such excepted



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">FAO(OS)-501/2007                                   Page 25 of 27</span>
       causes and time lost by reason thereof shall not
      count as used laytime or time on demurrage, unless
      vessel already on demurrage.‖ (Emphasis Supplied)
</blockquote><p id="p_31">26.    A bare reading of clause 4 brings out that charterer is
not liable to pay for any loss or damage caused by the events
which occurred without the fault of the charterer and that the
time lost due to occurrence of such events is not to be
counted towards lay time. We have already held in preceding
paragraphs that situation of restraints being imposed upon
IPL by the courts at Chennai from discharging the cargo from
the vessel was brought about by the fault of the appellant and
IPL of not ascertaining the cargo unloaded by the SSL and
settling the accounts of SSL before terminating the services of
SSL. In such circumstances, it cannot be said that the events
of restraints being imposed upon IPL by the courts at Chennai
had happened without any fault of the charterer i.e. the
respondent inasmuch as the respondent was liable to make
payment to the owner of the vessel for any demurrage
caused due to the actions of the buyer i.e. the appellant and
its nominees. It is also worth mentioning here that the Arbitral
Tribunal in London had repelled the contention predicated
upon Clause 4 of the Charter Party agreement raised before it
by the respondent. We thus concur with the view taken by the
learned Single Judge that clause 4 of the Charter Party
agreement has no application in the present case.
</p><p id="p_32">27.   The matter can also be looked at from another angle.
The Arbitral Tribunal in London had directed the respondent
to pay demurrage to the owner of the vessel caused during
the period when IPL was restrained by the courts at Chennai



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">FAO(OS)-501/2007                                  Page 26 of 27</span>
 from discharging the cargo from the vessel. The fault for said
restraint being imposed upon IPL lies with the appellant and
IPL. The respondent which is an innocent party cannot be
made to suffer for the faults of the appellant. Thus, the
appellant is bound to make payment of demurrage to the
respondent which is payable by the respondent to the owner
of the vessel in terms of the award passed by the Arbitral
Tribunal in London.
</p><p id="p_33">28.   In view of the above discussion, the appeal is dismissed
and the impugned judgment dated 10.10.2007 passed by the
learned Single Judge is upheld.
