                      Judicial Magistrate, Thiruvottiyur, dated 03.10.2017, rejecting

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                                      2</span>

                      the claim of the petitioner for grant of interim custody of the

                      amount of Rs.3,66,000/- which was seized by the respondent

                      police in a case in Crime No.132 of 2017.
</p>
<p id="p_2">

</p><p id="p_3">                           2. The petitioner herein is the defacto complainant in

                      Crime No.132 of 2017, who lodged a complaint against one

                      Kannan and others, alleging that they had committed breach of

                      trust, cheating and robbery. Based on the complaint, a case in

                      Crime No.132 of 2017 was registered by the respondent police

                      against the said Kannan and others for the offences punishable

                      under <a href="/doc/664789/" id="a_3">Sections 406</a>, <a href="/doc/1099980/" id="a_4">420</a>, <a href="/doc/1457888/" id="a_5">397</a> r/w 506(ii) <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_6">IPC</a>. It is the case of

                      the defact complainant that the accused Kannan approached him

                      to redeem the jewels which were pledged by the family members

                      of the accused in Maliyakollai Thodakka Velanmai Co-operative

                      Bank Ltd., Valliyanallur, Mayiladudurai taluk, Mayavaram. The

                      petitioner arranged a sum of Rs.18,00,000/-.      The accused

                      Kannan and others, after taking the    petitioner and his family

                      members, had grabbed the amount of Rs.18,00,000/-. It appears

                      that after registering the case, the respondent police arrested

                      two accused persons and recovered a sum of Rs.3,66,000/-.

                      Therefore, the petitioner moved a petition before the Court

http://www.judis.nic.in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                                      3</span>

                      below, seeking return of the seized amount as interim custody to

                      him, as according to the petitioner, the amount was belonging

                      him.   Likewise, the accused Kannan also moved a petition for

                      return of the seized amount to him as interim custody claiming

                      that the seized amount belongs to him.
</p>
<p id="p_4">

</p><p id="p_5">                             3. The learned Judicial Magistrate, after adverting to the

                      submissions made both on behalf of the petitioner, namely,

                      defacto complainant and the accused, has rejected the claim for

                      the reasons that the accused Kannan had also filed a petition in

                      C.M.P.No.1734 of 2017 for interim custody of the amount of

                      Rs.3,66,000/-, claiming that the amount belongs to him. In view

                      of rival claims as between the defacto complainant and the

                      accused, the learned Judicial Magistrate has rejected claim of

                      the petitioner herein since the rival claims as between the

                      petitioner and the accused would be decided only at the

                      conclusion of the trial.
</p>
<p id="p_6">

</p><p id="p_7">                             4. This Court has gone through the order passed by the

                      learned Judicial Magistrate and perused the relevant records.



http://www.judis.nic.in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                                      4</span>



</p><p id="p_8">                            5. This Court does not see any infirmity in the order passed

                      by the learned Judicial Magistrate since there appears to be rival

                      claims as to the money recovered by the police to the tune of

                      Rs.3,66,000/-. Once there appears to be rival claim to the money

                      involved, the Court below could not take a decision one way or

                      the other for return of the money to one of the parties and

                      therefore, rejected the claim of the petitioner stating that the

                      matter could be concluded only in the trial. Therefore, this Court

                      does not find anything wrong in the order passed by the learned

                      Judicial Magistrate.
</p>
<p id="p_9">

</p><p id="p_10">                            6. Accordingly, the Crl.Revision Case fails and the same is

                      dismissed as devoid of merit.
