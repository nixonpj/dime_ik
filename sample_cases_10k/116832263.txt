     For the Respondents:
</p><p id="p_11">                            ......
</p><p id="p_12">02/ Dated: 18.12.2019
           The appellant, National Insurance Co.Ltd has preferred this          appeal
    against the award dated 18.9.2018 passed in M.A Claim Case No. 41 of 2016 by
    the learned Principal District Judge-cum-Presiding Officer, M.A.C.T, Dhanbad
    whereby the learned Tribunal has awarded compensation in favour of             the
    claimants to the tune of Rs.8,57,500/- to be paid within two months. If the
    Insurance Company fails to satisfy the award the claimants will be at liberty to
    realize the compensation amount from the Insurance Company through the
    process of the Court with 6% future interest.
</p><p id="p_13">           The learned counsel for the appellants has submitted that there is a delay
    of 72 days in preferring this appeal and for condonation of the same, I.A No.2830
    of 2019 has been filed under <a href="/doc/100581/" id="a_1">section 5</a> of the Limitation Act.
</p><p id="p_14">           The learned counsel for the appellant has further submitted that another I.A
    No. 2831 of 2019 has been filed under order XLI Rule 5(5) of the Code of Civil
    Procedure 1908 for staying the proceeding in Execution Case being Execution
    Case No.3 of 2019 pending in the court of learned Principal District Judge-cum-
    Presiding Officer, Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Dhanbad in M.A Claim Case
    No. 41 of 2016.
</p><p id="p_15">           The learned counsel for the appellant has assailed the impugned award on
    ground that apart from the claimants, two married daughters of the deceased
    namely, Namita Devi and Anita Devi, who are respondent nos.6 and 7 before this
    court and Proforma defendant nos.4 and 5 before the Claims Tribunal, have not
    given any share in the compensation amount, as such, there is a legal problem
    from the side of the National Insurance Co. Ltd.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                          -2-</span>
<p id="p_16">            The learned counsel for the appellants has fairly submitted that the
     Insurance Company has not assailed the impugned award on the ground of
     computation of the compensation amount.
</p><p id="p_17">            Be that as it may, the appellant has filed frivolous Misc. Appeal against
     award passed by the Tribunal as awarded against the National Insurance Company
     to pay the compensation to the claimants who are three in numbers. The learned
     Tribunal has not passed any order which adversely affects the Insurance Company
     as no appeal has been filed by the proforma defendant nos.4 and 5, who are the
     married daughters of the deceased. Now this court is sitting in appeal under <a href="/doc/785258/" id="a_2">M.V.
     Act</a> cannot adjudicate succession issues which has been frivolously raised by the
     National Insurance Company Ltd.
</p><p id="p_18">            Accordingly this appeal is dismissed     with direction to the   National
     Insurance Company to be cautious in filing such frivolous matter in future before
     this court, other wise heavy cost shall be imposed on the National Insurance
     Company.
</p><p id="p_19">            Both I.As as mentioned above are also dismissed.
</p>
