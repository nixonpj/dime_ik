       COMMERCIAL TAX REVISION NO. 1 OF 2017
M/s Hari Cargo Carrier   ........ Petitioner / Revisionist

                                        Versus

The Chief Commissioner of Commercial Tax and another.
                                              .......Respondents

Mr. Mohit Maulekhi, Advocate for the petitioner.
Mr. Pradeep Joshi, Standing Counsel for the State of Uttarakhand / respondents.


                                                                Dated: 05.10.2017
Coram:     Hon'ble K.M. Joseph, C.J.
           Hon'ble Alok Singh, J.
</pre><p id="p_1">K.M. Joseph, C.J. (Oral)

                Petitioner has purported to file this revision petition
under Section 55 of the Uttarakhand Value Added Tax Act, 2005
(hereinafter referred to as the Act). Petitioner calls in question the
order passed by the Tribunal.
</p>
<p id="p_2">2.              Briefly put, the case of the petitioner appears to be as
follows:
</p><p id="p_3">                Petitioner is a transporter registered under the Service
Tax Act.       It was entrusted with goods on behalf of the logistic
company and the same were being carried from Delhi and the goods
were to be delivered to various godowns of the logistic company. It is
while so, the vehicle was accosted by the officers and, apparently,
invoking powers under Section 48 of the Act, the goods were seized
and security was demanded for release of the goods. The appeal
carried before the Appellate Authority partly succeeded. In that, the
amount was reduced from 40 per cent to 20 percent. It is a further
Appeal before the Appellate Tribunal, which resulted in the order,
which is impugned in this case. By the impugned order, the Appellate
Tribunal has partly allowed the Appeal and demand is now for
`3,50,000/- and the amount is directed to be deposited in cash or by
way of demand draft. It is feeling aggrieved by the said order that the
petitioner is before us.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                     2</span>




<p id="p_4">3.           We heard Mr. Mohit Maulekhi, learned counsel for the
petitioner and Mr. Pradeep Joshi, learned Standing Counsel on behalf
of the respondents.
</p>
<p id="p_5">4.           The following questions of law has been framed in the
memo of revision:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">             "I.   Whether security can be demanded from the
             Transporter who is not covered by any of the provision of
             UK VAT Act, 2005, neither engaged in any
             "BUSINESS" as defined in 2(6), not a "DEALER" as
             defined in Section 2(11) of the UK VAT Act, 2005, but is
             a Cargo Service provider, registered under the Service
             Tax Act, under the head Courier Service Agency?
             II.   Whether the revisionist who is Cargo transport
             service provider can be subjected to demand of Security,
             when the name of the CONSIGNOR AND CONSIGNEE
             are disclosed and no provisions of UK VAT Act are
             applicable to it?"
</blockquote>
<p id="p_6">5.           Mr. Maulkehi, learned counsel for the petitioner
reiterates that the petitioner is only a transporter engaged by the
logistic company, which is registered under the provisions relating to
the Service Tax Act; the goods had been ordered by various
individuals online; the goods were being transported on behalf of the
logistic company and the goods have already suffered tax under the
Central Sales Tax and there is no liability to tax under the Act.     He
would also submit that under the proviso to Section 48, petitioner is
not mulcted with the liability to carry Form-16, which, undoubtedly,
the petitioner was not carrying at the time of the seizure of the goods.
</p><p id="p_7">6.           Per contra, learned Standing Counsel would point out
Rule 26 of the Uttarakhand VAT Rules, 2005 (hereinafter referred
to as the Rules). He would submit that the provisions of Rule 26
indicate that the transporter will also be comprehended within the
persons saddled with the liability to carry Form 16 declaration. He
would also harness provisions of Section 48(2) of the Act.
</p><p id="p_8">7.           Proceeding at this stage is only relating to the demand of
security as a condition for release of the seized goods.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                    3</span>




<p id="p_9">8.           In the nature of the case, we do not think that we should
go into the questions of law, which are raised. We have already
noticed that the Appellate Tribunal has already reduced the amount to
`3,50,000/- and in such circumstances, having heard the contentions
of the parties, we refuse to go into the questions of law raised and we
leave it open to the petitioner to pursue his contentions before the
Authority in the statutory proceedings. We, however, leave open the
questions of law, which are being raised by the petitioner, so that the
same can be canvassed, if necessary, at later stage. Subject to the
same, the revision petition will stand dismissed.
