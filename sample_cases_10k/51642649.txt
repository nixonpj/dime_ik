advertisement issued by the respondents for carrying

on the different posts under the MGNREGA Scheme.                                      The

petitioner initially came to be appointed as Data

Entry Operator subsequently as M.S. Coordinator in

Kutch district.             His initial appointment in the year

2010 was for temporary period of 11 months which,

however, came to be extended from time to time.
</p>

<p id="p_4">3.1 The       MGNREGA         Scheme       was          made     operative              in

accordance with the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1294999/" id="a_2">National Rural

Employment Guarantee Act</a>, 2005. The MGNREGA Scheme,

inter       alia,         contemplates            to     guarantee            minimum

employment for 100 days to the rural labourers, for

which necessary establishment has been created and

sanctioned by the Government of Gujarat through its

Panchayat Housing and Rural Development Department.

satisfies        these       requirements.              Another          resolution

dated     23.12.2013          relating         to       the    MGNREGA           Scheme

</pre><p id="p_6">provides that the State would continue the work under

the said Scheme and for new districts and talukas in

the State, additional new posts would also be filled

up. The resolution also says that all contractual

appointments made on the establishment of the MGNREGA

Scheme would be terminated at a particular point of

time. It appears that another Government Resolution

dated    14.08.2014          was     made     whereby         the      recruitment

programme for all the post was announced.

<p id="p_7">3.3     It is the case of hte petitioner herein that he

has been discharging duties of permanent nature. It

was submitted that though the work order initially

continues, but purely on contractual basis and
such employment shall be co­terminus with the
scheme,   subject   to   evaluation   of   their
performance, service and disciplinary rules as
may be made applicable to them. The respondent­
State shall insist on periodical upgradation of
knowledge, improvisation of technical skill and
overall preparedness on the subject, so also on
computerization.
</p>
<p id="p_11">52.2.   The    challenge   to   the   Government
Resolutions dated December 23, 2013 and August
28, 2014 and the consequential process of
recruitment undertaken in the year 2014 pursuant
to the public advertisement dated August 28,
2014, succeeds qua the petitioners only. Those
petitioner who have qualified in the last
examination of the year 2014 shall be continued
on contractual employment without insistence on
their fresh appointment by the respondent­State.

petitioners' contract of service on the same
terms and conditions as continued so far

examination and not qualified in the process of
recruitment of the year 2014, shall not be
discontinued, if already on contractual service
pursuant to their selection through legally
permissible mode in the years 2009 and 2011.

approached this Court after their termination on
account of non­extension of their contractual
employment, but otherwise given appointment
after selection under the Rules/ on following

    2014, in no manner, shall be affected by this
    judgment.
</p><p id="p_14">    52.6. It is being clarified that in absence of
    any policy of the State to grant permanency in
    any of the cadres at the District, Taluka or
    Gram Panchayat levels, the issue of the length
    of service of the petitioners deserves no
    adjudication. However, if any such policy in
    future is made by the State, the petitioners
    shall be at liberty to raise the contention of
    continuation and shall be entitled to raise the
    issue of the length of service from the date of
    their initial appointment. This Court has not
    concluded the said issue in the present group of
    petitions and has left the same for the
    petitioners to contend at an appropriate time in
    the future, if the occasion so arises.
    52.7. As a parting note, it is being observed
    that this Court would fail in its duty if it
    does not act as a catalyst in the words of the
    Apex Court and draws the attention of the State
    Government that if may need to take a policy
    decision in respect of creating permanent
    establishment where contractual appointments
    have continued for more than a decade and its
    continuation is still felt by gearing up at all
    levels.   Since  it   entails  large  financial
    implication, a marathon exercise is begging the
    attention of the State."

<p id="p_15">5.1 In     the      Letters   Patent         decision,      the       Division

Bench upheld the aforesaid directions to hold and

       of existing educational qualifications and work
       experience   of  each   of  the  employees  and
       readiness on their part to undergo any kind of
       training so as to improvisation of technical
       skill and overall preparedness on the subject,
       so also on computerisation.

       learned Single Judge in exercise of powers under
       <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_6">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India are in
       consonance with law laid down by the Apex Court,
       to which, reference is made in the decisions and
       it is trite that nature of employment namely
       contractual on which employee is serving is not
       to be replaced by another set of employees with
       same terms and conditions.
</p>
<p id="p_17">       9. Considering the object of the Act, 2005
       namely to provide employment in rural area by
       the Central Government and substantial cost to
       be incurred for and administrative side namely
       payment of wages and salary is to be borne by
       the Central Government under Rule 22 and State
       Government is fastened with the liability with
       the cost of unemployed allowances payable under
       the scheme and only 1/4th of the material cost
       of the scheme including payment of wages to
       skilled and semi­skilled workers subject to
       provisions of Schedule II, we find no substance
       in the challenge to the order impugned passed by
