the    petitioner      against            the     order       dated

18.02.2011,      whereby           the      Vikas       Adhikari,

Panchayat        Samiti,            Gharsana,             District

impugned     order     on       the   ground       that       his

contractual appointment has been discontinued

on account of the complaint made by the local

MLA, though the term of his contract has not

been expired. It is also contended in the writ

petition that his contractual appointment has

been terminated without giving any opportunity

of hearing to the petitioner.

petitioner was purely on contractual basis his

services has been discontinued by the Vikas

Adhikari, Panchayat Samiti, Gharsana as per

the conditions of contract and the sufficient

reasons has also been given in the impugned

order.
