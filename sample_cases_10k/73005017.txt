                            AWARD

                The Secretary (Labour), Government of NCT of
Delhi vide its order No. F.24(3506)/94-Lab./53122-26 dated
23.12.1996 referred an industrial dispute between the
above mentioned parties to the Labour Court with the
following terms of reference:

ID No. 187/10                                        Page 1/17
        "Whether the services of Sh. Chail Mohan Gautam
       have been terminated illegally and/or unjustifiably
       by the management, and if so, to what relief is he
       entitled and what directions are necessary in this
       respect?"



2.              The facts in brief of the case of the workman
that the workman had been working with the management
as a Junior Assistant (Stores) since 15.07.1988 on daily
wages basis and his last drawn salary was Rs.77.55 per
day and approximately he was getting Rs. 2400/- per
month.     As the management was not providing statutory
benefits to him and other employees, so he became an
active member of a union.        The union of the employees
demanded the statutory benefits from the management
from time to time, which annoyed the management.            In
order to get rid of the workman, the management issued
him a show cause notice dated 12.03.1992 leveling false
allegations. He submitted reply dated 14.03.1992 through
his counsel. The management did not find his reply
satisfactory and decided to initiate a departmental enquiry
against him. The management appointed an enquiry
officer and on the basis of the enquiry report, the
management issued a memorandum dated 30.12.1992


ID No. 187/10                                         Page 2/17
 proposing imposing of a major penalty of his removal from
service.    Vide     memorandum     dated    15.01.1993,     the
management terminated his services. The termination of
the services by the management is totally illegal, arbitrary
and against the provisions of law and principles of natural
justice because services of the workman were terminated
due to trade union activities of the workman. The workman
further submitted that punishment of termination of
services is totally disproportionate to the gravity of charge.
He sent a demand notice dated 15.06.1993 but the
management did not send its reply. The conciliation
proceedings have failed due to non cooperative attitude of
the management. He has been without any employment
since the date of termination of his services. The workman
prayed for passing an award for his reinstatement in
service with full back wages.


3.              The management admitted that the workman
was engaged as a casual worker in the project called
Embroy Transfer Technology Project. The said project was
terminated by the govt. w.e.f. 31.03.1992.       His services
alongwith        other   workmen   stood    terminated     w.e.f.
31.03.1992.        However, as a matter of precaution the


ID No. 187/10                                            Page 3/17
 enquiry was conducted and his services were dispensed
with w.e.f. 15.01.1993. The performance of the workman
was far away from satisfactory.      He was given several
warnings to improve his performance while he was dealing
in stores. As his performance was not satisfactory so he
was transferred at the Experimental Farm of the Project at
Dhauj.    The workman not only caused irregularities but
also created nuisance there and failed to perform his duty
regularly. Show cause notice dated 12.03.1992 was issued
against him. Reply of the workman dated 14.03.1992 was
not found satisfactory. The departmental enquiry was
initiated against him. Enquiry was conducted strictly
following the process prescribed in the Govt. of India Rules,
i.e. CCS (CCA) Rules. The report of enquiry officer is based
on facts, circumstances, actual proceedings, evidence and
reasons. The imposition of major penalty of removal of his
services was taken after following the due procedure as
the workman committed fraud and his performance was
unsatisfactory.
                The management denied all the allegations
levelled in the statement of claim and prayed for dismissal
of statement of claim.




ID No. 187/10                                        Page 4/17
 4.              The workman in his rejoinder controverted the
contentions made in the WS and reiterated the averments
made in the statement of claim.


5.              On the pleadings of the parties, following issues
were framed:
                1.    Whether fair and proper enquiry was
                      conducted by management?
                2.    Whether the management is not an
                      industry?
                3.    As per terms of reference.



6.              Issue No.1 was treated as preliminary issue. In
order to show that management conducted a fair and
proper enquiry, the workman examined himself as WW1.
He proved his affidavit as Ex. WW1/A and also relied on
documents Ex.WW1/1 to Ex.WW1/26.
                In   order   to   prove   that   the   enquiry   was
conducted fairly, properly and in accordance with the
principles of natural justice, the management examined
Sh. G.C. Verma, Administrative Officer as MW1/A. He filed
and proved his affidavits as Ex.MW1/A and MW1/B and
relied on documents Ex.WW1/9, Ex.MW1/1, Ex.MW1/2,
Ex.MW1/3, Ex.MW1/4 and Ex.MW1/5.

 FINDINGS ON ISSUE NO.1
7.              The enquiry issue was decided in favour of the
management and against the workman vide order dated
14.01.2011 and it was held that the evidence and material
placed on record established that enquiry was conducted
in accordance with the principles of natural justice and it
was fair and proper.


8.              I have heard the arguments of Counsels for the
parties on the point of proportionality of the quantum of
punishment and perused the file.


9.              On perusal of the pleadings of the parties,
analysing evidence and material placed on record and
considering the arguments addressed by Counsels for the
parties, I have formed my opinions on the proportionality
of the quantum of punishment and that are discussed here
in below:


FINDINGS ON PROPORTIONALITY OF QUANTUM OF
PUNISHMENT
10.             It has been argued on behalf of workman that


ID No. 187/10                                          Page 6/17
 court can modify the punishment u/s 11-<a href="/doc/1656199/" id="a_1">A of the Act</a> in
appropriate cases where the management has imposed
harsh    punishment       which   is   disproportionate   to   the
misconduct committed by the workman. He further argued
that as per charge sheet Ex.WW1/9, about five charges
were levelled against the workman by the management
but the enquiry officer in his enquiry report opined that
management could prove only one charge and could not
prove remaining charges. In these circumstances, he has
submitted that this is the appropriate case where the court
can reduce the punishment imposed by the management.


11.             In support of his arguments, he has relied on a
case <a href="/doc/1237261/" id="a_2">Mavji C. Lakum vs. Central Bank of India</a>, 2008
(VII) AD (SC) 284 . The Apex Court held that:
        "6.The Industrial Tribunal firstly came to the conclusion
        that the Departmental Inquiry was just and proper.
        However, in so far as the merits of the allegations were
        concerned, the Tribunal came to the conclusion that
        there was no evidence supporting major charges,
        though there was some misconduct on the part of
        the appellant. Again the Tribunal specifically held that
        the proved misconduct was not so serious as to invite the
        extreme punishment of discharge. Reference was thus
        partly allowed and the order of discharge was set aside.
        The Tribunal imposed the punishment of withholding one
        increment with future effect.***
        17.When we see the Tribunal's Award, it is clear that

ID No. 187/10                                             Page 7/17
        firstly the Tribunal came to the conclusion that the inquiry
       was fair and proper. Thereafter, in para 7, the Tribunal has
       considered the arguments on behalf of the bank to the
       effect that once the inquiry has been held to be legal and
       proper, no interference can be made as regards the
       punishment. It is to be noted that the first charge against
       the appellant was rough and rude behaviour with client
       Gulabchand and company's partner Harenderbhai Shah,
       while the second charges was also regarding the rude
       behaviour with the higher officers of the bank and
       disobedience with the work entrusted; the third charge
       was that he was instructed to remain present on the
       bank's account closing day, he had gone away; the fourth
       charge was regarding the breach of bank's rules
       pertaining to leave; the fifth charge was with regard to
       frequently leaving the place during office hours without
       permission while the sixth charge was regarding the
       illegally making trunk calls on the bank's phone without
       permission and the seventh charge was incurring
       excessive debts from outside.***
       19. In our opinion under <a href="/doc/1968818/" id="a_3">Section 11-A</a> of the Industrial
       Disputes Act the Tribunal was quite justified in using its
       discretion. The scope of <a href="/doc/1656199/" id="a_4">Section 11-A</a> has been explained
       by this Court from time to time in <a href="/doc/812574/" id="a_5">Life Insurance
       Corporation of India vs. R.Dhandapani</a> [(2006) 13
       SCC 613; <a href="/doc/730146/" id="a_6">Mahindra Ltd. vs. N.B.Narawade</a> [(2005) 3
       SCC 331] and <a href="/doc/575349/" id="a_7">M.P.Electricity Board vs. Jagdish
       Chandra Sharma</a> [(2005) 3 SCC 401]. Lastly, this Court
       has held that in <a href="/doc/1345098/" id="a_8">L and T Komatsu Ltd. vs.
       N.Uadayakumar</a> [(2008) 1 SCC 224] that assaulting of
       giving abuses to the superior would justify the dismissal.
       We have carefully examined the facts in all the above
       cases and find that the appellant's case nowhere comes
       near the described in all the above four cases. After all
       the Tribunal was firstly correct in holding that the
       misbehaviour was not wholly proved, did not deserve the
       extreme punishment of discharge." [Emphasis supplied]


ID No. 187/10                                             Page 8/17
                 Turning to the case in hand, I find that facts of
the above referred case are different from the present
case. In the said case, it was the conclusion of the Tribunal
that there was no evidence regarding major charges but in
the present case, main charge of commission of fraud has
been    proved       as   mentioned   in    the   enquiry    report.
Therefore, the principles of law laid down in case <a href="/doc/1237261/" id="a_9">Mavji C.
Lakum vs. Central Bank of India</a>, (supra) will not
provide any benefit to the workman.


12.             On the other hand, Ld. Counsel for management
argued that though this court has power to alter the
punishment in appropriate cases yet the court must be
slow in altering the punishment and punishment could only
be altered where the punishment was so grave that it
shocked the conscious of this court. He further argued that
where there are two opinions, then opinion which supports
the administrative decision of the management regarding
imposing of punishment, should be given priority.


13.             In support of his arguments, he relied on a case
<a href="/doc/890245/" id="a_10">Ballarpur        Industries    Ltd.   vs.   Presiding       Officer,
Labour</a> Court, Bhubaneshwar and Others, 2004-II-LLJ

ID No. 187/10                                               Page 9/17
 551. In this case, Orissa High Court observed that:
      "8.We may state that the power of the Labour Court under
      <a href="/doc/1656199/" id="a_11">Section 11-A</a> is undoubtedly wide and is available to be
      exercised in the interest of justice. Exercise of such far
      reaching discretionary power is governed by judicial
      considerations and has to be exercised keeping the object
      of <a href="/doc/1656199/" id="a_12">Section 11-A</a> in view. The conduct of the opposite party
      No. 3 in tampering with the attendance register for
      the purpose of getting wages for four days is
      reprehensible and is a gross misconduct. He had
      committed an offence of forgery and punishable
      under <a href="/doc/1656199/" id="a_13">Section 465</a> as well as under <a href="/doc/556166/" id="a_14">Section 468</a> I.P.C.
      (forgery for the purpose of cheating). <a href="/doc/722811/" id="a_15">In Regional
      Manager and Disciplinary Authority, State Bank of
      India Hyderabad v. S. Mohammed Gaffar</a>, AIR 2002 SC
      3037: 2002-III-LLJ-529, the delinquent workman was a clerk
      and while preparing establishment register got included
      unauthorizedly three increments for himself to which he was
      not legitimately entitled to. For such misconduct, he was
      discharged from service. The Supreme Court held that
      punishment imposed on him was just and proper and cannot
      be interfered with in view of the gross misconduct
      committed by him. Facts</pre><p id="p_1"> of the present case are similar to
      the case mentioned above. Considering the facts and
      circumstances, we are inclined to hold that the Labour Court
      illegally exercised its discretion in exercise of its power
      under <a href="/doc/1656199/" id="a_16">Section 11-A</a> by directing reinstatement of opposite
      party No. 3 in service. The award, therefore, cannot be
      sustained in law."

Manager,             Rajasthan     State       Road       Transport
Corporation vs. Sohan Lal</a>, 2004-III-LLJ 1078, wherein
the Apex Court observed that:

       "11.Assuming for argument sake that the High Court by the
      impugned order proceeded on the basis that though the
      misconduct is proved the punishment was disproportionate
      and it is on that basis that the impugned order is made,
      even then we are unable to agree with the order of the
      Appellate Bench of the High Court because it is not the
      normal jurisdiction of the superior Courts to interfere with
      the quantum of sentence unless the said sentence is wholly
      disproportionate to the misconduct proved. No such finding
      has been recorded by the Appellate Bench in the impugned
      order. Since the misconduct proved is one of
      dishonesty, the quantum of loss is immaterial, it is
      the loss of confidence that matters. In such a situation
      if the Tribunal chooses to uphold the order of dismissal and
      refuse to interfere with such termination and the learned
      single Judge of the High Court agreed with the said order of
      the Tribunal, then Appellate Bench ought not to have
      interfered with the quantum of sentence. Having perused
      the facts of the case we are in agreement with the finding of
      the Tribunal as well as learned single Judge, hence, we are
      of the considered opinion that the Appellate Bench fell in
      error in interfering with the orders of the Courts below
      merely on the basis of offer made by the appellant before
      it."

       the primary factor to be taken into consideration. In our
       opinion, when a person is found guilty of misappropriating the
       corporation's funds, there is nothing wrong in the corporation
       losing confidence or faith in such a person and awarding a

      stated in the Wednesbury's case(supra) the Court would
      not go into the correctness of the choice made by the
      administrator open to him and the Court should not
      substitute its decision to that of the administrator. The

      the conscience of the Court/Tribunal, there is no scope for

      exceptional and rare cases, impose appropriate
      punishment by recording cogent reasons in support

punishment for removal of services was not altered as the
courts were of the opinion that tampering with attendance
register for the purpose of getting wages for four days was
re-apprehensible and in        misconduct of dishonesty, the
quantum of loss is immaterial and loss of confidence is
material. In the present case, the misconduct against the
workman was that he destroyed the muster roll and
replaced it by new one. Besides, marked his attendance
therein for causing wrongful gain to himself and wrongful
loss to the management. Therefore, I am of the view that
principles of law laid down in above referred cases are
applicable on the facts of the present case as the
allegations of misconduct levelled by the management
were found correct by the inquiry officer. I am also of the

penalty of termination of services of the workman was
disproportionate to the serious misconduct committed by
the workman.
