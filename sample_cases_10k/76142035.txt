work he stopped his scooter on the culverts of minor to urinate. In the

meantime, three young persons came on a scooter from the side of

Village Jandu Singha, among them two were clean shaven and third was

a Sikh gentleman. They stopped their scooter and one of them started his

scooter and they drove towards Village Chugiti. He raised noise but

those persons sped away.

the police, FIR No.595 dated 6.9.2001 under <a href="/doc/1101188/" id="a_3">Section 379</a>/<a href="/doc/812083/" id="a_4">411</a> IPC,

Police Station Sadar, Jalandhar was registered. The scooter was

recovered from Mohinder Singh and Vijay Kumar @ Gabbar who were

arrested. On completion of investigation, final report under <a href="/doc/1412034/" id="a_5">Section 173</a>

Cr.P.C. was presented in the Court.
</p>
<p id="p_4">            The accused were chargesheeted under <a href="/doc/812083/" id="a_6">Section 411</a> IPC to

which, they pleaded not guilty and claimed trial.

</p><p id="p_5">            To prove its allegations, prosecution examined as many as

five witnesses.

<p id="p_6">            After closure of evidence of the prosecution, statements of

the petitioners under <a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_7">Section 313</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure

were recorded. They denied the incriminating evidence put to them and

pleaded innocence and false implication.
</p>
<p id="p_7">            Considering the submissions made by learned Assistant

Public Prosecutor for the State as well as the counsel representing the

petitioners and evaluating the evidence brought on record, learned trial

Court convicted and sentenced the petitioners as indicated above.

Aggrieved against the judgment of conviction and order of sentence, the

petitioners filed an appeal, which was dismissed by learned Additional

Sessions Judge, Jalandhar vide judgment dated 5.2.2007.

criminal revision petition.

<p id="p_9">             The submissions made by Mr.AS Gill, counsel for the

petitioner and Mrs.Lavanya Paul, Assistant Advocate General, Punjab

representing the State have been heard and record perused.

</p><p id="p_10">             At the very outset, learned counsel for the petitioners

contended that in view of the concurrent findings of both the courts

below holding the petitioners guilty for the offence punishable under

<a href="/doc/812083/" id="a_8">Section 411</a> IPC, he does not want to pursue the present petition on

merits as regards the judgment of conviction, however, he contended that

the petitioners being poor persons and having the       responsibility of

families, their sentence be reduced to the period already undergone.

</p><p id="p_11">             A close examination of the prosecution evidence reveals that

no holes can be picked up in the findings recorded by the learned trial

Court and affirmed by learned First Appellate Court, for arriving at the

conclusion that the charge against the accused (petitioners) stands

established and therefore, the judgment of conviction is maintained

             Coming to the quantum of sentence, admittedly the scooter

of the complainant had been recovered. As per the custody certificate

placed on record by learned State counsel, petitioner Mohinder Singh

has undergone more than five months and petitioner Vijay Kumar @

Gabbar has undergone about five months out of the actual sentence.

</p><p id="p_12">             Taking into consideration the entirety of the facts and

circumstances of the case, it will be in the interest of justice if the

sentence awarded to the petitioner is reduced to the period already

undergone by each of them.
</p>
<p id="p_13">             Resultantly, the present criminal revision petition is

disposed of reducing the sentence of the petitioners to the period already

undergone.
