<p id="p_1">          The accused in SC 657/02 on the file of the

Additional Sessions Judge (Adhoc II) Alappuzha, who was

convicted for the offences under Section 55(a) and 8(2) of

the Abkari Act and sentenced to undergo imprisonments,

has come up in the appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_2">     2.   In short, the prosecution case is that on

26.07.1999 at about 6.30 p.m., the accused/appellant was

found possessing 2 litres of illicit arrack in a plastic can

and he was apprehended while he was entering a gravel

road in front of a temple. The prosecution examined five

witnesses and marked four documents.               One defence

witness was also examined. MO1 is the can allegedly

possessed by the appellant, which contained illicit arrack.

</p><p id="p_3">     3.   Heard the learned counsel for the appellant and

the learned Public Prosecutor.
</p>
<p id="p_4">     4.   PW1, was the Excise Circle Inspector at the

material time. PW2 was the Excise Inspector, who was in

the party of PW1. Both these witnesses deposed that on

26.07.1991, they were on petrol duty.           They were

travelling in official vehicle.   They stopped the vehicle

near a temple at Thamarakkulam.           When they were

proceeding, they saw the accused coming from the side of

a bridge with a can in his possession.       On seeing the

Excise Officers, he attempted to escape.           He was

apprehended. On examination of the can possessed by

him, it was found that he possessed about 2 litres of illicit

arrack in it. 300 ml illicit arrack was taken as sample in a

375 ml bottle. It was sealed and labelled from the place of

detection itself. Ext.P1 mahazar was prepared from the

place and the accused along with articles were taken to

Excise Range Office. The articles and the accused were

entrusted to PW3.
</p>
<p id="p_5">        5.      PWs   1 and 2 were subjected      to cross

examination. Questions were put to PW1 to suggest that

the identity of MO1 can was not properly revealed for non-

mentioning of the colour of the can in Ext.P2 Mahazar.

The learned Public Prosecutor contended that MO1 can

was produced on the next day itself before the court as

per Ext.P3 thondi list. PW1 deposed at the time of cross

examination, the accused was apprehended from the side

Crl. A. No.72 of 2005
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                3</span>


of a rubber estate and it was understood that he is a local

resident. Two witnesses were asked to sign on Ext.P1

Mahazar. PW4 is a witness to Ext.P1 mahazar. He did not

support the prosecution case to the fullest extent. PW1

and 2 at the time of cross examination stated that

Raghavan, whose property is adjacent to the place of

occurrence, was not cited as witness because he was not

present at the time of apprehension. Further, Raghavan

is said to be a relative of the appellant.

</p><p id="p_6">        6.      The   learned counsel   for the  appellant

contended that the prosecution case cannot be believed

because it will be normal human conduct to throw away

the can if the accused had seen the Excise Officers

approaching him. The offence under Section 55(a) and 8

(2) will be attracted if the person is found to possess

illegal arrack.         Whether the accused jettisons the

contraband or not will make no effect on the prosecution

case, if it could be established that he possessed the

contraband in violation of law. Therefore, the prosecution

case cannot be thrown over board only for the reason that

they did not mention that the accused attempted to throw

out the contraband article.
</p>
<p id="p_7">Crl. A. No.72 of 2005
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                  4</span>


</p><p id="p_8">        7.      I have carefully examined the evidence of PW1

also. The testimony of PW1 will not improve the case of

the accused. Neither PW1 nor suggestions put at the time

of cross-examination of PW 1 and 2 would show that PW1

and 2 had any reason to falsely implicate the accused in

this crime. Therefore, I find the evidence of PW 1,2 and 3

is credible and proper.          Further there is no delay in

producing the accused and the contraband articles before

the court. Ext.P2 is the crime and occurrence report and

Ext.P3 thondi list produced before the court on the next

day itself.         Ext.P4 chemical analysis report also would

show that the contraband article reached the chemical lab

in a properly sealed condition. Therefore, I do not find

any reason to find that the procedure adopted by the

prosecution is vitiated by any legal infirmities. Reckoning

the entire evidence on record, I find that the trial court is

legally correct in finding that the accused was found in

possession of illicit arrack as urged by the prosecution.

However, I find the there was no reason for convicting the

accused both under Section 55(a) and 8(2) of Abkari Act .

</p><p id="p_9">        8.      Regarding question of sentence, the learned

counsel for the appellant would submit that the sentence

Crl. A. No.72 of 2005
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                  5</span>


imposed is harsh. I find that there is some force in the

argument. Reckoning the facts and circumstances of the

case,       I find that the sentence can be reduced in the

following manner.
</p>
<p id="p_10">                  In the result, the appeal is partly allowed.

Conviction of the appellant under Section 55(a) of the

Abkari Act is confirmed. The sentence of the appellant is

reduced that he shall undergo rigorous imprisonment for a

period of three months and shall pay a fine of

Rs.1,00,000/- (Rupees One lakh only), which is the

statutory minimum prescribed under the Act. In default of

payment of fine, he shall undergo simple imprisonment for

a period of one month. He is entitled to get set off under
