JUDGMENT
</pre>

<p id="p_1">   1.       The present appeal has been brought by the appellant against the
        judgment and order on sentence passed by Ld. ACMM (North) thereby
        convicting   and   sentencing   the   appellant   u/s   138   <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_1">Negotiable
        Instruments Act</a>, 1988 and imposing sentence of six months and fine of
        Rs. 1,50,000/-. Out of the fine amount, compensation to the tune of
        Rs. 1,45,000 is awarded to the respondent.
</p>
<p id="p_2">C.A. NO. 39/11                                             Page 1 of 4 pages
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                          2</span>

</p><p id="p_3">   2.       The brief facts giving rise to the present appeal are that
        respondent filed a complaint u/s 138 of <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_2">Negotiable Instruments Act</a> on
        the basis of cheque dated 10.08.2009 issued by the appellant for Rs. 1
        Lakh in favour of the complainant. It is alleged that sum of Rs. 1 Lakh
        was advanced as loan to the accused/appellant vide promissory note
        Ex.PW1/8 and to discharge the said liability, the above mentioned
        cheque was issued by the accused/appellant. The accused/appellant
        was summoned by the trial court and notice u/s 251 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_3">Cr.P.C</a> was served
        to which accused pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. During the trial,
        complainant      was     examined      and     cross       examined         and
        accused/appellant also examined himself and was cross-examined.
        Ld. Trial court held that complainant has been able to prove his case
        whereas accused has failed to rebut the presumptions and also the
        defence set up by the accused is unreliable.
</p><p id="p_4">   3.       I   have    heard   Sh.   Pankaj   Paliwal,   Ld.    Counsel    for     the
        appellant/accused and Sh. Vikramjeet Saini, Ld. Counsel for the
        respondent and given due consideration to the grounds of appeal,
        impugned judgment, facts and circumstances of the case and the trial
        court record.
</p>

<p id="p_5">   4.       The complainant / respondent filed the complaint on the basis of
        cheque of Rs. 1 Lakh executed by the accused/appellant. It is alleged
        that Rs. 1,00,000/- has been taken as loan by the accused/appellant
        on 10.03.2008 and in order to repay the sum, cheque in question was
        issued but dishonoured. The appellant/accused on the other hand,
        deposed about the loan transactions of February 2007, November


C.A. NO. 39/11                                                  Page 2 of 4 pages
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                          3</span>

        2007 and August 2008 in his evidence whereby he had taken loan
        from the complainant and also about repayment of the sums by way of
        installments.   Accused has not given any specific statement with
        respect to the promissory note and loan taken in the March 2008.
        Accused has failed to show repayment by way of installments as
        alleged. The legal presumption in favour of the complainant has not
        been rebutted and burden of proof did not shift upon the complainant.
        The execution of the cheque and promissory note have been admitted
        by the accused although it is stated that cheque was given blank. No
        independent witness has been examined to prove defence so set up
        by the accused.
</p><p id="p_6">   5. It is also important to note that during the proceedings of the case,
        accused/appellant settled for Rs, 1,10,000/- on 10.02.2010. Thereafter
        matter was disposed off by the trial court as compounded but since
        accused failed to make the payment, matter was revived. The act of
        accused in settling the matter for Rs. 1,10,000/- further strengthens the
        version of the complainant. Stand of the accused that he had only to
        pay Rs. 70,000/- to the complainant has no merit or substance. The
        complainant has been able to establish the case against the accused
        by way of bringing sufficient evidence on record whereas accused has
        failed to rebut the presumption arising in favour of the complainant by
        virtue of <a href="/doc/268919/" id="a_4">section 139</a> NI Act. I find no error with the judgment of the trial
        court. There is no justification to interfere with the judgment and order
        on sentence.
</p><p id="p_7">   6.       In view of aforesaid observations, finding no merit or substance in
        the appeal, the same is dismissed.
