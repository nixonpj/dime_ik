<p id="p_1">     The petitioner herein has appeared for 1st year MBBS

Examination conducted by the 1st respondent University in

September 2011.          When the result was declared on

21.12.2011, the petitioner was shown as failed in Anatomy

paper by six marks. Then the petitioner approached the 3rd

respondent for a photocopy of the answer sheet and the

same was given to her without score sheet. Even thought

she had sought for a facility of revaluation, she was

informed that there is no such provision for revaluation in

the Kerala University of Health Sciences Act, 2010.

</p><p id="p_2">     2. Ext.P2 is the representation sent by the petitioner

to the 2nd respondent seeking revaluation. Learned counsel

appearing for the petitioner submits that the petitioner

later appeared for the supplementary examination. Going

by the result of the supplementary examination, she has

passed in the said paper.

W.P.(C)No.7815 of 2012

</p><p id="p_4">     3. The learned counsel appearing for the petitioner

submits that even though she has been declared as passed

in the supplementary examination, if the result of the

examination conducted in September 2011 is declared in

her favour she will not lose her six months duration of the

course.
</p>
<p id="p_5">     4.    The learned standing counsel appearing for the

respondent University opposes the prayers of the petitioner.

A statement has been filed on behalf of the respondents 1 to

</p><p id="p_6">3. It is pointed out in the statement that double valuations

are prescribed for under-graduate theory examinations by

the University. Second valuation is carried out by a second

examiner as soon as the first valuation is over and the mark

is taken as the average of the two valuations. Again, if

there is difference more than 15% of the total marks in the

two valuations, a third valuation is conducted by a third

examiner and the effective mark in this case is taken as the

average of any two nearer marks.       The above valuation

W.P.(C)No.7815 of 2012

strategy has been approved by the Academic Council held

on 17.03.2012 and later ratified by the General Council on

15.05.2012. It is therefore pointed out that unless there is a

specific provision enabling a revaluation as sought for, this

Court cannot direct the University to consider the prayer of

the petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_7">     The learned counsel for the petitioner prays for a

direction to the Vice Chancellor to consider Ext.P2

representation. I am not expressing anything on the merits

of the matter and the Writ Petition is disposed of by

directing the Vice Chancellor to furnish reply to the

petitioner on Ext.P2 within a period of three weeks from the

date of production of a copy of the judgment.
