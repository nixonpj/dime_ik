Dharam Pal                                                 --Appellant

                         Versus

Maha Singh &amp; others                                        --Respondents

CORAM:- HON'BLE MR.JUSTICE TEJINDER SINGH DHINDSA.

Present:-    Mr. R.S. Malik, Advocate for the appellant.

             ***

<p id="p_1">TEJINDER SINGH DHINDSA.J

             The plaintiff-appellant is in second appeal before this Court

having remained unsuccessful in both the courts below.

</p><p id="p_2">             Briefly stated, the plaintiff-appellant filed a suit praying for a

decree of declaration to the effect that there is a passage (Rasta) of 2 karams

in the Rect. &amp; Killa Nos.40/1 and 10 of the defendants in the Eastern side

and further prayed for a consequential relief of permanent injunction to the

effect that the defendants be restrained from creating any hindrance in the

use of the said passage. It was pleaded that the plaintiff-appellant and

defendants are the heirs of Nanhu Ram, who was the owner in possession of

agriculture land, the details of which were furnished in para 2 of the plaint.

It was stated that a family partition took place between the parties in the

year 1972 and in pursuance thereto all the legal heirs got their shares. Even

the mutation was sanctioned on 1972 in this regard. The plaintiff-appellant

asserted that at the time of the family partition in the year 1972 a passage of

2 karams had been provided to the plaintiff-appellant from Rect. &amp; Killa

No.40/1 and 10 that is from the land of the defendants for his entry and exit.

As such it was pleaded that since the plaintiff-appellant had been using such
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1"> RSA No. 3143 of 2011(O&amp;M)                      -2-</span>

passage since the year 1972. He had acquired the easementary right of

necessity. The defendants, it was asserted, were acting in collusion with

each other and had started obstructing the plaintiff-appellant from using the

passage and as such the suit had been filed.
</p>
<p id="p_3">             Upon notice, defendants no.1 and 3 put in appearance, whereas

defendant no.2 was proceeded ex-parte. A joint written statement was filed

by the defendant no.1 and 3 denying the fact of any family partition. Even

the alleged passage of 2 karams was denied. It was asserted in the written

statement that the plaintiff-appellant had set up a totally false case.

</p><p id="p_4">             From the pleadings of the parties the main issue framed by the

Trial Court was to the effect as to whether there is a Rasta of 2 karams in the

Rect. &amp; Killa No.40/1 &amp; 10 of the defendants towards the Eastern side.

Upon appreciation of evidence and having heard counsel for the parties the

Trial Court dismissed the suit. Being dissatisfied the plaintiff-appellant

preferred an appeal and by the impugned judgment dated 28.2.2011 the

Additional District Judge, Fast Track Court, Rohtak has dismissed the

appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_5">             I have heard Mr. R.S. Malik, learned counsel for the appellant.

             I find that the present appeal is wholly devoid of merit. The

plaintiff-appellant had himself admitted in his plaint that there exists no

passage in the revenue record. The jamabandi placed on the file also does

not reflect the existence of any such alleged passage.            The plaintiff-

appellant himself upon being cross-examined as PW-1 as also the other

witnesses i.e PW-2 and PW-3 have also deposed that the revenue record

does not reflect the alleged passage. No proof or evidence in respect to the

alleged family partition was brought on record. Both the courts below have
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2"> RSA No. 3143 of 2011(O&amp;M)                      -3-</span>

noticed that even the revenue record does not reflect any such passage. It

was incumbent for the plaintiff-appellant to have proved the existence of

alleged passage of 2 karams as also regarding the factum of a family

partition having taken place, wherein such passage had been provided for.

The courts below have clearly noticed that the evidence adduced on the file

shows otherwise i.e. the non-existence of the alleged passage of 2 karams as

also there having been no family partition.
</p>
<p id="p_6">             I do not find it a fit case that would warrant interference with

the concurrent findings of the courts below.
</p>
<p id="p_7">             The present appeal does not raise any question of law much less

substantial question of law.
</p>
<p id="p_8">             The appeal is wholly devoid of merit and is, accordingly,

dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_9">             Appeal dismissed.
