<p id="p_3">              Heard Mr. Shaikh, learned Counsel for the applicants and Mr.
Walvekar, learned Counsel for the opponents in the Civil Applications.
</p>

<p id="p_4">2.            By these applications, the applicants have sought direction to
accept amount of compensation within two weeks by the trial Court i.e Small
Causes Court, Pune.
</p>

<p id="p_5">3.            Mr. Shaikh has invited my attention to the orders dated                   9 th
October, 2017 and 8th January, 2018 passed by this Court. By order dated 9 th
October, 2017, this Court fixed reasonable compensation @ Rs.2,000/- per
month. The arrears were ordered to be deposited from 1 st September, 1993.
The applicants were also directed to deposit monthly compensation on or
before 10th day of each succeeding month.

</p><p id="p_7">4.             By order dated 8th January, 2018, the applicants were permitted to
deposit amount of Rs.50,000/- on or before 9 th January, 2018 and further
balance outstanding of Rs. 54,000/- on or before 10 th July, 2018 in the Small
Causes Court, Pune. Civil Applications were allowed in terms of prayer clauses
</p><p id="p_8">(a), (b) and (c). It was, however, made clear that the applicants shall strictly
confine to the time limit by which the amounts are to be deposited by them
and no further indulgence on this count would be granted.
</p>

<p id="p_9">5.             Mr. Shaikh submitted that the applicants approached the Small
Causes Court, Pune             by filing applications on      23 rd July, 2018 seeking
permission to deposit the amount. The Small Causes Court did not accede to
the request and directed them to apply this Court. Immediately, on 4 th August,
2018, the applicants have filed applications seeking extension. Mr. Shaikh
assures that the applicants will hereinafter not commit any default in
depositing the arrears as also will go on regularly depositing compensation in
the Small Causes Court, Pune under intimation in writing to learned Advocate
for the opponents. In case they are unable to deposit the amount of
compensation within the stipulated time, they will apply for extension before
this Court and will not approach the Small Causes Court Pune                          for that
purpose.
</p>

<p id="p_10">6.             On the other hand, Mr. Walvekar strenuously opposed the
applications. He submitted that in fact by order dated 8 th January, 2018, it was
made clear that the applicants were bound to deposit compensation on or
before 10th July, 2018 and no extension will be granted. Despite that, they did
not move this Court for extension of time and approached the Small Causes
Court, Pune. He, therefore, submitted that no case is made out for extension of
time.

</p><p id="p_12">7.            I have considered the rival submissions advanced by learned
Counsel for the parties. I have also perused the material on record. A perusal of
the record shows that after hearing both the sides, the Civil Revision
Applications were admitted by issuing rule and ad-interim stay was granted. By
order dated 9th October, 2017, this Court fixed compensation @ Rs.2,000/- per
month considering the fact that the premises admeasures 100 square feet and
are used for residential purpose. Considering the financial capacity of the
applicants, this Court fixed reasonable compensation @ Rs.2000/- per month.
</p>

<p id="p_13">8.              By order dated 8th January, 2018, this Court extended time for
depositing arrears of compensation up to 10 th July, 2018. It is not in dispute
that the applicants did not deposit the amount within the stipulated time.
Instead of approaching this Court for extension of time, they approached the
trial Court on 23rd July 2018 for extension of time. The learned trial Judge was,
therefore, justified in not entertaining the applications made by the applicants.
The applicants have thereafter taken out these applications on 4 th August,
2018, inter alia, praying for extension of time for depositing the amount in the
trial Court within two weeks from the date of the order.
</p>

<p id="p_14">9.            In view thereof, time stipulated in the order dated 8 th January,
2018 is extended up to and inclusive of 25 th February, 2019. The applicants
shall deposit the amount in the trial Court under intimation in writing to the
learned Counsel for the opponent. The Small Causes Court, Pune shall accept
the amount so deposited. It is made clear that in case, the applicants will go on
depositing monthly compensation on or before 15th day of each succeeding
month in the trial Court under intimation in writing to opponents Advocate. In
case the applicants commit any default, the opponents will be at liberty to
apply for vacating the interim order. The applicants are at liberty to move this
Court if exigency again arises for extension of time and shall not move the
