<pre id="pre_1">25.4.2013.
 ap                            W. P. 17137 (W) of 2012

                               Sri Kebal Ram Mahapatra
                                                 Vs.
                               The State of West Bengal &amp; Ors.

                                        Mr. Binoy Das
                                            ... For the petitioner.


                     Affidavit of service filed in Court today be taken on record.

                     In spite of service, none appears on behalf of the respondents even at the time</pre>

<p id="p_1">             of second call.
</p>
<p id="p_2">                     After considering the submissions made by the learned advocate for the

             petitioner and upon perusing the instant writ petition, it appears that the principal

             grievance of the writ petitioner is delayed payment of gratuity by the State, upon his

             superannuation from service on 30th June, 2007.

</p><p id="p_3">                      It appears that this matter is squarely covered by a recent decision of this

             Court rendered in the case of Mohan Ch. Halder &amp; Ors. vs. State of West Bengal &amp;

             Ors. in W.P. 30264 (W) of 2008 along with several other writ petitions on 14th May,

             2009.
</p>
<p id="p_4">                      I am of the view that similar directions can be given in the
             instant writ petition, as directed by this Court in Mohan Ch. Halder's
             case. I, therefore, dispose of the instant writ petition by directing the
             Director of Pension and Provident Fund and Group Insurance to pay
             interest at the rate of 10% on the gratuity amount to be computed
             from the revised date of pension of the petitioner uptil the date on
             which the gratuity amount is disbursed. However, in the event there
             is any material before the said authority that because of any wilful
             laches on the part of the concerned employee in receiving the
             gratuity amount or the disbursement of gratuity was held up for
             some specific negligent acts on the part of the claimant and the said
             sum could not be paid on the date of superannuation or at any later
             date, then it would be permissible for the said authority to decline
             payment of interest. But before finally deciding this issue, an
             opportunity of hearing shall be given to the writ petitioner and the
             reason shall be disclosed as to why the interest on gratuity is not
             being paid in his case. In the event there is any disciplinary
             proceeding pending against the petitioner, then also the authorities
             would be entitled to withhold the payment of gratuity.
</p><p id="p_5">                      The respondent authorities are accordingly directed

             to release interest on delayed payment of gratuity to the
 petitioner         to      be    computed          from        the     date       of

superannuation of the concerned employee uptil the date

of disbursement of gratuity.
</p>
<p id="p_6">           Such payment shall be made within ninety days from the date of

communication of this order. In the event the authorities, for reasons indicated

above, decide not to pay the interest to the writ petitioner, he shall be informed in

writing, within thirty days from the date of communication of this order, the reason

as to why such interest would not be paid and thereafter the procedure directed

above shall be followed.
</p>
<p id="p_7">      Urgent photostat certified copy of this order, if applied for, be given to the

parties.
