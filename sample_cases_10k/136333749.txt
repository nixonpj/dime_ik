                          JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1"> Sathish Ninan, J



    An   order   negativing   the   challenge   of   the   wife,

against the jurisdiction of the Family Court, Ottappalam

to entertain and try G.O.P No. 217 of 2017 filed by the

husband under Section 12 of the Guardian and Wards act,

is assailed in this original petition.

</p><p id="p_2">    2. The husband and wife are abroad. The minor child

was born at U.S.A and is a U.S citizen. The Court at

United States has passed an order granting custody to

the mother. Therefore, the Family Court, Ottappalam does

not have jurisdiction to entertain the original petition

under Guardian and <a href="/doc/1608688/" id="a_1">Wards Act</a>, is the contention.
O.P(F.C) No.631/2017
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                     2</span>



</p><p id="p_3">      3. As directed by this Court, the father of the

wife,    who    is     her   power   of   attorney     holder    and   the

petitioner in this original petition, along with his

wife, and also the respondent husband with his parents,

were present in Court today and we interacted with them.

We find sufficient reasons not to interfere with the

impugned order. It is not in dispute that the child is

presently within the jurisdiction of the Family Court,

Ottappalam, and is being taken care of by the maternal

grand parents. As regards the order passed by the Court

in United States, it is an ex parte order and is stated

to have been passed when the husband was in India. The

following proceedings are pending between the parties,

before various courts in Kerala:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">        1. M.O.P 302/2016 before the Family Court,
        Palakkad for divorce.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">        2. GOP 217/2017 before the Family Court,
        Ottappalam with regard to custody of child
        (from which the present proceedings arise).
</blockquote><pre id="pre_2">        3      O.S      82/2007      before      the    Munsiff-
        Magistrate's           Court,         Mannarkaud        for
O.P(F.C) No.631/2017
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                           3</span>



        defamation.
</pre><blockquote id="blockquote_3">        4. O.P 711/2017 before the Family Court,
        Ottappalam for damages.</blockquote><p id="p_4">



</p><p id="p_5">      4. Both sides agree that all the proceedings can be

transferred        to    one       court       and    be     tried    jointly.       The

parties are also in agreement regarding the choice of

the court for trial, namely the Family Court, Palakkad.

</p><p id="p_6">      5. What should be the arrangement regarding the

custody       of    the       child        till       the     disposal        of     the

proceedings, is the next issue deliberated between the

parties. As noticed supra, both the parents of the child

are not in station. The child is presently with the

maternal grand parents. The child is aged only 2 years.

We donot think it proper to disturb the custody at this

stage.       However,        the    rights      of     the     father       cannot   be

brushed aside. The father and the paternal grand parents

shall have visitation rights. Therefore, we make the

following arrangement.
</p>
<pre id="pre_3">       (i)             The     custody          of     the     minor        child
       -Shankar         Pakath      Menon,           shall    be     with    the
O.P(F.C) No.631/2017
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                           4</span>



       maternal        grand        parents.         This       shall    be    on
</pre><p id="p_7">       condition that the passport of the child be
       surrendered before the Family Court, Palakkad
       on 28.02.2018.
</p><p id="p_8">       (ii)            The father, and in his absence the
       paternal grand parents, shall have visitation
       rights from 11.00 am till 1.00 pm on every 1 st
       and 3rd saturdays.
</p><p id="p_9">       (iii)           The        venue        for    exercise          of    the
       visitation rights shall be the Family Court,
       Palakkad. The child shall not be taken out of
       the precints of the court.
</p><p id="p_10">       (iv)             Either parties shall be entitled to
       move      the         Family            Court,       Palakkad          for
       appropriate           modifications            or    directions         as
       circumstances may warrant.
</p>
<p id="p_11">      6. Accordingly, while upholding the impugned order

finding jurisdiction for the Family Court at Ottappalam,

on   the      consent        of    the     parties         we    direct       that   GOP

217/2017       before        the     Family          Court,       Ottappalam,        O.S

82/2017        before         the         Munsiff          Magistrate's         Court,

Mannarkaud and O.P 711/2017 before the Family Court,

Ottappalam shall stand withdrawn and transferred to the

No.    302/2016.       The   interim     arrangement,      as   directed

above, regarding the custody of child, shall govern the

parties.
