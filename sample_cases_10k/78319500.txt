CORAM: HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE SHIVAJI PANDEY
ORAL JUDGMENT
Date: 01-05-2017

                  Heard learned counsel for the petitioner and counsel for

   the State.
</p>
<p id="p_8">                  In this case the petitioner is challenging the order dated

   14.10.2016, whereby and whereunder, the S.D.O., Begusarai has held

   that in view of Clause 2.8 ([k), the license of the petitioner bearing No.

   01/2010 has automatically been cancelled.

</p><p id="p_9">                  It appears that after the enforcement of Bihar Targeted

   P.D.S. (Control) Order, 2016, all the PDS Dealers of Begusarai

   district were directed to submit their old licence so that new license

   can be issued. In pursuance thereof, the petitioner, running the PDS

   shop, has also submitted. In course of enquiry, it has been found that

   he has deposited the license fee up to 31.12.2014, whereafter, he has

        not renewed the license and that can be done after deposit of Rs. 50/-

        as a late fine and the maximum period was allowed by eight months.

</p><p id="p_10">                        From the impugned order, it appears that the office order

        no. 311 dated 8.9.2016 and letter no. 317 dated 15.9.2016, the

        petitioner was given liberty to deposit the license fee and the

        application for renewal but, he has neither filed an application for

        renewal of the license nor deposited the late fee. The licensing

        authority has placed reliance on Clause 34(iv) of the Bihar Targeted

        PDS (Control) Order, 2016 as well as Clause 2.8 ¼[k½ of the 2001

        Control Order including Memo No. 1800 dated 2.3.2015.

</p><p id="p_11">                        Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that he has

        deposited the license fee within a period of six months, placed

        reliance on the order of this Court dated 30.3.2017 passed in C.W.J.C.

        No. 2695 of 2016 but, there the Court has not decided any issue rather

        has only observed for taking a decision in accordance with law.

</p><p id="p_12">                        When this part of the order has been dictated, learned

        counsel for the petitioner seeks permission of this Court to withdraw

        this application with a liberty to file an appeal before the appellate

        authority.
</p>
<p id="p_13">                        This writ application is dismissed as withdrawn with the

        aforementioned liberty to file an appeal and the appellate authority

        will be obliged to dispose of the same within a period of four months
           Patna High Court CWJC No.812 of 2017 dt.01-05-2017                    3
