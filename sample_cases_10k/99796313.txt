              Vide this Ex-parte judgment, I shall decide the petition filed
  U/sec. 14 (1) (a) &amp; (j) of the <a href="/doc/679372/" id="a_1">Delhi Rent Control Act</a>, 1958 (herein after

</p>
<p id="p_3">  1.           In sum and substance, the case of the petitioner is that
  petitioner is the landlord and respondent is tenant in respect of one shop
  on the ground floor in property bearing no. 5839 Basti Harphool Singh,
  North, Sadar Bazar, Delhi-06 as shown in red colour in the site plan
  attached with the petition (hereinafter referred to as 'suit property). The
  suit shop was let out in the year 1989 and lastly rent of the tenanted
  premises was paid @ Rs. 230/- per month excluding the electricity and
  water charges.
</p>

<p id="p_4">  2.           The suit premises was let out to the respondent by Sh. Hazi
  Riazuddin, father of the petitioner. Respondents are the habitual
  defaulter in payment of rent since January, 2005 till date and they did
  not pay the rent despite repeated requests and demands. There was
  letting of only one shop but subsequently the respondent dig out the
  flooring of the tenanted premises and made its flooring 2 and ½ feet
  down from the level of the road and also extended            the parchatti
  adjacent to the roof of the shop in question without taking the permission
  and consent of the petitioner whether written or oral which caused
  substantial damages to the petitioner and decreased the cost of the
  property in question.
</p>

<p id="p_5">  3.           Tenancy of      the respondent was      terminated    through
  registered legal notice dated 01/08/2006 and letter clarifications dated
  16/04/2007 but despite service they failed to comply hence, the present
  petition for eviction was filed.
</p>

<p id="p_6">E no. 273/2008                                                       Page 2/9
                                             Ainuddin Vs. Mahesh Jhalani &amp; Anr. 
</p>


<p id="p_7">  4.          Since none appeared on behalf of the respondent no. 1,
  therefore, respondent no. 1 was proceeded Ex-parte vide order dated
  21/02/2012. However, respondent no. 2 filed his reply to the petition
  raising preliminary objections that the suit property is situated in Slum
  area and no permission from Competent Authority (Slum) has been
  obtained, therefore, petition is not maintainable. The petition has been
  filed without and cause of action. There are 14 legal heirs of original
  landlord and they are the necessary parties but has not been impleaded.
  Petition has not been properly singed and verified and therefore, it is
  liable to be dismissed.
</p>

<p id="p_8">  5.          On merits, respondent No. 2 has denied the petitioner as
  landlord but admitted that he is the tenant. He further admitted that late
  Sh. Hazi Riazuddin, the father of the petitioner was the owner of the
  shop. He further denied that the other legal heirs have empowered the
  present petitioner by Power of Attorney to look after all the affairs of the
  suit shop and to collect the rent of the said shop. Further he admitted
  the rate of rent as Rs. 230/- per month. He denied any arrears of rent
  since January, 2005 till date. It is stated that the petitioner and other
  legal heirs of late Sh. Hazi Riazuddin have not been accepting the rent
  to create the ground of eviction and respondents have always been
  ready and willing to pay the rent but demand of rent @ Rs. 1500/- per
  month is illegal. Respondent has denied that there was any digging out
  the flooring or lowering down the floor level or extension of parchhati


E no. 273/2008                                                       Page 3/9

</p>
<p id="p_9">  adjacent to the roof. It is stated that suit shop is in the same position as
  it was let out to the respondent. There was no addition or alteration by
  the respondents. He denied the service of legal notice dated 01/08/2006
  or clarification dated 16/04/2007. It is prayed that since no cause of
  action, therefore, petition is liable to be dismissed.
</p>

<p id="p_10">  6.          Rejoinders to the reply was filed denying all the material
  objections as well as allegations on merits.
</p>

<p id="p_11">  7.          An order U/sec. 15 (1) of DRC Act was               passed on
  14/09/2010 directing the respondent to pay or deposit all the legally
  recoverable rent at the admitted rate of Rs. 230/- per month upto the
  month of September, 2010 within two months subject to furnishing of
  bank account number by petitioner.
</p>

<p id="p_12">  8.          Upon completion of the pleadings, petitioner examined
  himself as PW-1 by filing his affidavit in examination in chief deposing
  moreover the same facts as alleged in the petition and in support of his
  testimony, he has placed reliance upon the documents of which rent
  agreement dated 03/03/1989         as Ex. PW-1/1, Copy of Wapsi Patta
  dated 25/02/1989 as Ex. PW-1/2, Copy of three rent receipts as Ex.
  PW-1/3 (Colly), Copy of legal notice dated 01/08/2006 as Ex. PW-1/4,
  Copy of postal receipt and UPC receipt as Ex. PW-1/5 and PW-1/6, two
  returned registered envelopes containing the notice as Ex. PW-1/6 and
  PW-1/7, the copy of the clarification letter dated 16/04/2007 as Ex.

<p id="p_14">  PW-1/8, postal receipts thereof as Ex. PW-1/9, Returned registered
  envelope dated 17/04/2007 as Ex. PW-1/10, Copy of GPA dated
  18/04/2006 is marked as Mark- X, copy of GPA dated 27/10/2006 as
  Mark-Y and site plan as Ex. PW-1/13 and was cross examined at length.
</p>

<p id="p_15">  9.           Witness PW-2 Mr. Awdhesh Kr. Rai, Ahlmad was examined
  to prove the General Power of Attorney which was earlier marked as
  mark X and Y and same was exhibited as Ex. PW-2/A and PW-2/B.
</p>

<p id="p_16">  10.          Since none appeared on behalf of the respondent no. 2,
  therefore, he was proceeded Ex-parte on 21/02/2012.
</p>

<p id="p_17">  11.          I have given my thoughtful consideration to the submissions
  advanced on behalf of the petitioner     and have perused the record
  carefully.
</p>

<p id="p_18">  A.           The maintainability of the petition has been challenged on
  the ground that the suit property falls in Slum area and no permission
  has been obtained, therefore, the present petition is not maintainable.
  However, Ld. Predecessor Court even prior to issuing the notice has
  taken due care and examined one Mr. Manohar Lal, Surveyor, Office of
  Director (Town-Planning), Slum &amp; J.J. Deaprtment, Vikas Kutir, I.T.O.
  Delhi and he has clearly stated that the suit property does not fall in
  Slum area vide Gaz. Notification No. SRO 1252 dt. 10/04/1957.
  Otherwise also, the onus was upon the respondent to prove this fact but


E no. 273/2008                                                     Page 5/9
                                              Ainuddin Vs. Mahesh Jhalani &amp; Anr. 
</p>
<p id="p_19">  he has failed to discharge his onus. Thus, it can be safely held that suit
  property does not fall in the Slum area.
</p>

<p id="p_20">  B.           Maintainability of the present case has been further
  challenged on the ground that the petitioner is not the absolute owner
  and there is non joinder of the necessary parties i.e. other legal heirs of
  the original owner. There is no denial that petitioner is not one of the co-
  owner of the suit property or he is not one of the legal heir of the original
  owner. Thus, mere denial of his title is of no consequence.       Otherwise
  also, petitioner has proved on record that being the attorney of other
  legal heirs through Ex. PW-2/A and PW-2/B and he is competent to
  maintain the present petition. Thus, the petition can not be said to be
  bad for non joinder. It can be safely held that petitioner even being one
  of the co-owner/landlord has very right to maintain the present petition.
</p>

<p id="p_21">  C.           Maintainability of the present petition has been further
  challenged on the ground that main petition has not been duly signed
  and verified by the competent person. Perusal of the present petition
  shows that same has been signed but has not been verified by the
  applicant/petitioner or by recognized agent.
</p>

<p id="p_22">       ➔       In a petition U/s. 14 (1) (a) of the DRC Act, petitioner is
           required to prove that he is the landlord and respondent is
           the tenant, that respondent is in arrears of rent, that a legal
           notice of demand was sent and served and despite service


E no. 273/2008                                                        Page 6/9
                                               Ainuddin Vs. Mahesh Jhalani &amp; Anr. 
</p>
<p id="p_23">        of legal notice, respondent has failed to pay the arrears of
        rent within the stipulated period of two months.
</p>

<p id="p_24">   A.            So far as relationship of landlord and tenant is concerned
   that stands proved.
</p>

<p id="p_25">   B.            So far as arrears of rent is concerned, in the W.S. itself it
   has been mentioned that petitioner and other legal heirs of late Haji
   Riazuddin has not received rent though respondents have always
   been ready and willing to pay the rent.
</p>

<p id="p_26">   C.            So far as rate of rent is concerned, admittedly last rent
   was paid @ Rs. 230/- p.m.


   D.            So far as service of legal notice is concerned, admittedly
   said notice was sent at the suit shop address through registered post
   to both the respondents which was returned and a clarification of the
   legal notice was also sent through registered post which was also
   returned. The legal notice has been exhibited as Ex. PW-1/4 and
   postal receipt, returned envelope, clarification notice dt. 16/04/2007
   and returned envelope have been exhibited as Ex. PW-1/6 to
   PW-1/10. Nor a single suggestion has been given in the entire cross
   examination that the said notice was not sent at the correct address,
   thus, there is presumption of due service. However, validity of the
   legal notice has been challenged on the ground that legal notice is


E no. 273/2008                                                         Page 7/9
                                             Ainuddin Vs. Mahesh Jhalani &amp; Anr. 
</p>
<p id="p_27">   not valid as the rate of rent has been shown as Rs. 1500/- instead of
   Rs. 230/-. Perusal of the legal notice shows that the petitioner has
   demanded the rent @ Rs. 1500/- p.m. through legal demand notice
   from January 2004 which was clarified that rent was due from
   January 2005 vide clarification Ex. PW-1/8. Now it is settled law that
   the respondent is bound to comply the legal notice of demand atleast
   at the admitted rate which admittedly he has failed to comply. Thus, it
   stands proved on record that the respondent was in arrears of rent
   from January 2005 and despite service of legal notice of demand, he
   failed to comply with the same.
</p>

<p id="p_28">   E.            So far as petition U/Sec. 14 (1)(j) of D.R.C. Act is
   concerned, it has been alleged that the respondent has dig out the
   floor of the premises and made it 2 and ½ feet down from the level of
   the road and also extended the parchatti adjacent to the roof of the
   shop. However, in the rent agreement relied upon by the petitioner as
   Ex. PW-1/1, there is clear cut mention that the respondent is the
   tenant in respect of shop as well as pakki miani already in existence.
   There is no mention in entire petition that as to when there was
   digging in the suit shop. There is no such document on record to
   show that any complaint was made regarding the said unauthorised
   construction/digging in the suit shop. Thus, the petitioner has failed to
   prove the ground U/Sec. 14 (1)(j) of the D.R.C. Act.
</p>

<p id="p_29">   12.           In view of the aforesaid discussions, this Court is of the


E no. 273/2008                                                       Page 8/9
