ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">	The petitioner is a widow and a certificate to this effect has also been issued by the revenue authority on 12.9.2012. She has passed both SSLC and Higher Secondary Course from the Government Girls Higher Secondary School.  Her husband, who was a practising lawyer in Kallakurichi Court, suddenly died on 29.7.2012, leaving the petitioner to take care of the family responsibility. While so, in response to an advertisement issued by the respondents for the post of Noon Meal Organizer in Chinnasalem Panchayat Union during the year 2006, she applied as one of the eligible candidates.  Therefore, she was invited to take part in the interview.  Although the petitioner took part in the selection process, she was not considered. Hence the petitioner came to this Court with W.P.No.1779 of 2007 and this Court, by order dated 19.1.2001, disposed of the same giving liberty to the petitioner to take part in the fresh selection process in the nearby village. On the basis of the said order, the petitioner also applied on 4.6.2012.   Again the petitioner was not considered.  In the meanwhile, the third respondent  issued a communication dated 19.1.2017 directing the petitioner to appear for interview on 31.1.2017 along with all original certificates.  Accordingly, she appeared for the interview on 31.1.2017 and submitted all the original certificates. But the third respondent, after verifying the certificates, returned the same and thereafter there was no response from the respondents about her selection or non-selection.  After waiting for a long time, she has given a representation requesting to provide her a job on priority basis.  But there is no response.  Therefore, the petitioner has come to this Court seeking a direction to the respondents to consider her as a preferential candidate.
</p>
<p id="p_2">	2. Mr.M.Dig Vijaya Pandian, learned Additional Government Pleader, taking notice on behalf of the first and second respondents, and Mr.K.Balamurugan, learned Government Advocate, taking notice on  behalf of the third respondent, sought time to consider the pending representation.  
</p>
<p id="p_3">	3. The petitioner is admittedly a widow, as she lost her husband on 29.7.2012. Although many times she appeared for the interview for the post of Noon Meal Organizer, it is not known why her candidature was not considered.  In any event, since she had appeared for the post of Noon Meal Organizer in response to the communication issued by the third respondent dated 19.1.2017, the respondents are directed to consider her case on priority basis, considering the certificate issued by the revenue authority and all other relevant documents, before finalising the selection of candidates for the said post.   With this observation, the writ petition stands disposed of.  No costs.
