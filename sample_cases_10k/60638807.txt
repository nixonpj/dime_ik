IN    THE     HIGH    COURT          OF        JHARKHAND                AT   RANCHI


                      L.P.A. No. 75 of 2013

     Gazi Safdar Hayat Khan .....             ...            ....   Appellant

                           Vs.

 1. The State of Jharkhand
 2. The Superintendent of Police, Hazaribagh
 3. The Secretary, Finance, Govt. of Jharhand
 4. The Accountant General of Jharkhand
 5. The D.I.G. Budget      ....     ...       ...     ...     ... Respondents
                                    ------
CORAM: HON'BLE THE CHIEF JUSTICE.
     HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE SHREE CHANDRASHEKHAR
                  ------

     For the Appellant:        Mr. Awanish R. Mishra, Advocate
     For the Respondent:        J.C to A.G.
     for the Accountant General: Mr. S. Srivastava, Advocate
                               ------
                           ------                   Dated 10th February, 2014


                      The present appeal is preferred against the

         order dated 11.09.2012 passed in W.P. (S) No. 4864 of

         2012 whereby the writ petition filed by the appellant was

         dismissed mainly on the ground of latches and inordinate

         unexplained delay.

         2.           The appellant was recruited as Constable in

         the Department of Police in the year 1968                            i.e. on

         7.11.1968</pre><p id="p_1">.    After      joining,          the     appellant    passed   the

         matriculation examination in the year 1970, wherein his

         date of birth was recorded as 7.06.1950. Thereafter, the

         appellant was selected as Writer Constable in the year
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                          2</span>


1974-75. The appellant was promoted as Assistant Sub-

Inspector on 1.4.1981 and finally he was promoted on the

post of Sub-Inspector on 20.08.1994.
</p>
<p id="p_2">3.          By    Memo   No.   4894    dated       24.12.2009

(Annexure 11), the appellant was informed that as per his

date of birth 7.6.1950, as mentioned in the service book,

he is going to retire on 30.6.2010. However, an audit

objection was raised regarding date of birth of the

appellant and it was alleged that date of birth of the

appellant was manipulated and audit objection was raised

that his date of birth dated 7.6.1950 was stated to be a

wrong entry. Based on the said audit objection, vide

Annexure-2,      dated   18.5.2010,    the     appellant   was

suspended on the ground that he had manipulated his

date of birth. Vide Memo No. 2228 dated 30.5.2010

(Annexure 3) charges were framed against the appellant.

Vide Memo No. 2268 dated 31.5.2010 (Annexure 4), the

appellant was ordered to be retired from 30.11.2007 by

considering his age as 21 years as on 7.11.1968 when the

appellant entered into service. By Memo No. 3818 dated

25.6.2012 (Annexure 13), an order was passed for

recovery of the amount paid to the appellant between the

period December, 2007 and 30th April, 2010 and it was

also ordered that recovery would be made form Gratuity/

Provident Fund/ Leave Encashment and other retiral

benefits of the appellants.

</p><p id="p_4">4.          Being aggrieved by the order under which the

appellant was made to retire with effect from 30.11.2007,

the appellant has filed W.P.(S) No. 4864 of 2012 seeking

direction that his correct date of birth be treated as

7.6.1950.
</p>
<p id="p_5">5.          Pointing out that the order dated 31.5.2010 in

and by which the appellant was ordered to be retired with

effect from 30.11.2007 was challenged after two years in

the year 2012, the learned Single Judge dismissed the writ

petition on the principle of latches and inordinate

unexplained delay.
</p>
<p id="p_6">6.          Being aggrieved by the dismissal of the writ

petition, being W.P.(S) No. 4864 of 2012, the appellant

has filed this Letters Patent Appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_7">7.          We    have   heard   Mr.    Awanish   R.    Mishra,

learned counsel appearing for the appellant. We have also

heard   learned   counsel    appearing    for   the    State   of

Jharkhand and Mr. S. Srivastava, for the Accountant

General of Jharkhand.
</p>
<p id="p_8">8.          By perusal of Annexure-2 dated 18.05.2010, it

is seen that at the time when the appellant entered the

service, his date of birth as on 7.11.1968 was recorded as

21 years, which means that the appellant's date of birth

was then recorded as 1947. Subsequently when the

appellant passed the matriculation examination in 1970,

he has given his date of birth as 7.6.1950 and he has
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                            4</span>


produced the matriculation certificate stating that his

date of birth is 7.6.1950. If the matriculation certificate is

to be taken into account, when the appellant entered into

service in 1968, he could not have completed the 21 years

of age. Such change in the date of birth as 7.6.1950 is not

supported by any authentic document. The said date of

birth 7.6.1950 also does not tally with the age of the

appellant recorded in the Service Register when he

entered the service.
</p>
<p id="p_9">9.          As pointed out by learned counsel for the

respondent nos. 1 and 2, the appellant has not produced

any document to show that his date of birth is 7.6.1950. In

this regard, learned counsel appearing for the State has

drawn    our   attention       to   letter   dated   9.4.2011   of

Headmaster, Raj Senior Secondary School, Darbhanga,

(Annexure-8 series) whereby the School has intimated the

Superintendent of Police, Hazaribagh that the concerned

record of the appellant was not available in the school.

Learned counsel for the State further stated that the

appellant   himself    had      vide   letter   dated   19.7.2010

(Annexure C filed along with counter affidavit) given

statement in writing accepting that his date of retirement

may be taken as 30.11.2007.
</p>
<p id="p_10">10.         In these facts and circumstances, when the

appellant has not produced any documentary evidence to

show that his correct date of birth is 7.6.1950 before the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                              5</span>


authority, the contention of the appellant that he was

forcibly    retired    on   30.11.2007    cannot       be   accepted.

Equally there is no merit in the contention of the appellant

that the correct date of birth to be treated as 7.6.1950.

 Since the appellant himself gave statement in writing

that his date of retirement be taken 30.11.2007 the

appellant cannot contend that his age be taken as

7.6.1950. We do not find any error in the impugned order

(Annexure 4 dated 31.5.2010).
</p>
<p id="p_11">11.            In so far as the order of recovery dated

24.6.2012 (Annexure 13) ordering recovery of the salary

for the period between December, 2007 and 30th April,

2010, learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the

appellant    had      worked     during   the   said    period   and

therefore, the appellant is entitled for the salary and

sought for appropriate direction to the respondents not to

deduct the salary amount for the said period between

December, 2007and April, 2010. In this regard, learned

counsel for the appellant has also drawn our attention to

the appellant's representation dated 26.5.2012 (Annexure

</p><p id="p_12">10) whereby he has prayed for payment of gratuity etc.

</p><p id="p_13">12.           Even though the order of recovery is now not

under challenge before this Court, considering the fact

that the appellant had worked for the period between

December, 2007 and April, 2010, we deem it appropriate

that suitable direction be issued to respondent no. 2.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                      6</span>


</p><p id="p_14">            13.              We direct the 2nd respondent to consider

            the representation of the appellant dated 25.6.2012

            sympathetically keeping in view that he had worked

            between December, 2007 and April, 2010.

</p><p id="p_15">            14.        With the above directions and observations,

            this Letters Patent Appeal is disposed of.



</p><p id="p_16">                                                 (R. Banumathi, C.J.)
