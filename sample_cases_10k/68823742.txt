08       IN THE HIGH COURT OF JUDICATURE FOR
                RAJASTHAN AT JODHPUR
      --------------------------------------------------------

           CRIMINAL APPEAL (CRLA) No. 323 of 1990

                        STATE OF RAJASTHAN
                              VS
                          RATNARAM


         Date of Order                 :        22.09.2016


               HON'BLE MS. NIRMALJIT KAUR,J.

     Mr. K.K. Rawal, Public Prosecutor, for the State

                               ORDER
</pre><p id="p_1">                                -----
</p>
<p id="p_2">          This is an appeal under Section 378(iii) and (I)

     <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_1">Cr.P.C</a>. against the judgment dated 02-06-1990 passed

     by Sessions Judge Jalore in Session Case No. 19/88

     vide which the respondent was acquitted of the charges

     levelled against him.
</p>
<p id="p_3">          As per the prosecution story, on 04.04.1988 SHO

     Police Station Bagoda Shri Devi Singh was informed by

     head constable Narayan Singh, incharge of Police

     Chowki Narsana that he has been informed about the

     involvement of the present respondent in the business

     of opium and that the said accused person has brought

     opium milk on 03.04.1988, which he is likely to sell

     from his Dhani.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                 2</span><p id="p_4">

     Accordingly, Pw-2 S.H.O. Devi Singh, Pw-5 A.S.I.

Guman Singh along with Ganga Ram and Jog Singh

went to Police Chowki Narsana from where they took

with them Jabbar Singh, head constable-Poonmaram

along with one witness Modsingh as well as one Rama

for the search. On search they found the 01kg and 100

gms of opium lying in the mud-utensil in the said

premises. The person of accused-respondent was also

searched and 70 gms opium was found from pocket of

his shirt.     After investigation the challan was filed

under <a href="/doc/704277/" id="a_2">Section 8</a>/<a href="/doc/325366/" id="a_3">18</a> NDPS Act.
</p>
<p id="p_5">     As many as 08 witnesses were produced by the

prosecution.       After   conclusion    of   the   trial   the

respondent was acquitted of the charges levelled

against him.
</p>
<p id="p_6">     While praying for setting aside the impugned

order, learned counsel for the State submitted that

during the recovery, some material and instruments

were found which shows that the respondent indulged

in converting the opium milk into opium before selling

and that the respondent had no explanation to offer.

Hence, the acquittal of the respondent cannot stand.

Secondly,    the     recovery   having   been   proved,     the

respondent cannot be acquitted on account of sheer
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                              3</span>

technicalities.
</p>
<p id="p_7">     Heard.
</p>
<p id="p_8">     While acquitting the accused respondent, the

learned Court below took into consideration the non

compliance of <a href="/doc/1841395/" id="a_4">Sections 42</a>, <a href="/doc/1158106/" id="a_5">42(2)</a>, <a href="/doc/1609866/" id="a_6">51</a>, <a href="/doc/1284622/" id="a_7">52(2)</a> as well as

55 and 57 of the <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_8">NDPS Act</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_9">     It is admitted by PW-2 Devi Singh -Investigating

Officer in his cross-examination that no information

was sent by him to the senior officer as recorded under

<a href="/doc/1841395/" id="a_9">Section 42</a> of the NDPS Act, which is fatal to the case.

Although, PW-2 the investigation officer has stated that

he had recorded the information in writing but no such

writing has been produced or exhibited. Similarly, the

said information was not sent to the immediate official

superior as required. Thus, <a href="/doc/855593/" id="a_10">Section 42(1)</a> and (2) has

not been complied. As per the well settled proposition

of law, compliance     of <a href="/doc/855593/" id="a_11">Section 42(1)</a> and (2) is

mandatory. The search was on prior information and

the investigating officer had sufficient time to record

the information and also send the same to the higher

official but the same was not done.
</p>
<p id="p_10">     Further, 70 gms opium was searched from the

person of the accused-respondent. Before the search is

conducted on the person of an accused, it is mandatory
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                            4</span>

                to inform the accused of his right to be searched before

                the Gazzette   officer or the Magistrate. It is evident

                from the statement of the investigating officer that

                there was total non-compliance of <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_12">Section 50</a> of the

                NDPS Act. The accused was not informed of any of his

                right and nor was allowed to exercise his option.

</p><p id="p_11">                     Both the recovery witnesses PW-4 Rama and PW-

                7 Modsingh have turned hostile. Thus, rendering the

                very recovery doubtful.
</p>
<p id="p_12">                     In view of the above, this Court finds no ground to

                interfere in the order and judgement dated 02.06.1990

                acquitting the respondent-accused.

</p><p id="p_13">                     Dismissed accordingly.
