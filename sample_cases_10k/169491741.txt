not to erect tower and transmission line in the petitioners patta land
situated at Viralipatti Village, Nilakkottai Taluk, Dindigul District on the
basis of the representation of the petitioners dated 15.12.2017.

notice for the respondents 1, 3 and 4, Mr.K.Sekar, learned Standing Counsel
takes notice for the second respondent and Mr.E.P.Venkateshwar, learned 
counsel for Mr.S.M.S.Johnny Basha takes notice for the respondents 5 and 6.
</p>
        
<p id="p_6">        3.It is the case of the petitioners that the petitioners are the owners
of 5.47 and 6.22 acres of agricultural lands with 150 and 48 coconut trees on
it in Survey Nos.957/1, 957/2B, 1005/2B &amp; 1005/5C and 998, 999/2, 997/1,
997/2, 1000/2B and 1001/4A, respectively situated at Viralipatti Village,
Nilakottai Taluk, Dindigul District.
</p>
<p id="p_7">        4.According to the petitioners, the second respondent which is a
Central Government undertaking is laying High Tension Transmission Power 
Lines over the petitioners property.  By laying the lines, according to the
petitioners, the coconut trees in the property will have to be uprooted which
will cause heavy loss and hardship to the petitioners.  Therefore, the
petitioners had given a representation to all the respondents on 15.12.2017
requesting the respondents that without paying adequate compensation, the
respondents should not lay the High Tension Transmission Power Lines over
their agricultural property.
</p>
<p id="p_8">        5.Learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that despite receipt of
the said representation, no reply was sent by the respondents. He would
further submit that no show cause notice has been received by the petitioners
till date.  The learned counsel for the petitioners drew the attention of
this Court to <a href="/doc/1866179/" id="a_3">Section 10</a> of the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885, which reads as
follows:
</p><p id="p_9">        ?10.Power for telegraph authority to place and maintain telegraph lines
and posts.?The telegraph authority may, from time to time, place and maintain
a telegraph line under, over, along, or across, and posts in or upon any
immovable property:
</p><p id="p_10">        Provided that? (a) the telegraph authority shall not exercise the
powers conferred by this section except for the purposes of a telegraph
established or maintained by the [Central Government], or to be so
established or maintained;
</p><p id="p_11">        (b) the [Central Government] shall not acquire any right other than
that of user only in the property under, over, along, across in or upon which
the telegraph authority places any telegraph line or post; and
</p><p id="p_12">         (c) except as hereinafter provided, the telegraph authority shall not
exercise those powers in respect of any property vested in or under the
control or management of any local authority, without the permission of that
authority;
</p><p id="p_13">        and (d) in the exercise of the powers conferred by this section, the
telegraph authority shall do as little damage as possible, and, when it has
exercised those powers in respect of any property other than that referred to
in clause (c), shall pay full compensation to all persons interested for any
damage sustained by them by reason of the exercise of those powers.? 
</p>
<p id="p_14">        6.According to the petitioners, the respondents have not adhered to the
principles of natural justice by issuing prior show cause notice before
laying the High Tension Transmission Power Lines over the property of the
petitioners.
</p>
<p id="p_15">        7.Per contra, learned Standing Counsel for the second respondent would
submit that the High Tension Transmission Power Lines have to be laid over
the property belonging to the petitioners as well as adjoining lands for the
purpose of Tamil Nadu Solar Power Project which is a venture of the Central
Government.  Under the said project, power is generated by the second
respondent and given to the fifth and sixth respondents.
</p>
<p id="p_16">        8.Admittedly, there is no written reply given by the respondents to the
representation dated 15.12.2017 given by the petitioners.  Even though, as
seen from the provisions of the <a href="/doc/357830/" id="a_4">Indian Telegraph Act</a>, 1885, there is no
necessity to give prior notice before laying High Tension Transmission Power
Lines over the property of the petitioners. Therefore, this Court is of the
view that the respondents should have given a written reply to the
representation dated 15.12.2017 sent by the petitioners.
</p>
<p id="p_17">        9.Considering the facts and circumstances of the case, this Court is of
the considered view that the District Collector, Dindigul District, the third
respondent herein, who is the deciding authority shall dispose of the
representation of the petitioners, dated 15.12.2017 within a period of one
week from today by giving ample opportunity to the petitioners by way of
submission of documents in support of their stand and also giving them a
personal hearing and pass final orders on merits and in accordance with law.
Till the disposal of the representation given by the petitioners dated
15.12.2017, the respondents shall not lay the High Tension Transmission Power
Lines over the property of the petitioners.
</p>

<p id="p_18">        10.Accordingly, the Writ Petitions are disposed of. However, there
shall be no order as to costs.  Consequently, W.M.P.(MD)Nos.20325 and 20326  
of 2017 are closed.
