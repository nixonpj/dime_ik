CAV on 10/05/2017                                       Pronounced on 13/09/2017
Per Pramath Patnaik, J.

           In the accompanied writ application, the petitioner has interalia prayed

     for quashing/cancelling/rescinding the notices dated 16.06.2016 issued by the

     respondent no.3 vide Annexure-6 &amp; 6/A whereby the petitioner has been

     asked to show cause as to why an action be not taken against him under Rule

     43(a) of Pension Rules due to conviction on 29.01.2011 in R.C. 49(A)/96 and

     on 31.01.2012 in R.C. 35(A) 96 and the petitioner has further prayed for
 issuance of writ of mandamus commanding/restraining the respondents from

interfering with the payment of pension/pensionary benefits to the petitioner.

2.    Sans unnecessary details the facts as disclosed in the writ application is

that while the petitioner was continuing as Joint Regional Director, Animal

Husbandry, Ranchi under the Regional Director, several cases were instituted

against several persons on the ground of alleged involvement in scam of the

Animal Husbandry Department and the matter was referred for investigation

to C.B.I. during that period. The petitioner retired after attaining the age of

superannuation on 29.02.1996. After retirement, the petitioner applied for

retiral dues. Due to delay in payment of retiral dues, the petitioner filed

C.W.J.C. No.1617 of 1997(R) and the said writ petition was disposed of on

29.04.1998</pre><p id="p_1"> directing the respondents for payment of retiral dues of the

petitioner. Being aggrieved by the said order, the respondents filed L.P.A.

No.356 of 1998 which was dismissed on 28.01.2001. Review application

being Civil Review No.19 of 2001 filed by the respondents was disposed of

on 03.12.2001 directing the respondents to release the payment within one

month. Thereafter, the petitioner was granted pension. In the month of July,

2009 order dated 24.10.2008 was issued by Joint Secretary for stopping the

payment of pension of the petitioner on the ground of conviction on

07.08.2006 in R.C.3 (A) of 2001(R) as evident from Annexure-1 to the writ

petition. Being aggrieved by the order dated 24.10.2008 relating to stoppage

of pension, the petitioner filed W.P.(S) No.3349 of 2009 which was allowed

on 27.11.2012 by remanding back to the respondents. The petitioner being

not satisfied with the said judgment dated 27.11.2012 passed in W.P.(S) 3349

of 2009 filed L.P.A. No.525 of 2012 which was allowed on 16.01.2013 as per

Annexure-3 to the writ petition. The respondents-State of Bihar being not
 satisfied with the judgment passed by this Court moved in Special Leave to

Appeal before Hon'ble Apex Court which was heard and dismissed by order

dated 23.09.2013 vide Annexure-4 to the writ petition. Since, despite the

order passed by this Court and Hon'ble Apex Court, pension was not paid, the

petitioner filed Contempt Case (Civil) No.495 of 2013 which was disposed of

on 23.01.2014 and thereafter, the respondents started paying pension of the

petitioner. While getting the pension, the respondents issued show cause

notices dated 16.06.2016 to the petitioner as to why action be not taken

against him under Rule 43(a) of the Pension Rule, which has been issued to

the petitioner on the basis of his conviction on 29.01.2011 and 31.01.2012 in

connection with R.C. Case No.49(A)/96 and R.C. Case No.35(A) 96. Being

aggrieved by the aforesaid notice of show cause vide Annexure-6 and 6/A of

the writ application, the petitioner left with no other alternative, efficacious

and speedy remedy has knocked the door of this Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1">Article 226</a> of

the Constitution of India for redressal of his grievance.

</p><p id="p_2">3.    Learned senior counsel for the petitioner has strenuously urged that the

action of the respondents is not justified in issuing the impugned show cause

notices against the petitioner under Rule 43(a) of the Pension Rule, since the

petitioner attained the age of superannuation on 29.02.1996 and after

retirement the employer - employee relationship ceased therefore, the

respondent could not have been invoked the provision of the Rule 43 (a) of

the Pension Rule on the ground of alleged misconduct. Learned senior

counsel further submits that the respondents have time and again resorted to

taking action for stoppage of pensions despite the order passed by this Court

and Hon'ble Apex Court, when there has been no substantial change of facts

and situation. Learned senior counsel further submits that the action of the
 respondent is assailable on the ground that the conviction of the petitioner in

criminal cases which pertain to an incident said to have been taken place

prior to his retirement i.e. on 29.02.1996 and against the order of conviction,

the petitioner has also preferred appeal which is pending before this Hon'ble

Court. Therefore, the action of the respondent in issuing impugned show

cause notice is illegal, malafide in law and without jurisdiction, thereby

violative of <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_2">Article-21</a> of the Constitution of India.
</p>
<p id="p_3">4.    Learned senior counsel for the petitioner during course of hearing has

referred to the supplementary affidavit dated 28.04.2017 wherein the

respondents have tried to defend the action on the basis of Rules 43(a) and

43(b) of the Pension Rules by making clear statement in paragraphs 6, 14 and

20 of the counter and Annexure-A attached to said counter-affidavit. The

copy of the counter-affidavit filed by State of Bihar in W.P.(S) No.3349 of

2009 has been as Annexure-A to the said affidavit as per Annexure-8 of main

application. Therefore, now the respondents cannot justify and defend the

impugned act/action on the basis of Rule 43(a) or 43(b) of Pension Rules in

view of principle of resjudicata or Constructive resjudicata.

</p><p id="p_4">5.    Controverting the averment made in the writ application, a counter-

affidavit has been filed by respondent no.2 and 3 (State of Bihar). In the

counter-affidavit, it has been stated that the petitioner has already been

convicted by the learned Special Court, CBI Ranchi in four separate Animal

Husbandry Scam Cases/Trials, firstly in R.C. No.3(A)/2001, relating to

Palamu Treasury, by a judgment dated 07.08.2006, secondly in R.C.

No.31(A)/96 relating to Doranda Treasury by a judgment dated 07.05.2012,

thirdly in R.C. 35 (A)/96, relating to Doranda Treasury by judgment dated

31.01.2012 and fourthly in R.C.39(A)/96, relating to Chaibasa Treasury by a
 judgment dated 29.01.2011. It has further been submitted that the fate of

similarly situated officers of Animal Husbandry Department, Government of

Bihar namely Bajrangdeo Narayan Sinha, Retired Touring Veterinary Officer

and Harendra Nath Verma, Retired Reserved Veterinary Officer who have

also similarly been convicted by the learned Special Court, C.B.I., Ranchi in

R.C. 45(A)/1996 by a judgment and order of conviction dated 25.09.2006 and

in R.C. 40(A)/96 dated 26.09.1996 respectively and subsequent to pension

has also similarly been stopped and aggrieved by the said decision the writ

petition bearing C.W.J.C. No.13323/2009 and C.W.J.C. No.13795/2009 were

filed before the Hon'ble Patna High Court and the said writ petitions were

dismissed on 05.04.2012 by the Hon'ble Patna High Court by a well

considered judgment on the law laid down by the Hon'ble Apex Court which

has been annexed as Annexure-A to the counter-affidavit and it has further

been submitted that aforesaid order dated 05.04.2012 passed by the Hon'ble

Patna High Court in the case of Bajarangdeo Narayan Sinha and Hamendra

Nath Verma have been confirmed in L.P.A. No.919 of 2012 and L.P.A.

No.815 of 2012 vide Annexure-B to the counter-affidavit. It has further been

submitted in the counter-affidavit that Rule 43(a) of the Bihar Pension Rules

has been quoted. It has further been submitted that the petitioner filed another

writ application bearing W.P.(S) No.2701 of 2016, challenging impugned

notice issued under the Rule 43(a) of Bihar Pension Rule subsequent to

conviction in R.C. 31A/1996.
</p>
<p id="p_5">6.    Learned counsel for the State of Bihar has reiterated the submissions

made in the counter-affidavit. During the pendency of the writ application,

the order dated 02.03.2017 for stoppage the payment of pension and gratuity

to the petitioner has been passed vide order dated 22.03.2017 and in I.A.
 No.2246 of 2017 this Court has been pleased to direct for staying the

operation/implementation/enforcement of the order contained in Annexure-7

resolution dated 02.03.2017. Accordingly, I.A. No.2246 of 2017 has been

allowed and disposed of.
</p>
<p id="p_6">7. After giving my anxious consideration to the rivalized submissions and on

perusal of the relevant documents, the petitioner has not been able to make

out a case for interference due to the following facts and reasons stated

hereinbelow:-
</p>
<p id="p_7">(I)    That admittedly, due to conviction of the petitioner in four separate

scam cases impugned show cause notices have been issued vide memo dated

16.06.2016 vide Annexure-6 &amp; 6/A whereby the petitioner has been asked to

explain his grave misconduct due to his conviction. During the pendency of

the writ application, the order dated 02.03.2017 for stoppage the payment of

pension and gratuity to the petitioner has been passed which has been

challenged in I.A. No.2246 of 2017 (Annexure-7). The said order has been

passed after obtaining concurrence of Jharkhand Public Service Commission.

(II)   For better appreciation, it would be apposite to refer Rule 43 (a) of the

Bihar Pension Rules reads as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">         "Future Good Conduct is an implied condition of every grant of
         pension. The Provincial Government reserve to themselves the
         right of withholding or withdrawing a pension or any part of it, if
         the pensioner is convicted of serious crime or be guilty of grave
         misconduct. The decision of the Provincial Government on any
         question of withholding or withdrawing the whole or any part of
         a pension under this rule, shall be final and conclusive."</blockquote><p id="p_8">


</p><p id="p_9">       Therefore, it is quite apparent that the aforesaid provision

unequivocally and in clear and categorical term enables the State to withhold

entire pension or any part of it if the petitioner is convicted of serious crime
           or held guilty of grave misconduct. In the present case, the petitioner

          admittedly has been convicted of serious crime in four criminal cases by the

          learned court of Special Judge, CBI Ranchi. The seminal point hinges upon

          Rule 43 (a) of the Bihar Pension Rule. According to Rule 27 of Jharkhand

          Pension Rules, pension includes gratuity. Therefore, in the light of aforesaid

          facts, the State of Bihar is within its right to direct for stoppage of pension

          under Rule 43 (a) of the Bihar Pension Rule. Therefore, there is absolutely no

          infirmity or illegality in the impugned show cause notice dated 16.06.2016

          vide Annexure-6 &amp; 6/A of the writ application and order dated 02.03.2017

          passed by Animal Husbandry &amp; Fisheries Department, the State of Bihar. If

          the petitioner ultimately gets acquitted in the pending appeals, in that

          eventuality the respondent authority would reexamine impugned order and

          take appropriate action in accordance with law.
</p>
<p id="p_10">          8.    On cumulative effect of the facts and reasons and as a logical sequitur

          to the factual assertions made in the foregoing paragraph, the show cause

          notice vide Annexure-6 &amp; 6/A to the writ application and order dated

          02.03.2017 vide Annexure-7 to I.A. No.2246 of 2017 do not warrant any

          interference by this Court.
</p>
<p id="p_11">          9.    Accordingly, the writ petition is dismissed being devoid of any merit.
