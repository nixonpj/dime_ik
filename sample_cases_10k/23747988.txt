                                              M.Cr.C. No.10285/2014

             (Jitendra alias Jeetu Vs. State of MP)
05.11.2014
        Shri BPS Chauhan, Advocate for applicant.
        Shri Mukund Bharadwaj, Government Advocate for
Respondent/State.</pre>
<p id="p_1">        Case Diary is perused.
</p><p id="p_2">        Learned counsel for the rival parties are heard.
        The applicant has filed this third application u/S 439,
<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_1">Cr.P.C</a>. for grant of bail after rejection of the earlier one on
merits. The applicant has been arrested on 08.10.2013 by Police
Station Dehat Ashoknagar, District Ashoknagar in connection
with Crime No.54/2013 registered in relation to the offences
punishable u/Ss. 304B, 498A and 201/34 of <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_2">IPC</a>.
</p><p id="p_3">        Learned Public Prosecutor for the State opposed the
application and prayed for its rejection by contending that on the
basis of the allegations and the material available on record, no
case for grant of bail is made out.
</p><p id="p_4">        The new ground raised herein is recording of the
statements of parents of the deceased, namely, Badri Prasad
(PW1) and Sunita (PW2) on 15.10.2014. Both these principal
witnesses have turned hostile and have not supported the story
of the prosecution that the applicant, who is husband, has
inflicted dowry demand related cruelty.
</p><p id="p_5">        Considering the above facts and that the early conclusion
of the trial is a bleak possibility and prolonged pre-trial detention
is anathema to the concept of liberty and that there are no
criminal antecedents of the applicant and the material placed on
record does not disclose possibility of the applicant fleeing from
justice, this Court is inclined to extend the benefit of bail to the
applicant.
</p><p id="p_6">        Accordingly, this application is allowed and it is directed
that the applicant be released on bail on furnishing a personal
bond in the sum of Rs.1,00,000/- (Rs. One Lac only) with two
solvent sureties, each of Rs.50,000/-, to the satisfaction of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                                   2</span>

            concerned Trial Court.
</p><p id="p_7">                   This order will remain operative subject to compliance of
            the following conditions by the applicant :-
</p><p id="p_8">               1. The applicant will comply with all the terms and conditions of the
                  bond executed by him;
</p><p id="p_9">               2. The applicant will cooperate in the investigation/trial, as the case may
                  be;
</p><p id="p_10">               3. The applicant will not indulge himself in extending inducement,
                  threat or promise to any person acquainted with the facts of the case
                  so as to dissuade him/her from disclosing such facts to the Court or to
                  the Police Officer, as the case may be;
</p><p id="p_11">               4. The applicant shall not commit an offence similar to the offence of
                  which he is accused;
</p><p id="p_12">               5. The applicant will not seek unnecessary adjournments during the
                  trial; and
</p><p id="p_13">               6. The applicant will not leave India without previous permission of the
                  trial Court/Investigating Officer, as the case may be.
                 A copy of this order be sent to the Court concerned for
            compliance.
</p><p id="p_14">                 C.c. as per rules.
