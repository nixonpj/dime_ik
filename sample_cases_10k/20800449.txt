<pre id="pre_1">HONOURABLE SRI JUSTICE ABHINAND KUMAR SHAVILI

                 WRIT PETITION No.23100 OF 2004
ORDER:
</pre>
<p id="p_1">        This writ petition is filed seeking a Writ of Mandamus

declaring proceedings No.DM/BHEL Letter No.01/2 (10)/98-HCR,

dated 02.07.1998 and Award, dated 01.08.2002, passed by respondent

No.3 in I.D.No.116 of 1999 in so far as not granting back wages and

also imposing of punishment of stoppage of two annual grade

increments with cumulative effect as illegal and arbitrary.


</p><p id="p_2">        2.   Heard Sri P. Raghavender Reddy, learned counsel for

petitioner, Sri V.T.M. Prasad, learned standing counsel for

Corporation appearing on behalf of respondent Nos.1 and 2, and the

learned Government Pleader for Labour appearing for respondent

No.3.
</p>
<p id="p_3">
</p><p id="p_4">        3.   The brief facts are that the petitioner was appointed as

Driver in respondent's Corporation on 08.02.1978 and his services

were regularized on 31.07.1979; that on 02.05.1995, while driving the

bus bearing No.AEZ 1998 on the route from Koti to Patancheruv in

the last trip at 9.45 p.m., he alleged to have caused an accident and

thereupon, the respondent Corporation had initiated disciplinary

proceedings against him alleging misconduct. After conducting

regular enquiry, the petitioner was removed from service vide

proceedings, dated 02.07.1998. Challenging the said order, the
                                   2                                AKS, J
                                                      W.P.No.23100 of 2004




petitioner preferred an appeal and the appellate authority rejected the

same. Aggrieved by the same, the petitioner preferred I.D.No.116 of

1999 under Section 2-A (2) of <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_1">Industrial Disputes Act</a>, 1947. By

Award, dated 01.08.2002, the Industrial Tribunal was pleased to set

aside the order of removal and directed the respondent Corporation to

reinstate the petitioner with continuity of service and denied back

wages and also ordered stoppage of two annual increments with

cumulative effect. But, the respondent Corporation imposed the

punishment of withholding of two increments with cumulative effect

and not granting back-wages. Challenging the same, the petitioner

filed the present writ petition only to the extent of denying the back

wages and withholding of two increments with cumulative effect.


</p><p id="p_5">      4. The learned counsel for the petitioner contended that the

Tribunal ought not to have ordered for stoppage of two annual

increments with cumulative effect and also ought not to have denied

the back wages and further contended that the petitioner is also

entitled for back-wages.
</p>
<p id="p_6">
</p><p id="p_7">      5.    The learned Standing Counsel for the respondent

Corporation contended that since the Tribunal had modified the major

punishment of removal to that of withholding of two increments with

cumulative effect, it should be understood that another major penalty

of withholding of two increments with cumulative effect has been

imposed by the Tribunal and accordingly, the Corporation had
                                      3                             AKS, J
                                                      W.P.No.23100 of 2004




imposed the punishment of withholding of two increments with

cumulative effect.
</p>
<p id="p_8">
</p><p id="p_9">      6. Having considered the rival contentions of the parties, this

Court is of the considered view that when the Tribunal modified the

punishment of removal to that of withholding of two increments with

cumulative effect, the same has to be modified to that of without

cumulative effect.
</p>
<p id="p_10">
</p><p id="p_11">      7. In view of the above, the Writ Petition is allowed in part to

the extent of withholding of two increments without cumulative effect

and the respondent's Corporation is directed to grant notional benefits

to the petitioner without any monetary benefits. No order as to costs.


</p><p id="p_12">      As a sequel, Miscellaneous Petitions, if any, pending in this

writ petition shall stand closed.
