                          The Assessee has filed this Appeal raising the following purported

                 questions of law arising from the order of the learned Tribunal dated 9.4.2018

                 whereby the Assessee's Appeal came to be dismissed by the learned Tribunal

                 upholding the order passed by the learned Commissioner of Income Tax

                 (Appeals) for the Assessment Year 2014-2015.
</p>
<p id="p_2">                           "i) Whether, on the facts and in the circumstances of the

                           case, the Tribunal was right in confirming the addition when

                           the Assessee had discharged its onus of proving the

                           genuineness of the transactions by producing the bank

                           statements of both parties?
</p>
<p id="p_3">                           ii) Whether the order of the Tribunal is based on a perverse

                           finding of fact that the whereabouts of the appellant's

                           brother in law are not known, when the Revenue has neither

                           summoned the brother in law under <a href="/doc/727816/" id="a_2">Section 131</a> of the Act

                           nor called for any confirmation letter from him?

</p><p id="p_4">                           iii) Whether, on the facts and in the circumstances of the

                           case, the Tribunal was right in treating the amounts

                           transferred to the appellant as unexplained cash credit

                           merely because the bank account of the transferor was not

                           designated as an NRI Account?"
</p>
<p id="p_5">                          2. The ground on which the Assessee lost before the two Appellate

                 Authorities is that the Assessee could not prove the Cash Credit in the name of

                 Bhuma Ramakrishna Reddy, the brother in law of the Assesssee, who was

                 engaged in the construction business and who is said to be a Software Engineer

                 and an NRI, who maintained a Bank Account with ICICI Bank and it is from such

                 Bank Account only the advances were made to the Assessee, but, since the

                 Assessee could not produce the said Bhuma Ramakrishna Reddy, an adverse

                 inference was drawn by the Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals)            and

                 additions made by the Assessing Officer were confirmed.

</p><p id="p_6">                          3. Mrs.J.Sreevidya, the learned counsel appearing for the Assessee has

                 urged before us that the said person could not be produced as he was travelling

                 out of India most of the times and though the Bank Account details were

                 submitted before the Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) for the first time,

                 the Assessee may be given one more opportunity to produce the said person

                 himself so that the credit entries can be verified by the by the learned

                 Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals), before whom the Bank Account details

                 were submitted.
</p>
<p id="p_7">                          4. The learned Senior Standing Counsel Mr.T.Ravikumar appearing for the

                 Revenue opposed the said submission and supported the impugned orders.

</p><p id="p_8">                          5. A bare perusal of the order of the Commissioner of Income Tax

                 (Appeals) in para 7.4, which is quoted below, would reveal that the Assessee

                 was put to questions about the said Cash Credit in the name of Mr.Bhuma

                 Ramakrishna Reddy, but, the Authorised Representative appearing for the

                 Assessee could not explain the same and answer the said questions and no

                 confirmation letter of the said person       was filed before the Commissioner of

                 Income Tax (Appeals).
</p>
<p id="p_9">                          6.   Para 7.4   of the order passed by the Commissioner of Income Tax

                 (Appeals) is quoted below for ready reference:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">                           "7.4. On verification of the ICICI Bank Statement it is noticed

                           that it is not NRI Account. The A.R. was asked to explain --

                           income? (iv) Is he assessed to tax in India (v) What is the

                           source for the deposits in the ICICI Bank Account? (vi) How

                           the money from abroad was deposited in the savings bank

                           account in India with ICICI Bank?
</p>
<p id="p_12">                                  The   Authorised    Representative   did   not   give   any

                           explanation to the above questions.
</p>
<p id="p_13">                                  Moreover the A.R. did not file any confirmation letter

                           from Mr.Bhuma Ramakrishna Reddy."
</p>
<p id="p_14">                          7. The Tribunal also confirmed the said findings with the following

                 observation:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">                            "12. We have considered the rival contentions and perused

                            the orders of the authorities below. Learned Commissioner

                            of Income Tax (Appeals) had given a clearly finding that

                            bank account Shri.Bhuma Ramakrishna Reddy with ICICI

                            was not an NRI account.      Assessee had failed to file any

                            confirmation   from      Shri.Bhuma   Ramakrishna        Reddy.

                            Assessee also could not give any details on the whereabouts

                            of Shri.Bhuma Ramakrishna Reddy. In such circumstances,

                            we are of the opinion that the addition was rightly made by

                            the learned Assessing Officer and confirmed by learned

                            Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals). We do not find any

                            reason to interfere with the orders of the lower authorities.

                            Grounds 4 &amp; 5 stand dismissed."
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">

</blockquote><p id="p_15">http://www.judis.nic.in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                                           5</span>

</p><p id="p_16">                          8. Though we do not find any substantial question of law arising in the

                 present matter, we are of the opinion that the Assessee can be accorded one

                 more opportunity to prove the said Cash Credit in the name of his close relative

                 Mr.Bhuma Ramakrishna Reddy, who could not be produced before the learned

                 Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) though the copies of the Bank Account

                 details were furnished by the Assessee.        The mere production of the Bank

                 Account copies was not sufficient and the entires made therein were required to

                 be proved by the Assessee by production of the said witness Mr.Bhuma

                 Ramakrishna Reddy.
</p>
<p id="p_17">                          9. In order to allow verification of entries in Bank Statement in this

                 regard, we are of the considered opinion that it would be appropriate and in the

                 interest of justice to remit the matter back to the learned Commissioner of

                 Income Tax (Appeals), who may examine the said witness at his own level and

                 return the findings in this regard. Since a considerable time has already passed

                 and the matter pertains to the Assessment Year 2014-2015, we direct the

                 Assessee to appear before the said Authority viz., Commissioner of Income Tax

                 (Appeals)      at the first instance on 25.3.2019 and direct the CIT (A) to pass

                 appropriate orders after the said person is produced before him and pass

                 appropriate orders within a period of 3 months thereafter.

</p><p id="p_18">                          10. With the above observation, the Appeal is disposed of. No orders as to
