                   W.P.(C) No. 5327 of 2008
                                      --
        Sushil Kumar Juneja                      ...Petitioner
                                 Versus
        .     The State of Jharkhand.
        2.    Deputy Commissioner, Bokaro Steel City, Bokaro.
        3.    Deputy Collector, Land &amp; Revenue, Bermo, Tenughat.
        4.    The Sub-Divisional Officer, Tenughat, Bokaro Steel Citym, Bokaro.
                         ......Respondents                                    -----
        Coram      :THE HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE R.K.MERATHIA

        For the Petitioner         : Mr. Piyush Poddar, Advocate
        For the Respondents        : Mr. Saurav Arun, Advocate
                                   -----

2/04.02.2011</pre><p id="p_1">          Counsel for the petitioner submitted that petitioner is a victim of 'Sikh'
        riot of 1984 and only because he could not receive the interim compensation of
        Rs.10,000/- as he was away to his native place, his claim has been rejected by the
        Deputy Commissioner while passing the order in terms of the order passed by
        this Hon'ble Court in WPC No. 718 of 2008 on 9.7.2008. It is further submitted on
        behalf of the petitioner that petitioner is getting treatment at AIIMS, New Delhi.
</p>
<p id="p_2">                      It appears from letter no. 1213 dated 18.12.2007 issued by the Circle
        Officer, Gomia that petitioner was a riot victim. From the letter no. 393/Ra/dated
        7.8.2008 issued by the Land Reforms Deputy Commissioner, Bermo Tenughat it
        appears that as the petitioner could not produce the documents in support of loss
        sustained by him, an interim compensation of Rs.10,000/- was recommended in
        his favour.
</p>
<p id="p_3">                      It is unfortunate that inspite of order dated 11.12.2009, no counter
        affidavit has been filed, though State counsel submitted that the said order was
        communicated to the concerned respondents, immediately.
</p>
<p id="p_4">                      In the circumstances, petitioner/his representative is permitted to
        make a fresh representation before the Deputy Commissioner, Bokaro. If a copy
        of the writ petition is filed, it can be treated as representation. If the Deputy
        Commissioner is satisfied that petitioner is entitled to compensation and to the
        amount claimed by him, he will pass orders for payment thereof. Such claim
        cannot be rejected on the ground that petitioner has not received interim
        compensation. However, if petitioner is not found entitled to compensation or the
        amount/part of it claimed by him, a reasoned order will be passed. This exercise
        must be completed within four weeks from the date of receipt of such
        representation.
</p>
<p id="p_5">                      It is made clear that this Court has not gone into the merits of the
        claim of the petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_6">                      With these observations and directions, this writ petition is disposed
        of.
</p>
<p id="p_7">                      As prayed, let a copy of the order be handed over to           the State
           counsel.
</p>
