Constitution of India.



HEADNOTE:
A  charge-sheet	 against the appellant and two	others,	 was
filed before the Special Judge Delhi u/s. 120-B <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_6">I.P.C</a>.	read
with<a href="/doc/258943/" id="a_7"> ss. 161</a> and <a href="/doc/258943/" id="a_8">165-A</a>, <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_9">I.P.C</a>. and<a href="/doc/1420677/" id="a_10"> s. 5(2)</a> of the Prevention
of  Corruption	Act, 1947.  Earlier,  at  the  Investigation
stage,	the  Chief Judicial Magistrate, Delhi,	had  granted
pardon	to,  an approver u/s. 337(1) Cr.   P.C.,  1898.	 :Me
appellant  applied for getting the Proceeding  quashed,	 but
his  application was dismissed, first by the Special  Judge,
and  thereafter	 by  the  High	Court  u/Art.  227  of	 the
Constitution and<a href="/doc/258943/" id="a_11"> s. 482</a>.  <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_12">Cr.P.C</a>.. 1898.
The  appellant	contended before  this Court, that,  on	 the
grant  of such a, pardon, the application of a. 8(1) of	 the
<a href="/doc/258943/" id="a_13">Criminal Law Amendment Act</a>, 1952 ceases for the reason	that
on  the	 charge sheet being tiled before a  Magistrate,	 the
accused can have the approver's evidence at the trial tested
against	 his  statement before the Magistrate, while  he  is
denied	this  opportunity where the charge  sheet  is  filed
before	the  Special Judge, thus rendering<a href="/doc/258943/" id="a_14"> s.  8(1)</a>  of	 the
Criminal  Law  Amendment  Act  if applied  to  such  a	case
discriminatory,	  and	violative   of	<a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_15">Art.   14</a>   of	 the
Constitution.
Dismissing the appeal the Court,
HELD : (1) <a href="/doc/258943/" id="a_16">Section 337</a> (2-B), under which the Magistrate  is
required  to send the case for trial to the  Special  Judge.
after examining the approver, does not in any way affect the
jurisdiction of the Special Judge.  By enacting	 sub-section
(2B)  in-1955, if the legislature sought to curb  the  power
given  to, the Special Judge by<a href="/doc/258943/" id="a_17"> s. 8(1)</a> of the Criminal	 Law
Amendment  Act, 1952, it would have expressed its  intention
clearly. [177 B-C]
(2)The fact that the approver's evidence cannot be  tested
against	 any previous statement does not make  any  material
difference  to the detriment of the  accused,  transgressing
<a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_18">Article	 14</a> of the Constitution.  The Special Judge, in	 any
case, will have to apply the well established tests for	 the
appreciation   of  the	accomplice's  evidence.	  The	mere
availability  of  two  procedures  would  not  justify	 the
quashing  of  a	 provision as being violative  of  <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_19">Art.	 14</a>,
unless	there  is  substantial	and  qualitative  difference
between	 the  two  procedures  so that	one  is	 really	 and
substantially  more drastic and prejudicial than the  other.

<p id="p_4">The Judgment of the Court was delivered by
GUPTA  J., This appeal by special leave is directed  against
an  order  of  the  Delhi High Court  refusing	to  quash  a
proceeding   pending against the appellant in the  Court  of
the Special Judge, Delhi.
</p><p id="p_5">On  or	about November 28, 1973 a charge sheet	against	 the
appellant  and	two  others was filed  before,	the  Special
Judge,	Tis  Hazari,  Delhi,  alleging	facts	constituting
offences   punishable under <a href="/doc/1897847/" id="a_21">section 120-B</a> Indian Penal	Code
read  with <a href="/doc/258943/" id="a_22">sections 161</a> and <a href="/doc/258943/" id="a_23">165A</a> of the,<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_24"> Indian	 Penal	Code</a>
and  <a href="/doc/1420677/" id="a_25">section  5(2)</a> of the  Prevention	  of	  Corruption
Act,	  1947.	       One Martin Joseph Fernandez had	been
arrested  in  correction with the case when it	was  at	 the
stage  of investigation.  He was produced before the,  Chief
Judicial  Magistrate,  Delhi, who tendered a pardon  to	 him
under <a href="/doc/366823/" id="a_26">section 337(1)</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898
(hereinafter referred to as<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_27"> the Code</a>). On December 12,	1975
the appellant applied to the Special Judgefor	 quashing
the proceeding for want of sanction under <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_28">section 197of</a>
the  Code and also on the ground of failure to	examine	 the
said  Martin  Joseph Fernandez as a witness as	required  by
sub-sections  (2) and (2B) of <a href="/doc/1402213/" id="a_29">section 337</a> of the Code.	 The
Special	  Judge	 having	 dismissed  the	  application,	 the
appellant  moved the Delhi High Court under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_30">Art. 227</a> of	 the
Constitution-  and  <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_31">section  482</a> of  the  Code	of  Criminal
Procedure,  1973 for setting aside the order passed  by	 the
Special	 Judge and quashing the proceeding.  On September  1
0,  1976 the High Court dismissed the  appellant's  petition
and  upheld  the order of the Special  Judge  rejecting	 the
prayer for quashing the proceeding.
</p><p id="p_6">Mr.  A. K. Sen appearing for the appellant has	not  pressed
the ground of want of sanction and has confined his argument
to  the other ground.  His contention is that once a  pardon
has  be-en  tendered  to  a  person  at	 the  stage  of	 the
investigation	under  <a href="/doc/366823/" id="a_32">section	337(1)</a>	of  the	 Code,	 the
provision  of  <a href="/doc/258943/" id="a_33">section 8(1)</a> of the, <a href="/doc/258943/" id="a_34">Criminal  Law  Amendment
Act</a>,  1952 empowering a Special Judge to take cognizance  of
offences  without  the accused being committed	to  him	 for
trial,	ceases to apply and the charge sheet in such a	case
must  be filed before a competent magistrate.  It is  argued
that  in  such	a  case	 letting  the  Special	Judge	take
cognizance of the offence under <a href="/doc/258943/" id="a_35">section 8(1)</a> of the Criminal
Law  Amendment Act would make the  provision  discriminatory
offending  <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_36">Article 14</a> of the Constitution.  The argument  is
built  on sub-section (2B) of <a href="/doc/366823/" id="a_37">section 337</a> of the Code  under
which the magistrate taking cognizance of the offence has to
examine	 the approver as a witness before sending  the	case
for trial to the Court of the Special Judge.
To  test this argument we may refer briefly to the  relevant
provisions<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_38"> of the Code</a>. <a href="/doc/1211562/" id="a_39">Section	 3</a>  <a href="/doc/1211562/" id="a_40">3</a> <a href="/doc/258943/" id="a_41">7</a> ( 1 )<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_42"> of  the  Code</a>
provides that in the case of any offence specified  therein,
the  District  Magistrate, a Presidency Magistrate,  a	Sub-
Divisional  Magistrate or any Magistrate of the first  class
may  at any stage of the investigation or enquiry  into,  or
the  trial of the offence may tender a pardon to any  person
supposed to have been concerned in the offence in any way on
condition  of his making a full an(] true disclosure of	 the
whole of the circumstances within his knowledge relative  to
the offence.  Sub-section. (2) of the section requires
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">176</span>
every  person  accepting  a tender.  of	 pardon	 under	this
section	 to  be examined as a witness in the  Court  of	 the
Magistrate  taking  cognizance	of the offence	and  in	 the
subsequent  trial,  if any.  Under subsection (2A)  where  a
person has accepted a tender of pardon and has been examined
under  sub-section  (2),  the  Magistrate  before  whom	 the
proceedings  are pending if he finds reasonable grounds	 for
believing  that	 the accused is guilty of an  offence  shall
commit him for trial to the Court of Sessions or, High Court
as the case may be.  Subsection (2B) on which the  appellant
relies reads:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">	      "In every case where the offence is punishable
	      under  <a href="/doc/258943/" id="a_43">section 161</a> or <a href="/doc/258943/" id="a_44">section 165</a>	 or  <a href="/doc/54942699/" id="a_45">section
	      165A</a>  of the Indian Penal Code or	 sub-section
	      (2)   of	<a href="/doc/616856/" id="a_46">section	 5</a>  of	the  Prevention	  of
	      Corruption  Act, 1947, and where a person	 has
	      accepted	a.  tender of pardon  and  has	been
	      examined	 under	 sub-section   (2),    then,
	      notwithstanding  anything	 contained  in	sub-
	      section  (2A),  a	 Magistrate  shall,  without
	      making any further inquiry, send the case	 for
	      trial  to	 the  Court  of	 the  Special  Judge
	      appointed	 under	the <a href="/doc/258943/" id="a_47">Criminal  Law  Amendment
	      Act</a>, 1952."
</blockquote><p id="p_7">Thus  under  subsection	 (2B)  in the  case  of	 an  offence
mentioned in them subsection the Magistrate has to send	 the
case  for  trial to the Court of the Special  Judge  without
making	 any  further  inquiry	as  to	whether	 there	 are
reasonable  grounds  for  believing  that  the	accused	  is
guilty,. but after the approved has been examined under sub-
section (2).
</p><p id="p_8">From  these provisions it would appear that where  a  person
has.  accepted a tender of pardon under sub-section  (1)  of
<a href="/doc/258943/" id="a_48">section	 337</a>  at  the  stage  of  investigation	 in  a	case
involving any of the offences specified in sub-section (2B),
the  prosecution  can file the charge sheet  either  in	 the
court of a competent Magistrate or before the Special  Judge
who,  under <a href="/doc/258943/" id="a_49">section 8(1)</a> of,the <a href="/doc/258943/" id="a_50">Criminal Law Amendment	Act</a>,
1952  has, power to take cognizance of the  offence  without
the  accused being committed to him for trial.	 It  follows
that if the Magistrate takes cognizance of the offence,	 the
approver will have to bet examined as a witness twice,	once
in the court of the Magistrate and again in the court of the
Special	 Judge to, whom the Magistrate has to send the	case
for trial, but if the charge sheet is filed directly in	 the
court  of  the Special Judge, he can be examined  once	only
before. the Special Judge.  This means that in a case  where
the charge sheet is filed in the court of a Magistrate,	 the
accused gets an opportunity of, having the evidence of	the,
approver at the trial tested against what he had said before
the Magistrate the accused is denied this opportunity  where
the charge sheet is filed in the court of the Special Judge.
Whether the accused will get the advantage of the  procedure
which according to the appellant is more, beneficial to	 the
accused thus depends on the court in which the proceeding is
initiated,  and, it is contended, if the choice of forum  is
left  to the prosecution, it will result in  discrimination.
Mr. Sen submits that the only way to avoid this position  is
to  read subsection (1), (2) and (2B) of <a href="/doc/1402213/" id="a_51">section 337</a> of	 the
Code  and  <a href="/doc/258943/" id="a_52">section 8(1)</a> of the Criminal Law  Amendment	Act,
1952 together and to construe them in a way to require	that
in  every  case where an accomplice is granted	pardon,	 the
charge sheet must be filed in the court of a Magistrate.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">177</span>
<p id="p_9">We  are unable to accept the contention.  It is	 clear	from
the  scheme of <a href="/doc/258943/" id="a_53">section 337</a> that what is required is  that  a
person who accepts a tender of pardon must be examined as  a
witness at the different stages of tile proceeding.   Where,
however,  a Special Judge takes cognizance of the case,	 the
occasion for examining the approver as a witness arises only
once.	It  is true that in such a case there would  be	 no,
previous evidence of the approver against which his evidence
at  the	 trial	could  be  tested,  which  would  have	been
available to the accused had the, proceeding been  initiated
in  the court of a Magistrate who under subsection  (2B)  of
<a href="/doc/1402213/" id="a_54">section	 337</a>  of the Code is required to send  the  case  to
trial  to the special Judge, after examining  the  approver.
But  we do not find anything in sub-section (2B) of  <a href="/doc/258943/" id="a_55">section
337</a>  to suggest that it affects in any way the	jurisdiction
of  the	 Special  Judge to take	 cognizance  of	 an  offence
without the accused being committed to him for trial.	Sub-
section	 (2B)  was  inserted  in  <a href="/doc/258943/" id="a_56">section  337</a>	in  1955  by
<a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_57">Amendment  Act</a> 26 of 1955.  If by enacting sub-section	(2B)
in 1955 the legislature sought to curb the power even to the
Special Judge by ,<a href="/doc/258943/" id="a_58">section 8(1)</a> of the Criminal Law Amendment
Act, 1952, there is no reason why the legislature should not
have  expressed its intention clearly.	Also, the-fact	that
the  approver's	 evidence  cannot  be  tested  against	 any
previous statement does not seem to us to make any  material
difference  to	the detriment of the  accused  transgressing
<a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_59">Article	 14</a> of the Constitution.  The special Judge, in	 any
case  will have to apply the well established tests for	 the
appreciation  of the accomplice's evidence.  This  Court  in
<a href="/doc/1293557/" id="a_60">Maganlal  Chhagganlal (P) Ltd.	V. Municipal Corporation  of
Greater Bombay and others</a>(1) held that mere availability  of
two procedures would not justify the quashing of a provision
as being violative of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_61">Article 14</a> and that "what is necessary
to attract the inhibition of the Article is that there	must
be  substantial and qualitative difference between  the	 two
procedure  so  that  one is really  and	 substantially	more
drastic	 and  prejudicial  than the, other. .  .  "  In	 our
opinion, there is no such qualitative difference in the	 two
procedures whither a witness is examined-once or twice	does
not in our opinion make any such substantial difference here
that one of them could be described as more drastic than the
other.	The appeal is accordingly dismissed.
