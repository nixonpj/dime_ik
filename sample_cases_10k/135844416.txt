          The Court : The principal prayer in this application was for audit of the

   accounts of Eastern Institute for Integrated Learning in Management [EIILM]

   since the financial year 2009-2010.
</p>
<p id="p_10">          Mr. P.K. Ghosh, learned senior advocate for the first defendant has taken

   me through the documents appended to the affidavit in opposition to the earlier

   interim application, filed on behalf of the second defendant. A series of e-mail

   correspondence has been brought to my notice. I form a concrete opinion from

   this correspondence that the balance-sheets from 2009-2010 were prepared by

   the parties in consultation with each other. This is so because I find that draft

   balance-sheets were forwarded by one party to the other for his views. Thereafter,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                                                                    2</span>




the balance-sheet was returned. At times it was sent back with counter views.

Thereafter, it was finalised, with consent, prima facie.

</p><p id="p_11">       In those circumstances, I see no justification for reopening the audit of

EIILM Foundation at this point of time.
</p>
<p id="p_12">       After hearing the submissions on behalf of the parties, it appears that there

is a complete deadlock amongst members of the three-member committee.

According to the terms of appointment of the committee it is to function by

unanimous decisions only. When this state of affairs was brought to the notice of

Patherya, J. her ladyship by an order dated 3rd October, 2013 appointed Mr.

Sondwip Mukherjee, advocate as the Special Officer to settle the disputes amongst

members of the Committee and evolve a workable solution.

</p><p id="p_13">       I am of the opinion that the said order be fully implemented. The

Committee should try to be unanimous when it comes to taking important

decisions for the functioning of the institute.

</p><p id="p_14">       There is one substantial controversy, which has been raised, in my opinion,

in this application. Although Mr. Ghosh, learned senior advocate tried to provide

an explanation, but to my mind this explanation would more fully come out when

affidavits are exchanged. This point relates to the ECC payment. According to the

rules of the Foundation a person is paid Rs.40,000/- as ECC fee, if he introduces

one student. This person is paid Rs.45,000/- per student if he introduces ten or

more ten students. This amount is only payable upon the students paying the full

annual fee or full course, whichever happens earlier. According to the statements

appended to the petition, it appears that full ECC payment was made before

payment of the annual fee by the student. In some cases amounts much in excess

of the stipulated amount have been paid. Mr. Ghosh produces some documents

and argues that the amounts paid were much lesser. For example, he says that

only Rs.90,000/- was paid to Mr. Pradip Mukhopadhyay, Rs.45,000/- paid to

Smt. Rupashree Banerjee and Rs.27,000/- paid to Mr. Kanak Kumar Maity.

</p><p id="p_15">       Till this point is fully resolved on filing of affidavits, I ask Mr. Sandwip

Mukherjee, Special Officer to ensure that no ECC payment is made in derogation

of the above stipulation made in the rules of the Foundation.

</p><p id="p_16">       Let affidavits be exchanged according to the following directions:
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                                                                             3</span>




</p><p id="p_17">                Let affidavit in opposition be filed by 9th June, 2014. List this application

         along with all pending applications on 25th June, 2014. Affidavit in reply, if any,

         may be filed in the mean time. Let affidavits be similarly exchanged in GA

         No.3063 of 2013.
</p>
<p id="p_18">                So far as prayer [c] is concerned, a reasonable notice of all payments above

         Rs.25,000/- for travelling expenses and advertisement have to be made to the

         plaintiff's representative so that he can properly object before Mr. Mukherjee, the

         Special Officer.
</p>
<p id="p_19">                Let the Special Officer be paid by the Institute 1200 GMs. as his ad hoc

         remuneration by 4th June, 2014 for the work already done. He may be further

         paid @ Rs.12,000/- per month commencing from 1st June, 2014 as his

         remuneration from the funds of the Institute.
</p>
<p id="p_20">                Certified photocopy of this order, if applied for, be supplied to the parties

         subject to compliance with all requisite formalities.
