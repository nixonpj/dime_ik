<p id="p_16">16.   PW4 Raghvansh Tyagi has, in his cross examination, made

            cannot tell when the alteration was made in the tenanted

<p id="p_17">17.   In the light of evidence of the parties, it is admitted by the 
applicant   no.1   (PW2   Dr.   Sunder   Saran   Bhatnagar)   that   the 
respondent   no.1   has   been   paying   rent   to   him   upto   date.  The 
applicant no.1 has also admitted that he himself was receiving 
rent. It is admitted by the applicant no.2 that the respondents no.

<p id="p_18"> 2 and 3 are sons of the respondent no.1. In view of the above, it is 
proved   that   since   the   inception   of   the   tenancy   till   date,   the 
respondent no.1 was paying rent to the applicants in respect of 
the premises.
</p><p id="p_19">18.    PW3   has   also   admitted   in   his  cross   examination   that   the 
respondent no.1 is a tenant and the respondent nos. 2 and 3 are 
looking after the business of the tenanted premises. PW3 has also 
admitted that the respondents no.2 and 3 are looking after the 
business from the very beginning from the inception of the shop. 
PW3  has  also   admitted  that  the shop  in  question   is being   run 
from the premises under the name and style of Budhiraja Medical 
Store from the last 10­15 years. In view of the admissions made by 
PW3 in his cross examination, it is proved that the respondents 
no.2   and   3   were   looking   after   the   business   of   the   premises   in 
which the respondent no.1 is a tenant, since the very beginning.  
</p><p id="p_20">19.    PW4 has also admitted that the respondent no.2 and 3 used 
to sit in both the shops and look after the same but, he has no 
where   stated   that   the   respondents   no.2   and   3   are   in   exclusive 
possession of the premises. 
</p><p id="p_21">20.    In view of the above cross­examination of PW2, PW3 and 
PW4, it is highly probable that the respondents no.2 and 3 are 
only looking after the business of medical store and cassettes of 

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">E-563/06     Dr. Sunder Saran Bhatnagar &amp; Anr. v. Nihal Chand &amp; Ors.   Page 12 of 15</span>
 their father, the respondent no.1. 
</p><p id="p_22">21.   The applicants have not placed on record any material to 
prove   that   that   the   respondents   no.2   and   3   are   in   exclusive 
possession of the premises. The applicants have also not placed 
on   record   any   material   to   prove   that   the   respondent   no.1   has 
sublet the premises without obtaining the consent in writing of 
the   applicants   and   that   between   the   respondent   no.1   and   the 
respondents   no.2   and   3,   there   is   a   relationship   of   lessor   and 
lessee. 
</p><p id="p_23">22.   Next comes the question of making substantial damages to 
the premises. PW2 Dr. Sunder Saran Bhatnagar  (the applicant no.
</p><p id="p_24">2) has, in his cross­examination admitted that since the inception 
of   the   tenancy   i.e.   1961,   the   respondent   no.1   had   carried   out 
some necessary repairs at his own costs whenever required and 
he had never objected to the same so far. PW3 Dr. V.S. Rawat has 
also  admitted  in  his  cross  examination  that  the  premises  were 
constructed about 40 years ago and the respondent had carried 
out necessary  repairs  from  his  own  pocket whenever  required. 
The  applicant  no.1 has also  admitted   in  his  cross­examination 
that fire had broken out in both the portion of tenanted premises. 
Neither PW2 Dr. Sunder Saran Bhatnagar (the applicant no.1) nor 
PW3 nor PW4 have been able to state in their cross­examination 

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">E-563/06     Dr. Sunder Saran Bhatnagar &amp; Anr. v. Nihal Chand &amp; Ors.   Page 13 of 15</span>
 when alteration was carried out by the respondent no.1. PW4 was 
unable to deny the question whether the partition of the shop 
was made by wooden almirah or otherwise. In view of the above, 
it is proved that the respondent no.1 had carried out necessary 
repairs   in   the   premises   whenever   required,   more   particularly 
after fire had broken out in the premises and the applicants never 
objected to it which suggest that they had consented the carrying 
out of repairs by the respondent no.1. 
</p><p id="p_25">23.   PW2 Dr. Sunder Saran Bhatnagar (the applicant no.1) has 
himself   admitted   in   his   cross­examination   that   except   the 
photographs   he   had   not   filed   any   documentary   proof   to   show 
that there was a partition wall. PW2 has also admitted that the 
partition wall was not visible in the photographs Ex.PW2/2 and 
Ex.PW2/3.  The   photographs   Ex.PW2/2   and   Ex.PW2/3   were   not 
proved by the applicants as per the law. Even otherwise, these 
photographs are of no use when, admittedly, they do not show 
the alleged partition wall. 
</p><p id="p_26">24.   The   site­plan   Ex.PW2/1   was   also   not   proved   by   the 
applicants as per law. PW2 has admitted that he has got prepared 
the   site­plan   from   the   draftsman.  The   said   draftsman   was   not 
examined by the applicants. In view of the above, the site­plan 
also remained unproved.

<p id="p_27"> 25.   For   the   discussions   afore­stated,   there   is   no   material   on 
record to prove that the respondent no.1 has sublet the premises 
without obtaining the consent in writing of the applicants and 
that between the respondent no.1 and the respondents no.2 and 
3, there is a relationship of lessor and lessee.  The applicants have 
also   failed   to   prove   that   the   respondent   no.1   has   caused 
substantial damages to the premises without the consent of the 
applicants and has raised the floor level and height of the shop of 
the premises.
