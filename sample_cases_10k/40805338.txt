<p id="p_1">     This petition is filed under Articles 226 and 227 of

the Constitution of India read with <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_1">Section 482</a> of

Cr.P.C., seeking to quash the criminal proceedings in

C.C.No.1202/2010 (arising out of Crime No.117/2010)

registered for the offences punishable under <a href="/doc/1099980/" id="a_2">Sections

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                  3</span><p id="p_2">


</p><p id="p_3">      2.    Petitioner was a Writer in Maddur Police

Station during the year 2008.           On 03.04.2008 a memo

was    received    in    the   Police     Station   from    Maddur

Government Hospital stating that two persons by name

Anil Babu and Santhosh were admitted in hospital,

having sustained injuries in a vehicle accident.                It is

alleged that the petitioner being the Station House Officer

at the relevant time, failed to act on the said memo.

Neither did the petitioner register the case nor did he

visit the hospital to ascertain the facts. Subsequently, on

12.04.2008, a written complaint was received by the

petitioner in the Police Station. On the basis of the said

written complaint, petitioner registered a case in Crime

No.171/2008 under <a href="/doc/1270101/" id="a_8">Section 279</a>, <a href="/doc/1402213/" id="a_9">337</a> and <a href="/doc/1721129/" id="a_10">338</a> of IPC and

conducted part of the investigation into the said crime.


</p><p id="p_4">      3.    That being the case, a complaint was lodged

by    respondent        No.2   alleging     that    the    petitioner

intentionally failed to take any action pursuant to the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                 4</span>


MLC intimation, instead, in collusion with the injured

Anil Babu and Santhosh, he registered a false case in

Cr.No.171/2008     to     facilitate   the   injured     to        claim

compensation from the Insurance Company.                 Based on

the   said   complaint,     a   further      statement        of     the

complainant/respondent No.2 was recorded and a charge

sheet was submitted before the JMFC, Maddur, alleging

commission of offences under <a href="/doc/1436241/" id="a_11">Sections 420</a>, <a href="/doc/1317063/" id="a_12">465</a>, <a href="/doc/556166/" id="a_13">468</a>,

<a href="/doc/1466184/" id="a_14">471</a> read with <a href="/doc/1185693/" id="a_15">Section 511</a>, <a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_16">34</a> of IPC by the petitioner.


</p><p id="p_5">      4.     The main contention urged by the petitioner

is that, he has acted in discharge of his official duties;

being the Writer, on 03.04.2008, he was not required

either to register the compliant or to conduct any

investigation. On 12.04.2008, he was the Station House

Officer and therefore, on receiving the complaint, he has

registered the FIR and has conducted the part of the

investigation and therefore, the allegations made against

him in the charge sheet are totally baseless. Further, it
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                             5</span>


is contended that being a Public Servant, a prior sanction

was required to be obtained under Section 170 of the

Karnataka Police Act and also under <a href="/doc/12704/" id="a_17">Section 197</a> of

Cr.P.C. In the instance case, the prosecution has been

initiated   without   complying     with   these   mandatory

provisions, thereby the entire action taken by the

respondent No.1 being in violation of the statutory

requirement is required to be quashed in exercise of

<a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_18">Section 482</a> of Cr.P.C. as well as under Articles 226 and

227 of the Constitution of India.
</p>
<p id="p_6">
</p><p id="p_7">      5.    Learned Addl. SPP has opposed the petition,

interalia contending    that the allegations made in the

charge sheet prima-facie make out the offences against

the petitioner and moreover, the said acts having been

committed by the petitioner beyond his official duties,

prior permission of his appointing authorities is not

necessary for the prosecution of the petitioner.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                               6</span>


</p><p id="p_8">      6.    Learned counsel appearing for respondent

No.2 has referred to the decision rendered by this Court

in the case of <a href="/doc/174322891/" id="a_19">Sri H.S.Cheluvaraju vs. The State of

Karnataka</a>, rep., by its Police Sub-Inspector, West

Police Station, Mandya and Another in ILR 2015 KAR

3983 and would submit that the petitioner having not

committed the alleged acts in discharge of his official

duties, it is not required to obtain prior sanction, in the

facts and circumstances of the case. Therefore, there is

no   infirmity   whatsoever    in   the   initiation    of   the

proceedings against the petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_9">

</p><p id="p_10">      7.    Having heard the learned counsel for the

parties and having gone through the contentions urged

in the petition, the point that arise for consideration are:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">      I.    Whether the allegations made against
            the petitioner prima-facie make out the
            offences alleged against him?</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">      II.   Whether in the face of the above
            allegations     prior     sanction         as
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                       7</span>


                contemplated under Section 170 of the
                Karnataka Police Act and <a href="/doc/12704/" id="a_20">Section 197</a>
                of   Cr.P.C.    was       necessary     for    the
                prosecution of the petitioner ?
</blockquote>


<blockquote id="blockquote_3">        8.      POINT NO.I:</blockquote><p id="p_11">

</p><p id="p_12">        With regard to the allegations made in the charge

sheet, there can be no manner of doubt that the said

allegations squarely attract the offence alleged against

the petitioner under Section 420, 465, 468, 471 R/W

<a href="/doc/1185693/" id="a_21">Section 511</a> and            <a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_22">34</a> of IPC.              There are specific

accusations that the petitioner in discharge of his duty

as Writer failed to take action pursuant to the MLC

intimation and further the petitioner created false

documents in order to facilitate the other accused to

claim    compensation          from       the     Insurance    Company.

These        allegations   squarely        fall     within    the    above

provisions.          Hence, point No.1 is held against the

petitioner.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                 8</span><p id="p_13">


</p><p id="p_14">        9.     POINT NO.II:
</p>
<p id="p_15">        The     material   allegations   leveled     against   the

petitioner are that while serving as the Police Constable

as Writer, petitioner failed to take action on the MLC

intimation received on 3.4.2008.           Further, it is alleged

that after registering the FIR based on the complaint

dated        12.04.2008,   he    created     false    documents.

According to the prosecution, both these acts were

committed by the petitioner while on prosecution duty as

Station House officer. These accusations imply that the

petitioner either failed to act on the MLC intimation when

he was required to act thereon, and secondly, he acted in

excess of his powers while conducting the investigation

by creating false documents.               The alleged act of

dereliction of duty or acts in excess of the powers

conferred on him have direct nexus between the nature

of   duties     cast   upon   the   petitioner     and   the   acts

constituting the offences alleged against him.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                             9</span>


</p><p id="p_16">     10.   In that view of the matter, the prosecuting

agency was required to obtain the prior sanction of the

competent authority as contemplated under Section 170

of the Karnataka Police Act and <a href="/doc/12704/" id="a_23">Section 197</a> of Cr.P.C.

Even in the decision relied on by the learned counsel for

respondent No.2, the settled proposition of law has been

enunciated to the effect that the protection under <a href="/doc/12704/" id="a_24">Section

197</a> Cr.P.C. would be available only when there is a

direct or reasonable nexus between the nature of the

duties cast upon the public servant and the act

constituting an offence and not otherwise.


</p><p id="p_17">     11.    For the above reasons, the initiation of the

proceedings against the petitioner without prior sanction

under Section 170 of the Karnataka Police Act and

<a href="/doc/12704/" id="a_25">Section 197</a> of Cr.P.C is illegal and therefore, cannot be

sustained. As a result, the prosecution initiated against

the petitioner in C.C.No.1202/2010 (arising out of Crime

No.117/2010) registered for the offences punishable
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                             10</span>


under <a href="/doc/1436241/" id="a_26">Sections 420</a>, <a href="/doc/1317063/" id="a_27">465</a>, <a href="/doc/556166/" id="a_28">468</a>, <a href="/doc/1466184/" id="a_29">471</a> read with <a href="/doc/1185693/" id="a_30">Sections

511</a>, <a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_31">34</a> of IPC pending on the file of Civil Judge (Jr.Dvn.)

&amp; JMFC-II, Maddur, are quashed reserving liberty to

respondent No.1 to take any appropriate action in the

matter if advised, as per law.
