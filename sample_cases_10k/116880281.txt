                         JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">      This suit is filed by the plaintiffs against the

defendants for recovery of Rs.44,39,664/-.

</p><p id="p_2">      2.     The case of the plaintiffs as per the plaint

averments is that the defendants are the partners in

the partnership firm M/s Krishna Creations. The

plaintiffs and their family members lend money to the

firms directly in the firm name and also through its

partners. During the tenure of partnership of 2nd

plaintiff   in    the     partnership          firm     M/s   Krishna

Creations,       as   requested     by     the        defendants,    the
                                   {3}              O.S.No.7522/2011

plaintiffs had furnished their family property as

collateral security and surety towards the loan availed

by the partners in the name of partnership firm from

M/s Karnataka State Financial Corporation and the

defendants assured to refund the loan amount with

interest at the rate of 18% p.a. and also pay amount as

consideration to the property furnished as collateral

security and surety.
</p>
<p id="p_3">      The plaintiffs further submits that on the date

when the 2nd plaintiff opted to retire from the

partnership firm, the defendants were called upon to

settle   the     dues       and   also   release    the     property

documents        from    M/s      Karnataka       State    Financial

Corporation. After discussion, the defendants agreed to

settle amount of Rs.25,00,000/-,which was accepted

by the plaintiffs.
</p>
<p id="p_4">      The      plaintiffs    further     submit     that    towards

payment, the defendants issued cheques bearing

No.388440 dt.4.7.2007 for Rs.20,00,000/- in the name

of   first   plaintiff   and      cheque   bearing        No.388439

dt.4.7.2007 for Rs.5,00,000/- in the name of 2nd
                                 {4}              O.S.No.7522/2011

plaintiff, in total for a sum of Rs.25,00,000/- drawn

on Canara Bank, Seshadripuram branch, Bangalore.

The said amount includes the balance loan amount

with interest.
</p>
<p id="p_5">     At para 6, the plaintiffs submit that during the

transit from the plaintiffs' residence to the bank, the

above-mentioned cheques were lost and the same was

communicated        to    the    defendants      verbally.     The

defendants assured to issue fresh cheques towards

settlement in lieu of the lost cheques. But in spite of

repeated     requests     made        by   the   plaintiffs,   the

defendants       have    not    issued     the   cheques.      The

defendants started to give amount in bits and piece

between the period July 2007 and October 2008,

amounting to Rs.2,40,000/- and the balance amount

due by the defendants is Rs.29,11,255/-. Towards

repayment of the said amount, the defendant No.3

issued the cheque bearing No.332406 dt.4.11.2008 for

Rs.22,76,762/- in favour of first plaintiff and cheque

No.332405 dt.4.11.2008 for a sum of Rs.6,34,493/- in

favour of 2nd plaintiff, in total Rs.29,11,255/- drawn on
                                {5}              O.S.No.7522/2011

Canara Bank, Seshadripuram branch, Bangalore. But

on presentation of the said cheques by the plaintiffs

with      their     bankers        i.e.,   Syndicate     Bank,

Seshadripuram branch, Bangalore, the same were

dishonoured and returned with endorsement 'funds

insufficient' on 16.3.2009. Hence the plaintiffs got

issued two separate legal notices dt.19.3.2009 by

RPAD and under certificate of posting demanding

payment from the defendants and the said notices

were served on the defendants. The defendants replied

through     reply   notice     dt.1.4.2009      and   10.4.2009

denying their liability and attached the statement of

payment      made     to     the   plaintiffs   amounting     to

Rs.29,60,143.50, inclusive of loan amount and surety

amount.
</p>
<p id="p_6">       The plaintiffs submit that they do not dispute the

receipt of the payment from the defendants as detailed

by them. But further submitted that after accounting

for all the payments made by the defendants, the

defendants further owed a sum of Rs.29,11,255/-
</p><p id="p_7">                             {6}         O.S.No.7522/2011

towards which the defendants have issued above said

two cheques.
</p>
<p id="p_8">     The plaintiffs submit that they filed a criminal

case against the defendants u/s 138 of N.I.Act and the

same is pending in the additional CMM Court. The

defendants issued the above said cheques without

bothering to maintain sufficient balance in their

account with an intention to harass the plaintiffs and

deprive the defendants of their right over the amount

which the defendants are due to the plaintiffs.

Therefore, as on the date of filing of this suit, the

defendants are due to the plaintiffs a sum of

Rs.29,11,255/- along with interest at 18% p.a. from

4.1.2008 to October 2011.
</p>
<p id="p_9">     The plaintiffs further submit that the cause of

action for filing of the suit arose on 4.7.2007 when the

defendants issued cheques for final settlement, on

4.11.2008 when the defendants issued cheques in lieu

of lost cheques, on 13.3.2009 when the cheques were

returned dishonoured and on 16.3.2009 when the

plaintiffs were notified by their bankers at Bangalore
                              {7}           O.S.No.7522/2011

and on 19.3.2009 when the demand notice was sent to

the defendants which was served on the defendants on

20.3.2009 and when the defendants failed to make

payment. The parties to the suit are residing and the

transaction   was     held   in    Bangalore    within    the

jurisdiction of this Court and hence this Court has

territorial jurisdiction to try this case. Therefore, the

plaintiffs requested the court to decree the suit as

prayed in the prayer column of the plaint.

</p><p id="p_10">     3.    On the other hand, the defendant No.2 filed

written   statement    and   the    same   is   adopted    by

defendants 1 and 3. In the written statement, the

defendant No.2 took contention that the suit is not

maintainable either in law or on facts and the same is

liable to be dismissed in lumine. Further contended

that the plaintiffs have alleged that the cause of action

arose on 4.7.2007 when the alleged cheques bearing

Nos.388440 and 388439 were issued by the defendants

and, it is the case of the plaintiffs that the said cheques

were lost and the cheques dt.4.11.2008 are alleged to

have been issued by M/s Balaji Creations who are not
                           {8}               O.S.No.7522/2011

parties to the suit. But it is submitted by the 2nd

defendant that the cause of action for the suit, as per

the plaint averments, arose on 4.7.2007 and not on

4.11.2008 or 13.3.2009 or 16.3.2009 or 19.3.200 or on

20.3.2009 and that the suit has been filed on

20.10.2011 and therefore, the suit is barred by

limitation. The suit based on the alleged joinder of

cause of action is not maintainable as the cause of

action of each plaintiff is different from other and the

transactions are independent of the other as per the

plaint averments. Therefore the suit is not maintainable

due to mis-joinder and non-joinder of parties.

</p><p id="p_11">     It is further submitted by the 2nd defendant that

the alleged cheques referred to by the plaintiffs belong

to   M/s   Balaji   Creations   and   its    Propretrix    is

Mrs.Smitha V.Karia. Therefore without impleading the

said person, the suit filed by the plaintiff is bad for

non-joinder of necessary party.
</p>
<p id="p_12">     The defendants denied the allegations made at

para 3 of the plaint, but submits that the plaintiffs

claim to be money lenders, but they have not
                          {9}             O.S.No.7522/2011

possessed money-lenders' licence, hence the plaintiffs

are not entitled to any relief. The 2nd defendant

submits that the defendants who are partners of the

firm by name M/s Krishna Creations were on the look

out to obtain financial assistance from banks and it

was during that time, the husband of 1st plaintiff by

name   Mr.Kamalskha    Kini    offered   the   immovable

property bearing No.83/2,2nd Main, Anjaneya Block,

Seshadripuram, Bangalore as security to the KSFC

and against the security of the said property, the

defendants have raised loan and at that point of time,

Mr.Kamalaksha Kini imposed a condition that the 2nd

plaintiff should be inducted as a partner of the

defendant firm and accordingly the 2nd plaintiff was

inducted as a partner of the defendant firm vide

Reconstitution of the Partnership deed dt.1.4.1996.

The 2nd plaintiff is only a sleeping partner and

contribution was in the form of collateral security of

the building.
</p>
<p id="p_13">     The 2nd defendant further submits that during

the period of 2nd plaintiff's partnership with the
                             {10}             O.S.No.7522/2011

defendant    firm,    the    defendants       were    paying

commission to the facility provided and the said

commission agreed to was oral and there was no

written document or agreement between the parties

and that the security offered continued during the life

time of Mr.Kamalaksha Kini and that the defendants

were drawing the cheque and making the cash

payment as per the instruction of Mr.Kamalaksha Kini

during his life time and payments were made in the

name of various members of the plaintiffs' family.

</p><p id="p_14">      The 2nd defendant submits that there has been no

financial borrowings from the plaintiffs or any member

of their family and hence there was no agreement to

the contrary with regard to the payment of interest of

18% p.a. and the defendants were paying only

commission of the collateral security offered. Further

2nd   defendant      submits       that   after   death    of

Mr.Kamalaksha Kini, the 2nd plaintiff was insisting on

obtaining the release of the collateral security from the

Karnataka State Finance Corporation and accordingly

the defendants made arrangements for the release of
                             {11}              O.S.No.7522/2011

the collateral security as per the letter dt.3.7.2007

issued by the Karnataka State Finance Corporation.

Further   submits    that   after   release     of   collateral

security, the 2nd plaintiff retired from the partnership

firm vide Reconstitution Deed dt.12.7.2007. In the said

Reconstitution Deed, it is clearly mentioned that the

2nd plaintiff has received all the dues from the Firm

and has no claim whatsoever and therefore there was

no further privity of contract between the 2nd plaintiff

and defendant firm for payment of any commission,

since the collateral security was duly released and the

original documents of title from the Karnataka State

Finance Corporation were delivered to the 2nd plaintiff.

</p><p id="p_15">     It is denied by the 2nd defendant that on the

retirement of the 2nd plaintiff, the defendants had

agreed to settle the alleged claim of the 2nd plaintiff in a

sum of Rs.25,00,000/- as absolutely false. Further

submits that on the retirement of the 2nd plaintiff from

the 2nd defendant firm, the accounts were duly settled

and there was no promise or any contract to pay any

amount as claimed by the 2nd plaintiff.
</p><p id="p_16">                            {12}             O.S.No.7522/2011

     Further the 2nd defendant submits that the

submission of the plaintiffs made in para 5 of the

plaint that the alleged amount of Rs.25 lakhs included

the loan amount with interest is totally false and there

is no clarity. The 2nd defendant categorically states that

no amount is due or payable to the plaintiffs.

</p><p id="p_17">     In para 13 of the written statement, the 2nd

defendant submits that the loss of cheques bearing

Nos.388440    and   388439        is   propounded   by   the

plaintiffs, since the 2nd plaintiff who had access to the

office of the defendant firm during his tenure as

sleeping partner, has misused the trust and has

concocted the theory of loss of cheques dt.4.7.2007.

</p><p id="p_18">     The 2nd defendant further submits that there was

no privity of contract like surety consideration payable

as there has been no financial loan transaction

between the plaintiffs and the defendant firm. Further

contention of the plaintiffs that the cheques bearing

Nos.388440 and 388439 dt.4.7.2007 were lost in

transit and the same was intimated to the defendants

verbally is false and untrue.
</p><p id="p_19">                           {13}             O.S.No.7522/2011

     Further the 2nd defendant submits that the 2nd

plaintiff who had access to the office of the defendant

firm has clandestinely removed some cheques of Balaji

Creations   of   which   Mrs.Smitha    V.Karia     is   the

Proprietrix, has forged the signature, filled up the

amount and had presented the cheques bearing

No.332405 dt.4.11.2008 for Rs.6,34,493/- and cheque

bearing No.332406 dt.4.11.2008 for Rs.22,76,762/-

drawn on Canara Bank, Seshadripuram branch,

Bangalore. Therefore, the 2nd defendant submits that

annexure 'G' &amp; 'H' were never issued by propritriex as

there was no privity of any contract between the

plaintiffs and M/s Balaji Creations and the amount

mentioned in the said cheques is neither due nor

payable either by Balaji Creations or by the defendant

firm and that the suit of the plaintiffs based on the

said cheque is not maintainable as the said negotiable

instrument is not supported by any consideration and

is not a legally enforceable instrument.

</p><p id="p_20">     Further the defendants denied the pleadings of

the plaint at para 7 stating that the suit is not
                            {14}            O.S.No.7522/2011

maintainable since the plaintiffs have not specifically

stated as to the nature of the suit whether the suit is

based on accounts or on negotiable instrument and

therefore, the suit as bought about by the plaintiffs is

not maintainable and is liable to be dismissed with

costs.
</p>
<p id="p_21">     The defendants denied the allegations made at

para 8 of the plaint as false and untrue. Further the

defendants denying the allegations made in para 9 of

the plaint that the suit cheques were dishonored for

want of sufficient funds, submits that since the

plaintiffs neither lawful owners of the suit cheques nor

in   lawful   possession   nor    there   is   any   legally

enforceable debt or binding privity of contract between

the plaintiffs and Balaji Creations.

</p><p id="p_22">     Further the defendants submit that it is evident

from the bank statement that the suit cheques

pertaining to the year 2007 and the plaintiffs claims

that the suit cheques were issued during November,

2008, when the intervening cheques of M/s Balaji

Creations were cleared during June 2007. The 2nd
                               {15}              O.S.No.7522/2011

defendant submits that the suit cheques are fabricated

documents and manipulated by the plaintiffs with the

malafide intention to make a wrongful gain at the cost

of the defendants.
</p>
<p id="p_23">     The defendants further submit that there is no

cause of action arose for filing of this suit as alleged in

para 16 of the plaint and the same is false and the suit

suffers for want of cause of action, and hence the

plaint is liable to be rejected under Order VII Rule 11

of C.P.C. Therefore, on these grounds, the defendants

prayed to dismiss the suit filed by the plaintiffs in the

interest of justice and equity.
</p>
<p id="p_24">     4.    On perusing the pleadings of the plaint and

also written statement filed by the defendants, my

predecessor has framed Issue Nos.1 to 7 on 31.1.2013

and one additional issue is framed by this court on

8.1.2018, as follows:-
</p>

                       REASONS

</pre><p id="p_35">     8. ISSUE NOs.1 to 6: These six Issues are taken

together for common discussion in order to avoid

repetition of facts and evidence since the burden of

proving these Issues lies on the plaintiffs.

</p><p id="p_36">     9.    It is the case of the plaintiffs that during the

tenure of partnership of 2nd plaintiff in the partnership

firm M/s Krishna Creations, as requested by the

defendants, they had furnished their family property

as collateral security and surety towards the loan

availed by the partners in the name of partnership firm

from M/s Karnataka State Financial Corporation.

Further it is the case of the plaintiffs that the

defendants assured to refund the loan amount with

interest at the rate of 18% p.a. On the date when the

2nd plaintiff opted to retire from the partnership firm,

the plaintiffs called upon the defendants to settle the

dues and also get release the property documents from

M/s Karnataka State Financial Corporation. The

defendants agreed to settle amount of Rs.25,00,000/-

and they also released the documents from Karnataka
                             {19}          O.S.No.7522/2011

State    Finance Corporation. The      plaintiffs further

submit that towards payment, the defendants issued

cheques     bearing    No.388440       dt.4.7.2007     for

Rs.20,00,000/- in the name of first plaintiff and

cheque      bearing    No.388439      dt.4.7.2007      for

Rs.5,00,000/- in the name of 2nd plaintiff, in total for a

sum of Rs.25,00,000/-         drawn on Canara Bank,

Seshadripuram     branch,    Bangalore.     As   per   the

contention of the plaintiffs, the said cheques were lost

in transit while going from the plaintiffs' residence to

their bank and the same was communicated orally to

the defendants. The defendants assured to issue fresh

cheques towards settlement in lieu of the lost cheques.

But in spite of repeated requests made by the

plaintiffs, the defendants have not issued the cheques,

but started to give amount in bits and piece between

the period July 2007 and October 2008, amounting to

Rs.2,40,000/- and undertook to pay the balance

amount with interest. Towards repayment of the said

amount, the defendant No.3 issued the cheque bearing

No.332406 dt.4.11.2008 for Rs.22,76,762/- in favour
                            {20}           O.S.No.7522/2011

of 1st plaintiff and cheque No.332405 dt.4.11.2008 for

a sum of Rs.6,34,493/- in favour of 2nd plaintiff, in

total for Rs.29,11,255/- drawn on Canara Bank,

Seshadripuram       branch,       Bangalore.   But     on

presentation of the said cheques by the plaintiffs with

their bankers i.e., Syndicate Bank, Seshadripuram

branch, Bangalore, the same were dishonoured and

returned with endorsement 'funds insufficient' on

16.3.2009 and endorsement was also issued by the

said bank separately. Therefore the plaintiffs got

issued two separate legal notices dt.19.3.2009 through

RPAD and Under certificate of posting demanding

payment from the defendants and the said notices

were served on the defendants. The defendants replied

through   reply   notice   dt.1.4.2009   and   10.4.2009

denying their liability. But in spite of repeated requests

and demand made by the plaintiffs, the defendants

failed to make payment of amount due from them to

the plaintiffs.   Further the plaintiffs submit that a

criminal case against the defendants U/S 138 of

N.I.Act has been filed.
</p><p id="p_37">                            {21}           O.S.No.7522/2011

</p><p id="p_38">     10.    In order to prove whether defendants have

issued cheque bearing No.332406 dt.4.11.2008 for a

sum of Rs.22,76,762/- and cheque bearing No.332405

dt.4.11.2008 for a sum of Rs.6,34,493/-, the plaintiff

No.2 who is son also General Power of Attorney holder

of 1st plaintiff as per Ex.P29, adduced his oral evidence

by way of filing his sworn affidavit as PW1 and in

further chief examination of PW1, the documents

produced by him are marked as Ex.P1 to P30. Here the

facts narrated in the chief examination of PW1 are

nothing but repetition of the pleadings of the plaint.

Therefore    again   it   need    not   requires   further

explanation. In the cross-examination of PW1, Ex.D1

to D7 are marked.
</p>
<p id="p_39">     11.    In this case the 2nd defendant filed written

statement and the same is adopted by defendants 1

and 3. In the written statement, they have totally

denied that there is privity of contract between

plaintiffs with them. They admitted that they are the

partners of the firm M/s Krishna Creations. Further

the contention of the defendants is that cheque
                               {22}             O.S.No.7522/2011

dt.4.11.2008       is alleged to have been issued by M/s

Balaji Creations, who is not party to the suit. Therefore

the firm contention of the defendants is that there is no

any legally recoverable debt existed in respect of the

transaction       taken   place      between   plaintiffs   and

defendants, as per the contention taken by the

plaintiffs in the plaint.
</p>
<p id="p_40">     12.    Here on perusing the cross-examination of

PW1, there are so many admissions. In the cross-

examination he admitted that after death of his father

Mr.Kamalaksha Kini, he continued the same business

which was being carried on by his father. But in the

cross-examination of PW1, goes to show that his

mother, the 1st plaintiff has not given any authority to

this PW1 for conducting this case in respect of alleged

cheque     said    to   has   been    issued   by   defendants

dt.4.11.2008.
</p>
<p id="p_41">     13.    Now looking to the contents of Ex.P29, it is

not specifically mentioned that Ex.P29 has been

executed in favour of 2nd plaintiff i.e., PW1 for

conducting the case for recovery of money in respect of
                           {23}            O.S.No.7522/2011

the cheques said to has been issued by the defendants,

bearing   No.332406      and     332405     dt.4.11.2008.

Therefore PW1 deposed in his cross-examination at

page 10 that there was no any direct money transaction

held in between his mother, the 1st plaintiff and M/s

Krishna Creations which is the partnership firm of the

defendants. So here from the cross-examination of

PW1, he admitted that during the life time of his father,

he was doing the money-lending business. But no such

licence has been produced by PW1 as to show that his

father was doing money-lending business during his

life time. Here in the cross-examination of PW1, he

admitted that during the life time of his father, he

raised loan in Karnataka State Finance Corporation by

furnishing the property No.83/2 as collateral security

to the M/s Krishna Creations which is partnership firm

of the defendants. In this case, PW1 has not produced

any document as to show that his father was an

Income-tax assessee in order to prove that there was

money-lending business being carried on by his father

with the defendants. In the cross-examination of PW1
                             {24}          O.S.No.7522/2011

he admitted Ex.P27 which is Reconstitution Deed of

Partnership executed on 19.3.2004. As per clause 21 of

Ex.P27, it shows payment to the surety. Here on the

basis of collateral    security, the    Karnataka       State

Finance Corporation has sanctioned the finance for the

partnership firm of the defendants, but not to the

defendants individually. Therefore the person who has

given surety for raising the loan in Karnataka State

Finance Corporation has to get Rs.23,000/- p.m. and

said amount was enhanced to Rs.2,000/- annually

with effect from 1st April 2005 until the said security is

discharged from Karnataka State Finance Corporation.

Therefore in the cross-examination of PW1, he admitted

that though he was one of the partners in the

defendants'   partnership     firm,   there   is   no    any

responsibility on him with regard to Profit &amp; Loss. Here

as per Ex.P27, PW1 also become one of the partners.

PW1 also admitted that it was only decided to pay

interest to the person who offered surety of property

No.83/2 as a collateral security. Therefore in the cross-

examination of PW1, he admitted that the amount in
                                {25}            O.S.No.7522/2011

the manner of interest that was being paid as per

clause 21 mentioned on Ex.P27 is to be deposited in

the account of his mother i.e., plaintiff No.1. PW1 also

admitted that from the month of April, 2005 it was

decided that Rs.2000/- has to be enhanced per month

as per clause 21 of Ex.P27 to be paid to the plaintiffs.

Therefore PW1 in the cross-examination admitted that

in the year 2007, he asked the defendants' firm to

enhance the monthly amount being paid to his mother.

Therefore in the cross-examination of PW1 at page 14,

admitted that he asked the defendants' firm to

discharge the collateral security of the property bearing

No.83/2 belongs to them when the defendants fail to

enhance the monthly amount being paid to the 1st

plaintiff. PW1 also admitted that on 18.7.2007 the

property     No.83/2     which    has   been    deposited    as

collateral    security    in    Karnataka      State   Finance

Corporation has been discharged and also admitted

that there is a document to show that the property

No.83/2 has been discharged from Karnataka State

Finance Corporation by the defendants' firm. Here
                            {26}             O.S.No.7522/2011

Ex.D1 is the certified copy of the letter by Karnataka

State Finance Corporation, clearly goes to show that

property bearing No.5,83/2 has been discharged. This

has been identified by PW1 and the same is marked as

Ex.D1.
</p>
<p id="p_42">     14.     PW1 also admitted that prior to discharge of

collateral security, he was retired from the partnership

firm of the defendants on 12.7.2007 as per the

document executed in between the plaintiffs with the

defendants' firm which is marked as Ex.D2. So here it

was the condition of the father of PW1, during his life

time, to raise loan from Karnataka State Finance

Corporation by depositing the property belongs to the

plaintiffs   bearing   No.5,83/2   in   Karnataka      State

Finance Corporation if his son i.e., PW1 is taken as a

partner of the defendants' firm. So here as per the

Reconstitution Deed of Partnership dt.12.7.2007 as per

Ex.D2, PW1 is retired from the partnership firm and

there is no any transaction held in between the

plaintiffs and defendants till 18.7.2007.
</p><p id="p_43">                           {27}           O.S.No.7522/2011

</p><p id="p_44">     15.   So here on perusing the cross-examination of

PW1, the cheques bearing Nos.388440 and 388439

dt.4.11.2008 have been lost while plaintiffs were going

to present the said cheques in their bank i.e, Syndicate

Bank, Sheshadripuram branch. But here PW1 being

the educated person has not intimated the cheques lost

while they were going to present them, by writing to

Canara Bank, Seshadripuram branch, Bangalore in

which   bank   those   cheques   were   drawn    by   the

defendants, as per the contention of the plaintiffs.

Further the plaintiffs have not at all filed a police

complaint as to prove that the above said cheques were

lost while they were going to be presented for

encashment. Further the plaintiffs also not made any

attempt to intimate the above said fact to the

defendants by way of writing. This goes to show that

there was no any legal debt liability due from the

defendants.
</p>
<p id="p_45">     16.   Now it is pertinent to note that Ex.P28 is the

document prepared by PW1 himself. Therefore in the

cross-examination of PW1, he admitted that M/s Balaji
                           {28}               O.S.No.7522/2011

Creations Firm belongs to defendant No.3. PW1 also

admitted that there is no any transaction held with

M/s Balaji Creations Firm. However, surprisingly PW1

admitted that Ex.P1and P14 which are the cheques

were issued in the name of M/s Balaji Creations Firm.

Therefore the transaction was held in between M/s

Balaji Creations with M/s Krishna Creations. PW1

admitted that neither in the pleadings of the plaint nor

in the sworn affidavit it is mentioned about the cheques

issued in the name of M/s Balaji Creations Firm. Now

looking to Ex.P1, which is the cheque for Rs.6,34,493/-

issued by Proprietor of M/s Balaji Creations. But here

in the cross-examination of PW1, goes to show that

Proprietor of M/s Balaji Creations has issued Ex.P1

and also Ex.P14. Therefore in the Reconstitution Deed

of Partnership which is marked as Ex.P27, it clearly

goes to show that the defendants have settled all the

dues while PW1(plaintiff No.2) retired as a partner from

M/s   Krishna    Creations.      Therefore    under     these

circumstances in the year 2007, all the dues remained

to be paid to the Plaintiff has been discharged or settled
                            {29}            O.S.No.7522/2011

in the year 2007 only. Therefore there was no necessity

to issue a cheque for discharge of loan dt.4.11.2008

under cheques bearing Nos.332406 and 332405 both

dt.4.11.2008. So here Ex.P1 and Ex.P14 are issued by

Prop:M/s Balaji Creations. Under these circumstances

how far the defendants are responsible for discharging

the loan due to the cheques as per Ex.P1 and Ex.P14

have been dishonoured. So here on Ex.P27, PW1 also

put the signature. So under these circumstances when

PW1 retired from the partnership firm i.e., M/s Krishna

Creations by putting his signature on Ex.P27 agreeing

to the terms of the partnership firm regarding the full

and final settlement, then under such circumstances,

there is no any due loan amount remained by the side

of the defendants to be paid to the plaintiffs as urged in

the pleadings of the plaint and also in the sworn

affidavit of PW1. Here Ex.P2 is the endorsement. But

the cheque numbers as per Ex.P1 and Ex.P14 are not

mentioned on Ex.P2. Further on Ex.P2 there is no

designated signature of the Manager who has issued

the   endorsement     as   per    Ex.P2.    Under     these
                           {30}            O.S.No.7522/2011

circumstances Ex.P2 is also created document in order

to establish the false claim against the defendants.

Here PW1 is further chief-examined and Ex.P30 is

marked. Ex.P30 is the endorsement issued by Manager

of Canara Bank. Again PW1 was cross-examined. Even

PW1 admitted that on Ex.P30 it is not mentioned that

cheque    bearing   Nos.332406     and    332405     both

dt.4.11.2008 have been issued by the defendants. PW1

also produced Ex.D6 which is the statement of current

account of M/s Krishna Creations firm. PW1 also

admitted the statement of current account of M/s

Balaji Creations which is marked as Ex.D7. So here in

the pleading of the plaint, it is pleaded that the

cheques dt.4.11.2008 issued by the defendants, when

presented, have been dishonoured.        But here as per

Ex.P30 those cheques have been dishonoured due to

stop payment. But here in the pleadings of the plaint, it

is pleaded that the said cheques were dishonoured due

to 'insufficient funds' in the account of the defendants.

So there is a contradiction in the cross-examination of

PW1 and also in the pleadings pleaded in the plaint.
</p><p id="p_46">                          {31}           O.S.No.7522/2011

Looking to Ex.P13, goes to show that there is no

certainty with regard to cheques issued as per Ex.P1

and Ex.P14 have been dishonoured either due to

insufficient funds or there is a stopped payment as

directed by the drawer of the said cheques. Therefore

in the cross-examination of PW1 at page 18, he

admitted that there is no document to show that Ex.P1

and Ex.P14 have been issued by the defendants for

discharge of the suit claim. Further in the cross-

examination of PW1 at page 15, admitted that there are

criminal cases in C.C.No.16659/2009 and 16660/09

registered against the present defendants as accused in

respect of cheques issued as per Ex.P1 and Ex.P14 U/S

138 of N.I.Act. In those two criminal cases, the present

defendants, as accused, have been acquitted. The

certified copies of judgments are marked as Ex.D3 and

D4. Against the said Judgments, the present plaintiffs

preferred the appeal in Crl.Appeal No.93/13 and 94/13

before the Hon'ble High Court of Karnataka. Those two

criminal appeals also dismissed. The certified copies of

the judgments passed in above said Criminal Appeals
                            {32}            O.S.No.7522/2011

also produced. The certified copy of the judgment

passed in Crl.Nos.93/13 and 94/13 are marked as

Ex.D5. So here on perusal of oral evidence of PW1 and

admissions in the cross-examination of PW1, itself goes

to show that Ex.P1 and Ex.P14 are not issued by the

partners of M/s Krishna Creations i.e., defendants

towards discharge of the suit claim.
</p>
<p id="p_47">     17.   In this case even though the defendants filed

written statement, not adduced oral or documentary

evidence, but the documents by the side of the

defendants confronted to PW1 are marked as Ex.D1 to

D7. Further the admissions in the cross-examination of

PW1, itself sufficient that the plaintiffs by relying on the

false facts by creating Ex.P1 and Ex.P14 filed this false

suit claiming the false claim. Therefore viewed from any

angle and looking to the oral and documentary

evidence by the side of the plaintiffs, reveals that the

plaintiffs utterly failed to prove that the defendants are

liable to pay the suit claim. Hence I answered Issue

Nos.1 to 6 in the Negative.
</p>
<p id="p_48">     ADDITIONAL ISSUE NO.1:

defendants       at   para    4.1,    they   specifically   took

contention that the suit is barred by limitation. But

here in this case the suit filed by the plaintiffs is for

recovery of money due from the defendants. Here the

plaintiffs before filing the suit got issued notice as per

Ex.P3 dt.19.3.2009. So here even though taking the

date of issuance of cheques as per Ex.P1 and Ex.P14

dt.4.11.2008, the suit filed by the plaintiffs is within

three years from the date of refusal of the suit claim in

the reply notice got issued by the defendants as per

Ex.P13. Moreover there is no unequivocal evidence by

the side of the defendants since the defendants have

not stepped into the witness box as to prove that the

suit filed by the plaintiffs is barred by limitation. Hence

the defendants failed to prove additional Issue No.1.

Hence I answered additional Issue No.1 in the

Negative.
