<p id="p_1">                 None appears on behalf of the petitioners.                  We therefore

proceed to take the case on merits.
</p>
<p id="p_2">                 The petitioners impugn the order dated 29.07.2003 passed by

Central Administrative Tribunal, Chandigarh Bench (in short, 'the

Tribunal') as well as the subsequent orders dated 20.10.2003, whereby their

review application along with miscellaneous application for impleadment of

certain private persons as party-respondents in a decided case, were

dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_3">                 The facts as pleaded by the petitioners reveal that they were

employed as Casual Labourers in the office of Accountant General (Audit),
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                                                      -2-</span>
CWP NO.3107-CAT OF 2004




Haryana in the year 1996. It appears that the superior authority raised an

objection against engagement of the petitioners and other Casual Labourers

on muster roll and pursuant to such objections raised vide letter dated

01.09.2000, service of the petitioners were dispensed with on different dates

in February, March and May, 2001. It further appears that respondent no.4

meanwhile completed some selection process for appointments to Group D

posts and one or two persons mentioned in para 5 of the writ petition came

to be appointed on the basis of interview etc.

             The petitioners approached the Tribunal on two counts. Firstly,

they alleged that termination of their services was illegal. Secondly, after

terminating their service at least ten Casual Labourers were appointed on

regular basis as per details given in para 7 of the writ petition. Hence, they

too were entitled to not only reinstatement but for regularization of services

also.
</p>
<p id="p_4">             Respondents no.2, 3 and 4 have filed written statement,

maintaining that their action in dispensing with Daily Wagers employment

of the petitioners or in making certain appointments on regular basis was

strictly in accordance with law. It is explained that the post of Peons were

duly advertised against which all the seven petitioners applied. Petitioner

nos.1 to 6 were called for interview on 7th December, 1999, but they could

not be selected on the basis of their performance in the interview before the

Selection Committee. Petitioner no.7 was found to be over-age on the cut

off date i.e. 3rd November, 1999 and was not called for interview. It is thus

explained that the petitioners were duly considered in the regular selection

process but they could not make it to the selection list. As regard to Ambika

Prasad, it has been explained that he applied for the post of Chowkidar and

he was selected on the basis of interview held on 7th December, 1999. The

petitioners were not the candidates for the post of Chowkidar.               The

allegation made by the petitioners that some Casual Labourers were

appointed on regular basis has been controverted, explaining that some

Casual Labourers were engaged from time to time to the extent of

sanctioned posts.
</p>
<p id="p_5">             The Tribunal has turned down the claim of petitioners,

observing that they were appointed as Daily Wage Casual Labourers and had

no right to continue nor they could claim temporary or regularization in the

absence of any scheme to that effect.
</p>
<p id="p_6">             Having giving our thoughtful consideration to the issue raised

in this writ petition, we are of the view that no interference, by this Court in

the order passed by the tribunal, is called for. We say so for the reasons

that:-
</p>
<p id="p_7">   (i)       The petitioners were appointed as Daily Wage Casual

             Labourers without observing any transparent procedure. Merely

             because they continued for 4-5 years, would not clothe them

             with a vested right to seek appointment on regular basis.

</p><p id="p_8">   (ii)      The petitioners were given opportunity to compete on regular

             basis and except petitioner no.7, the others were duly

             considered but not found suitable. Petitioner no.7 could not be

             considered as he had become overage. It is further evident that
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                                                                               -4-</span>

                                       even after termination of their services they were again

                                       considered and some of them were called for interview on 15th

                                       October, 2001 but again they could not be selected for the

                                       reasons that either they had become overage or did not perform

                                       well in the interview before the Selection Committee. The

                                       respondents thus having followed the procedure consistent with

                                       Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India, no fault can be

                                       found in their action.
</p>
<p id="p_9">                           (iii)       It is not their case that there was any policy under which the

                                       petitioners could claim regularization on completion of

                                       particular length of service or that any similarly placed person

                                       has been made regular.
</p>
<p id="p_10">                                       In these circumstances, we do not find any merit in this writ

                           petition which is accordingly dismissed.</p><pre id="pre_2">
