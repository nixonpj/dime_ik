                                 Criminal Miscellaneous No.12019 of 2011
                   ======================================================
                   1. Raghuvansh Rai S/O Late Sewak Rai @ Sewaklal Rai Resident Of
                   Village- Mohanpur, P.S.- Bidupur, District- Vaishali.

                                                                        .... ....   Petitioner/s

                   CORAM: HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE SHIVAJI PANDEY
                   ORAL ORDER</pre>

<p id="p_1">3   17-07-2012                    Heard learned counsel for the petitioner and learned

                       counsel for the State.
</p>
<p id="p_2">                                 This application has been filed for quashing the

                       order dated 11.2.2011 passed in S.T. No. 370 of 2008 by the

                       learned Additional Sessions Judge-II, Vaishali at Hajipur by

                       which the court below has refused to allow to recall P.Ws. 8

                       and 9 for cross-examination.
</p>
<p id="p_3">                                    Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that as

                       Senior Counsel was busy in another court and as such P.Ws.

                       8 and 9 could not be cross-examined. He further submits

                       that if the petitioner would not be allowed to cross-examine

                       these two witnesses it would cause irreparable injury and for

                       the ends of justice the court below ought to have allowed

                       these two witnesses for cross-examination. It appears from
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1"> Patna High Court Cr.Misc. No.12019 of 2011 (3) dt.17-07-2012</span>




                 the impugned order that P.Ws.8 and 9 was discharged

                 without cross-examination as the court below rejected the

                 prayer of adjournment on behalf of the petitioner on the

                 ground that Sr. counsel was busy in another court and that

                 was not be a good ground for recall of P.Ws. 8 and 9 for

                 cross-examination and the petition of recall was dismissed

                 without having any merit. He further submits that the

                 witnesses could not be cross-examined not due to the fault

                 of the party but due to non-availability of Sr. counsel and if

                 these witnesses who are essential would not be cross-

                 examined it will be completely failure of justice and would

                 cause irreparable injury to defence and as such the court

                 below for the ends of justice was required to allow his

                 prayer for their cross-examination.
</p>
<p id="p_4">                            Learned counsel for the State has refuted the

                 argument advanced by learned counsel for the petitioner and

                 has submitted that the reason that has been shown by the

                 court below can be said to be a good ground. If the lawyer is

                 busy in another court that can not be a ground for

                 adjournment of the case.
</p>
<p id="p_5">                            Having considered the rival contention of the

                 parties, under <a href="/doc/1780550/" id="a_1">section 311</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2"> Patna High Court Cr.Misc. No.12019 of 2011 (3) dt.17-07-2012</span>




                 the legislature has given power to the court to allow the

                 examination and cross-examination and re-examination of

                 witnesses to secure the ends of justice if the court finds that

                 they are essential for examination or cross-examination in

                 that circumstance the court should exercise power and recall

                 them for further cross examination. In this connection a

                 reference may be made to the judgment of the Hon'ble

                 Supreme Court in the case of U.T. of Dadra &amp; Haveli &amp;

                 Anr. Vs. Fatehsinh Mohansinh Chauhan, reported in 2007(1)

                 P.L.J.R. 10 SC. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in paragraph 11

                 of the aforesaid judgment has held as follows:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">                             "11. <a href="/doc/171510013/" id="a_2">In Mohanlal Shamji Soni vs. Union of
                       India &amp; Anr</a>. AIR 1991 SC 1346 it was observed
                       that it is a cardinal rule in the law of evidence that
                       the best available evidence should be brought
                       before the Court to prove a fact or the points in
                       issue. But it is left either for the prosecution or for
                       the defence to establish its respective case by
                       adducing the best available evidence and the
                       Court is not empowered under the provisions<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_3"> of
                       the Code</a> to compel either the prosecution or the
                       defence to examine any particular witness or
                       witnesses on their sides. It is the duty of a Court
                       not only to do justice but also to ensure that
                       justice is being done. It was further held that the
                       second part of the Section does not allow for any
                       discretion but it binds and compels the Court to
                       take any of the aforementioned two steps if the
                       fresh evidence to be obtained is essential to the
                       just decision of the case. It was emphasized that
                       power is circumscribed by the principle that
                       underlines <a href="/doc/1780550/" id="a_4">Section 311</a> Cr.P.C., namely, evidence
                       to be obtained should appear to the court essential
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3"> Patna High Court Cr.Misc. No.12019 of 2011 (3) dt.17-07-2012</span>




                       to a just decision of the case by getting at the truth
                       by all lawful means. Further, that the power must
                       be used judicially and not capriciously or
                       arbitrarily. It was further observed that evidence
                       should not be received as a disguise for a retrial or
                       to change the nature of the case against either of
                       the parties and the discretion of the Court must
                       obviously be dictated by exigency of the situation
                       and fair play and good sense appear to be the safe
                       guides and that only the requirement of justice
                       command the examination of any person which
                       would depend on the facts and circumstances of
                       each case.....
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">                       "7. It is a common experience in criminal courts
                       that defence counsel would raise objections
                       wherever courts exercise powers under <a href="/doc/1780550/" id="a_5">Section
                       311</a> of the Code or under <a href="/doc/302809/" id="a_6">Section 165</a> of the
                       Evidence Act, 1872 by saying that the court could
                       not " fill the lacuna in the prosecution case". A
                       lacuna in the prosecution is not to be equated with
                       the fallout of an oversight committed by a Public
                       Prosecutor during trial, either in producing
                       relevant materials or in eliciting relevant answers
                       from witnesses. The adage "to err is human" is the
                       recognition of the possibility of making mistakes
                       to which humans are prone. A corollary of any
                       such laches or mistakes during the conducting of a
                       case cannot be understood as a lacuna which a
                       court cannot fill up.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">                       8. Lacuna in the prosecution must be understood
                       as the inherent weakness or a latent wedge in the
                       matrix of the prosecution case. The advantage of
                       it should normally go to the accused in the trial of
                       the case, but an oversight in the management of
                       the prosecution cannot be treated as irreparable
                       lacuna. No party in a trial can be foreclosed from
                       correcting errors. If proper evidence was not
                       adduced or a relevant material was not brought on
                       record due to any inadvertence, the court should
                       be magnanimous in permitting such mistakes to
                       be rectified. After all, function of the criminal
                       court is administration of criminal justice and not
                       to count errors committed by the parties or to find
                       out and declare who among the parties performed

                       better."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">                          Finally, it was held that the prosecution that
                       the Court cannot exercise power of re-summoning
                       any witness if once that power was exercised,
                       cannot be accepted nor can the power be whittled
                       down merely on the ground that the prosecution
                       discovered laches only when the defence
                       highlighted them during arguments. Similar view
                       has been taken in P. Chhaganlal Daga Vs. M.
                       Sanjay Shaw (2003) 11 SCC 486 where
                       permission granted by the Court to a complainant
                       to produce additional material after evidence had
                       been closed and case was posted for judgment
                       was upheld repelling the contention that
                       production of the document at that belated stage
                       would amount to filling in a lacuna."

<blockquote id="blockquote_5">                           The court has not accepted the plea of petitioner for

                 recalling his witnesses for cross-examination on the ground

                 that Sr. counsel was busy in another court but he has not

                 considered this aspect of matter that cross-examination of

                 P.Ws. 8 and 9 would render the failure of justice. Every

                 party must get chance to place their all cards so that he may

                 not feel of being deprived of justice. It is well known
