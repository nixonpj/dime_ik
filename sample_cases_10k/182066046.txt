</p><p id="p_2">                          2.The case of the revision petitioner/plaintiff is that he filed

                     the above suit against the respondent/defendant for recovery of

                     money.    After examination of three witnesses on the side of the

                     plaintiff, the plaintiff filed a memo stating that the parties settled

                     the matter out of court and sought for refund of court fees.

                     Though the Court below dismissed the suit based on the memo filed

                     by the plaintiff, it refused to entertain the relief of refund of the

                     court fee in view of Section 69-A of the Tamil Nadu Court Fees and

                     <a href="/doc/867444/" id="a_2">Suits Valuation Act</a>, 1955 amended Act 2017, against which, the

                     petitioner/plaintiff has filed this revision petition. In support of the

                     contention, he relied on the following judgments:-

                     not referred to any modes of settlement contemplated in Section 89

                     of the Civil Procedure Code and therefore, the plaintiff is not

                     entitled to refund of court fee under Section 69-A of the Tamil Nadu

                     Court Fees and <a href="/doc/867444/" id="a_4">Suits Valuation Act</a>. Under Section 69 of the Tamil

                     Nadu Court Fees and <a href="/doc/867444/" id="a_5">Suits Valuation Act</a>, if no evidence is recorded

                     on the merits of the claim, then, full court fee can be refunded, but

                     the learned Judge finding that the plaintiff has examined three

                     witnesses in chief in the form of filing affidavit which are related to

                     the main facts of the issue, held that the petitioner is not entitled

                     for refund of court fee and dismissed the application against which,

                     the present revision petition has been filed.



</p><p id="p_8">                          4.In my considered opinion, three witnesses have been

                     examined in chief, only by filing affidavits and they were not even

                     cross examined, before that, the matter has been settled out of

                     court and therefore, the petitioner is entitled for refund of the court

                     fee which is also fortified by the judgment reported in 2015 (2)

                     TNLJ 63, <a href="/doc/53458325/" id="a_6">N.J.Senthil Kumar vs. N.B.Subash</a>.        It is worthwhile to

                     extract below the following paragraphs of the above judgment:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">                                ''8.At this juncture, the learned counsel for the
                          appellant would submit that the entire court fee paid
                          may be refunded to him in view of the judgement of this
                          court in Venkatachalam and others v. Sengoda Gounder
                          and others, 2014 (6) CTC 216. In para 7 of the said
                          judgement, this court has held as follows:-

<p id="p_9">http://www.judis.nic.in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                                      4</span>

</p><p id="p_10">                                       7. In this case, though the matter is not
                          settled through Lok Adalat, parties themselves have
                          come forward for listing the matter before this Court.
                          Even though the matter was not referred before Lok
                          Adalat, the parties settled the matter voluntarily, and it
                          has to be encouraged, otherwise the parties will not
                          come forward to settle the matter and they will get a
                          reference to the Lok Adalat. Thereafter, they will seek
                          full Court-fee. To avoid such situation, the court referred
                          the matter to Lok Adalat under Section 89 of CPC. This
                          court is having ample power to grant full Court-fee in
                          case of settlement between parties, even without any
                          reference to the Lok Adalat. Therefore, this court directs
                          the Registry to refund the full court-fee in this matter.
</p><p id="p_11">                                 9.In the instant case also, though the matter has
                          not been referred to the Lok Adalat and settled before
                          the Lok Adalat, since it has been settled out of court
                          between the parties, applying the decision in
                          Venkatachalam's case [cited supra], I am inclined to
                          issue a direction to the Registry to refund the entire
                          court-fee paid in this second appeal to the appellant.
</p><p id="p_12">                                 10.In the result, the second appeal is dismissed as
                          settled out of court. The appellant/plaintiff is at liberty
                          to make appropriate application before the first
                          appellate for refund of Rs.9,62,998/- lying in the credit
                          of the said court which was deposited by the defendant
                          as per the direction of the first appellate court. If any
                          such application is made by the appellant/plaintiff the
                          first appellate court shall refund the said amount to him
                          without there being any need to issue notice to the
                          respondent/defendant. The Registry is directed to
                          refund the entire court fee paid in this second appeal to
                          the appellant herein. Consequently, connected MP is
                          closed.''
