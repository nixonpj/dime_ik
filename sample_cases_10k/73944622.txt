P.C:

</pre><p id="p_1">1.      Leave to amend in terms of the draft amendment handed over by

the learned Counsel for the petitioner. Amendment be carried out on or

before 1 February 2019. Amended copy of the petition be served on all

the parties. Mr.Kanade, learned Counsel for the petitioner submits that




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">::: Uploaded on - 31/01/2019                     ::: Downloaded on - 01/02/2019 00:48:14 :::</span>
 pvr                                  2         3carap54-18-carbp147-18-chscdl414-18

an additional affidavit of the respondent was received by his clients

yesterday and he needs to take instructions on the said affidavit.

</p><p id="p_2">2.       A perusal of the record indicates that the matter is pending for

quite some time, various orders in this petition came to be passed by this

Court, the first order was passed on 1 November 2017 (K.R.Shriram, J.).

There are further orders which are passed which clearly indicate that

there are issues which according to the petitioner is causing serious

prejudice to the petitioner. Also the respondent has not paid the arrears

of rent which are also commented in the earlier orders passed by this

court.
</p>
<p id="p_3">3.       On the earlier occasions, hearing of this petition was adjourned as

the respondent took a position that the issues would be resolved and

that further steps would be taken to complete the project.

</p><p id="p_4">4.       Mr.Kanade, learned Counsel for the petitioner on instructions had

submitted that his clients were not ready to accept the suggestions

which were made on behalf of the respondent and in fact it was the

contention on behalf of Mr.Kanade that repeatedly the undertakings

were breached by the respondent.
</p>
<p id="p_5">5.       It also appears that despite several last adjournments, a final

settlement could not be brought about. There are also interveners who

are stated to be third parties/flat purchasers who have filed chamber

summons. The respondent also agreed to resolve the issues of these




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">::: Uploaded on - 31/01/2019                   ::: Downloaded on - 01/02/2019 00:48:14 :::</span>
 pvr                                3         3carap54-18-carbp147-18-chscdl414-18

applicants in these chamber summons.        However, it appears that in

respect of these applicants whose chamber summonses are pending, the

issues are still not resolved.
</p>
<p id="p_6">6.      Mr.Kanade, learned Counsel for the petitioner submits that the

chamber summons as moved on behalf of the applicant is not

maintainable in this proceedings as these are third parties.                  It is

submitted that these applicants have independent rights and they are

not in any manner concerned with the present proceedings which as

initiated by the petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_7">7.      Mr.Kanade, learned Counsel for the petitioner contends that on

the adjourned hearing his client would be pressing for the reliefs as

made in the amended prayer and more particularly prayer clause (N), if

the issues are not resolved. The parties are accordingly put to notice that

the prayers as made by the petitioner would be considered on the

adjourned date of hearing and an endeavour shall be to finally decide

these proceedings.
</p>
<p id="p_8">8.      On the above background, it needs to be observed that these

proceedings are pending for quite some time. They cannot remain

indefinitely pending and are required to be adjudicated. As a final

chance in the true sense of the term, the proceedings are adjourned to 6

February 2019 to enable Mr.Kanade to take instructions on the

additional affidavit filed by the respondent. Mr.Damle learned Senior




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">::: Uploaded on - 31/01/2019                 ::: Downloaded on - 01/02/2019 00:48:14 :::</span>

Counsel for the respondent is quite hopeful that issues would be

resolved on the petitioner considering the additional affidavit.

</p><p id="p_9">9.      Respondent is permitted to file additional affidavit in the office. If

the respondent wants to file a further affidavit in responding to the

additional prayers as made by the petitioner, they shall do so well in

advance before the returnable date.
</p>
<p id="p_10">10.     Petitioner is also permitted to file additional affidavit on or before

1 February 2019, if it so desires.
</p>
<p id="p_11">11.       Stand over to 6 February 2019 (High on Board) alongwith

Commercial arbitration application no.54 of 2018 and pending chamber

summonses.
