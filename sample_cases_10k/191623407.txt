</pre>

<p id="p_1">           1.     The brief facts necessary for the disposal of the

           present case are that plaintiff is the owner of Flat No. 501

           A, Fifth Floor, Block A shown in the layout plan of Climax

           Co­operative Group Housing Society Ltd presently known

           as Balaji Apartments situated at Plot No. 11/2, Sector

           Rohini, Delhi 85 ( herein after called suit property ).

</p><p id="p_2">           2.     Plaintiff let out the aforesaid suit property to the

           defendant vide rent agreement dt. 12.07.2016 upon

           certain terms and conditions to the defendant for a period

           of 11 months at a monthly rent of Rs.37,000/­ but the

           defendant started to make default in payment of rent since

           August 2016. Plaintiff issued legal notice dt. 27.11.2016

           upon the defendant to which defendant issued two

           cheques dt. 18.12.216 and 10.01.2017 for the sum of



Sunil Kumar Vs. Rajan Kumar Singh                                Page No. 2/7
            Rs.74,000/­ each towards arrears of rent from August

           2016 to November 2016 but the aforementioned cheques

           were dishonoured and as contended in the plaint, the

           plaintiff had initiated legal proceedings under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_1">Section 138</a>

           of NI Act against the defendant. Plaintiff made several

           requests to the defendant but all in vain and a legal notice

           dt. 11.01.2017 was again served upon the defendant with

           regard to payment of arrears of rent and termination of

           tenancy. Hence, this suit.
</p>
<p id="p_3">           3.     The plaint was filed with the following prayer :

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">                  (i) to pass a decree of possession in respect of suit

                  property in favour of plaintiff.

</blockquote>

                  favour of plaintiff restraining the defendant and his

                  agents from creating third party interest qua suit

                  property.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_4">           4.     Summons of the suit and notice of application under



Sunil Kumar Vs. Rajan Kumar Singh                               Page No. 3/7
            Order XXXIX Rule 1 &amp; 2 CPC were served upon the

           defendant, but no written statement was filed on behalf of

           defendant and his defence was struck off vide order dt.

           13.11.2018.
</p>
<p id="p_5">           5.     Plaintiff has appeared in the witness box as only

           witness and examined himself as PW 1 by way of affidavit

           which is Ex. PW 1/A. He has relied upon documents :

           Conveyance Deed - Ex. PW 1/1 ( OSR ), Rent Agreement

           dt. 12.07.2016 - Ex. PW 1/ 2 ( OSR ), Site plan - Ex. PW

           1/ 3, Notice Dt. 27.11.2016 - Ex. PW 1/ 4 ( OSR ),

           Photocopy of cheque dt. 18.12.2016­ MARK A, Photocopy

           of cheque dt. 10.01.2017­ MARK B, Complaint under

           C, Complaint under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_3">Section 138</a> of NI Act qua cheque dt.

           PW 1/ 9.
</p>
<p id="p_6">           6.     After leading the ex­parte plaintiff evidence, the case

           was fixed for ex­parte final arguments.

</p><p id="p_7">           7.     Having heard the arguments advanced by the Ld.

           counsel for the plaintiff and after going through the case

           file as well as the documents placed on record by the

           plaintiff, this Court is of the considered view that plaintiff



Sunil Kumar Vs. Rajan Kumar Singh                               Page No. 4/7
            has placed on record Conveyance deed i.e.                Ex.PW 1/1

           (OSR)      whereby       plaintiff   establishes   the   factum       of

           ownership/ allotment of suit property in his favour.

           Plaintiff has also placed on record Rent agreement Ex. PW

           1/ 2 which proves the relationship of landlord and tenant

           between the plaintiff and the defendant and the rent @

           Rs.37000/­ for a period of 11 months. Further more, Ex.

           PW 1/4 (OSR) is the legal notice issued by the plaintiff one

           month prior from the date of asking for termination of

           tenancy upon the defendant in view of condition laid down

           in the rent agreement Ex.PW 1/ 2. Moreover, Mark A and

           Mark B further strengthen the version of plaintiff that the

           same were issued by the defendant in discharge of his

           liability as arrears of rent. Mark C and Mark D are the

           complaint filed by the plaintiff under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_4">Section 138</a> of NI Act.

           Issuance of legal notice dt. 11.01.2017 ­ Ex. PW 1/9

           authorised the plaintiff to initiate the legal proceedings

           upon     the    defendant      for   the   defaults   done   by     the

           defendant. Hence, plaintiff has successfully proved his

           case against the defendant. As the defendant did not

           bother to appear, his defence was struck off, testimony of

           PW­1       remained       unchallenged,      uncontroverted        and



Sunil Kumar Vs. Rajan Kumar Singh                                       Page No. 5/7
            unrebutted as the defendant was proceeded ex­parte

           during the proceedings.
</p>
<p id="p_8">           8.     In view of above observations, the suit of the plaintiff

           is decreed in his favour and against the defendant.

           Therefore, defendant is directed to handover the peaceful,

           vacant, physical possession of the suit property i.e. Flat
