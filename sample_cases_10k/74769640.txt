ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">              The present application U/s 9 of the Arbitration and <a href="/doc/1306164/" id="a_1">Conciliation Act</a>, 1996
is filed by the petitioner alongwith an application for ex-parte appointment of receiver to
take the possession of the vehicle make SPLENDOR PLUS CAST, bearing
Registration No. DL3SBY-9669, Chassis No. MBLHA10AM09D00021, Engine No.
HA10EJC9C06175.
</p>
<p id="p_2">              Heard ld. counsel for the petitioner on the application U/s 9 of the
Arbitration and <a href="/doc/1306164/" id="a_2">Conciliation Act</a>, 1996.
</p>
<p id="p_3">              The petitioner had financed a sum of Rs.31,356/- to the respondent for
the purchase of above referred vehicle on execution of documents, details of which are
given in the application. In pursuance to the loan agreement the respondent agreed to
adhere to the repayment schedule and entered into a vehicle loan-cum-hypothecation
agreement. The loan amount was agreed to be paid in 12 installments of Rs.2613/-
each.   It is submitted by ld. counsel that the respondent has not adhered to the


                         Shri Ram City Union Finance Vs. Dinesh Kumar
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                              -: 2 :-</span>

repayment schedule and has defaulted in repayment of 08 monthly installments and a
sum of Rs.23,462/- is due from him on the date of filing of the petition. In this regard
authorised representative of the petitioner has filed his affidavit in support of the amount
due from the respondent. It is further submitted on behalf of the petitioner that despite
service of demand notice respondent did not come forward to clear the outstanding
amount. Hence there is an apprehension that respondent might sell the vehicle. In that
case it would not be possible to recover the loan amount from the respondent.
Therefore, a prayer is made for appointment of receiver who shall take the
possession/interim custody of the abovesaid vehicle.
</p>
<p id="p_4">              I have heard the arguments on behalf of the petitioner and gone through
the record carefully.
</p>
<p id="p_5">              The claim of the petitioner is supported by necessary documents.
Respondent is alleged to have failed to comply with the terms and conditions of the loan
agreement. The vehicle was hypothecated to the petitioner. As the respondent prima
facie failed to comply with the terms and conditions of the loan agreement, the
agreement was terminated by the petitioner by serving legal notice.           There is an
arbitration clause in the agreement between the parties.
</p>
<p id="p_6">              Considering all the documents placed on record and the facts and
circumstances I am satisfied that it is a fit case where before issuing notice to the
respondent a receiver be appointed to take possession/interim custody of the vehicle.
Hence, I allow the application U/s 9 of the Arbitration and <a href="/doc/1306164/" id="a_3">Conciliation Act</a>, 1996 and
appoint Sh.Gagan Deep Singh, as receiver with a direction to take back the
possession/custody of vehicle make SPLENDOR PLUS CAST, bearing Registration
No.    DL3SBY-9669,       Chassis      No.       MBLHA10AM09D00021,         Engine      No.
HA10EJC9C06175, from whosoever and wheresoever is in possession of the vehicle till
the next date of the case. The receiver shall keep the vehicle in safe custody and shall
not dispose of the same without the permission of the court. He shall produce the same
in the court as and when directed and shall also file the report within three days of the


                         Shri Ram City Union Finance Vs. Dinesh Kumar

seizure of the vehicle in the court.
</p>

<p id="p_7">                 At the time of seizure of the vehicle the receiver shall issue appropriate
receipt to the person from whose custody the vehicle is taken, shall get the vehicle
photographed and shall note down the reading of the odometer and shall also get the
vehicle inspected from an authorised work shop with respect to the condition of the
vehicle and make a full inventory of the accessories affixed on the vehicle. He shall not
use the vehicle for any purpose whatsoever and he shall ensure that the vehicle is kept
in same condition in which it was received by him.
</p>
<p id="p_8">                 In case the payment of due installments upto the date of the seizure of
the vehicle is made by the respondent to the petitioner, the petitioner shall issue receipt
of the said payment and the order of seizure shall not be enforced and if he has already
seized the vehicle then the vehicle shall be released to the respondent immediately
without delay.
</p>
<p id="p_9">                 The receiver shall furnish a security bond in the sum of Rs.23,462/- in the
court.
</p>
<p id="p_10">                 The receiver is also granted permission to take assistance of the police, if
required, for the purpose of seizure of the vehicle.
</p>
<p id="p_11">                 Nothing in this order shall tantamount to expression of my opinion on the
final merits of the case.
