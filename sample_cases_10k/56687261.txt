<p id="p_1">                            There is a sole petitioner and there are three respondents in this original

                      petition.
</p>
<p id="p_2">


</p><p id="p_3">                            2.     This Original Petition has been filed under <a href="/doc/1722761/" id="a_3">Section 34</a> of The

                      Arbitration and <a href="/doc/1306164/" id="a_4">Conciliation Act</a>, 1996 (26 of 1996), hereinafter referred to as

                      'A&amp;C Act' for the sake of convenience and clarity laying a challenge to an

                      award dated 10.04.2018 made by an Arbitral Tribunal constituted by a sole

                      arbitrator. This award dated 10.04.2018 made by a sole arbitator constituting

                      the Arbitral Tribunal shall hereinafter be referred to as 'impugned award' for

                      the sake of convenience and clarity. To be noted, sole arbitrator has been

                      arrayed as respondent No.3 in this petition before me.




</p><p id="p_4">                            3.     Before I proceed with this petition, it is deemed appropriate to

                      mention at the outset that this petition being one under Section 34 of A&amp;C Act

                      is neither an appeal nor a revision, it is not a review and it is a mere challenge

                      to an arbitral award. More importantly, minimum judicial intervention in

                      Alternate Dispute Resolution mechanisms ('ADR' for brevity), in my considered

                      opinion, is the salutary principle and sublime philosophy underlying the scheme

                      of A&amp;C Act and more particularly, Sections 34 and 37 of A&amp;C Act. It is in this

                      backdrop that this petition under Section 34 of A&amp;C Act is being examined.

                      dated 22.08.2015 invoking the arbitration clause. A perusal of the arbitration

                      clause would reveal that an arbitrator has to be appointed by the builder. In

                      this notice dated 22.08.2015, proposed buyers have specifically referred to

                      clause 55 and called upon the builder to nominate a sole arbitrator in

                      accordance with clause 55. There is no dispute or disagreement before this

                      Court that this notice was duly received by the builder on 24.08.2015, but the

                      builder did not nominate an arbitrator in accordance with clause 55, which is

                      in the arbitration agreement between the parties within the meaning of

                      22.08.2015 when the notice invoking arbitration clause (alluded to supra) was

                      issued whereas the claim was made only on 25.02.2017.

                      Section 21 of A&amp;C Act is couched, arbitration did not commence on

                      22.08.2015, but on 24.08.2015 when the notice invoking arbitration clause was

                      received by the builder/petitioner, who is the noticee therein.    Therefore,

                      24.08.2015 is the reckoning date.

                      reveals that learned Arbitrator has infact considered the limitation issue and

                      has returned a finding.      With regard to the basis for learned Arbitrator

                      returning a finding that arbitration is not barred by limitation, 18.10.2012 has

                      been taken as the reckoning date by the learned Arbitrator. In other words,

                      learned Arbitrator has negatived the plea of the builder/petitioner that

                      06.07.2012 (termination notice) should be taken as the reckoning date.

                      Learned Arbitrator has referred to the electronic mails exchanged between the

                      parties and those electronic mails have been marked as Ex.C8 series before

                      learned Arbitrator. After scrutiny of electronic mails which have been marked

                      as Ex.C8 series, i.e., after appreciation of documentary evidence before him,

                      learned Arbitrator has come to the conclusion and returned a clear finding that

                      this Ex.C8 series is dated 18.10.2012 and that should be the reckoning date as

                      it is in these communications that the petitioner/builder finally informed the

                      proposed buyers that there is no amount refundable. In my considered view,

                      this finding of learned arbitrator cannot be faulted with.




</p><p id="p_89">                            (o)    Further to be noted, in this case limitation is a mixed question of

                      fact and law. Limitation being a mixed question of fact and law, this finding

                      returned by the learned Arbitrator with regard to issue No.3 which has been

                      answered in paragraph No.29, is clearly a question that turns on facts. In this

                      regard, this Court considers it appropriate to respectfully follow the ratio laid

                      down by Honourable Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/31621011/" id="a_12">Associate Builders V. Delhi

                      Development Authority</a>. To be noted, Associate Builders' case has been reported

                      contract by Delhi Development Authority ('DDA' for brevity) made a claim

                      towards work done. This was part of a project of DDA wherein about 7000

                      houses were being constructed by DDA in Trilok Puri, a Trans-Yamuna area. As

                      many as 15 claims were made by the contractor and Delhi High Court

                      appointed a Sole Arbitrator. The Sole Arbitrator entered upon reference and

                      passed an award which was called in question. A learned Single Judge of Delhi

                      High Court refused to intervene qua the award, but a Division Bench of Delhi

                      High Court, in an appeal under Section 37 of A&amp;C Act, stepped in to set aside

                      the view of the learned Single Judge. In other words, the claims of contractor

                      which were acceded to by the Arbitral Tribunal (which learned Single Judge

                      refused to set aside) were reversed/negatived. Besides this, two claims were

                      also scaled down. This order of the Division Bench of Delhi High Court was

                      called in question before the Honourable Supreme Court. In this backdrop,

                      Honourable Supreme Court in Associate Builders' case held that the expression

                      'justice' when it comes to setting aside an award under <a href="/doc/536284/" id="a_13">Section 34</a>, can only

                      mean that it should be an award, which is such that it shocks the conscience of

                      the Court.   It was also lucidly explained with erudition by the Honourable

                      Supreme Court that it cannot possibly include what the Court thinks is unjust

                      on the facts of a case for which it then seeks to substitute its views for the

                      Arbitrator's views and does what it considers to be justice . The Honourable

                      Supreme Court has also held in categoric terms that findings of facts made by

                      the Arbitrator cannot be interfered with as it was clearly laid down that the

                      Arbitrator is the sole Judge of the quantity and quality of evidence before him.

                      Though Associate Builders' case was rendered prior to 23.10.2015, these

                      Tribunal, in this regard, would amount to interfering with the quality and

                      quantity of evidence before him. When the learned Arbitrator has clearly

                      returned a finding that 06.07.2012       is not     the recknoning date and only

                      18.10.2012 is the reckoning date after careful analysis and appreciation of

                      been reported in 2018 9 SCC 472, the equivalent being AIR 2018 SC 3862,

                      3894. Though Bihar Rajya Bhumi Vikas Bank Samiti's case is one that turns on

                      interpretation of sub-section (5) of Section 34 of A&amp;C Act and as to whether

                      the pre-notice contemplated therein is directory or mandatory, in paragraph

                                  party by the applicant, or by the Court, as the case may be.

                                  In case the Court issues notice after the period mentioned

                                  in <a href="/doc/1211292/" id="a_19">Section 34(3)</a> has elapsed, every court shall endeavour

                                  to dispose of the <a href="/doc/536284/" id="a_20">Section 34</a> application within a period of

                                  one year from the date of filing of the said application,

                                  similar to what has been provided in Section 14 of the

                                  Commercial      Courts,     Commercial       Division     and

                                  Commercial Appellate Division of High Courts Act, 2015.

                                  This will give effect to the object sought to be achieved by

                                  adding <a href="/doc/1253821/" id="a_21">Section 13(6)</a> by the 2015 <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_22">Amendment Act</a>."

                      project has been completed and sold to another third party. It may not be

                      necessary to go into those aspects considering the narrow scope of Section 34

                      of A&amp;C Act, but a passing reference to the same is made only in terms of

                      equities of the matter which have also been noticed.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">                                                            29</span>

                            In the light of the narrative supra, particularly, "Discussion and

                      Dispositive Reasoning", this Court is convinced that this petition under Section

                      34 of A&amp;C Act which according to petitioner's counsel is predicated under Rule

                      2-A of Section 34 of A&amp;C Act is bereft of merits and does not warrant judicial

                      intervention qua the impugned award.        As a necessary sequitur, instant

                      petition is liable to be dismissed. However, considering the fair submissions

                      that have been made at the bar, this Court refrains from imposing costs.
