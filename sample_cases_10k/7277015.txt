                                 SA 2599/<a href="/doc/151186460/" id="a_1">2018
                        Balmukund vs. Sukku and Others
Gwalior</a>, dtd. 27/08/2019
      Shri DD Bansal, Counsel for the appellant.

      Heard on the question of admission.

      This Second Appeal under Section 100 of CPC has been filed against the

judgment and decree dated 07/08/2018, passed by First Additional District Judge,

Ganj Basoda, District Vidisha in RCA No.105-A/2016 thereby affirming the judgment

and decree dated 10th March, 2016 passed by Civil Judge, Class-I, Ganj Basoda,

District Vidisha in Civil Suit No.06-A of 2014.

      The necessary facts for disposal of the present appeal in short are that the

plaintiff/ appellant had filed a suit for declaration of title and permanent injunction

with respect to agricultural land bearing survey no.335/1, area 1.966 hectares situated

in Village Pali, Tahsil Shamshabad, District Vidisha as well as with respect to land

bearing survey nos.118 and 129, total area 25.454 hectares situated in Village Baroda,

Tahsil Shamshabad, District Vidisha. The plaintiff had claimed himself to be the

owner and in possession of 1.996 hectares of land situated in Village Pali, Tahsil

Shamshabad, District Vidisha and 5.046 hectares of land situated in Village Baroda,

Tahsil Shamshabad, District Vidisha, total 7.030 hectares of land situated in both the

villages. The above-mentioned land is the disputed land.

      It was the case of the plaintiff/appellant that Mishrilal, Sukku, Narayan,

Balmukund, Gopal, Jawahar, Ramkunwar Bai and Imrati Bai were the children of

Bhavani. Mishrilal had expired in the year 1984 and defendant No.6 Vinay Singh and

Lalaram are his legal representatives. Lalaram has expired in the year 2002 and
                                           2

defendants No.7 &amp; 8, namely, Malkhan and Bhujji are his legal representatives. Imrati

Bai has expired in the year 1996 but was succeeded by her son Mushilal as legal

representative. Mushilal has also expired in the year 1998 and his daughter Kapuri

Bai is the defendant No.13. The legal representatives of Mushilal are Jagmohan

(defendant No.9), Krishna Bai (defendant No.10), Urmila Bai (defendant No.11) and

Bimla Bai (defendant No.12). Ramkunwar Bai, widow of Mushilal, has already

expired in the year 2000. Bhavani was the owner and in possession of 25.454 hectares

of land situated in village Baroda and Village Pali, Tahsil Shamshabad, District

Vidisha. Survey No.118 area 16.628 hectares and survey no.129 area 6.855 hectares,

total area 23.454 hectares of land were situated in Village Baroda, Tahsil

Shamshabad, District Vidisha and half of 3.391 hectares of land is situated in Village

Pali, Tahsil Shamshabad, District Vidisha.

      Bhavani had two wives and Mishrilal was born out from his first wife and in

the year 1968, Bhavani after giving 1.254 hectares of land which was situated in

Village Pali, had separated the family of Mishrilal and from thereafter, Mishrilal was

residing separately from the rest of the family and was cultivating the land and after

his death, defendants No.5, 6 and 7 are the owners and in possession of the land given

to Mishrilal. It was further pleaded that Mishrilal or his legal representatives have no

right or title in the remaining land of Bhavani. Out of the land, 1.254 hectares of land

situated in Village Baroda and 1.966 hectares of land situated in Village Pali, Tahsil

Shamshabad, District Vidisha was kept by Bhavani for his own livelihood as well as

for his wife and was cultivating the said land. The remaining land is in possession of

the defendants No.1 to 5 as per their shares and are earning the livelihood. On
                                            3

12/06/1982, Bhavani executed a ''Will'' in favour of the plaintiff in respect of 3.220

hectares of land, which he had kept for his livelihood and the defendants No.1 to 5

were made owners of the remaining land. In the year 1986, Bhavani died and his last

rites were performed by the appellant. Imrati Bai was already given dowry as well as

cash at the time of her marriage, therefore, she does not have any share in the

property. It was further pleaded that the defendants No.6 to 13 have no right or title in

the land in dispute. It was further pleaded that the appellant is in possession of 7.030

hectares of land (including land bequeathed by Bhavani) out of 23.483 hectares of

land and is earning the livelihood. It was further pleaded that contrary to the ''Will'',

the defendants No.1 to 13 have got their names mutated in the revenue records, which

is void against the plaintiff and now, defendants No.6 to 13 are threatening to

mortgage the land. Therefore, the suit was filed for declaration of title and permanent

injunction as well as for declaration that the plaintiff is the owner and in possession of

1.</pre><p id="p_1">966 hectares of land forming part of survey no.335/1, situated in Village Pali, Tahsil

Shamshabad, District Vidisha as well as he is the owner and in possession of 5.064

hectares of land forming part of survey no.118 area 16.628 hectares and survey

no.129 area 6.855 hectares situated in village Baroda, Tahsil Shamshabad, District

Vidisha and thus, it was prayed that the plaintiff is the owner of 7.030 hectares of land

situated in both the villages. Accordingly,      decree of permanent injunction was

prayed.
</p>
<p id="p_2">      The defendants No.1 to 4 filed their written statement and admitted the plaint

averments.
</p>
<p id="p_3">      The defendants No.6,7, 8 and 9 also filed their separate written statements and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                                4</span>

pleaded that Mishrilal was granted ''patta'' in respect of 1.254 hectares of land and he

had not got any land in partition. It was also denied that the plaintiff is in possession

of survey no.335/1, area 1.966 hectares of land situated in Village Pali, and area 1.254

hectares of land situated in village Baroda, Tahsil Shamshabad, District Vidisha. It

was further pleaded that the ''Will'' is a forged and created document and no such

''Will'' was executed. Accordingly, it was prayed that the suit be dismissed.

</p><p id="p_4">      The defendant No.14 also filed separate written statement and pleaded that the

defendant No.14 is the co-sharer in the property in dispute and by registered sale deed

dated 13/07/2006, he has purchased the share of Sukku, Narayan, Balmukund,

Jawahar and Gopal and his name has also been mutated in the revenue record on the

basis of sale deed.
</p>
<p id="p_5">      The remaining defendants did not file their written statement.

      The Trial Court by order dated 16/09/2015 framed the following issues:-

        The Trial Court by judgment and decree dated 10 th March, 2016 dismissed the

suit.
</p>
<p id="p_8">        Being aggrieved by the judgment and decree passed by the Trial Court, the

appellant filed a regular civil appeal, which too has suffered dismissal by judgment

and decree dated 07th August, 2018.

has proposed the following substantial questions of law:-

              by the plaintiff and defendants, the learned courts below have

              Successions Act and <a href="/doc/63662/" id="a_2">Section 68</a> of Indian Evidence Act, in the

              light of the evidence given by the attesting witness to the Will?

             wrong assumptions, are not sustainable ?</blockquote><p id="p_10">

</p><p id="p_11">      It is submitted by the Counsel for the appellant that the Courts below failed to

see that the partition had taken place during the lifetime of Bhavani, and 6 bigha of

land was given to Mishrilal. Bhavani had separated Mishrilal from his family and

from thereafter, Mishrilal was residing separately and was cultivating the said land. It

is further submitted that the ''Will'' executed by Bhavani was duly proved by the

appellant and the findings recorded by the Courts below with regard to physical

possession are self-contradictory and destructive. The Appellate Court also erred in

dismissing the appeal without properly deciding the application under Order 41 Rule

27 of CPC.

      From the plain reading of ''Will'' Ex.P1, it is clear that it is a deed of partition.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_15">In this document, it is specifically mentioned that at present, he is the owner and in

possession of 112 bigha of land situated in Village Baroda and 9.5 bigha of land

situated in Village Pali. It is further mentioned that he and his wife are residing

separately from their children and 9.5 bigha of land situated in Village Pali and 6

bigha of land situated in village Baroda, is with him from which he would earn his

livelihood and the remaining land is being cultivated by his sons Sukku, Narayan,

Balmukund, Gopal and Jawahar as per their shares and since the Testator is not

keeping well, therefore, the appellant Balmukund would get additional land of 9.5

bigha situated in Village Pali and 6 bigha land situated in Village Baroda after his

death and the remaining land would go in equal share to his six children, Sukku,

Narayan, Balmukund, Gopal and Jawahar and Ramkunwar Bai after his death. Since

he has already given dowry at the time of marriage of Imrati Bai, therefore, she does

not have any share in the property and the last rites of Bhavani and his wife would be

performed by appellant Balmukund. From the plain reading of the ''Will'' Ex.P1, it

appears that at least on 12/06/1982 no partition had taken place. Although the

document dated 12/06/1982 Ex.P1 is titled as ''Will'' but the contents that his sons

would cultivate as per their shares, would certainly give this document a colour of

partition and thus, it is clear that it is a composite document in the nature of deed of

partition as well as ''Will'' in respect of the land kept by the Testator for his personal

livelihood, and thus it is mandatorily registerable.

</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_9">             ''4. So far as the motive is concerned, in our view the
             prosecution has absolutely failed to prove the same. The
             prosecution case that there was a previous partition has been
             attempted to be proved by the document dated 2-4-1996,
             Exhibit P-46, wherein there is a recital that partition had already
             been effected by deed dated 31-3-1975, which has not been
             brought on record. It is not known whether the 1975 deed was a
             deed of partition or a memorandum of partition. In case
             partition was effected thereby, we do not know whether the
             same was registered or unregistered. If it was unregistered, the
             same could not be taken into consideration to prove partition
             between the parties as it was inadmissible in evidence. It was
             pointed out that Exhibit P-46 further shows that apart from the
             partition effected by deed dated 31-3-1975, parties partitioned
             their properties at least by the deed dated 2-4-1996, Exhibit P-</blockquote><p id="p_17">
</p><p id="p_18">             46. Learned counsel very fairly could not contend that the said
             deed was a memorandum of partition. This document being not
             a registered one was inadmissible in evidence and, therefore, it
             cannot be of any avail to the prosecution to prove partition
             amongst the two brothers. As the prosecution failed to prove the
             case of previous partition, the motive that in the previous
             partition shares were not properly allocated resulting in
             commission of the present crime, has not been proved by the
             prosecution.''

      The Supreme Court in the case of <a href="/doc/59829381/" id="a_4">Sita Ram Bhama vs. Ramvatar Bhama</a>

reported in (2018) 15 SCC 130 has held as under:-

''10. The only question which needs to be considered in the
present case is as to whether document dated 9-9-1994 could
have been accepted by the trial court in evidence or the trial
court has rightly held the said document inadmissible. The
plaintiff claimed the document dated 9-9-1994 as memorandum
of family settlement. The plaintiff's case is that earlier partition
took place in the lifetime of the father of the parties on 25-10-
1992 which was recorded as memorandum of family settlement
on 9-9-1994. There are more than one reasons due to which we
are of the view that the document dated 9-9-1994 was not mere
memorandum of family settlement, rather a family settlement
itself. Firstly, on 25-10-1992, the father of the parties was
himself owner of both, the residence and shop being self-
acquired properties of Devi Dutt Verma. The High Court has
rightly held that the said document cannot be said to be a will,
so that the father could have made the will in favour of his two
sons, the plaintiff and the defendant. Neither the plaintiff nor
the defendant had any share in the property on the day when it
is said to have been partitioned by Devi Dutt Verma. Devi Dutt
Verma died on 10-9-1993. After his death, the plaintiff, the
defendant and their mother as well as sisters become the legal
heirs under the <a href="/doc/685111/" id="a_5">Hindu Succession Act</a>, 1956 inheriting the
property being a Class I heir. The document dated 9-9-1994
divided the entire property between the plaintiff and the
defendant which document is also claimed to be signed by their
mother as well as the sisters. In any view of the matter, there is
relinquishment of the rights of other heirs of the properties,
hence, the courts below are right in their conclusion that there
being relinquishment, the document dated 9-9-1994 was
compulsorily registrable under <a href="/doc/561156/" id="a_6">Section 17</a> of the Registration
Act.
</p><p id="p_20">11. Pertaining to family settlement, a memorandum of family
settlement and its necessity of registration, the law has been
settled by this Court. It is sufficient to refer to the judgment of
this Court in Kale v. Director of Consolidation (1976) 3 SCC
</p><p id="p_21">119. The propositions with regard to family settlement, its
registration were laid down by this Court in paras 10 and 11:
(SCC pp. 126-27)
     "10. In other words to put the binding effect and the
 essentials of a family settlement in a concretised form, the
 matter may be reduced into the form of the following
 propositions:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_10">         (1) The family settlement must be a bona fide one so as
      to resolve family disputes and rival claims by a fair and
      equitable division or allotment of properties between the
      various members of the family;
</blockquote><span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                           10</span>

<blockquote id="blockquote_11">                      (2) The said settlement must be voluntary and should not
                  be induced by fraud, coercion or undue influence;
                      (3) The family arrangement may be even oral in which
                  case no registration is necessary;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_12">                      (4) It is well settled that registration would be necessary
                  only if the terms of the family arrangement are reduced into
                  writing. Here also, a distinction should be made between a
                  document containing the terms and recitals of a family
                  arrangement made under the document and a mere
                  memorandum prepared after the family arrangement had
                  already been made either for the purpose of the record or for
                  information of the court for making necessary mutation. In
                  such a case the memorandum itself does not create or
                  extinguish any rights in immovable properties and therefore
                  does not fall within the mischief of <a href="/doc/561156/" id="a_7">Section 17(2)</a> of the
                  Registration Act and is, therefore, not compulsorily
                  registrable;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_13">                      (5) The members who may be parties to the family
                  arrangement must have some antecedent title, claim or
                  interest even a possible claim in the property which is
                  acknowledged by the parties to the settlement. Even if one
                  of the parties to the settlement has no title but under the
                  arrangement the other party relinquishes all its claims or
                  titles in favour of such a person and acknowledges him to be
                  the sole owner, then the antecedent title must be assumed
                  and the family arrangement will be upheld and the courts
                  will find no difficulty in giving assent to the same;
                      (6) Even if bona fide disputes, present or possible, which
                  may not involve legal claims are settled by a bona fide
                  family arrangement which is fair and equitable the family
                  arrangement is final and binding on the parties to the
                  settlement.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_14">             11. The principles indicated above have been clearly enunciated
             and adroitly adumbrated in a long course of decisions of this
             Court as also those of the Privy Council and other High Courts,
             which we shall discuss presently."

        may be effected orally but if the parties reduce it in writing to a formal
        document which is intended to be evidence of partition, it. would have
        the effect of declaring the exclusive title of the coparcener to whom a
        particular property was allotted in partition and thus the document

            exclusive title of the coparcener to whom a particular property was

<blockquote id="blockquote_18">      Accordingly, this Court is of the considered opinion that since the ''Will'' dated

12/06/1982 (Ex.P1) was, in fact a partition deed of Property as well as ''Will'' in

respect of the land kept by the Testator for his livelihood, therefore, its registration is

required because it is not an acknowledgment of partition or settlement but in fact, a

partition deed. In absence of registration of document Ex.P1 dated 12/06/1982 which

is titled as ''Will'', this Court is of the considered opinion that the document dated

12/06/1982 Ex.P1 is not admissible. It is the case of the appellant that the partition

had already taken place prior to 1982.However, from the document dated 12/06/1982

Ex.P1,it is clear that no partition had taken place prior to execution of said document
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                           12</span>

and the appellant has also failed to prove that any partition took place after 1982.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_22">Thus, this Court is of the considered opinion that as the partition had not taken place

between the legal representatives of Bhavani, therefore, the possession of one co-

sharer cannot be treated as hostile to other co-sharer.

</p><p id="p_23">      So far as the findings given by the Courts below with regard to the failure of

the appellant to prove the ''Will'' dated 12/06/1982 Ex.P1 is concerned, this Court has

already come to a conclusion that in fact, the said document is a composite document

of partition and ''Will'' and thus, it required registration. Furthermore, the Appellate

Court has given a finding of fact that at the time of execution of ''Will'' dated

12/06/1982, Ex.P1 the age of Bhavani was between 80-90 years, therefore, the onus

was on the propounder of ''Will'' to prove that the Testator was in fit state of mind.

However, no such statement has been made by the attesting witnesses, Ramprasad

(PW2) and Balmukund (PW1). Further, the Testator had affixed his thumb impression

on the so-called ''Will'' dated 12/06/1982 Ex.P1. However, it has not been proved by

the appellant that the ''Will'' was ever read to the Testator and it was understood by

him. Both the Courts below have given concurrent findings of fact that the appellant

has failed to remove all the suspicious circumstances which are attached to a ''Will''.

This being the concurrent findings of fact, cannot be interfered with by this Court

until and unless the same are pointed out to be perverse. No perversity could be

pointed out by the Counsel for the appellant.

<p id="p_24">      Accordingly, this Court is of the considered opinion that no substantial question

of law arises in the present case.
