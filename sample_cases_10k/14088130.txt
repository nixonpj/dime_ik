 IN THE HIGH COURT OF JUDICATURE FOR 
RAJASTHAN
BENCH AT JAIPUR.

O R D E R

S.B. CIVIL WRIT PETITION NO.12620/2010.

Anshu Gupta 
Vs. 
Rajasthan Technical University Kota &amp; Anr. 

Date of Order:-                    January 3, 2011. 

HON'BLE MR.JUSTICE MOHAMMAD RAFIQ

Shri Mahendra Goyal for the petitioner.
Shri A.K. Bhargava for the University-respondent No.1. 
*******
BY THE COURT:-</pre>
<p id="p_1">1)		The matter has come up on an application filed by the respondents for recalling the order dated 3/12/2010 but since the arguments that are advanced by both the parties are considered sufficient, the writ petition itself is being heard and decided finally. 
</p><p id="p_2">2)		Shri Mahendra Goyal, learned counsel for the petitioner has argued that petitioner has secured 54% marks in the LLB examination, mark sheet of which, she produced before the respondents at the time of her admission in MBA Examination but when she was due to appear in the 3rd Semester of MBA Course, she was not allowed to appear therein on the objection being raised by the respondent-University that she got less than 50% marks in B.A. Examination therefore she could not be considered eligible to appear in the 3rd Semester of MBA Examination. Learned counsel for the petitioner has argued that even at the first place, when petitioner took admission in the 1st semester of MBA Examination, her eligibility was scrutinized by the respondent-University, which granted enrollment to the petitioner. It is only when petitioner was due to appear in the 3rd Semester, her eligibility was questioned. Learned counsel argued that respondent-University is not treating the degree of LLB as graduation degree and on that basis is not considering the petitioner eligible whereas, petitioner has secured 54% marks in the LLB., which degree is also a graduation degree. In this regard, petitioner submitted a representation to the Vice Chancellor and the Controller of Examination on 30/7/2010 by clearly pointing out this fact but same was not taken into consideration. 
</p><p id="p_3">3)		Per contra, Shri A.K. Bhargava, learned counsel appearing for respondent-University has argued that degree of B.A. is a graduation degree whereas, degree of LLB. is not a graduation degree rather, degree is a postal degree which is awarded after passing the graduation. Minimum eligibility to appear in the LLB Examination is 50% in B.A. Examination but that is not the requisite eligibility for admission in MBA Course. That apart, petitioner has not produced mark-sheets of three years LLB Course whereas, he has submitted final year mark-sheet of LLB Examination. Therefore, it cannot be accepted that petitioner has secured 54% in aggregate in all the three years examinations of LLB. Only provisional enrollment was granted to the petitioner by the University and that too for availing the facility of University library. 
</p><p id="p_4">4)		After hearing learned counsel for the parties and perusing the material available on record, I find that assumption of the respondent University that marks of BA Examination would form basis for adjudging eligibility of the petitioner for admission in MBA Examination is misplaced. Factually, respondents granted enrollment and admission to the petitioner in 1st &amp; 2nd Semesters of MBA Course. Firstly, this issue ought to have been examined and raised by the respondents in the first instance and secondly, the degree of LLB itself a graduation degree. The submission made in para 4 of the reply that LLB degree is a postal degree which is awarded after passing the graduation and hence it cannot be treated as a graduation degree, cannot be accepted. Such a narrow construction made by the respondents cannot be allowed. Petitioner had already appeared in 1st and 2nd semesters of MBA examinations and at that time, respondents did not object it. Approach of the University in unnecessarily forcing the students to approach this Court on such a flimsy objection, cannot be appreciated. The argument of the respondent University that petitioner was awarded only provisional enrollment and that too for library purposes, cannot be accepted. If that be so, without enrollment, petitioner could not have been allowed to appear even in 1st and 2nd semesters of MBA examinations. 
</p><p id="p_5">5)		In the result, writ petition is allowed. Petitioner is directed to supply mark-sheets of all the three years of LLB Examination to the respondents, if not already submitted so as to examine the veracity of assertion made by the petitioner in his representation dated 30/7/2010 submitted to the Vice Chancellor of the University that he has secured 50% marks in aggregate in the BA examinations. Respondents are directed to treat the petitioner eligible to appear in the 3rd semester of MBA Examination and declare the due results in accordance with law within ten days from the date of submission of copy of this order before the respondents. In the eventuality if petitioner fail in any one of the subjects of 1st and 2nd semesters examinations of MBA, respondents are directed to permit petitioner to appear in those back papers as per their rules.
