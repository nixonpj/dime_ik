</pre>
<p id="p_1">J.Chelameswar, C.J.
</p>
<p id="p_2">     The Writ Petition is filed with the prayer as follows:

</p><p id="p_3">                      "i. Call for the records relating to Exhibit.P6

        peruse and quash the same by issuance of a writ of

        certiorari and or any other appropriate writ, order or

        direction.
</p>
<p id="p_4">                      ii. issue a writ of mandamus or any other writ

        of direction, directing to the 2nd respondent to launch

        prosecution against the 5th respondent and its Directors

        under section 24 of Act 28 of 2008.
</p>
<p id="p_5">                      iii. issue a writ of mandamus or any other writ

        of direction, directing the 2nd respondent to seize the

        vehicles and machinery being used for reclamation of plots

        covered by Ext.P1 and order restoration of the land to

        original position under Section 13 of Act 28 of 2008.

</p><p id="p_6">                      iv. issue a writ of mandamus or any other writ

        of direction, directing respondents 1 to 3 to curb the illegal

        activities going on in the land covered by Exhibit P1 and P2.

</p><p id="p_7">                      v.    Issue such other writ, order or direction

        which this Honourable Court deems fit in the nature and

        circumstances of the case."
</p>
<p id="p_8">          2.     The petition is purported to have been filed in

public interest by a registered Society registered under the

Travancore-Cochin Literary,         Scientific and Charitable Societies

W.P(C) No. 29025 of 2008
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                    -:2:-</span>

<a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_1">Registration Act</a>, 1955. The dispute in the petition is regarding

the activity of the 5th respondent in proposing to construct a

resort. It is averred in the writ petition that the 5th respondent

purchased 40 plots admeasuring 13.1983 Acres on the bank of

the Vembanad backwaters.            It appears that the property is

situated on the eastern side of the Alappuzha Thannermukkam

Road.
</p>
<p id="p_9">           3. It appears that the 5th respondent, after purchasing

the abovementioned property, made an application before the 4th

respondent,i.e. the Mannanchery Grama Panchyat for approving

the layout of the property for construction of the resorts and

eventually secured a building permit which is marked as Ext.P6 in

the instant writ petition. The relevant portion of the pleading in

the writ petition is as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">                   "4) After the purchase of the property, the 5th

       respondent made application before the 4th respondent for

       approval of lay out of the plot for construction of resorts. A

       true copy of the application with accompanying documents is

       produced herewith and marked as Exhibit.P4. The Panchayat

       committee,in turn, referred the application to the District Town

       Planning Officer, Alappuzha for its approval. The Chief Town

       Planning Officer, Trivandrum by his order dated 23.06.2008

       gave approval for the layout, subject to conditions.      A true

W.P(C) No. 29025 of 2008
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                  -:3:-</span>

       copy of the order No.C-3/4725/08 DDS dated 23.06.2008 is

       produced herewith and marked as Exhibit.P5. Pursuant to the

       approval of the layout, the 4th respondent issued building

       permit. True copy of the building permit is produced herewith

       and marked as Exhibit.P6."
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">           4. Ext.P6 is the impugned order in the writ petition

(the building permit granted in favour of the 5th respondent). The

document purports to be a building permit issued under Rule 11

of the Kerala Municipality Building Rules, 1999 which are

admitted by the respondent to be applicable to the area within

the jurisdiction of the 4th respondent. The petitioners attack the

abovementioned Ext.P6 on two counts, i.e.,(1) the permission

accorded under Ext.P6 is in contravention of the Coastal Zone

Regulations and (2) that the activity of the 5th respondent to

make constructions in the disputed area is contrary to Section 11

of the Kerala Conservation of Paddy Land &amp; Wetland Act, 2008.</blockquote><p id="p_10">

</p><p id="p_11">           5.    We are of the opinion that for the purpose of

deciding the writ petition it is not necessary for us to examine

whether the impugned order, Ext.P6, is violative of the

abovementioned two laws.         We are of the opinion that the

impugned order is required to be set aside on the ground that the

order does not disclose any application of mind even with

W.P(C) No. 29025 of 2008
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                     -:4:-</span>

reference to the powers under Rule 11 of the Kerala Municipality

Building Rules, 1999. Rule 11 reads as follows:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">              "11. Approval of site and plans and issue of

       permit.- (1) The Secretary shall, after inspection of the site

       and verification of the site plan and documents, if convinced

       of the bonafides of the ownership of the site, and that the site

       plan, drawings and specifications conforms to the site and the

       provisions of these rules or bye laws made under the Act and

       any other law, approve the site and site plan.

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">              (2) The Secretary shall, after approving the site and

       site plan verify whether the building plan, elevation and

       sections of the building and specifications of the work

       conforms to the site and site plan, and is in accordance with

       these rules and bye laws made under the Act or any other

       law, approve the plan and issue permit to execute the work.

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">              (3) Approval of site and plans shall be intimated to the

       applicant in writing and the permit as in Appendix C shall be

       issued on remittance of the permit fee at the rates specified

       in Schedule II and submission of revised or modified plans, if

       approved with modifications or conditions.

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_6">              (4) If after inspection of the site and verification of the

       plans and documents, Secretary decides to refuse approval,

       the same shall be communicated in writing specifying the

       reasons.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_7">              (5) Secretary shall, if modification to any plan, drawing

       or specification is required or any further document or plan or

       information is required or fresh plan is required under these

       rules for taking a decision, intimate the same to the applicant

       in writing within ten days from the date of receipt of such

       application or plan or document or information."

</blockquote><p id="p_12">W.P(C) No. 29025 of 2008
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                     -:5:-</span>

</p><p id="p_13">            6. It can be seen from the Rule that two approvals are

contemplated under the two sub-rules of Rule 11. While sub-rule

(1) contemplates approval of a site plan, sub-rule (2)

contemplates the approval of the building plan. Ext.P6 purports

to be a permission granted for a new construction, with reference

to an application dated 28.06.2008 made by the 5th respondent.

It does not appear from the reading of the said permission that

any examination of the various factors indicated under sub-rule

(2) i.e., building plan, elevation and sections of the building etc.

were ever examined before granting such permission, as there is

no reference to anyone of those factors in the said document.

The relevant portion of the document reads as follows:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_8">            "Ref:Application dated 28.6.08 from Sri./Smt.Tamara Real

</p><p id="p_20">             7. In the circumstances, we are of the opinion that

irrespective of the fact that whether granting of a permission for

construction activity in the disputed area tantamounts to

violation of Coastal Zone Regulation or the Kerala Conservation

of Paddy Land &amp; Wetland Act, 2008, the same, in our opinion, is

required to be set aside on the simple ground of non-application

of mind by the respondent. The same is accordingly set aside.
