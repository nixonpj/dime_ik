</pre><p id="p_1">                                  DATED : 20th DECEMBER, 2018

 ORAL JUDGMENT :-
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3"> 1.       This is an appeal filed by defendant no.2. He is challenging

 the judgment passed by learned District Judge-1, Beed in Regular

 Civil appeal No. 11 of 2007. The facts leading to this appeal are as

 follows:
</p>
<p id="p_4">

 a.       The original plaintiff Shaikh Pasha is the father of defendant

 no.1 Shaikh Taher and defendant no.2 Shaikh Shahed. As per the

 plaint pleadings, by registered sale deed dated 25.11.1980, he

 purchased land block no. 233 ad-measuring 3 H. 58 R. in the name

 of his son defendant no.1 Shaikh Taher, land block no. 21 by

 registered sale deed dated 12.02.1987 in the name of defendant

 no.2 Shaikh Shahed and land block no. 87 by registered sale deed

 dated 02.07.2001 in the name of defendant no.1. Though the lands

 were purchased in the name of defendant nos. 1 and 2, the real

 purchaser was the plaintiff and these transactions were benami

 transactions. The plaintiff was in cultivating possession of these

 lands. Defendant nos. 1 and 2 thereafter started residing

 separately.
</p>
<p id="p_5">

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">::: Uploaded on - 24/12/2018                 ::: Downloaded on - 25/12/2018 22:38:40 :::</span>
</p><p id="p_6">                                                                909-SA-378-15
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                   -3-</span>

 b.       On 27.03.2002, defendant no.1 sold land block no. 233 to

 defendant nos. 3 and 4 and therefore, on 05.09.2002, the plaintiff

 filed suit for declaration that he is owner of the suit properties and

 defendant nos. 1 and 2 are Benamidars and for perpetual injunction

 to restrain defendants from disturbing his possession. The suit is

 not valued as per the sale price shown in the sale deed but on a

 fixed valuation of Rs.200/- by assessing the suit as per the land

 revenue. Defendant no.1 contested the suit. He denied that the suit

 properties were purchased by his father. He claimed that he and his

 brother were the owners of the suit properties purchased in their

 respective names. Defendant nos. 3 and 4 also filed written

 statements.
</p>
<p id="p_7">

 c.       This appeal is not dealing with the lands block nos. 233 and

 87 which were purchased in the name of defendant no.1. The

 appeal is filed by defendant no.2 in whose name land block no.21

 was purchased. He did not appear in the trial court. Learned trial

 judge framed issues. Issue no.2 was relating to proof of ownership

 of plaintiff with regard to land block no.21 purchased in the name

 of defendant no.2. There was also an issue regarding bar of the

 provisions of <a href="/doc/57071259/" id="a_1">The Prohibition of Benami Property Transactions Act</a>,

 1988 (for short, "the Act of 1988").
</p>
<p id="p_8">

</p><p id="p_9">                                                                 909-SA-378-15
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                    -4-</span>

 d        The trial judge held that the bar of provisions of the Act of

 1988 was applicable only in respect of land block no.87. He

 observed that there was thick and fiduciary relationship between

 the plaintiff and defendant nos. 1 and 2 and therefore, the bar was

 not attracted in respect of other lands. The findings in this regard

 are not specific. However, strangely he observed that defendant

 nos. 1 and 2 were the owners of the respective lands and therefore

 the plaintiff was not entitled for perpetual injunction. Hence he

 dismissed the suit.
</p>
<p id="p_10">

 e        The plaintiff filed Regular Civil Appeal No.11 of 2007. Again

 defendant no.2 appeared through one Advocate. According to

 defendant no.2, his father made some representation to him and

 his father had provided an Advocate for him who made wrong

 submissions before the Judge. The first appellate court held that

 land block no.21 was standing in the name of defendant no.2 as

 benami and plaintiff was the real owner and was in exclusive

 possession and therefore, he partly allowed the appeal in respect of

 land block no.21. He granted declaration of the plaintiff's

 ownership and also granted perpetual injunction against defendant

 no.2 in respect of land block no.21. The appeal was dismissed with

 regard to other two properties of defendant no.1.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                           -5-</span>

 f.       It may be pertinent to note here that land block no.233 was

 purchased in 1980 when defendant no.1 was aged 15 to 16 years

 and it is held not benami whereas land block no.21 was purchased

 in the name of defendant no.2 in 1987 when he was aged around

 21 years and it is held to be benami.
</p>
<p id="p_12">

</p><p id="p_13"> 2.       Being aggrieved, defendant no.2 has preferred this appeal.

 Learned Advocate Mrs. Ansari pointed out that the learned trial

 judge has not considered the provisions of the Act of 1988 nor

 there was proper pleading and evidence to show that land block

 no. 21 was actually purchased by the plaintiff from his own funds.

 The entire judgment shows only the following discussion with

 regard to land block no.21.
</p>
<p id="p_14">

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">          "22. So far as Gut No.21 is concerned, I am of the
          opinion that there is no written statement of defendant
          No.2. Moreover, his advocate has submitted at bar and
          supported the plaint allegations.          In my opinion, his
          submission is worthy acceptable against defendant No.2
          only      and        not   regarding   whole    suit.     In     such
          circumstances to that extent this appeal is required to
          be allowed. In the result, I answer the points
          accordingly and pass the following order."

          (2)     In the affirmative.


</pre><blockquote id="blockquote_7"> 4.       On plain reading of the plaint, the plaintiff is claiming to be

 the real owner and defendant no.2 is shown as Benamidar. Though

 the transaction has taken place before the introduction of the Act of

 1988, from the date of applicability of the Act not only there is

 prohibition to enter into benami transactions, but even the right to

 claim any relief by way of suit or right to raise defence on the plea

 of benami are taken away. Section 4 of the Act of 1988 reads as

 pleading or evidence to show that defendant nos. 1 and 2 were

 trustees or persons standing in fiduciary capacity to the plaintiff

 and the property was held for the benefit of the plaintiff for whom

 they were trustees. Apart from the fact that there are no specific

 pleadings, the evidence also does not indicate that the plaintiff had

 paid money to them for purchasing property in his own name, but

 they have purchased the property in their own names. There is not

 even remote material to suggest that defendant no.2 was a trustee

 for the plaintiff in respect of purchase of property block no. 21. I

 rely on the decision in the case of <a href="/doc/98297320/" id="a_4">R. Rajagopal Reddy and Ors. vs

 Padmini Chandrasekharan</a>, reported in (1995) 2 SCC 630 to

 registered sale deed in his name and the plaintiff was bound to

 lead cogent material to establish that the actual consideration was

 passed from him to the purchaser. In this regard, I find that the

 plaintiff has not produced the original sale deed. If he was the real

 owner, the sale deed would have been in his possession. The

 plaintiff has not examined the purchaser or the attesting witness to

 the sale deed. He has not produced any documentary evidence to

 show that he had advanced the consideration amount to the

 purchaser. In the evidence, he was cross-examined by defendant

 no.1 with regard to the transactions of defendant no.1. His

 evidence shows that he was claiming that he was having a grocery

 shop, a matador, two crane machines and income from 10 acres of

 ancestral agricultural land but in cross-examination he admitted

 that he was not in a position to produce licence for the grocery

 shop. He has no documents that he was holding a matador or crane

 as claimed by him. There are no pleadings also to that effect. When

 the registered sale deed is in the name of defendant no.2, even in

 absence of written statement, the court could not have accepted the

 bare words of plaintiff as a gospel truth.

</p><p id="p_24"> 9.       The appreciation of evidence by both the courts is poor. The

 trial court has held that the provisions of the Act of 1988 are

 applicable in respect of the lands of defendant no.1 but not to the

 lands purchased in the name of defendant no.2. At the same time,

 he says that defendant no.2 is the owner of block no.21. The

 findings are self-contradictory. But ultimately, he has dismissed the

 suit and defendant no.2 had no right to challenge the same. In the

 appeal, strangely the learned judge of the lower appellate court did

 not consider the pleadings and the evidence on record, rather, the

 dearth of pleading and dearth of evidence on record. He has also

 not considered why the trial judge has not granted the relief to the

 plaintiff in respect of land block no.21 purchased in the name of

 defendant no.2. He simply relied on the fact that there was no

 written statement by defendant no.2 and that Advocate for

 defendant no.2 made some concessions. It is well settled that court

 cannot rely on any concessions or admissions given by the

 defendant without express authority given by the party. I find that

 the first appellate court has totally neglected to consider the

 statutory bar under the Act of 1988. The material pleadings and

 evidence and the absence thereof has been also overlooked. The

 findings recorded by the first appellate court in this regard are

 perverse and based on no material. Hence those cannot be

 sustained. Hence, question no.2 is answered accordingly in the

 affirmative.

 the first appellate court in Regular Civil Appeal No. 11 of 2007 is

 set aside. The suit is dismissed with regard to the land block no. 21

 as well. There shall be no order as to costs.
