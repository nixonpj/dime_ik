                Mr. Md. Kutub Uddin
                                 ...for the State



                The accused/petitioner has filed this application under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_4">Section

             439</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure seeking release on bail in

             connection with the Durgachak Police Station Case No. 773 of

             2019 dated 20.06.2019 alleging commission of offence punishable

             under <a href="/doc/330464/" id="a_5">Section 20(b)(ii)(c)</a> of the Narcotic Drugs &amp; <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_6">Psychotropic

             Substances Act</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_4">                It is submitted by the learned advocate for the petitioner that

             petitioner has been falsely targeted to the trapped in the instant

             case    in   consequence    of   a   deep   rooted   conspiracy   and    a

             preconceived plan simply to malign the petitioner, who is not only
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                           2</span>
a practicing advocate being a member of Bar Association, but also

having political attachment. Disputing with the discrepancies in

the seizure together with the exercise of process relating to the

arrest and forwarding of the accused to the court in consequence

of arrest, shown in the forwarding memo, learned advocate for the

petitioner frankly submits that this is nothing but a false case,

which has been sufficiently demonstrated not only in the seizure

memo, but also in the forwarding report, submitted by police.

    Learned Additional Public Prosecutor raises objection against

the prayer for bail submitting that there has been recovery of as

many as 24 kilograms of loose ganja         from the possession of

accused, who was carrying the same in his own vehicle after

having driven the vehicle for his desired destination.

    Admittedly, the accused is in custody for the last 77 days. The

seized contraband item has already been sent for chemical

examination and report. In the meantime police has already

recovered the particulars of the vehicle seized, and the driving

license of the accused. The documents pertaining to vehicle go to

show that it was registered in the name of the accused/petitioner.

   Reliance was placed by learned Additional Public Porsecutor on

three decisions reported in (2007) 3 SCC (Criminal) 506, 2015 SAR

(Criminal) 597 (SC) and (2010) 9 SCC 608 in order to establish

that for huge quantity of Ganja being recovered from the conscious

possession of accused, the bar engrafted in <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_7">Section 97</a> of the NDPS
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                            3</span>
Act will come into operation and the presumption of innocence as

sought to be established referring the discrepancies with the

process involving arrest and seizure cannot be established without

entering into the trial.
</p>
<p id="p_5">     According to defence, the plea of innocence could be raised at

any point of time, even without entering into the trial, in order to

discharge reverse burden of proof.
</p>
<p id="p_6">    Upon consideration of the material, already collected in the CD

transpiring direct involvement of the accused/petitioner with the

huge recovery of contraband item being beyond the commercial

quantity, and bearing in mind the conspicuous bar contained in

<a href="/doc/496325/" id="a_8">Section 37</a> of the NDPS Act, we are not inclined to grant bail to the

petitioner at this stage. The prayer for bail, as such, stands

refused. The relevant point of discrepancy, if any, pertaining to the

process involved in seizure, arrest and forwarding the accused,

thereafter, to the court, as raised by the defence, may be

considered under the provision of the law at the time of conducting

the trial.
</p>
<p id="p_7">
    A certified copy of this order be immediately made available to

the petitioner subject to compliance of all requisite formalities.
