rendering two years of service to respondent No. 4 leaving behind his wife

and three children i.e. one son and two daughters. The petitioner approached

the Bank to give employment to one of the dependent of the deceased

employee in May, 2003 vide representation P2. However, no appointment

was granted to the dependent of the deceased employee inspite of

completing all the formalities as required by the respondent-Bank.

Accordingly, the petitioner was forced to file Civil Writ Petition No. 5755

of 2005. This Court vide order dated 28.05.2008 disposed off the aforesaid

Kumar son of the petitioner for compassionate appointment under the

scheme which was in vogue in the year 2003. The respondents, however,

rejected the claim of the petitioner vide order dated 26.09.2008 which is

impugned in the amended writ petition as Annexure P7, on the very same

grounds which were rather not accepted by the High Court in its order dated

28.05.2008 (P6). Thereafter, on 17.12.2010, this High Court passed the

following order:-

              the Court. He states that the earlier incumbent has retired and
              he has taken over the charge only on 01.09.2010. He further
              submits that given some reasonable time, the entire matter
              shall be reconsidered and if feasible, within the prescribed

petitioner on the ground that the family was not without sufficient means of

livelihood and the financial condition of the family of the deceased

employee was not such that the family was not able to meet the crisis by

taking into consideration the financial conditions of the deceased family

AIJEL SC 32465 and Local Administration Department and another

v. M. Selvanayagam @ Kumaravelu 2011 AIR (SC) 1880.

</p><p id="p_6">            Learned counsel for the parties were heard at length.

            The petitioner had earlier filed Civil Writ Petition No.5755 of

2005 which was disposed of with direction to the respondents to decide the

claim of the petitioner's son, namely, Sunil Kumar on compassionate ground

under the scheme which was in vogue on 17.05.2003 with the following

observations:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_9">                   "The respondents have tried to explain the grounds
                   for giving preference for appointment to respondent
                   No. 3 over and above the claim of the petitioner's
                   son. While disclosing the income, it is stated that
                   the retiral benefits obtained by deceased Bishan
                   Dass's family were Rs.3,06,721/-, whereas retiral
                   benefits received by the dependants of deceased
                   Ashok Kumar were to the tune of Rs.2,80,215/-. In
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3"> CWP No. 20348 of 2008 (O&amp;M)                                                   4</span>


                  addition to that dependants of deceased Bishan Dass
                  were also paid a sum of Rs.52,000/- by the LIC
                  under its policy and the family pension of Rs.2000/-
                  per month is also being received by them.             The
                  respondents have also indicated the details of the
                  liabilities     of   above   named      two   employees.
                  However, nothing has been mentioned about the
                  family strength of both the deceased employees.
                  Admittedly, the petitioner has two sons and one
                  daughter and family details of deceased Ashok
                  Kumar has not been given retiral benefits cannot
                  provide sufficient regular source of income. There
                  has to be a regular running income to sustain the
                  family.       No rule has been brought to my notice
                  which provides the extent of any financial income
                  for grant or refusal of the employment on
                  compassionate ground. Under these circumstances,
                  the plea raised by the respondents cannot be
                  accepted.       In any case, respondents are yet to
                  consider       the   claim   of   the    petitioner   for
                  compassionate employment for his son."</blockquote><p id="p_7">

</p><p id="p_8">             This Court finds that the very observations have been ignored

by the authorities while once again rejecting the claim of the petitioner and

on those very grounds which were not accepted by the High Court while

passing the above order dated 28.05.2008 in CWP No. 5755 of 2005.

</p><p id="p_9">            The observations have been totally ignored as is evident from

the impugned order. Admittedly, even as per the Policy 2003, employment

of other family members, size of the family and liabilities, if any, have to be

taken into account. However, in the present case, the same have not been

taken into account. While considering the financial status of the petitioner,

it has not been disclosed and has neither been disputed that so called house
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4"> CWP No. 20348 of 2008 (O&amp;M)                                              5</span>


is 7½ marlas was owned by the father of the deceased employee who has

two sons, namely, Kuldip Kumar and Ram Krishan Kumar and its market

value has been assessed at Rs.1,50,000/- and the petitioner is entitled only

to 1/3rd of her share. The rest is not regular source of income. The deceased

has left behind his wife and three children. It is not disputed that a Performa

of application for employment in Bank on compassionate            ground was

handed to the petitioner for filling up. As per the said Performa, none of the

children of the deceased employee was engaged in any business or

employment any where. They were not having any other source of income.

</p><p id="p_10">               There is no dispute with the law settled by the Hon'ble Supreme

Court in case Umesh Kumar Nagpal (supra) that the compassionate

appointment is to provide help to family of deceased employee to tide over

sudden financial crisis and not to provide employment. However, the

Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Umesh Kumar Nagpal (supra) set

aside the order of      the High Court as the High Court had ordered the

compassionate appointment in posts equivalent to the posts held by the

deceased employees and above class III and IV. Whereas, in the present

case, the husband of the petitioner died in 2003. The application was also

moved in the same year. The respondent delayed the appointment and now

they cannot be allowed to take advantage of their own wrong. Moreover,

there was specific direction by this Court in CWP No. 5755 of 2005 to

consider the case of the petitioner's son in terms of the observations made

therein. As noticed above, the respondent-Bank totally ignored the same and

passed the impugned order arbitrarily and in complete violation of the

observation.
</p>
<p id="p_11">               In the case of Local Administration Department and another
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5"> CWP No. 20348 of 2008 (O&amp;M)                                             6</span>


(supra), the application for appointment was made after 7 years and 6

months of the father's death. As such, the aforesaid judgements do not apply

in the facts of the present case.
</p>
<p id="p_12">             In view of above, it is evident that the respondents have

arbitrarily rejected the case of the petitioner. Accordingly, the present writ

petition is allowed and the respondent-Bank is directed to grant appointment

to the petitioner's son as per his entitlement in terms of the Policy 2003 on

the available vacant post or as and when a post is available.
