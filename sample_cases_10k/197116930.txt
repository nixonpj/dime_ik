<p id="p_5">                                   1.   The revision petition is against an order

            rejecting an application for production of documents by secondary

            evidence. Counsel points out to me that an agreement/ compromise

            deed dated 1.8.2013 was admitted in the course of cross-

            examination of the defendant and it is his statement that the original

            has been displaced in the office of his counsel.            The ground

            mentioned under Section 65 is duly complied with and there was no

            need to even to file a petition for reception of secondary evidence

            and a ground sought in evidence is sufficient to admit the documents

            as secondary evidence and the ground stated could be tested in the

            cross-examination.          This court has laid down a procedure for

            reception of secondary evidence and the superfluity of having to file a

            petition seeking for such permission in the decision of this Court

            rendered in Dr. S. P. Arora Vs. Satbir Singh 2010(5) RCR (Civil)

            that there are several affidavits along with the compromise which are

            sought to be introduced. Affidavits of living persons cannot be

            brought as proof of statement and unless the party himself is before

            court and the affidavit is a manner of setting chief examination under

            Order 18 or under circumstances that they may become relevant

            under                  Order        19       CPC.    The    document          shown      as

            agreement/compromise and the affidavit of Satbir s/o Mulia alone

            who is reported to be dead will be permitted to be received as

            evidence.

<p id="p_8">                                           3.        I   have   dispensed   with       notice   to   the

            respondents and proceeded to pass the order since the matter is

            covered through a decision which the Court and the parties are

            bound to take notice of. Needless to state that the defendants will

            be entitled to cross-examine the plaintiff/petitioner on all the

            documents which are now brought before court as secondary

            evidence and the cross-examination may even include any questions

            regarding the absence of justification for reception of secondary

            evidence.
