IN THE HIGH COURT OF KARNATAKA, BENGALURU

  DATED THIS THE 19TH DAY OF MARCH, 2018

                     BEFORE

      THE HON'BLE MR.JUSTICE A.S.BOPANNA

          W.P. NO.57145/2016 (LA-RES)

BETWEEN

SMT.RUDRAMBE,
W/O VEERAPPA,
AGED ABOUT 58 YEARS,
R/AT RAVINDRA NAGARA,
6TH AND 7TH CROSS,
BESIDE CHANNEL, SHIMOGA,
GUARDIAN OF SRI.VEERAPPA,
S/O MALLAMMA,
AGED ABOUT 68 YEARS.              ... PETITIONER

(BY SRI.K.DIWAKARA, ADV.)

AND

SPECIAL LAND ACQUISITION OFFICER,
UPPER TUNGA PROJECT,
SHIMOGA CITY,
SHIMOGA DISTRICT - 577 201.       ... RESPONDENT

(BY SRI.DILDAR SHIRALLI, HCGP.)

     THIS WRIT PETITION IS FILED UNDER ARTICLES
226 AND 227 OF THE CONSTITUTION OF INDIA
PRAYING TO DIRECT THE RESPONDENT TO PAY THE
COMPENSATION UNDER SECTION 23 OF THE LAND
ACQUISITION ACT AS PER JUDGMENT AND DECREE
DT.17.03.2012 IN LAC NO.132/2006 PENDING ON THE
FILE OF SENIOR CIVIL JUDGE. HEARING IN
ACCORDANCE WITH THE ORDER OF HON'BLE HIGH
                           2




COURT IN MFA NO.6847/2012 DTD.29.01.2014 VIDE
ANNEXURE-B.

     THIS WRIT PETITION COMING ON FOR ORDERS
THIS DAY, THE COURT PASSED THE FOLLOWING:

                       ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">     Learned Government Advocate to accept notice

for respondent and file Memo of Appearance in four

weeks.
</p>
<p id="p_2">     2. The petitioner is before this court seeking that

the respondent be directed to pay the compensation in

terms as ordered in LAC No.132/2006 enhanced in MFA

No.6847/2012 (LAC).
</p>
<p id="p_3">     3. The husband of the petitioner had sought for

Reference to consider the appropriate quantum of

compensation after determining the appropriate market

value of the property. The same was registered in LAC

No.132/2006 and the Reference Court had determined

the market value at      Rs.2,70,000/- per acre. The

husband of the petitioner seeking further enhancement,

was before this court in MFA No.6847/2012(LAC). The

Hon'ble Division Bench of this court had modified the

award passed by the Reference Court and had enhanced
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                              3</span>




the market value to Rs.9,36,810/- per acre with all

statutory benefits.
</p>
<p id="p_4">      4.   The grievance of the petitioner is that the

amount as ordered therein has not been calculated and

paid to the petitioner, though a portion of the amount

has been paid by the respondent. It is in that view, the

petitioner is before this court.
</p>
<p id="p_5">      5.    In a matter of the present nature, the

calculation of the actual amount payable is to be worked

out and is to be recovered.        Hence, it is for the

petitioner to file appropriate Execution Petition with

such calculation seeking recovery of the amount since

these aspects of the matter cannot be considered in a

Writ Petition of the present nature. Hence, to that

extent, liberty is reserved to the petitioner to file an

appropriate Execution Petition in accordance with law.


</p><p id="p_6">      In terms thereof, the Petition stands disposed of.
