      IN THE HIGH COURT OF PUNJAB AND HARYANA AT
                     CHANDIGARH


                          Civil Writ Petition No. 5814 of 2010
                          Date of decision : 16.11.2011
Upkar Singh
                                                          ....Petitioner

                                 V/s

State of Punjab and others
                                                          ....Respondents</pre>


<p id="p_1">BEFORE : HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE RAJAN GUPTA

Present:      Mr. Manu K. Bhandari, Advocate for the petitioner.

</p><p id="p_2">              Mr. B.S. Chahal, DAG Punjab.
</p>
<p id="p_3">RAJAN GUPTA J. (ORAL)

              The petitioner has sought quashing of order dated 08.01.2010,

Annexure P-12 whereby his request for permitting him to join Department

of Sports (respondent No. 4) has been rejected on the ground that it was not

feasible to transfer his services to said department.

</p><p id="p_4">              Learned counsel for the petitioner has contended that petitioner

is the only person serving in Education Department. All the employees

similarly placed as the petitioner have already been transferred to

Department of Sports and thus prayer of the petitioner has been wrongly

rejected. According to him, the impugned decision is infact arbitrary and

thus violative of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_1">Article 14</a> of the Constitution of India. He prays that the

same be quashed by this court.
</p>
<p id="p_5">              The prayer has, however, been vehemently opposed by learned

State counsel. He submits that pursuant to direction issued by this court in
 Civil Writ Petition No. 5814 of 2010
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">      2</span>



CWP No. 16694 of 1996 decided on 12.12.2000, options were invited from

the coaches working in the Department of School Education for transfer to

the Sports Department. However, petitioner was not willing and thus he

was retained in his parent department. Later, when a representation was

submitted by him, it was found that it was not practically feasible to transfer

his services. Besides there being no proposal to abolish the post occupied

by the petitioner in the Education Department, in light of option given by

him vide Annexure R-1, he is being retained in the parent department.

</p><p id="p_6">             I have heard learned counsel for the parties and given careful

thought to the facts of the case.
</p>
<p id="p_7">             It appears that petitioner joined the Education Department in

the year 1987 as a Kho-kho coach.          He continued to serve the said

department for number of years. In the year 1993, State of Punjab proposed

merger of three departments i.e. Sports, Punjab Panchyati Raj Khel Parishad

and the Sports Wing of the Education Department. The proposed merger

was, however, quashed by this court. Another notification was thereafter

issued by the Government on 23.02.1998 and it was stipulated therein that

effected employees would be given an option for transfer to the new

department. This notification was also challenged before this court vide

CWP No. 16694 of 1996. The petition was disposed of in terms of the

earlier judgment. It was, however, observed as under:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">                    "We have heard counsel for the parties and without
             going into merits of the claims made herein, we dispose of
             these writ petitions with a direction to the respondents to issue
             fresh notices to each of the petitioners individually seeking
             their option whether they would like to join the new
             Department. Let this be done within two weeks from the date
 Civil Writ Petition No. 5814 of 2010
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">      3</span>



            of receipt of a copy of this order. Petitioners on receipt of
            such notices will submit their response to the competent
            authority within four weeks from the date of receipt of such
            notices. Thereafter, the competent authority will take a final
            decision in the matter in accordance with law and in the light
            of the observations made by the Division Bench in Avtar
            Singh's case (supra). No costs"</blockquote><p id="p_8">

</p><p id="p_9">            Pursuant to aforesaid direction, options were invited from the

employees. The petitioner also gave an option which was conditional in

nature. The same is reproduced herein below for ready reference:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">                  "With due deference, it is submitted that I have option of
            continuing in the present Department, I would prefer to
            continu here.    But in case I have no such, option and my
            present cadre best is going to be abolished, in that case I am
            enclosing the option for posting in the newly created
            department of sports and youth services in the Performa (with
            a little addition that at first the conditions of service in the new
            Department may kindly be determined and clarified, As
            explained in the a detailed note attached to the option."</blockquote><p id="p_10">

</p><p id="p_11">            In terms of aforesaid option given by the petitioner, he was

retained in his parent department and was never transferred to the Sports

Department. Aggrieved, he served a legal notice on the respondents. Since

no decision was taken thereon, he filed CWP No. 5390 of 2002. The said

writ petition was disposed of on 25.04.2006 with a direction to the

competent authority to take a decision within a period of four months. A

speaking order was thereafter passed which has been impugned in the

instant writ petition. A perusal of the impugned order shows that request of

the petitioner has been rejected on the ground that from the option given by

him it was clear that he was not willing to be transferred to the Sports
 Civil Writ Petition No. 5814 of 2010
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">       4</span>



Department.     The belated claim made by him was rejected with the

observation that it was not practically feasible to transfer his services to the

Sports Department.
</p>
<p id="p_12">              In view of stand taken before this court by State that there is no

proposal to abolish the post which the petitioner is occupying, there appears

to be no ground to accept the prayer of the petitioner for transfer to Sports

Department. In the option dated 07.03.2001, Annexure R-1 given by the

petitioner he has clearly stated that he would prefer to continue in his parent

department. Only in the eventuality of his cadre being abolished, he would

opt for transfer to Sports Department. As there is no proposal for abolition

of the post held by the petitioner, he has no case to press his claim. In view

of preference given by him, the department has decided to retain him in the

parent department.
</p>
<p id="p_13">              I thus find no ground for interference in writ jurisdiction of this

court. The petition is without any merit and is hereby dismissed.
