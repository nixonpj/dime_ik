                                     In The High Court At Calcutta
                                  Criminal Miscellaneous Jurisdiction

          The Hon'ble Mr. Justice Dr. Mrinal Kanti Chaudhuri

  Heard on:November 28, 2013
  Order on: November 28, 2013

</pre><p id="p_2">         Jayanta Kumar Biswas,J: The petitioner accused of offences under ss.395/412 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_1">IPC</a> and
in custody from July 23, 2013 is seeking bail under s.439 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_2">CrPC</a>.
</p><p id="p_3">         ,




         The court below has refused bail on September 21, 2013 without giving any specific
reason.
</p>
<p id="p_4">         Advocate for the petitioner has submitted as follows.     The petitioner is entitled to be
treated on same footing as one Sk. Firoj and one Sk. Niamat who have been granted bail by this
court on November 4, 2013 in CRM No.14207 of 2013. Since Sk. Firoj and Sk. Niamat were also
identified in TI parade, like the petitioner, and stolen articles were recovered also from Sk.Firoj
and Sk. Niamat, the petitioner is entitled to equality benefit.
</p>
<p id="p_5">         Advocate for the State has produced the case diary and relied on the seizure list at pp.27-
28 and the test identification sheet at p.37.
</p>
<p id="p_6">         The order of this court dated November 4, 2013 is quoted below:-
         "We have heard the learned advocates of both the sides. We have also looked into the case
diary.
</p><p id="p_7">        The learned advocate appearing for the petitioners places before this Court an order
granting bail to one of the accused persons.
</p><p id="p_8">        Considering the attending circumstances and the materials available in the case diary, we
are of the view that the present petitioners should be released on bail.
</p><p id="p_9">        Accordingly, the petitioners namely, Sk. Firoj and Sk. Niamat @ Sabir, shall be released on
bail of Rs.10,000/- each, with two sureties of like amount, one of whom must be local, to the
satisfaction of the learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Paschim Medinipur, subject to the condition
that the petitioners shall meet the Officer-in-Charge of the Daspur Police Station once in a week
until further orders.
</p><p id="p_10">        The application for bail is thus, disposed of."
</p>
<p id="p_11">         Advocate for the petitioner has submitted that the order referred to in the order dated
November 4, 2013 is dated October 24, 2013 in CRM No.13777 of 2013 granting bail to one
Arshed Khan. He has produced a copy of the order.
</p>

<p id="p_12">         The order of this court dated October 24, 2013 is quoted below:-
        "Heard the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the parties and perused the case diary.
        It is submitted on behalf of the petitioner that the petitioner's vehicle was used in the
alleged dacoity and he was not placed in T.I. Parade. Investigation is also complete.
</p><p id="p_13">        Bearing in mind the extent of involvement of the petitioner and the fact that the
investigation is complete, we direct that the petitioner shall be released on bail of Rs.10,000/-
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                                   2</span>




<p id="p_14"> with two sureties of like amount, one of whom must be local, to the satisfaction of the learned
 Chief Judicial Magistrate, Paschim Medinipur, on condition that the petitioner shall meet the
 Officer-in-Charge,Daspur Police Station, once a week until further orders.
</p><p id="p_15">         The application for bail is, thus, allowed."
</p>
<p id="p_16">         The case diary materials reveal the following facts. On the night of July 21, 2013 at 1.15
 a.m un-known dacoits armed with deadly weapons raided the de facto complainant's shop (brass
 utensils and silver ornaments) with a vehicle and committed the dacoity. The dacoits took away
 brass utensils and silver ornaments. From four accused including Sk. Firoj, Sk. Niamat and the
 petitioner, but not Arshed, huge quantity of stolen articles (brass utensils and silver ornaments)
 were seized on July 21, 2013 between 10.15 a.m. and 11.15 a.m. and on August 2, 2013 between
 9.05 p.m. and 9.50 p.m.        The vehicle used for committing the dacoity and mentioned in the
 information dated July 21, 2013 leading to registration of FIR was also seized on July 21, 2013
 from the possession of the four accused. All the accused including the petitioner were identified
 in TI parade. Charge-sheet has been submitted against seven accused.
</p>
<p id="p_17">         It is evident from the order of this court dated October 24, 2013 that Arshed Khan was
 granted bail on the grounds that he, the owner of the vehicle used for committing the dacoity,
 was not placed in TI parade.        The order of this court dated November 4, 2013 reveals that
 attention of the court was not drawn to the seizure list showing recovery of huge quantity of
 stolen articles from the accused named therein (including the petitioner).         It was also not
 mentioned to the court that the accused had been identified in TI parade.
</p>
<p id="p_18">         The case diary materials on the basis whereof charge-sheet has been submitted make out
 a very strong prosecution case against the petitioner. There is good chance of conviction. Bail to
 him, in our opinion, is bound to affect the general interest of the society and trial of the case. It
 is a case of his custodial trial.
</p>
<p id="p_19">         For these reasons, we dismiss the CRM. Certified xerox.</p><pre id="pre_2">
