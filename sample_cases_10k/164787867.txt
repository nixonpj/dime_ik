</pre>
<p id="p_1">                   The petitioner was accused of committing offence under

  <a href="/doc/1371604/" id="a_1">Sections 304-A</a>, <a href="/doc/1270101/" id="a_2">279</a>, <a href="/doc/1402213/" id="a_3">337</a> and <a href="/doc/222396/" id="a_4">427</a> of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860).

  Accordingly, FIR No.235 dated 06.11.2011, was registered against him at

  Police Station City Tarn Taran.
</p>
<p id="p_2">  2                The     petitioner      was     the   driver   of   a    bus,    bearing

  No.PB-05-Q-0888, owned by Abohar-Fazilka Cooperative Transport

  Society Limited.           It hit the motorcycle being driven by father of

  complainant-Jagmohan Singh from behind. Smt. Gurjit Kaur-mother of

  the complainant, fell down from the motorcycle and was crushed under

  the tyre of the bus and died at the spot.
</p>
<p id="p_3">  3                The petitioner was tried and convicted vide impugned

  judgment dated 22.07.2014 and was sentenced as under:-

Section of <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_5">I.P.C</a>             RI               Fine             I/D of payment of fine

 4           His appeal has been dismissed vide impugned judgment

dated 25.07.2017. Thus, the instant revision petition has been preferred.

5           Notice of motion was issued only on the quantum of

sentence.
</p>
<p id="p_4">6           Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the petitioner

is the only bread winner of the family and that he does not have any

criminal antecedents. He has suffered incarceration for a period in excess

of one year and six months and thus, his sentence may be modified to the

period already undergone by him.
</p>
<p id="p_5">7           Custody certificate dated 06.10.2018, by way of an affidavit

of Sh. Harpreet Singh, PPS, Deputy Superintendent, Sub Jail, Patti, has

been filed by the learned State counsel in Court today and the same is

taken on record.       According to this certificate, the petitioner has

undergone actual custody of one year, seven months and twenty eight

days. There is no other criminal case pending/decided against him.

8           It is, thus, apparent that the petitioner is not a hardened

criminal. No other criminal case is pending/decided against him, even for

a road accident. The FIR is of the year 2011 and judgment of conviction

is of the year 2014 and thus, apart from having undergone trial for a

period of three years the petitioner has also suffered actual incarceration

of one year, seven months and twenty eight days.

9           Keeping in view above facts, the impugned judgment of

conviction dated 22.07.2014, passed by Chief Judicial Magistrate, Tarn

Taran and as upheld by the Addl. Sessions Judge, Tarn Taran, vide

judgment dated 25.07.2017 is maintained.            So far as, the order of



                               2 of 3

 sentence, is concerned, the same is modified and the petitioner is

sentenced to the period already undergone by him.

10                With the above modification in the sentence part, instant

revision petition is dismissed. It is ordered that the petitioner-Gurwinder

Singh, be released from the custody forthwith, in case he is not required

in any other case.

<p id="p_6">11                A copy of this order be sent to the Court of Chief Judicial

Magistrate, Tarn Taran, for compliance.</p><pre id="pre_2">
