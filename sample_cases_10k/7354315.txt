<p id="p_13">   The two appeals arise out of judgment dated 18.2.2009 passed by the

   learned Presiding Officer of Fast Track Court-V,Siwan, in Sessions Trial

   No. 90 of 2008/36 of 2008 by which the three appellants were held guilty

   of committing offences under <a href="/doc/1119707/" id="a_1">Sections 395</a>/<a href="/doc/844968/" id="a_2">412</a> of the Indian Penal Code

   while the 4th accused who was also put on trial in the same Sessions Trial,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                                                                 2</span>




namely, Rabindra Choudhary, was acquitted of the two offences. The

appellants were heard on sentence on 21.2.2009 and it appears that the

learned trial court did not sentence them for committing the offence under

<a href="/doc/1119707/" id="a_3">Section 395</a> of the Indian Penal Code and directed each of the appellants

to suffer rigorous imprisonment for seven years as also to pay a fine of Rs.

5,000/-, else, to suffer rigorous imprisonment for a further period of one

year under <a href="/doc/844968/" id="a_4">Section 412</a> of the Indian Penal Code.
</p>
<p id="p_14">2.        The prosecution case is based on a written report(Ext.2) of M.

Farhan Hafiz(P.W. 12) in which he stated that on 29.10.2007 at about 1.20

P.M. he accompanied by one Rana Kumar Singh, both employees of

P.A.C.L. India Ltd., Lal Place Complex, Station Road , Siwan , was

carrying Rs. 13,68,000/- and was going to State Bank of India, Main

Branch, Siwan for depositing the same. The informant(P.W. 12) and his

companion Rana Kumar Singh were travelling in the Alto Car bearing

registration no.BR-IZ 5900. All on a sudden, the two criminals who were

in the age group of thirty five to forty years and were armed with pistols

came and at the gun point relieved the informant of the bag containing the

above amount and sped away by a motorcycle bearing registration no. BR-

5451. The motorcycle was Suzuki.
</p>
<p id="p_15">3.       It appears that on the basis of the report( Ext.2) the F.I.R. of the

case was drawn up and the investigation was taken up by P.W. 18,

S.I.Rajesh Kumar Rai who on the above date was the Officer-in-charge of

Town Police Station, Siwan. He stated that after having registered the case

he went to inspect the place of occurrence which was the road situated at a

particular place which has been described as „Shantibat briksha‟. The

occurrence had taken place on the eastern flank of the road and the Maruti

Car by which the informant along with his companion Rana Kumar Singh(
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                                                              3</span>




not examined) was travelling, was still lying there. The Investigating

Officer( P.W. 18) also appears inspecting the office of P.A.C.L. India

Ltd and thereafter appears recording further statement of the informant

and statements of other witnesses. The Investigating Officer started

suspecting hands in the commission of offences of the appellants Nitin Raj

Srivastava and Ekhlaque Ahmad and, accordingly, started a hunt for the

two accused persons. The houses of the appellants were raided by the

police and the Officer-in-charge of Siwan Muffasil Police Station, i.e.,

P.W. 17 Brijendra Kumar Shahi passed on an information to him that

appellant Rajesh Manjhi had been seen at Kutchery Railway Station,

Siwan, and the information was, as such, reduced into station diary entry

no. 130 dated 5.11.2007 and thereafter P.W. 18 came to the railway

station, Siwan, and arrested appellant Rajesh Manjhi who was also

questioned by the police and during that course, as may appear from the

evidence of P.W. 18 in paragraph 7, this appellant confessed to his guilt

and, accordingly, confessional statement of appellant Rajesh Manjhi was

reduced into writing by P.W. 17, S.I. B.K.Shahi of Muffasil Police

Station, Siwan. The confessional statement of appellant Rajesh Manjhi has

been marked Ext. 4/1. while confessing his guilt, appellant Rajesh Manjhi

appears pointing out that rupees two lacs which was the part of the looted

money was lying in an Almirah in his house and, accordingly, the police

officers, i.e., P.Ws. 16, 17 and 18 came to the house of appellant Rajesh

Manjhi situated in Bidurli Hata, Siwan, and on pointing out by him the

police party appears entering the room which was facing south and in the

drawer of the Steel Almirah found rupees two lacs kept there, the bundles

of which were still bearing the seals of S.B.I. and PACL over them. The

bundles of money were seized and, accordingly, the seizure memo was
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                                                               4</span>




prepared in presence of P.W. 2 Manoj Kumar and P.W. 11 Ajay Kumar

Baitha. The seizure memo has been marked Ext.3. The copy of the seizure

memo(Ext.3) was handed over to appellant Rajesh Manjhi and he signed it

in token thereof.
</p>
<p id="p_16">4.     The Police party, thereafter, left the house of appellant Rajesh

Manjhi as they had some information while they were coming back that

the two appellants Ekhlaque Ahmad and Nitin Raj Srivastava who was

also described as Munshi Srivastava were at a place near the house of

appellant Ekhlaque Ahmad and, accordingly, the police party came there

and found the two appellants who on seeing the police party started

running away. But, they were chased and arrested. The two appellants

were also separately questioned and their statements were recorded, as

may appear from the evidence of P.W.18 as also from the record of

confession of appellants Nitik Raj Srivastava which was recorded by P.W.

16 Polendra Singh and was marked Ext. 4. Likewise, the confessional

statement of appellant Ekhlaque Ahmad was recorded by S.I. Brijendra

Kumar Shahi( P.W. 17) and that has been marked Ext. 4/2.             While

confessing to their guilt, the two appellants, namely, Nitin Raj Srivastava

and Ekhlaque Ahmad also pointed out that they had in their respective

possessions some part of booty. As per the confessional statement of

appellant Ekhlaque Ahmad the part of the booty which was handed over to

him was shared by him with Bashsir Mian alias S.P. Mian and that was

kept in his house and could be found there. Accordingly, the Investigating

officer went to the house of Bashir Mian alias S.P. Mian located at Shukla

Toli, P.S. Siwan Town and on the pointing out of appellant Ekhlaque

Ahmad a search of iron trunk which was kept by the side of southern wall

of the house was made and he found rupees fifty six thousand which was
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                                                              5</span>




kept wrapped into a cloth piece. Those notes of money were carrying the

seals of State Bank of India and PACL. The seizure memo was prepared

after seizing the above fifty six thousand rupees and that seizure memo

has been marked Ext. 3/1.
</p>
<p id="p_17">5.      Appellant Nitin Raj Srivastava alias Munshi Srivastava, during his

confession pointed out that he had kept the part of booty in the trunk

located in his house and, accordingly, police stepped into his house which

was the tenanted house owned and possessed by one Upendra Paswan

situated in same locality of Siwan and on pointing out by appellant Nitin

Raj Srivastava alias Munshi Srivastava the trunk was opened which was

kept by the side of the wall of the house and rupees two lac was recovered

from the stack of clothes and, accordingl,y seizure memo(Ext. 3/2) was

prepared in presence of the witnesses, i.e., P.W. Suman Kumar and P.W.

Bibhas Ranjan and the notes of money recovered were bearing the seals of

State Bank of India and PACL.
</p>
<p id="p_18">6.     During the course of investigation, the police also came to know

that the motorcycle which was used in commission of the offence was

lying in the house of one Suresh Pandey and, accordingly, the police went

there and found that a Suzuki motorcycle was standing in the verandah of

the hose of Suresh Pandey and accordingly the motorcycle was seized by

preparing Ext. 3/4

</p><p id="p_19">7.     P.W 17 S.I. Brijendra Kumar Shahi informed the Investigating

Officer of the case P.W. 18 that one Rabindra Chaudhary was available

who had been found with rupees one lac and accordingly he was arrested

and seized the bundle of the above notes by preparing seizure report

which has been marked Ext. 3/2.
</p>
<p id="p_20">8.     It appears further from the evidence of P.W.18 that the police
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                                                                  6</span>




obtained the three appellants on police remand through judicial orders and

during the course of questioning them, it came to light that some part of

looted properties were in the house of one S.P. Mian and the police party

went there and from the particular room recovered rupees ninety two

thousand and accordingly Ext. 3/5 was prepared in presence of the

witnesses.
</p>
<p id="p_21">9.     The statements of the witnesses were recorded and finding

materials sufficient against the appellants the appellants were sent for their

trial which ultimately ended in their conviction by the impugned

judgment.
</p>
<p id="p_22">10.          Shri Ajay Kumar Thakur, learned counsel for the appellant

Rajesh Manjhi was submitting by making reference to paragraphs 19.20

and 40 to44 of the evidence of P.W. 17 that the mother of appellant Rajesh

Manjhi had filed Cr. Misc. petition before the Chief Judicial Magistrate,

Siwan( Ext. C) on account of the father of appellant Rajesh Manjhi being

illegally arrested and confined bythe        Investigating Officer. It was

submitted that the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Siwan had passed orders on

that petition directing P.W. 17 to produce the father of appellant Rajesh

Manjhi, which may appear from Ext.A and A/1, but the father of the

appellant Rajesh Manjhi was not          produced resulting into filing of

Criminal Writ Jurisdiction Case No. 2002 of 2005 and because P.W. 17

was not appearing before this Court as per its direction to file affidavit,

the Superintendent of Police, Siwan put him under suspension and that

was the reason that the he had falsely implicated the appellant Rajesh

Manjhi.
</p>
<p id="p_23">11.       I was taken through the above paragraphs of the evidence of P.W.

17 in the above connection. It was contended that there was no material
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                                                                  7</span>




indicating as to how P.W. 17 came to know that appellant Rajesh Manjhi

was at Kutchery Railway Station, Siwan and further, after arresting the

appellant no information was given to the G.R.P.S. regarding that fact at

that particular station. It was contended that if the whole story is like that

as regards appellant Rajesh       Manjhi, then his participation       in the

commission of crime and subsequent recovery of the part of the looted

money appears a hoax.
</p>
<p id="p_24">12.    So far as remaining two appellants Ekhlaque Ahmad and Nitin Raj

Srivastava alias Munshi Srivastava are concerned, Shri Ashok Kumar

Mishra, learned counsel appearing on their behalf was virtually

questioning the very identification of the recovered properties. It was

submitted that if at all the properties were bearing the seals of PACL then

it was highly desirable that      they ought to have been put on Test

Identification Parade and the evidence of organizing that parade by the

Officer/ authority and the chart thereof ought to have been obtained and

produced in court.
</p>
<p id="p_25">13.    There is specific rule framed by the Bihar Police Manual, 1978 by

Rule 236 for identification of suspected goods or suspected theft property.

If one could consider Rule 236(b) of the Bihar Police Manual one could

find that if the articles which are subject matter of theft or if they appear

having some specific identifying marks then in that case there could not

be any necessitity of organizing the Test Identification Parade and putting

the articles for identification by the witnesses. A similar point was raised

before a Division Bench of this Court in State of Bihar Vs. Shankar

Kanu and ors reported in 2010(3) P.L.J.R. 427 and the Division Bench

was replying to the above submission in paragraph 59 of the judgment.

The judgment was being written by me as part of the Division Bench and I
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                                                                8</span>




was pointing out the same rule as regards the need of holding the T.I.

Parade if the properties were already bearing some specific identifying

marks.
</p>
<p id="p_26">14.      Coming to the facts of the present case it was never disputed

during the whole trial that the properties which were recovered were not

bearing the seals of the State Bank of India as also that of PACL. The

currency notes with which P.W. 12 accompanied by another employee

Rana Kumar Singh was proceeding           to the State Bank of India for

depositing the same, were produced, as may appear from the lower court

records, in court and they were marked material Exhts I to IV on different

dates as may appear from the sheets of material exhibits which are at

pages 155 to 156 of the lower court records. It appears further from the

evidence of the witnesses as may appear from the trial court‟s records,

specially the orders passed on 18.6.2008 and 27.6.2008 that after marking

all notes as material exhibits, the court was again handing over those

properties to the witness, i.e., S.I. Polendra Singh( P.W. 16) who had

produced the currency notes before the court for tendering them in

evidence. It was not suggested even to P.W. 17 or any of the witnesses

who could have testified to the above fact that the currency notes were not

belonging to the PACL and on account of thatfact they were not the

subject matter of theft and, further, that they had been handed over to him

to create evidence. In absence of that particular evidence on that, I do not

see any reason to reject the prosecution evidence on which I am coming a

bit later.
</p>
<p id="p_27">15.          Shri Thakur, learned counsel for appellant Rajesh Manjhi was

placing the admitted fact brought on record through the evidence of P.W.

17, as may appear in paragraphs 19,20, 40 and 44 about the filing of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                                                                 9</span>




complaint Ext. C before the Chief Judicial magistrate, Siwan informing

him about the illegal arrest of the father of appellant Rajesh Manjhi which

was numbered as Cr. Misc. No. 202 of 2006 and orders were passed on

several dates, as may appear from Exts. A and A/1. However, P.W. 17 has

specifically stated that the father of appellant Rajesh Manjhi had some

past activities in respect of certain theft or robbery, as such, he was

remanded to custody. The documents may not have been available but I

could very well understand as to why this Court could not have passed

orders on the Criminal Writ Jurisdiction Case No. 2002 of 2005 when the

arrest was in connection with the substantive offence which had already

been registered and was being investigated into. This Court could never

have intervened on treating the case of arrest and detention as a matter of

legal detention and could not have passed orders on account of which

P.W. 17 was to be put under suspension by the higher Officers and on that

account he was bearing an ire against appellant Rajeshd Manjhi. The

submission of Shri Thakur that on account of the above ground he had

been suspended could not be accepted.
</p>
<p id="p_28">16.    It was contended that there was no whisper as to how the police

came to know that appellant Rajesh Manjhi was available at Kutchery

railway station, Siwan. I have discussed the evidence of P.W. 18, the

Investigating Officer of the case. He has stated that he was suspecting

from the very inception of the case the hands of Ekhlaque Ahmad and

Rajesh Manjhi in the commission of the offence and that was the reason

that raids had been conducted in their respective houses also. The police, it

could be understood, was on a look out for the appellants and they must

have alerted their agency which could be secret agency also, to inform

them about the movement of the appellants. P.W. 18 has stated the above
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                                                             10</span>




fact in paragraph 4 and further in paragraph 7 of his evidence that he was

informed by the Officer-in-charge of Siwan Mufassil Police Station, i.e.,

P.W. 17, that Rajesh Manjhi was present at the platform of Kutchery

railway Station, Siwan. Accordingly, P.Ws. 16,17 and 18 reached there

and found Rajesh Manjhi and arrested him. There is no denial that Rajesh

Manjhi was arrested and there is also no denial that appellant Rajesh

Manjhi was questioned and further that he confessed to his guilt. There

might also be nothing coming from the confessional statement (Ext.4/1) of

appellant Rajesh Manjhi as regards the commission of the offence, but so

far as the information which was dropped by appellant Rajesh Manjhi

regarding concealment of rupees three lacs which was part of the looted

property is concerned, the information was quite admissible under <a href="/doc/1312051/" id="a_5">Section

27</a> of the Evidence Act. Thus, the police party, as may appear from the

above information, were quite aware of the movement of the appellants,

especially, appellant Rajesh Manjhi and accordingly he was arrested.

</p><p id="p_29">17.    It might be a fact that the appellant Rajesh Manjhi was within the

jurisdiction of G.R.P.S., Siwan, but he was arrested in a case for

commission of the offence which was already registered by the Town

Police Station, Siwan, on the basis of Ext. 2 the written report of P.W. 12

and, as such, there was no need of informing the Officer-in-charge of the

G.R.P.S. or taking help from him in affecting his arrest. Moreover,

appellant Rajesh Manjhi was not residing in the jurisdiction of G.R.P.S. It

was a chance presence of appellant Rajesh Manjhi that he was there at the

platform of Siwan Kutchery railway station and that may not be making it

mandatory that G.R.P.S., Siwan ought to have been informed.

</p><p id="p_30">18.        The evidence of leading the police to enter into the houses of

the appellants and further fact as regards the place where the part of looted
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                                                           11</span>




properties were concealed appear coming out of the respective confessions

of the three appellants. Rajesh Manjhi was pointing out something on

account of which he could be implicated by the police. So far the other

two appellants, i.e., Ekhlaque Ahmad and Nitin Raj Srivastava are

concerned, the defence is too specific to carry any reason to have the

police so much enthusiastic or adamant to arrest innocent persons like

them or to implicate them in such offence and         on that basis their

participation in the offence and recovery of the looted properties retained

by them could not be ruled out.
</p>
<p id="p_31">19.      The factum of the offence has been proved by examining the

witnesses, like, P.Ws. 6, 12 and 15. P.Ws. 6 and 12 though have been

declared hostile, but from some part of their evidence in cross-

examination, as regards snatching of the bag by the criminals, appears

established. The identification was not there. In fact, there was no

evidence on identification during the trial. It was only the evidence of

confession of the appellants leading to recovery of money. The seizure list

witnesses might have turned hostile but they had put their signatures on

the seizure report. While they were signing the paper they were perfectly

knowing the details. This Court could not appreciate as to how they could

know that the paper on which the very S.I. of Police was asking them to

put their signature was to be utilized as seizure memo unless they were

party to the entire exercise. This Court has the above inkling from the

evidence of P.Ws. 2 and 9, the seizure list witnesses who were examined

during the course of trial.
</p>
<p id="p_32">20.        I have considered the evidence and on such consideration of the

evidence, what I find is that there were only two criminals who had

arrived at the scene of the occurrence and at the gun point relieved the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                                                                              12</span>




informant of the bag containing Rs. 13,68,000/- from his possession.

There is no evidence further that there were more number of accused and

the finding recorded by the learned trial Judge and the conviction of the

three appellants for committing the offence under <a href="/doc/1119707/" id="a_6">Section 395</a> of the

Indian Penal Code could not be sustained. In my considered view, the

offence could be under <a href="/doc/261195/" id="a_7">Section 392</a> of the Indian penal Code which could

be said to have been committed by the two appellants and not under

<a href="/doc/1119707/" id="a_8">Section 395</a> of the Indian Penal Code. As such, I give benefit of doubt to

all the three appellants and acquit them of the offence under <a href="/doc/261195/" id="a_9">Section 395</a>

of the Indian penal Code, in absence of evidence of identification.

</p><p id="p_33">21.        However, <a href="/doc/246035/" id="a_10">Section 114(a)</a> of the Evidence Act, says that a man

who is in possession of stolen goods soon after the theft is either the thief

or has received the goods knowing them to be stolen, unless he can

account for his possession. It is in the above context that in order to apply

<a href="/doc/246035/" id="a_11">Section 114(a)</a> of the Evidence Act it is necessary for the prosecution to

show that there was quite some proximity between the offence and the

recovery of the property. It was contended that the recovery was made on

5.11.2007 while the occurrence had taken place at about 1.20 P.M. on

29.10.2007, about a week earlier. Similar point was raised in the case of

Shanker Kanu(Supra) in which the Division Bench. was considering the

term " soon after the theft". In that case recoveries of theft properties were

made after thirteen days of the occurrence under some circumstances on

confessional statements of the persons who were caught by the police on

picking up a telephonic call on the mobile which was belonging to the

deceased. The Court was pointing out that after considering the facts, in

spite of there being time lag of twelve to thirteen days of commission of

the offence, the recovery, considering the nature of the offence, could be
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                                                                             13</span>




just after the incident on the special facts of that particular case. Coming

to the present case, there was some suspicion from the very inception of

the case against appellant Rajesh Manjhi and Ekhlaque Ahmad that they

might have participated in commission of the offence, but as regards the

recovery which could be made was within six or seven days of the

commission of the offence from the rooms of the respective houses of the

appellants and others raising the probability that some one could have

transferred   for concealment of the properties after its possession. As

regards the transferred possession of the same, it was only when the room

of one of the appellants was searched along with other appellants that the

another part of the booty was found concealed and they could lay hands

on them only on their pointing.     The facts of the present case make the

situation akin to that of the case of Shanker Kanu( Supra) and

considering the recovery it could not be said to be distinct. I have

acquitted the appellants of the commission of the offence under <a href="/doc/1119707/" id="a_12">Section

395</a> of the Indian Penal Code. But, as regards the retention part of the theft

property obtained by commission of the offence of robbery which might

or might not have been committed by the appellants brings the case within

the ambit of <a href="/doc/844968/" id="a_13">Section 412</a> of the Indian Penal Code.             After having

convicted the appellants for committing the offence under <a href="/doc/844968/" id="a_14">Section 412</a> of

the Indian Penal Code, the learned trial Judge directed each of the

appellants to suffer a term rigorous imprisonment for seven years as also

directed each of them to pay a fine of Rs. 5,000/-, else, to suffer rigorous

imprisonment for one year more. Considering that the age of appellant

Rajesh Manjhi was 28 years, that of appellant Ekhlaque Ahmad was aged

32 years, that of appellant Nitin Raj Srivastava alias Munshi Srivastava

swas 32 years, two of them, like appellants Rajesh Manjhi and Nitin Raj
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                                                                                         14</span>




             Srivastava alias Munshi Srivastava were at the very threshold of their lives

             and it has not been proved with perfection that they had participated in the

             commission of the offence, the sentence of seven years rigorous

             imprisonment awarded to the appellants under <a href="/doc/844968/" id="a_15">Section 412</a> of the Indian

             Penal Code is reduced to five years and the appellants are directed to pay

             the sentence of fine as was imposed upon them by the trial court.

</p><p id="p_34">             22.     With the above modification in finding of guilt against the

             appellants under <a href="/doc/1119707/" id="a_16">Section 395</a> of the Indian Penal Code for which I have

             acquitted them and the modification in their sentence under <a href="/doc/844968/" id="a_17">Section 412</a> of

             the Indian Penal Code, both the appeals are dismissed.
