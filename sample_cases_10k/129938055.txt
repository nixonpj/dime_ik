</p>




<p id="p_2">                     This appeal arises out of the judgment and award dated
             23.8.2008 passed by the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal,
             Chandrapur in M.A.C.P. No.123/2001, whereby the claimants

             death of one Pradip Ramteke occurred in a motor vehicular




                                                                                 
             accident on 7.8.2001 involving truck bearing No. MH -31-1809
             insured with the appellant. While the deceased was riding bicycle




                                                        
             he was knocked down by the truck and caused his death. He left
             behind him widow, three minor children and his mother. The




                                                       
             learned Tribunal, after considering the income of the deceased
             worked out the loss of dependency at Rs.73,200/- p.a. and by
             applying multiplier of 16, having regard to the age of the




                                              
             deceased, awarded amount of Rs.11,81,000/-.

                         Mr. Joshi, the learned counsel for the appellant raised
             only issue regarding quantum of compensation. According to him
                               
             the widow of deceased is given compassionate employment by
             the employer i.e. Western Coalfields and in that view of the
             matter, the loss of dependency could not be Rs.73,200/- as arrived
             


             at by the learned Tribunal.
</p>          



<p id="p_3">             3]          The evidence was led to the effect that the deceased
             was employed in W.C.L. and was drawing monthly salary of





             Rs.10,195/-. The learned Tribunal considering various deductions
             held that the carry-home salary of the deceased was Rs.9475/-.
             After deducting one-third amount towards his personal and living





             expences, the learned Tribunal held that the loss of dependency
             per month comes to Rs.6100/-. The learned Tribunal rightly
             applied multiplier of 16. The only        point which            requires
             consideration is whether there ought to have been deduction on

<p id="p_4">             4]         The learned counsel for the respondent relied upon
             various decisions to support his contention that factor like widow

             others [supra] it was held that where a wife gets employment
                                 
             under Compassionate Scheme, the compensation payable is not
             liable to be reduced.
</p><p id="p_10">             8]             The aforesaid being the legal position, the submission
             


             of Mr. Joshi, that the learned Tribunal while fixing quantum of
          



             compensation failed to consider the fact that the widow got the
             employment on compassionate ground on the establishment of





             W.C.L., is devoid of force. In that view of the matter, the appeal
             lacks merit.
</p><p id="p_11">                    Appeal is dismissed. No order as to costs.
