                                 Suit No. 108/11


         Vijay Kumar &amp; Another     vs.       M.C.D. &amp; Another

</p><p id="p_2">1.             Vide  this order I shall  dispose  of an application  filed  by 

the plaintiff under Order 39 Rule 1 and 2 read with Section 151 CPC 

for an ad­interim injunction in favour of the plaintiff and against the 

defendants, thereby restraining the defendant from removing the shop 

of the plaintiffs without due process of law.  The brief facts necessary 

for the disposal of the present application are as under:



</p><p id="p_3">2.             It is the case of the plaintiff that the plaintiffs are running 

the shop Opposite Shivaji College, Near Electric Power  Station, Raja 

Garden, Delhi.   It is stated that on 22.07.2010, space for stalls were 

allotted to the plaintiffs by the defendant/MCD   on the basis of Teh 

Bazari.   It is stated that the plaintiffs have prepared their stalls and 

installed at the Teh Bazari site.  
</p>
<p id="p_4">

</p><p id="p_5">3.             It is further case of the plaintiff that on 07.07.2011,  the 

officials   of   the   MCD   came   to   the   shops/stalls   of   the   plaintiffs   and 

threatened the plaintiffs to remove their shops/stalls otherwise, they 

will lift the aforesaid stalls with the help of the police.  It is stated that 

the plaintiffs approached the Deputy Commissioner of MCD and the 

office of the Deputy Commissioner of MCD conveyed the message to 


Suit NO. 108/11                                                          Page No. 5/1
 the plaintiffs that the Deputy Commissioner of MCD has passed the 

order against the stalls of the plaintiffs.   It is further stated that the 

plaintiffs were surprised as they are waiting for aforesaid shops/stalls 

for   allotment   as   the   shops/stalls   were   allotted   on   the   basis   of   Teh 

Bazari  in the year 1975  and  the above  said  shops  were  allotted  on 

22.07.2010   after   intervention   and   order   passed   by   the   Hon'ble 

Supreme Court of India.   It is further stated that the MCD/defendant 

doing the illegal act without giving any notice to the plaintiff and the 

plaintiffs have spent Rs.1,50,000/­ for preparation of the stalls/shops 

by borrowing the same on interest.  
</p>
<p id="p_6">

</p><p id="p_7">4.              The defendant in its written statement has taken various 

preliminary objections and denied the averments made in the plaint 

by   the   plaintiff.     It   is   stated   that   this   Court   has   no   jurisdiction   to 

entertain, try and adjudicate the present suit in view of the judgment 

of Hon'ble  Supreme  Court  of India  passed  in <a href="/doc/70648728/" id="a_1">Gainda  Ram vs.  MCD</a> 

and in view of the fact that there is a provision in the scheme of MCD 

for   squatters/hawkers­2007   to   resolve   the   disputes   between   the 

allottees and the MCD filed before Hon'ble Supreme Court of India.  It 

is further stated that the plaintiffs have relied upon letter bearing no. 

AC/WZ/2010/D­869   dated   22.07.2010   issued   for   squatting 

temporarily at the impugned site.   However, due to public resistance 

and   objections   raised   by   the   land   owning   agency   i.e.   CPWD   and 

DUSIB Govt. of NCT, the said letter has been withdrawn vide letter no. 

AC/WZ/2011/D­355   dated   20.07.2011.     It   is   further   stated   that 

thereafter,   a   show   cause   notice   bearing   no.   D­738/AC/WZ   dated 

30.09.2011 was issued  to the plaintiffs, vide which they were called 

upon   to   attend   the   office   alongwith   the   proof   of   allotment   of   Teh­


Suit NO. 108/11                                                               Page No. 5/2
 Bazari in their favour, but the plaintiffs did not attend the office on 

the date fixed, however  replies were filed by them.   It is stated that 

since   the   site   in   question   is   in   non   Squatting   Zone   and   from   the 

record   available   in   the   zone   names   of   the   plaintiffs   could   not   be 

verified   from   the   list   of   eligible   Teh­Bazari   Holder   of   West   Zone, 

therefore on withdrawal of the letter bearing no. AC/WZ/2010/D­869 

dated 22.07.2010 on 20.07.2011 and as such status of the plaintiffs 

are of just  encroacher  on the  public  land  and  they are  liable  to be 

removed as per the provision as contained under Section 321­322 of 

the DMC Act without any prior notice. 
</p>
<p id="p_8">

</p><p id="p_9">5.             I have heard arguments of Ld. Counsel for the parties and 

perused the material available on record.  
</p>
<p id="p_10">

</p><p id="p_11">6.             Ld.   Counsel   for   the   plaintiffs   has   submitted   that   Teh 

Bazari site was allotted temporarily by the Municipal Corporation but 

now   without   any   ground,   officials   of   Municipal   Corporation   are 

intended to remove the shops/stalls of the plaintiffs.   He has further 

submitted that the Municipal Corporation has no right to remove the 

shops of the plaintiffs and the plaintiffs are liable to be protected from 

removing of the shops/stalls during pendency of this suit.  



</p><p id="p_12">7.             On   the   other   hand,   Ld.   Counsel   for   the   defendant   has 

submitted that the dispute involved in the present matter is under the 

jurisdiction   of   Squatting   Committee,   who   has   been   empowered   to 

settle all the disputes between the parties in respect to Teh Bazari.  




</p><p id="p_13">Suit NO. 108/11                                                          Page No. 5/3
</p><p id="p_14"> 8.             In  order to be entitled to the relief of interim injunction, 

the   plaintiff   must   show   existence   of   a  prima­facie  case,   balance   of 

convenience, irreparable loss and injury emanating from withholding 

of relief injunction.
</p>
<p id="p_15">

</p><p id="p_16">9.             This is a suit for permanent and mandatory injunction. It 

is stated in the written statement filed on behalf of the defendant that 

the plaintiffs have relied upon letter bearing no. AC/WZ/2010/D­869 

dated  22.07.2010  issued  for squatting  temporarily  at  the  impugned 

site.   However, due to public resistance and objections raised by the 

land   owning   agency   i.e.   CPWD   and   DUSIB   Govt.   of   NCT,   the   said 

letter has been withdrawn vide letter no. AC/WZ/2011/D­355 dated 

20.07.2011. It is further stated that thereafter, a show cause notice 

bearing   no.   D­738/AC/WZ   dated   30.09.2011   was   issued   to   the 

plaintiffs,   vide   which   they   were   called   upon   to   attend   the   office 

alongwith the proof of allotment of Teh­Bazari in their favour, but the 

plaintiffs did not attend the office on the date fixed.  



</p><p id="p_17">10.            It   is   not   in   dispute   that   the   plaintiffs   were   temporarily 

allotted   Teh   Bazari   site   in   dispute   in   lieu   of   their   shifting   from 

previous Teh Bazari site. Whether plaintiffs are entitled to retain this 

Teh Bazari site in dispute even after cancellation of Teh Bazari license 

or not or they  are entitled  for any  alternate  Teh Bazari  site are the 

disputes   which   can   be   decided   by   the   Squatting   Committee 

constituted   in   terms   of   order   passed   by   Hon'ble   Supreme   Court   in 

Gainda Ram's case (Supra).   This court is of the  prima­facie  opinion 

that  the  plaintiffs  should   have   exhausted   the  alternative  efficacious 

remedy  by   approaching   the Squatting   Committee.     Hence,   plaintiffs 


Suit NO. 108/11                                                           Page No. 5/4
 having alternate remedy, prima­facie not entitled for injunction even 

interim injunction. Hence, plaintiffs have no prima­facie case in their 

favour.  Further, I find that balance of convenience also does not lie in 

their   and   they   would   not   suffer   any   irreparable   loss   or   injury   if 

interim   orders   are   not   passed   in   their   favour.     Hence,   application 

under Order 39 Rule 1 and 2 CPC filed by the plaintiffs is dismissed.
