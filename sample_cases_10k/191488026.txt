                        JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">     The complainant filed this complaint against the accused for the
offence punishable under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_1">Section 138</a> of Negotiable Instruments Act.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                   2                   C.C.No.50004/2016</span>


<p id="p_2">2.   The complaint case in nutshell is that the accused is the family
friend of the complainant and approached the complainant for
financial assistance of Rs.10,00,000/- in the 1st week of Januray 2015
agreeing to repay the same within 3 months.           Accordingly the
complainant claims that on 10.01.2015 he has paid Rs.10,00,000/- in
cash to him.    On demand for repayment of money the accused
towards the discharge of said debt has issued cheque bearing
No.990938 dtd:12.04.2015 for Rs.10,00,000/- drawn on Syndicate
Bank, K.R.Puram Branch, Bengaluru.          The complainant when
presented the said cheque for encashment that has been returned
without encashment with bank memo dtd:16.04.2015 stating
"Insufficient Funds". Thereafter the complainant caused a legal
notice to the accused on 24.07.2015 calling upon the accused to pay
the cheque amount.       The complainant claims that though the
accused has the knowledge of this notice failed to comply with the
notice. Hence, filed the complaint.
</p>
<p id="p_3">3.   After filing the complaint, sworn statement of the complainant
has been recorded and on perusing the materials on record i.e.,
cheque, bank endorsement, legal notice and documents for having
been caused the notice to the accused, the court has been taken the
cognizance of offence and issued summons to the accused.
</p>
<p id="p_4">4.   In response to the summons, the accused appeared through
his counsel and he was on court bail.      Plea has been recorded;
accused pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                   3                   C.C.No.50004/2016</span>


<p id="p_5">5.   To prove the case, the complainant got examined himself as
P.W.1 and got marked documents at Ex.P.1 to P.9.
</p>
<p id="p_6">6.   On closure of complainant side evidence, the accused
statement has been recorded under Sec.313(1)(b) of <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_2">Cr.P.C</a>., by
placing the incriminating evidence appeared against the accused that
are denied by the accused.
</p>
<p id="p_7">7.   The accused examined himself as D.W.1 in support of his
defense and also got marked documents at Ex.D.1 to 4. The accused
totally denied the complaint case.     The definite defense of the
accused is that the complainant was stranger to him and he came to
know about the complainant after this case. The accused claimed
that one Lakshmikanth who is the father-in-law of the complainant
was a financier and from whom he has borrowed Rs.10,000/-. The
accused further claims that while advancing the said money the
father of the complainant has received the signed blank cheques that
has been misused by the said Manjunath and filed this case through
the complainant. Accordingly prayed for dismissal of complaint.
</p>

<p id="p_8">8.   On the basis of above, the point for consideration is that;
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">        "Whether the complainant has proved that the
        accused has committed the offence punishable
        under Sec.138 of Negotiable Instruments Act?"
</blockquote>
<p id="p_9">9.   Heard the arguments and perused the materials on record. On
that basis my finding on the above point is in the "Negative" for the
following;
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                   4                   C.C.No.50004/2016</span>


<p id="p_10">                           REASONS
</p><p id="p_11">10.   The complaint case in nutshell is that the accused is the family
friend of the complainant and approached the complainant for
financial assistance of Rs.10,00,000/- in the 1st week of Januray 2015
agreeing to repay the same within 3 months.          Accordingly the
complainant claims that on 10.01.2015 he has paid Rs.10,00,000/- in

the cheque amount.       The complainant claims that though the
accused has the knowledge of this notice failed to comply with the
notice. Hence, filed the complaint.
</p>

<p id="p_12">11.   The accused examined himself as D.W.1 in support of his
defense and also got marked documents at Ex.D.1 to 4. The accused
totally denied the complaint case.     The definite defense of the
accused is that the complainant was stranger to him and he came to
know about the complainant after this case. The accused claimed
that one Lakshmikanth who is the father-in-law of the complainant
was a financier and from whom he has borrowed Rs.10,000/-. The

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                   5                   C.C.No.50004/2016</span>


father of the complainant has received the signed blank cheques that
has been misused by the said Manjunath and filed this case through
the complainant. Accordingly prayed for dismissal of complaint.
</p>
<p id="p_13">12.   The complainant in support of his case examined himself as
P.W.1 and also got marked the documents at Ex.P.1 to 9. Ex.P.1 is
the cheque, Ex.P.2 is the Bank Return Memo, Ex.P.3 is the O/c of the
legal notice, Ex.P.4 is the returned postal cover, Ex.P.5 is the pay
slip, Ex.P.6 is the bank statement, Ex.P.7 &amp; 8 are the RTC extract and
Ex.P.9 is the genealogical tree. On the basis of these documents the
complainant claims that he has proved his case beyond reasonable
doubt. In this case the accused claimed that the cheque belongs to
him and also admitted the his signature in the cheque.       The said
cheque has been dishonoured for the want of funds in the bank
account of the accused, legal notice issued in time and the complaint
is also filed in time. The accused though claimed that he has issued
the cheque in connection with the chit fund transaction but the
issuance of cheque in favour of the complainant and the signature of
the accused in the cheque is not in dispute. Hence, certainly the
initial presumption under Sec.139 of N.I.Act can be drawn in favour
of the complainant.
</p>
<p id="p_14">13.   When the complainant made out a prima-facie case to draw the
initial presumption under Sec.139 of N.I.Act in favour of the
complainant, the burden shifts on the accused to prove the contrary
to the complaint case and also give a rebuttal evidence to the
complaint case.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                    6                    C.C.No.50004/2016</span>


<p id="p_15">14.   The accused taken a specific defense in the case is that there is
no transaction whatsoever between him and the complainant but he
has borrowed Rs.10,000/- from the father-in-law of the complainant
namely one Lakshmikanth and at that time Lakshmikanth has
received 3 signed blank cheques and signed promissory note and
consideration receipts from the accused. The accused also disputed
the service of notice as well as financial capacity of the complainant.
The accused further claims that after the repayment of said money
the said Lakshmikanth has returned one cheque and one promissory
note and not returned other cheques and promissory note and the
said Lakshmikanth by colluding with complainant has filed a false
case against the accused by misusing the earlier cheques. As the
accused has taken a specific defense, the burden shifts on him to
prove the said defense in the case.
</p>
<p id="p_16">15.   When the accused disputed the transaction between him and
the complainant as well as when the accused totally denied the
receiving of any money from the complainant and issuance of any
cheque in favour of the complainant, the burden shifts on the
complainant to prove that there was a transaction between him and
the accused and he has paid the amount to the accused as claimed
by him as well as issuance of Ex.P.1 cheque in his favour by the
accused.   The   complainant    has    not   placed   any   material   to
substantiate his claim of advancing the loan of Rs.10,00,000/- other
than the cheque. The only documents relied by the complainant in
order to prove his case is the 'cheque'.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                   7                    C.C.No.50004/2016</span>


<p id="p_17">16.   It is relevant to note that even according to the case of
complainant in the complaint the cheque has not at all issued when
the money has been paid to the accused. The complainant has made
out a specific case in complaint para No.4 is that after the lapse of 3
months when the accused failed to make the repayment of money,
he demanded the accused for repayment of money. As such, when
the complainant demanded for the repayment of money, this accused
has issued the Ex.P.1 cheque in favour of the complainant towards
the repayment of money. If the said claim is accepted, this accused
has issued the Ex.P.1 cheque in the month of April 2015. Admittedly,
the complainant claims that the money has been paid to the accused
as on 10.01.2015. Therefore, there were not even a scrap of paper
with the complainant till 12.04.2015 to show that he has paid the
huge sum of Rs.10,00,000/- to the accused on 10-01-2015.             No
prudent man will advance a huge sum of Rs.10,00,000/- without
obtaining any documents and that is even opposed to the natural
human conduct.
</p>
<p id="p_18">17.   It is also relevant to note that the financial capacity of the
complainant to advance the loan of Rs.10,00,000/- has been
seriously disputed. As already stated earlier, there is no material on
record to show that this complainant has paid the money to the
accused as on 10.01.2015.      Not even a scrap of paper has been
obtained from the accused by the complainant when the alleged
amount has been paid. At least the complainant must show that he
has the financial capacity to advance the money. The complainant
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                   8                    C.C.No.50004/2016</span>


during his evidence claimed that he was working at Toyoto Kirloskar
and his monthly salary was Rs.60,000/-. In order to substantiate the
said fact he has produced the pay slip for the month of January 2015
at Ex.P.15. The said document discloses that the gross salary of the
complainant was Rs.55,746.67 and net pay is Rs.45,896.67.          It is
relevant to note that the complainant claims that he has not at all
withdrawn any money from his bank account in order to make the
payment. The claim of the complainant that he used to withdraw a
portion of amount from his bank account since from the year 2000
and kept the same with him at his house in cash and he has paid the
said amount to the accused. The very claim of the complainant that
he used to withdraw the money from his salary account every month
and keep the same for almost 13 years without spending any money
is highly improbable thing that certainly creates suspicion.         No
prudent man will keep such a huge money with him at his house.
The natural human conduct of the person to get some profit or
benefit from his money. If at all this complainant had such a huge
money with him and he has kept the said money in his bank account
certainly that will fetch some interest to the complainant. Admittedly,
the accused claimed that he used to withdraw the money from the
year 2000. If at all the complainant has kept the money in his bank
account since the year 2010, certainly this complainant would have
received huge sum of interest from the 2000 for a period of 13 years.
</p>

<p id="p_19">18.   The complainant has also produced his bank statement at
Ex.P.6. The said statement is of ICICI Bank. The complainant has
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                   9                  C.C.No.50004/2016</span>


produced the bank statement from 01.01.2013 to 31.12.2014. The
entire bank statement at any point of time discloses that this
complainant has the bank balance more than Rs.10,00,000/-. Apart
from that the entries found on the various months also discloses that
this complainant used to receive the money to his bank account from
his salary and he used to withdraw almost entire net payment from
his bank account almost every month. If at all this complainant has
huge sum of money at his house and he need not required any
money for his domestic or family necessities, certainly he would not
have chosen to withdraw the entire net payment of his salary in so
many months.     It is relevant to note that the bank balance of
complainant as on 21.11.2014 is Rs.1,044/-.      Similarly, his bank
balance as on 19.06.2014 is only Rs.65.00.       Similarly, his bank
balance as on 03.11.2014 is Rs.42.74.       All these facts certainly
creates serious suspicion about the claim of the complainant that he
used to keep the money with him by withdrawing the same from his
bank account.
</p>

<p id="p_20">19.   It is also relevant to note that the accused produced one legal
notice issued by the complainant at Ex.D.1 that has been got marked
by the accused on confrontation with the complainant. As per said
notice, the complainant claimed that he has advanced a sum of
Rs.6,00,000/- to the accused as on 27.08.2014 by cash and for the
repayment of said amount this accused issued one cheque bearing
No.618535 and that has been bounced for want of funds in the bank
account of the accused.   The said fact has been suppressed by the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                  10                 C.C.No.50004/2016</span>


complainant in the complaint.         The case made out by the
complainant in this case is that this accused has borrowed a sum of
Rs.10,00,000/- on 10.01.2015.    This complainant during his cross-
examination claimed that after the notice at Ex.D.1 this accused has
repaid the amount of Rs.6,00,000/- to the complainant in the month
of December 2014 after the receipt of notice.    If it were so, the
accused has to pay the money to the complainant subsequent to
16.12.2014. According to the complaint averments in the 1st week of
January 2015, the accused approached the complainant for a loan of
Rs.10,00,000/-. If at all this accused was in need of Rs.10,00,000/-
in the 1st week of January 2015 certainly he would not have chosen
to repay the amount of Rs.6,00,000/- to the complainant instead he
would have asked the complainant to pay Rs.4,00,000/-. Therefore,
the very claim of the complainant that the accused has repaid
Rs.6,00,000/- in the last week of December 2014 and approached
the complainant for a hand loan of Rs.10,00,000/- in the 1st week of
January 2015, certainly creates serious doubt. Apart from that why
this complainant has suppressed the said facts in the complaint is
without any explanation.
</p>
<p id="p_21">20.   The definite case of the accused is that he has borrowed
Rs.10,000/- from one Lakshmikanth who is the father-in-law of the
complainant and issued 3 blank signed cheques and blank promissory
note while borrowing the said amount. The accused also claims that
when he has repaid the said amount to Lakshmikanth he has
returned 1 cheque at Ex.D.2 and promissory note at Ex.D.3. It is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                   11                   C.C.No.50004/2016</span>


relevant to note that the cheque issued in the name of Lakshmikanth
is an admitted fact. The date in the said Ex.D.2 cheque reveals that
it is dtd:08.12.2011.   The complainant claims that the transaction
under the Ex.D.2 is different from the transaction claimed in the
complaint. Whatever the contention regarding the amount and date,
the transaction between the accused and the Lakshmikanth is an
admitted fact in this case. The issuance of cheque in favour of the
Lakshmikanth is also an admitted fact.    The said fact also probablise
the defense of the accused.
</p>
<p id="p_22">21.   The complainant claims that the accused has borrowed the
money in order to purchase the site.      It is true that the accused
during his cross-examination admitted that he has purchased the site
for Rs.13,00,000/- and that has been sold by him for Rs.13,50,000/-.
The claim of the accused that he has paid only Rs.2,00,000/- and
could not arrange the balance amount hence, he has sold the said
site. It is relevant to note that when the said transaction has taken
place is without any explanation. If really this accused after receiving
Rs.10,00,000/- from the complainant has purchased the said site
certainly would not have sold the said site. It is relevant to note that
it is not the case of the complainant that the said site was with the
accused or he has subsequently sold the said site. In view of these
facts it has to be accepted that though the accused agreed to

to others.

<p id="p_23">22.   It is the specific case of the complainant that he has paid the
money to the accused on 10.01.2015 at 4.00 p.m.          The accused
disputed the said fact and claimed that he was on the night halt trip
duty in KSRTC. To substantiate the said fact he has produced the
certificate issued by the Depot Manager at Ex.D.4.           The said
document reveals that the accused has been entrusted with the night
halt trip duty. Absolutely there is no material on record to disbelieve
the said contention.
</p>
<p id="p_24">23.   It is relevant to note that the complainant has produced the
bank statement at Ex.P.6. As per said document this complainant
has presented one cheque for encashment on 27.03.2013 for
Rs.10,00,000/- and the said cheque has been dishonoured for the
reasons "Funds Insufficient".      Who has issued the said cheque to
the complainant is without any explanation.             Similarly, this
complainant has presented one cheque for Rs.6,00,000/- for
encashment as on 07.11.2014 and the cheque of the accused for
Rs.6,00,000/- on 03.12.2014. Therefore, in the month of November
and December 2014 this complainant has presented 2 cheques for
encashment through his bank account for Rs.6,00,000/- each and
who has issued these cheques is also without any explanation. If the
said entries found in the bank statement is accepted, certainly this
complainant ought to have paid money to others also other than the
accused. Admittedly, the complainant is a salaried person and he
used to withdraw all the money in a same month in which salary has
been credited to his bank account. When such is the case certainly it

cannot be accepted that the complainant has withdrawn money in
cash and kept the same in his house and that has been paid to the
accused as claimed by him cannot be accepted.
</p>
<p id="p_25">24.   It is the claim of the complainant that he has the income from
his property but what is the income from his family property or what
is the crop grown by them in their family property is without any
explanation.   It is true that the complainant has produced 2 RTC
extracts at Ex.P.7 and 8 and one property is measuring 3 Acre, 9
Guntas consists a Neelagiri and other property is shows that Finger
Millet (Raagi) has been grown by one Kenchamma in 16 guntas of
land and there is no information of the other crops. When such is
the case certainly it cannot be accepted that there were lucrative
income from the said property or the complainant is getting any
share in the said property.
</p>
<p id="p_26">25.   The accused also disputed the service of notice but that cannot
be accepted as the notice has been sent to the office address of the
accused. The accused also not disputed the said address. Hence,
certainly the claim of the accused that he has not received any notice
cannot be accepted. As already stated above, the complainant has
failed to prove that he had Rs.10,00,000/- with him as on 10.04.2015
and as well as there is no material on record to show that the
complainant has obtained any document for having been paid the
money to the accused as on 10.04.2015 certainly claim of the
complainant that he has paid the money to the accused cannot be
accepted. Apart from that the alleged cheque issued by the accused
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                                          14                      C.C.No.50004/2016</span>


claimed under the at Ex.D.1 notice has been bounced for want of
funds in the bank account of the accused in the month of December
2014 certainly it cannot be accepted that the complainant can
advance money without having any documents for having been paid
the money.        Apart from that story of the complainant that the
accused has repaid Rs.6,00,000/- subsequent to 16.12.2014 cannot
be accepted as this accused is a driver cum conductor in a KSRTC. If
at all this accused is a businessman certainly it would have been
accepted that he has arranged money for repayment of alleged
Rs.6,00,000/-. Hence, all these facts certainly probablise the defense
of the accused. When the defense of the accused looks probable,
certainly it has to be accepted that the complainant has failed to
prove her case beyond reasonable doubt. Accordingly I answer the
above point in "Negative". In the result, following;
