neither sustainable nor acceptable and has placed reliance upon

signatures in fake name as impostor was taken but were provided only

part of the amount and major amount grabbed by the main accused

conspired and their cases may be leniently considered and they were

not aware of the conspiracy. It has further been asserted that in their

properly put the questions as required to be took into consideration the

properly which has caused prejudice to the accused and has placed

</p>
<p id="p_104">        23. Learned counsel for the appellants Sohan Lal Jain

submitted that Secretary, Law Department is not proper authority to

grant prosecution sanction to prosecute the appellant, Sohan Lal Jain

as Officer in Revenue Department and hence sanction given by the

Law Department, is not valid as the Law Department was not

competent authority in that regard has relied upon decision reported

2012 (3) PLJR 424 and decision reported in 2006 (7) SCC page 170,

2005 (8) SCC 370 and submitted that prosecution sanction by proper

authority is sine qua non for prosecution.       It has further been

contended that appellants Sohan Lal Jain, Kalu Ram Rajak and

Kishori Lal Rajore on receipt of PPOs and relevant documents acted

honestly in discharge of their official duty and there is nothing to

indicate that they acted fraudulently in agreement or in conspiracy

with other accused or to have committed an offence and further there

is no evidence that they have derived economical benefit and whatever

they have done, they have done in discharge of their official duty and

hence there is no mens rea having been proved when they acted

bonafidely in discharge of their official duty, to pay pension as soon

as pension payment order received. It is also contended that there is

no sufficient compliance under <a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_21">Section 313</a> Cr.P.C.

</p><p id="p_105">          24. Learned counsel for the State however contended that

there are sufficient evidence in the prosecution evidence to show

implication of the appellants in the crime, both for their individual

participation itself indicates their indulgence in crime by forging false

documents as well as liable not only of conspiracy but also forging

documents. It is further submitted that it is true that there is no direct

evidence regarding agreement amongst the appellants for conspiracy

but offence of conspiracy can well be proved by inference draw by

taking into consideration the circumstantial evidence. The evidence

collected suggests act alleged to prove the offence and also creating

chain of circumstance indicating the guilt of the accused and evidence

is sufficient enough to draw inference to believe that appellants have

committed the offence exclusively any other hypothesis of their

innocence and has place reliance upon decision reported in 2011 (4)

PLJR 287. It has further been contended mere defect in drawing the

attention of accused on the part of evidence to the fact on which

prosecution relies and on the circumstance proved under <a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_22">Section 313</a>

Cr.P.C. by itself is no ground to reject the prosecution case, but the

accused must show that for non-compliance of the said provision

under <a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_23">Section 313</a> Cr.P.C., the prejudice has been caused to him and

mere omission does not vitiate the proceeding.        It is also open to

appellate court to call upon the counsel for the accused to show what

explanation the accused has as regards circumstances established

to explain and if accused is unable to offer the appellate court any

plausible or reasonable explanation of such circumstances, the court

may assume that such evidence or fact exists and that even if accused

had been questioned at the proper time in the trial court, he would not

have been able to furnish any good ground and has placed reliance

upon decision reported in 2011 SC page 1748 Satyavir Singh Rathi

Vs. State through C.B.I.
</p>
<p id="p_106">        25. Learned counsel for the State further contended that

prosecution has established the implication of the appellants in crime

and there is sufficient evidence of their implication to have acted in

crime in derogation of their duty and further, though, sanction has

been against two upper division clerks Kallu Ram Rajak and Kishori

Lal Rojore by competent authority and sanction against Sohan Lal

Jain by Law Secretary. So far argument that sanction for prosecution

has not been taken by proper authority and is defective and so

prosecution of Sohan Lal Jain is without sanction. However, it is

submitted that any error or irregularity in sanction for prosecution is

no ground. to reverse the finding of the sentence passed by the Special

Judge unless in the opinion of the court failure of justice shown to

have been occasioned and for the submission placed reliance on Sub-

Section 3, 4 of Section 19 of the <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_25">Prevention of Corruption Act</a> as well

as decision reported in AIR 2014 (SC) 1674.

</p><p id="p_108">        26. However, taking into consideration the respective

submission, I proceed to consider the point raised by the learned

counsel for the appellants. It has been asserted that against appellant,

Dinesh Kumar Sharma, there is no documentary evidence against him.

However, the case of the prosecution that Dinesh Kumar Kumar who

is kingpin of the entire episode and he is person who procure format

of the PPOs, forwarding letters and format of descriptive role and got

it printed. P.W. 8 has deposed that accused Dinesh Kumar Sharmahad

came to get the forms printed, though, has been declared hostile by

prosecution on the point P.W. 8 got the format printed the format from

his press. However, P.W. 7 is typist who claimed to have typed PPOs

and forwarding letters at the instruction of Dinesh Kumar Sharma and

has also deposed to the effect that Dinesh Kumar Sharma used to pay

him for the work for typing formats in PPOs which was used for

withdrawing the amount fraudulently.       P.W. 7 has also stated that

said PPOs were typed at the instruction of Dinesh Kumar Sharma and

Yugal Kishore Sinha and payment of the same was also provided by

both Dinesh Kumar Sharma and Yugal Kishore Sinha.          Hence from

the evidence of P.W. 7 that appellants Dinesh Kumar Sharma and

Yugal Kishore Sinha were main persons and on their direction said

PPOs were filled up with corresponding letters and descriptive rolls.

P.W. 6 is the Clerk/Peon, CDA, Allahabad. He has proved Exhibit

Exhibits 5 to 5/9, the copy from PPO register with red mark the PPO
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_32">                           33</span>




number which corresponds to the PPO number against which the

forged PPOs have been prepared to show that these PPOs‟ have been

issued in original in different name. From his evidence and Exhibit 5

to 5/9, it is apparent that the PPO number issued in forged name.

Further evidence of P.W. 40, it has come that Dinesh Kumar Sharma

was a Film Distributor and Yugal Kishore Sinha was his manager,

and has stated that Yugal Kishore Sinha has signed the descriptive

rolls as   Mr. R. S. Choudhary and has stated that the signature of

Army Officer in the name of R. S. Chaudhary on Exhibit 7 series has

been done by Yugal Kishore Sinha and has proved writing or

signature in the name of R. S. Chaudhary on descriptive roll, Exhibit-

7 series in the writing of Yugal Kishore Sinha. He has identified the

photographs of Virendra Kishore Singh and photograph of Vijay

Kumar Chaurasia which has been marked as Exhibits 4-4/1 which is

pasted on descriptive rolls marked as Exhibit 7-7/1. Hence from the

evidence of these witnesses, it is apparent that implication of Dinesh

Kumar Sharma and Yugal Kishore Sinha got the format printed and

false document prepared with forged signature with seal of the

Military Officer and forged signature. P.W. 5 is photographer, Madan

Mian and he has stated that Vijay Kumar Chaurasia and Virendra

Kishore Singh used to brought the persons whose photographs were

snapped by him and he prepared pair photographs by joining the

photograph of lady provided by Vijay Kumar Chaurasia             with
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_33">                           34</span>




photographs of persons snapped by him. The said photographs were

pested on the descriptive rolls filled by Yugal Kishore Sinha in forged

name and address giving forged seal and forged signature of the

Military persons in imaginary names, though, letters and descriptive

roles purported to have been issued from ASC Army Supply Crop,

Bangalore and Army Ordinance Crop, Secundrabad.

</p><p id="p_109">         27. P.W. 6 and 9 have come to prove the said PPOs, were

not issued from the Defence Pension Account Office, Allahabad and

were forged and seal on the said PPOs were also forged having not

been issued from the office.
</p>
<p id="p_110">          28. P.W. 15 and P.W. 36 are record officer from ASC

Centre, South ASC Record Army Supply Crop Secundrabad have

deposed that forwarding letters have not been issued by A.S.C. Centre,

South, Bangalore and ASC. Record Army Supply Crop, Secundrabad

and has stated that there is no Army Supply Crop, but there is Army

Service Record Office, Army Service, Bangalore and there is only

Army Service Core Record Supply and has stated that forwarding

letters and descriptive roles are forged and fabricated not issued from

ASC Centre, Bangalore or ASC Record Army Supply Crop,

Secundrabad. He has also deposed that the seal and signature on the

descriptive role and forwarding letters are also forged. Hence from

their evidence, it is apparent that PPOs, descriptive rolls and

forwarding letters are all forged and fabricated.     However, these
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_34">                           35</span>




forged letters were received in the Treasury Office, Sagar and

Treasury Office, Sagar, processed the forged PPOs.

</p><p id="p_111">         29. P.W. 18 is the Upper Division Clerk, Sagar Treasury

and he was treasurer in Sagar Treasury Office and from his evidence it

is apparent that forged PPOs, descriptive rolls and forwarding letters

processed by two Upper Division Clerk, Kallu Ram Rajak and Kishori

Lal Rahore and after processing those documents, the same was

placed before Treasury Office for verification of the PPOs to the

Treasury Officer, Sohan Lal Jain and he has stated in his evidence in

paragraph 98 that there was guideline for measuring for verifying the

genuineness of the PPOs sent to Additional Treasury Officer and has

submitted guidelines issued even prior to the occurrence and has

stated that before making payment of Military pensioner, there is

identification of the pensioner on the basis of signature and

photographs and for identification of pensioner reputed person who

known pensioner is required and the verification of pensioner after

taking guarantee but payment was made without proper verification

and guarantee by recognised ex-pensioner. He has further stated in

paragraph 102 that in the sanction Kallu Ram Rajak was dealing clerk

and Kishori Lal Rajore check genuineness of PPO and he has prepared

genuineness notes of PPOs was sent to Additional Treasury Officer

for verification of its genuineness. The Additional Treasury Officer

takes   guarantee for his satisfaction and takes signature of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_35">                            36</span>




guarantor and order for payment and then bills goes for calculation to

the dealing clerk then only payment order was made, bill is prepared

and bills goes to Dealing Clerk. The Dealing Clerk preparation of

cheque entered it into BTR register and BTR register is tally with by

another clerk and thereafter processing Account payee cheque.

</p><p id="p_112">      30. Exhibit 9 and 9/1 is the document notification which itself

mentioned that those documents are sent each year with specimen

signature of the person in whose signature PPO is issued to all the

Treasury Officer for their verification of the signature of those

authority who issues pension and the said document has sent by CDA

Office and document shown to have been issued in the December,

1992 for having been valid for the period January to December, 1993

in supersession of the earlier specimen signature sent previously.

Hence nature of this document, it is apparent that letters or notification

issued every year followed with signature of the authorities who

issued PPO for verification of their signatures, but the PPO‟s were

inspected without verification or comparing the signature by clerk and

Treasury Officer.    However, the investigation has been made as

appear from those documents that this type of letter issued each and

every year to be sent with specimen signature it was incumbent on the

on the official of Treasury office and the Upper Division Clerk to

compare the signature to verify the PPOs receipt with signature of the

Officer who issued the PPO, specimen copy or forwarding letter.

</p><p id="p_113">         31. However, submission of the learned counsel for the

appellants that no such letter with specimen signature was received is

not acceptable in view of Exhibit 9-9/1 proved by P.W.9 who has

proved memo dated 17. 12. 1992 with specimen signature which has

been marked as Exhibit-10 and has stated in paragraph 9 that Treasury

Officer is required to look into PPO before passing payment order,

copy with pension distributor officer and the Treasury Officer while

checking derogated the provision that pension was released on the

pension certified copy instead of PPO, and deposed that the seal on

the PPO is different from that use in it. It is further pointed out that

PPO did not bear any signature of authority in pen and ink which is

most glaring picture.

and cheques have been issued under fake names having been received

by the appellants with signature in change names for concealing their

identity and getting said cheques encashed by opening account in the

forged names concealing their identity and withdrawing the amount,

these evidences are taken together it is apparent that all the appellants

are guilty for forging documents.
</p>
<p id="p_124">          35. Hence from the act alleged, evidence adduced by the

prosecution it is manifest that all the appellants by their act of

commission and omission acted in manner contributing to achieve one

goal, though, their act may vary but indicating the achievement of

same goal indicate their agreement and the meeting of mind of all

appellants in doing illegal act and this illegal acts itself apparent have

form a chain of circumstance which has one and only conclusion
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_41">                            42</span>




indicating their agreement between them with only conclusion of their

guilt in total exclusion to any other theory of their having been

innocence. It is true that there is no direct evidence regarding meeting

of mind, but circumstance proved is sufficient enough to draw

inference that chain of circumstance have been proved beyond

reasonable doubt regarding implication of the appellants leaving any

doubt or any theory except their guilt and from the circumstance, it

can well be inferred that the act was done in agreement of the

appellants which has one goal.
</p>
<p id="p_125">         36. Taking into consideration the chain circumstances

proved that the format of PPO, descriptive roll printed. It was printed

by forged name, the seal on the document is forged, the signature on

document forged. The photograph pasted in forged name and forged

signature with changed identification signature made and then the

same got process to get the cheque issued and the cheque received by

impostors in changed name and was encahsed by opening account in

changed name, so it is apparent that each of the circumstances pointed

out has been established by cogent reliable and unimpeachable

evidence. Each circumstance points to the guilt of the accused. The

circumstance shows that the PPOs, descriptive rolls and forwarding

letters were forged by all the appellants in collusion and conspiracy in

agreement between the appellants except Kalu Ram Rajak, Kishori

Lal Rajore and Sohan Lal Jain who after process got the said forged
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_42">                           43</span>




PPOs, descriptive rolls procured successfully in collusion with other

appellants without properly verification and finally got cheque on the

basis of forged document in forged names, and giving their

identification approved, contributed in opening account in forged

names and U.D.C. Clerk, Kallu Ram Rajak and Sohan Lal Jain,

Treasury Officer got account open in their forged names with their

signatures in forged names and hence they have contributed in

committed forgery by opening account in forged name and on the

basis of forged document induced the Bank and Government to

withdraw amount to cheat to attract under <a href="/doc/556166/" id="a_26">Sections 468</a>, <a href="/doc/1466184/" id="a_27">471</a>, <a href="/doc/1436241/" id="a_28">420</a> and

<a href="/doc/1667388/" id="a_29">419</a> I.P.C. and further the chain of circumstance proved that chain of

circumstance points to the guilt of the accused leaving behind any

hypothesis of the innocence of the appellants.   The evidence against

Dinesh Kumar Sharma to he kingpin having got the forged document

filled by him and Yugal Kishore Sinha forged the PPO in the

imaginary name of Military Officer. It has well settled in decision

reported in 2011(4) PLJR (SC) 287 where it has been held that where

there is enough evidence to furnish reasonable ground to believe that

appellants have conspired together for committing offence relying

upon decision reported in 2011 PLJR (SC) page 287 and when

exception has been covered under <a href="/doc/1946503/" id="a_30">Section 10</a> of the Evidence Act.

</p><p id="p_126">       37. The learned counsel for the appellants submitted that the

agreement between the parties to do the offence is sine qua non for
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_43">                            44</span>




prosecution and the prosecution must prove that there was agreement

between the party and has relied upon the decision reported in 2008

(10) SCC 397 and 2007(3) SCC 334 for the said proposition.

However, it is true that agreement to commit offence is sine quo non

to prove conspiracy. However, it is matter of common experience and

well settle that the conspiracy is an act of privacy and secrecy and are

not hatched up in open. So direct evidences are seldom available and

it is not possible to give affirmative evidence.            Hence the

circumstances proved can be taken into consideration. In decision

relied upon by the learned counsel for the appellants reported in 2011

(4) PLJR (SC) 287 did take into consideration the decision reported in

2001 (1) SCC 378 Saju V State of Kerala held exception has been

carved out under <a href="/doc/1946503/" id="a_31">Section 10</a> of the Evidence Act in case of conspiracy

holding attract the applicability of <a href="/doc/1946503/" id="a_32">Section 10</a> i.e. action of one used

against other, the Court must have reasonable ground to believe that

two or more persons contributed together for committing offence.

The decision reported in 2011 (4) PLJR 287 take into consideration

the decision relied upon by the appellants reported in 2008 (10) SCC

397 and 2007(3) SCC 334 and hence there is no merit in the

submission. However, <a href="/doc/1031309/" id="a_33">Section 3</a> of the Evidence Act define proof as

the bundle of fact proved on the basis of which a logical conclusion

can be drawn about the guilt. From the evidence adduced, it can well

be inferred that the appellants in collusion forged the PPO, descriptive
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_44">                            45</span>




Roll and forwarding letter on the basis of which the accused in

Treasury office processed and issued cheque without properly

verification in defiance of rule identified them and cheque issued were

encashed by opening account in forged name established the offence

and on those evidence a logical conclusion can well be drawn. Hence

taking into consideration the evidence and circumstance, it is

established that     there is sufficient evidence that appellants

manufactured forged document by forged signature in forged names

and produced to withdraw the cheque on the basis of the those

documents and encahsed the cheque by opening account in forged

names, in the act the appellants play different role with one intention

to illegal gain to the appellants and illegal loss to State and hence can

well be concluded that appellants acted in agreement between them to

commit offence.

<p id="p_127">          38. Learned counsel for the appellants however contended

that the circumstances relied upon by the prosecution to prove charges

has not been properly asked, hence non-compliance of <a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_34">Section 313</a>

Cr.P.C. and has been asserted that accused was not given opportunity

to explain and so whole trial is vitiated as the appellants did not get

any chance to explain the circumstance and has relied upon decision

reported in 2011(2) (SCC) 206/ 2011, Cr. Law Journal 3931.

Though, objection has been raised at this stage that question under

<a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_35">Section 313</a> Cr.P.C. has not been properly asked and some of the

circumstances relied upon brought in evidence has not been put in

examination under <a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_36">Section 313</a> Cr.P.C. and hence that part be not

taken for consideration. From perusal of the lower court record it is

apparent that on behalf of accused persons no objection was raised at

the stage of examination in trial court. Further during argument also

no explanation has been given about the accused as regard

circumstance which has been established against them even when

during the argument nothing indicate as what prejudice has been

caused to them in the entire argument and they raise the issue for non-

examination of the accused, but even not provided any explanation as

to what prejudice has been caused to them and what explanation they

have in regard to those part of the evidence which was not brought to

their notice for explanation and the prejudice so caused to them. It is

relevant to quote part of a passage quoted reported in A.I.R. 1973 SC

pertinent to mention that facts and circumstances of the case the

paragraph 4 and 6........
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">         "4. We will first consider the argument, a stale argument
                        often heard, particularly in criminal courts,
                        that the opinion evidence of a handwriting
                        expert should not be acted upon without
                        substantial    corroboration.       We        shall
                        presently point out how the argument
                        cannot    be     justified   on   principle     or
                        precedent. We begin with the observation
                        that the expert is no accomplice. There is
                        no justification for condemning his opinion
                        evidence to the same class of evidence as
                        that of an accomplice and insist upon
                        corroboration.      True, it has occasionally
                        been said on very high authority that it
                        would be hazardous to base a conviction
                        solely on the opinion of a handwriting
                        expert.   But, the hazard in accepting the
                        opinion of any expert, handwriting expert or
                        any other kind of expert, is reliable
                        witnesses---the equality of credibility or
                        incredibility being one which an expert
                        shares with all other witnesses---- but
                        because all human judgment is fallible and
                        an expert may go wrong because of some
                        defect of observation, take of conclusion.
                        The more developed and the more perfect a
                        science, the less the chance of an incorrect
                        opinion and the converse if the science is
                        less developed and imperfect. The science
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_51">                52</span>




               of identification of finger prints has attained
               near perfection and the risk of an incorrect
               opinion is practically non-existent. On the
               other hand, the science of identification of
               handwriting is not nearly so perfect and the
               risk is, therefore, higher. But that is a far
               cry from doubting the opinion of a
               handwriting expert as an invariable rule and
               insisting upon substantial corroboration in
               every case, howsoever the opinion may be
               backed by the soundest of reasons. It is
               hardly fair to an expert to view his opinion
               with an initial suspicion and to treat him as
               an inferior sort of witness. His opinion has
               to be tested by the acceptability of the
               reasons given by him. An expert deposes
               and not decides. His duty is to furnish the
               judge    with    the   necessary     scientific
               conclusion, so as to enable the judge to
               form his own independent judgment by the
               application of these criteria to the facts
               proved in evidence.
</blockquote><p id="p_136">6. Expert testimony is made relevant by <a href="/doc/1025384/" id="a_39">Section 45</a> of the
               Evidence Act and where the Court has to
               form an opinion upon a point as to identity
               of handwriting, the opinion of a person
               „specially skilled‟ in questions as to identity
               of handwriting is expressly made a relevant
               fact. There is nothing in the <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_40">Evidence Act</a>,
               as for example like illustration (b) to

presume that an accomplice, is unworthy for
credit, unless he is corroborated in material
particulars, which justifies the court in
assuming    that   a    handwriting     expert‟s
opinion is unworthy of credit unless
corroborated. <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_42">The Evidence Act</a> itself (S.3)
tells up that „ a fact is said to be proved
when after considering the matters before it,
the Court either believes it to exist or
considers its existence so probable that a
prudent man ought, under the circumstances
of   the   particular   case,   to    act   upon
supposition that it exists‟. It is necessary to
occasionally remind ourselves of this
interpretation clause in the <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_43">Evidence Act</a>
lest we set an artificial standard of proof not
warranted by the provisions of the Act.
</p><p id="p_137">Further, under <a href="/doc/731516/" id="a_44">Section 114</a> of the Evidence
Act, the Court may presume the existence of
any fact which it thinks likely to have
happened, regard being had to the common
course of natural events, human conduct,
and public and private business, in their
relation to facts of the particular case. It is
also to be noticed that <a href="/doc/1458526/" id="a_45">Section 46</a> of the
Evidence Act makes facts, not otherwise
relevant, relevant if they support or are
inconsistent with the opinions of experts,
when such opinions are relevant.             So
corroboration may not invariably be insisted
upon before acting on the opinion of an
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_53">                            54</span>




                           handwriting expert and there need be no
                           initial suspicion. But on the facts of a
                           particular case, a court           may require
                           corroboration of varying degree. There can
                           be no hard and fast rule, but nothing will
                           justify the rejection of the opinion of an
                           expert supported by unchallenged reasons
                           on   the   sole   ground    that    it   is   not
                           corroborated.     The approach of a court
                           while dealing with the opinion of a hand
                           writing expert should be to proceed
                           cautiously, probe the reasons for the
                           opinion, consider all other relevant evidence
                           and decide finally to accept or reject it."
</p><p id="p_138">         45. Hence the decision reported and relied by the appellants

is not in term that expert opinion invariably cannot be relied unless

corroborated in material particular but it depends upon fact of the

case to insist on corroboration expert opinion or not. The expression

proof under <a href="/doc/1031309/" id="a_46">Section 3</a> of the Evidence Act is only to the extent if on

the evidence adduced a conclusion of the fact earn reasonably so

taken if can be sent to have been proved.
</p>
<p id="p_139">         46. However, taking into consideration the fact that

identification of the appellants are on the basis of their identification

by photographer P.W. 5 who have stated that he snapped photographs

of the appellants has proved photographs of the persons to whom he

snapped and signatures of these appellants on the question document
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_54">                            55</span>




which has been forged in their false names and the specimen signature

tally with signatures on those documents in their false names as stated

above signed at different stage as in descriptive roll, PPO Register,

BTR Register, Account opening form and other documents in bank

etc. and hence identification of the appellants can well be said to have

been proved to have been identified.         The identification of the

photographs, Exhibit- 4 series by P.W. 5 and their specimen

signatures having tallied with the signatures on the said document and

corresponding signatures on PPO Register, BTR Register and

Accounting Opening Form for which cheque issued, a logical

conclusion can well be drawn for the implication on the logical basis

to prove the guilt and the participation in crime.

</p><p id="p_140">         47.    The next question raised that prosecution sanction

against Sohan Lal Jain has not been proved by proper authority as the

Law Department is not proper authority to give prosecution sanction

and has been placed reliance on decision reported in 2012(3) PLJR,

424, the decision of this Hon‟ble Court in which it has been held that

sanction issued by the Law Department with respect to person was an

employee of the Social Welfare Department and since sanction is not

by departmental who is appropriate authority sanction is not valid as

the Law Department was not competent authority in that regard. It has

further been contended that grant of proper sanction by competent

authority is sine qua non for taking cognizance and reliance placed on
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_55">                            56</span>




decision reported in 2006 (7) SCC 172 and 2005 (8) SCC 370.

</p><p id="p_141">         48.    However, learned counsel for the State relied upon

decision reported in 2014 AIR (SC) 1674 where it has been held that

when sanction for prosecution granted by the Law Department of the

State and not by parent department even then assuming              Law

Department was not competent and sanction order invalid, even then

criminal trial and the judgment, order and conviction is not vitiated in

view of provision contained in sub-section 3 and 4 of Section 19 of

<a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_47">PC Act</a> and <a href="/doc/338903/" id="a_48">Section 465</a> of Cr.P.C. where it has been held that until

prejudice has been shown to have caused to the appellants, order

passed by the Special Judge shall        not be reversed or altered.

Reliance has been placed upon decision reported in 2014 (SC 1674).

Reliance has also been paced on the decision reported in 2006(7) SCC

page 172 where it has been held the sanction for prosecution granted

by a person not authorised by law is without jurisdiction would be a

nullity when there is nothing to show he was delegated with the power

of sanction, the power to grant of sanction was vitiated in law.

However, from the said decision it is proper to quote paragraph 20

and 21 where it has been taken into consideration and held that;

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_7">               " 20. The courts are obliged to go into the question
                     of prejudice of the accused when the main
                     investigation is concluded without a valid
                     sanction.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_8">                  21. It is true that only on the basis of the illegal
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_56">                               57</span>




                     investigation a proceeding may not be quashed
                     unless miscarriage of justice is shown and
                     upheld that noticed that respondent had
                     suffered      miscarriage   of   justice    as   the
                     investigation made as the investigation was not
                     fair."</blockquote><p id="p_142">
</p><p id="p_143">          49. Hence decision relied upon by the learned counsel for

the appellants also take notice of the fact that question of prejudice is

required to be looked into while considering the quashing of

prosecution on the ground of sanction not granted by authorised

person.
</p>
<p id="p_144">           50. The decision reported in 2014 (SC) page 1674 and

decision reported in 2009 (15) page 533 decision reported in 2006

PLJR SC. 73 hold that order of conviction and sentence cannot be

quashed merely on the ground that sanction has not been properly

taken but the question required to be taken into consideration whether

it has caused prejudice to the accused persons.              However the

appellants have not shown that prejudice has been caused.

</p><p id="p_145">            51. However, learned counsel for the appellants submitted

that had the department considered the sanction may in its wisdom

had exonerated and may not have granted sanction. However, the

submission made is only on supposition, though, in same matter the

Joint Secretary lent the sanction for prosecution granted.

</p><p id="p_146">           52. The learned counsel for the appellant Sohan Lal Jain,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_57">                            58</span>




Kallu Ram Rajak and Kishori Lal Rajori submitted that the these

appellants did whatever has been done in discharge of official duty

and there is no evidence either they were in agreement with the other

accused nor there is any evidence that they did any act to constitute a

crime. The signing on the PPOs and processing the PPOs, forwarding

letter and descriptive roll were part of their official duty. They had

only to verify whether the signature made on the descriptive roll were

the signature of the person whose pair photographs was pasted on it.

Since the photograph of the appellants on descriptive roll tallied with

the person present for verification of whose signatures were verified

after taking their signature in PPO Register and BTR Register. Since

the name mentioned in the descriptive roll having their photograph

and signature on it then their photograph and signature tallied with

the person present and his signature in changed name verified and so it

was ordered to prepare bill and issue cheque. Hence there is no

evidence either of committing any crime nor to have this appellant in

agreement with other accused persons.
</p>
<p id="p_147">        53. The learned counsel for Kishori lal Rajori submits that

his duty was to issue cheque after order passed by Treasury Officer

verifying the person to issue cheque to person in whose name PPOs

received ordered by Treasury Officer after verification of the signature

of appellant on descriptive roll.   It has further been contended that

P.W.6 in his evidence has stated that all the 20 PPOs have been issued
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_58">                            59</span>




from his office and the PPOs of these number has mechanically been

prepared from CDA office. Hence submitted that when PPOs were

issued by CDA office then if the same processed in Sagar Treasury,

there is nothing wrong that authority issued cheque on the basis of

forged PPO sent by CDA office. It is further submitted in paragraph

24 of evidence of P.W. 14, it is stated that the letter dated 08. 12. 1993

marked Y has been shown for the first time was sent from CDA,

Allahabad to Sagar Treasury by which T.O. was asked to take

precaution and the said letter is of a subsequent date to the date of

occurrence.
</p>
<p id="p_148">       54. However, the submission made by the learned counsel is

without on merit. The submissions made are in two parts. Firstly, the

work was done in discharge of official duty and they verified only the

sign with the photograph of person whose photograph pasted on it and

if the appellant had his photograph in change name and signature

made in changed name it could not be ascertain they are not at fault.

However, the argument made appear to be lucrative and acceptable in

its first instance. But going into the document, it is apparent that

photographs pasted on the descriptive roll Exhibit- 4 series of all the

appellants are apparently appears to have been photograph by joining

the two photograph and on face of it appears to be objectionable and

require to have been objected at the time of verification and proper

strict verification required to be held. The PPOs received were not
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_59">                             60</span>




signed in pen and only seal of signature was not objected. The PPO

received in the name of person was required to have been identified by

a pensioner who is well known to the person in whose name PPO was

issued but the same was not observed while verifying the

identification.      The PPOs apparently signed in seal without any

signature of any authority in pen and ink. The cheques were ordered

to be issued in heavy haste without proper verification and proper

identification and verifying the signature of the authority require to

issue the PPOs.
</p>
<p id="p_149">         55.      The name of office from which descriptive roll and

forwarding letter issued as Army Supply Corps, Bangalore, but no

Crops like Army Supply Corps, Bangalore, but it is Army Service

Corp Supply and various inherent infirmity in the two forged

documents were overlooked at the time of verification of the

documents. The P.W.9 has specifically has deposed that the Treasury

office require to see the format of PPOs and see whether signed in pen

and ink by the authorities and Treasury Officer has overlooked the

inherent infirmities focused in it. The payment was made on the basis

of Pension Certificate Copy instead of Pension Disbursing Officer

(PDO) copy instead of signature in pen it is only signature in stamp

pad. The seal are different. The expenses of pension payment civil

estimate require to be deleted, where as it shown as service estimate

and the Pension Payment Officer has not mentioned the proof of his
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_60">                            61</span>




identification before person who is well known. He has prove the

notification dated 17.12.1992 marked as Exhibit-9 the specimen

signature of the authority issuing PPOs for verification of the

signature marked as Exhibit 9/1, but the signature was never verified

and further from perusal of the descriptive roll and the payment, it is

apparent that said PPO and related document processed in heavy haste

in some case within a day or within a couple of days. Hence from the

evidence, it is apparent that while processing the PPO, the Upper

Division Clerk and Treasury Officer ignored to observe the document

properly. It is true there is no direct evidence of agreement to do

illegal act, but the manner in which the duties ignored a reasonable

conclusion be drawn regarding their implication in permeating their

laches to the success of the end design to be in agreement with the

other accused persons. However, the submission that paragraph 3 of

P.W.6 that the PPO issued from CDA Office, Allahabad, is only

reading a line in evidence in isolation. The P.W. 6 itself has stated in

his evidence in same paragraph that 26 PPOs were forged. He is

Accountant in CDA Office and has stated that he has not sent these 20

forged PPOs. He has further stated that he did not enquire that these

PPOs were dispatched from Dispatch Section, there is no infirmity in

Dispatch Section of CDA and further P.W.9 is the Upper Division

Clerk of CDA Office, Allahabad, has stated that these 20 PPOs are

forged which have not been issued from his office and it requires to be
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_61">                            62</span>




signed in pen and ink by Issuing Officer and hence the submission that

the PPOs issued from PPO Office is devoid of any merit.

</p><p id="p_150">         56.    It is true that there is no direct evidence of conspiracy

but going to the act and infirmities found in the PPO, descriptive roll

on face of it was processed without objection and process adopted in

verification of signature and photograph attached verified in heavy

haste giving the certificate of identification promoting them in their

illegal act ignoring the inherent defect in PPOs, Descriptive roll that a

reasonable conclusion be drawn of their agreement and nexus in

crime. There is no doubt about the lapse on the part of the authorities

in their duty for identification that requires to be identification by

person who is known to them since long has also been ignored. This

indicates nexus between the prime accused and the Treasury Officer

and their Upper Division Clerk. The requirement to proof for criminal

charge is proof beyond reasonable doubt and the mens rea. It is

submitted that lapse on the part of accused Sohan Lal Jain, Kishori Lal

Rajori and Kallu Ram Rajak is only lapse on their part not properly

scanning the same which can be a dereliction of duty.         However, if

the entire fact taken into consideration is one whole that manner in

which PPOs processed indicates the hands of Sohan Lal Jain, Kishori

Lal Rajori and Kallu Ram Rajak in agreement with other accused in

verifying the identity of the appellants in fake names and opening the

account on the basis of identification by Treasury Officer.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_62">                                              63</span>




</p><p id="p_151">                           57. However, from the entire evidence there is nothing has

                  been shown that appellants have got any prejudice in the matter.

                  Taking into consideration the entire evidence nothing has been

                  brought to the notice of the Court that what prejudice has been caused

                  to the appellants for irregularities in obtain sanction and prejudice for

                  defect in recording statement under <a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_49">Section 313</a> Cr.P.C.

</p><p id="p_152">                           58 . Hence I do not find any reason to interfere with the

                  impugned judgment of conviction and sentence in appeals. Hence all

                  the appeals are dismissed.
