ACT:
     <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_1">Indian Limitation	Act</a>, 1908,<a href="/doc/1720337/" id="a_2"> s. 15</a>, whether attachment
of decree  amounts to 'stay' within the meaning of-Execution
application  struck   off-Another  application	 on   decree
becoming executable, if continuation of the previous one.



HEADNOTE:
     The respondent  obtained  a  money-decree	against	 the
appellant, from	 the Subordinate judge, Gauhati, and applied
for its	 execution. The	 appellant applied for an adjustment
of  the	  decree,  and	 the  respondent's  application	 for
execution was  dismissed.  The	appellant  then	 obtained  a
decree from  the Subordinate  Judge,  Nowgong,	against	 the
respondent, and	 in its	 execution, got	 his Gauhati  decree
attached.  The	 appellant  then  withdrew  his	 adjustment-
application.
     The High  Court allowed  the  respondent's	 appeal	 for
execution of  the Gauhati  decree.  The	 Subordinate  Judge,
Gauhati, struck	 off his original execution application from
the file.  Thereafter, the  attachment order  ceased  to  be
operative on  account of  the High  Court's allowance of the
respondent's  appeal   in  the	 Nowgong  matter,   and	 the
respondent  again  applied  for	 execution  of	the  Gauhati
decree, but  the Subordinate  Judge, Gauhati,  dismissed the
application as	time-barred.  The  High	 Court	allowed	 his
appeal and  directed the execution to proceed. The appellant
contended  before   this  Court	  that	attachment   of	 the
respondent's decree  did not  amount to	 a 'stay' within the
meaning	 of  <a href="/doc/1720337/" id="a_3"> S.  15</a>  of  the  Indian  Limitation  Act,	 and
therefore, his	second application  for execution was barred
by limitation,	not having  been filed within three years of
the first  one being  struck off  by the  Subordinate Judge,
Gauhati.
     Dismissing the appeal, the Court
^
     HELD: (1) The order obtained by the appellant attaching
the decree  of the  respondent precluded the respondent from
executing the  decree during  the time the attachment was in
force. There  was no  question	of  limitation	because	 the
application was	 filed within  three years  from  28  April,
1964, when  the bar  against execution	was raised  and	 the
attachment order ceased to be operative. [627B-C]
     (2) The  order striking  off the  execution application
was mere  consigning it	 to the	 record-room for statistical
purposes. The  application for execution on 27th July, 1965,
is a continuation of the old application. [627D-E]



JUDGMENT:
</pre><p id="p_1">     CIVIL APPELLATE  JURISDICTION: Civil  Appeal No. 858 of
1968.
</p><p id="p_2">     From the  Judgment and Decree dated 7-7-67 of the Assam
and Nagaland  High Court  at Gauhati in Misc. Appeal Nos. 36
and 37 of 1966.
</p><p id="p_3">     Sarjoo Prasad and A. K. Nag for the appellant.
     B. P. Maheshwari for the respondent.
</p><p id="p_4">     The Judgment of the Court was delivered by
     RAY, C.J.	This appeal by certificate is from the order
dated 26 July, 1967 of the High Court of Assam.
</p><p id="p_5">     The  only	question  in  this  appeal  is	whether	 the
respondent's  application   filed  on	27  July,  1965	 for
execution of  the  decree  obtained  by	 him  is  barred  by
limitation.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">626</span>
<p id="p_6">     The respondent  on 7  January, 1952  obtained a  decree
against the  appellant for  the sum of Rs. 71,980 in a money
suit filed  in the Court of Subordinate Judge, Gauhati. On 8
December,  1956	  the  respondent   decree-holder  filed  an
application No.	 89/56 for  executing the said decree. On 15
July, 1957  the appellant,  the judgment  debtor,  filed  an
application pleading  adjustment of the decree. On 15 April,
1958 the  judgment debtor  withdrew the said application. On
18 December,  1957 the	Subordinate Judge  Gauhati dismissed
the decree-holder's application No. 89/56. The decree-holder
preferred an  appeal. The  High Court  at Gauhati on 1 July,
1959 set  aside the  order  of	the  Subordinate  Judge	 and
allowed the appeal for execution of the decree.
</p><p id="p_7">     Meanwhile on  18 January,	1958 the  appellant judgment
debtor in  the Gauhati	suit obtained  a decree	 against the
respondent for	the sum	 of Rs. 1,22,000 in the Court of the
Subordinate Judge  at Nowgong. In execution of the decree in
the Nowgong  suit the appellant on or about 29 January, 1958
obtained an  attachment of the respondent's decree passed in
the Gauhati suit.
</p><p id="p_8">     On 13  August,  1959  the	Subordinate  Judge,  Gauhati
struck off  the execution  application No.  89/56  from	 the
file.
</p><p id="p_9">     The respondent  filed  an	appeal	against	 the  decree
obtained by  the appellant  in the  Nowgong suit.  The	High
Court on  28 April  1964 accepted  the appeal  filed by	 the
respondent and	dismissed the  Nowgong	suit  filed  by	 the
appellant.
</p><p id="p_10">     On 27  July, 1965	the respondent	filed an application
for  execution	in  the	 Court	of  the	 Subordinate  Judge,
Gauhati. The  appellant preferred  an  objection  contending
that the  application is  barred by  limitation. On 4 March,
1966  the   Subordinate	 Judge	 dismissed   the   execution
application as barred by time.
</p><p id="p_11">     On 26  July, 1967	the High  Court accepted  the appeal
filed by  the  respondent  and	directed  the  execution  to
proceed.
</p><p id="p_12">     The contention  of the  appellant	is  that  the  order
obtained by  the appellant attaching the respondent's decree
did not amount to a stay within the meaning of <a href="/doc/1720337/" id="a_4">section 15</a> of
the  Indian   Limitation  Act,	 1908,	and  therefore,	 the
respondent's application for execution which was filed on 27
July, 1965 was barred by limitation. The appellant contended
that when  the Subordinate Judge, Gauhati on 13 August, 1959
struck off  the execution  application of the respondent the
respondent should  have filed  an application  for execution
within three years from that date.
</p><p id="p_13">     The High  Court referred to the order dated 29 January,
1958 passed  by	 the  Nowgong  Court  attaching	 the  decree
obtained by  the respondent.  The High	Court relied  on the
provisions contained in Order 21 Rule 53 (1) (b) of the Code
of Civil  Procedure and	 held that  the attachment continued
restraining the	 respondent from  executing the decree until
the notice  issued by  the Court  attaching the	 decree	 was
recalled. The Nowgong court did not pass any order recalling
the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">627</span>
order. On  1 March,  1958 the  Nowgong court passed an order
which was as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">	  "Notice  served.  No	objection  filed  by  J.  D.
     (meaning thereby  judgment debtor). Heard both parties.
     Execution	case   is  struck   off	 for   the  present.
     Attachment to continue until further orders."</blockquote>
<p id="p_14">     In the  context of	 this order  of attachment passed by
the Nowgong court the attachment continued until the Nowgong
suit was  dismissed by the High Court on 28 April, 1964. The
High Court  rightly held  that	there  was  no	question  of
limitation because  the application  was filed	within three
years from 28 April, 1964 when the bar against execution was
raised and  the	 order	restraining  the  respondent  decree
holder from  executing the decree in the Gauhati suit ceased
to be operative.
</p><p id="p_15">     Another  contention   which  had  been  raised  by	 the
appellant and  repeated here  is that when the Gauhati court
on 13  August, 1959  struck off the execution case No. 89/56
the execution  application filed on 27 July, 1965 was barred
by time.  The High  Court held	that the Gauhati Court on 13
August, 1959  merely struck  off the  execution application,
and, therefore,	 the subsequent	 application which  was made
was a  continuation of	the execution  proceedings. The High
Court held  that striking off the application did not amount
to any order deciding the merits of the application.
</p><p id="p_16">     The order	obtained  by  the  appellant  attaching	 the
decree of  the respondent  in  the  Gauhati  suit  has	been
rightly held  by  the  High  Court  to	have  precluded	 the
respondent from	 executing the	decree during  the time	 the
attachment was	in force.  The other  conclusion of the High
Court that the execution application dated 27 July, 1965 was
a continuation	of the	earlier application is also correct.
The order  striking off	 the execution	application has been
rightly construed by the High Court as merely consigning the
application to the Record Room for statistical purposes. The
application dated 27 July, 1965 indicates in column 2 as the
respondent rightly  stated that the previous application for
execution was  struck off  on 13 August, 1959 because of the
order  of  attachment  passed  by  the	Nowgong	 court.	 The
attachment order  was nullified	 only when  the	 appellant's
suit was  dismissed by the High Court on 28 April, 1964. The
respondent's decree  became executable	at  that  time.	 The
inescapable conclusion is that the application for execution
on 27 July, 1965 is a continuation of the old application.
</p><p id="p_17">     For these	reasons, the  judgment of  the High Court is
affirmed. The appeal is dismissed with costs.
</p><pre id="pre_2">M.R.					   Appeal dismissed.
