THE HONBLE SRI JUSTICE A.V.SESHA SAI       

C.R.P.No.1153 of 2017 
O R D E R: 
</pre>
<p id="p_1">        Defendants in O.S.No.99 of 2011, on the file of the Court of the
learned Senior Civil Judge, Penukonda, Anantapur District, are the petitioners
in the present revision filed under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_1">Article 227</a> of the Constitution of India.
This revision calls in question order dated 21.12.2016 passed by the said
Court in I.A.No.447 of 2016.
</p><p id="p_2">2.      The respondent herein instituted the above mentioned suit against the
petitioners herein for cancellation of a Gift Deed dated 05.11.1998 executed
by the plaintiff in respect of the plaint schedule property in favour of the
defendants and for a decree for Rs.25,000/- towards compensation apart
from costs.
</p><p id="p_3">3.      The defendants/petitioners herein filed a written statement in the
month of November, 2011 denying the plaint pleadings while praying for
dismissal of the suit.  After the closure of the evidence on behalf of the
plaintiffs, the defendants/petitioners herein filed I.A.No.447 of 2016 under
the provisions of Order VIII Rule 1A(3) r/w Section 151 of the Code of Civil
Procedure praying the Court below to receive the documents enclosed to the
said application by condoning the delay in filing the same.
</p><p id="p_4">4.      The plaintiff/respondent herein resisted the said application by way of
filing counter.  The learned Senior Civil Judge, Penukonda, by way of the
order under challenge, dismissed the said application. This revision assails
the validity and the legal sustainability of the said order passed by the
learned Senior Civil Judge.
</p><p id="p_5">5.      Heard Sri Aravala Rama Rao, learned Standing Cousnel for the A.P.
State Road Transport Corporation for the petitioners and Sri A.Hanumantha
Reddy for the respondent apart from perusing the material available before
the Court.
</p><p id="p_6">6.      It is contended by the learned Standing Counsel for the petitioners
State Road Transport Corporation that the questioned order is highly
erroneous, contrary to law and is opposed to the very spirit and object of the
provisions of Order VIII Rule 1 (3) of the Code of Civil Procedure.  It is
further submitted by the learned counsel for the petitioners that the
documents proposed to be filed before the Court below are very crucial and
would be highly helpful for the Court to come to a just and reasonable
conclusion.  It is further submitted that on the ground of mere delay the
petitioners herein cannot be non-suited and the Court below grossly erred in
not considering the categoric averments of the petitioners in the affidavit
filed in support of the application that the documents could be traced out
recently.  It is further argued by the learned counsel that in the event of the
present application being allowed, the same would not cause any prejudice to
the respondent herein.  According to the learned counsel for the petitioners
the reasons assigned by the learned Judge are neither sustainable nor
tenable in the eye of law.
</p><p id="p_7">7.      To bolster his submissions and contentions, the learned Standing
Counsel for the petitioners places reliance on the judgment of the Honble
Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/1126109/" id="a_2">K.K.VELUSAMY v. N.PALANISAMY</a>  and the judgments        
of this Court in <a href="/doc/74630600/" id="a_3">GPR HOUSING PRIVATE LIMITED v. C.PRITHVI RAJ     
REDDY</a> , <a href="/doc/1139486/" id="a_4">DASUPUTRUNI SURYANARAYANA v. DASUPUTRUNI               
ADINARAYANA AND OTHERS</a>  and JOHN SANTIYAGO v. CLEMENT               
DASS AND OTHERS .     
</p><p id="p_8">8.      On the contrary, the learned counsel for the plaintiff/respondent
herein contends that there is no illegality nor there is any jurisdictional error
in the impugned order and in the absence of the same the order passed by
the learned Senior Civil Judge is not amenable for any judicial review under
<a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_5">Article 227</a> of the Constitution of India.  According to the learned counsel,
the defendants in the affidavit filed in support of the present application in
the Court below did not assign any valid and proper reasons for not filing the
proposed documents along with the written statement.  It is further
submitted that the proposed documents are not relevant for adjudication in
the present case.
</p><p id="p_9">9.      In support of his submissions and contentions, learned counsel for the
respondent takes the support of the judgments of this Court in  RAVI
SATISH v. EDALA DURGA PRASAD  and VORUGANTI NARAYANA              
RAO v. BODLA RAMMURTHY AND OTHERS .          
</p><p id="p_10">10.     In the above backdrop, now the point that arises for consideration of
this Court is_Whether the order passed by the learned Senior Civil Judge is in
accordance with the provisions of Order VIII Rule 1A (3) of the Code of Civil
Procedure or whether the same requires any correction by this Court under
<a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_6">Article 227</a> of the Constitution of India?
</p><p id="p_11">11.     There is absolutely no controversy on the reality that the respondent
herein instituted the present suit as long back as on 18.04.2011 and the
defendants/petitioners herein filed a written statement in the month of
November, 2011.  It is pleaded in the plaint categorically that recently just
before issuance of notice dated 18.04.2010, the APSRTC put up a notice in
the plaint schedule property  and in the bus station  at Puttaparthy inviting
persons to take the building in the plaint schedule property on lease for
running a school or a college or any office.  The sum and substance of the
case of the plaintiff is that the said action on the part of the Road Transport
Corporation is contrary to the recitals in the Gift Deed.
</p><p id="p_12">12.     In the affidavit filed in support of the present I.A.No.447 of 2016 the
defendants stated that at the material time of filing counter and chief
examination affidavit, some of the important documents could not be filed
and the same are very essential and crucial to prove the case of the
defendants and the said documents could be recently traced out.  While
stating so, the defendants/petitioners herein prayed the Court below to
condone the delay in receiving the said documents.  Admittedly, in the
present suit, recording of evidence on behalf of the plaintiffs came to an end.
Except stating that at the time of filing counter and chief examination
affidavits the documents could not be filed and they could be traced recently,
no other reason is forthcoming nor did the petitioners state clearly the
reasons for not filing the said documents along with the written statement.
If the reason as stated in the present affidavit is treated as a reasonable one,
the same can be a reason in each and every case.  In the considered opinion
of this Court, the said reason assigned by the petitioners herein, by any
stretch of imagination, cannot be said to be a valid reason.  The petitioners
herein even did not state in the affidavit that despite their due diligence, the
proposed documents could not be traced out at the relevant point of time.
</p><p id="p_13">13.     Coming to the judgments cited by the learned Standing Counsel for
the petitioners Corporation_ in the case of K.K.VELUSAMY (supra 1) , the
Honble Apex Court while dealing with the scope of Order 18 Rule 17 and the
power of Court under Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure,
categorically held that the power under Section 151 or Order 18 Rule 17 of
the Code of Civil Procedure are not intended to be used routinely, merely for
the asking and if so used it will defeat the very purpose of various
amendments to the code to expedite trials.  The Honble Apex Court further
ruled that where the application is found to be bona fide and where the
additional evidence, oral or documentary, will assist the Court to clarify the
evidence on the issues and will assist in rendering justice and the Court is
satisfied that non-production earlier was for valid and sufficient reasons, the
Court may exercise its discretion to recall the witnesses or permit the fresh
evidence.  The Honble Supreme Court further held that if the party had an
opportunity to produce such evidence earlier but did not do so or if the
evidence already led is clear and unambiguous, or if it comes to the
conclusion that the object of the application is merely to protract the
proceedings, the court should reject the application. In the instant case, it is
very much evident from a reading of the affidavit filed in support of the
application that the petitioners herein utterly failed in laying any foundation
to show that despite due diligence the proposed documents could not be
produced earlier.  Therefore, the above judgment would not render any
assistance to the petitioners herein.
</p><p id="p_14">14.     In the case of GPR HOUSING PRIVATE LIMITED (supra 2), this    
Court at paragraph 11 held that mere delay in filing the application would
not constitute the sole ground for rejecting the leave.  In the instant case, it
is not the mere delay which prompted the Court below to dismiss the
application and on the other hand, the Court below dismissed the application
on other aspects which are germane for consideration of the application.
</p><p id="p_15">15.     In the case of DASUPUTRUNI SURYANARAYANA (supra 3), this       
Court held that the question as to whether a particular document is sale
agreement or possessory agreement cannot be gone into at that stage. 
Absolutely there cannot be any dispute with regard to the legal position and
in fact the said judgment also would not render any assistance to the
petitioners herein.
</p><p id="p_16">16.     In JOHN SANTIYAGO (supra 4),  this Court held that mere absence  
of plea with a specific reference  to a document is not fatal to the case.
Having regard to these circumstances and in the absence of any due diligence
on the part of the petitioners the principle laid down in the said judgment
cannot be pressed into service.  In the said judgment this Court also dealt
with the aspect of delay.
</p><p id="p_17">17.     Coming to the judgments cited by the learned counsel for the
respondents in the case of RAVI SATISH (supra 5), this Court while dealing
with the provisions of Order VIII Rule 1-A (3) of the Code of Civil Procedure,
ruled that grant of leave under this provision of law cannot be for a mere
asking nor the Court is a mere post-office to receive documents even in the
absence of any reasons being furnished for failure to file the said documents
along with the written statement.  This Court further held that having chosen
not to give any reasons, it is not open to the petitioners therein to contend
that the Court below should have received the documents, since the
petitioners right could be adversely affected for failure on its part to receive
the documents.  This Court also took note of the aspect that admissibility
and proof of documents are matters which ought not to be gone into at the
time of receipt of documents.  This Court further held that the leave sought
for can only be granted on adequate reasons being furnished justifying failure
on the part of the applicant in not filing the documents along with the
written statement earlier.  This Court also repelled the contention that no
prejudice would be caused to the other side.
</p><p id="p_18">18.     In the case of VORUGANTI NARAYANA RAO (supra 6), this Court     
while noting the object behind the amendments made to the Code of Civil
Procedure by virtue of Act 46 of 1999 with effect from 01.07.2002
categorically found that unless the reasons assigned by the defendant
disclose sufficient cause for his failure to produce the documents within the
time stipulated in Rule 1-A of Order VIII C.P.C., the Court shall not permit
the defendants later.   This Court also observed in the said case with regard
to the absence of any pleadings that despite due diligence the documents
could not be traced out and that the defendants did not state as to when the
documents were traced out. 
</p><p id="p_19">19.     The principles laid down in the judgments cited by the learned counsel
for the respondents are squarely applicable to the facts and circumstances of
the case.   It is also settled principle of law that unless the order impugned
suffers from jurisdictional error or patent perversity, the power of judicial
review under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_7">Article 227</a> of the Constitution of India cannot be pressed into
service.   Therefore, this Court has absolutely no scintilla of hesitation nor
any shadow of doubt to hold that the order under challenge does not
warrant any interference by this Court under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_8">Article 227</a> of the Constitution
of India.
</p><p id="p_20">20.     For the aforesaid reasons, the revision is dismissed.   As a sequel, the
miscellaneous petitions, if any, shall stand closed. There shall be no order as
to costs.
