                         Heard learned counsel for the petitioner as well as

        learned A.P.P.
</p>
<p id="p_3">                         2. The petitioner filed this petition under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_1">Section 482</a> of

        the Cr. P.C. (hereinafter referred to as the 'Code') for quashing the

        order dated 20.07.2012 passed by the learned Chief Judicial

        Magistrate, Banka in Bounsi P.S. Case No. 135/2007/Trial No.

        1326/2012 whereby the learned Chief Judicial Magistrate took

</p><p id="p_4">                         3. Dilip Yadav the informant alleged that Cholera broke

        out in village- Navadih Kulharia. 7-8 years old son of Bablu

        Hembram of the village died in the hospital. His cousin Triveni Yadav

        took his sister-in-law to Bounsi referral hospital for treatment, but
 Patna High Court Cr.Misc. No.39850 of 2013 dt.04-04-2017




        Triveni Yadav also fell ill and he started vomiting. The informant

        took Triveni Yadav to Dr. Salauddin Incharge of Primary Health

        Centre Bounsi, but he did not treat the patient and asked the attendant

        to take the patient to hospital. Dr. Mritunjay Prasad Singh (petitioner)

        was on duty, but he was not present and consequently, on account of

        his absence the patient died. On the basis of fardbeyan of Dilip Yadav

        Bounsi P. S. Case No. 135/2007 was registered under <a href="/doc/1011035/" id="a_5">Sections 323</a>,

        <a href="/doc/409589/" id="a_6">304</a> and <a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_7">34</a> of the Indian Penal Code. The police after investigation

        submitted final form vide final form no. 87/2012 on 23.06.2012

        finding the case false on account of insufficiency of evidence, but the

        learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Banka vide order dated 20.07.2012

        took cognizance against the petitioner and others.

</p><p id="p_5">                         4. Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that from

        perusal of the contents of the F.I.R. itself, it appears that no offence

        under <a href="/doc/1011035/" id="a_8">Sections 323</a>, <a href="/doc/409589/" id="a_9">304</a> and <a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_10">34</a> is made out. The police accordingly

        submitted final form finding the case false. The petitioner was not

        present on the duty. He was on leave. Even if he was not present on

        duty without leave, the petitioner cannot be held responsible for the

        death of the patient who was admitted in the hospital, as the petitioner

        did not admit any patient nor committed any negligence.

</p><p id="p_6">                         5. Learned A.P.P. could not be able to support the order

        impugned.
</p><p id="p_7">            Patna High Court Cr.Misc. No.39850 of 2013 dt.04-04-2017




</p><p id="p_8">                                    6. Having considered the submissions of the learned

                   counsel for the parties and on perusal of the F.I.R. as well as material

                   available on record and the order of learned Chief Judicial Magistrate,

                   Banka, I find that even if the contents of the F.I.R. are taken at their

                   face value, no offence against the petitioner under <a href="/doc/1011035/" id="a_11">Sections 323</a>, <a href="/doc/409589/" id="a_12">304</a>

                   and <a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_13">34</a> of the Indian Penal Code is made out. The petitioner may be

                   departmentally proceeded for his absence from the hospital, but he has

                   not committed any negligence nor he treated the patient. Therefore, no

                   offence under <a href="/doc/409589/" id="a_14">Sections 304</a>, <a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_15">34</a> or 323<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_16"> of the Indian Penal Code</a> is

                   made out. The learned Chief Judicial Magistrate has committed

                   illegality in taking cognizance against the petitioner without any

                   material.
</p>
<p id="p_9">                                    7. Therefore, this quashing petition, so far as the

                   petitioner is concerned is allowed. The order dated 20.07.2012 passed

                   in Bounsi P.S. Case No. 135/2007/Trial No. 1326/2012 with regard to

                   the petitioner is quashed.
