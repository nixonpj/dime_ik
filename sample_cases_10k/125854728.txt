ADDITIONAL SENIOR CIVIL JUDGE, DAVANAGERE,
PARTLY   ALLOWING   THE   CLAIM    PETITION  FOR

     THIS APPEAL COMING ON FOR ORDERS THIS DAY,
THE COURT DELIVERED THE FOLLOWING:-

                      JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">      The    appellant     has    filed this      appeal    seeking

enhancement of compensation against the Judgment

and     Award   dated     09.12.2016       passed    by     the   III

Additional   Senior      Civil   Judge     and VII       MACT,    at

Davangere in MVC No.547/2014.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">      2.     It is the case of the appellant that he has

sustained grievous injuries in a road traffic accident

occurred on 15.04.2014. The Tribunal has awarded a

total compensation of Rs.7,37,000/- with 8% interest

p.a. Aggrieved by the same this appeal is filed.

</p><p id="p_4">      3.     The   learned       counsel    for    the     appellant

submitted that the compensation awarded by the

tribunal is on the lower side and sought to enhance the

same.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                            3</span><p id="p_5">


</p><p id="p_6">     4.    The learned counsel for the respondents

sought to dismiss the appeal as the compensation

awarded by the Tribunal is just and proper.

</p><p id="p_7">     5.    After arguing the matter for some time both

the learned counsel for the parties submits that they are

ready to settle the matter with global compensation.

Their submission is placed on record.

</p><p id="p_8">     6.    I have heard learned counsel for both the

sides and perused the Judgment and Award passed by

the Tribunal. It is seen that the compensation awarded

by the Tribunal on all the heads seems to be little

meager.    Hence, I am inclined to award a global

compensation of Rs.35,000/- in addition to the award

made by the Tribunal.
</p>
<p id="p_9">     7.    Accordingly, the appeal stands disposed of.

The appellant is entitled for a global compensation of

Rs.35,000/-   without   interest   in   addition   to   the

compensation awarded by the Tribunal.
