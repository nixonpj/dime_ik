DATE OF FINAL HEARING                    :      25.11.2009

JUDGMENT
</pre>

<p id="p_1">1. Pleaded case of the plaintiff is that suit property i.e. 7360­7363, Gali Taliyan,

  Pahari Dhiraj Sadar Bazar Delhi was originally owned by her father late Sh.

  Ram Narain and her paternal Uncle i.e. defendant no.5 Daulat Ram Sharma




                                                                           contd/.....
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                          3</span><p id="p_2">



  jointly in equal share. After the death of Sh. Ram Narain on 31.5.91 , the one

  half share of   the undivided suit property was to be   inherited by his three

  children including  plaintiff daughter ,  Sh. Bharat Bhushan ,  his pre deceased

  son and Narender Kumar Sharma, son. Defendant No.1 is   widow of Bharat

  Bhushan   while defendant no.2 , 3 and 4   are his children. Plaintiff's brother

  Narender Kumar Sharma died on 9.6.98 unmarried without any heir of class I.




</p><p id="p_3">                                                          rd
</p><p id="p_4">2. As such plaintiff's claim that  she not only inherits 1/3  share of the ½ share of

  her father but   by virtue of a   Will dated 18.2.98   but she also inherits the

             rd
  entire 1/3   share   of   her deceased brother Narender.     It is her case that

  since she is even otherwise lone class II heir of her deceased brother,  she is

                                                                                     rd
  entitled to inherit his entire  share alone.  Accordingly she claims to be  2/3

  owner of ½ share in the suit property.  
</p>
<p id="p_5">


</p><p id="p_6">3. The suit property is said to be consisting of three floors under occupation of

  11 tenants apart from plaintiff and defendant as shown in site plan attached

  with the plaint.   The property was got mutated in the names of all the LRs




                                                                            contd/.....
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                                 4</span><p id="p_7">



  including plaintiff, defendant no.1 and now deceased Narender Kumar apart

  from defendant no.5 Daulat Ram Sharma in the year 1994. 




</p><p id="p_8">4. Earlier owing to strained relation between the parties, defendant no.1 filed a

  suit for partition in 1999 as suit no.8 of 1999 in the court of LD. Civil Judge but

  the same was unilaterally got dismissed as   withdrawn during the course of

  trial after the pleadings were over on 18.4.2001.




</p><p id="p_9">5. Since plaintiff  intending to get the suit property partitioned, she filed the suit in

  hand seeking partition of the suit property by meets and bounds.




</p><p id="p_10">6. Upon issuance  of notice of this suit , defendant no.1  to 4   filed a detailed

  written statement apart from a counter claim   for seeking possession of the

  suit property which is in possession of the plaintiff apart from damages.    No

  separate WS was filed on behalf of defendant no.5.   Case of the defendant

  No.1 to 4  as per WS is that suit is not maintainable in view of <a href="/doc/1873176/" id="a_1">Section 23</a> of

  Hindu   Succession   Act   in   so   far   as   the   suit   property   is   a   dwelling   house,




                                                                                         contd/.....
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                                5</span><p id="p_11">



  occupied by the family members of late Sh. Ram Narain while plaintiff is a

  married   daughter   since   1978.     It   is   pleaded   that   upon   death   of   Sh.   Ram

  Narain on 31.5.91 plaintiff had come to the suit property to mourn the death of

  her father, and since then is illegally occupying a room on the second floor

  alongwith her husband and son.  It is pleaded that the Will cited by the plaintiff

  is forged document and that suit has not been valued properly.   It is rather

  pleaded that deceased Narender Kumar Sharma had actually excuted the Will

  dated 14.4.98 by virtue of which he appointed defendant no.2 and 3 as his

  Successors.    On merits the blood relationship between the plaintiff and the

  defendants has not been denied.   It is rather pleaded that this suit property

  was partition between late Sh. Ram Narain and defendant no.5 , his brother ,

  long ago and that now all of this property has nothing to do with   defendant

  no.5.   As such it is prayed that plaint of the plaintiff be dismissed




</p><p id="p_12">7. In the counter claim for recovery of damages and possession, defendant no.1

  to 4 have contended that since occupation of  part of the suit property by the

  plaintiff and his family is just a license and that the same stand   terminated




                                                                                      contd/.....

  vide notice dated 10.5.2000.  As such it is prayed that decree of possession

  be passed against the plaintiff apart from decree of damages @Rs.2000/­ per

  month.
</p>
<p id="p_14">


</p><p id="p_15">8. In separate replication filed to the WS plaintiff reiterated her pleaded case and

  contended that since majority of the suit property is occupied by tenants, while

  remaining   is   in   possession   of   plaintiff   since   February'1998   apart   from   the

  defendant, <a href="/doc/1873176/" id="a_2">section 23</a> of Hindu Succession Act is not applicable.   On merits

  of   the   counter   claim   it   is  contended   by   her   that   the   notice   terminating   the

  license  is illegal and void.

</p><p id="p_17">9. This suit was initially filed in the original side of Hon'ble High Court.  However,

  the   same   was   transferred   to   District   Court   upon   change   of   pecuniary
