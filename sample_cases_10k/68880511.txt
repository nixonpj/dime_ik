Seeta Bhansali Vs. Satpal &amp; ors.  
          SUIT FOR DECLARATION AND PERMANENT INJUNCTION

JUDGMENT:
</pre>
<p id="p_1">1.             Facts lies in narrow compass and the same are as under:-
</p><p id="p_2">               Plaintiff claims that she had purchased the suit property i.e. house
bearing No. 186/58-A, situated at Street No. 4, Rameshwar Nagar, Azad Pur,
Delhi-110033 which is a double storey house. The property earlier was owned
by Sh. Ram Sarup and Sh. Nathi Lal - owners of land measuring 200 sq. yards
denoted then by the Municipal Nos. 186/58 as the property was joint and
undivided. The said property was purchased by them by way of a Registered
Sale Deed No. 5301 entered in Book No. 1, Vol. No. 120 on pages No. 352 to
355 in the office of J.S.R. Delhi on 04.11.1959. The said property was sold by
them to Shri Sri Ram and Shri Sri Chand both sons of Lt. Sh. Thakarya by way
of Registered Sale deed executed on 11.10.1962 which is also duly registered
as document No. 11997 entered in Addl. Book No. 1, Vol. No. 834 on pages No.
117 to 122 in the office of Sub Registrar, Delhi on 12.10.1962. Thereafter, the
said Shri Sri Ram and Shri Sri Chand had divided the property/land in two equal
portions and raised a construction over the same. In the record of the Municipal
Corporation of Delhi separate Municipal numbers were allotted to Shri Sri Ram
and Shri Sri Chand and i.e. bearing No. 186/58 and 186/58A . They had also got
installed separate electricity and water connection in their own shares. Now
Shri Sri Chand had sold his divided portion of 100 sq. yards to Sh. Sanjay Jain


Suit No. 270/2010                                                           2 of  9
Seeta Bhansali Vs. Satpal &amp; ors.  
</p><p id="p_3"> S/o Sh. G.C. Jain and Shri Praveen Jain S/o Lt. Sh. Om Prakash Jain by virtue
of registered Sale deed executed on 29.06.2007 which is also duly registered
as Document No. 7605 in Addl. Book No. 1, Vol. No. 996 on pages 187 to 192
on 29.06.2007 in the office of the Sub Registrar(VI-A) Pitam Pura, Delhi. Said
Sh. Sanjay Jain S/o Sh. G.C. Jain and Sh. Praveen Jain S/o Lt. Sh. Om Prakash
Jain had thereafter sold the said separated constructed property bearing No.
186/58-A measuring 100 sq. yards and situated at Ramesh Nagar, Street No. 4,
Azad Pur, Delhi-110033 to the plaintiff herein on 21.01.2008 by virtue of
registered Sale deed executed on 21.01.2008 which is duly registered as
document No. 883 in Addl. Book No. 1, vol. No. 1570 on pages 47 to 58 on
21.01.2008 in the office of Sub Registrar (VI A) Pitampura, Delhi. Thus, plaintiff
became the absolute and exclusive owner of the suit property. After purchasing
the same she had also carried out construction over the same. Now Shri Sri
Ram the brother of Shri Sri Chand also expired and the defendants are the legal
heirs living in the said property/adjoining property. It is further claimed that the
said legal heirs of Shri Sri Ram had no legal right, title or interest in the suit
property bearing Bearing No. 186/58-A. Still in the month of March, 2010 they
started creating nuisance and interference with the motive to harass and torture
the plaintiff. In these circumstances, the plaintiff was compelled to approach the
Court and seek a declaratory relief as to her right in the property coupled with an
order of injunction against the defendants not to create any nuisance or
hindrance/prevent the plaintiff from using the property bearing No. 186/58A,


Suit No. 270/2010                                                            3 of  9
Seeta Bhansali Vs. Satpal &amp; ors.  
</p><p id="p_4"> Rameshwar Nagar, Azad pur, Delhi i.e. the suit property.
</p><p id="p_5">2.             Written statement was filed by the defendants contending therein
that the suit so filed was not maintainable in as much as the plaintiff wanted to
get a declaration about the property No. 186/58A for which appropriate course
of action would have been to approach the MCD. Furthermore, it was stated that
suit was devoid of any cause of action and liable to be dismissed on account of
non-joinder of necessary parties as the plaintiff had not made the brother of the
defendant as party to the suit.
</p><p id="p_6">               On merits the broad substratum of the case of the plaintiff is that
she had purchased the suit property and the factum that the property was earlier
owned by Sh. Sri Ram and Shri Sri Chand was not disputed. On the aspect of
the cause of action defendants have denied that they had tried to create any
such nuisance or intended to assert any right in the suit property owned by Shri
Sri Chand and subsequently sold by him.
</p><p id="p_7">3.             Pleadings were complete. On the basis of the pleadings of the
parties, following issues were framed by my Ld. Predecessor on 10.05.2011:-
i.             Whether this Court has no pecuniary jurisdiction to try this case?
</p><p id="p_8">               OPD.
</p><p id="p_9">ii.            Whether the appropriate Court fees has not affixed by the plaintiff
               as per <a href="/doc/138097064/" id="a_1">Court Fees Act</a> and the value of suit has not assessed as
               per the Suit Valuation Act? OPD.</p><pre id="pre_2">
iii.           Whether the plaintiff is entitled for decree of declaration, as prayed


Suit No. 270/2010                                                             4 of  9
Seeta Bhansali Vs. Satpal &amp; ors.  
                for? OPP
iv.            Whether plaintiff is entitled for a decree of permanent injunction,
               as prayed for? OPP
v.             Any other relief?
               Parties were directed to lead evidence.
</pre><p id="p_10">4.             On behalf of plaintiff, plaintiff herself had stepped into the witness
box and tendered her evidence by way of an affidavit Ex. PW1/A in lieu of
examination-in-chief and relied upon documents i.e. copy of sale deed as Ex.
PW1/1, copy of documents of water and electricity bills as Mark A collectively,
copy of sale deed as Ex. PW1/2, copy of another sale deed as Ex. PW1/3. She
was duly cross examined by the defendants. Thereafter, P.E. was closed.
</p><p id="p_11">5.             On behalf of defendants, Rajbir Singh defendant No. 4            had
stepped into the witness box and tendered his evidence by way of an affidavit
Ex. DW1/A in lieu of examination-in-chief. No document was proved by him. He
was duly cross examined by the Ld. counsel for plaintiff. Thereafter, D.E. was
closed.
</p><p id="p_12">6.             Heard either side.
</p><p id="p_13">7.             My issue-wise findings are as under:
</p><p id="p_14">               Issue No. 1 and 2: -
</p><p id="p_15">               Common discussion qua these issues shall suffice. Further in my
opinion, viz-a-viz these issues, it would be relevant to revert to the written
statement. Now the defendants had not at all denied the factum that the suit


Suit No. 270/2010                                                             5 of  9
Seeta Bhansali Vs. Satpal &amp; ors.  
</p><p id="p_16"> property was purchased by Seeta Bhansali from the previous owners namely
Sanjay Jain and Parveen Jain and further had admitted the fact that Shri Sri
Chand had sold his share i.e. 100 sq. yards to Sanjay Jain and Parveen Jain.
Thus, there was no dispute at all in regard to the fact that the suit property was
purchased by the plaintiff and that too by sale deed. Under such circumstances,
when the opposite party does not controvert the title of the plaintiff in the suit
property/the documents of purchase the contention that the plaintiff ought to
have affixed the Court fees on the purchase value becomes an untenable one.
There was no need for framing of such an issue. It needs no gain saying that
the pleadings have to be read holistically and not pedantically - oblivious of the
real controversy. Simplicitor declaration as sought for by the plaintiff shall
suffice which is in a manner confirmation of the pre-existing rights of the plaintiff
for clarification purposes alone and does not involve any extinguishment of any
claim raised by the defendants or any cloud upon the title of the plaintiff.
</p><p id="p_17">               Furthermore, the reading of the entire written statement reveals
that except by baldly denying or contending that this Court has no pecuniary
jurisdiction or the suit has not been property valued for the court fees nothing
much else has been elaborated in the written statement. Viz-a-viz these two
aspects not even a single question has been put to the witness - PW-1 during
her cross-examination. Plaintiff is also in settled possession of the suit property.
As such in my opinion, in the given set of facts and circumstances, these issues
were not in pith and substance issues which ought to have been framed at the


Suit No. 270/2010                                                              6 of  9
Seeta Bhansali Vs. Satpal &amp; ors.  
</p><p id="p_18"> first instance. These issues are decided accordingly in favour of the plaintiff.
</p><p id="p_19">8.             Issue No. 3 and 4:-
</p><p id="p_20">               The issue No. 3 and 4 are also interconnected and are based on
same evidence and hence, a common discussion shall suffice. Plaintiff asserts
that the defendants are disputing her right in the suit property and creating
hindrance in peaceful enjoyment of the suit property.
</p><p id="p_21">               Per contra, Ld. counsel for defendant submits that this suit is in a
manner intending to seek an affirmation of the fact that the property owned by
the plaintiff bears No. 186/158 A. Otherwise there was no need for filing of the
present suit as the defendants does not challenge the factum of ownership.
Now to my mind, a perusal of the previous sale deeds reveal that this suit
property alongwith property of defendants was a joint one and was measuring
200 sq.yards. Now suit property's No. 186/158 A was duly mentioned in the
sale deed executed by Shri Sri Chand brother of Shri Sri Ram in favour of
Sanjay Jain and Parveen Jain. It was further stated in the said documents that
the suit property has been carved out from the undivided property bearing No.
186/58.   Thus, in the documents there is no dispute whatsoever about the
number of the properties of either side. MCD had also levied tax separately.
Thus, the contention of the defendant that this suit was solely filed for the
purposes of seeking an adjudication about the number of the suit property is not
tenable. Second contention was that the suit was devoid of any cause of action
</p><p id="p_22">- a real trigger for filing of the suit and the entire proceedings are surplus age.
</p>

<p id="p_23">Suit No. 270/2010                                                            7 of  9
Seeta Bhansali Vs. Satpal &amp; ors.  
</p><p id="p_24"> Now the cause of action paragraph i.e. para No. 18 state the incidents which
necessitated the filing of the suit and this cause of action is denied by the
defendant in the written statement. Coming to the evidence by way of affidavit of
PW-1 he had again specifically asserted that her ownership rights were not
accepted by the defendants and they were creating hindrances. Reference is
made to para No. 16, 18 and 19 of the evidence by way of affidavit(there is no
para No. 17 in the evidence by way of affidavit). This deposition/assertion has
not been challenged during the cross-examination. Cause of action does not
means or signify that the plaintiff has to first of all approach the police or seek
any document from them and basing thereon file a suit for injunction. Upon the
reading of the pleadings of the either side there is a controversy which needs
adjudication - the rights of the plaintiff on account of being the owner are not
being respected/threatened as such cause of action exists in favour of the
plaintiff.
</p><p id="p_25">9.             No other submissions has been raised by either side. Issues are
decided accordingly in favour of the plaintiff and against the defendants.
</p><p id="p_26">10.            Plaintiff is entitled for relief of declaration as she is owner of suit
property bearing No. 186/58A, Rameshwar Nagar, Azad Pur, Delhi-33 which
she had purchased by way of registered sale deed from Sh. Sanjay and
Praveen Jain and secondly defendants are restrained from creating any
hindrance or nuisance thereby depriving the plaintiff and her family members
from exclusively using the said suit property. No order as to cost. Decreesheet
