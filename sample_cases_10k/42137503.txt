 BEFORE THE MADURAI BENCH OF MADRAS HIGH COURT
DATED: 30.06.2014
CORAM
THE HONOURABLE MR.JUSTICE V.RAMASUBRAMANIAN
and
THE HONOURABLE MS.JUSTICE V.M.VELUMANI

WRIT PETITION(MD)No.10490 of 2014


S.Balasubramanian					.. 	Petitioner

					   Vs.

1.The District Collector,
  Tirunelveli District,
  Tirunelveli.

2.The Tahsildar,
  Tenkasi Taluk,
  Tirunelveli District.			.. Respondents

	 Writ Petition filed under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of
India praying for issuance of a Writ of Certiorarified Mandamus, calling for
the records of the second respondent in           X.K.M.2/2896/2014, dated
21.05.2014 and quash the same as it was passed by non-application of mind and
devoid of merits and consequently direct the respondents to issue the
community certificate to the petitioner as Hindu Isai Vellalar based on the
petitioner's application dated 18.02.2014 within the period stipulated by
this Court and pass such further or other orders.

!For Petitioner		: Mr.Ananth C.Rajesh

^For Respondents	: Mr.A.K.Baskarapandian,			
			  Special Government Pleader.

:ORDER
</pre><p id="p_1">(Order of the Court was made by  V.RAMASUBRAMANIAN,J.)
		The petitioner has come up with the above writ petition
challenging an order passed by the second respondent refusing to grant
community certificate to him, to the effect that he belongs to the Hindu Isai
Vellalar community.
</p>
<p id="p_2">		2.Heard Mr.Ananth C.Rajesh, learned counsel for the petitioner
and Mr.A.K.Baskarapandian, learned Special Government Pleader for the
respondents.
</p>
<p id="p_3">		3.The petitioner applied on 18.02.2014 to the second respondent
for the grant of community certificate to him.
</p><p id="p_4">		4.The petitioner claimed to belong to Hindu Isai Vellalar
Community which is classified as Most Backward Class.  By the order impugned
in the writ petition, the application of the petitioner was rejected.
Therefore, the petitioner is before this Court.
</p>
<p id="p_5">		5.The order impugned in the writ petition does not state any
reason, other than stating that upon enquiry, the petitioner has not produced
any document to show that he belongs to the said community. There is no
discussion about any of the documents produced by the petitioner. Therefore,
the impugned order is clearly vitiated by non application of mind.
</p>
<p id="p_6">		6.It is seen from the set of documents filed by the petitioner
that the brother of the petitioner has a community certificate, issued way
back on 26.04.1989 by the competent authority to the effect that he belongs
to the Hindu Isai Vellalar community.  When the brother holds a community
certificate, which has not so far been impeached, we do not know how the
second respondent came to the conclusion that there is no evidence to show
the community of the petitioner.  The impugned order is clearly vitiated by
malice in law and non application of mind. Therefore, it is liable to be set
aside. Accordingly, the writ petition is allowed, the impugned order is set
aside.  The second respondent is directed to enquire into the matter afresh
and pass appropriate orders in accordance with law, within a period of four
weeks, taking into account the fact that the brother of the petitioner holds
a community certificate which has not so far been impeached.  The petitioner
shall also file all documents in his possession.  No costs.
