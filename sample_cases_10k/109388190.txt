AWARD


1.</pre><p id="p_1">           The claimant has approached this Court directly under Section 10 (4<a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_1">A)

     of Industrial Disputes Act</a>, 1947.
</p>
<p id="p_2">

</p><p id="p_3">2.           The case, set up by the workman is that he had been working with the

     management on the post of 'Supervisor' on monthly salary of Rs.8000/- for the

     last two years.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                            2</span><p id="p_4">




</p><p id="p_5">3.           That he had been performing his duty honestly and to the entire

     satisfaction of the management, but the management failed to provide him legal

     facilities. It is further alleged by him that when he started demanding the same,

     the management got annoyed and illegally terminated his service w.e.f

     10.11.05, without paying him the earned wages for the month of August and

     September, 2005.
</p>
<p id="p_6">

</p><p id="p_7">4.           It is also alleged that no show cause notice was issued or no enquiry

     was held by the management as against the claimant. That the claimant is

     without any gainful employment from the date of his alleged termination.



</p><p id="p_8">5.           That the claimant sent a demand notice dated 26.11.05, to the

     management but to no effect. That the claimant has, therefore, sought

     reinstatement with full back wages.
</p>
<p id="p_9">

</p><p id="p_10">6.           The management has contested the claim of the claimant. It is alleged

     by them that the management is a duly recognized collection agency for various

     banks and financial institutions. That in order to collect payments from various

     clients the management has to engage certain specialised persons to do the

     particular job.   For this, the management enters into a contract with such

     persons and deals with them on principal to principal basis. That there never

     existed any relationship of employer and employee between the management
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                             3</span>

     and the claimant. That the claimant was engaged purely on contractual basis.

     That he was not entitled to any fixed remuneration. That the claimant had also

     been working for other business identities engaged in the similar business. That

     the present case has been filed only to harass the management. That the present

     claim is an after thought and is filed just to extract illegal money from the

     management.      The other allegations of the claimant have specifically been

     denied and it is urged that the claim of the claimant be dismissed.



</p><p id="p_11">7.           The claimant has filed rejoinder, in which he has reiterated, what is

     stated in his statement of claim.      He has denied the allegations of the

     management.
</p>
<p id="p_12">

</p><p id="p_13">8.           On the pleadings of the parties, following issues arose and were framed

on 29.03.06

</p><p id="p_14">1.           Whether there is a relationship of workman and employer between
     the parties to this case?OPP

</p><p id="p_15">2.           Whether the claimant was illegally and/or unjustifiably terminated
     from service w.e.f 10.11.2005?OPP

</p><p id="p_16">3.           Relief



</p><p id="p_17">9.           The claimant has examined himself and one Labour Inspector, WW2,

     in support of his case. The management, however, has been pleased to examine

     only one witness who was examined as MW1.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                          4</span><p id="p_18">

</p><p id="p_19">10.       I have carefully gone through the entire relevant material appearing on

  record and have given my considered thought, to the arguments that have been

  advanced, by the parties. My findings, issue wise, are as under-:



ISSUE NO.1

</p><p id="p_20">11.       The management has denied having entered into any relationship of

  employer and employee with the claimant.           It has been alleged that his

  appointment was on principal to principal basis and that no fixed

  wages/remuneration was settled with him.         The claimant, during the cross

  examination was confronted with the document Ex.WW1/M1, on which, the

  claimant has agreed to have put signature at point 'A'. He has further admitted

  in his cross examination, that he is a Graduate and well conversant with the

  English language. He has admitted that the management is duly recognized

  collection agency for various banks and financial institutions.



</p><p id="p_21">12.       The claimant further agrees and admits that the job of the management

  is to engage certain people, who are specialized in particular job for the

  collection of payments.      The claimant admittedly does not posses any

  appointment letter, salary slip or any other document, to show that he was

  working as management's employee. The document Ex.WW1/M1, admittedly

  is the document which was executed between the parties when the relationship

  between the parties came into existence. A perusal of this document will clearly

  indicate that the intention of the parties was not to create an employer and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                           5</span>

  employee relationship between the parties. The claimant was not assigned any

  fixed duty on day today basis. In other words, his duty hours were not fixed, his

  remuneration/wages were not fixed. The normal construction of the document

  Ex.WW1/M1, admittedly executed by the claimant, indicates that the claimant

  was not engaged or appointed as an employee of the management. He was to

  act on principal to principal basis. The said document clearly provides that the

  claimant was not to represent himself as an employee of the management to

  any of the clients of the management.
</p>
<p id="p_22">

</p><p id="p_23">13.       The claimant admittedly was engaged to collect the payment from the

  clients of the management on commission basis. The amount of work done by

  the claimant was not subject to any immediate supervision. The claimant was

  not required to perform duty during particular fixed hours. There is nothing

  visible in the document Ex.WW1/M1 that the parties ever intended to enter into

  a relationship of employer and employee between the parties. The claimant has

  placed no document to prove on record to show that in fact, he has acted as an

  employee of the management. He has also failed to adduce any evidence on

  record to show that he was being paid wages at the rate of Rs.8000/- per

  month, by the management. The claimant has, therefore, failed to discharge the

  burden of proof that he was appointed as an employee of the management.



</p><p id="p_24">14.       It was held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in 'Neel Giri Cooperative

  marketing soceity Ltd. Versus State of Tamil Nadu,' 2004 LLR 351that;
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                      6</span>

</p><p id="p_25">          "The burden of proof for existence of relationship of employer and
employee lies upon the person who sets plea of its existence.


</p><p id="p_26">                           For determination of concept of employment, the
                essential ingredients are:-
</p>
<pre id="pre_2">          I          Employer - one who employees, i.e. engages the
                     services of other persons;

          Ii         Employee-one who works for another for hire;and

          Iii        Contract of employment - the contract of services
</pre><p id="p_27">                     between the employer and the employee whereunder
                     the employee agrees to serve the employer subject to
                     his control supervision:.
</p>
<p id="p_28">          Further, it was held in case law reported as 'Dhyan Singh Vs. Raman

Lal', 2001 LLR 148, Madhya Pradesh, High Court that:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">                     "To prove a contract of employment there has to be a
         direct evidence to show some nexus between the claimant and
         respondent. This can be of any kind such as appointment letter,
         monthly payment slip, deduction of PF, payment of any dues
         which would show that he was in the employment.                Any
         correspondence wherein the respondent has admitted that the
         claimant was in his employment. In substance, the court are in
         favour of documentary evidence to record definite findings of
         such type of issue.     They are the best piece of evidence for
         coming to a conclusion one way or the other".
</blockquote>


<p id="p_29">15.       The material available on record indicates, that the claimant

  has not been able to discharge the burden of having shown that he was

  employed by the management as a workman.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                        7</span><p id="p_30">

</p><p id="p_31">16.          The testimony of the witness WW2, Smt. Anita Kalsi, Labour

  Inspector, also does not help the claimant in any manner. From her

  cross examination, it is clear that the management has contested the

  claim of the claimant, in as much as, they admittedly filed a reply to

  the claim of the claimant before the Labour Department. It appears

  that the Labour Inspector unilateraly prepared her report Ex.WW2/A

  and did not try to ascertain the truth especially when the management

  had denied the status of the claimant as an employee.



</p><p id="p_32">17.          In any case, since the claimant himself has failed to prove that

  he was employed as a workman by the management, his claim is not

  maintainable.      Further in his pleadings, the claimant himself has

  described him as a 'Supervisor'. The moment, the claimant admitted

  himself to be a 'Supervisor', it is not understood as to how he has

  claimed himself to be a workman, simultaneously.         In any case, the

  claimant has failed to prove that he was an employee of the

  management. This issue, is liable to be answered against him and is,

  therefore, answered against him.
</p>
<p id="p_33">

ISSUE NO.2

</p><p id="p_34">18.          As discussed hereinabove, the claimant has miserably failed to

  show that there is a relationship of employer and employee between the

  parties.      It cannot be said, that the claimant was illegally and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                     8</span>

  unjustifiably terminated by the management on 10.11.05.       In other

  words, when there was no such relationship, question of illegal

  termination does not arise at all. This issue is, accordingly, answered

  against the claimant and in favour of the management.



RELIEF

</p><p id="p_35">19.      In view of the findings, recorded hereinabove, the claimant is

  not entitled to any relief, his claim is liable to be dismissed and is,

  accordingly, dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_36">

</p><p id="p_37">20.      An award , in the aforesaid terms, is hereby passed.
