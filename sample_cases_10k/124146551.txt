              -------------------------------------------------
              W.P.(c) No. 29299 OF 2014-J
              -------------------------------------------------
       DATED THIS THE 14th DAY OF JANUARY, 2015.

                         J U D G M E N T
</pre>
<p id="p_1">     The petitioner is a Charitable Trust. This writ petition

is filed aggrieved by Ext.P10 proceedings issued by

Secretary of the 1st respondent Grama Panchayat rejecting

application for building permit submitted by them for

construction of a building in the property purchased by the

petitioner as per Ext.P1 sale deed. In Ext.P10 proceedings it

is mentioned that the building permit cannot be granted

because description of the nature of property contained in

the records is as 'Nilam' (wet land).
</p>
<p id="p_2">     2.   Contention of the petitioner is that there existed a

building in the property in question, which was assigned

with building number III/288 by the 1st respondent

panchayat. The petitioner had produced prior title deeds of

the property, Exts.P2 to P4, which reveal that the

description of the property in all those documents since the

year 1983 onwards is as 'Purayidam' (garden land).

Assessment of the building which existed in the land is

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">W.P.(c) No.29299/2014               -2-</span>


evident from Ext.P6, the extract of Property Tax Assessment

Register as well as from Ext.P7 Tax Receipt, dated 18-10-

2014. Exhibit P8 certificate of the Village officer is

produced to the effect that the building which was situated

in the property was having the age of more than 15 years. It

is stated that the application for permit for construction of

the Cultural complex was submitted after demolition of the

said building. Exhibit P11 photographs produced by the

petitioner would show that the property is remaining as dry

land surrounded by various buildings.
</p>
<p id="p_3">         3.       Further contention of the petitioner is that the 1st

respondent was duty bound to ascertain the present

condition of the land, before rejecting the application for

building permit. Without ascertaining the present condition

as to whether the land is remaining as wet land or paddy

field, the rejection of the application made summarily by

depending on the description of the property in the revenue

records, was totally illegal and unsustainable, is the

contention. The petitioner relies on various decisions of this

court on the subject.

</p><p id="p_5">         4.       Heard; Standing counsel appearing on behalf of

1st respondent.
</p>
<p id="p_6">         5.       It is held by a Division Bench of this court in a

recent          decision    <a href="/doc/15266663/" id="a_1">Aishabeevi    and   another         V.

Superintendent</a> of police, Ernakulam (2014 (3) KHC

678 (DB) that, the bar to grant building permit contained

under Section 14 of the Conservation of Paddy Land and

Wetland Act, 2008 is not applicable to a land converted

prior to commencement of the said Act, even if such

conversion was made in violation of the Land Utilization

Order. It is held that Section 3 &amp; Section 13 of the said Act

has no retrospective operation and conversions made prior

to coming into force of the Act, i.e: before 12-08-2008,

cannot be said as violative of provisions of the Act. It is

further held that, whether the land in question would come

under the definition of paddy land or wetland under the

<a href="/doc/755257/" id="a_2">Conservation Act</a> is a matter to be determined based on

facts as existed on the ground and not on the basis of

description contained in revenue records. This court further

held that there is no provision contained either in the Land

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">W.P.(c) No.29299/2014                -4-</span>


Utilization Order or in the <a href="/doc/755257/" id="a_3">Conservation Act</a> prescribing any

legal presumption that in the absence of an order granting

permission for such conversion, the land converted after

commencement of the KLU order is to be treated as illegally

converted land and permit for construction of the building

cannot be granted.
</p>
<p id="p_7">         6.       In view of the legal position remaining settled as

above, rejection of the application for building permit,

merely for the reason that description of the land in the

revenue records remains as 'Nilam', cannot be sustained. It

is for the 1st respondent panchayat to consider the physical

position existing as on the land and to ascertain whether the

land in question was converted prior to enactment of the

Conservation of Paddy Land and Wetland Act. If it is

convinced that the conversion was made prior to enactment

of Act, there is no justifiable reason to reject the building

permit.
</p>
<p id="p_8">         7.       Under the above mentioned circumstances the

writ petition is allowed and Ext.P10 is hereby quashed. The

Secretary of the 1st respondent is directed to re-consider the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">W.P.(c) No.29299/2014          -5-</span>


application for building permit in the light of the

observations contained herein above and to take an

appropriate decision with respect to granting of building

permit, at the earliest possible, at any rate within a period

of one month from the date of receipt of a copy of this

judgment.
