HIGH COURT OF JUDICATURE AT ALLAHABAD
 
 

?Court No. - 18
 

 
Case :- WRIT - A No. - 46897 of 2014
 

 
Petitioner :- Devendra Kumar Sharma
 
Respondent :- State Of U.P. And 03 Ors
 
Counsel for Petitioner :- M.M. Sahai,Hritudhwaj Pratap Sahi,Pankaj Kumar Srivastava,Samarath Singh,Sankalp Narain
 
Counsel for Respondent :- C.S.C.
 

 
Hon'ble Rohit Ranjan Agarwal,J.
</pre> 
<p id="p_1">Heard Sri V.K. Singh, learned Senior Counsel, assisted by Sri Vats Narayan, learned counsel for the petitioner and learned Standing Counsel for the State respondents.
</p> 
<p id="p_2">This writ petition has been filed assailing the order dated 28.08.2014 passed by the respondent no. 2 whereby the representation of the petitioner for regularization has been rejected solely on the ground that his writ petition being Writ Petition No. 33169 of 1991, filed for regularization was dismissed on 21.03.2012 and Special Appeal No. 733 of 2012, challenging the order passed by the learned Writ Court, was allowed by this Court on 04.02.2013 and during this period the petitioner did not work and, thus, there was break of service and he was not entitled for regularization under Section 33-B of U.P. Secondary Education Services Selection Board Act, 1982 (hereinafter referred to as the 'Act of 1982').
</p> 
<p id="p_3">Sri V.K. Singh, learned Senior Counsel, appearing for the petitioner has submitted that petitioner alongwith one Ashok Kumar Gupta was appointed in Raghuveer Sahai Inter College, Aligarh on 16.01.1991 and was continuously working in the institution in question. A writ petition being Writ Petition No. 33169 of 1991 was filed for payment of salary and this Court on 21.01.1994 directed that petitioner shall continue to work and be paid current salary from the month of January 1994. 
</p> 
<p id="p_4">It appears that the said writ petition was dismissed in default on 11.03.1998, however, the said writ petition was restored by order dated 14.07.2011 and finally was decided on 21.03.2012. Special appeal preferred against the order of learned Writ Court was allowed on 04.02.2013 wherein the matter was remanded by Division Bench to learned Writ Court to decide the same afresh. On 23.01.2014 this Court directed the respondent no. 2 to consider the claim of the petitioner for regularization in accordance with the provisions of Section 33-B of the Act of 1982.
</p> 
<p id="p_5">Sri Singh, learned Senior Counsel, invited attention of the Court to the order passed by the respondent no. 2 regularizing the services of one Ashok Kumar Gupta, who was appointed in the same transaction, on 04.12.2017, while the petitioner has been denied the benefit of regularization solely on the ground that he did not work during the period his writ petition was dismissed and special appeal preferred by him was allowed. He has placed reliance on a judgment of Apex Court passed in the case of <a href="/doc/422729/" id="a_1">M/s. Shree Chamundi Mopeds Ltd. vs Church Or South India Trust Assn</a>. 1992 (3) SC 1, wherein the Apex Court has held that once the order has been quashed it would be deemed that the order was never in existence.
</p> 
<p id="p_6">Per contra learned Standing, apart from what stated in the counter affidavit, submitted that the order impugned is clear to the effect that there is break in service of the petitioner and the provisions of Section 33-B of the Act of 1982 would not be applicable in the present case. He further submits that the case law relied upon by learned Senior Counsel is also not applicable in the case of the petitioner.
</p> 
<p id="p_7">Having heard learned counsel for the parties and perusing the material on record, I find that it is not in dispute that petitioner was appointed in the year 1991 alongwith one Ashok Kumar Gupta. He continued to work on the strength of interim order passed by this Court on 21.01.1994. However, his writ petition seeking regularization was dismissed in default on 11.03.1998 but subsequently restored. This Court dismissed the writ petition on merits on 21.03.2012, special appeal filed against the said order was allowed and order dated 21.03.2012 was set-aside. 
</p> 
<p id="p_8">The contention of learned Senior Counsel as goes to the extent that as the order dated 21.03.2012 was set-aside, it would be presumed that it was never in existence, as held by the Apex Court in the case of M/s. Shree Chamundi Mopeds Ltd. (supra) has force. Apart from this, the other candidate namely Ashok Kumar Gupta has already been regularized by the order of respondent no. 2. The objection raised by learned Standing Counsel does not have force to the effect that there was break of service on the strength of order of learned Writ Court dated 21.03.2012, which was set-aside by Division Bench of this Court in special appeal.
</p> 
<p id="p_9">In view of the above, the order impugned dated 28.08.2014 passed by respondent no. 2 is hereby quashed. Writ petition stands allowed, accordingly. The respondents may proceed in the matter, in accordance with law, and pass appropriate orders for regularization of services of the petitioner.
</p> 
<p id="p_10">Order Date :- 17.12.2019
