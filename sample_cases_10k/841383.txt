CIVIL APPEAL NO.7359 OF 2003




S.B. SINHA , J :
</p>

<p id="p_2">	These two appeals involving common questions of law and fact and 
arising out of the same judgment were taken up for hearing together and are 
being disposed of by this common judgment.
</p><p id="p_3">	Sheo Shanker Lal Srivastava, Appellant in Civil Appeal No.7539 of 
2003, was appointed as a Stenographer in the Office of the Consolidation 
Commissioner, U.P. in the year 1963.  He was deputed to work with the Lok 
Ayukta in the year 1978.   One Arvind Kumar Singhal, Respondent No.3, 
was appointed as a Typist in the said office in the year 1980.  Since 1988 he 
has been working as a Public Relations Officer.  The post of Personal 
Assistant, which the Appellant was holding was redesignated as Private 
Secretary.  He was later on given a higher scale of pay of Rs.3,000-4,500/- 
by way of promotion with effect from 21.07.1995.  Owing to certain acts of 
misconduct, the Appellant had been censured and warned.  The Appellant 
was asked to hand over the key of his almirah but he refused to do so.  He 
also used indecent language.  The said alimirah was sealed.  He was served 
with an order of suspension.  The said seal on the almirah was broken at a 
later date i.e. 15.01.1988 and it was opened with a duplicate key.  A 
chargesheet  containing  six charges was thereafter served upon him.
</p>				
<p id="p_4">	The Appellant in response to a show cause notice, filed show cause.  
Upon receiving his explanation, four out of six charges were dropped.   The 
charges wherefor a departmental proceeding was initiated against him are as 
under :
</p>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">"Charge No. 1</span>
		
<p id="p_5">	On  13.1.98 Deputy  Secretary accompanied by 
Hon'ble Lok Ayukta went on round to your room at 
10.30 A.M. and he wanted to see if there was any 
undisposed of matters and documents lying with you and 
found that in violation of his orders, you had locked your 
almirah.  On making request, you did not open the 
almirah yourself and when you were asked to give its 
key, you got enraged and using a very indecent and 
vulgar language, you refused to hand over the key and in 
a fit of anger crying at the pitch of your voice you said 
that you may be suspended but you will not give the key 
and you did not give the key.  Therefore, you are guilty 
of committing indiscipline and misconduct. 	
</p>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">Charge No. 2</span>
<p id="p_6">	When you did not give the key of your almirah 
then your almirah was opened on 15.1.1998 by making 
alternative arrangements.  The material which was 
recovered from your almirah has been mentioned in 
enclosure-1 and in regard to which your guilt has been 
shown in the remarks column of enclosure.  In this 
manner you are guilty of neglecting and suppressing 
work.."
</p>
 		
<p id="p_7"> 	 As regard Charge No. 3, although the explanation of the Appellant 
was not accepted, the Lok Ayukta did not intend to proceed therewith. 
</p>
<p id="p_8">The Appellant filed his show cause to the charges on or about 
17.08.1998.  He was asked to disclose the name of his witness and the 
documents upon which he intends to rely upon.  In the said departmental  
inquiry, the Appellant intended to engage a lawyer, which was declined, 
inter alia, on the ground that the department did not engage any lawyer and 
the charges levelled against him were simple in nature.  The Lok Ayukta 
took over upon himself the burden of conducting the disciplinary 
proceedings against the Appellant himself as the Appellant contended that 
no outsider should be appointed as an Inquiry Officer.  The Inquiry Officer 
noticed the dilatory tactics adopted by the Appellant.  He had been raising 
new contentions from  time to time.  One Shri J.C. Upreti, who was the 
Deputy Secretary of the Office of the Lok Ayukta, at all material times, was 
examined on 14.10.1998. The Appellant did not cross-examine him as his 
request to adjourn the proceeding was declined.  The Appellant did not 
examine himself despite several opportunities given to him.  The Appellant 
had raised a contention of bias against the Lok Ayukta himself.  The said 
contention as also the other contentions raised by the Appellant was dealt 
with by the Lok Ayukta in his report dated 13.11.1998 holding him guilty of 
both the charges :
</p>
<p id="p_9">	"29.  In the above circumstances, both the charges 
stand fully proved that the documents mentioned in 
Annexure 1 to the chargesheet were recovered from the 
almirah of Shri Sheo Shanker Lal Srivastava, Shri Sheo 
Shanker Lal Srivastava did not give thekey to the Lok 
Ayukta when he demanded the same from him and with 
great annoyance, using indecent language said in a fit of 
anger that he will not give the keys and that he should be 
suspended."
</p>  

<p id="p_10">	He was served with a second show cause in regard to quantum of 
punishment.  In his second show cause notice, the Appellant again raised the 
question of non-compliance of the principles of natural justice including bias 
on the part of the Lok Ayukta, stating :
</p>

<p id="p_11">	"Therefore, it is very humbly requested that your 
honour may be kind enough to set aside the 
implementation of the proposed punishment and in this 
connection, if your honour is still willing to take further 
steps in the matter then it is humbly prayed that you may 
set aside the whole inquiry proceedings and may frame 
the chargesheet afresh and then may, kindly, refer the 
matter to His Excellency the Governor or to the State 
Government for appointing an Inquiry Officer so that the 
applicant may be able to defend himself by cross-
examining the witnesses concerned including your 
honour without fear before an impartial Inquiry Officer."  
</p>		
<p id="p_12">By reason of an order dated 03.12.1998, the Appellant was directed to 
be removed from service but taking a compassionate view, he was awarded 
maximum compassionate allowance in terms of C.S.R. 353.  In his order, the 
Lok Ayukta recorded :
</p>	
<p id="p_13">"Documents pending disposal for years were found 
in his almirah.  It means that he does not want to work by 
nature.  In the same manner, he did not misbehave in the 
heat of the moment, but because it is his nature.  Desiring 
to look in his almirah or requesting him to give its keys 
was not a mater on which he would have been enraged.   
In all his clarifications, he has stated that the Lokayukta 
is biased against him and favours another officer while 
no other officer has any role to play in this connection.  
He has particularly reiterated in his petition before 
Hon'ble High Court that an inquiry should be launched 
against the Lokayukta  for his misbehaviour and 
incapacity and that the Lokayukta starts proceedings on 
the asking of a particular officer.  In his reply also while 
showing cause against the punishment, he has said 
nothing new and has again stated that because of the 
personal bias against the delinquent and the liking for 
another officer, the Lokayukta is unfairly trying to scuttle 
the defence of the delinquent in such a manner as if he is 
preparing his own affidavit against the clarifications of 
the charged officer.  If somebody would have committed 
such an act in the heat of the moment then he would 
raised this point in order to get the punishment reduced 
and would not have persisted on leveling unnecessary 
charges like this, while the act of leveling of these had no 
special impact on the charges against the delinquent."   
</p>
<p id="p_14">On or about 05.02.1999, the Appellant filed a writ petition before the 
High Court.  In its judgment and order dated 20.03.2001, the High Court 
opined :
</p>
<p id="p_15">"We are of the view, that the Lok Ayukta instead 
of removing the petitioner from service should have 
passed an order retiring the petitioner from service.  No 
doubt Lok Ayukta has taken very compassionate view of 
the matter in relation to the petitioner by directing that 
the petitioner will be paid the maximum compassionate 
allowance as admissible under Rule 353.  But 
considering the facts and circumstances of the case, we 
are of the view that the order of removal passed against 
the petitioner, may be treated as an order of compulsory 
retirement from service from the date of the removal of 
the petitioner.  We have taken this view only for the 
reason that the order of punishment imposed upon the 
petitioner, does not commensurate with the gravity of the 
charges.  The charge against the petitioner for keeping 
the necessary files in his almirah and misbehaving 
against the Lok Ayukta no doubt amounts to an 
unbecoming act, but the question which calls for 
consideration is that against such an act of misconduct, 
whether a persons should be removed from service.  We 
are of the view that justice would have met, if the 
petitioner retired from service compassionately from the 
date the order of removal was passed against the 
petitioner, and he may be given the salary and allowance, 
during the period, he remained under suspension."       
</p>
<p id="p_16">These appeals have been preferred by the Appellant as also by the 
State.
</p>
<p id="p_17">Mr. Pramod Swarup, the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the 
Appellant, in support of Civil Appeal No.7359 of 2003, would submit that 
the Lok Ayukta himself being a witness to the occurrence could not have 
taken over the disciplinary proceeding himself.  Mr. Swarup urged that it 
would be evident from the records of the case that the Lok Ayukta made up 
his mind from the very  beginning and in that view of the matter the order of 
punishment passed by him is not sustainable.  Our attention was further 
drawn to the fact that in the show cause notice dated 13.11.1998, the Lok 
Ayukta had directed the Appellant to show cause as to why on account of his 
conduct narrated in the charges, he should not be dismissed from services.  It 
was further submitted that as the principles of natural justice were required 
to be complied with,  it was obligatory on the part of the Lok Ayukta to get 
the departmental proceedings conducted by some other officer. 
</p>
<p id="p_18">The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the State, on the other 
hand, submitted that as the charges against the Appellant were proved, the 
High Court committed an illegality in interfering with the quantum of 
punishment.
</p>  
<p id="p_19">The Lok Ayukta was running a small office.  The Appellant was the 
Private Secretary of the organization.  Inspection of the files of the almirah 
kept in the Appellant's office became necessary as letters had been received 
from different departments as also reminders thereof, but he instead of bring 
the same to the notice of Lok Ayukta, was keeping them in the almirah.  
Upon inspection, 124 old letters of other departments were found in the 
almirah of an Assistant and 107 letters relating to other Assistant were found 
in torn condition from heap of waste papers outside the office. 
</p>
<p id="p_20">A practice was started in the office of the Lok Ayukta that no almirah 
should be kept under lock and key so as to enable the Lok Ayukta to check 
up the pending files.  Despite having been requested  to open his almirah, the 
Appellant not only refused to do so but also used indecent language.  He 
even refused to hand over the keys and shouted at the top of his voice that he 
might be suspended but he would not give the keys.  In his show cause, the 
Appellant did not deny recovery of the documents from the almirah.  He, 
however, denied the charge relating to not handing over the keys of the 
almirah or use of the indecent language.  Only one witness viz. Shri Upreti, 
who witnessed the entire incident, was examined. He, as noticed 
hereinbefore, was not cross-examined by the Appellant.  He merely 
requested that he should be given a few days time to cross-examine the said 
witness. His said request was rightly rejected, as he did not assign any 
reason therefore.  The statements of the said witness, therefore, having not 
been controverted would be deemed to be admitted. 
</p>
<p id="p_21">It is not in dispute that the Lok Ayukta was the disciplinary authority.  
The power to impose punishment on the Appellant vested only in him.  
When the Lok Ayukta appointed one Shri S.K. Arora, a retired Director of 
Defence Estate, an objection thereto was taken by the Appellant himself 
stating that no person from outside should be appointed as the  Inquiry 
Officer.  In the aforementioned situation, the Lok Ayukta had no other 
option but to take upon himself the burden of holding the departmental 
proceedings.  The appellant, therefore, cannot be permitted to raise any 
contention that the disciplinary proceeding should have been conducted by 
some other officer.  It has not been contended that any other officer working 
in the office of Lok Ayukta was available for conducting such enquiry.     
</p>
<p id="p_22">It is true that the principle of natural justice is based on two pillars : (i) 
nobody shall be condemned without hearing; and (ii) nobody shall be a 
judge in his own cause.  
</p>
<p id="p_23">It is, however,  well known that the principles of natural justice can be 
excluded by a statute.  It can also be waived.  
</p>
<p id="p_24">In a case where doctrine of necessity is applicable compliance of the 
principles of natural justice would be excluded.  
</p>
<p id="p_25">Referring to the doctrine of necessity, Sir William Wade in his 
Administrative Law stated :
</p>	
<p id="p_26">"But there are many cases where no substitution is 
possible, since no one else is empowered to act.  Natural 
justice then has to give way to necessity, for otherwise 
there is no means of deciding and the machinery of 
justice or administration will break down,."
</p>
<p id="p_27">It was further stated :
</p>
      
<p id="p_28">"In administrative cases the same exigency may 
arise.  Where statute empowers particular minister or 
official to act, he will usually be the one and only person 
who can do so.  There is then no way of escaping the 
responsibility, even if he is personally interested.  
Transfer of responsibility is, indeed, a recognized type of 
ultra vires.  In one case it was unsuccessfully argued that 
only minister competent to confirm a compulsory 
purchase order for land for an airport had disqualified 
himself by showing bias and that the local authority 
could only apply for a local Act of Parliament."  
</p>

<p id="p_29"><a href="/doc/192242103/" id="a_1">In M.P. State  Police Establishment v. State of M.P. and Others</a>  
[(2004) 8 SCC 788], a Constitution Bench of this Court observed that the as 
office of the Lok Ayukta is held by a former Judge of this Court, it would be 
difficult to assume that such authority would give a report without any 
material whatsoever.  Although no law was laid down in this behalf, but, 
evidently those observations are pointers to show that normally a report from 
such a high officer should not be disbelieved.
</p>
<p id="p_30">It is not that the Lok Ayukta was not inclined to get the matter 
inquired into by an outsider.  He appointed one Shri S.K. Arora.  It is the 
Appellant himself who raised an objection thereagainst.  He categorically 
stated that no outsider should be appointed as an Inquiry Officer although he 
took a different stand in his first show cause.   He, therefore, waived his 
right.  [<a href="/doc/80596/" id="a_2">See Manak Lal v. Dr. Prem Chand</a>  [(1957) SCR   575 at 581]  

In the aforementioned situation, the Lok Ayukta had no other option 
but to proceed with the inquiry.  Despite the fact that he was the disciplinary 
authority himself, as well as a witness, he had no other option but to inquire 
into the charges against the Appellant.  Furthermore the Appellant did not 
deny or dispute, as noticed hereinbefore, the recovery of the documents from 
the almirah.  In that view of the matter, it was for the Appellant, who had 
knowledge about the documents  and which had been kept by him in the 
almirah, to show that as to how he had dealt with the same. He being the 
Private Secretary was a man of confidence.  He was bound to follow the 
prevailing practice.  It was his duty to place all the complaints and letters 
received from other departments before the Lok Ayukta.  The office of a 
Lok Ayukta is of great importance. People approach Lok Ayukta with 
various grievances.  They require urgent enquiry.  It is not difficult to 
presume that only because such complaints were received, a practice 
developed that no almirah should kept under lock and key.  The Appellant 
must be presumed to have knowledge thereabout.   Despite the same he had 
put his almirah under lock and key.  He refused to hand over the key when 
called upon to do so.  He did not cross-examine the only witness who was 
available.  He also did not examine himself.  He did not examine any 
defence witness.  He did not show any remorse and in that view of the 
matter, in the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case, we are of the 
opinion that it cannot be said that the order of punishment passed by the Lok 
Ayukta suffered from any infirmity.  
</p>
<p id="p_31">Presumably in this view of the matter alone, the High Court did not go 
into the questions in details.  In fact from the impugned judgment it does not 
appear that the arguments which have been advanced before us  were in fact 
pressed.

<p id="p_32">The High Court while accepting that the appellant was rightly held to 
be guilty of the charges of misconduct, therefore, committed a manifest error 
in interfering with the quantum of punishment.
</p>
<p id="p_33">It is now well-settled that principles of law that the High Court or the 
Tribunal in exercise of its power of judicial review would not normally 
interfere with the quantum of  punishment.  Doctrine of proportionality can 
be invoked only under certain situations.  It is now well-settled that the High 
Court shall be very slow in interfering with the quantum of punishment,  
unless it is found to be shocking to one's conscience.

<p id="p_34"><a href="/doc/27422/" id="a_3">In V. Ramana v. S.P. SRTC and Others</a> [(2005) 7 SCC 338], this 
Court upon referring to a large number of decisions held :
</p>
<p id="p_35">"The common thread running through in all these 
decisions is that the Court should not interfere with the 
administrator's decision unless it was illogical or suffers 
from procedural impropriety or was shocking to the 
conscience of the Court, in the sense that it was in 
defiance of logic or moral standards. In view of what has 
been stated in the Wednesbury's case (supra) the Court 
would not go into the correctness of the choice made by 
the administrator open to him and the Court should not 
substitute its decision to that of the administrator. The 
scope of judicial review is limited to the deficiency in 
decision-making process and not the decision."

<p id="p_37">While saying so, we are not oblivious of the fact that the doctrine of 
unreasonableness is giving way to the doctrine of proportionality.  
</p>
<p id="p_38">It is interesting to note that the Wednesbury principles may not now 
be held to be applicable in view of the development in constitutional law in 
this behalf.  [See e.g. <a href="/doc/1007347/" id="a_5">Huang and Others v. Secretary of State</a> for the Home 
Department  [(2005) 3 All. ER 435], wherein referring to <a href="/doc/861688/" id="a_6">R. v. Secretary of 
State of the Home Department</a>, ex. P Daly [(2001) 3 All ER 433], it was 
held that in certain cases, the adjudicator may require to conduct a judicial 
exercise which is not merely more intrusive than Wednesbury, but involves 
a full-blown merits judgment, which is yet more  than Ex p. Daly requires on 
a judicial review where the court has to decide a proportionality issue.      	
</p>	
<p id="p_39">For the reasons aforementioned, we are of the opinion that there is no 
merit in Civil Appeal No.7359 of 2003, which is dismissed and Civil Appeal 
No.7358 is allowed.  No costs.
