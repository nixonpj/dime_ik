THE HONBLE SRI JUSTICE CHALLA KODANDA RAM            

WRIT PETITION NO.5594 of 2007   


ORDER:  
</pre>
<p id="p_1">      The petitioners filed this writ petition for issuance of writ of
Mandamus declaring the action of the respondents in not regularizing their
occupation of the land in Sy.No.15, Mothukupalli Village and Sy.No.1,
Domala Madaram Village, Malhar Rao Mandal, Karimnagar District, and  
threatening to evict them, as arbitrary and illegal.
</p><p id="p_2">      There are 234 petitioners in the writ petition. As per the averments
in the affidavit filed in support of the writ petition, all the petitioners
belong to SC, ST and BC communities and are eking out their livelihood
through agriculture. They assert that they are in occupation of Ac.600 in
Sy.No.15 of Mothukupalli Village and Sy.No.1 of Domala Madaram Village 
in Malhar Rao Mandal for more than three and half decades. Their
forefathers belong to the said two villages, which are forest villages. They
abandoned the villages a few decades ago after an outbreak of cholera
and migrated to Edlapalli, which is neighbouring village, and started
cultivation in the above mentioned lands. The petitioners made
representations dated 11.09.2006, 17.11.2006 and 11.12.2006 to the 2nd
respondent-District Collector seeking to regularize their occupation of the
land in the respective Survey numbers and to grant pattas in their favour.
The petitioners assert that in view of Circular No.13-1/90  FP(1) dated
18.09.1990 issued by the Government of India, Ministry of Environment,
Forests &amp; Wildlife, declaring that the encroachers in the Government and
Forest lands are entitled for regularization and no action need be taken to
evict them, they are entitled to be granted pattas.
</p><p id="p_3">      This Court on 16.04.2007 directed the learned Government Pleader
to file a status repot touching upon the claims of the petitioners as to the
possession over the land in question. Thereafter on 23.04.2007 this Court
while observing that the respondents have filed counter affidavits
disputing the claim of the petitioners, asserting that none of the
petitioners are in possession of the forest land, specifically directed the
District Collector and District Superintendent of Police, Karimnagar, to visit
the spot personally or to depute the officers of the concerned division,
and file a report reflecting the state of affairs as to the possession or
otherwise over the land in question. On 11.10.2007 the report came to be
filed before this Court. Thereafter the writ petition was admitted on
2.11.2007 and interim direction was granted in W.P.M.P.No.7127 of 2007
directing the parties to maintain status quo with regard to the possession
of the land in question.
</p><p id="p_4">      Smt. Vasudha Nagaraj, learned counsel appearing for the
petitioners by drawing attention of this Court to the panchanama dated
30.11.2005, would submit that the panchanama itself would prove the
possession of the petitioners over the land in question and no further
evidence as such is required. She also submits that even before filing of
the writ petition, in 2006 itself representations have been made for
regularization, and further, the fact that in 2005 and 2006 forest offence
cases came to be filed against certain of the individuals would leave no
manner of doubt that at least some of the petitioners are in possession of
the land. Ultimately, she would urge that considering the fact that the
petitioners are in possession and enjoyment of the land in question by
cultivating the same and their social status and financial inability to
protect themselves, even if they are required to be evicted the respondent
authorities may be directed to follow the due procedure prescribed under
Section 20 (4) of the A.P. Forest Act, 1967.
</p><p id="p_5">      On the other hand, Smt. Pramada, learned Government Pleader
vehemently opposes for granting of such relief. She submits that the land
in question admeasuring Ac.4319 in Sy.No.1 of Domalamadaram Village   
and Ac.1923  in Sy.No.15 of Mothukupally Village was notified as
Tadicherla Reserve Forest under Section 18 of the Hyderabad Forest Act,
1326 Fasli vide G.O.No.1144, dated 24.12.1354 Fasli and published in
Gazette No.2, dated 10.01.1355 Fasli. She further submits that none of
the petitioners are in possession of the land except 14 individuals in an
extent of Ac.36.07 in Sy.No.1 of Domala Madaram Village. As a matter of
fact, when certain individuals tried to occupy the forest land by cutting the
forest growth, Forest Offence Cases have been booked against them on 
30.11.2005. She further submits that the prayer of the petitioners in the
writ petition for grant of pattas by regularizing the alleged occupation of
the petitioners cannot be granted, as the subject land is a reserve forest
and Circular dated 18.09.1990 referred to above by the petitioners, is
contrary to the provisions of the A.P. Forest Act, 1967, and hence, no
pattas can be granted in favour of anyone, except the eligible persons
under Scheduled Tribes and <a href="/doc/121302/" id="a_1">Other Traditional Forest Dwellers
(Recognition of Forest Rights) Act</a>, 2006.
</p><p id="p_6">      Heard learned counsel for the petitioners and learned Government
Pleader for respondents.
</p><p id="p_7">      Though the learned counsel for the petitioners pleaded for
regularization of the petitioners alleged occupation, ultimately she
confined her argument to the one that the petitioners shall not be
dispossessed without following due process of law, particularly under
Section 20(4) of the A.P. Forest Act, 1967.
</p><p id="p_8">      It may be noted that there are 234 petitioners claiming themselves
to be in occupation of the land in Sy.No.15 of Mothukupalli Village and
Sy.No.1 of Domala Madaram Village, but no specific boundaries of the
area, or specific extents in which each of them alleged to be in
occupation,  was stated in the writ petition. Except the assertion that they
are in occupation of the land in question, there is no prima facie material
before this Court to come to a conclusion that the petitioners are in
occupation of the land in question.
</p><p id="p_9">      On the other hand, the assertion of the respondents in the counter
affidavit and the documents filed in support of the same, reveal that there
was concerted effort by the individuals to destroy the forest growth for
the purpose of cultivation. Even assuming that some of the petitioners are
the ones who were sought to be prevented from cutting the forest
growth, it cannot be said that they are in possession of the land in
question since the very entry into the forest land and the attempt to cut
the forest growth being an offence and prohibited by the Statute, and the
same cannot be used as a ruse to claim possession, and thereafter, seek
protection of land. A person, who seeks to violate law cannot seek
protection under law.
</p><p id="p_10">      In the facts of the present case, there being no material in support
of the claim of the petitioners, even the innocuous relief of the petitioners
not to evict them without following due process of law cannot be granted.
</p><p id="p_11">      Accordingly, the writ petition is dismissed. As a sequel, pending
miscellaneous petitions, if any, shall stand closed. No order as to costs.
