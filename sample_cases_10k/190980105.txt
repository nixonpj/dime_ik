             (SURENDRA SINGH Vs THE STATE OF MADHYA PRADESH)


16-09-2015

Shri Neeraj Nahar, learned counsel for the applicants.
Shri Ramesh Kushwaha, learned Panel Lawyer for the respondent-</pre>
<p id="p_1">State.
</p><p id="p_2">Heard arguments.
</p><p id="p_3">Perused case diary and material on record.
</p><p id="p_4">This is the first bail application filed by the applicants under
<a href="/doc/1783708/" id="a_1">Section 438</a> of Cr.P.C for grant of anticipatory bail as they
apprehend their arrests in connection with Crime No.79/2015
registered at Police Station Gadimalahra, District Chhatarpur,
against them for the offences punishable under <a href="/doc/1011035/" id="a_2">Sections 323</a>, <a href="/doc/594493/" id="a_3">294</a>,
<a href="/doc/180217/" id="a_4">506</a> and <a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_5">34</a> of the IPC and 3(1)(x) of the Scheduled Castes and the
<a href="/doc/25085007/" id="a_6">Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act</a>, 1989 (for short,
âthe Actâ).
</p><p id="p_5">Prosecution allegations are that on 31.5.2015 at about 8:30 pm,
informant Kishanlal Ahirwar was standing before a shop in village
Nivari. At that time, the applicants had asked for interest on the
loan given by them saying âChamra tu byaj ke paise kyo nahi
detaâ. Thereafter, the applicants committed marpeet with him
with kicks and fists.
</p><p id="p_6">Learned counsel for the applicants submits that the genesis of
quarrel between the applicants and the informant is a dispute over
payment of interest upon a loan which the informant has taken
from them. Hence, the alleged incident was not occurred because
the informant belongs to Scheduled Caste. Moreover, it is not the
statement of the informant in the FIR that the applicants
 humiliated him by saying âChamraâ at the time of alleged
incident. It is also submitted by him that no custodial interrogation
of the applicants are required in the case. It is also submitted by
him that the injuries sustained by the informant are of minor in
nature. It is also submitted by him that the applicants are
permanent residents of village Nivari and they do not have any
criminal antecedents. It is also lastly submitted by him that if the
facts of the case are considered in its entirety, the provisions of
<a href="/doc/197893640/" id="a_7">Section 18</a> of the Act, which prohibits the grant of anticipatory bail,
do not apply in the case. Upon these submissions, learned counsel
prays for grant of anticipatory bail to the applicant.
Learned Panel Lawyer opposes the prayer.
</p><p id="p_7">On due consideration of the facts and circumstances of the case,
the submissions raised on behalf of the parties by their counsel
and upon perusal of the injury report of the informant, but without
expressing any opinion on the merits of the case, I am of the view
that it is a fit case to grant anticipatory bail to the applicants.
Hence, the application is allowed with certain conditions. The
applicants are directed to appear before the Investigating Officer
on or before 22.09.2015 for interrogation and submission of
documentary proofs of their permanent residence and contact
numbers, if any. The Investigating Officer is ordered that if he
arrests the applicants in the aforesaid crime, they be released
immediately on bail on their furnishing âeachâ a personal
bond in the sum of Rs.25,000/- (Rupees Twenty Five
Thousand only) with one solvent surety in like amount to
his satisfaction. Further, applicants are directed to abide by the
conditions enumerated in <a href="/doc/1692057/" id="a_8">Section 438(2)</a> of the Cr.P.C. It is made
 clear that if the applicants fail to appear before the Investigating
Officer on the stipulated period, then this bail order shall stand
automatically cancelled.
</p><p id="p_8">It is also made clear that the trial court shall not be influenced by
any observations made by this Court in this order while framing
the charge.
</p><p id="p_9">C. C. as per rules.
</p>
