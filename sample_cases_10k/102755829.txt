<p id="p_1">       Rule returnable forthwith. Mr.Pandya, the learned APP

<p id="p_2">       The present application is filed under <a href="/doc/1290514/" id="a_1">Section 439</a> of the
Code    of   Criminal    Procedure,     1973,   for   regular   bail   in

        The learned APP appearing on behalf of the respondent-
State has opposed grant of regular bail looking to the nature
and gravity of the offence.
</p>

<p id="p_5">        The learned advocates appearing on behalf of the
respective parties do not press for further reasoned order.
</p>

<p id="p_6">        I have heard the learned advocates appearing on behalf
of the respective parties and perused the papers of the
investigation and considered the allegations levelled against
the applicant and the role played by the applicant. I have also
taken into consideration the following aspects :
</p>

<p id="p_7">        The applicant-accused aged 22 years had an affair with
the victim aged 16 years. It appears from the statement of the
victim that she was in love with the applicant and had
accompanied the applicant on her own free will and volition.
</p>

<p id="p_8">        I am told that the victim has got married with one
another boy and she is at her matrimonial home.
</p>

<p id="p_9">        This Court has also taken into consideration the law laid
down by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of <a href="/doc/1563495/" id="a_6">Sanjay Chandra
v. Central Bureau of Investigation</a>, reported in [2012]1 SCC 40.
</p>

<p id="p_10">        In    the    facts   and   circumstances   of   the   case    and
considering the nature of the allegations made against the
applicant in the FIR, without discussing the evidence in detail,
prima facie, this Court is of the opinion that this is a fit case to
exercise the discretion and enlarge the applicant on regular
bail.
