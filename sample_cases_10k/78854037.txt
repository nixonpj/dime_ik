</pre><p id="p_1">1.     Rule DB.
</p><p id="p_2">2.     With the consent of the parties, the writ petition is set down for final
       hearing and disposal.
</p><p id="p_3">3.     Challenge in this writ petition is to the order passed by the Central
       Administrative Tribunal dated 15.10.2014.
</p><p id="p_4">4.     The respondents had joined the Income Tax Department at Chennai
       and Kerela in the year 2008. One of the respondents had joined the
       Department in the year 2010. The respondents were thereafter at their
       request transferred to the Delhi Zone. Since the Department failed to
       count their past service rendered in the earlier zone of allocation for
       the purpose of promotion to the post of Income Tax Officer (ITO)
       Group „B‟, the respondents approached the Central Administrative
       Tribunal (hereinafter referred to as Tribunal). The respondents before
       the Tribunal (petitioner herein) relied on a notification dated

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">W.P.(C) 6368/2015                                                   Page 1 of 6</span>
       24.03.2005, more particularly, Clause 2 Note-I Sub Clause (2) to
      justify their action. The relevant portion of the notification reads as
      under :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">                "(2) For the purpose of reckoning three years‟ regular
                service in the grade, the service rendered by an inter-
                region transferee in the old region shall not be counted
                in the new region which he has joined on such transfer,
                if the transfer is on the request of the officer concerned."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_5">      As per the notification for the purpose of reckoning three years
      regular service in the grade the service rendered by an inter region
      transferee was not to be counted in the new region, if such a transfer
      was made at the request of the officer.
</p><p id="p_6">5.    The respondents herein had argued before the Tribunal that their case
      was fully covered by various decisions of the Hon‟ble Supreme Court
      of India.
</p><p id="p_7">6.    Today, the learned counsel for the parties are in agreement that
      identical orders passed by two Tribunals being Jodhpur Bench and
      Guwahati Bench have attained finality, OAs stand allowed and writ
      petitions filed stand dismissed.
</p><p id="p_8">7.    Ms. Bansal has however clarified that the Department is
      contemplating filing special leave petitions.
</p><p id="p_9">8.    We have heard the learned counsel for the parties.
</p><p id="p_10">9.    The controversy at hand in our view stands fully settled by the
      decisions rendered by the Hon‟ble Supreme Court of India and also
      by various Courts as detailed below :

<blockquote id="blockquote_2">              "..............The appellants contended that, since the
             respondent had been transferred on compassionate
             ground, on his own request to the post of Storekeeper at
             Cochin and was placed at the bottom of the Seniority
             list, the period of 3 years of regular service can be
             treated to commence only from the date on which he was
             transferred to Cochin. This is obviously fallacious
             inasmuch as the respondent had already acquired the
             status of a permanent employee at Pune where he had
             rendered more than 3 years of service as a Storekeeper.
             Even if an employee is transferred at his own request,
             from one place to another, on the same post, the period
             of service rendered by him at the earlier place where he
             held a permanent post and had acquired permanent
             status, cannot be excluded from consideration for
             determining his eligibility for promotion, though he may
             have been placed at the bottom of the seniority list at the
             transferred place. Eligibility for promotion cannot be
             confused with seniority as they are two different and
             distinct factors."</blockquote>


<p id="p_12">            In the case of Renu Mullick Vs. Union of India and Anr.,
      (1994) 1 SCC 373, the Hon‟ble Supreme Court held in para 10 that :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">             "...........The transferee is to be treated as a new entrant
             in the collectorate to which he is transferred for the
             purpose of seniority. It means that the appellant would
             come up for consideration for promotion as per her turn
             in the seniority list in the transferee unit and only if she
             has put in 2 years' service in the category of UDC. But
             when she is so considered, her past service in the
             previous collectorate cannot be ignored for the purpose
             of determining her eligibility as per Rule 4 aforesaid.
             Her seniority in the previous collectorate is taken away
             for the purpose of counting her seniority in the new
             charge but that has no relevance for judging her
             eligibility for promotion under Rule 4 which is a

              statutory rule. The eligibility for promotion has to be
             determined with reference to Rule 4 alone, which
             prescribes the criteria for eligibility. There is no other
             way of reading the instructions aforementioned. If the
             instructions are read the way the Tribunal has done, it
             may be open to challenge on the ground of
             arbitrariness.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">            Similar view was expressed in Union of India and Anr. Vs. V.
</blockquote><p id="p_13">      N. Bhat, 2003 (9) SCALE 517, wherein it has been held by the
      Hon‟ble Supreme Court in para 4 that :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_5">             "...........The question which, therefore, arises for
             consideration is as to whether the period of service
             rendered by the respondent in the Ministry of Defence
             should be wiped off for all purposes? The well settled
             principle of law that even in the case where the transfer
             has been allowed on request, the concerned employee
             merely loses his seniority, but the same by itself would
             not lead to a conclusion that he should be deprived of
             the other benefits including his experience and eligibility
             for promotion. In terms of the Schemes aforementioned,
             promotion is to be granted for avoiding stagnation only
             within the said parties. The said Schemes have been
             framed because they are beneficial ones and thus
             required to be implemented. The Scheme merely perused
             that any person having rendered 16/26 years of service
             without obtaining any promotion could be entitled to the
             benefit therefor. It is, therefore, not a case where
             promotion to the higher post is to be made only on the
             basis of seniority. Even in a case where the promotion is
             to be made on the selection basis, the concerned
             employee, even if he be placed at the bottom of the
             seniority list in terms of the order of transfer based in
             his favour, he cannot be deprived of being considered
             for promotion to the next higher post if he is eligible
             therefor."

<blockquote id="blockquote_6">             Again, the Hon‟ble Supreme Court in Union of India and Ors.
</blockquote><p id="p_14">      Vs. C. N. Ponnappan, (1996) 1 SCC 524 in para 4 held that :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_7">             "..........The service rendered by an employee at the
             place from where he was transferred on compassionate
             grounds is regular service. It is no different from the
             service rendered at the place where he is transferred.
             Both the periods are taken into account for the purpose
             of leave and retrial benefits. The fact that as a result of
             transfer he is placed at the bottom of the seniority list at
             the place of transfer does not wipe out his service at the
             place from where he was transferred. The said service,
             being regular service in the grade, has to be taken into
             account as part of his experience for the purpose of
             eligibility for promotion and it cannot be ignored only
             on the ground that it was not rendered at the place
             where he has been transferred. In our opinion, the
             Tribunal has rightly held that the service held at the
             place from where the employee has been transferred has
             to be counted as experience for the purpose of eligibility
             for promotion at the place where he has been
             transferred."

<blockquote id="blockquote_8">            Hon‟ble High Court of Rajasthan at Jodhpur Bench in D. B.
</blockquote><p id="p_15">      Civil W.P. No. 5148/2013 passed on 26.05.2015 in Union of India
      Vs. Ramesh Kumar Panwar &amp; Anr. held in para 8 that :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_9">             ".........A reading and perusal of Annex.9 dated
             14.05.1990 shows that a person on his transfer would
             not be entitled to maintain his seniority from the old
             charge and that he would be placed at the bottom of the
             list. A further reading of the said circular shows that on
             a transfer, the transferee will forfeit all claims for
             promotion/confirmation in the old charge. However, the
             said circular does not stipulate that on a transfer, the
             transferee would lose his length of service as well. As in
             the present case, the respondent herein lost his seniority,

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">W.P.(C) 6368/2015                                                   Page 5 of 6</span>
              he would not lose the length of service and the length of
             service would be counted from the date of initial
             appointment. The argument raised by the petitioner that
             the applicant had not rendered service three years
             continuous service on the post of Tax Assistant in
             Rajasthan Region, is wholly fallacious and is hereby
             rejected. It has to be kept in mind that there is no
             discontinuation of service of the respondent as a Tax
             Assistant. There is only a change in the Division. The
             recruitment rules do not bar the applicant-respondent
             from promotion and the regular service of the applicant
             is to be counted from the date of initial
             appointment.........."

<p id="p_16">10.   Having regard to the settled position of law, we find that there is no
      infirmity in the judgment rendered by the Tribunal.         The service
      rendered by the respondents in their earlier zone is to be treated as
      service rendered for the purpose of promotion. Accordingly the writ
      petition is dismissed. No costs.
