<p id="p_3">                          Daughter of the informant is said to have been

          kidnapped by the appellant and two named accused persons who

          took her to Samastipur Railway Station and handed over to

          Pappu Sharma in the train and Pappu Sharma took her to Punjab

          and committed rape against her in his house. However, she any

          how managed to escape.
</p>
<p id="p_4">                          It is submitted by learned counsel for the appellants

          that no such occurrence as alleged ever took place. They have

          been falsely implicated in this case due to land dispute. They

          happen to be member of scheduled caste community. They

          never kidnapped the victim rather the victim suo motu eloped

          with Pappu Sharma and went to Punjab where the parents of the

          Pappu Sharma chided and assaulted them for taking the girl by

          him. Thereafter, she was dropped by Pappu Sharma at the

          Samastipur Railway Station. The allegation levelled against the

          appellants is not specific rather general and omnibus in nature.

          They have been languishing in custody since 29.05.2019.

          Hence, they may be enlarged on bail.

<p id="p_5">                          On the other hand, learned Special P.P. for the State

          vehemently opposing the bail petition submitted that the victim

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                                         3/3</span>




                      in her statement made under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_12">Section 164</a> Cr.P.C. has stated that

                      the appellants along with two other accused persons kidnapped

                      her and handed over to Pappu Sharma at Samastipur Railway

                      Station who took her to Punjab. Hence, the appellants do not

                      deserve bail.
</p>
<p id="p_6">                                      In the facts and circumstances of the case, I am

                      not inclined to enlarge the appellants on bail. The prayer for

                      their bail is hereby rejected.
</p>
<p id="p_7">                                        However, the learned Trial Court is directed to

                      conclude the trial as expeditiously as possible preferably within

                      six months from the date of framing of the charge. Both the

                      parties are expected to extend their co-operation in conclusion

                      of the trial. The Superintendent of Police,            Samastipur   is

                      directed to ensure production of the witnesses in the case on

                      each and every date fixed without fail.

<p id="p_8">                                      Let a copy of this order be sent to the

                      Superintendent of Police, Samastipur for needful.

</p><p id="p_9">                                       Accordingly, this appeal is dismissed.
