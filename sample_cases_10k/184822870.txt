                               Judgment
Reportable

29/05/2019

</p><p id="p_42">1.         The Rajasthan Public Service Commission (hereinafter
referred to as the "RPSC") in these five appeals is aggrieved by a
common judgment issued by the learned Single Judge, whereby a
direction was issued to delete Question Nos.11 &amp; 22 from the
Model Question Paper for the Rajasthan Administrative Service
(RAS)   cum    Rajasthan      Tehsildar       Service          (RTS)   Preliminary
Examinations, 2018 and a consequential order directing fresh re-
evaluation in the light of the judgment.
</p>
<p id="p_43">2.         The present litigation has a chequered history. Briefly,
the RAS/RTS Examinations, 2018 were notified in 2018. The
process entails a two stage examination procedure : Preliminary
Examination, whereby the candidates are assessed on the basis of
their answers to objective multiple choice questions. After the
conclusion of the preliminary examination, results of model answer
key were published, eliciting comments and objections. The
objections received were then taken up and considered by an
expert committee set up by the RPSC, which after considering the
recommendations of the of the committee published the final
answer keys. The results published by the RPSC became the
subject-matter of controversy in two cases i.e. Jitendra Kumar
Bagaria &amp; Ors. Vs. The State of Rajasthan &amp; Anr. (SBCWP
No.25338/2018) and connected cases decided on 10.12.2018 and
the judgment in Bhanwar Lal &amp; Ors. Vs. Rajasthan Public Service
Commission &amp; Anr. (SBCWP No.17219/2018) and connected cases,
decided on 15.12.2018. Both these decisions relied upon the
parameters of judicial review -outlined in such cases, by an earlier
judgment of this Court in Ramdhan Kumawat Vs. State of
Rajasthan (SBCWP No.10622/2014) decided on 18.11.2014. The
directions in Jitendra Kumar Bagaria and Bhanwar Lal (supra) are
identical. Directions were issued for re-consideration of the correct
marking by the Expert Committee with respect to Question Paper
Nos.11 &amp; 22.

</p><p id="p_45">3.            The relevant observations with respect to two questions
and the conclusions drawn by the learned Single Judge - primarily
made in Jitendra Kumar Bagaria (supra) are as follows:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">     "In the instant case in respect of model question No.11
     the petitioners have relied upon the gazette notification
     on the website of the State of Rajasthan to contend
     that Nanak Ram did not belong to the Alwar School of
     Painting as also the publication of the Rajasthan Hindi
     Granth Academy --a government of Rajasthan entity to
     the same end, as against the books of private authors
     whose publishers have not been stated nor obviously
     approved or recognized by the State/ Central
     Government or a University/ Board. In respect of
     model question No.22, reliance by the petitioners has
     been placed on text-books published by NCERT and
     RSBSE collected by team of nationally recognized
     academic experts for the answer that Pondu and
     Odisha were also a mismatch. Yet the RPSC's experts
     have oddly contrary to the dictum of the court in
     Ramdhan Kumawat for a contrary view relied on the
     book authored by a Professor in Saharanpur in Uttar
     Pradesh and published by a publisher in Merut."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_46">4.            Accordingly, a review was directed in respect of Model
question papers No.11 &amp; 22 apart from Question Paper Nos.45,
73, 83 &amp; 101 in respect of RAS and RTS Preliminary Examinations.
The RPSC, based on the fresh recommendations of the expert
committee,      which      re-considered           the     matter,    rejected     the
petitioners' case, in effect reiterating the model keys published
earlier in respect of Question Nos 11 and 22.
</p><p id="p_47">5.            Before the learned Single Judge in the second and
latest round of litigation, the respondents (hereinafter referred to
as the "candidates") contended that the review conducted was a
mere formality because experts did not take into account specific
directions of the court and carry out an informed analysis with the
result   that    the   previous        answers        -    being     erroneous    and
demonstrably wrong in Jitendra Kumar Bagaria (supra), were
reiterated.

counter affidavit inter-alia averred as follows:-

     No.11 was also referred to reassess by the Hon'ble
     Court, by the committee of subject experts which was
     required to found by the Chairman, RPSC. That in
     pursuance of order dated 10.12.2018 RPSC constitute
     a committee consisting of five subject experts. That
     after revisiting the question No.11 the experts
     submitted their detail report on the basis of authentic
     source of Government of Rajasthan and on the basis
     of the book published by the Rajasthan Hindi Granth
     Academy and other books. That while revising the
     question No.11 expert committee given specific
     observation, that in the Alwar Museum Painting of
     Nanag Ram is available and sign of Nanag Ram is
     mentioned as dye ukux. The experts also annexed an
     information which was given by the curator
     Government Museum, Alwar. That in the expert
     report, experts given their opinion that option No.3
     "Nanak Ram"      is correct because in Alwar Style
     there was the painter namely Nanag Ram was there
     instead of Nanak Ram."

<p id="p_50">8.         It is argued on behalf of the RPSC that the Single
Bench fell into error in interfering with the determination made by
the experts. It was contended that having regard to the
judgments of the Supreme Court in Ran Vijay Singh and Ors. Vs.
State of U.P. and Ors. (2018) 2 SCC 357 and Uttar Pradesh Public
Service Commission Vs. Rahul Singh 2018 (2) SCC 357 it was not
open to the court to have exercised its discretion and direct the
deletion of entire answer-key in respect of Question No.11 &amp; 12.
Learned counsel highlighted that whether the materials taken into
account by the experts was correct and based upon publicly
available information or a view adopted by them - in turn based
upon credible material was correct, is not something that the court
could have considered.
</p><p id="p_51">9.         Counsel for the writ petitioners on the other hand
argued that the reasoning and conclusions of the Single Judge fell
within the narrow compass of judicial review permitted by the
authorities, especially where the Supreme Court has held that the
interference is not possible unless the error is manifest and the
answers    adopted and         applied       by the        examining   body   are
"demonstrably wrong". It was submitted that in this case the
model answer keys, reiterated by the expert committee not only
showed that they completely overlooked the court's directions but
also that they were as a matter of fact demonstrably wrong. The
learned Single Judge, therefore, did not act correctly within the

bounds of his jurisdiction in holding that the model answers
needed to be deleted. In support of their submission, the writ
petitioner/candidates counsel drew attention of the court to
extracts of the Rajasthan Gazette as well as the reply to the query
given by the Ajmer museum in respect of Question 11, i.e.
whether Nanak Ram is counted as a practitioner of the Alwar style
of painting.
</p><p id="p_52">Analysis &amp; Reasoning

</p><p id="p_53">10.        As is immediately apparent from the factual narrative,
the previous litigation and judgments of this Court, coupled with
the narrow challenge to the correctness of the model answer keys
adopted for the two questions, have narrowly defined the scope of
the present controversy. Before an examination of the merits,
however, it is necessary to outline the scope of judicial review
under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1">Article 226</a> in matters concerning evaluation of candidates-
particularly, for purpose of recruitment to public services. The
decisions of the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/174675/" id="a_2">Maharashtra State Board of
Secondary and Higher Secondary Education and Another v.

Ranjan Panda (2004) 13 SCC 383; and Rahul Singh (supra) have
consistently underlined that judicial review, in the absence of any
provision for revaluation, should be rarely exercised- preferably
under exceptional circumstances. For instance, a three judge
Bench of the Supreme Court, in Pramod Kumar Srivastava (supra)
held as follows:

     evaluation of his answer-book. There is a provision for
     scrutiny only wherein the answer-books are seen for the
     purpose of checking whether all the answers given by a
     candidate have been examined and whether there has been
     any mistake in the totalling of marks of each question and
     noting them correctly on the first cover page of the answer-
     book. There is no dispute that after scrutiny no mistake was
     found in the marks awarded to the appellant in the General
     Science paper. In the absence of any provision for re-
     evaluation of answer-books in the relevant rules, no
     candidate in an examination has got any right whatsoever to
     claim or ask for re- evaluation of his marks."

     383 in which the direction of the High Court for re-evaluation
     of answers books of all the examinees securing 90% or
     above marks was held to be unsustainable in law because
     the regulations of the Board of Secondary Education, Orissa,
     which conducted the examination, did not make any
     provision for re-evaluation of answers books in the rules.

<blockquote id="blockquote_22">     8. In the present case, the bye-laws of the All India Pre-

     not have allowed such re-examination or re-evaluation on
     the representation of the Respondent No. 1 and accordingly
     rejected the representation of the Respondent No. 1 for re-
     examination/re-evaluation of her answers sheets. The
     Respondent No. 1, however, approached the High Court and
     the learned Single Judge of the High Court directed
     production of answer sheets on the Respondent No. 1
     depositing a sum of Rs. 25,000/- and when the answer
     sheets were produced, the learned Single Judge himself
     compared the answers of the Respondent No. 1 with the

      the learned Single Judge that the Respondent No. 1
      deserved two additional marks for the two answers. In our
      considered opinion, neither the learned Single Judge nor the
      Division Bench of the High Court could have substituted

<p id="p_55">11.        The decision in Ran Vijay Singh (supra), which is relied

      scrutiny of an answer sheet as a matter of right, then the
      authority conducting the examination may permit it; (ii) If a

without any "inferential process of reasoning or by a process
of rationalisation" and only in rare or exceptional cases that
a material error has been committed; (iii) The Court should
not at all re-evaluate or scrutinize the answer sheets of a
candidate-it has no expertise in the matter and academic
matters are best left to academics; (iv) The Court should
presume the correctness of the key answers and proceed on
that assumption; and (v)In the event of a doubt, the benefit

candidate.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_56">31. On our part we may add that sympathy or compassion
does not play any role in the matter of directing or not
directing re-evaluation of an answer sheet. If an error is
committed by the examination authority, the complete body
of candidates suffers. The entire examination process does
not deserve to be derailed only because some candidates are
disappointed or dissatisfied or perceive some injustice having
been caused to them by an erroneous question or an
erroneous answer. All candidates suffer equally, though
some might suffer more but that cannot be helped since
mathematical precision is not always possible. This Court has
shown one way out of an impasse-exclude the suspect or
offending question.
</p>
<p id="p_57">32. It is rather unfortunate that despite several decisions of
this Court, some of which have been discussed above, there
is interference by the Courts in the result of examinations.
This places the examination authorities in an unenviable
position where they are under scrutiny and not the
candidates. Additionally, a massive and sometimes
prolonged examination exercise concludes with an air of
uncertainty. While there is no doubt that candidates put in a
tremendous effort in preparing for an examination, it must
not be forgotten that even the examination authorities put in
equally great efforts to successfully conduct an examination.
The enormity of the task might reveal some lapse at a later
stage, but the Court must consider the internal checks and
balances put in place by the examination authorities before
interfering with the efforts put in by the candidates who
have successfully participated in the examination and the
examination authorities. The present appeals are a classic
example of the consequence of such interference where
there is no finality to the result of the examinations even
after a lapse of eight years. Apart from the examination
authorities even the candidates are left wondering about the
certainty or otherwise of the result of the examination-
whether they have passed or not; whether their result will
be approved or disapproved by the Court; whether they will
get admission in a college or University or not; and whether
they will get recruited or not. This unsatisfactory situation
does not work to anybody's advantage and such a state of

      uncertainty results in confusion being worse confounded.
      The overall and larger impact of all this is that public interest
      suffers."
</p>
<p id="p_58">12.          Returning   to    the     facts     of    this      case,     the   earlier
judgments by the single judge required the experts to reconsider
the answer keys to essentially answers to two model keys:
Question Nos 11 and 22. The first, question No. 11, was whether
one of the four choices given matched with the information
available in some public sources and gazette publications. The
question was which of the four named individuals belonged to the
Alwar School of painting and the two choices which are the subject
matter of controversy are Nanak Ram and Nanag Ram. The
candidates relied upon the gazette notification on the website of
the State of Rajasthan to contend that Nanak Ram did not belong
to the Alwar School of Painting as also the publication of the
Rajasthan Hindi Granth Academy-an institution of the state of
Rajasthan entity. It was contended that reliance on books of
private authors whose publishers have not been mentioned or
recognized by the State/Central Government or a University/Board
could not be taken note of. The state, on the other hand, points
out that the Expert committee specifically elicited information
from the source, i.e. the public museum, which the petitioner
candidates had relied on and nevertheless reiterated its previous
decision.
</p><p id="p_59">13.          As far as the answer to model question No. 22 is
concerned, the candidates relied on NCERT and Rajasthan State
Board text-books collected by team of nationally recognized
academic experts for the answer that Pondu and Odisha was a
mismatch. The RPSC experts relied on the book authored by a
Professor in Saharanpur in Uttar Pradesh. The state, however,
points out that the difference in "Pondu" and "Podu" methods of
cultivation was insubstantial and mainly due to a printing error
and that the correct answer was Masha for which the matching
state is Himachal Pradesh. The experts in fact gave their reasons
for supporting their conclusions, after the previous judgment of
the court.

                                   (14 of 15)

</p><p id="p_61">14.         In this court's opinion, an error crept into the approach
and therefore, the conclusions in the impugned order. Even if-
arguendo, it were assumed that the review (or revaluation for
which there is no provision in RPSC) was correctly permitted,
nevertheless, for the court to conclude that the conclusions of the
expert body were palpably incorrect, the standard which the
Supreme Court indicated in Ran Vijay (supra) was that "the Court
may permit re-evaluation or scrutiny only if it is demonstrated
very clearly, without any "inferential process of reasoning or by a
process of rationalisation" and only in rare or exceptional cases
that a material error has been committed". The Supreme Court
also clarified that "(T)he Court should not at all re-evaluate or
scrutinize the answer sheets of a candidate-it has no expertise in
the matter and academic matters are best left to academics".
After the conclusion of the judgment in Jitendra Kumar Bagaria
(supra), the issues, including the correct answer keys to the two
concerned    questions,     were       again      referred      to    the    expert
committee, which comprised of two individuals. These individuals
did not blindly reiterate their previous opinions; they considered
the materials given and relied on by the candidate-petitioners.
Nevertheless, their conclusions have been faulted.
</p><p id="p_62">15.         A court carrying on the exercise of judicial review
merely scrutinizes the process in question- administrative or
statutory, but necessarily public in its outcome, to see if it was
arrived at in a procedurally fair and regular manner, free from
illegality, not motivated by malice or mala fides or not so
manifestly unreasonable in its conclusion that no reasonable
individual placed in that situation would arrive at such a
conclusion or so decide the matter. The impugned judgment in this
Court's opinion is clearly erroneous inasmuch as the court has
unwittingly donned the robe of the decision maker: to wit, that of
an expert, in art, in concluding that one of the choices was
defective (question No. 11) and that the RPSC's explanation about
a misprint was irrelevant, because the answer was wrongly given.
These conclusions the court cannot arrive at, as they amount to
primary decision making- a task which cannot be undertaken

                                   under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_13">Article 226.</a> The impugned judgment also overlooked the
                                   salutary rule that in the event of doubt, "the benefit ought to go
                                   to the examination authority rather than to the candidate" (Ran
                                   Vijay, supra).

                                   the appeals have to succeed. They are accordingly allowed but
                                   without order on costs.
