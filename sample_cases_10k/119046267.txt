    No.14340/2013, by the consent of the parties, the Writ Petition itself is

<p id="p_4">    3              Shri Bhandari, learned Advocate for the Petitioners, submits 

    that   the   Petitioners   who   are   the   original   Decree   Holders   in   Regular 





    Darkhast No.36/1997, had moved the applications Exhibits 16 and 20 way 

    back in the year 2004 on which the Say from the Judgment Debtors was 





    called for in March, 2005. The applications were pending. "No Say" order 

    was passed and the applications were to be heard and decided. Due to 

    inadvertence, the Decree Holders did not appear in the matter on the date 

    posted   for   arguments   and   consequentially,   on   26.11.2012   by   the 

    impugned order, the said applications were disposed of.

    4               He further submits that neither have the Petitioners neglected

    inconvenience and inadvertence that the said applications could not be 




                                                                
    argued on a particular given date. The Petitioners have been litigating for 

    a   long   time   and   the   entire   litigation   would   be   rendered   futile   if   the 




                                                               
    execution proceedings are disposed of on account of non prosecution.

<p id="p_6">    5               Shri   Narwade,   learned   Advocate   for   the   Respondents,   has 
                                  
    strenuously   supported   the   impugned   order.   His   contention   is   that   the 
                                 
    Executing  Court   cannot   be   expected   to  wait   for  the   Decree  Holders  to 

    address the Court as and when they may so desire. Since the Executing 

    Court realized that the matter was getting unduly delayed, it granted a 
       
    



    last chance to the Decree Holders on 02.11.2012. Since steps were not 

    taken,   the   applications   were   disposed   of.   He,   therefore,   prays   for   the 





    dismissal of the petition.

<p id="p_7">    6               In the alternative, Shri Narwade submits that if this Court is 





    inclined to allow this petition and set aside the impugned order, heavy 

    costs may be imposed on the Petitioners.

    sides by now have spent about 25 years in this litigation. On account of 

    the failure of the Petitioners in taking steps in relation to the applications 




                                                              
    Exhibits   16   and   20,   the   Regular   Darkhast   has   been   disposed   of.   It   is 

    apparent that by the impugned order the Petitioners are not likely to get 




                                                 
    the fruits of litigation despite having succeeded in the civil suit and the

    Darkhast No.36/1997 is restored to the  file of the  Executing Court i.e.
