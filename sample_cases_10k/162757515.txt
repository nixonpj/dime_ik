   Negligent Act".  Where the act which caused the death of a person or

  which   endangers   the   human   life   is   not   proved   to   be   a   Rash   or

  Negligent Act, the accused cannot be held to be guilty under <a href="/doc/1270101/" id="a_16">Sections

  279</a> or 304A of the <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_17">IPC</a>.  However, the terms rashness or negligence

  has   not   been   categorically   defined   in   any   statute.   The   dictionary

  meaning   of   the   term   rashness   is,   "an   act   done   without   due

  consideration", 
                  i.e. 
</p><p id="p_22">                      an act done without anticipating or caring for the
                                                                        

  result   that   may   ensue   by   the   act   done.   Whereas,   the   dictionary

  meaning of the term negligence is "  failure to exercise due degree of
                                                                        

  care   under   the  given  circumstances  which  any  reasonable  man

  would have exercised" or "failure to exercise due degree of care

  under the given circumstances which under a given situation law

  requires   to   be   exercised".  Accordingly,   both   rashness   as   well   as

  negligence are subjective concepts, and for ascertaining whether any

  particular act is rash or negligent no straight jacket formula can be

  laid   down.   Each   case   has   to   be   decided   on   the   basis   of   its   own

  peculiar   facts   and   circumstances.   Furthermore,   rashness   and

  negligence   are   pure   questions   of   facts   so   no   presumption   can   be

  raised with respect to these.   Rashness/negligence ought to be duly



FIR No. 365/00.                                                                 9 Of 14
   proved   by   the   party   who   alleges   that   the   person   endangering   the

  human life or the person who has caused the death of another person

  was acting as such.  
</p>
<p id="p_23">      It is to be seen that it is not in dispute that the offending vehicle in

  question was being driven by the accused on the relevant day as the

  accused himself has admitted this fact in his statement under <a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_18">Section

  313</a> Cr.P.C.  He has also been duly identified by the eye­witness/PW8

  Mr. Somdutt Sharma as the driver of the bus bearing no. DEP­3873.

  From the testimony of the aforementioned witness, it is also clear that

  the incident   in  question  occurred due  to collision  between the  bus

  bearing  no.  DEP­3873  being  driven by  the accused  herein and the

  scooter bearing no. DAD­4700 being driven by PW8 himself.   This

  fact also stands  established  because the testimony of PW8 remains

  uncontested on record as his cross­examination was not done by the

  accused/his counsel.  It is also not in dispute that in this unfortunate

  incident,   the   death   of   the   pillion   rider   Mr.   Kishan   Chand   Sharma

  occurred and same stands duly proved from the testimonies of PW7

  Dr. Gaurav  Aggarwal  (who conducted the postmortem of the dead

  body) and PW8 Mr. Somdutt Sharma.  So, the only thing remaining,

  although   the   most   important  ingredient,  to  be  proved  is  that  as   to


FIR No. 365/00.                                                            10 Of 14
   whether   the   accused   herein   was   driving   his   vehicle   in   a   rash   or

  negligent manner. 
</p>
<p id="p_24">      The rashness/negligence of the accused is to be culled out from

  the testimony of PW8 Mr. Somdutt Sharma only as he is the sole eye­

  witness.     The   other   material   on   record   can   only   corroborate   his

  testimony.   It has been testified by PW­8 in his statement on oath that

  on the fateful day he was driving his scooter on which the deceased

  was   sitting   as   a   pillion   rider   and   when   he   took   a   U­turn   from

  Bhajanpura Red light, while coming from Nand Nagri, the accused

  while driving the offending vehicle hit the scooter from behind due to

  which he as well as the deceased fell on the ground and the deceased

  was crushed under the right wheel of the offending vehicle.   In his

  entire   testimony   PW8   has   nowhere   stated   in   categorical   terms   the

  manner in which the accused was driving the offending vehicle and

  whether the same was rash or negligent.  The meaningful reading of

  the testimony of PW8 even do not suggest an inference to the effect

  that  the the bus was being driven at high speed, let alone it being

  driven   negligently   or   rashly.     In   fact,   no   allegation   of   any   wrong

  doing by the accused while driving the offending vehicle bearing no.

  DEP­3873   which   could   be   held   responsible   for   the   accident   in


FIR No. 365/00.                                                              11 Of 14
   question has come in this testimony of the sole eye­witness.   

      Ld. APP for the State has argued that as per PW8 when they took

  turn from the red­light Bhajanpura in the right side, the accused who

  was  driving   the   offending  vehicle  hit  the  scooter  (  on  which  both

  PW8 and deceased were riding) from back side and this fact in itself

  is sufficient to prove that the accused was rash in his driving because

  he did not care for the red­light.  
</p>
<p id="p_25">      Perusal of the site plan Ex. PW 10/D shows point 'A' as the spot

  at which the alleged accident occurred. According to the site plan, the

  accident occurred at the four­way crossing which is managed by a red

  light.  If point A is taken as the spot where the offending vehicle hit

  the scooter from the back side then it is apparent that the accident

  occurred immediately after the scooter took the U­turn.  It is not clear

  as   to   whether   Mr.   Somdutt   Sharma   was   intending   to   go   towards

  Dayalpur after turning right side from the red­light or was intending

  to  go  to  Gokal  Puri  after  taking  the  U­turn.    As  per  Mr. Somdutt

  Sharma, they took a turn from the red­light in the right side but to

  which place they were going, is not specified.   Also, as per the site

  plan it appears as if the driver of the scooter was taking a U­turn.

  Further, there is material flaw in the site plan in the sense that it is not


FIR No. 365/00.                                                        12 Of 14
    clear as to whether the red­light in question was functioning or not.

   And   if   the   same   was   functioning,   for   which   of   the   two   vehicles

   involved in the accident, same was red and for which same was green

   (   it   is   clear   that   the   light  could  not  have  been   green  for  both  the

   vehicles taking into consideration the right turn taken by the scooter).

   It shows that the investigation has not been done properly by the IO

   and several material questions remain unanswered for that reason.  

       In   these   facts,   this   Court   is   of   the   view   that   no   rashness   or

   negligence can be attributed to the accused herein.  It is possible that

   the   accused   was   driving   his   vehicle   correctly   but   the   PW8   Mr.

   Somdutt Sharma took a U­turn ignoring the red­light for him which

   might have resulted in the accident.  Although,  the possibility that the

   light  was green  for the scooter and  red for the  offending  bus  also

   cannot be ruled out but it is settled principle of criminal jurisprudence

   that if two views are possible then the one in favor of the accused is to

   be  accepted  and   it  is  for the  prosecution  to prove  its  case  beyond

   reasonable   doubt.       This  Court   is   enlightened  by   the  judgment   of

   Hon'ble   Delhi   High   Court   in   a   case   having   similar   facts   titled   as
