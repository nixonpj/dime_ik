Ajay Tewari, J (Oral)

            This appeal has been filed by the claimants/appellants for

enhancement.
</p>
<p id="p_4">            Brief facts are that on 2.12.2011 at about 8 am, the deceased

Prem Sagar along with his friend Irman Mohammad Patel was coming back

to Jind from Karnal in his car and when they reached one kilometer ahead of

village Bahari, Tehsil Assandh, the offending vehicle being driven by

respondent No.1 rashly and negligently came on wrong side and struck

against the car of the deceased. As a result of this accident, the deceased

suffered fatal injuries and died at the spot. Hence, the claim petition was

filed.
</p>
<p id="p_5">            The Tribunal held respondent No.1 responsible for causing the



                                     1 of 3
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                  ::: Downloaded on - 17-08-2018 19:39:41 :::</span>
 FAO No. 712 of 2013                                                     ::2::
</p>
<p id="p_6">accident. Monthly income of the deceased was fixed as ` 6000/- being the

minimum wages of a skilled worker, deduction of 1/3rd was made and after

applying multiplier of 12, the compensation assessed was ` 5,76,000/-. In

addition to this, a sum of ` 10,000/- was awarded towards funeral,

transportation and consortium.
</p>
<p id="p_7">             Counsel for the appellants has argued that the Tribunal has

erred in ignoring the income tax returns on completely untenable grounds.

ITRs were brought into evidence by the officials of the Income Tax

Department. They were all properly signed even by the assessing officer,

while contrary finding has been given by the Tribunal.

</p><p id="p_8">             I find that the ITRs were correct in all respect. As per the last

income tax return which was signed by the assessing officer on 29.7.2011,

income of the deceased was approximately ` 12,000/- per month. Counsel

for the Insurance Company is not in a position to deny this.            In the

circumstances, income of the deceased is taken to be ` 11,500/- per month

instead of ` 6,000/-.
</p>
<p id="p_9">             Counsel for the appellants has further argued that as per the

decision of the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/837924/" id="a_1">Sarla Verma and others            vs    Delhi

Transport Corporation and another</a>, AIR 2009 (SC) 3104, multiplier should

be 13 instead of 12.      Counsel for the Insurance Company is not in a

position to deny this also.   Consequently, I direct that multiplier of 13 be

applied in this case.
</p>
<p id="p_10">             Counsel for the appellants has further argued that in view of the

judgment of the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/74988840/" id="a_2">National Insurance Company Limited vs

Pranay Sethi and others</a>, 2017(4) RCR (Civil) 1009, future prospects of 25%

had to be awarded, and that under the conventional heads, a sum of `


                                      2 of 3
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                   ::: Downloaded on - 17-08-2018 19:39:45 :::</span>
 FAO No. 712 of 2013                                                     ::3::
</p>
<p id="p_11">60,000/- more should be awarded since only a sum of ` 10,000/- has been

awarded by the Tribunal.       Counsel for the Insurance Company accepts this

also. Consequently, I award 25% as future prospects and ` 60,000/- more

under the conventional heads.
</p>
<p id="p_12">               Counsel for the Insurance Company, however, points out that

the interest of 9% awarded by the Tribunal is too excessive.       Counsel for

the appellants does not dispute this.           Consequently, I direct that the

enhanced amount would carry rate of interest 7.5% pa from the date of

claim application till the date of payment.

</p><p id="p_13">               I further find that both the children were major and there is no

justification for putting the money in a fixed deposit. I direct that the entire

amount awarded by the Tribunal be released to the claimants and the entire

enhanced amount be given to appellant No.1.

</p><p id="p_14">               With this modification in the Award, this appeal stands

disposed of.
</p>
<p id="p_15">               Since the main case has been decided, the pending C.Ms, if

any, also stand disposed of.</p><pre id="pre_2">
