<p id="p_1">13   24-06-2013            The Petitioners, who are the elder brother-in-law and

                  sister-in-law of the Opposite Party No.2, seek quashing of the

                  order dated 5.1.2009, so far as it relates to them, passed by the

                  Judicial Magistrate, 1st class, Dalsinghsarai, by which he has taken

                  cognizance under <a href="/doc/538436/" id="a_1">Sections 498A</a>, <a href="/doc/1011035/" id="a_2">323</a> and <a href="/doc/1101188/" id="a_3">379</a> I.P.C. in

                  C.R.No.288 of 2008 corresponding to Trial No.1424 of 2009.

</p><p id="p_2">                           It appears that initially a First Information Report was

                  instituted which ended in final report, but in the meanwhile a

                  protest petition was filed, which was treated as a complaint

                  petition and the case proceeded on the same.

             brother of Petitioner No.1 on 10.3.2003 in which various gifts

             were given to the in-laws side. In the name of Petitioner No.1 a

             Bank draft amounting to Rs.1,51,000/- which was later converted

             to cash money was given. Initially she allegedly went to Rosera,

             where she spent some happy days in her in-laws house. When she

             returned to her maternal home, her husband allegedly came and

             demanded a motorcycle and one lac rupees. However the said

             demand was not fulfilled. Around October, 2003 she was taken to

             her marital home by the Petitioner No.1 and her brother but they

             started insulting and taunting her for not having brought

             motorcycle and said that they would sell her jewellary and

             purchase the motorcycle. She was fisted and slapped and not given

             food. Petitioner No.1 used to allegedly say that she was not as

             beautiful as they had expected. It was further alleged that the

             accused persons thereafter took all her jewellary and sent her to

             her maternal home. She was then taken by her husband to Delhi

             but after 15 days she was sent back to her maternal home. After a

             while she filed the present complaint on 3.6.2006.

</p><p id="p_4">                         It has been submitted on behalf of the Petitioners that

             right after the death of their father a memorandum of partition was

             entered into between the brothers on 5.1.2005 and they were all

             separate in mess ever since then. Fact of the matter was also that
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2"> Patna High Court Cr.Misc. No.5829 of 2009 (13) dt.24-06-2013                       3</span>




             when the Complainant started to live with her husband in Delhi

             they learnt she was not mentally sound, hence she was treated in

             various hospitals but finding no hope of any cure the husband filed

             HMA petition No.85 of 2005 on 27.1.2005 for divorce on the said

             grounds in which notices and also advertisement were issued.

             Despite the same she did not appear. Finally the Court passed an

             ex-parte decree on 3.2.2006.
</p>
<p id="p_5">                          The submission of the Petitioners is that on 25.5.2005 the

             Petitioner No.1 complained to the authorities with regard to

             Divorce case and the matrimonial dispute to the Dy.S.P., Rosera,

             who enquired the matter and concluded that all the brothers lived

             separately and that they were being maliciously prosecuted.

</p><p id="p_6">                          The further submission is that initially a complaint was

             filed in Samastipur, which was dismissed on jurisdictional error.

             Thereafter a complaint was filed in Dalsingsarai which was sent

             under <a href="/doc/99487/" id="a_4">Section 156(3)</a> Cr.P.C. for investigation but the same ended

             in Final Report and thereafter the protest petition was filed.

             Submission is that evidently the Petitioners had no role to play in

             the matrimonial dispute between the husband and wife nor is there

             any specific allegation with regard to them. It is just because the

             Petitioners were elder brother-in-law and sister-in-law of the

             husband of the Complainant they have been roped in.

</p><p id="p_7">                                 On the other hand, the Counsel for the Complainant

                      submits that since the Petitioners are family members, they should

                      be prosecuted even if there is no specific overt-act alleged against

                      them.
</p>
<p id="p_8">                                 Having considered the entire conspectus of the case, I am

                      inclined to allow the application so far as it relates to the

                      Petitioners.
</p>
<p id="p_9">                                  In view of such, the application is allowed and the order

                      dated 5.1.2009 passed by the Judicial Magistrate, 1 st class,

                      Dalsinghsarai in C.R.No.288 of 2008 corresponding to Trial

                      No.1424 of 2009 is hereby quashed, so far as it relates to the

                      Petitioners.
