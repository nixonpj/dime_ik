      This Writ Petition Coming on for preliminary hearing - B group

                         ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">     The grievances of the petitioner is against the action of

respondent No.3 is not releasing the compensation amount in

respect of land acquired, which the petitioner has bought by a

</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">     2.    After service of notice the learned panel counsel for the

respondent Nos.3 and 4 submits that the entries in all the records

relating to property in question at the time of initiation of

acquisition were standing in the name of vendor of the petitioner

herein; the petitioner has bought the land vide registered sale

dated 04.09.2017, which specifically mentioned that the petition
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                     3</span>

property was not the subject matter of any acquisition, although

a clause therein mentions about the right of the buyer to receiver

the compensation on acquisition thereof; in these circumstances

the compensation payable in respect of the petition land has been

already   deposited    with   the       I   Additional   District   Court,

Ramanagara on 29.10.2018 in terms of provisions of <a href="/doc/2070234/" id="a_1">Section 3D</a>

of the National Highways Act, 1956. He also submits that if the

petitioner makes an application supported by evidentiary material

before the said Court seeking release of the amount, the

respondent Nos.3 and 4 would not oppose the said claim.


</p><p id="p_4">     3.    The learned counsel for the petitioner banking upon

the Division Bench decision of this Court in the case of

Poornaprajna House Bldg. <a href="/doc/765851/" id="a_2">Co-op. Society vs Bailamma @

Dodda Bailamma &amp; others</a> reported in ILR 1998 KAR 1441

submits that the buyer of the property pendente acquisition is

entitled to compensation although he is not entitled to lay a

challenge thereto.    The relevant portion of para 28 of the said

judgment reads as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">           "Writ appeals 2090-94/93 arising out of writ
           petition No.s480 to 384/93 have been filed by the
           purchasers of the lands after the issuance of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                        4</span>

              notification under Section 4(1) of the Act. Now it is a
              well settled proposition of law that a person who
              purchases the land subsequent to the issuance of
              the notification under Section 4(1) of the Act, cannot
              be said to be the owner. Such a purchaser has no
              right to challenge the acquisition itself, although he
              is entitled to claim compensation by virtue of sale
              made in his favour i.e., of right, title and interest of
              his predecessor."</blockquote><p id="p_5">



</p><p id="p_6">      4.      There is force in the contention of the petitioner that

the buyer of the land pendente acquisition, is entitled to the

compensation in his favour subject to vouching the transaction

wherein he derives the title to the land in question.              Since the

amount is already deposited in the jurisdictional Court, the

petitioner is at liberty to make an appropriate application seeking

the release of the said amount on establishing his title to the

compensation amount. If such an application is made, the said

Court shall consider and dispose of petitioner's claim within an

outer limit of three months after having the say of the

respondents in this writ petition and also the vendors of the

petitioner.

</p><p id="p_8">      5.   The submission of the panel counsel of the respondent

Nos.3 and 4 that it shall not oppose the claim of the petitioner for

release of the compensation amount, on the petitioner proving the

title to the land lost in acquisition is placed on record. The writ

petition stands disposed of.
