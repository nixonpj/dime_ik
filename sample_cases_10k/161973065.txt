OF COMPENSATION.

     THIS M.F.A. COMING ON FOR ADMISSION THIS
DAY, N.K. PATIL J., DELIVERED THE FOLLOWING:

                   :J U D G M E N T:
</pre>
<p id="p_1">     Though this matter is posted for admission, it is

taken up for final disposal with the consent of learned

counsel appearing for both the parties.

</p><p id="p_2">     This appeal by the claimants is directed against

the impugned judgment and award dated 30.08.2010
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                              3</span>




passed in MVC No.157/2009 on the file of the Civil

Judge (Sr.Dn.) &amp; MACT at Virajpet, (hereinafter

referred to as 'Tribunal' for short), for enhancement of

compensation.
</p>
<p id="p_3">     2. The Tribunal by its judgment and award has

awarded a sum of Rs.3,89,200/- under different

heads with interest at 6% per annum from the date of

petition till the date of deposit, as against the claim of

the claimants for a sum of Rs. 20,00,000/-, on

account of the death the deceased-M.P. Bopaiah, in

the road traffic accident.
</p>
<p id="p_4">     3. In brief, the facts of the case are:
</p>
<p id="p_5">     The 1st appellant is the wife and the 2nd

appellant is the minor daughter of the deceased and

they have filed a claim petition before the Tribunal

under <a href="/doc/136948773/" id="a_1">section 166</a> of M.V. Act, claiming compensation

against the respondents, on account of the death of

the deceased in the road traffic accident, that

occurred on 12.04.2009 when the deceased was

riding his motor bike bearing Reg. No.KA-12/E-4879
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                            4</span>




towards his residents at Kolathodu-Bygodu, near

Mukkatira Bopaiah's Coffee Estate, due to rash and

negligent driving by the driver of the offending vehicle

bearing Registration No. KA-19/B-1467 belonging to

the 1st respondent. The appellants contend that, the

deceased was aged about 38 years at the time of

accident,   hale   and   healthy    and     was   earning

Rs.6,000/- per month by working as a Manager to

maintain the coffee estate and looking after the

welfare of the family, as he was the only earning

member in the family.     Due to his untimely death,

they suffered mentally and physically and it has also

affected their moral, social and economic status. The

1st appellant has lost her life partner at an very young

age and the daughter has lost love and affection,

inspiration and guidance in life.         The said claim

petition had come up for consideration before the

Tribunal.   The Tribunal after appreciating the oral

and   documentary     evidence     and    other   material

available on file, has allowed the claim petition in part
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                            5</span>




and awarded the compensation of Rs.3,89,200/-

under different heads with interest at 6% p.a., from

the date of petition till the date of deposit. Not being

satisfied with the compensation awarded by the

Tribunal the appellants have presented this appeal,

for enhancement of compensation.
</p>
<p id="p_6">     4.     The submission of Sri L. Harish Kumar,

learned counsel appearing for the appellants at the

outset is that, the Tribunal has erred in taking monthly

income    of the deceased at Rs.3,000/- since         the

deceased was working as a Manager to maintain a coffee

estate and the accident is of the year 2009. Therefore,

he submits the same be re-assessed and award

reasonable compensation towards loss of dependency

and conventional heads by modifying the impugned

judgment and award passed by the Tribunal.

</p><p id="p_7">     5.     Per contra, Sri C. Shankar Reddy, learned

counsel appearing for 3rd respondent-Insurer inter alia

contended    and   substantiated   that,   the   impugned

judgment and award passed by the Tribunal is just and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                               6</span>




proper. It is passed after considering the age, avocation

and year of the accident and other relevant material

available on file. Therefore, interference by this Court is

not called for.
</p>
<p id="p_8">      6. After considering the submissions made by the

learned counsel appearing for both the parties and on

perusal of the material available on record, including

the impugned judgment and award passed by the

Tribunal, the only point that arises for consideration is:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">      "Whether    the    quantum      of   compensation
      awarded     by    the   Tribunal     is   just   and
      reasonable?"</blockquote><p id="p_9">

</p><p id="p_10">      7. It is not in dispute that the deceased died in the

road traffic accident. Further it is not in dispute that,

the deceased was aged about 38 years at the time of

accident, hale and healthy and by working as a

Manager in a coffee estate he was looking after the

welfare of the appellants.        Claimants are none other

than the wife and minor daughter of the deceased, who

have lost their only bread earner and also lost moral

and social support. Taking into consideration the age,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                 7</span>




avocation, year of accident and other relevant facts as

referred above, we can safely re-assess the income of

the deceased at Rs.5,000/- per month to meet the ends

of justice, as against Rs.3,000/- assessed by the

Tribunal.     However,     the      Tribunal    is   justified   in

deducting 1/3rd towards personal expenses of the

deceased and applying the multiplier of 15. The same is

accepted.   Accordingly, out of Rs.5,000/-, if 1/3rd is

deducted, it comes Rs.3,334/-.                 Accordingly, the

appellants are entitled towards loss of dependency at

Rs.6,00,120/- (Rs.3,334/- x 12 x 15).

</p><p id="p_11">     8.     Considering the facts and circumstances of

the case, we deem it fit to award Rs.50,000/- towards

loss of consortium, Rs.20,000/- towards loss of love and

affection, Rs.10,000/- towards loss of estate and

Rs.10,000/-    towards      funeral      and     transportation

expenses.     In all, the appellants are entitled to

Rs.6,90,120/- as against Rs.3,89,200/- awarded by the

Tribunal.      There     will    be    an      enhancement       of

Rs.3,00,920/- with interest at 6% per annum from the

date of deposit till payment.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                              8</span><p id="p_12">




</p><p id="p_13">      9. Having regard to the facts and circumstances

of the case as stated above, appeal is allowed in part.

The impugned judgment and award passed by the

Tribunal dated 30.08.2010 in MVC No. 157/2009 is

hereby modified awarding a sum of Rs.3,00,920/- with

interest at 6% per annum from the date of petition till

payment in addition to the compensation awarded by

the Tribunal.
</p>
<p id="p_14">      The 3rd respondent-Insurer is directed to deposit

the enhanced compensation of Rs.3,00,920/- with

interest at 6% p.a., from the date of petition till the date

of realisation, within three weeks from the date of

receipt of a copy of this judgment.
</p>
<p id="p_15">      Out of the enhanced compensation, Rs.1,00,000/-

with proportionate interest shall be invested in the

Fixed Deposit in any Nationalized or Scheduled Bank, in

the name of the 1st appellant for a period of ten years

and renewable for another five years, with liberty to her

to withdraw the periodical interest accrued on it.

</p><p id="p_16">      Out   of   the    remaining     enhanced     amount,

Rs.1,50,000/- with proportionate interest shall be
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                             9</span>




invested in the name of 2nd appellant till she attains the

age of 30 years with liberty to the 1st appellant to

withdraw the periodical interest accrued on it to the

welfare of 2nd appellant till she attains the age of 21

years and thereafter the 2nd appellant is at liberty to

withdraw the interest accrued on it periodically till she

attains 30 years.
</p>
<p id="p_17">       The remaining Rs.50,920/- with proportionate

interest shall be released in favour of the 1st appellant,

immediately, on deposit by the Insurer.

</p><p id="p_18">       Draw the award, accordingly.
