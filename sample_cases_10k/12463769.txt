Heard On: 12.09.2013.

Judgement On: September 19, 2013.


Prasenjit Mandal, J.: This application is at the instance

of the plaintiffs/appellants and is directed against the

judgment and order dated July 26, 2013 passed by the

learned Additional District Judge, 13th Court, Alipore in

Misc. Appeal No.374 of 2012 thereby setting aside the

Order No.2 dated August 7, 2012 passed by the learned

Civil      Judge-in-Charge      (Junior      Division),   5th   Court,

Alipore in Title Suit Ni.215 of 2012.
        The            plaintiffs/appellants/petitioners                              herein

instituted            the         aforesaid               suit         against          the

defendant/respondent/opposite                       party    herein          before     the</pre>

<p id="p_1">learned Trial Judge praying for a decree of declaration

that the plaintiffs are the sole and absolute owners in

possession which means and include unfettered leasehold

rights      as   the    case       is,       in    respect       of    the     properties

described in the schedules 'A' to 'C' to the plaint and

that the defendant herein and none of his family members

have     got     any     iota       of       right,        title,       interest        and

possession in respect of any part thereof and the decree

for permanent injunction restraining the defendant or any

of his men and agents from exerting and/or attempting to

exert    any     kind       of    and/or          right,    title,          interest    and

possession       in     respect         of    the    said    premises          and    other

reliefs.
</p>
<p id="p_2">       At    the      time   of     filing          the    suit,       the     plaintiffs

prayed for temporary injunction along with a prayer for

ad interim injunction. The learned Trial Judge refused to

grant an ad interim order of injunction and directed the

defendant/respondent/opposite party herein to file a show

cause.       Being     aggrieved,            the     plaintiffs             preferred    an

appeal      being      Misc.       Appeal         No.374     of       2012     and    while

disposing        of    the       said    misc.       appeal,          the    learned    1st
 Appellate    Court      directed          both     the    parties to maintain

status quo in respect of the suit properties till the

disposal    of    the       application          for     temporary        injunction.

Being aggrieved by such order, this application has been

preferred.
</p>
<p id="p_3">     Now,    the       question       is    whether          the    impugned        order

should be sustained.
</p>
<p id="p_4">     Upon hearing the learned Counsel for the parties and

on going through the materials on record, I find that the

plaintiffs/appellants/petitioners herein are the private

limited    companies         and     they    have        filed      this     suit    for

reliefs, already stated in respect of the suit properties

as described in the schedule to the plaint.

</p><pre id="pre_2">     It          is          pertinent              to             mention           that

defendant/respondent/opposite                    party    herein      instituted       a

</pre><p id="p_5">suit being Title Suit No.13482 of 2011 for partition and

accounts    against         his     mother,       brother      and       two   sisters

incorporating         the    suit    properties          of the instant suit

mentioning       his    brother,           i.e.,       the     director        of    the

plaintiffs       of     this       suit     as     co-owner          of    the      suit

properties and that suit is still pending.

</p><p id="p_6">     In the instant suit as per materials on record, the

director    of    the       plaintiffs       is    running         the    development

business    in    the       name    of     the    plaintiff         companies.       The
 plaintiffs       of    the    instant           suit       prayed    for        temporary

injunction restraining the defendant or any of his men

and agents from exerting and/or attempting to exert any

kind of and/or right, title, interest and possession of

any part of the properties of the plaintiffs as stated in

schedules       'A'     to   'C'      of        the       plaint    in     any     manner

whatsoever        either        by        way        of      transfer,          alienate,

encumbrances,          creation       of    a        third      party     interest       in

respect     of        any    property.           As        stated       earlier,        the

plaintiffs are running the development business, but, by

the   impugned         order,        the    First          Appellate           Court    has

directed    both       the   parties            to    maintain       status       quo    in

respect of the suit properties till the disposal of the

injunction petition. This was not at all a prayer of the

plaintiffs,       in    fact,     since         the       subject    matter       of    the

appeal    has    originated          from       the       refusal    of     ad    interim

order of injunction, there was no occasion to consider

the   defence          stand         if     any,           on      behalf        of     the

defendant/respondent and as such, there is no scope to

hold that the defendant has raised any stand that the

plaintiffs       are    about     the      alienate/dispose               of     the   suit

property. So, in my view, the impugned order directing

both the parties to maintain status quo in respect of the
 suit    properties      till    the   disposal      of    the     injunction

petition cannot be sustained.
</p>
<p id="p_7">       Mr.    Shaktinath     Mukherjee,     learned       Senior    Advocate

appearing       for   the   petitioners     has    contended       that   the

findings of the learned First Appellate Court in respect

of the suit properties cannot be supported and the two

suits referred to above cannot be stated to be identical

and moreover, the plaintiffs of the instant suit are not

the parties of the other suit for partition and accounts

and so, the findings of the learned First Appellate Court

cannot be sustained.
</p>
<p id="p_8">       On the other hand, Mr. S.P. Roychowdhury, learned

Senior       Advocate   appearing     for   the    opposite       party   has

drawn my attention to the findings of the learned First

Appellate Court and thus, he has submitted that since a

suit for partition and accounts has been filed wherein

all types of claim could be entertained, there was no

necessity of filing the instant suit by the defendant of

the suit for partition and accounts.
</p>
<p id="p_9">       He has also drawn my attention to the observations

of     the    learned   First    Appellate        Court    that    all    the

questions raised in the instant suit would be decided in

the suit for partition and that there was no necessity

for the present plaintiffs to institute the present suit
 separately and thus, the instant suit is hit by Section

10 of the C.P.C.
</p>
<p id="p_10">       With due respect to Mr. Roychowdhury, I am of the

view    that    these      grounds         were        the    observations           of    the

learned First Appellate Court in the misc. appeal at the

initial stage to consider whether ad interim injunction

should    be    granted          or    not.       In    the    misc.      appeal,          the

learned    First      Appellate            Court       has    observed         that    prima

facie,    the    plaintiffs            are    in       possession         of    the        suit

property and that there is a dispute between the parties

regarding the same. Anyway, since a suit for partition is

pending over the selfsame property before a higher forum,

the learned Trial Judge did not find it apt to pass any

order     in    the       form        of     ad     interim       injunction.              The

application      for        temporary             injunction         is    yet        to    be

disposed of by the learned Trial Judge and the appeal

arising out of the refusal of the prayer for ad interim

injunction      having          been   disposed          of,    instead         of    making

detailed observations on the basis of the materials on

record,    I    am    of    the       view    that       if    the    impugned         order

sustains, the business of the plaintiffs may be hampered.

Since    there       is    no    contrary         materials          at   the    time       of

consideration of the ad interim order of injunction, the

plaintiffs shall be debarred by the impugned order from
 exercising their rights over the suit properties as they

have     prayed       for      injunction       against    the     defendant.

Therefore, without any observations, save and except what

has been recorded earlier, the impugned order relating to

direction      upon      the   parties     to   maintain    status      quo   in

respect      of    the    suit    properties      should    be    vacated     to

enable       the   learned       Trial    Judge     to    take    the    entire

materials on record into consideration for disposal of

the injunction petition upon giving opportunities to the

parties to place their respective materials in support of

their contentions.
</p>
<p id="p_11">       Accordingly, I am of the view that so far of the

order of status quo as passed by the learned 1st Appellate

Court is concerned, the same should be set aside and the

learned Trial Judge should be directed to dispose of the

application        for      temporary     injunction       by    the    end   of

December 2013 without fail. If no written objection is

filed by the defendant/respondent/opposite party herein,

the learned Trial Judge shall give an opportunity to the

defendant/respondent to file a written objection within

the time fixed by him and a rejoinder if any, by the

plaintiff within the time as fixed by him.

</p><p id="p_12">       The     application        is     disposed    of    in    the     manner

indicated above. The learned Trial Judge shall not be
 swayed away by the findings of the learned 1st Appellate

Court   and   of   this   Court   and   he     shall   dispose       of   the

application for temporary injunction on the basis of the

material placed before him by the parties.

</p><p id="p_13">     Considering     the    circumstances,        there       will   be   no

order as to costs.
</p>
<p id="p_14">     Urgent    xerox      certified     copy    of     this    order,      if

applied for, be supplied to the learned Advocates for the

parties on their usual undertaking.
