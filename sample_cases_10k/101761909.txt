</p>
<p id="p_535">            Mr. Y.S. Jadaun, learned counsel appearing on behalf of

Mr. S. K. Gupta, learned Additional Advocate General who appears

on behalf of the appellants-State submits that this matter is

squarely covered by the order dated 20.09.2018 of a coordinate

<p id="p_537">            It is submitted that the respondents, who were the

writ-petitioners, stated before the Court in the writ petition that

they were para teachers. They claimed parity with Teacher Gr.III

and Prabodhaks. The learned Single Judge has allowed the writ

petitions on the very first date of listing without notice to the

appellants herein. The principle of law culled out by the learned

Single Judge is 'equal pay for equal work'.
</p>
<p id="p_538">            There are two infirmities in the impugned orders. The

first is violation of principles of natural justice. The respondents

were not issued a notice before the direction was issued.

<p id="p_539">Secondly,     para   teachers    were    claiming      equivalence    with

Prabodhaks' and Teacher Gr.III. Without deciding equivalence

impugned orders have been passed.
</p>
<p id="p_540">            The appeals are disposed of setting aside the impugned

orders. The writ petitions are restored to its original number for

adjudication before the learned Single Judge with a direction that

after granting the appellants, who are the respondents in the writ

petitions, opportunity of filing a reply to the writ petitions be

decided in accordance with the law.
