<p id="p_1">          This criminal miscellaneous case is filed by the

petitioner, who is the complainant in C.C. No.717/2011

pending before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-1,

Thodupuzha, to quash Annexure-VII under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_1">Section 482</a> of

the Code of Criminal Procedure (hereinafter called 'the

Code').
</p>
<p id="p_2">          2.     It is alleged in the petition that, petitioner is

the complainant in C.C.717/2011 on the file of the Judicial

First Class Magistrate Court-1, Thodupuzha, which was

filed by him under <a href="/doc/686759/" id="a_2">Section 190</a> read with <a href="/doc/444619/" id="a_3">Section 200</a> of the

Code of Criminal Procedure, alleging that accused Nos. 1

and 2 have impersonated him and created sale deed using

general power of attorney executed by the petitioner in

favour of the first accused, showing somebody as the

executant of power of attorney and he had executed two

Crl. M.C.2353 of 2014
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                              2</span>

sale deeds impersonating the original owner of the

property, namely the complainant and put the thumb

impression of somebody else as the thumb impression of the

petitioner before the registering authority and got the

documents executed. According to the petitioner, the

accused persons have committed the offences punishable

under <a href="/doc/123141/" id="a_4">Section 120(B)</a>, <a href="/doc/803870/" id="a_5">403</a>, <a href="/doc/1498132/" id="a_6">409</a>, <a href="/doc/1099980/" id="a_7">420</a>, <a href="/doc/1599077/" id="a_8">468</a> read with <a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_9">Section

34</a> of the Indian Penal Code.         When it came to the

knowledge of the petitioner, he filed a private complaint

before the Judicial First Class Magistrate         Court-1,

Thodupuzha, and after conducting enquiry under <a href="/doc/1149595/" id="a_10">Section

202</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the learned

magistrate       had  taken cognizance   of  the  case   as

C.C.717/2011 and that is pending before that court. He had

filed an application for search of the house of the accused

persons, but the police officials have not conducted proper

search. So he filed Crl.M.C.5259/2013 before this court for

directing the magistrate to issue order to conduct general

search and that was disposed of with a direction directing

Crl. M.C.2353 of 2014
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                   3</span>

the petitioner to file a petition for that purpose and

directing the magistrate to pass orders on the same.

Accordingly, the petitioner filed C.M.P.10421/2013 and the

learned magistrate had issued search warrant to conduct

search to the first respondent and first respondent

conducted search and submitted Annexure-IV search list,

stating that no documents were available there. Aggrieved

by the same, the petitioner had filed this petition, seeking

the following reliefs:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">            i.     Quash   Annexure-VII    search   report   and
      entrust the 2nd respondent or any other official with
      higher rank in the police department to conduct a
      general search to find out the documents as requested by
      the petitioner in Annexure-III and VI petitions.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">            ii.    to grant such other reliefs this Hon'ble court
      deems fit.</blockquote><p id="p_3">

</p><p id="p_4">            3.     Considering the nature of relief claimed in

the petition, this court felt that the petition can be disposed

of hearing the learned counsel for the petitioner and the

learned Government Pleader appearing for respondents 1

and 2.        The prayer in the petition was to entrust

investigation to some other officer of higher rank than the

Crl. M.C.2353 of 2014
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                 4</span>

first respondent.
</p>
<p id="p_5">            4.     It is an admitted fact that, the grievance of

the petitioner is that he is not able to get the original sale

deeds executed by him so as to compare the thumb

impression in the power of attorney with the thumb

impression put before the registrar, to prove that, it was not

executed by the petitioner. In order to get the original of

the sale deeds, he wanted to conduct general search of the

possible places where the original sale deed, which the

accused could have kept to seize the same. It may be

mentioned here that there is no provision in<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_11"> the Criminal

Procedure Code</a> to grant such a relief. If the petitioner can

point out a place or specify a probable place where the

alleged article is kept, then court can issue a search

warrant to a particular officer of the police station within

whose jurisdiction, the search would have been conducted,

authorizing him to conduct the search in that particular

place in accordance with law. If a blank search warrant as

sought for by the petitioner is given, there is a possibility of

Crl. M.C.2353 of 2014
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                 5</span>

misuse of the same by the police. So such a procedure

cannot be adopted as such, which is not provided or

contemplated under<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_12"> the Criminal Procedure Code</a>.

</p><p id="p_6">            5.     The prayer in the petition cannot be granted,

because there is no question of investigation arises, when a

case was taken on the basis of a private complaint. During

the post cognizance stage, while conducting enquiry under

<a href="/doc/1149595/" id="a_13">Section 202</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the

magistrate can conduct an enquiry by examining witnesses

by himself or direct the enquiry to be conducted by some

other agency to get materials for form an opinion as to

whether there is a prima-facie case made out for

proceeding with the case or not. But, once the court has

taken cognizance of the case and decided to issue process

to   the    accused,    then   the   question    of  conducting

investigation by any other agency is not available and it is

for the complainant to adduce evidence under <a href="/doc/1830754/" id="a_14">Section 244</a>

of the Code of Criminal Procedure, to satisfy the court that,

there is prima-facie case to frame charge against the

Crl. M.C.2353 of 2014
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                  6</span>

accused persons for the offence alleged. For that purpose,

the petitioner can adduce evidence before that court. Even

for that purpose, the petitioner can file documents and ask

the document to be sent for expert opinion etc., and the

court can consider and pass appropriate orders in the

applications, if the court feels that, those evidence is

required for the purpose of proper adjudication of the case.

</p><p id="p_7">            So under the circumstances, the petitioner is not

entitled to get the relief claimed in the petition, but that will

not prevent him to move the magistrate court by filing

petitions to receive documents and also send the document

for expert opinion to prove his case and the magistrate

considering those applications and pass appropriate orders

in those application.
</p>
<p id="p_8">            With the above direction and observation, this

criminal miscellaneous case is disposed of.
