Vs 

1.The Tahsildar,
   Taluk Office,
   Thiruvadanai,
   Ramanathapuram District.

2.The Taluk Head Surveyor, 
   Taluk Office,
   Thiruvadanai,
   Ramanathapuram District.

3.The Taluk Assistant Surveyor,
   Taluk Office,
   Thiruvadanai,
   Ramanathapuram District.                                               ..Respondents.
        

Prayer: Writ Petition filed under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India,
praying this Court to issue a Writ of Mandamus directing the  respondents
No.1 to 3 to survey and fix the boundary of the Petitioner's land in
S.No.72/465 B having an extent of 0.01000 sq.meter situated at Thondi Perumal
Kovil Sannathi Street, Thiruvadanai Taluk, Ramanathapuram District based on
the Petitioner's representation dated 29.6.2016 within the time stipulated by
this Court.

!For Petitioner       : M/s.S.Muthukumar
For Respondents  :Mr.S.Kumar  
                   Addl.Govt.Pleader
:ORDER  
</pre>
<p id="p_1">        Heard both sides.
</p>
<p id="p_2">        2.By consent of both sides, the main Writ Petition itself is taken up
for final disposal.
</p>
<p id="p_3">        3.No counter is filed on behalf of the Respondents.
</p>
<p id="p_4">        4.According to the Petitioner, he owns a land in S.No.72/465B,
measuring an extent of 0.0100 sq.meter situated at  Thondi Perumal Kovil
Sannathi Street, Thiruvadanai Taluk, Ramanathapuram District and  is in
possession and enjoyment of the same. In the above said land,  a house as
well as a well  is situated.  In fact, he is paying the house-tax and the
patta also stands in his name. He desires to fence  his property by way of
constructing a compound wall, for which,  he has decided to survey his
property to  fix the proper boundary and to protect his house.
</p>
<p id="p_5">        5.The stand of the Petitioner is that for putting fence in his
property, it is just and necessary to fix  and survey the boundary. Therefore
he has applied for the same before the Taluk Assistant Surveyor,
Thiruvadanai, Ramanathapuram District on 31.5.2016 and also paid the
necessary fees  on the same date. Thereafter, the Respondents  and their
survey officials have not  come to survey and fix the boundary of his
property. Therefore, the Petitioner has once again approached the Respondents
No.1 to 3 Office, but  it proved futile. Also, he made  a representation  to
the Respondents and other higher officials on 29.6.2016.  Even then, no
action was taken by them. Hence the Petitioner has filed the present Writ
Petition before this Court.
</p>
<p id="p_6">        6.In view of the fact that the Petitioner's representation, dated
29.6.2016 is pending before the Respondents, at this stage, this Court, in
the interest of justice and  fair play, simpliciter, directs the First
Respondent/The Tahsildar, Taluk Office, Thiruvadanai, Ramanathapuram District
to look into the representation of the Petitioner, dated 29.6.2016 within a
period of one week from the date of receipt of a copy of this order.
Thereafter, the First Respondent is directed to pass a reasoned speaking
order  on merits, in a free, fair and dispassionate manner(of course after
providing necessary opportunity to the Petitioner and others concerned, if
any, by adhering to the principles of natural justice in  true letter and
spirit) within a period of  three  weeks thereafter.  It is open to the
Petitioner to produce copies of all necessary/relevant documents before the
First Respondent and who in turn  shall take into consideration of the same
at the time of disposal of the representation of the Petitioner, dated
29.6.2016. The Petitioner is directed to lend his assistance and co-operation
to the First Respondent in disposing of his representation, dated 29.6.2016.
</p>
<p id="p_7">        7.With the aforesaid observations and directions, the Writ Petition
stands disposed of.  No costs.
