                 560 of 2014 and, as such, they have been heard together and with

                 the consent of the parties are being disposed of by the present

                 order.

<p id="p_2">                                  Heard the Counsels for the petitioners in both the

                 cases and the APP for the State.

             another accused are named in the First Information Report lodged

             by the father of the victim raising suspicion against the petitioners

             of having committed murder of his son who was having illicit

             relationship with the petitioner of Cr. Misc. No. 8001 of 2015.

</p><p id="p_4">                              Contention of the petitioners is that except suspicion

             raised in the F.I.R., there is nothing tangible to implicate the

             petitioners in the crime. A motive has been assigned that the

             petitioner of Cr. Misc. No. 8001 of 2015 was having physical

             relationship with the deceased and had received certain payments

             from him which she had not repaid.

             custody for more than six months having no criminal antecedent.

             Another co-accused of this case, being son of petitioner of Cr.

             Misc. No. 8001 of 2015, who is similarly named in the F.I.R., has

             since been granted privilege of anticipatory bail vide order dated

             20.05.2015 passed in Cr. Misc. No. 7727 of 2015.

             diary, only points out that one witness has stated about seeing the

             petitioner moving along with the deceased on the relevant night.

<p id="p_9">                                 (ii) In case of framing of charge, the petitioners shall appear

                        cogent/satisfactory reason, the Trial Court shall have liberty to

                        cancel the bail bond of the petitioners and secure their arrest in
