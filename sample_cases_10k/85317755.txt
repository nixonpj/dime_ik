ORDER
</pre>

<p id="p_1">1.   By the present order, I shall dispose of the revision filed by the
revisionist U/s. 399 read with Section 397 Cr. PC. against the order
passed by Ld. MM on 06.02.2008 by which Ld. MM dismissed the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                   2</span>

complaint of revisionist.
</p><p id="p_2">2.      The brief facts giving rise to the filing of revision are that
Respondent No. 2 Sh. Sanjay Jain took a loan of Rs. 37,600/- from
the revisionist for the purchase of Laptop and promised to repay the
amount in 11 equal monthly installments of Rs. 4,236/- alongwith
interest at the rate of 24% per annum. Accused No. 2 issued 11 post
dated cheques in favour of revisionist towards the repayment of the
loan amount alongwith interest.       The revisionist presented three
cheques bearing      No. 791632 dated 16.05.2006 drawn on "THE
NANITAL BANK LTD." 4, Jagriti Enclave, Vikas Marg, Delhi for Rs.
4236/-, Cheque No. 791633 dated 16.06.2006 drawn on "THE
NANITAL BANK LTD." 4, Jagriti Enclave, Vikas Marg, Delhi for Rs.
4236/- and Cheque No. 791634 dated 16.07.2006 drawn on "THE
NANITAL BANK LTD." 4, Jagriti Enclave, Vikas Marg, Delhi for Rs.
4236/- with his Bank "IDBI Bank" branch at Pitampura, Delhi         on
13.10.2006 for encashment. However, cheques were returned by the
Banker of accused No. 2 unpaid, for the reason 'Account closed.' The
intimation to this effect was received by the revisionist on 17.10.2006
from his banker and he issued a legal notice dated 02.11.2006 to
respondent but despite the receipt of the legal notice respondent did
not make the payment to the revisionist.           Consequently, the
revisionist filed a complaint on 10.12.2006.          On 03.09.2007
Complainant led his evidence. On 06.02.2008 Complainant failed to
appear before Ld. MM who dismissed the complaint in default Under
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                     3</span>

<a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_2">Section 204(4)</a> and <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_3">Section 256</a> (1) <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_4">Cr.PC</a>.
</p><p id="p_3">3.     The grievance of the revisionist is that Ld. Trial Court failed to
appreciate that the petitioner had already led his pre-summoning
evidence on 03.09.2007 Ld. Trial Court ought to have issued court
notice to the revisionist before dismissing the complaint.
</p><p id="p_4">4.    I have heard arguments from Ld. Counsel for the revisionist and
Ld. Addl. PP for the State.   I have perused the revision file and also
the Trial Court record.
</p><p id="p_5">5.    The present revision has been filed by the petitioner U/s. 399 and
397 Cr. PC which are re-produced for ready reference.
</p><p id="p_6">      <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_5">Section 399</a> - (1) In the case of any proceeding the record of
which has been called for by himself the Sessions Judge may
exercise all or any of the powers which may be exercised by the
High Court under sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_6">section 401</a>.
</p><p id="p_7">     (2) Where any proceeding by way of revision is commenced
before a Session Judge under sub-section (1), the provisions of
sub-section (2),(3),(4) and (5) of <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_7">section 401</a> shall, so far as may
be, apply to such proceeding and references in the said sub-
sections to the high Court shall be construed as references to
the Sessions Judge.
</p><p id="p_8">     (3) Where any application for revision is made by or on behalf
of any person before the Sessions Judge, the decision of the
Sessions Judge thereon in relation to such person shall be final
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                  4</span>

and no further proceeding by way of revision at the instance of
such person shall be entertained by the High Court or any other
Court.
</p><p id="p_9">    <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_8">Section 397</a> - (1) the High Court or any Sessions Judge may
call for and examine the record of any proceeding before any
inferior Criminal court situate within its or his local jurisdiction
for the purpose of satisfying itself or himself as to the
correctness, legality or propriety of any finding.     sentence or
order, recorded or passed, and as to the regularity of any
proceedings of such inferior Court, and may, when calling for
such record, direct that the execution of any sentence or order
be suspended, and if the accused is in confinement, that he be
released on bail or on his own bond pending the examination of
the record.
</p><p id="p_10">    <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_9">Section 204</a> (4) is also reproduced here:-
</p><p id="p_11">      When by any law for the time being in force any process-
fees or other fees are payable, no process shall be issued until
the fees are paid and, if such fees are not paid within a
reasonable time, the Magistrate may dismiss the complaint.
   <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_10">Section 256</a> (1) provides that if the summons has been issued
on complaint, and on the day appointed for the appearance of
the accused, or any day subsequent thereto to which the hearing
may be adjourned, the complainant does not appear, the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                    5</span>

Magistrate     shall,   notwithstanding      anything     hereinbefore
contained, acquit the accused, unless for some reason he thinks
it proper to adjourn the hearing of the case to some other day.
</p><p id="p_12">6.   A perusal of Trial Court Recod shows that complainant has been
regular in appearance. Only on one day i.e. on 26.04.2007, he was
not present when Court was on leave.           The revisionist led his
evidence on 03.09.2007 on the basis of which Ld. Trial Court held that
a prima-face case was made out against the accused U/s. 138
<a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_11">Negotiable Instrument Act</a> and there was sufficient material on record
to proceed against the accused U/s. 138 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_12">Cr.PC</a>.              Accordingly,
summons were ordered to be issued to the accused on filing of PF
and RC by the revisionist returnable on 06.02.2008.          Trial Court
Record further shows that revisionist did not file the PF and, therefore,
summon could not be issued to the accused. On the next date of
hearing i.e. on 06.02.2008, none appeared on behalf of revisionist
and complaint was dismissed in default.
</p><p id="p_13">7.   In the revision petition no sufficient ground has been mentioned
by the revisionist for his non appearance on 06.02.2008. However,
keeping in the fact that revisionist has been regular in appearance
and led evidence in support        of his complainant,     I am of the
considered that ends of justice would be met if the complaint is
restored to its original number but subject the costs. Accordingly, the
order passed by Ld. MM dated 06.02.208 is set aside. Complainant
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                     6</span>

is restored to its original number subject the costs of Rs. 2,000/- to be
deposited by the revisionist with ld. Trial court within 2 weeks from
the date of this order.   Revisionist will appear before Ld. Trial Court
on 08.09.2008.
</p>

<p id="p_14">8.   The Trial Court record alongwith copy of this order be sent back.
The revision petition file be consigned to Record Room.
