                                   VERSUS


DHARAM SINGH &amp; ANR.                         ......RESPONDENTS



                           J U D G M E N T
</pre>


<p id="p_1">Jagdish Singh Khehar, J.
</p>
<p id="p_2">                    The    appellant    before    this    Court    is    the
management/industry.   It  has  approached  this  Court,   to   assail   the
competence of the respondents  (who  are  the  workmen)  to  be  represented
before the Industrial  Tribunal,  Meerut  (hereafter  referred  to  as  `the
Tribunal'), through five of the respondents/workmen  (Dharam  Singh,  Sanjay
Nagar, Ranveer Nagar, Pratap  Singh  and  Dhanpat  Singh)  out  of  the  113
workmen who were agitating the industrial dispute before the said  Tribunal.
</p>
<p id="p_3">                  Originally,  the  cause  of  the  respondents-workmen  was
espoused by the Noida Engineering Mazdoor Sangh.  However,  consequent  upon
the de-recognition of the aforesaid Union in 2003, the Management  i.e.  the
appellant before us, raised an  objection  that  the  cause  of  respondent-
workmen could no longer be presented through the Noida  Engineering  Mazdoor
Sangh.  The appellant management  accordingly  prayed  that  the  Industrial
Tribunal, should not  proceed  with  the  adjudication  of  the  matter.  On
account of the submission,  that  the  representation  of  the  respondents-
workmen before the Industrial Tribunal, could only  be  in  consonance  with
Section 6-I of the Uttar Pradesh Industrial Disputes Act, 1947  (hereinafter
referred to as the `<a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_1">Industrial Disputes Act</a>')  read  with  Rule  40  of  the
Uttar Pradesh Industrial Disputes Rules, 1957 (hereinafter  referred  to  as
the `Industrial Disputes Rules'), it  was  suggested  that  the  respondent-
workmen should be permitted to make their choice  in  consonance  therewith.
This is the crux of the dispute that has been projected before  us  for  our
consideration.
</p><p id="p_4">                 Despite, the limited scope of the dispute which arises  for
our consideration, it is essential for us, to notice the factual  background
to  the  controversy.  In  the  first  instance,   prolonged    conciliation
proceedings were conducted before the Conciliation Board.   Consequent  upon
the failure  of  the  conciliation  proceedings,  the  State  Government  on
28.05.1998 referred the following disputes for adjudication  to  the  Labour
Court, Ghaziabad:-
</p>
<p id="p_5">            “Whether non-declaration of the 113 workmen,  mentioned  in  the
schedule enclosed, as permanent from the date of their  employment  and  not
paying them equal salary and other benefits by  the  Management  is  illegal
and unjustified?  If yes, to what relief and  other  consequential  benefits
the workmen are entitled to and from which date?”

                 At the instant juncture,  the  respondents-workmen  made  a
representation to the State Government requiring it to transfer  the  matter
for  adjudication  from  the  Labour  Court,  Ghaziabad  to  the  Industrial
Tribunal, Meerut. The request of the  respondents-workmen  was  acceded  to,
whereupon, the State Government  passed  an  order  dated  06.03.1999.   The
Management i.e. the appellant before this Court, assailed  the  above  order
dated 06.03.1999 by filing Civil Miscellaneous  Writ  Petition  No.16666  of
1999.  The aforesaid Writ Petition was allowed by a learned Single Judge  of
the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad (hereinafter referred to  as  `the
High Court') by an order dated 26.09.2002. The  order  dated  06.03.1999  by
which the State Government had transferred the referred  disputes  from  the
Labour Court, Ghaziabad, to the Industrial Tribunal, Meerut, was set  aside,
on the ground  that  the  appellant-management  had  not  been  afforded  an
opportunity of hearing.  The State Government was  accordingly  directed  to
pass an appropriate order, in accordance with law, within a  period  of  six
months.
</p><p id="p_6">                 In compliance of the directions issued by  the  High  Court
(in  Civil  Miscellaneous  Writ  Petition  No.16666  of  1999),  the   State
Government by its order dated 11.02.2003, re-transferred  the  dispute  from
the Industrial Tribunal,  Meerut,  to  the  Labour  Court,  Ghaziabad.   The
instant order was sought to  be  assailed  by  the  Union  representing  the
respondents-workmen, through Civil Miscellaneous Writ Petition  No.13986  of
2003, before the High Court.  The above writ petition came to  be  dismissed
by a learned Single Judge on 02.04.2003. It would  however  be  relevant  to
mention that the following observations were recorded by the High  Court  in
its order dated 02.04.2003 while dismissing the writ petition:
</p><p id="p_7">      “I  am  not  able  to  share  the  apprehension.   The  employers  had
challenged the transfer of reference to Industrial Tribunal, Meerut and  now
after the matter has been  decided  by  State  Government,  maintaining  the
reference to Labour  Court  (II)  at  Ghaziabad,  the  employers  cannot  be
permitted to challenge the same on the ground that the  matter  should  have
been referred to Industrial Tribunal, Meerut.  The reference, does not  fall
in either First or Second Schedules and can be taken to  fall  in  residuary
item No.6 of First Schedule, and thus the  Labour  Court,  is  competent  to
adjudicate the matter.”


      It seems that  the  above  observations  were  not  palatable  to  the
appellant-management.  It  is  therefore   that   the   appellant-management
preferred Special Appeal No.410 of 2003 before a Division Bench of the  High
Court.  Before  the  Division  Bench,  the  submission  of  the   appellant-
management was, that the order dated  02.04.2003  had  been  passed  by  the
learned Single Judge, without giving an  opportunity  to  the  appellant  to
project its case. The High Court did not entertain the above submission  and
disposed of the Special Appeal by an order  dated  13.08.2003.  Liberty  was
however granted to the appellant-management, to  apply  for  recall  of  the
order  passed  by  the  learned  Single  Judge.   It  is  in  the  aforesaid
circumstances, that the appellant-management  filed  a  recall  application,
before  the  learned  Single  Judge.   The  above  application  came  to  be
dismissed on  04.09.2003.  Yet  again,  the  appellant-management  preferred
Special Appeal No.1027 of 2003, to assail order dated  04.09.2003,  whereby,
the recall application preferred by the appellant-management was  dismissed.
 On this occasion with the consent of the rival parties, the Special  Appeal
came to be disposed of, by recording the following observations:
</p><p id="p_8">      “Considering the facts and  circumstances  of  the  present  case  and
considering the case of both the parties to the extent  that  the  reference
case  should  be  decided  by  the  Industrial  Tribunal,  we  transfer  the
reference  case  from  the  Labour  Court-II,  Ghaziabad  to  the  concerned
Industrial Tribunal for its decision  and  direct  the  proceedings  of  the
reference case shall commence from  the  stage  it  was  before  the  Labour
Court, as we find from the records that  the  written  statement  and  other
paraphernalia have already been completed  before  the  Labour  Court.   The
Industrial Tribunal shall, therefore,  dispose  of  the  reference  case  in
accordance with law, within a period  of  three  months  from  the  date  of
production  of  a  certified  copy  of  this  order  without  granting   any
unnecessary adjournment to either of the parties.”


The dispute between the rival  parties  therefore  came  to  be  settled  by
consent inasmuch as, the matter  came  to  be  finally  transferred  to  the
Industrial Tribunal, Meerut i.e. the place suggested by the workmen.
</p><p id="p_9">                  It  is  thereafter  that  the  matter  was  taken  up  for
consideration on merits, by the Industrial  Tribunal,  Meerut.   Before  the
Industrial Tribunal, the appellant-management  filed  an  application  dated
08.02.2006, asserting that the case could not be proceeded further,  because
the Noida Engineering Mazdoor Sangh,  had ceased to be a  recognised  Union.
It was pointed out, that  the  above  Union  came  to  be  de-recognised  on
11.03.2003, and  as  such,  the  officers  of  the  Union  could  no  longer
represent the respondents-workmen.
</p><p id="p_10">                 On 01.05.2006, a meeting of the workmen  (involved  in  the
present controversy) was convened.  71 of the 113  workmen  participated  in
the same. They resolved that, they would henceforth be represented by  5  of
the workmen. It needs to be expressly noticed that these 5 workmen  selected
vide Resolution dated 01.05.2006 were amongst  the  113  respondents-workmen
involved in the controversy.  Representation on behalf of  the  respondents-
workmen in terms of the Resolution dated 01.05.2006 was not accepted by  the
Industrial Tribunal.  Accordingly, vide  its  order  dated  07.08.2006,  the
Industrial Tribunal directed the respondents-workmen to adopt the  procedure
laid down in Rule  40  (1)(i)(c)  of  the  Industrial  Disputes  Rules,  for
finalising their representation before the Industrial Tribunal. The  instant
order passed by the Industrial Tribunal on 07.08.2006 came  to  be  assailed
by one of the respondents-workmen by filing Writ Petition No.58121 of  2006.
 The High Court accepted the claim of the respondent-workmen vide its  order
dated 30.04.2007 by holding as under:-
</p>
<p id="p_11">“9.  The writ petition is allowed. The  order  of  the  Industrial  Tribunal
dated 7.8.2006 in Adjudication Case No.157 of 2003 is quashed.  It  will  be
open to the remaining  workmen,  who  are  interested  in  the  case  to  be
represented by their authorized representatives to pursue the  reference  to
its logical conclusion.  The Industrial Tribunal will do well to decide  the
old matter of the year 1989  on  priority  as  expeditiously  as  possible.”


      The order passed by the  High  Court  on  30.04.2007  is  the  subject
matter of challenge at the hands of  the  appellant-management  through  the
instant civil appeals.
</p><p id="p_12">                 During the  course  of  hearing,  the  solitary  contention
advanced at the hands of the learned counsel for  the  appellant-management,
was premised on Section 6-I of the U.P. Industrial Disputes Act.   The  same
is being extracted hereunder:
</p><p id="p_13">“6-I. Representation of the parties.- (1) Subject to the provisions of  sub-
sections  (2)  and  (3),  the  parties  to  an  industrial  dispute  may  be
represented before  a  Board,  Labour  Court,  or  Tribunal  in  the  manner
prescribed.
</p><p id="p_14">(2)   No party to any proceeding before a Board shall be  represented  by  a
legal practitioner, and no party to any proceeding before a Labour Court  or
Tribunal shall be represented by a legal practitioner,  unless  the  consent
of the other party or parties  to  the  proceeding  and  the  leave  of  the
Presiding Officer of the Labour Court or Tribunal, as the case may  be,  has
been obtained.
</p><p id="p_15">(3)   No officer of a Union shall be entitled to represent any party  unless
a period of two years has elapsed since its registration  under  the  <a href="/doc/1980557/" id="a_2">Indian
Trade Unions Act</a>, 1926, and the Union has been registered for the one  trade
only :
</p><p id="p_16">            Provided that an officer of a federation of unions  may  subject
to such conditions as may be prescribed represent any party.”


      It was the submission of the learned counsel for the  appellant,  that
Sub-sections (2) and (3) of Section 6-I of the U.P.Industrial  Disputes  Act
were inapplicable to  the  present  controversy,  because  the  respondents-
workmen had not sought representation  through  a  legal  practitioner,  and
also because, they had not filed a representation through an officer of  the
Union  in  terms  of  Sub-section  (3)  thereof.   It  was  accordingly  the
submission  of  the  learned   counsel   for   the   appellant,   that   the
representation on behalf of the respondents-workmen  before  the  Industrial
Tribunal, Meerut, could have only been in terms of the mandate contained  in
Sub-section (1) of Section 6-I of the  U.P.Industrial  Disputes  Act,  which
postulates, that representation on behalf of the respondents-workmen  before
the Industrial Tribunal could have only been  “in  the  manner  prescribed”.
Insofar as the instant aspect of the matter is  concerned,  learned  counsel
for the appellant invited our attention to Rule  40  of  the  U.P.Industrial
Disputes Rules, which prescribes the representation of parties.  Rule 40  is
being extracted hereunder:
</p><p id="p_17">“40.  Representation of parties.-(1) The parties may, in  their  discretion,
be represented before a Board, Labour Court or Tribunal,-
in the case of a workman subject to the  provision  of  sub-section  (3)  of
<a href="/doc/1980557/" id="a_3">Section 6-I</a>, by-
</p><p id="p_18">an officer of a Union of which he is member, or
an officer of a Federation of Unions to  which  the  union  referred  to  in
clause (a) above, is affiliated, and
where there is no union of workmen, any representative,  duly  nominated  by
the workman who are entitled to make an application  before  a  Conciliation
Board under  any  orders  issued  by  Government,  or  any  members  of  the
executive, or other officer;
</p><p id="p_19">in the case of an employer, by
an officer of a union or Association of employers of which the  employer  is
a member, or
an officer of a federation of unions or associations of employers  to  which
the union or association  referred to in clause (a)  above,  is  affiliated,
or
by an officer of the concern, if so authorized in writing by the employer :
Provided that no officer of a federation of  unions  shall  be  entitled  to
represent the parties unless the federation has been approved by the  Labour
Commissioner for this purpose.
</p><p id="p_20">(2)   A party appearing through a representative shall be bound by the  acts
of that representative.
</p><p id="p_21">(3)    An  application  for  approval  of  a  federation   of   unions   for
representing the parties before a Board, Labour Court and Tribunal shall  be
made in Form XX to the Labour Commissioner :
</p><p id="p_22">      Provided that no federation of unions shall be entitled to  apply  for

(4)   On receipt of an application under  sub-rule  (3)  above,  the  Labour
Commissioner may, after making such enquiries, as he deems fit, approve  the
federation or reject the application. In case a federation is  approved  its
name shall be notified in  the  Official  Gazette  otherwise  the  applicant
shall be informed of the position in writing by the Labour Commissioner.
(5)   The Labour Commissioner or the Registrar of the  Trade  Unions,  Uttar
Pradesh, may, at any time before or after a federation  has  been  approved,
call for such information from the federation as he considers necessary  and
the federations shall furnish the information so called for.
(6)   Every approved federation shall,-

bearers) within seven days thereof; and

Unions, Uttar Pradesh by December 31 every year a list of unions  affiliated

</p><p id="p_25">(7)   The Labour Commissioner may,  at  any  time  and  for  reasons  to  be
recorded in writing, withdraw the approval granted  to  a  federation  under
sub-rule (4) above.
</p><p id="p_26">(8)   A party aggrieved by the order of the Labour Commissioner  under  sub-
rule (4) or (7) may within one month from the date of the  receipt  of  such

matter shall be final and binding.”


                 It is  the  submission  of  the  learned  counsel  for  the
appellant, that in the absence of  any  Union,  of  which  the  respondents-
workmen were members, Sub-clause  (a)  and  (b)  of  Rule  40(1)(i)  of  the
U.P.Industrial  Disputes  Rules,  would  be  inapplicable.    It   was   his
submission, that the representation on  behalf  of  the  respondents-workmen
could have been only in terms of Rule 40(1)(i)(c).  This, according  to  the
learned counsel for the appellant, was  because  of  the  admitted  position
between the rival parties, that the respondents-workmen were not members  of
any Union of workmen.  In the above view of the matter, placing reliance  on
Rule 40(1)(i)(c), it was the submission  of  the  learned  counsel  for  the
appellant, that the representation  on  behalf  of  the  respondents-workmen
could have been, only out of those workmen who  were  entitled  to  make  an
application before a Conciliation Board, under  the  orders  issued  by  the
Government. In this behalf, reliance  was  placed  on  Notification  No.7248
dated 31.12.1958 (published in U.P.Gazette Extraordinary of 31.12.1958).   A
relevant extract of the aforesaid Notification  dated  31.12.1958  is  being
reproduced hereunder:
</p><p id="p_27">      “Reference of disputes to Conciliation Board – (1) An application  for
the settlement of an industrial dispute may be made before the  Conciliation

</p><p id="p_29">(a) subject to the provisions of sub-section (3) of S.6-1, by an officer  of

number is not more than five;
</p><p id="p_31">      Provided that where no union of workmen exists and the application  is
made by representatives of the workmen duly elected as aforesaid, a copy  of
the resolution adopted at a meeting held for the purpose shall  be  attached
to the application in form I, and
</p><p id="p_32">(ii).......  …...  …...”


      Having placed reliance on the Notification dated  31.12.1958,  learned
counsel for the appellant placed reliance on  a  judgment  rendered  by  the
Allahabad High Court in M/s Mahabir Sizing and  Processing  Co.  and  others
vs. The Industrial Tribunal, Allahabad  (1979 LAB I.C.674).
</p><p id="p_33">                  We  have  given  our  thoughtful  consideration   to   the
submissions advanced at the hands of the learned counsel for the  appellant-
management.  Section 6-I of the  U.P.Industrial  Disputes  Act  has  already
been extracted hereinabove.  Having examined the same minutely,  we  are  of
the considered view  that  <a href="/doc/647144/" id="a_4">Section  6(1)</a>  would  be  applicable  only  in  a
situation where, the workmen seek to be represented by  others,  and  choose
not to represent themselves in the proceedings.  In such an exigency, it  is
imperative to make a choice in terms of the mandate contained in Section  6-
I of the  U.P.Industrial Disputes Act.  It is not open for  the  workmen  to
be represented even through a legal practitioner,  without  the  consent  of
the opposite party.  Representation  through  a  legal  practitioner   other
than by consent of the opposite party, is precluded by <a href="/doc/1980557/" id="a_5">Section  6-I(2)</a>.   In
case the workmen desire to be represented by an officer of  the  Union,  the
choice can only be of such officer who has held the position in  the  Union,
which had subsisted for a period of more than two  years.  We  have  already
extracted hereinabove Rule 40 of the U.P.Industrial  Disputes  Rules.  Under
the above rule also, representation is contemplated through  an  officer  of
the Union, through an officer of the Federation of Unions, and  in  case  of
the absence of any Union, in the manner stipulated under  Rule  40(1)(i)(c).
We find no difficulty whatsoever in concurring with the learned counsel  for
the appellant-management  insofar  as  his  submissions,  on  the  issue  of
representation are concerned.
</p><p id="p_34">                  In  the  adjudication  of  the  present  controversy,  the
primary  issue  to  be  determined  is,   whether   Section   6-I   of   the
U.P.Industrial Disputes Act, and Rule  40  of  the  U.P.Industrial  Disputes
Rules, would be applicable in  a  situation  where  the  workmen  choose  to
present their case before the  Industrial  Tribunal,  by  themselves  or  by
choosing  a  few  amongst  themselves  on  behalf  of  themselves.   In  our
considered view, the choice of an  individual  to  represent  himself  in  a
dispute before a Court or a Tribunal, is a vested  inherent  right.   It  is
only the privilege of being represented through  someone  else,  that  needs
the sanction of law. <a href="/doc/1980557/" id="a_6">Section 6-I</a>, as also, Rule 40  de-alienate  the  extent
to which the above  privilege  can  extend.   In  case,  workmen  before  an
Industrial Tribunal choose to be represented through a concerned  authority,
that choice must be in  conformity  with  <a href="/doc/1980557/" id="a_7">Section  6-I</a>,  as  also,  Rule  40
aforementioned.
</p><p id="p_35">                 During the course  of  hearing,  learned  counsel  for  the
appellant very fairly acceded to the inherent  right  of  an  individual  to
represent himself before a Tribunal or  a  Court.  Insofar  as  the  instant
aspect  of  the  matter  is  concerned,  reference  may  be  made   to   the
observations of this Court in Goa Antibiotics and Pharmaceuticals  Ltd.  vs.
R.K.Chawla and another, (2011) 15 SCC 449, wherein it was held as under:
</p>
<p id="p_36">      “1.   Mr. Vishnu Kerikar, Deputy Manager, Finance &amp; MS  claims  to  be
the  power-of-attorney  holder  of  the  petitioner,   Goa   Antibiotics   &amp;
Pharmaceuticals Ltd. in this case. He wishes to argue  the  case  personally
on behalf of the petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_37">      2.    <a href="/doc/510150/" id="a_8">Section 33</a> of the Advocates Act, 1961 (hereinafter  referred  to
as “the Act”) states as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_38">“33. Advocates alone entitled to practise.—Except as otherwise  provided  in
this Act or in any other law for the time being in force, no  person  shall,
on or after the appointed day, be entitled  to  practise  in  any  court  or
before any authority or person unless he is enrolled as  an  advocate  under
this Act.”

[pic]3.     A perusal of the above provision shows that only  a  person  who
is enrolled as an advocate can practise in a court, except  where  otherwise
provided by law. This is also evident from <a href="/doc/1140599/" id="a_9">Section 29</a> of the Act. A  natural
person can, of course, appear in person and argue his  own  case  personally
but he cannot give a power of attorney to anyone other than a person who  is
enrolled as an advocate to appear on his behalf. To hold otherwise would  be
to defeat the provisions of the <a href="/doc/262262/" id="a_10">Advocates Act</a>.
</p><p id="p_39">4.    <a href="/doc/1577844/" id="a_11">Section 32</a> of  the  Act,  however,  vests  discretion  in  the  court,
authority or person to permit any person who is not enrolled as an  advocate
to appear before the court and argue a particular case. <a href="/doc/1577844/" id="a_12">Section  32</a>  of  the
Act is not the right of a  person  (other  than  an  enrolled  advocate)  to
appear and argue before the court but it is the discretion conferred by  the
Act on the court to permit anyone  to  appear  in  a  particular  case  even
though he is not enrolled as an advocate.”


      It is however the pointed contention of the learned  counsel  for  the
appellant-management, that  in  case  the  respondents-workmen  had  made  a
choice to project their case by themselves, it was  imperative  for  all  of
them, to participate in the proceedings being conducted  by  the  Industrial
Tribunal.  In sum and  substance,  it  is  the  contention  of  the  learned
counsel for the appellant, that in case the  respondents-workmen  choose  to
appear by themselves, all 113 of them had to participate in the  proceedings
before the Industrial Tribunal.  It was therefore his  submission,  that  it
was not open for 5 of them to represent all the 113.
</p><p id="p_40">                 Insofar as  the  above  contention  is  concerned,  learned
counsel for the respondents has invited our attention to <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_13">Section 5-C</a> of  the
Industrial Disputes Act which is reproduced hereunder:
“5-C. Procedure and powers of Boards,  Labour  Courts  and  Tribunals.-  (1)
Subject to any rules that may be made  in  this  behalf,  an  arbitrator,  a
Labour Court or a Tribunal shall follow such procedure  as  the  arbitrator,
the Labour Court or the Tribunal concerned may think fit.
(2)   A Presiding Officer of a Labour  Court  or  a  Tribunal  may  for  the
purpose of enquiry into any existing  or  apprehended  industrial  disputes,
after  giving  reasonable  notice,  enter  the  premises  occupied  by   any
establishment to which the disputes relates.
</p><p id="p_41">(3) Every Board, Labour Court and Tribunal shall have  the  same  powers  as
are vested in a Civil Court under the Code of Civil  Procedure,  1908,  when
trying a suit in respect of the following matters, namely,-
</p><p id="p_42">            (a) enforcing the attendance of any person and examining him  on
oath or affirmation or otherwise;
</p><p id="p_43">            (b) requiring the discovery  and  production  of  documents  and
material objects;
</p><p id="p_44">            (c)  issuing commissions for the examination of witnesses;
</p><p id="p_45">            (d)  inspection of any property  or  thing  including  machinery
concerning any such dispute; and
</p><p id="p_46">            (e)  in respect of such other matters as may be prescribed;
and every enquiry or investigation by a Labour Court or  Tribunal  shall  be
deemed to be a judicial proceeding within the meaning of  <a href="/doc/308396/" id="a_14">Sections  193</a>  and
<a href="/doc/1969991/" id="a_15">228</a> of the Indian Penal Code.”

      A perusal of <a href="/doc/262262/" id="a_16">Section 5-C</a> leaves no room of  any  doubt,  that  in  the
absence of any particular rule, it is open to  an  Industrial  Tribunal,  to
follow such procedure as it may think fit.  We are of the view, that  it  is
well recognised in law, that  in  case  where  more  than  one  persons  are
involved collectively on the same side, it is open to them to choose one  of
more amongst themselves, to represent all of them.  Such provision  is  also
found incorporated under Order 1 Rule VIII of the Code  of  Civil  Procedure
which is being extracted hereunder:
</p><p id="p_47">|“8. One person may sue or defend on behalf of all in same interest.- (1)   |
|Where there are numerous persons having the same interest in one suit,—    |
|(a) one or more of such persons may, with the permission of the court, sue |
|or be sued, or may defend such suit, on behalf of, or for the benefit of,  |
|all persons so interested;                                                 |
|(b) the Court may direct that one or more of such persons may sue or be    |
|sued, or may defend such suit, on behalf of, or for the benefit of, all    |
|persons so interested.                                                     |
|(2) The court shall, in every case where a permission or direction is given|
|under sub-rule (1), at the plaintiff’s expense, give notice of the         |
|institution of the suit to all persons so interested, either by personal   |
|service, or, where, by reason of the number of persons or any other cause, |
|such service is not reasonably practicable, by public advertisement, as the|
|court in each case may direct.                                             |
|(3) Any person on whose behalf, or for whose benefit, a suit is instituted,|
|or defended, under sub-rule (1), may apply to the court to be made a party |
|to such suit.                                                              |
|(4) No part of the claim in any such suit shall be abandoned under sub-rule|
|(1), and no such suit shall be withdrawn under sub-rule (3), of rule 1 of  |
|Order XXIII, and no agreement, compromise or satisfaction shall be recorded|
|in any such suit under rule 3 of that Order, unless the court has given, at|
|the plaintiff’s expense, notice to all persons so interested in the manner |
|specified in sub-rule (2).                                                 |
|(5) Where any person suing or defending in any such suit does not proceed  |
|with due diligence in the suit or defence, the court may substitute in his |
|place any other person having the same interest in the suit.               |
|(6) A decree passed in a suit under this rule shall be binding on all      |
|persons on whose behalf, or for whose benefit, the suit is instituted, or  |
|defended, as the case may be.”                                             |


      In such view of the matter, we are satisfied, that it was open to  the
respondents-workmen to choose one or more amongst themselves,  to  represent
all of them before the  Industrial  Tribunal.   In  view  of  the  aforesaid
finding, we find no infirmity in the  impugned  order  passed  by  the  High
Court.
</p><p id="p_48">                  While  disposing  of  the  present  controversy,   it   is
necessary for us to clarify that the instant conclusion has  been  drawn  by
categorically  arriving  at  the  conclusion  that  Section   6-I   of   the
U.P.Industrial Disputes Act and  Rule  40  of  the  U.P.Industrial  Disputes
Rules, would be applicable, only in a situation where the workmen choose  to
be represented through a third party before the  Industrial  Tribunal.   The
above provisions would be inapplicable, when the workmen choose  to  present
their own case by themselves. In the instant situation, none  of  the  above
provisions would be invoked.  Accordingly, it is also imperative for  us  to
hold, that  the  judgment  relied  upon  by  the  learned  counsel  for  the
appellant, would not be applicable to the facts  and  circumstances  of  the
present case, since the aforesaid judgment was  on  the  interpretation  and
the applicability of Rule 40(1)(i)(c) of the U.P.Industrial Disputes Rules.
</p><p id="p_49">                 The narration of above-mentioned facts  reveals,  that  the
respondents-workmen were inducted into  the  employment  of  the  appellant-
management before 1989.  Conciliation proceedings were  initiated  on  their
behalf  by  the  employees  Union  in  1989.  The   workmen   were   seeking
regularisation from the date of  their  employment,  and  wages  (and  other
allied benefits connected to the wages) being paid to  permanent  employees.
The process of conciliation continued for about  a  decade,  whereupon,  the
State Government made a reference of the industrial dispute  raised  by  the
respondents-workmen  on  28.05.1998.  Eversince  the  above  reference,  the
appellant-management has initiated one or the other proceedings  before  the
High Court, which has stalled the very initiation of consideration,  of  the
claim  of  the  respondents-workmen.  The  appellant-management   was   also
dissatisfied with the determination of the State Government in  transferring
the adjudication of the dispute from the  Labour  Court,  Ghaziabad  to  the
Industrial Tribunal, Meerut vide its order dated  06.03.1999.   A  challenge
to the same was raised before the High Court repeatedly.  Eventually, by  an
order dated 28.10.2003, the appellant-management  by  consent  accepted  the
adjudication of the dispute by the Industrial Tribunal,  Meerut.   This  was
where the matter was ordered to be determined by the State  Government  vide
its order  dated  06.03.1999,  at  the  asking  of  the  workmen.   What  is
important is, that large number of years came  to  be  wasted  in  something
which was eventually acceded to  voluntarily  by  the  appellant-management.
Even in  so  far  as  the  present  controversy  is  concerned,  it  is  not
understandable  why  the  appellant-management  was  dissatisfied  with  the
representation of 5 of the workmen before the Industrial  Tribunal.   It  is
not possible for us to understand what prejudice could have been  caused  to
the appellant-management if  5  workmen  had  represented  the  respondents-
workmen before the Industrial Tribunal, Meerut.  All the  same,  the  matter
was brought to this Court in 2008  and  is  now  being  adjudicated  finally
after a lapse of 6 years.  The sequence of facts noted  hereinabove  reveals
that the claim which commenced in 1989 and was referred for adjudication  by
the  State  Government  in  1998,  has  still  not   been   taken   up   for
consideration.  During the  course  of  hearing,  learned  counsel  for  the
appellant-management invited our attention to the  fact,  that  out  of  113
original workmen, on whose behalf the Union had initiated proceedings  under
the <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_17">Industrial  Disputes  Act</a>,  1947  had  entered  into  an  out  of  Court
settlement  with  the  appellant-management.   24  of  them  have  remained.
Insofar as  the  remaining  24  are  concerned,  their  services  have  been
terminated during the  pendency  of  the  adjudicatory  process.  While  the
services of Hari Niwas, one of the respondents-workmen, were  terminated  in
the year 2000, the services of all the remaining workmen were terminated  in
the year 2005.  We are  of  the  view,  that  the  appellant-management  has
abused the judicial process, and thereby, tired  out  the  workmen,  in  the
legitimate pursuit of their alleged rights. This  is  not  the  purpose  for
which these  adjudicatory  processes  have  been  awarded  for.  It  is  for
expeditious relief to workmen employed in industries, that these  beneficial
legislations have been enacted.  We are of the view that  some  compensation
should be awarded to the respondents-workmen for  having  remained  involved
in  this  assiduously  long  process  of  litigation.   We  therefore  while
dismissing the instant appeals, direct the appellant-management  to  pay  as
cost a sum of Rs.1 lakh to each of the remaining contesting workmen.
</p><p id="p_50">                 In  view  of  the  inordinate  delay  in  the  adjudicatory
process, on account of litigation at the higher levels, we would direct  the
Industrial  Tribunal,  Meerut  to  make  all  efforts  to  dispose  of   the
controversy within nine months from the date the parties appear  before  the
Industrial Tribunal.
