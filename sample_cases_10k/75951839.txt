REKHA MITTAL, J.
</pre>

<p id="p_1">            The present appeal has been directed against the award dated

28.2.2009 passed by the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Kurukshetra (in

short "the Tribunal") whereby compensation has been awarded to the tune

of Rs. 50,000/- in regard to death of Gaffar Naik @ Gaffar in a motor

vehicular accident which took place on 11.1.2007.

</p><p id="p_2">            Abdul Gani Naik @ Gani @ Abdul Gani claiming himself to be

legal representative of the deceased on the basis of Will and Jaiba and

others, daughters of said Gaffar Naik claimed compensation under <a href="/doc/136948773/" id="a_1">Section

166</a> of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 (in short "the Act").

</p><p id="p_3">            The learned Tribunal held that the claimants are not dependents

upon earning of the deceased, therefore, while relying upon judgment of the

Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in <a href="/doc/794650/" id="a_2">Manjuri Bera vs. Oriental Insurance
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1"> F.A.O. No.3245 of 2009                             -2-</span>

Company Limited and another</a> 2007(2)PLR 611 (SC) awarded

compensation to the tune of Rs. 50,000/- by invoking provisions of <a href="/doc/32775809/" id="a_3">Section

140</a> of the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_4">            The present appeal has been preferred by the claimants seeking

enhancement of compensation.
</p>
<p id="p_5">             Counsel for the appellants contends that even if daughters of

the deceased were married and staying in their respective matrimonial

homes at the time of death of Gaffar Naik, they are entitled to claim

compensation in regard to loss of estate which they are entitled to inherit on

death of said Gaffar Naik. It is further argued that in the judgment passed

by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in Majuri Bera's case (supra), it

has no where been held that claim of a married daughter can be restricted

only to an amount of Rs. 50,000/- under <a href="/doc/32775809/" id="a_4">Section 140</a> of the Act. It is further

argued that Abdul Gani Naik is also entitled to benefit of loss of estate as

the deceased executed a Will in his favour which is marked on record.

</p><p id="p_6">                   There is no representation on behalf of respondent No. 3

(insurance company) though earlier Ms. Shamsher Kaur, Advocate had put

in appearance on its behalf.
</p>
<p id="p_7">                   I have heard counsel for the appellants and perused the

records.
</p>
<p id="p_8">                   The learned Tribunal has not awarded any compensation

in favour of Abdul Gani Naik but awarded a sum of Rs. 50,000/- in favour

of daughters of the deceased. Counsel has fairly conceded that the Will

propounded by Gani Naik has not been proved in accordance with law

though two witnesses were examined in regard to the said Will. Be that as it

may, there is no dispute about the fact that Jaiba and others are the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2"> F.A.O. No.3245 of 2009                              -3-</span>

daughters of deceased Gaffar Naik.
</p>
<p id="p_9">                     The question which arises for consideration is whether

the daughters of the deceased are entitled to enhancement of compensation

in regard to loss of estate.
</p>
<p id="p_10">                    This question came up for consideration before this

Court in Miss Nandini Minor and others vs. Amrik Singh and others,

FAO No. 450 of 1994 decided on 27.1.2011. In the said case, it was held

that legal heirs of the deceased are entitled to compensation in regard to loss

of estate and expenses on funeral and they were allowed benefit of 50%of

earning of the deceased by adopting a suitable multiplier keeping in view

the number of years of service of the deceased coupled with there being

adequate avenues for his employment after retirement.

</p><p id="p_11">                    In the case at hand, the deceased was statedly working on

a saw mill (Aara). Though the records of the case have been destroyed in

the fire incident but counsel has placed on record certain documents to

prove that the employer of the deceased namely Amrik Singh                 was

examined and he tendered into evidence his affidavit Ex. PW4/A and

deposed that the deceased was working as a mistri for cutting wood at a

monthly salary of Rs.6500/-. Counsel has fairly conceded that Amrik

Singh did not produce any documentary evidence in regard to extent of

salary being paid to the deceased. The statement of Amrik Singh is silent

as to since when the deceased was employed by him. The appellants have

failed to adduce cogent and convincing evidence on record to prove actual

earning of the deceased. This Court cannot overlook the fact that in claims

for compensation, the claimants generally have tendency to exaggerate the

figures of income of the deceased. However, there is nothing on record to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3"> F.A.O. No.3245 of 2009                               -4-</span>

suggest that the deceased was suffering from any ailment rendering him

unable to work and earn his livelihood. Keeping in view the minimum

wage of a skilled labour, fixed by the State of Haryana in the year 2007, I

assess income of the deceased at Rs. 2800/- per month. As the deceased

was required to meet his expenses and could afford to spend lavishly being

sole dependent on his earning, loss to estate is assessed to the tune of Rs.

1000/- per month. The deceased was 48 years old as reflected in his post

mortem report. In the light of principles laid down in <a href="/doc/837924/" id="a_5">Smt. Sarla Verma

and others vs. Delhi Transport Corporation and another</a> 2009 (3)RCR

(Civil) 77, multiplier of 13 is allowed to compute loss of estate. Under

these circumstance, loss of estate is calculated at Rs. 1000x12x13

=Rs.1,56,000/-.
</p>
<p id="p_12">                    The appellants shall be entitled to an amount of Rs.

4000/- for expenses on funeral of the deceased. The total compensation for

loss of estate and funeral expenses comes to Rs. 1,60,000/- and the

enhanced compensation is Rs. 1,10,000/- payable to Jaiba and others,

daughters of the deceased in equal shares, with interest at the rate of 7.5%

per annum from the date of filing of the petition till realization. In case, the

insurer deposits the amount within 45 days, interest at the rate of 6% per

annum is payable.
</p>
<p id="p_13">                    For the reasons stated above, the appeal is partly allowed

in the aforesaid terms.
