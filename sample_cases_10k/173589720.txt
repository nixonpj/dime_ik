By the Court:-</pre>

<p id="p_1">Petitioners have filed this writ petition praying for a direction to the respondents to make notional fixation and salary fixation as well as seniority of the petitioners be given from the date of appointments as were given to other persons selected through same process.
</p><p id="p_2">Pursuant to advertisement dated 30.10.2006, petitioners were appointed on the post of Teacher Gr.III vide orders dated 12.03.2013 and 07.03.2013. In the meanwhile, Writ Petition No.6707/2007  Ashok Kumar Baser vs. State of Rajasthan and Another came to be decided by a coordinate bench of this court at its Principal Seat, Jodhpur, wherein following observations were made:-
</p><p id="p_3">Having considered all the facts and circumstances of the case, I deem it appropriate to accept the petition for writ with a direction to the respondents to consider the case of the petitioners for the pot for which they applied under the advertisement Annex.1, if they are otherwise eligible and meritorious. The appointment to the petitioners may be given from the date appointments were accorded to other persons as a consequent to the process of selection in question. The seniority and all other benefits including fixation of pay on notional basis in the event of grant of appointment shall be reckoned from the date appointments were given to other persons selected through same process. However, they shall not be entitled for actual payment of wages for the period concerned. Necessary orders for compliance of the directions given are required to be passed by the respondents or order before 31.03.2012.
</p><p id="p_4">It is contended that notional benefits have been granted to other candidates on the basis of the aforesaid judgment in Ashok Kumar Baser, supra.
</p><p id="p_5">Learned counsel for petitioners submits that similar directions may be given in the case of the petitioners as were given in Ashok Kumar Baser, supra.
</p><p id="p_6">In view of the above, writ petition is disposed of requiring petitioners to make a representation to respondent no.2  the Director, Primary Education, Bikaner, along-with a copy of this order, who shall consider the same and pass appropriate order addressing the grievance of the petitioners in the light of aforesaid judgment in Ashok Kumar Baser, supra, within a period of three months, or otherwise pass a speaking order. In case the grievance of the petitioners is not remedied, they may approach the Rajasthan Civil Services Appellate Tribunal.
