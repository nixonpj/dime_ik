SUIT NO.39/04

            MR. RAJINDAR MOHINDRA &amp; ANR.
                                                    ....PLAINTIFFS

                              ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">1.    This order shall dispose of defendant's application dated

24/07/06 seeking to amend the            written statement dated

21/09/02 in order to insert a preliminary objection worded as

follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">              "15. That the suit is liable to be
              dismissed and no order for recovery of
              possession is liable to be passed in
              favour of the plaintiffs and against
              the defendant with respect to the suit
              property. It may be appreciated that
              the plaintiffs are debarred from
              enforcing any right in respect of the
              suit property against the defendant in
              view of <a href="/doc/221518/" id="a_1">section 53A</a> of the Transfer of
              Property Act. It may be appreciated
              that    admittedly     the    plaintiffs
              contracted to transfer the suit
              property in favour of the defendant in
              writing, the defendant in part
              performance of the contract was

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                                                  2</span>

              already in possession and continues
              to be in possession of the suit
              property, the defendant has done
              various acts in furtherance of the
              contract and the defendant has all
              along been willing and is willing to
              perform its part of the contract".
</blockquote>
<p id="p_2">The reason for seeking amendment, as expressed in the

application    under   consideration,   is   that   although   the

pleadings clearly establish that the defendant is entitled to

protection of <a href="/doc/221518/" id="a_2">section 53A</a> Transfer of Property Act, since

plaintiffs have taken a frivolous objection of lack of specific

submission, the amendment of written statement has become

necessary.
</p>
<p id="p_3">2.    Reply to the amendment application was filed on behalf

of plaintiffs strongly opposing the same, mainly on the

grounds that by way of the amendment sought, the defendant

is trying to retract certain vital admissions made by it in the

written statement and if allowed, the same would severely

prejudice case of the plaintiff. The amendment sought is not

just malafide, having been brought after more than five years

and it would frustrate plaintiff's pending application under

Order XII Rule 6 CPC, the same is also not necessary for



CS/39/04                                        Page 2 of 27 pages
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                                                 3</span>

deciding the controversy between the parties.

</p><p id="p_4">3.    I have heard at length ld counsel for both the sides and

perused the entire record.
</p>
<p id="p_5">4.    Briefly stated, facts relevant for present purposes are as

follows. Plaintiffs of this Suit for Recovery of Possession of

tenanted property with mesne profits executed lease deed

dated 8/4/86, which was got registered thereby inducting the

defendant as tenant in the premises bearing no.E44/10,

Okhla Industrial Area, Phase-II, New Delhi (hereinafter

referred to as the suit property) for a period of five years at a

monthly rent of Rs.20,607/-. In terms with Clause 3 of the

lease deed, defendant exercised their option to renew the lease

twice for a period of five years each time with enhanced rent.

The lease was terminated by way of a quit notice dated

7/3/2001 and also expired by efflux of time on 31/3/2001.

</p><p id="p_6">5.    During pendency of the lease, plaintiffs having acquired

citizenship of USA in the year 1987 were advised by the

Reserve Bank of India to transfer the suit property to some

Indian citizen in order to avoid penal action under the then

existing law. As such, plaintiffs entered into an Agreement to



CS/39/04                                        Page 3 of 27 pages
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                                                     4</span>

Sell dated 20/11/1989 with the defendant with regard to the

suit property. However, in view of the liberalizing economy and

softening of the policies that was undergoing at that time, an

exit option clause was inserted in the Agreement to Sell to the

effect that plaintiffs would continue to be owners of the suit

property and in case plaintiffs opted not to complete sale

transaction, money paid by the defendant would be refunded.

By way of a notification dated 26/5/1993 and other policies of

the Govt. of India, foreign citizens of Indian origin were

permitted to acquire and hold immoveable property in India.

Plaintiffs'   position   having   changed,   they     cancelled   the

Agreement to Sell vide their letter dated 28/12/1993 and

returned the amount of Rs.3,00,000/- to the defendant.

Thence, as per plaintiffs the Agreement to Sell stands

cancelled and is non-est.
</p>
<p id="p_7">6.     Defendant, thereafter filed suit No.705/94 in the Hon'ble

High Court of Delhi, seeking specific performance of the

Agreement to Sell. In the said suit, in presence of the present

plaintiffs as caveators, Hon'ble High Court passed an interim

order dated 25/3/94, relevant extract whereof is:



</p><p id="p_8">CS/39/04                                            Page 4 of 27 pages
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                                                 5</span>

      "Meanwhile, the parties are directed to maintain
      status-quo with regard to possession as well as title
      of the property. The plaintiff is further directed to
      continue to pay the admitted amount of rent to the
      defendants till further orders. This is however,
      without prejudice to the contentions of the plaintiff
      that   this     amount   is   not   payable."(emphasis
      supplied)

By way of order dated 27/11/1997, the said interim order was

made absolute, relevant extract whereof is as follows:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">      "The interim order had been made on March 25,
      1994 by which the parties were directed to maintain
      status quo. The learned counsel for the defendants
      does not pray for any modification of the same. The
      order dated March 25, 1994 shall continue during
      the pendency of the present proceedings. I.A. stands
      disposed of."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_9">7.    During pendency of the Suit No. 705/94 plaintiffs

brought the present suit for recovery of possession and mesne

profits. In its Written Statement, the defendant pleaded inter

alia that the notification relied upon by the plaintiffs is

inapplicable since at the time of purchase of the suit property,

plaintiffs were Indian citizens and consequently plaintiffs'

unilateral cancellation of Agreement to Sell was illegal.

</p><p id="p_10">CS/39/04                                        Page 5 of 27 pages
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                                                   6</span>

</p><p id="p_11">8.    In Written Statement, defendant also pleaded that in

view of the above mentioned orders of Hon'ble High Court in

Suit No. 705/94 the        present suit cannot be allowed to

continue till disposal of that suit and even if this suit is

decreed, the same would be in conflict with the orders passed

in Suit No. 705/94. As such a preliminary issue was framed

by my ld predecessor on 12/05/05, which was decided in

favour of plaintiffs vide order dated 04/11/06. The said order

having not been challenged, has attained finality.

</p><p id="p_12">9.    In order to appreciate the      rival contentions qua this

amendment application, it would be appropriate to quote the

relevant portion of the above said order dated 04/11/06 of

this court since one of the opposition to amendment is that if

allowed,   the     amendment     would    be   contrary    to   the

observations which have attained finality. The said portion of

order dated 04/11/06 pertaining to the defence of <a href="/doc/221518/" id="a_3">section 53A</a>

Transfer of Property Act is as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">        "18.     The Division Bench of Hon'ble Patna
        High Court in the case of Dr.N.P.TRIPATHI
        (supra) also held that under such a situation
        the tenant cannot resort to <a href="/doc/221518/" id="a_4">Section 53A</a>,
        <a href="/doc/515323/" id="a_5">Transfer of Property Act</a>, as a weapon of offence

CS/39/04                                         Page 6 of 27 pages
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                                                 7</span>

      by claiming adversary title alleging that by
      virtue of the sale agreement he continued as
      not a tenant but a transferee, since the
      provision can be used only as a shield and not
      as a sword. Even in the present case, pleadings
      amply establish that possession of the suit
      property continues to be held by the present
      defendant as a tenant under the lease deeds
      and not as a transferee under the Agreement to
      Sell. Even after execution of the Agreement to
      Sell the present defendant not just continued
      paying rent but even enhanced the rent rate in
      terms with the lease. Hon'ble High Court also
      directed the present defendant to continue
      paying rent, though without prejudice to the
      contentions of the present defendant. In his
      pleadings also the present defendant banks his
      protection on Clause 3 of the lease deed only.</blockquote><p id="p_13">
</p><p id="p_14">      In paras 21 and 23 of the Written Statement
      the defence against the present suit pleaded is
      that   consent   for   renewal   of   lease,   as
      contemplated by Clause 3 of the lease deed
      could not be withheld unreasonably by the
      present plaintiff. As reflected from para 26 of
      the Written Statement, the present defendant
      continued to request the present plaintiff to
      renew the lease even more than a decade after
      execution of the sale agreement. This shows
      amply that the defendant always claimed itself

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                                                  8</span>

       to be in possession of the suit property as a
       tenant and not as a transferee. As such,
       <a href="/doc/221518/" id="a_6">Section 53A</a>, <a href="/doc/515323/" id="a_7">Transfer of Property Act</a> also does
       not come to the rescue of defendant in this
       case."(The cited judgment in the case of Dr. N.P.
       TRIPATHI is reported as <a href="/doc/1164716/" id="a_8">Dr. N. P. TRIPATHI vs
       DAYAMANTI DEVI</a>, AIR 1988 Patna 123)

</p><p id="p_15">10.   It is argued on behalf of defendant that in view of above

cited observations made in order dated 04/11/06, defendant

needs to formally incorporate plea of <a href="/doc/221518/" id="a_9">section 53A</a>, <a href="/doc/515323/" id="a_10">Transfer of

Property Act</a>.   As per defendant, the plea           sought to be

inserted now is not without basis since facts qua possession of

the defendant as a purchaser have already been pleaded in

the written statement to this suit and also in the suit of

defendant which is pending before the Hon'ble High Court. Ld

counsel for defendant took me through para 2 to 13 of the

written statement and argued that the defendant has already

pleaded at length that an agreement to sell the suit property

had been executed between the parties and possession of the

defendant is in capacity as a purchaser, hence no additional

plea is being brought in by way of amendment. It was also

argued that vide order dated 25/03/94 in the defendant's suit

Hon'ble High Court directed the present defendant to pay

occupation charges without prejudice to its contentions,

which     also reflects that defendant has throughout been

claiming its possession of the suit property as a purchaser in

part performance of agreement to sell and the same entitles

the defendant to protection under <a href="/doc/221518/" id="a_11">section 53A</a> Transfer of

<p id="p_16">11.     Per contra, ld counsel for plaintiffs argued that the

amendment sought is not necessary for decision of this suit

and the same is rather malafide. It was argued that liberal

approach while dealing with amendment application does not

mean that the amendment has to be allowed in every case.

Defendant, by way of the amendment sought, is trying to

withdraw admissions made in the written statement on the

basis whereof the above quoted observations were recorded in

order dated 04/11/06.     Ld counsel for plaintiffs vehemently

denied that the defendant has pleaded its possession as a

purchaser and took me through the           complete written

statement in support of his stand that defendant has

throughout pleaded his possession as a tenant, which

admissions are now being sought to be diluted by inserting for

the first time a plea of <a href="/doc/221518/" id="a_12">section 53A</a> Transfer of Property Act

protection. It was argued that in the name of inconsistent

pleas the defendant cannot be allowed to bring in by way of

amendment a plea which is destructive of its already pleaded

case. Ld counsel for plaintiffs also took me through the

agreement to sell on the basis of which     the defendant had

filed the suit for specific performance before Hon'ble High

Court and demonstrated that even after execution of the

agreement to sell the defendant continued paying rent as well

as enhanced rent as a tenant. It was argued that even before

the Hon'ble High Court     at the stage of interim order dated

25/03/94 the present defendant did not claim his possession

of the suit property as owner. The amendment under

consideration will also frustrate the plaintiffs' application

under Order XII Rule 6 CPC which came on the basis of

admissions, now tried to be diluted. It was also argued that

absence of explicit plea   of <a href="/doc/221518/" id="a_13">section 53A</a> Transfer of Property

Act does not make it difficult for the court to decide this suit

therefore the amendment sought is also not necessary.

reliance on para 19 of the written statement and contended

counsel for plaintiffs contended that no paragraph of written

took me through para 19 of the plaint while reading the

corresponding paragraph of written statement to explain

discussed above as cited by both the sides, what is to be seen

is as to whether the amendment sought in the written

controversy; whether the amendment sought is bonafide;

whether the amendment sought tends to retract admissions of

the defendant in the written statement on the basis of which

application under Order XII Rule 6 CPC was filed by the

plaintiff; and whether by way of amendment sought, the

defendant can be allowed to raise a plea destructive of its plea

in the existing written statement. So far as legal propositions

laid down in the above cited pronouncements is concerned,

there can certainly be no dispute. Case of the defendant has

to be considered within the four corners of the above

discussed law.     At the same time, adoption of "liberal

be allowed irrespective of the parameters discussed above.

</p><p id="p_33">26.     In order to appreciate the necessity of the amendment

sought for effective decision of the controversy in suit, the

pleadings have to be read in entirety and not piecemeal.

Similarly, no paragraph of pleading of one party can be read

dehors the corresponding para of the pleading of the other

side.
</p>
<p id="p_34">27.     The core question is as to whether the defendant in its

pleadings and documents has claimed its possession of the

suit property in the capacity of a tenant under the lease deed

or in the capacity of a purchaser in part performance of the

agreement to sell. If it is the latter, defendant might succeed

in claiming protection under <a href="/doc/221518/" id="a_24">section 53A</a> Transfer of Property

Act but if it is latter, defendant would fail. I am fully conscious

that truth or merits of the amendment sought fall beyond the

scope of present consideration. But at the same time, the

issue is necessary in order to decipher the fides of the

defendant in the circumstances of this case to which I shall

revert. Besides, if pleadings and documents of the defendant

show that his possession is that of a tenant, allowing the

amendment sought would displace the plaintiff completely

from the admissions and cause irretrievable prejudice to the

plaintiff's case in addition to permitting a plea destructive of

the defence plea on record.
</p>
<p id="p_35">28.   Read in its entirety and in consonance with the

corresponding paragraphs of plaint, the written statement is

categorical that possession of the defendant in the suit

property is as a tenant under the lease deed and not as a

purchaser under the agreement to sell. Some of the instances

of pleadings are recorded as follows.
</p>
<p id="p_36">29.   In para 10 of the plaint, it is pleaded that the defendant

assumed possession of the suit property under lease with

effect from 01/04/1986 and in the corresponding para of

written statement, the defendant pleaded that the same is

matter of record.   In para 11 of the plaint, plaintiff pleaded

about expiry of the initial lease on 31/03/91 and first option

of renewal of lease by increasing rent exercised by the

defendant, which is stated to be matter of record in the

corresponding para of written statement. In para 12 of the

plaint it is pleaded that after expiry of second period of lease

on 31/03/96 the defendant exercised second renewal option

by increasing the rent and the corresponding para of written

statement pleads it to be a matter of record. Paras 13-17 of

the plaint plead about the agreement to sell dated 20/11/89

pertaining   to the suit property between the parties and

exercise of exit option by the plaintiffs vide their letter dated

28/12/93 thereby cancelling the agreement to sell.            In the

corresponding    paragraphs,    it   is   mainly    pleaded     that

cancellation of agreement to sell by the plaintiffs is not

sustainable in law. In paras 20-22 of the plaint, it is pleaded

that the second lease renewal option availed of by the

defendant expired on 31/03/01 and further extension could

not be done without plaintiffs' consent            which was not

accorded and the lease also expired by a efflux of time on

31/03/01 besides a quit notice which was also served

terminating the tenancy with effect from 07/04/01.                In

corresponding paragraphs of written statement, the defendant

pleaded that it had called upon the plaintiffs to renew the

lease but the latter refused to do so without giving any

reasons in violation of clause 3 of the lease deed and in view of

order dated 25/03/94 of Hon'ble High Court, defendants

cannot be deprived of possession of the suit property. In para

23 of the plaint it is pleaded that the defendant was called

upon to give inspection of the suit property and settle

accounts for refund of security deposit. In corresponding para

of written statement the defendant specifically pleads that "as

the defendants have exercised    their right for extension of the

lease the question of plaintiffs' refunding the security deposit

to the defendants does not arise".
</p>
<p id="p_37">30.   In paras 24&amp;25 of the written statement also the

defendant went to the extent of pleading that on account of

administrative delays it had paid rent at old rate initially but

thereafter tendered the increased rent and specifically denied

that the whole idea of extension of lease was an after thought.

Even subsequent paragraphs of the written statement, read in

entirety leave no doubt that the defendant has throughout

been claiming himself to be in possession of the suit property

as a tenant with extended lease on an enhanced rent.

</p><p id="p_38">31.   Coming to the specific paragraph no. 19 of the written



CS/39/04                                      Page 20 of 27 pages

statement, which has been strongly relied upon by ld counsel

for defendant to show that the defendant had raised an

alternate plea of its possession as a purchaser. It was argued

by ld counsel for defendant that in para 19 of the written

statement a clear alternate plea has been raised that the

defendant is in possession of the suit property as a purchaser,

as such the specific plea of <a href="/doc/221518/" id="a_25">section 53A</a> Transfer of Property

Act now sought to be inserted would not cause any prejudice

to the plaintiff. It was argued that in para 19 of the written

statement, the defendant has specifically pleaded      that it is

entitled to remain in occupation of the suit property in terms

with agreement to sell and order dated 25/03/94 of the

Hon'ble High Court. But as discussed above, this paragraph of

written statement cannot be read in isolation from the

corresponding paragraph of plaint and rest of the written

statement. Even otherwise, it is not pleaded even in para 19 of

the written statement that possession of the suit property with

the defendant is as purchaser. On the contrary, the defendant

pleads protection under clause 3 of the lease deed as a tenant

on increase of rent. In para 19 of the plaint, it is specifically



CS/39/04                                      Page 21 of 27 pages
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">                                                              22</span>

pleaded that the defendant has always been in possession as

a lessee under the said lease till its expiry and thereafter it

became a trespasser. Defendant in the corresponding para 19

does not deny that till expiry of the lease his status was as a

lessee and rather pleads protection under clause 3 of the lease

deed.    In para 19 of the written statement, the defendant

basically pleads the currency of lease and consequently his

possession as a tenant. Even otherwise, if during currency of

lease the defendant was in possession as a tenant, there is

nothing on record that made his possession as a possession of

owner/purchaser upon expiry of lease deed.

</p><p id="p_39">32.     It would also be relevant to examine the agreement to

sell executed between the parties since the application under

consideration is based on the defendant's claim that it is in

possession as a purchaser in part performance of the

agreement.     As per clauses 6&amp;7 of the said agreement,

possession of the suit property was to be "handed over" to the

defendant at a much subsequent stage after completion of all

the formalities and till then legal possession as owner

continued to be with the plaintiffs while the defendant was to

occupy the suit property under the lease deed as a tenant

only.
</p>
<p id="p_40">33.     It is defendant's own case throughout the pleadings that

it kept extending the lease by virtue of clause 3 of the lease

deed. The agreement to sell was executed on 20/11/1989 and

cancelled on 28/12/93. Even as per defendant's case it not

just extended the lease but also paid enhanced rent. Even

after service of quit notice the defendant tendered enhanced

rent as per its own pleadings. The overall defence to the suit

is that the plaintiff unreasonably refused to renew the lease as

such the quit notice was bad in law. All these pleadings are

vital admissions made by the defendant that its possession in

the suit property is as a tenant and not as a purchaser in part

performance of agreement to sell and the amendment sought

seeks to withdraw these admissions.
</p>
<p id="p_41">34.     Although this amendment application came earlier in

point of time as compared to plaintiff's application under

Order XII Rule 6 CPC, it can not be denied that the

amendment,       if   allowed,   will   frustrate   the   plaintiff's

application.

</p><p id="p_44">35.   As per defendant's own case in the application under

consideration, the amendment has been sought simply

because of a "frivolous objection" raised by the plaintiff. In

other words, the amendment is otherwise not necessary as per

defendant's own understanding and rightly so. As discussed

in details in order dated 04/11/06 while disposing of the

preliminary issue, controversy in the present suit       is totally

distinct from the controversy in the suit pending before

Hon'ble High Court. Defence to the present suit as discussed

above is only to the extent that the plaintiff unreasonably

withheld consent to extend the lease. The amendment sought

is not necessary for determining the real question in

controversy between the parties to this suit.

</p><p id="p_45">36.   Besides, the relevance of the amendment sought also

has to be seen keeping in view that once in the order dated

04/11/06 this court ruled out the relevance of <a href="/doc/221518/" id="a_26">section 53A</a>

Transfer of Property Act, which order having not been

</p><p id="p_48">37.     As rightly pointed out by ld counsel for plaintiff, in the

name of inconsistent pleas the defendant cannot be allowed to

bring in a     plea   that is destructive of its already pleaded

defence. Defendant can be in possession of the suit property

(if not as trespasser) either as a tenant or as an owner. Each

of the plea of nature of possession is destructive of the other.

These    are   mutually    destructive   pleas   and   not    merely

to change his stand from the earlier defence of tenancy to an

entirely different plea of his being a trespasser since the

defendant could either be a tenant or a trespasser. In the case

of SHRI ARJAN DEV (supra) the defendant was not allowed to

take a stand that he has interest in the property as a member

of Joint Hindu family and at the same time to say that he is

owner by     way of   adverse possession. In the case          of

SURENDRA BHATIA (supra) the defendant, once having

admitted in written statement the factum of his marriage was

not allowed to take inconsistent plea of denying the aspect of

marriage itself.

JASWANT SINGH, JT</a> 1996(8) SC 292,             Hon'ble Supreme

Court held that the defendant can raise mutually inconsistent

pleas in the written statement but it is for the court to

consider whether the case can be properly considered in

deciding the issue. But mutually destructive pleas cannot be

allowed to be taken in the written statement by way of

amendment. The defendant of that case in the written

statement denied title of adoptive father of the plaintiff but by

way of amendment of written statement the defendant sought

to plead a gift made by the plaintiff in favour of defendant,

which plea would be destructive as the same would amount to

<p id="p_51">40.   To summarize, the amendment sought by the defendant

is not just unnecessary to decide the real controversy between

the parties, it is also not bonafide having been brought to

nullify the admissions of defendant that it is in possession of

the suit property as a tenant, on the basis of which plaintiff

has brought an application under Order XII Rule 6 CPC and

the amendment sought is destructive of the defence already

pleaded in the written statement.

frivolous and the same is dismissed with cost of Rs.2,000/-

in favour of the plaintiff.
