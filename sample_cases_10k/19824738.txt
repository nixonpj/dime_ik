             Mr. Gautam Kr. Maity ...                         for Petitioner.




</p><p id="p_3">                        Affidavit-of-service filed in Court today be

             kept with the record.

<p id="p_4">                        The     material       facts   of     the   case      are

             supported by records and hence I have not called for

             affidavits.
</p>
<p id="p_5">                        The husband of the petitioner was an

             assistant teacher in a primary school. He died-in-

             harness on 30th June, 1985 after completing more

             than 30 years of service.            The pension payment

             order was issued on 16th August, 2005.                           The

             petitioner approached the concerned authority for

             payment of interest on the delayed payment of

             pension.       Being unsuccessful, the petitioner has

             approached this Court.            In this writ petition she

             prays for interest on the delayed payment of

             pensionary benefit.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                           2</span><p id="p_6">


            It is now well settled that if there is a

delay in releasing the pensionary benefits to a

retired employee or to the legal heir of a deceased

employee, some amount of interest should be paid

to compensate for the delay in releasing the

benefits.     The pensionary benefits are welfare

measures meant to enable a retired employee or the

dependants of a deceased employee to live a life of

dignity.    Hence, it is imperative and of utmost

importance that such benefits are released to a

retired employee or the legal heir of a deceased

employee without any delay.        If there is delay,

interest at a reasonable rate is payable by way of

compensation.      This is not punitive but purely

compensatory.
</p>
<p id="p_7">            Although the point of delay or limitation

has not been urged on behalf of the State as none

appeared on its behalf, I deem it appropriate to

address that issue briefly.    <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_1">The Limitation Act</a> in

terms does not apply to writ petitions. The Hon'ble

Supreme Court in the case of Union of India Versus

Tarmen Singh reported in (2008) 8 SCC 648 has

observed that if the issue relates to payment or
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                           3</span>


refixation of pay or pension, relief may be granted in

spite of delay as it does not affect the rights of third

parties. It is settled law that the right of a retired

employee to get his retiral dues on the date of

attaining superannuation is a valuable right which

accrues in his favour on the date of his attaining

superannuation.      Further, pension is no more

considered to be a bounty to be handed out by the

State at its whim.     An employee has a       right to

receive pension upon retirement.        If payment of

such pension is delayed, the retired employee is

surely entitled to get some interest for such delayed

payment.
</p>
<p id="p_8">           The Rule that the High Court may not

enquire into belated and stale claim is not a Rule of

Law, but one of practice based on sound and proper

exercise of discretion.   The principle on which the

relief to a party is denied on the ground of laches or

delay is that the right which have accrued to others

by reason of delay in approaching the Court should

not be allowed to be disturbed. In the present case,

it was the bounden duty of the State to disburse the

pension amount on the due date. If it has failed to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                            4</span>


do   so   and   has    released   such     amount     after

unexplained delay, it is obliged to pay interest to the

retired employee. This is compensatory in nature.

Pension and gratuity are aimed at maintaining the

life of a retired employee and his/her dependents,

these are welfare provisions and even if there is

delay on the part of a retired employee to approach

the Court claiming interest on delayed payment of

pension, the delay per se should not be the ground

for rejection of the writ petition.      No third party

interest will be affected by a direction on the State to

compensate      the   retired   employee      for   delayed

payment of pension          by paying interest at a

reasonable rate.
</p>
<p id="p_9">          Learned counsel for the petitioner drew my

attention to a Memorandum dated November 1,

2010 issued by the School Education Department,

Budget Branch, Government of West Bengal.                The

said Memorandum pertains to pension / family

pension in respect of the employees who retired or

died-in-harness prior to April 1, 1981 and also those

employees    who      died-in-harness    or    retired    in

between the period from April 1, 1981 to June 30,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                          5</span>


1990 (both days inclusive) before exercising any

option under DCRB Scheme 1981. Paragraph 4 of

the said Memorandum provides inter alia, that the

financial benefit may be given with effect from June

15, 1990 or from the date of application for pension

/ family pension whichever is later.

</p><p id="p_10">          In the present case, the petitioner cannot

state with any certainty the date of application for

pension / family pension.     Hence, in view of the

aforesaid and also having regard to the decision of

the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of D.D.

Tewari (Dead) through legal representatives Vs.

Uttar Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam Limited &amp; ors., I

direct the Treasury Officer, Tamluk to pay interest

to the petitioner at the rate of 9% per annum on the

amount released in favour of the petitioner by way

of pensionary benefit on and from June 15, 1990 till

the date of issuance of Pension Payment Order.

</p><p id="p_11">          Such payment of interest is to be made

within eight weeks from the date of communication

of the certified copy of this order to the concerned

authorities.
</p>
<p id="p_12">          Since no affidavit-in-opposition has been
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                           6</span>


invited, the allegations contained in the writ petition

are deemed not to be admitted.
</p>
<p id="p_13">          WP No. 9237 (W) of 2017 is, accordingly,

disposed of.
</p>
<p id="p_14">          There will be no order as to costs.
</p>
<p id="p_15">          Urgent certified website copies of this

order, if applied for, be made available to the parties

upon compliance of the requisite formalities.
