</pre>
<p id="p_1">1.               This is a suit filed under Order XXXVII of The Code

defendants for recovery of sum of Rs.28,000/- (Rupees Twenty

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">CS No.122/2016             Rajeev Kumar Vs. Sanjay &amp; Anr.          Page 1 of 6</span>
 interest @ 24% per annum                in favour of the plaintif and
against the defendants.
</p>

<p id="p_2">2.               The summons of the suit were directed to be issued
to the defendants U/o 37 CPC in the prescribed form as
defined under Order 37 (2) (Sub Rule 2) CPC vide order dated
31.05.2016. Defendants were served with the summons of suit
on 04.08.2016. Thereafter, application under Order 37 Rule
3(4) CPC was filed on behalf of the plaintif for issuance of
summons for judgment. Defendants were served with the
summons for judgment on 01.02.2017. Despite service,
defendants did not file any leave to defend application till
date.
</p>

<p id="p_3">3.               I have heard the counsel for the plaintif and
perused the record.
</p>

<p id="p_4">4.           Brief facts of the case are that the defendants
approached the plaintif for constructing their house in the
month of September, 2015. An agreement entered into
between the the plaintif and defendants for constructing the
said house i.e. L-1st, 2650/178, Gali No.4, Sangam Vihar, New
Delhi and the same has been signed by both plaintif and
defendants.         As   per    agreement,          plaintif   agreed     to
construct/build the house of defendants on total sum of
Rs.90,000/-. Plaintif received Rs.1100/- as advance payment
after starting the construction, defendants gave Rs.50,900/-.
Plaintif constructed the said house of defendants and

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">CS No.122/2016             Rajeev Kumar Vs. Sanjay &amp; Anr.        Page 2 of 6</span>
 completed his work in November, 2015. Defendant had to pay
balance amount of Rs.38,000/-.               Upon request by plaintif,
defendant no.1 gave two post dated cheques one bearing
no.000007 dated 15.12.2015 of Rs.13,000/- and one bearing
no.000008 dated 15.01.2016 of Rs.15,000/- drawn on Bank of
India, Branch Karol Bagh after deducting the Rs.10,000/- from
the remaining balance. Defendants assured the plaintif that
the same would be encashed on its presentation and promised
to pay the remaining amount of Rs.10,000/-.
</p>

<p id="p_5">5.           After believing the defendants, plaintif presented
the first cheque on 17.12.2015 and second cheque on
18.01.2016 with his banker for enchashment but the same
were returned back with the remakrs "Payment Stopped by
Drawer" vide returning memo dated 24.05.2016.                  Plaintif
came to know that both cheques were signed by defendant
no.2 and same had been given by defendant no.1.                Plaintif
informed the defendants about the said cheques but both the
defendants avoided the plaintif on one pretext or other.
Plaintif requested the defendants for making the remaining
balance amount but defendants refused to make the same.
Thus, present suit was filed by the plaintif.
</p>

<p id="p_6">6.               The suit is based on a cheques and returning memo
which are also placed on record in original by plaintif. Hence,
the same is covered within the provisions of Order 37 CPC and
is also filed within limitation. There is no relief claimed by
plaintif which does not fall within the ambit of the provisions

<blockquote id="blockquote_5">          Order XXXVII Rule 3(5) CPC.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_6">                 The defendant may, at any time within ten days
          from the service of such summons for judgment, by

<p id="p_8">8.               In view of the above mentioned provisions of law, it
is clear that if the defendant makes default in entering his
appearance within ten days from the date of service of
summons upon him, the allegations as leveled in the plaint
shall be deemed to be admitted by him and if the defendant
has not applied for leave to defend within 10 days from
service of summons for judgment, plaintif shall be entitled to
judgment forthwith. As per record,                Defendants were served
with    the      summons      of   suit    on     04.08.2016.      Thereafter,
application under Order 37 Rule 3(4) CPC was filed on behalf
of the plaintif for issuance of summons for judgment.
Defendants were served with the summons for judgment on
01.02.2017. Despite grant of time, defendants did not file any
leave     to     defend   application      till   date.      Accordingly,    the
allegations made in the plaint are deemed to be admitted by
the defendants by fiction of law, entitling the plaintif to a
decree straightway.

<p id="p_9">9.               In view of aforesaid discussion, suit of the plaintif
is decreed for a sum of Rs.28,000/- (Rupees Twenty Eight
