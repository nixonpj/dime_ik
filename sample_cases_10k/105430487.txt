        HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE NAJMI WAZIRI

</pre><p id="p_1">1.      This petition impugns an order dated 4th October, 2012 passed by the
learned Rent Controller allowing the respondent/tenant‟s application for
leave to defend, in an eviction petition filed by the petitioner/landlord. The
latter had sought the tenanted premises i.e., House No. 1449/127-B, First
Floor, 100 Feet Road, Durgapuri, Delhi-110093 on the ground of bonafide
need, under <a href="/doc/367290/" id="a_1">section 14(1)(e)</a> of the Delhi Rent Control Act, 1958 ( "the
Act"). The impugned order had restricted the leave to defend only to the
issues of: whether the petitioners had bonafide requirement of the premises
and whether any other reasonable suitable accommodation was available to
them?
</p><p id="p_2">2.      It was submitted that the petitioners/landlords have four sons and a
daughter; that the elder son namely Parveen was married and residing
separately at C-543, Hanuman Mandirwali Road, Ashok Nagar, Delhi and



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">RC. Rev. 593/2012                                                Page 1 of 7</span>
 this residential accommodation was on a land admeasuring 50 sq. yds. and
was exclusively only for Parveen and his family; that in House No.
1449/127-B, 100 Feet Road, Durgapuri, Delhi-110093, the ground floor was
being used for dairy business, while the first floor was occupied by the
tenant; that out of the other three sons of the petitioners, Ravinder Kumar
and Pankaj (twins) were 23 years old and the other son namely Harinder
Kumar was 21 years of age, as on the date of filing of the eviction petition;
that were to marry, but due to lack of requisite accommodation, were
constrained from doing so; that even their pursuit of higher education was
said to be suffering because of lack of adequate space for studying. It was
also contended that their current accommodation had no guestroom thus,
causing the entire family, immense inconvenience and hardship whenever
the married daughter would visit them alongwith her husband. It was further
contended that although the premises was rented out for residential purpose,
it was malafidely being used by the tenant for commercial purposes.
</p><p id="p_3">3.      In the application for leave to defend, the tenant had averred that there
was no bonafide need and the petitioners were motivated only by avarice, to
re-let the vacated premises at a higher rent; that the eviction - petitioner had
a number of other properties from which they were earning „handsome‟
rents. A list of the following properties was given in support of this
contention: (i) property bearing No.C-550, Ashok Nagar, Gali No.7, (ii)
property bearing No.C-549, Ashok Nagar, Gali No.7, (iii) property bearing
No.C-543, Ashok Nagar, Gali No.7 and (iv) property bearing No.12/1, 40ft.
Road Krishan Vihar, Mandoli Road, Delhi. It was further contended that the
petitioners/landlords had two other properties in D Block, Ashok Nagar,
Delhi; that earlier on 10.06.2007, the landlords had forcibly tried to re-enter



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">RC. Rev. 593/2012                                                  Page 2 of 7</span>
 and take possession of the suit property against which an FIR No.317/2007
was registered with P.S. Mansarover Park and it was pending trial. It was
further contended that the property was taken on rent sometime in August,
1997; that rent was enhanced from time to time; that since May 2007, the
tenant was constrained to deposit the rent in the Court because the landlords
avoided accepting it. The landlords however, refuted these contentions and
submitted that no triable issue had been raised in the application.
</p><p id="p_4">4.      On the basis of a certified copy of the judgment dated 19.01.2011
filed by the tenants, pertaining to adjudication of a lis between the parties,
the Trial Court was of the view that the landlord-tenant relationship stood
established. The Trial Court bore in mind, the principle that it is not the
mere whims and desire that would form the basis of an eviction order but
instead the Court would be required to see that a bonafide need for the same
is existent and such need had to be seen in preasenti. It was observed that
the landlords had not disclosed as to why they had shifted from C-543,
Hanuman Mandir-wali Road, Ashok Nagar, Delhi to House No. 1449/127-
B, Second Floor, 100 Feet Road, Durgapuri, Delhi-110093. The Trial Court
was of the view that the landlords had admitted to their ownership of other
properties in Block „C‟, and that the reply to para 5 of the application for
leave to defend appeared to be bald. The Trial Court perused the FIR dated
10.6.2007 lodged with P.S. Mansarovar Park by the tenant against the
petitioners/landlords. The Trial Court held that change of user by the tenant
was of no consequence since the purpose of letting out the tenanted premises
was irrelevant in view of the Supreme Court‟s judgment in the case of
Satyawati Sharma (dead) by <a href="/doc/1703207/" id="a_2">LRs v. Union of India &amp; Anr</a>. 148 (2008)
DLT 705 (SC).       The Trial Court further relied upon the dicta of the



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">RC. Rev. 593/2012                                                 Page 3 of 7</span>
 Supreme Court in Charan Das v. Brahma Nand, 1982 (1) All India RCJ
789 which held that it is for the landlord to show as to how, despite the
availability of other properties, the same were insufficient. The Trial Court
further reasoned that where additional accommodation was sought, the
Courts should not ordinarily refuse leave to defend. The Court relied upon
the aforesaid judgment 19.1.2011 which showed that the petitioners were
residing at C-543, Hanuman Mandir-wali Road, Ashok Nagar, Delhi and not
at second floor of House No.1449/127-B, 100 Ft. Road, Durgapuri, Delhi-
110093. Therefore, it was held that the former property could well be
considered to be suitable alternative accommodation available to the
eviction-petitioners. The Trial Court found this to be a triable issue, hence
leave to defend was granted, albeit to a restricted extent.
</p><p id="p_5">5.      The learned counsel for the petitioners/landlords contended that the
learned Trial Court fell into error by not appreciating that every property
alleged by the tenant to have been owned by the landlords had been duly
replied to and accounted for. It was contended that pursuant to marriage of
The petitioners‟ elder son, Praveen and due to lack of accommodation for
his family, they had shifted from C-543, Hanuman Mandirwali Road, Ashok
Nagar, Delhi to House No. 1449/127-B, Second Floor, 100 Feet Road,
Durgapuri, Delhi-110093; that in property bearing House No. 1449/127-B,
100 Feet Road, Durgapuri, Delhi-110093, the ground floor is used for dairy
business and the second floor had only one room, kitchen and toilet which
evidently is not sufficient for the requirement of residence of the petitioners
and their three sons. It was further submitted that property bearing No. C-
550, Gali No.7, Ashok Nagar admeasuring approximately 55 sq. yds. and
not 70 sq. yds., had already been sold out by the petitioners on 15th



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">RC. Rev. 593/2012                                                 Page 4 of 7</span>
 December, 2003 to one Sh. Rampal Singh. It was further denied that
property bearing No. C-549, Gali No.7, Ashok Nagar admeasuring about
100 sq.yds. was ever owned by the petitioners. Apropos property bearing
No.C-543, Hanuman Mandirwali Road, Ashok Nagar, Delhi, it was argued
that the same was admeasuring 50 sq. yds. and not 60 sq. ydrs. and it was
occupied by the petitioners‟ elder son namely, Parveen. The ownership of
property No. 12/1, 40ft. Road Krishan Vihar, Mandoli Road, Delhi
admeasuring 500 sq.yds. was denied.          It was further denied that the
landlords were running a school therefrom. They also denied ownership of
any other property in D Block, Ashok Nagar, Delhi and submitted that the
said allegation of ownership of two other properties in Ashok Nagar was a
conjecture since no properties were specified. It was further submitted that
the tenant was the absolute owner of House No.84, Gali No.3, Durgapuri
Extension, Delhi and the same was being used for commercial purpose just
as the present tenanted premises.
</p><p id="p_6">6.      The learned counsel for the petitioners/landlords relied upon the
testimony of the tenant, being PW2 in FIR No.317/2007, where she had
admitted to her residence at the aforesaid address. Her testimony was that on
9.6.2007, she had closed the tenanted premises and went to her house which
was purchased six to seven years ago, built on a land area admeasuring
approximately 80 sq.yds. and is double storied. She had further stated that
she could not recall whether the present house was only residential.
</p><p id="p_7">7.      Having heard the learned counsel for the parties, this Court is of the
view that insofar as the landlord had specifically denied, both the ownership
and the availability of the alternate accommodations as alleged by the tenant
in para 5 of her leave to defend application, the Trial Court fell into error by



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">RC. Rev. 593/2012                                                 Page 5 of 7</span>
 treating the same as a mere bald denial. There is a detailed averment on each
of the additional properties mentioned in the leave to defend application.
The landlords‟ reply to the leave to defend application would show that the
said properties were not available to them. Therefore, the impugned order
suffers from material irregularity.
</p><p id="p_8">8.      Furthermore, insofar as the second floor of the property being House
No. 1449/127-B, 100 Ft. Road, Durgapuri, Delhi-110093 shows that there
was only one room, one kitchen and a latrine-bathroom, it would not be
sufficient for the requirement of the petitioners, their son aged 21 years, two
23 years old sons and one married daughter alongwith her family. Clearly,
the sons who were 23 years and 21 years of age at the time of filing of the
petition, would require at least one room each for themselves. Similarly, the
married daughter too would require a room for herself whenever she visits
her parents. Quite evidently, the bonafide need of the petitioners for the
tenanted premises was made out and they had shown that they had no
suitable alternate accommodation available to them, as alleged by the tenant
in the application for leave to defend. When the bonafide need has been
made out and no alternate accommodation was shown from the records,
clearly there was no dispute or triable issue raised in the application for
leave to defend. In these circumstances, it would be for the Trial Court to
pass an eviction order in a summary procedure envisaged under Section 25-
B of the Act.       The ratio of Satyawati Sharma (supra) extended the
applicability of the <a href="/doc/679372/" id="a_3">Delhi Rent Control Act</a> to commercial properties as well.
It does not however mean that a residential property could, by virtue of the
said judgment, be misused for commercial purpose. The said judgment also
does not lend legitimacy to conversion of leased residential accommodations



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">RC. Rev. 593/2012                                                 Page 6 of 7</span>
 for commercial purposes de hors proper consent and through due procedure.
</p><p id="p_9">9.      In view of the aforesaid, the impugned order dated 4.10.2012 is set
aside and an eviction order is passed against the respondent/tenant with
respect to the tenanted premises being first floor of House No. 1449/127-B,
100 Ft. Road, Durgapuri, Delhi-110093. The order shall come into effect
after the statutory period of six months as envisaged in the said Act. Insofar
as the leave to defend was pursued on frivolous grounds in an eviction
petition filed in the year 2011 and so defended in this Court too, the
respondents are put to costs of Rs.20,000/- to be paid to the petitioner within
a period of four weeks from today.
