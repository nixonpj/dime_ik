         parties.
</p>
<p id="p_2">         2.   The    present      petition    is directed            against         order        of
         detention dated 13.8.2016 passed by the respondent -
         detaining authority in exercise of powers conferred under
         section 3(2) of the Gujarat Prevention of Anti Social Activities
         Act, 1985 (for short "the Act") by detaining the petitioner -
         detenue as defined under section 2(b) of the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_3">         3.   Learned advocate for the detenue submits that the order
         of detention impugned in this petition deserves to be quashed
         and set aside on the ground of registration of five offences
         under <a href="/doc/1439698/" id="a_1">Sections 66(1)</a>B, 65-AE, 116-B, 81 and 98(C) of the
         Prohibition Act by itself cannot bring the case of the detenue
         within the purview of definition under <a href="/doc/1818930/" id="a_2">section 2(b)</a> of the Act.
         Further, learned advocate for the detenue submits that illegal
         activity likely to be carried out or alleged to have been carried
         out, as alleged, cannot have any nexus or bearing with the
         maintenance of public order and at the most, it can be said to
         be breach of law and order.                 Further, except statement of
         witnesses, registration of above FIR/s and Panchnama drawn
         in pursuance of the investigation, no other relevant and
         cogent material is on record connecting alleged anti-social
         activity of the detenue with breach of public order. Learned
         advocate for the petitioner further submits that it is not
         possible to hold on the basis of the facts of the present case
         that activity of the detenue with respect to the criminal cases
         had affected even tempo of the society causing threat to the
         very existence of normal and routine life of people at large or
         that on the basis of criminal cases, the detenue had put the
         entire social apparatus in disorder, making it difficult for
         whole system to exist as a system governed by rule of law by

         disturbing public order.
</p>
<p id="p_4">         4.   Learned AGP for the respondent State supported the
         detention order passed by the authority and submitted that
         sufficient material and evidence was found during the course
         of investigation, which was also supplied to the detenue
         indicate that detenue is in habit of indulging into the activity
         as defined under <a href="/doc/1818930/" id="a_3">section 2(b)</a> of the Act and considering the
         facts of the case, the detaining authority has rightly passed
         the order of detention and detention order deserves to be
         upheld by this Court.
</p>
<p id="p_5">         5.   Having heard learned advocates for the parties and
         considering the facts and circumstances of the case, it
         appears that the subjective satisfaction arrived at by the
         detaining authority cannot be said to be legal, valid and in
         accordance with law, inasmuch as the offences alleged in the
         FIR/s cannot have any baring on the public order as required
         under the Act and other relevant penal laws are sufficient
         enough to take care of the situation and that the allegations
         as have been levelled against the detenue cannot be said to be
         germane for the purpose of bringing the detenue within the
         meaning of <a href="/doc/1818930/" id="a_4">section 2(b)</a> of the Act.                 Unless and until, the
         material is there to make out a case that the person has
         become a threat and menace to the Society so as to disturb
         the whole tempo of the society and that all social apparatus is
         in peril disturbing public order at the instance of such person,
         it cannot be said that the detenue is a person within the
         meaning     of <a href="/doc/1818930/" id="a_5">section   2(b)</a>     of the         Act.          Except         general
         statements, there is no material on record which shows that
         the detenue is acting in such a manner, which is dangerous to
         the public order. In this connection, it will be fruitful to refer

                 C/SCA/1598/2017                                               JUDGMENT




         to a decision of the Supreme Court in Pushker Mukherjee
         v/s. State of West Bengal [AIR 1970 SC 852], where the
         distinction between 'law and order' and 'public order' has
         been clearly laid down. The Court observed as follows :
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">                      "Does the expression "public order" take in every kind of
                      infraction of order or only some categories thereof ? It is
                      manifest that every act of assault or injury to specific
                      persons does not lead to public disorder. When two people
                      quarrel and fight and assault each other inside a house or in
                      a street, it may be said that there is disorder but not public
                      disorder. Such cases are dealt with under the powers vested
                      in the executive authorities under the provisions of ordinary
                      criminal law but the culprits cannot be detained on the
                      ground that they were disturbing public order. The
                      contravention of any law always affects order but before it
                      can be said to affect public order, it must affect the
                      community or the public at large. In this connection we must
                      draw a line of demarcation between serious and aggravated
                      forms of disorder which directly affect the community or
                      injure the public interest and the relatively minor breaches
                      of peace of a purely local significance which primarily injure
                      specific individuals and only in a secondary sense public
                      interest. A mere disturbance of law and order leading to
                      disorder is thus not necessarily sufficient for action under
                      the Preventive Detention Act but a disturbance which will
                      affect public order comes within the scope of the Act."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_6">         6.   In view of above, I am inclined to allow this petition,
         because simplicitor registration of FIR/s by itself cannot have
         any nexus with the breach of maintenance of public order and
         the authority cannot have recourse under the Act and no other
         relevant and cogent material exists for invoking power under
         <a href="/doc/1472974/" id="a_6">section 3(2)</a> of the Act. In the result, the present petition is
         hereby allowed and the impugned order of detention No.
         J/MAG/PASA CASE NO.34/2016 dated 13.8.2016 passed by
         the respondent - detaining authority is hereby quashed and
         set aside.      The detenue is ordered to be set at liberty
         forthwith if not required in any other case.</p><pre id="pre_2">
