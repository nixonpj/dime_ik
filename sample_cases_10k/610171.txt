<p id="p_1">1.	RULE.
</p><p id="p_2">  Shri Parikh, learned advocate
waives service of notice of rule on behalf of respondent no. 3, who
is the main contesting party and who had contested the suit before
the learned trial Court.
</p> 


 


 

<p id="p_3">2.	Ms.
</p><p id="p_4">Pandit, learned advocate appearing on behalf of the applicant seeks
permission to delete respondents nos. 1 and 2 so far as the present
application is concerned as they have never appeared before the
learned trial Court and even during pendency of the suit, interim
injunction was modified at the instance of respondent no. 3 herein on
deposit of a sum of Rs. 5,25,000/- by respondent no. 3 herein. 
Permission is accordingly granted. Without prejudice to the rights
and contentions of the respective parties in the main First Appeal,
respondents nos. 1 and 2 are
hereby ordered to be deleted so far as the present application is
concerned.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_5">3.	The
present application has been preferred by the applicant-original
plaintiff for the interim relief to stay further implementation,
operation and execution of the judgment and decree dated 22/11/2010
passed by the learned City Civil Court at Ahmedabad in Civil Suit 
No. 1779/2007.  It is also further prayed to restrain respondent no.
3 from withdrawing Rs. 5,25,000/- deposited by respondent no. 3 with
the learned City Civil Court and restrain respondent no. 3 from
disposing of the flat as directed by this Court vide order dated
25/01/2008 in Appeal from Order No. 357/2007  pending hearing and
final disposal of the appeal.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_6">4.	It
appears that after the impugned judgment and decree passed by the
learned trial Court, respondent no. 3 has already disposed of the
flat.  Ms. Pandit, learned advocate appearing on behalf of the
applicant-original plaintiff has submitted that an appropriate
application shall be moved by the applicant to seek interim relief
against the subsequent purchaser.  Without expressing anything on
merits with respect to the same,  as and when such an application is
made, the same shall be considered in accordance with law on its own
merits.   
</p>
 


 


 

<p id="p_7">5.	Considering
the fact that main First Appeal is admitted and considering the
interim arrangement during pendency of the suit before the learned
trial Court as per the order passed by this Court dated 25/01/2008 in
Appeal from Order No. 357/2007 by way of interim relief respondent
no. 3 is hereby restrained from withdrawing the amount of Rs. 5,
25,000/- deposited by
respondent no. 3 with the learned City Civil Court at Ahmedabad
pursuant to the order dated 25/01/2008 in Appeal from Order No.
357/2007.  However, the learned trial Court is hereby directed to
invest the said amount in the name of the Nazir initially for a
period of five years in any nationalised Bank and continue to renew
the same as and when mature as the aforesaid Fixed Deposit shall be
with cumulative interest, meaning thereby, nobody shall be permitted
to withdraw the interest on the same.  
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_8">6.	With
this, the present application is allowed.  Rule is made absolute to
the aforesaid extent.  No cost.
</p>
