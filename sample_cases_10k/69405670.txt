               (SHUSHEEL Vs THE STATE OF MADHYA PRADESH)


18-11-2015

Shri Pradeep Naveria, learned counsel for the applicant.
Smt. Shobhna Sharma, learned Panel Lawyer for the respondent-</pre>
<p id="p_1">State.
</p><p id="p_2">Heard arguments.
</p><p id="p_3">Perused case diary and material on record.
</p><p id="p_4">This is the first bail application filed by the applicant under <a href="/doc/1783708/" id="a_1">Section
438</a> of the Cr.P.C for grant of anticipatory bail as he apprehends
his arrest in Crime No.499/2015 registered at Police Station
Amarwara, district Chhindwara, against him for the offences
punishable under <a href="/doc/1230184/" id="a_2">Sections 456</a>, <a href="/doc/203036/" id="a_3">354</a> and <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_4">354A</a> of the I.P.C.
As per the prosecution, on 10.10.2015 the complainant has lodged
a written report stating therein that in the night of 20.09.2015 she
was all alone in her house. At about 11:00 p.m., the applicant
knocked the door of her house. Thereupon, she opened the door.
The applicant entered in her house. She offered him a chair. After
a short while, he forcefully took her on the cot and there he
touched her body with sexual intent. Upon her protest, he fled
away from her house.
</p><p id="p_5">Learned counsel for the applicant submits that the complainant
has lodged the report after the delay of 20 days for which she has
not offered any cogent reason in her written report. It is also
submitted by him that the complainant is a 30 years old married
woman. It is also submitted by him that the police had not got her
statement recorded under <a href="/doc/497457/" id="a_5">Section 164</a> of the Cr.P.C. It is also
 submitted by him that it is a case of consent and the prosecutrix
lodged the false report against the applicant to defend herself
when she was seen in the company of the applicant at the time of
alleged incident. Upon these submissions, learned counsel prays
for grant of anticipatory bail to the applicant.
Learned Panel Lawyer opposes the prayer.
</p><p id="p_6">On due consideration of the facts and circumstances of the case
and the submissions raised on behalf of the parties by their
counsel, but without expressing any opinion on merits of the case,
I am of the view that it is a fit case for grant of anticipatory bail to
the applicant with certain conditions. Allowing his application, he is
directed to appear before the Investigating Officer on or before
03.12.2015 for interrogation and submission of documentary
proofs of his permanent residence and contact numbers, if any.
The Investigating Officer is ordered that if he arrests the applicant
in the aforesaid crime, he be released immediately on bail on his
furnishing a personal bond in the sum of Rs.30,000/- (rupees
thirty thousand only) with one solvent surety of the same
amount to his satisfaction. Further, the applicant is directed to
abide by the conditions enumerated in <a href="/doc/1692057/" id="a_6">Section 438(2)</a> of the
Cr.P.C. It is made clear that if the applicant fails to appear before
the Investigating Officer on the stipulated period, then this bail
order shall stand automatically cancelled.
Certified copy as per rules.
