H.L. Dattu, C. J:
</p>
<p id="p_6">       This is the second round of litigation by the very same petitioner who was

before this Court on an earlier occasion in O.P.No.35851 of 2000. This Court by

its order dated 2/8/2005 has disposed of the writ petition. The orders passed by this

Court is as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">              "        4. In order to provide remunerative prices

              to the coconut growers, Government through

              nodal agency NAFED is procuring copra in the

              price support operations at Minimum Support

              Price if the process fall below Minimum Support

              Price. We are of the                 view, considering the

              various steps taken by the State Government as

              well as the Central Government, this Court is not

              justified in giving any direction either to the State

              Government or to the Central Government. We

              are sure that the State Government would take

              appropriate action to help the coconut farmers in

              the State of Kerala. With the above observations,

              this original petition is disposed of."</blockquote><p id="p_7">

</p><p id="p_8">       2. The petitioner was not satisfied with the orders passed by this Court and

therefore, had filed a Special Leave Petition before the apex Court. The Special

Leave Petition came to be disposed of by the apex Court, holding that it may not

be appropriate at that stage to interfere with the decision of the High Court.

</p><p id="p_9">       3. Now once again the petitioner is before this Court for the very same

relief that is sought for in O.P.No.35851 of 2000,        disposed of 2nd of August

2005. The grievance of the petitioner appears to be that the respondents are not

taking appropriate steps to protect the interest of coconut farmers in Kerala.

</p><p id="p_10">       4.   In the earlier Writ Petition filed, petitioner's request was for issuing

mandamus to the Central Government from importing Palm Oil into the country to

the detriment of coconut growers. This Court, while dismissing the Writ Petition,

however, had observed that the State Government would take appropriate action to

protect the interest of coconut farmers in Kerala. In the present Writ Petition, it is

complained that even after 3 years, the State Government and the Central

Government have failed to honour the clear undertaking given before this Court.

</p><p id="p_11">       5. In our view, if for any reason the respondents have not complied with

the undertaking that they had given before this Court in the earlier Petition, the

petitioner has to file appropriate petition for appropriate relief.

</p><p id="p_12">       6. The principles of constructive res judicata apply even in a proceedings

under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1">Article 226</a> or 227 of the Constitution of India. The earlier petition filed by

the petitioner having been dismissed, it is not open to the petitioner to raise the

self same question in this Writ Petition again only on the purported ground that

this Court had stated while dismissing the petition that the Government would take

appropriate action to help the coconut farmers in the State of Kerala.

it is rejected.
