</pre><p id="p_1">VIBHU BAKHRU, J

</p><p id="p_2">1.     The petitioner has filed the present petition impugning an order
dated 02.02.2018 passed by the National Consumer Disputes Redressal
Commission (hereafter ‗NCDRC'), whereby the petitioner's applications,
inter alia, questioning the jurisdiction of the NCDRC to entertain the
Revision Petition preferred by the respondent no.2 (Karnataka Housing
Board - hereafter ‗KHB') was rejected. The petitioner also impugns
NCDRC's order dated 10.02.2017, whereby the Revision Petition
preferred by the KHB against an order passed by the State Commission
was allowed.

<p id="p_3">2.     The principal controversy involved in the present petition is




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">W.P.(C) 1746/2018                                             Page 1 of 21</span>
 whether a Revision Petition under <a href="/doc/86602/" id="a_1">Section 21</a> of the Consumer Protection
Act, 1986 (hereafter ‗the Act') is maintainable against an order passed by
the State Commission in an appeal preferred against an order of the
District Forum with regard to enforcing the orders passed in respect of the
consumer complaint.      The petitioner contends that the proceedings to
enforce an order passed in a consumer complaint is not an order in a
consumer dispute and, therefore, a Revision Petition under <a href="/doc/86602/" id="a_2">Section 21</a> of
the Act to challenge such order(s) would not lie before the NCDRC.
</p>
<p id="p_4">Factual Background

</p><p id="p_5">3.     The petitioner applied for allotment of a HIG-B flat under Self
Financing Housing Scheme at Kengeri, Bangalore.            Pursuant to the
petitioner's application, she was allotted flat no.116, Type-B on the first
floor by a letter dated 25.03.1992 issued by the KHB. Thereafter, KHB
sent a provisional allotment letter dated 23.04.1992 to the petitioner
informing her that the total cost of the flat was `3,15,000/-. The petitioner
was also informed of the dates on which the installments were required to
be paid.      In terms of the aforesaid provisional allotment letter, the
petitioner paid an aggregate amount of `2,67,750/- in four installments.
</p>
<p id="p_6">4.     On 24.06.1995, KHB sent another letter allotting her another flat in
lieu of residential flat allotted earlier. The petitioner was informed that
cost of the flat now allotted to her was `5,90,000/-. The petitioner was not
willing to pay the enhanced cost and sought refund of the amount paid by
her.    Accordingly, KHB refunded a sum of `2,67,750/- paid by the
petitioner after deducting a sum of `3,937/-.
</p>



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">W.P.(C) 1746/2018                                            Page 2 of 21</span>
<p id="p_7"> 5.     On 29.12.2005, the petitioner made a representation to KHB and
demanded refund of the balance amount of `3,937/-. She also sought
interest at the rate of 27% per annum from the date of deposit of the
installments till the date of payment as compensation on negligence. KHB
did not accede to the said demand.
</p>
<p id="p_8">6.     Aggrieved by the above, the petitioner filed a complaint before the
Consumer Redressal Forum, Bangalore Urban District, (hereafter ‗ the
District Forum') alleging deficiency in service and seeking compensation
for the same. The District Forum found in favour of the petitioner in
respect of her allegation of deficiency in service on the part of KHB and
by an order dated 21.12.2006 directed KHB to refund the amount of
`3,937/- and further directed KHB to pay interest at the rate of 12% per
annum on `2,67,750/- from the respective dates of installments paid by the
petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_9">7.     The petitioner was dissatisfied with the said order and filed an
appeal before the Karnataka State Consumer Dispute Redressal
Commission (hereafter ‗the State Commission') seeking enhancement of
the compensation awarded to her. The State Commission did not accept
the petitioner's contention and dismissed the petitioner's appeal by an
order dated 06.02.2007.
</p>
<p id="p_10">8.     Aggrieved by the order dated 06.02.2007 passed by the State
Commission, the petitioner preferred a Revision Petition before NCDRC,
which was also dismissed with costs of `10,000/- by an order dated
04.08.2011.
</p>



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">W.P.(C) 1746/2018                                          Page 3 of 21</span>
<p id="p_11"> 9.     The petitioner filed a Special Leave Petition against the order dated
04.08.2011 passed by the NCDRC - SLP(C) No.35226-35227 of 2011.
The Supreme Court granted leave and consequently, SLP was converted
into Civil Appeal (Civil Appeal No.6730-6731/2012). The said appeal was
allowed by the Supreme Court by an order dated 19.09.2012 and the
Supreme Court directed KHB to pay (i) interest at the rate of 18% per
annum on the sum of `2,67,750/-; (ii)         `50,000 as compensation for
deficiency in service; and (iii) `20,000 as litigation costs.
</p>
<p id="p_12">10.    The said order was transmitted to the District Forum for
enforcement of the order. The only controversy arising before the District
Forum was with regard to the calculation of the amount payable to the
petitioner. The petitioner claimed that she was entitled to an appropriate
amount refunded by KHB towards the interest. According to KHB, it had
refunded the amount paid by the petitioner and was thus liable to pay
interest from the dates on which the instalments were paid till the date of
refund of the principal amount. Both the parties submitted their memo of
calculation before the District Forum. The memo submitted by KHB was
rejected whilst, the memo of calculation of the petitioner was partly
accepted. Accordingly, by an order dated 16.08.2014, District Forum
directed KHB to pay a further sum of `1,07,057/- as on 14.08.2014
(instead of `3,58,749/- as claimed by the petitioner).
</p>
<p id="p_13">11.    Aggrieved by the same, KHB preferred an appeal before the State
Commission (Appeal No.1238/2014), which was allowed by an order
dated 01.03.2016.     The State Commission set aside the order dated
16.08.2014 passed by the District Forum in Execution Petition no.2/2014



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">W.P.(C) 1746/2018                                               Page 4 of 21</span>
 and held that the amount paid by KHB to the petitioner would have to be
appropriated first towards interest and accordingly, a sum of `2,67,750/-
paid by KHB is to be appropriated towards interest and the matter was
remanded to the District Forum to compute the amount payable to the
petitioner and a cost of `20,000/- was also imposed on KHB.
</p>
<p id="p_14">12.    Aggrieved by the aforesaid order, KHB preferred a Revision
Petition before NCDRC. The petitioner resisted the aforesaid appeal and,
inter alia, filed an application (IA No.299/2017) contended that the
Revision Petition was not maintainable as a Revision Petition did not
disclose any jurisdiction error on the part of State Commission passing the
order dated 01.03.2016.
</p>
<p id="p_15">13.    KHB's Revision Petition was allowed by NCDRC by an order dated
10.02.2017. NCDRC held that a sum of `2,67,750/- was to be
appropriated towards interest was contrary to the averments made in a
complaint.
</p>
<p id="p_16">14.    Thereafter, the petitioner filed another application (Miscellaneous
Application No.281/2017) before the NCDRC, inter alia, contending that
that the order dated 10.02.2017 be declared a nullity and the NCDRC has
no jurisdiction to entertain the Revision Petition. The petitioner prayed
that the Revision Petition alongwith the petitioner's application (RP
1362/2016 alongwith IA No.299/2017) be referred to a Larger Bench.
The petitioner filed another application (MA 283/2017) seeking transfer of
the execution applications pending before the District Forum, Bangalore
to District Forum, Delhi and further to transfer the matter pending before




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">W.P.(C) 1746/2018                                           Page 5 of 21</span>
 the State Commission, Bangalore to the State Commission, Delhi.
</p>
<p id="p_17">15.    The said applications (IA No.299/2017, MA 281/2017, MA
282/2017 and MA 283/2017) were dismissed by the NCDRC by a
common order dated 02.02.2018, which is impugned in the present
petition.
</p>
<p id="p_18">Submissions

</p><p id="p_19">16.    The principal contention advanced by the petitioner, who appears in
person, is that, a Revision Petition under <a href="/doc/86602/" id="a_3">Section 21</a> of the Act is not
maintainable against an order of the State Commission passed in appeal
relating to enforcement of an order. The petitioner has relied upon the
decision of the Full Bench of the Andhra Pradesh in <a href="/doc/1485764/" id="a_4">Guntupalli Rama
Subbayya v. Guntupalli Rajamma</a>: AIR 1988 AP 226, wherein the Court
had held that execution proceedings could not be considered as a
continuation of suit. She also relied on the decision of the Full Bench of
the Patna High Court in <a href="/doc/992529/" id="a_5">Masomat Narmada Devi and Anr. v. Ram
Nandan Singh and Ors</a>.: AIR 1987 Patna 33 in support of the aforesaid
contention.
</p>
<p id="p_20">17.    She further contended that a consumer dispute would only mean a
dispute with regard to deficiency in service and an order passed for
enforcement of an order relating a consumer complaint would not fall
within the definition of the term ‗consumer dispute' and, therefore,
NCDRC would have no jurisdiction to entertain a Revision Petition under
<a href="/doc/862263/" id="a_6">Section 21(b)</a> of the Act. She referred to the decision of the Supreme
Court in <a href="/doc/518110/" id="a_7">Economic Transport Organization v. M/s Charan Spinning




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">W.P.(C) 1746/2018                                          Page 6 of 21</span>
 Mills (P) Ltd. &amp; Anr</a>.: Civil Appeal No.5611/1999 in support of her
contention.
</p>
<p id="p_21">18.    Mr Mrigank Prabhakar, learned counsel appearing for the KHB
countered the aforesaid submissions made by the petitioner. He submitted
that the present petition is not maintainable as the petitioner had an
alternative remedy of filing a review petition before NCDRC and/or a
special leave petition before the Supreme Court.
</p>
<p id="p_22">19.    Next, he submitted that the proceedings for enforcement of the
decision of the Supreme Court in the complaint filed by the petitioner was
also an extension of a consumer dispute and, therefore, NCDRC would
have the jurisdiction to exercise its revisional powers under <a href="/doc/862263/" id="a_8">Section 21(b)</a>
of the Act.         He relied on the decision Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/144900/" id="a_9">Dokku
Bhushayya v. Katragadda Ramakrishnayya &amp; Others</a>: (1963) 2 SCR 499
in support of the contention that proceedings in execution of a decree were
extension of the suit. He also relied on the decisions of the Bombay High
Court in <a href="/doc/1078712/" id="a_10">Satguru Construction Co. Pvt. Ltd. &amp; Others v. Greater
Bombay Co-Operative Bank Ltd</a>.: 2007 (3) M.h.L.J 843; and <a href="/doc/1337097/" id="a_11">Raghunath
R. Shingate v. Jayant Gajanan Pathak and Others</a>: 2011 (6) M.h.L.J
799 and decision of the Patna High Court in <a href="/doc/1776521/" id="a_12">M/s Parshava Properties Ltd.
v. A. K. Bose</a>: AIR 1979 Pat 308, wherein the Courts had observed that
execution proceedings were continuation of the suit.
</p>
<p id="p_23">Reasons and Conclusion

</p><p id="p_24">20.    At the outset, it is relevant to observe that the right to file an appeal
or file a revision is a statutory right, conferred by the statute; such rights
are not inherent and cannot be assumed to exist in absence of specific



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">W.P.(C) 1746/2018                                               Page 7 of 21</span>
 statutory provisions. Thus, the question whether the NCDRC has the
jurisdiction to entertain the Revision Petition filed by KHB has to be
examined by referring to the relevant provisions of the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_25">21.    <a href="/doc/86602/" id="a_13">Section 21</a> of the Act, which provides for jurisdiction of the
NCDRC is relevant and reads as under:-

</blockquote><p id="p_31">30.    Given the aforesaid scheme of the Act, it is clear that the
consumer dispute, which commenced with filing of the complaint and
denial by KHB, culminated in the order passed by the District Forum
on 21.12.2006. The said order was carried in an appeal before the
State Commission; to NCDRC; and thereafter to the Supreme Court. It
finally culminated in the order dated 19.09.2012 passed by the
Supreme Court. It is well settled that the appellate proceedings are of
continuation of the original proceedings and thus, the order passed by
District Forum merged with the order passed the Supreme Court.
Thus, insofar as the consumer dispute is concerned the same stands
adjudicated in terms of the findings of the District Forum as merged
with the order of the Supreme Court passed on 19.09.2012.

       and the National Commission are set aside and the order
       passed by the District Forum stands modified to the
       extent above.‖

</blockquote><p id="p_33">32.    As is apparent from the above, the Supreme Court had directed
KHB to pay the amount as indicated in its order, within a period of
four weeks from the date of receipt of the said order. The proceedings
before the District Forum in E.P. No. 02/2014 were for enforcement of
the said order. Before the District Forum, both the parties, the
petitioner as well as KHB, submitted their respective statement of
calculation of the amount payable. According to the petitioner, the
amount received by her was required to be appropriated first towards
the interest payable and thereafter, towards the principal amount.
According to KHB, it had paid the principal amount and thus, was
required to pay only interest on the same. Plainly, this controversy
does not fall within the scope of the consumer dispute but is related to
interpretation of the order(s) passed in the said dispute.

<p id="p_34"> 33.    The nature of execution proceedings is materially different from
the nature of the proceedings for adjudication of the complaint. The
said proceedings are independent proceedings. As noticed above, the
consumer dispute culminates in the findings of the District Forum. As
indicated by the opening sentence of <a href="/doc/1434688/" id="a_22">Section 14(1)</a> of the Act, the said
order is passed ―after the proceedings conducted under <a href="/doc/1977503/" id="a_23">Section 13</a>‖.
Thus, insofar as the consumer dispute is concerned, it stands
determined by an order passed under <a href="/doc/550350/" id="a_24">Section 14</a> of the Act. Orders
passed for execution of any order passed under <a href="/doc/550350/" id="a_25">Section 14</a> would

 any proceedings, which can be properly regarded as continuation of a
suit. In this context, execution proceedings could not be regarded as
continuation of a suit and any order of determination in such
proceedings would not be appealable. The relevant extract of the said
decision is set out below:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_46">         ―That the law laid down in Parshava Properties' case
         (AIR 1970 Pat 308) (supra) is no more good law
         should have been a good answer to the learned
         counsel's contention, but the learned counsel submits
         that dehors the decision in Parshava Properties' case
         (supra), his contention that the order in question finally
         determines the rights of the parties in controversy in
         the EP which is continuation of suit, and therefore
         amounts to ‗decree' within Sec. 2(2) may be
         considered. We fail to see any force in this submission.
         From the definition of decree in Sec. 2(2), it is manifest
         that the determination must relate to the matters
         controversy in the suit or in the proceedings which can
         properly be regarded as continuation of the suit.
         Execution Proceedings, in our view, cannot be
         regarded as continuation of the suit in the sense in
         which the proceedings in appeal are treated. As long
         back as in 1898 it was observed in Venkata v.
         Venkataramana, ILR (1898) 22 Mad 256 that the
         execution proceeding though proceeding in a suit, is
         not a suit. As noticed above, though the proposition
         that the execution proceedings are continuation of the
         suit, found favour with the Division Bench of the Patna
         High Court in Parshava Properties' case (supra), the
         Division Bench of this court in Challa Ramamurthy's
         case (supra) dissented from it and took the view that
         the execution proceedings started when the suit ended
         and in the context the suit could not be given meaning
         so as to include the proceedings in execution. In our
         view Execution proceedings are independent

          proceedings. They may be initiated in a suit but they
         are not in continuation of suit. They are taken to
         execute, the decree passed in the suit either at the
         original stage or at the appellate stage but they do not
         culminate in a decree. They cannot therefore, be treated
         as in continuation of the suit, much less as a suit. We
         are, therefore, in entire agreement with the view
         expressed by the Division Bench of this Court in
         Challa Ramamurthy's case (AIR 1985 Andh Pra 42)
         (supra) on this aspect and the Division Bench of
         Gujarat High Court in Hansumatiben v. Ambalal
         Krishnalal Parikh, AIR 1982 Guj 324. With respect we
         agree with the view taken by the Full Bench of the

be held that orders under<a href="/doc/1733066/" id="a_33"> S. 47</a> cannot be equated with matters, in
controversy in the original suit itself.‖

</p><p id="p_39"> 38.    This Court is also of the view that as nature of enforcement
proceedings is materially different from the proceedings for
adjudication of the dispute. Any orders passed for enforcement of
orders passed by the District Forum, State Commission or NCRDC
cannot be construed as orders passed in a ‗consumer dispute' that
stands finally adjudicated.
</p>
<p id="p_40">39.    The decision of the Supreme Court in Dokku Bhushayya
(supra) is of little assistance to KHB. In that case, the Supreme Court
was construing the provisions of Order 32 Rule 7 of CPC. Clause 1 of
Order 32 Rule 7 of CPC provides that no next friend or guardian for a
minor shall enter into any agreement or compromise on behalf of a
minor "with reference to the suit", without leave of the Court. The
words ―reference to the suit‖ are expansive and would also include
proceedings in relation to the said suit. It is in this context that the
Supreme Court had observed that execution proceedings are extension
of the suit. There is no doubt that proceedings for enforcement of
orders is also part of the proceedings initiated by a complainant.
However, that does not mean that orders passed in the context of
enforcement of the orders adjudicating the consumer dispute, are also
orders in that consumer dispute.

<p id="p_41">40.    The petitioner's contention that NCDRC would have no
jurisdiction to entertain the Revision Petition against the orders of the
State Commission passed in appeal against the order of the District
Forum, is merited.

<p id="p_42"> 41.    In view of the above, the impugned orders passed by NCDRC
are set aside. The petition is disposed of. The pending application is
also disposed of.
