<pre id="pre_1">               IN THE COURT OF SH. M.R. SETHI,
              ADDITIONAL DISTRICT JUDGE, DELHI.


RCA NO: 17/06.



State Bank of India
                                       ...........Appellant


Versus


M/s Sarabjit Kaur Mongia &amp; Anr.
                                       ............Respondent.




: JUDGMENT:
</pre>


<p id="p_1">1         By way of present appeal, the appellant has challenged

order dated 16-2-2006 passed by Learned Court of Shri Brijesh

Kumar Garg, Civil Judge, Delhi in M-22/05. By way of impugned

order, Learned trial court was pleased to dismiss an application

under Order 9 Rule 9 CPC read with Sec.151 CPC filed by the

plaintiff/appellant.
</p>
<p id="p_2">

2         Notice of appeal was sent to the respondents and trial

court record summoned. Arguments as advanced at the bar have

been heard.
</p>
<p id="p_3">

3         As per facts, plaintiff/appellant had filed a suit for



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                 1</span>
 recovery of Rs.1,29,546=18Paise against the defendants. Vide order

dated 26.4.05, as none appeared on behalf of plaintiff, while both

the defendants had appeared, the Suit No.11/05 was dismissed in

default by learned Court of Shri Raj Kumar Chouhan,Commercial

Civil Judge. As per case of the appellant, learned counsel for

appellant had inquired the date of hearing on 6.4.05 and had

wrongly noted down the next date of hearing as 29.4.05 instead of

26.4.05. It was case of the appellant that the suit was dismissed in

default on 26.4.05 and that learned counsel for appellant came to

know about the same on 29.4.05 and subsequently moved

application under Order 9 Rule 9 CPC on 02.5.05. The said

application had been dismissed vide the impugned order. Learned

counsel submitted that the suit got dismissed in default due to

wrong noting of the next date of hearing by counsel for plaintiff and

that plaintiff should not be made to suffer for the same. It was

further pointed out that there had been no delay in either filing the

application under Order 9 Rule 9 CPC nor filing the present appeal.



4        Ld. counsel for respondents argued to the contrary and

submitted that the appeal ought not to be accepted as the plaintiff

had intentionally failed to appear on the date of hearing and had

not shown any justified ground for non-appearance on 26.4.05. It

was further submitted that case diary or the file of learned counsel

for plaintiff had not been filed alongwith the application which was

disposed off vide the impugned order.
</p>
<p id="p_4">

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                  2</span>
 5         I have given my thoughtful consideration to arguments

advanced and have also perused the records. At the outset it may

observe that the application under Order 9 Rule 9 CPC had been

moved by the plaintiff and was accompanied with affidavit of Shri

R. K. Pruthi Advocate, Ld counsel for plaintiff/appellant. Learned

counsel for appellant had owned the entire responsibility for non-

appearance of anyone on behalf of plaintiff on 26.4.05.



6         Apparently, there had been no delay in filing the

application under Order 9 Rule 9 CPC which, in fact had been filed

within a week of the suit      having been dismissed in default. It

should not be lost sight of that plaintiff in this case State Bank of

India and the money, recovery of which is being sought is public

money.
</p>
<p id="p_5">

7         Keeping in view of the aforesaid facts and circumstances

of present case,this court is of considered opinion that it is a fit

case for acceptance of the appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_6">

8         Accordingly, the appeal is accepted and the impugned

order dated 16.2.06 passed by learned court of Shri Brijesh Kumar

Garg, in M-22/05 is quashed. Consequently, suit of the plaintiff

stands restored to its original position. However, all this would be

subject   to   plaintiff's   paying       cost   of   Rs.1500/-   to   the



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                      3</span>
 defendants/respondents.
</p>
<p id="p_7">

    9        Parties are directed to appear before Ld. Senior

    Civil Judge on 30.8.2007 and thereafter, after the cost is

    duly paid by the appellant to the respondents, learned

    Senior Civil Judge may either try the matter himself or

    mark it over to some other court of competent jurisdiction.

    Copy of judgment alongwith trial court record be sent to

    Learned Senior Civil Judge so as to reach there on or

    before 30.8.2007. Appeal file be separated, consigned to

    record room.
