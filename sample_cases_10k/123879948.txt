            The petitioner's husband, who is a life convict

named Sherif A, had undergone two major surgical

interventions at the CMC, Vellore. Once again, he has been

referred by the Consultant Radiologist of the Sree Chitra

Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences and Technology,

Thiruvananthapuram, to the Department of Radiation

Oncology,      CMC,        Vellore,       vide     Ext.P6       letter    dated

06.12.2017.
</p>
<p id="p_2">     2.     The learned Public Prosecutor has produced the

details of the medical treatments given to the said convict
WPC.3237/2018
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                :2 :</span>



and also the details of the paroles granted to him. It is true

that on several occasions, parole was granted to the said

convict for undergoing the medical treatment.

</p><p id="p_3">     3.    Even       though   the     present   Medical   Board

constituted      at     the    Medical      College    Hospital,

Thiruvananthapuram is of the opinion that he could be

managed         by     the     Medical      College    Hospital,

Thiruvananthapuram or Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for

Medical Sciences and Technology, Thiruvananthapuram, it is

a fact that as per Ext.P6 dated 06.12.2017, he has been

referred to the CMC, Vellore for better management, by the

Consultant Radiologist of the Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for

Medical Sciences and Technology, Thiruvananthapuram.

Once again, he has to undergo a surgery there. When two

surgical interventions were done at the CMC, Vellore, it is

better to have the next surgical intervention also at the

CMC, Vellore, as recommended in Ext.P5 discharge

summary from the CMC, Vellore as well as Ext.P6 referral
WPC.3237/2018
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                :3 :</span>



letter issued from the      Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for

Medical Sciences and Technology, Thiruvananthapuram.

</p><p id="p_4">     In the result, this writ petition is disposed of by

directing the 3rd respondent to grant medical parole to the

husband of the petitioner for 30 days for his medical

treatment at CMC, Vellore. All the expenses for the travel

and treatment shall be met by the petitioner or the convict.
