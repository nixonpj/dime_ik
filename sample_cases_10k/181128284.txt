PRAMOD KUMAR SHUKLA                                                 ......Petitioner
                Through:                     Mr. Rajesh Ranjan, Advocate.


                            VERSUS


D.S.A.C.S. &amp; ORS.                                        ...... Respondents
                            Through:

CORAM:
HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE VALMIKI J.MEHTA

    To be referred to the Reporter or not?


VALMIKI J. MEHTA, J (ORAL)

1.             Petitioner was appointed with the respondent No.1/Delhi State

AIDS Control Society as a Technical Officer for the first time vide appointment

letter dated 7.10.2011. Appointment admittedly was on contract basis for one

year and contract was terminable before the expiry without giving any reason by

giving a 7 days notice. Petitioner's contract was thereafter renewed for three

months after expiry of one year period vide office order dated 17.10.2012 and

this order specifically mentioned that contract is renewed only for three months

to give an opportunity to the petitioner Sh. Pramod Kumar Shukla to improve

WPC No. 3064/2013                                                              Page 1 of 4
 his performance. The petitioner's contract was thereafter not renewed because

the petitioner's services were found to be lacking.


2.            I may note that the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare,

National AIDS Control Organization has specifically issued a circular dated

15.11.2010 specifying that appointments should only be on contract basis and

extensions have to be considered only as per the evaluation of the services of the

employees. This circular is filed as Annexure J to the writ petition.


3.            By the writ petition, the petitioner claims that he should be given

further contract of services and his services should not have been terminated

inasmuch as petitioner had done his job properly and he was duly qualified.

Reliance is placed upon a letter dated 18.4.2013 issued by the Additional Project

Director of the respondent No.1 giving a certificate as under:-


        "Ref. No.F2(T004)/DSACS/Admn./11/623               Dated: 18/4/13
                           To Whom It May Concern
               Certified that Sh. Pramod Shukla S/o Sh. Krishna Swaroop
     Shukla R/o B-40, Room No.32, Christian Colony, Patel Chest, University
     of Delhi, 07 has worked as Technical Officer (SRL) in Delhi State AIDS
     Control Society from 07-10-2011 to 04-03-2013 purely on contractual
     basis and was drawing a fixed remuneration of `24250/- (` Twenty Four
     Thousand Two Hundred Fifty Only) per month. His work and conduct is
     satisfactory.
        We wish him all success in his life.

WPC No. 3064/2013                                                           Page 2 of 4
                                        (Dr. A.K. Gupta)
                          Addl. Project Director, DSACS"


             It is argued that once this certificate said that the work and conduct

of the petitioner was satisfactory, the petitioner's services ought to have been

extended beyond 16.1.2013.


4.           In my opinion, once the services of the petitioner stood terminated

w.e.f 17.1.2013 giving of the aforesaid certificate letter dated 18.4.2013 to help

the petitioner to find a new job cannot mean that respondent No.1 was not

justified in not extending the contract of service on account of inadequate

performance of the petitioner. That the petitioner's performance was inadequate

is clear from the extension order dated 17.10.2012 which specifically stated that

the petitioner had to improve his performance and which performance was

found to be lacking as reported by Centre I/C.      No benefit can also be

derived by the petitioner from the certificate dated 18.4.2013 as if the petitioner

was continued till 4.3.2013 inasmuch as admittedly there is no contract or

extension of contract for any period after 17.1.2013 much less till 4.3.2013.

However since there is a certificate of working of the petitioner till 4.3.2013,

and for which no extension order has been shown to me, in case the petitioner

has worked with the respondent No.1 till 4.3.2013, petitioner will be
WPC No. 3064/2013                                                          Page 3 of 4
 compensated by the respondent No.1 for working from 17.1.2013 till 4.3.2013 in

accordance with the Rules.

5.           This Court cannot sit in armchair of the competent authority to

decide the satisfaction of the services of an employee. The employer is best

suited to decide the suitability of an employee. In the present case, I do not find

that any grave reasons exist for this Court to substitute its own opinion for that

of the employer as per which the petitioner's services were found to be lacking

and therefore no extension of contractual services was granted.

6.           The writ petition is accordingly dismissed subject to the

observations that in case the petitioner has worked from 17.1.2013 to 4.3.2013,

the respondent No.1 will compensate the petitioner in accordance with the Rules

of the respondent No.1.
