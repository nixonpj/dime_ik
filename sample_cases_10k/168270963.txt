                               PRESENT

         THE HON'BLE JUSTICE SMT. SHEEMA ALI KHAN

                                 ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">Sheema Ali Khan, J.              The admitted facts in this case are that Ghussu

                      Mian and Sharafat Hussain had jointly purchased 2 kathas

                      2 dhurs of land appertaining to C.S. Plot No. 489,. Khata No.

                      50, situated in village Bahbalpur in the district of Gaya.

                      Sharafat Hussain is said to have sold his share to Umar

                      Hayat on 17.04.1965. Umar Hayat died and was survived by

                      his widow and two daughters. In the mean time, Ghussu

                      Mian sold the entire lands i.e. 2 kathas 2 dhurs to

                      respondent no. 4 through a registered sale deed dated

                      17.04.1975. The petitioner is the purchaser from the widow
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                   2</span>




and two daughters of Umar Hayat by a registered sale deed

dated 16.03.1989.
</p>
<p id="p_2">            In the revisional survey, the name of Ghussu

Mian was recorded which was challenged by this petitioner

by filing an application/objection before the Consolidation

Officer. The Consolidation Officer, on considering all the

facts, held that Ghussu Mian did not have the authority to

sell the entire lands as he had title only to half of the dispute

lands i.e. 1 katha 1 dhur. It would be apparent on perusal of

the order sheet that Umar Hayat, Sharafat Hussain and

Ghussu Mian were brothers. After the death of Umar Hayat,

the property would be divided according to the Muslim Law

amongst the heirs of Umar Hayat. The widow would be

entitled to two annas share and the two daughters would be

entitled to the half of the property. In any event, Ghussu

Mian would not be entitled to the entire property of his

brother. Thus, the Consolidation Officer and the Deputy

Director, Consolidation, Gaya have rightly held that the sale

deed executed by Ghussu Mian, dated 17.05.1975 for the

entire property is partly a void document and he could have

only executed the sale deed to the extent of his share.

</p><p id="p_3">            The Director, Consolidation has misdirected

himself inasmuch as he has come to a finding that since the

sale deed executed on 17.04.1975 was earlier in time, it

would be valid as against the sale deed executed on
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                   3</span>




16.03.1989 by the heirs of Umar Hayat. The findings of the

Deputy Director, Consolidation cannot be upheld by this

Court as it is not based on any legal premises.

</p><p id="p_4">            On behalf of the respondent no. 4, it has been

argued that the Deputy Director, Consolidation has rightly

observed that the validity of the sale deed cannot be

considered by the Consolidation Authorities.

</p><p id="p_5">            I would like to refer the judgment passed by the

Supreme Court in the case of <a href="/doc/608210/" id="a_1">Gorakh Nath Dube vs. Hari

Narain Singh &amp; Others</a> reported in AIR 1973 SC 2451,

wherein it has been held by the Supreme Court that while

considering the sale deed, it is perfectly acceptable that the

Consolidation Authorities may look into the sale deed and if

it is found to be void document, it may be set aside. In the

case referred to above, the challenge was that one of the

parties had sold the lands in excess of his share. The

Consolidation Officer held that it is a void document and,

therefore, came to a conclusion that the co-sharer could not

have sold lands beyond his share.
</p>
<p id="p_6">            In   view of the aforesaid facts, I find that the

document (sale deed) dated 17.04.1975 is partly          a void

document as Ghussu Mian would only be entitled to sell his

own share, including what he has inherited on the death of

his brother to respondent no. 4. Similarly, the petitioner

would also be entitled to transfer his share of lands.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                    4</span>




</p><p id="p_7">                             In the result, the order of the Joint Director,

                 Consolidation, Gaya dated 31.07.1991 passed in Case No.

                 348 of 1990 is set aside.
</p>
<p id="p_8">                             This writ application is accordingly allowed in

                 the terms aforesaid.
