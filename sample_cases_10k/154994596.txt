                       The High Court of Madhya Pradesh
                                MP 4805 of 2019
                  <a href="/doc/39734936/" id="a_1">Smt. Usha Shrivastava vs. State of MP and Ors.

Gwalior</a>, dtd. 17/09/2019
      Shri Anmol Khedkar, Counsel for the petitioner.

      Shri Pawan Singh Raghuvanshi, Government Advocate for the State.

      This petition under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_2">Article 227</a> of the Constitution of India has been

filed against the order dated 21/08/2019 (Annexure P1) passed by Fourth

Additional District Judge, Dabra, District Gwalior in Civil Appeal No.14-A of

2013, by which the application filed by the petitioner under Order 6 Rule 17 of

CPC for amendment in the plaint has been rejected on the ground that not only

the application is filed belatedly, but the petitioner has not contended that in

spite of due diligence he could not get the information.

(2)    The necessary facts for disposal of the present petition in short are that

the petitioner had filed a suit for declaration of title and mandatory injunction.

It was her case that she is the owner and in possession of the house situated at

Kamleshwar Colony, Ward No.19, Dabra, District Gwalior and during the

encroachment drive of 2011, the Municipal Council, Dabra, District Gwalior

gave a notice to the petitioner that she has encroached upon 11.6 ft x40 ft area,

which is part of 50 ft wide road sanctioned in the master plan of 1943.

Initially, the suit was filed for permanent injunction only. However, as the

application filed by the petitioner under Order 39 Rule 1 &amp; 2 of CPC was

rejected by Trial Court, therefore, the Municipal Council, Dabra demolished

the house of the petitioner and the suit was amended and relief of mandatory
                                           2

injunction was also incorporated to restore the previous position of the house

of the petitioner which was existing at the time of filing of suit. The written

statement was filed by the respondents and the Trial Court, after recording the</pre>

<p id="p_1">evidence, dismissed the suit.
</p>
<p id="p_2">(3)    Being aggrieved by the judgment and decree dated 31/03/2013 passed

by the Trial Court, the petitioner filed an appeal. The petitioner filed an

application under Order 6 Rule 17 of CPC on 04/01/2018 i.e. after five years

of filing of appeal. It was the case of the petitioner that she had obtained an

information under the Right to <a href="/doc/1965344/" id="a_3">Information Act</a> which was provided to her by

letter dated 27/10/2014 and it was informed that no master plan was in

existence from 1943 till 2014 and, therefore, it is not possible for supply the

said document.
</p>
<p id="p_3">(4)    The application filed by the petitioner for amendment in the plaint was

opposed by the respondents.
</p>
<p id="p_4">(5)    The Appellate Court by the impugned order dated 21/08/2019 has

rejected the application filed under Order 6 Rule 17 of CPC.

(6)    Challenging the order passed by the Appellate Court, it is submitted by

the counsel for the petitioner that the petitioner has also filed an application

under Order 41 Rule 27 of CPC which was allowed and thus, when the

Appellate Court has taken the additional document on record, then the Court

below committed material illegality by rejecting the application filed under

Order 6 rule 17 of CPC because in absence of the pleadings, the documents

cannot be considered. Further, it was submitted that the application for
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                           3</span>

amendment can be allowed at any stage.
</p>
<p id="p_5">(7)    Heard the learned Counsel for the petitioner.

(8)    The petitioner has placed the copy of the application under Order 41

Rule 27 of CPC. From the said application, it is clear that the reply dated

27/10/2014 on the basis of which the pleadings were sought to be amended,

was not filed along with such application. Thus, it is clear that by allowing the

application under Order 41 Rule 27 of CPC, the Appellate Court has not taken

the reply dated 27/10/2014 on record. Thus, the contention made by the

counsel for the petitioner that although the Appellate Court has allowed the

application under Order 41 Rule 27 of CPC but has refused to allow the

petitioner to amend the pleadings, is misconceived. No pleadings were sought

to be amended in the light of the documents which have been taken on record

by the Appellate Court under Order 41 Rule 27 of CPC.

(9)    So far as the question of amendment in the plaint at the appellate stage

is concerned, the petitioner has relied upon the judgment passed by the

Supreme Court in the case of <a href="/doc/1893329/" id="a_4">Revajeetu Builders and Developers vs.

Narayanaswamy and Sons and Others</a>, reported in (2009) 10 SCC 84,

Chakreshwari Construction Pvt. Ltd. vs. Manohar Lal, reported in 2017

(3) MPLJ 717, as well as the judgments passed by this Court in the case of

Kankmal vs. Nighat Jahah and Others, reported in (2019) 3 MPLJ 292

and <a href="/doc/139769173/" id="a_5">West Central Railway, Jabalpur vs. Smt. Meera Bai @ Mamta Rani</a>

reported in 2013 (III) MPWN 102.
</p>
<p id="p_6">(10)   Order 6 Rule 17 of CPC reads as under:-
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                           4</span><p id="p_7">

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">             '' The Court may at any stage of the proceedings allow either
      party to alter or amend his pleadings in the such manner and on
      such terms as may be just, and all such amendments shall be made
      as may be necessary for the purpose of determining the real
      questions in controversy between the parties:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">             Provided that no application for amendment shall be allowed
      after the trial has commenced, unless the Court comes to the
      conclusion that in spite of due diligence, the party could not have
      raised the matter before the commencement of trial.''

(11) Thus, it is clear that no application for amendment shall be allowed after

the trial has commenced, unless the Court comes to the conclusion that in spite

of due diligence, the party could not have raised the matter before the

commencement of trial. Therefore, the words '' at any stage'' have to be read

with the proviso to Order 6 Rule 17 of CPC. There is no bar on filing an

application under Order 6 Rule 17 of CPC at the appellate stage, provided the

petitioner satisfies the Court that in spite of due diligence, he could not have

raised the matter before the commencement of trial.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_8">(12) The Supreme Court in the case of <a href="/doc/15115842/" id="a_6">M. Revanna vs. Ajanamma (Dead</a>)

by Legal Representatives and Others, reported in (2019) 4 SCC 332 has

held as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">         ''7. Leave to amend may be refused if it introduces a totally
         different, new and inconsistent case, or challenges the
         fundamental character of the suit. The proviso to Order VI Rule
         17 of the CPC virtually prevents an application for amendment
         of pleadings from being allowed after the trial has commenced,
         unless the Court comes to the conclusion that in spite of due
         diligence, the party could not have raised the matter before the
         commencement of the trial. The proviso, to an extent, curtails
         absolute discretion to allow amendment at any stage. Therefore,
         the burden is on the person who seeks an amendment after
         commencement of the trial to show that in spite of due
         diligence, such an amendment could not have been sought
         earlier. There cannot be any dispute that an amendment cannot
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                           5</span>

         be claimed as a matter of right, and under all circumstances.</blockquote><p id="p_9">
</p><p id="p_10">         Though normally amendments are allowed in the pleadings to
         avoid multiplicity of litigation, the Court needs to take into
         consideration whether the application for amendment is bona
         fide or mala fide and whether the amendment causes such
         prejudice to the other side which cannot be compensated
         adequately in terms of money. ''

(13)   In the present case, the petitioner in her application under Order 6 Rule

17 of CPC has nowhere mentioned as to why she could not obtain the

information spite of due diligence. The respondents had already taken a

specific stand in their written statement that as per the master plan of 1943, the

width of road is 50 ft. The written statement was filed on 22/06/2011. The

civil suit remained pending since March, 2013. Why the petitioner could not

obtain such an information under the Right to <a href="/doc/1965344/" id="a_7">Information Act</a> during the

pendency of the suit, has not been explained. Further, the information was

granted to the petitioner by letter dated 27/10/2014. Even then the petitioner

did not file any application for amendment and the application was filed only

on 04/01/2018 i.e. near about after three years from obtaining the information.

From the impugned order, it appears that the appeal has already reached to the

stage of final arguments.
</p>
<p id="p_11">(14) It is submitted by the Counsel for the petitioner that since the

amendment is based on the subsequent events, therefore, the same should be

allowed. The contention of the petitioner cannot be accepted for the simple

reason that the information was already with the Municipal Council, Dabra,

District Gwalior which was obtained by the petitioner only in the year 2014

under the Right to <a href="/doc/1965344/" id="a_8">Information Act</a>. Mere filing an application under the Right
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                                               6</span>

      to <a href="/doc/1965344/" id="a_9">Information Act</a>, cannot be said to be a subsequent event. The petitioner has

      not explained as to why no such application was filed during the pendency of

      trial and why the petitioner kept the document in her file until the appeal

      reached to the stage of final arguments.
</p>
<p id="p_12">      (15)   The last line of the impugned order reads as under:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_4">                 ^^vr% vihykFkhZ dh vksj ls izLrqr izkFkZuk i= vkaf'kd :i ls
                 Lohdkj djrs gq, izdj.k iqu% rdZ gsrq fu;r fd;k tkrk
                 gSA^^
      (16) From this observation, it appears that the appeal was already listed for

      final arguments and in spite of arguing the matter finally, the applications

      under Order 6 Rule 17 and under Order 41 Rule 27 of CPC were filed. Thus,

      this Court is of the considered opinion that in absence of any averment as to

      why the petitioner could not obtain information in spite of due diligence and

      in absence of any explanation as to why the petitioner did not file an

      application under Order 6 Rule 17 of CPC immediately after obtaining

      information on 27/10/2014, the appellate Court did not commit any mistake

      in rejecting the application filed under Order 6 Rule 17 of CPC.
