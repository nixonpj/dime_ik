THE COURT DELIVERED THE FOLLOWING:
                               :2:


                        JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">      This appeal was admitted to consider the following

substantial question of law:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">            "Whether the finding of the Court below
      that the Will in question is surrounded by
      suspicious circumstances for the reason that
      the   plaintiff   has    been   disinherited   is
      sustainable in the facts and circumstances of
      this case?"</blockquote><p id="p_2">

</p><p id="p_3">      2.    The brief facts leading to the appeal are as

follows:
</p>
<p id="p_4">      The deceased Beerappa Naik had a son by name

Govind Naik and a daughter by name Parvati (plaintiff).

His son Govind Naik predeceased him leaving behind

his widow and three daughters. The aforesaid Beerappa

Naik died on 14.10.1978. After his death, his daughter-

in-law Smt. Devi sought mutation of the suit schedule

properties in her name and in the name of her three

daughters on the strength of a Will dated 24.07.1973

purported to have been executed by late Beerappa Naik.

The said mutation was objected by the plaintiff namely
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                             :3:</span>


the daughter of the deceased and on coming to know of

the said Will, she filed a suit in O.S. No.76/1988

seeking partition of the properties belonging to late

Beerappa Naik described in schedule A and B to the

said suit. In the said suit, she specifically pleaded that

the Will put forward by the defendants namely the

daughter-in-law and the grandchildren of the deceased

Beerappa Naik was a false and concocted document;

deceased Beerappa Naik was not in a sound state of

mind to execute the alleged Will; the bequests made

therein are opposed to the provisions of the Karnataka

Land Reforms Act and on these contentions, she sought

half right in the suit schedule properties.


</p><p id="p_5">     3.    The defendants, on entering appearance,

resisted the suit and put forward the last Will and

testament dated 24.07.1973 executed by the deceased

and denied the claim of the plaintiff for partition and

separate possession of the suit schedule properties.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                             :4:</span>


</p><p id="p_6">     4.    Considering the contentions, the Trial Court

framed the following issues:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">     "1)   Whether plaintiff proves that the suit
           properties    are      the    self   acquired
           properties of her father Beerappa?
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">     2)    Whether the plaintiff         is entitled to
           partition and possession of ½ share in
           the   suit   properties      by   metes   and
           bounds?
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">     3)    Whether the defendants prove the Will
           dated 24.07.1973?
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">     4)    If so, whether it is legal and binding on
           plaintiff?
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">     5)    Whether the suit is not tenable for the
           reasons stated in para 6 and 7 of the
           written statement?
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_7">     6)    To what equities the parties are entitled
           to?
</blockquote>
     7)    What order or decree?"<p id="p_7">

</p><p id="p_8">     5.    The plaintiff examined herself as P.W.1 and

produced the record of rights of the suit schedule

properties, as per Ex.P-1 to Ex.P6 and Ex.P-8 and the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                            :5:</span>


house tax assessment extract - Ex.P-7 and the Form

No.6 - Ex.P-9. In order to prove the Will put forward by

the defendants, defendant No.1 examined herself as

D.W.1 and also examined one of the attestors to the Will

as D.W.2. The original registered Will was marked as

Ex.D-2. The order of Tahasildar and the mutation entry

came to be marked as Ex.D-3 and Ex.D-4 respectively.


</p><p id="p_9">       6.   Considering these evidence, the Trial Court

came to the conclusion that item Nos.2 to 6 of schedule

A properties are the      ancestral properties of late

Beerappa Naik and the house mentioned in schedule B

was his self acquired property and further holding that

the Will propounded by the defendants was shrouded

with    suspicious   circumstances,   decreed    the   suit

declaring that the plaintiff is entitled to half share in

item No.1 of schedule A properties and the house

mentioned in schedule B properties and further held

that the plaintiff is entitled to 1/4th share in item Nos.2

to 6 mentioned in suit A schedule properties. It further

declared that the defendants being the class I heirs of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                 :6:</span>


late Govind Naik are entitled to 3/4th share in item

Nos.2 to 6 mentioned in schedule A properties and they

are also entitled to half share in item No.1 of schedule A

properties and the house mentioned in schedule B

properties.
</p>
<p id="p_10">
</p><p id="p_11">     7.       In   view   of    rejection     of    the    Will,   the

defendants carried the matter in appeal before the Civil

Judge (Sr. Dn.), Kumta in Regular Appeal No.67/2006.

Upon issuance of the notice of appeal, the respondent,

namely the plaintiff entered appearance and filed a

cross appeal, insofar as negating her claim for half

share in respect of item Nos.2 to 6 of the A schedule

properties.    The   First     Appellate    Court        framed    the

following questions for its consideration:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_8">     "1.      Whether the finding of the Trial Court
              that the Item No.1 in the suit 'A'
              schedule    property      and        the    house
              mentioned in the 'B' schedule property
              are the self      acquired properties of
              Beerappa    Naik        and   the     remaining
              properties are the ancestral properties is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                       :7:</span>


     contrary to the facts and circumstances
     of the case and the evidence on record
     and against the principles of law and
     calls for interference by this Court?
</blockquote>
<p id="p_12">2.   Whether the finding of the Trial Court
     that the defendants have failed to prove
     that late Beerappa Naik has executed
     the Will dated 24.07.1973 is contrary to
     the facts and circumstances of the case
     and the evidence on record and against
     the principles of law and calls for
     interference by this Court?
</p>
<p id="p_13">3.   Whether the Judgment and Decree of
     the Trial Court that the plaintiff is
     entitled for ½ share in the Item No.1 of
     the plaint schedule house mentioned in
     'B' schedule and ¼th share in Item
     Nos.2 to 6 of the 'A' schedule property is
     contrary to the facts and circumstances
     of the case and the evidence on record
     and against the principles of law and
     calls for interference by this Court?
</p>
<p id="p_14">4.   Whether the person mentioned in I.A.
</p><p id="p_15">     No.III is either a necessary or proper
     party to this suit?
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                             :8:</span><p id="p_16">


</p><p id="p_17">     5.    What order?"
</p>
<p id="p_18">     8.    By the impugned judgment and decree dated

31.03.2010, the First Appellate Court confirmed the

finding of the Trial Court that item Nos.2 to 6 of suit A

schedule properties are the self acquired properties of

late Beerappa Naik and item No.1 of the plaint schedule

properties and the house described in B schedule

properties are also the self acquired properties of late

Beerappa Naik. Insofar as the proof of the Will is

concerned, the First Appellate Court on relying the

evidence   of   the   attesting   witness,   came   to   the

conclusion that the Will in question has been duly

proved. However, taking into consideration the non-

mention of the name of the plaintiff in the Will and in

the absence of any reason to disinherit her, the First

Appellate Court also came to the conclusion that the

Will propounded by the defendants is surrounded with

suspicious circumstances and consequently the appeal

filed by the defendants as well as the cross appeal filed
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                  :9:</span>


by the respondent - plaintiff were dismissed confirming

the judgment of the Trial Court.
</p>
<p id="p_19">
</p><p id="p_20">        9.        Feeling   aggrieved     by       the   impugned

judgment, the defendants are in appeal before this

Court.
</p>
<p id="p_21">
</p><p id="p_22">        10.       I have heard the learned counsel Sri.S.V.Yaji

appearing for the appellants and the learned counsel

Sri.J.S.Shetty appearing for the respondent and have

carefully examined the records.
</p>
<p id="p_23">

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                             : 10 :</span><p id="p_25">


</p><p id="p_26">     (i)     The Trial Court as well as the First Appellate

Court have fallen in error in disbelieving the Will

executed by late Beerappa Naik on the ground that it is

surrounded with suspicious circumstances solely on

account of disinheriting the plaintiff from her legitimate

share in the suit schedule properties. The learned

counsel has emphasized that the evidence of the

attesting witness has not been discredited and no

circumstances are brought out in the cross-examination

of this witness to suggest that the deceased was not in a

sound state of mind or that the said Will was executed

under any suspicious circumstances. The recitals of the

Will clearly indicate that after the death of his son, the

deceased     Beerappa    Naik     was       residing   with    the

defendants    who    were   not      only    looking   after   the

deceased, but were also assisting him in the cultivation.

The defendants had no other source of support for their

livelihood other than the suit schedule properties.

Whereas, the plaintiff being his daughter was given in

marriage about 30 years earlier and she was well settled
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                             : 11 :</span>


in life. The deceased Beerappa Naik had granted portion

of his tenancy right to the husband of the plaintiff in

respect of which the occupancy right was granted in the

name of the husband of the plaintiff. As such, there was

justifiable reason for the deceased to disinherit the

plaintiff. Under the said circumstance, merely because

her name did not find place in the Will could not have

been taken as a circumstance to doubt or disbelieve the

Will. Therefore, the approach of both the Courts in

appreciating the evidence of D.W.1 as well as construing

the recitals of the Will has led to grave miscarriage of

justice.
</p>
<p id="p_27">
</p><p id="p_28">      (ii)   By referring to the principles laid down in

the   above    decisions,   the      learned   counsel   has

emphasized that the very purpose of executing the Will

is to alter the mode of succession. The defendants are

the class I heirs of the deceased. The bequest in favour

of the class I heirs cannot be said to be unnatural. The

said bequest does not offend either Section 21 or

Section 61 of the       Karnataka Land Reforms Act.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                            : 12 :</span>


Therefore, viewed from any angle, the findings of the

Court below on this issue is patently erroneous and

perverse and calls for interference by this Court.


</p><p id="p_29">     12.   Defending    the    impugned   judgment,   the

learned counsel for the respondent has emphatically

submitted that both the Courts below having recorded a

finding of fact based on the oral and documentary

evidence produced by the parties, the appellants are not

entitled to challenge the said finding on the purported

plea that the approach of the Courts below has resulted

in miscarriage of justice. The learned counsel would

point out that both the Courts below have taken into

consideration the fact that the deceased was aged more

than 80 years. None of the attesting witnesses were

known to the deceased or acquainted with him. The very

fact that the Will in question has been attested by a

stranger itself throws doubt on the genuineness of the

Will. Further the recital in the Will proceeds as if the

deceased had only one son and no other legal heirs,

which is a strong circumstance indicating that the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                            : 13 :</span>


instructions to draft the said Will did not flow from the

testator and the defendants themselves have brought

about the said Will.
</p>
<p id="p_30">
</p><p id="p_31">       13.   The learned counsel would further submit,

that Will is rendered doubtful not only for the reason of

disinheriting the plaintiff, but also for the reason that

surrounding circumstances under which the said Will

came    into   existence   also     throw   doubt   on   the

genuineness of the Will. Both the Courts below have

appreciated all these facts and circumstances and have

come to a right conclusion in disbelieving the Will and

therefore, there is no reason for this Court to interfere

with the concurrent findings recorded by the Court.

Thus he seeks for the dismissal of the appeal.


</p><p id="p_32">       14.   I have bestowed my careful thought to the

submissions made by the learned counsel for the

parties and have carefully examined the pleadings and

documents with reference to the Will - Ex.D-2 and the

evidence of attesting witness - D.W.2.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                            : 14 :</span>


</p><p id="p_33">     15.    Insofar as the nature of the right of the

deceased over the suit schedule properties is concerned,

both the learned counsel for the parties do not dispute

the finding recorded by the Court below that the suit

schedule properties are the tenanted properties of late

Beerappa Naik in respect of which occupancy right was

granted to him by the Land Tribunal. Therefore, I do not

propose to enter into this issue. The only question that

requires to be considered in this second appeal is:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_9">            "Whether the Will in question is liable to
     be    discarded   solely   for   the   reason   of
     disinheriting the plaintiff?"</blockquote><p id="p_34">

</p><p id="p_35">     16.    In order to prove the execution of the Will,

the defendants have examined one of the attesting

witnesses as D.W.2. I have carefully gone through his

evidence. His evidence reveals that about 20 or 22 years

prior to his examination before the Court, the deceased

Beerappa Naik had come to the Court. He was standing

near Narasimha Gouda. At that time, D.W.2 was

working as an Advocate's clerk. By the side of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                           : 15 :</span>


aforesaid Narasimha Gouda, one Pandit was standing.

The deceased called him and he instructed Narasimha

Gouda to draft a Will. Accordingly, Narasimha Gouda

prepared the draft. He read over the draft to the

deceased. Thereafter, a fair Will was prepared. It was

read over to the deceased by Narasimha Gouda. The

deceased affixed his LTM to the said Will in the presence

of D.W.1 as well as in the presence of the Document

Writer and another witness; whereafter, D.W.2 and the

other witness subscribed their signatures and thereafter

the deceased and Narasimha Gouda proceeded to the

Registration Office. D.W.1 further stated that at the time

of execution of the said Will, the deceased was in sound

state of mind.
</p>
<p id="p_36">
</p><p id="p_37">     17.   In the cross-examination, it is elicited that at

the time of execution of the Will, the deceased was aged

about 75-76 years. DW1 further asserted that in their

presence the deceased told them that he has already

given some of his properties to his daughter and since

his son is dead, he intends to give other properties to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">                             : 16 :</span>


his daughter-in-law and their children. According to

him, it took about half an hour to prepare the draft and

¾ hour to prepare the fair Will.        He denied the

suggestion that the Will is not executed in their

presence by the deceased.

<p id="p_38">
</p><p id="p_39">     18.   Though the evidence of DW1 at the first

blush appears to be in conformity with the requirements

of <a href="/doc/1673132/" id="a_2">Section 63</a> of the Indian Succession Act as well as

<a href="/doc/63662/" id="a_3">Section 68</a> of the Indian Evidence Act, but what emerges

from the evidence of this witness is that, this witness

was an utter stranger to the deceased. He was not

acquainted with the deceased in any manner. It is not

the case of the defendants, nor is it forthcoming in the

evidence of DW1 that the deceased had any litigation in

the Court so that he could come to the Court in search

of the witnesses. Further his evidence indicates that

Narasimha Gouda, who drafted the document is not an

advocate rather a document writer. It is not known as

to why the deceased would come to the Court, if in fact

he wanted the Will to be written by a document writer.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                           : 17 :</span>


Normally, the document writers would be available near

the Registration Office or in their regular offices. It is

not forthcoming in the evidence of DW1 or DW2 as to

how the said document writer was allowed to draft the

document in the Court premises.
</p>
<p id="p_40">
</p><p id="p_41">     19.   Be that as it may. The evidence of D.W.2

does not disclose any special reason for the deceased to

request DW2 to attest the Will, when it is admitted by

D.W.2 that he was not acquainted with the deceased.

Even with regard to the instructions given by the

deceased, according to this witness in their presence the

deceased told them that he has already given some

properties to his daughter and therefore, he wanted to

bequeath the other properties to his daughter.       This

recital is conspicuously absent in the Will. As rightly

contended by the learned counsel for the respondent,

there is not even a remote reference to his daughter in

the entire Will. On the other hand, the Will is drafted as

if the deceased had only one son and no other legal
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">                           : 18 :</span>


heirs. This is one of the strong circumstance leading to

doubt the genuineness of the Will.
</p>
<p id="p_42">
</p><p id="p_43">     20.   Further, DW2 has stated in his evidence

that, after executing the Will, the deceased and the

document writer proceeded to the Registration Office. A

perusal of the Will at Ex.D2 indicates that the Will was

presented for registration on the subsequent day. There

is absolutely no evidence to show that, on the next day

the deceased had gone to the Registration Office. The

document writer namely, the aforesaid Narasimha

Gouda is not examined before the Court. No one has

identified the testator before the Sub Registrar. Even the

LTM said to have been affixed by the deceased in the

Registration Office is not identified by anyone, not even

by the document writer. The endorsement made by the

Sub-Registrar indicate that the document writer was

known to the Sub-Registrar. But the document writer

has not identified the      deceased before    the   Sub-

Registrar. As per the recitals in the Will, the deceased

was aged 80 years as on the date shown in the Will.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">                                  : 19 :</span>


Though there is nothing on record to suggest that the

deceased was not in a position to move about or that he

was suffering from any physical or mental ailment, but

the manner in which the document has come into

existence,      creates    a    serious     suspicion   about   its

genuineness.
</p>
<p id="p_44">
</p><p id="p_45">      21.    Even the bequest made in the Will leads to

suspicion. Though DW2 has stated that the deceased

had instructed the document writer that he had already

granted some of his properties to his daughter and

therefore, he intended to disinherit her, there is no

material whatsoever to show that the testator had either

granted any portion of his land to his daughter during

his life time, nor is there any recital in the Will to that

effect.   The     Courts       below      have   considered   these

circumstances as suspicious circumstances. Though

normally the Will would not be disbelieved merely

because the legal heirs are disinherited, but in the

instant case, having regard to the over all facts and

circumstances discussed above, I am also of the view
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">                              : 20 :</span>


that    the    above   circumstances      render   the     Will

suspicious.     Therefore,   I   concur   with   the    finding

recorded by the Courts below on this issue and

accordingly answer the substantial question of law

against the appellants.

<p id="p_46">

be stated that, during the pendency of this appeal, the

impugned decree is put into execution in the final

decree proceedings and the learned counsel for the

appellants has produced the certified copy of the final

order passed in FDP No.77/2013 dated 19.06.2015, the

operative portion of which reads as under:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_10">              "Petition filed under Order 20 rule 18 of
       CPC is hereby allowed. Final decree is passed
       in terms of the commissioner's report and the
       memo filed by the petitioner. The sketch
       produced along with the commissioner report
       so far as the petition A schedule properties are
       concerned, it forms part of the final decree."</blockquote><p id="p_48">

</p><p id="p_49">       23.    The learned counsel has also made available

the delivery receipts for having taken possession of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">                            : 21 :</span>


shares allotted to the plaintiff.     Insofar as house

property is concerned, the plaintiff has also submitted a

memo before the trial Court giving up her right.


</p><p id="p_50">     In view of the above and the substantial question

of law having been answered against the appellants, the

appeal is liable to be dismissed.
