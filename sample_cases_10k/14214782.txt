<p id="p_9">    Industrial Tribunal-cum-Labour Court, Shimla, has dismissed the

</p>



<p id="p_11">                                                                  .
</p><p id="p_12">    workman was engaged on daily waged basis as a Beldar in the





    year 1990-91. He continuously worked for more than 240 days in





    each year.     It was 30th March, 1996 when he was allegedly

    retrenched. The respondent-workman, after 14 years, raised a

    Demand Charter, to give rise to conciliation of proceedings under




    the <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_1">Industrial Disputes Act</a>. However, the Labour Commissioner,

    vide order dated 30th June, 2011, eventually declined to refer the


    matter to Industrial Tribunal-cum-Labour Court, as according to

    him, there was no justification to raise the dispute after a period of


    more than 14 years. The Reference was thus declined.
</p>
<p id="p_13">    4.           The respondent-workman approached this Court by




    way of CWP No.238 of 2012 and the same was allowed by learned





    Single Judge vide order dated 13th May, 2015, the operative part





    whereof reads as follow:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">                 "4. Accordingly, the writ petition is allowed.
                 Annexure      P-2 dated 30.6.2011 is quashed and set
                 aside. The Labour Commissioner, Himachal Pradesh is
                 directed to make reference to the Labour Court-cum-
                 Industrial Tribunal, within four weeks from today.
                 Thereafter, the Labour Court-cum-Industrial Tribunal
                 shall decide the reference within a period of six
                 months. The question of limitation can be considered
                 by the Labour Court-cum-Industrial Tribunal, while

                moulding the relief. Pending application(s), if any, shall
                stand disposed of."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_14">    5.          It may thus be seen that the matter was ordered to be

    referred to Labour Court-cum-Industrial Tribunal and the question




                                                                 .
</p>
<p id="p_15">    of limitation of appeal was directed to be kept in view "while

    moulding the relief".
</p>




<p id="p_16">    6.          The appellants-State unfortunately did not challenge

    the order of learned Single Judge, cited above, and having





    accepted the same the matter was referred to the Industrial

    Tribunal-cum-Labour Court, who vide award dated 22.03.2016,

    ordered the reinstatement of the respondent with seniority from

    the date the Demand Notice was served. No back wages were

    granted to the respondent. It may be noticed that while granting



    relief, the Tribunal has found as a matter of fact that some juniors




    to the respondent were allegedly retained in the employment and





    this Principle of Last Come First Go was violated. The plea of

    abandonment of employment by the respondent-workman, as





    raised on behalf of the Department/Employer, was also not

    accepted being unsubstantiated.
</p>
<p id="p_17">    7.          The above stated award was challenged by the

    appellants-State before learned Single Judge, who vide order

    under appeal, has held and rightly so that the State Authorities

    had accepted the earlier judgment dated 13.05.2015, rendered in




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                              ::: Downloaded on - 04/04/2019 21:58:52 :::HCHP</span>

    respondent-workman's Civil Writ Petition No.238 of 2012, they

    cannot be permitted time and again to raise the plea of inordinate

    delay in raising the dispute. As has been noticed earlier, this Court




                                                                 .
</p><p id="p_18">    intended to strike balance between the right of the respondent-
</p>




<p id="p_19">    workman to challenge the wrongful retrenchment on one hand





    and right of the State to defeat such claim on the ground of delay

    on the other hand. It was for this reason the Labour Court was

    questioned to keep the delay in view while moulding the relief.
</p>



<p id="p_20">    The Industrial Tribunal-cum-Labour Court, in deference to those

    observations, denied the reinstatement or seniority to the


    respondent-workman from the date of alleged retrenchment and

    restricted those benefits from the date when the Demand Notice


    was served. Similarly, no unjust enrichment has been allowed by

    denying the back wages to the workman.
</p>



<p id="p_21">    8.          True it is that unexplained and inordinate delay in





    raising the Industrial Dispute can be effectively fatal to the claim





    itself but this issue stands already settled between the parties in

    the earlier round of litigation. Any contrary view, if taken in these

    proceedings, would amount to nullifying the mandate of the

    Judgment dated 13th May, 2015, passed in CWP No.238 of 2012,

    which has attained finality.
