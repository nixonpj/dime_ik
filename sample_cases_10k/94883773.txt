<p id="p_1">3   21-03-2018            Heard learned counsel for the petitioner and learned

                  APP for the State.
</p>
<p id="p_2">                         This is the second round of litigation. Earlier the

                  prayer for bail of the petitioner was rejected vide order

                  dated 08.08.2017, passed in Cr. Misc. No. 29924 of 2017.

</p><p id="p_3">                         Petitioner is languishing in judicial custody since

                  04.01.2016 in connection with S.T. No. 129 of 2016, arising

                  out of Balrampur P.S. Case No. 140 of 2015 for offences

                  punishable under Sections 302 and other allied<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_1"> Sections of

                  the Indian Penal Code</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_4">                         The prosecution case, as lodged by the informant, is

                  that petitioner along with one Raju Das came to his house in

                  the evening and after having food they slept with his father

                  on the verandah. In the night he heard the screaming sound

         of his step-mother. He found her drenched in blood and his

         father also brutally injured. Petitioner and other co-accused

         also assaulted the informant giving knife blow but he

         managed to escape. Thereafter his father and step-mother

         both succumbed to the injuries.
</p>
<p id="p_5">                It has been submitted by the learned counsel for the

         petitioner that he is innocent and has been falsely

         implicated in the aforesaid case. He submits that the

         petitioner is languishing in judicial custody for more than

         two years and is ready to cooperate in the trial on day-to-

         day basis.
</p>
<p id="p_6">                However, learned APP for the State opposes the prayer

         for bail stating therein that the informant is an eye-witness

         and both the father and step-mother of the informant has

         died due to the said injuries.
</p>
<p id="p_7">                Considering the nature of allegations, I am not inclined

         to grant privilege of bail to the petitioner at this stage in

         connection with S.T. No. 129/16, arising out of Balrampur

         P.S. Case No. 140/15, pending in the court of learned

         A.D.J.-V, Katihar.
</p>
<p id="p_8">                Application is, accordingly, rejected. However, the

         learned court below is directed to expedite the trial and

                    conclude the same within a period of six months. Petitioner

                    is at liberty to renew his prayer for bail after six months if

                    trial is not concluded by that time.
