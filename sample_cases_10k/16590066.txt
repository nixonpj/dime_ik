             Mr.   Koushik Sain
             Mr.   Prasenjit Pal

             Mr. Uday Sankar Bhattacharya
             Mr. Bhaskar Prasad Banerjee            - for Respondents




                     The petitioners assail two attachment notices issued by the Central Excise

             authorities.
</p>
<p id="p_2">                     The learned Senior Advocate for the petitioners submits that, the first petitioner

             had purchased the assets of a company incorporated under the provisions of the

             <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_1">Companies Act</a>, 1956 pursuant to a sale notice issued by a Bank acting under the

             provisions of Securitization and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and <a href="/doc/198257891/" id="a_2">Enforcement of

             Security Interest Act</a>, 2002. He submits that, the business of such company was not put

             up for sale. Only the assets were put up for sale. The first petitioner had purchased

             such assets from the Bank. He refers to the sale notice issued by the Bank. He refers to

             the various clauses of the sale notice, which stipulate that the sale was on as is where is

             and whatever there is basis. He submits that, there is no whisper in the sale notice that

             the business of the company was being sold. The first petitioner purchased the assets

             only without the business of such company. The liability on account of central excise

             cannot be foisted upon the petitioners.     He relies upon 2013 (295) E.L.T. 12 (S.C.)

             (<a href="/doc/123741567/" id="a_3">Rana Girders Ltd. -vs- Union of India</a>) in support of the contention that, there is a
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                                2</span>

distinction between a purchase of assets and a purchase of the business. He submits

that, the Hon'ble Supreme Court noticing such distinction did not fasten the liability on

a purchaser of assets. He further submits that a review petition directed against Rana

Girders Ltd. (supra) was rejected by the Hon'ble Supreme Court, reported in 2015 (320)

E.L.T. A175 (S.C.) (<a href="/doc/1818287/" id="a_4">Union of India -vs- Rana Girders Ltd</a>.). He refers to 2016 (332)

E.L.T. 601 (Guj.) (<a href="/doc/117701371/" id="a_5">Shreejikrupa Spinners Pvt. Ltd. -vs- Union of India</a>)        and 2009

(234) E.L.T. 596 (Bom.) (<a href="/doc/109429725/" id="a_6">Tata Metaliks Limited -vs- Union of India</a>) and submits

that, in terms of <a href="/doc/15859491/" id="a_7">section 11</a> of the Central Excise Act, 1944, recovery of sums from

transferee of assets is permissible only when such transferee takes over the entire

running business. In the present case, the first petitioner not having done so, the first

petitioner is not liable. With regard to distinction between ownership of business and

ownership of assts, he relies upon (2006) 1 SCC 615 (<a href="/doc/330146/" id="a_8">State of Karnataka &amp; Anr. -vs-

Shreyas Papers (P) Ltd. &amp; Ors</a>.). He submits that, in view of <a href="/doc/1080390/" id="a_9">section 11</a> of the Act of

1944 not empowering the Central Excise authorities to foist any liability of the defaulter

to the purchaser of its assets, the order of attachment and all consequent orders of

attachment made therein should be quashed.
</p>
<p id="p_3">       The learned advocate appearing for the Department submits that the Bank was

well aware of the dues of its borrower towards central excise. The Bank was informed

from time to time by the authorities about such dues. The Bank ought not to have put

up the property for sale without informing the Central Excise authorities.       The first

petitioner having purchased the property with the knowledge of default of the central

excise, the first petitioner is liable to pay the same.
</p>
<p id="p_4">       I have considered the rival contentions of the parties and the materials made

available on record.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                              3</span><p id="p_5">

</p><p id="p_6">       Central Excise authorities had various claims against one of its assessees. Such

assessee is a borrower of a Bank. The Bank had proceeded under the provisions of the

Act of 2002 against its security interest.    It had put up the assets belonging to the

defaulter/borrower for sale. The first petitioner had participated in such sale. The sale

was on as is where is and whatever there is basis as appearing in the sale notice. The

first petitioner being successful in the auction sale had purchased such properties from

the Bank.
</p>
<p id="p_7">       Upon such purchase being completed, Central Excise authorities had proceeded

against the first petitioner for default of the assessee/borrower. No doubt, the Central

Excise authorities had informed the Bank as to the liability of its borrower on account of

central excise duty. It can also be contended with some justification that, the petitioners

were aware of such defaults by the borrower. The question is whether such knowledge

empowers the Central Excise authorities to fasten the liability of the assessee on the

purchaser in absence of the purchaser not purchasing the business of the assessee or

not.
</p>
<p id="p_8">       In the facts of the present case, as the sale notice itself demonstrate that, the sale

was on as is what is and whatever there is basis, the business of the assessee was not

put up for sale.    The first petitioner did not purchase the business of the borrower.

Therefore, whether as purchaser of the assets of the assessee can the first petitioner be

said to be a person liable to pay the amount defaulted by the assessee?

</p><p id="p_9">       Such issue was considered in Rana Girders Ltd. (supra). It is of the view that,

only when the purchaser purchases the entire business it is liable for central excise due.

It is of the following view:
</p>
<p id="p_10">       "21.   A harmonious reading of the judgments in Macson and SICOM would
tend us to conclude that it is only in those cases where the buyer had purchased
the entire unit i.e. the entire business itself, that he would be responsible to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                                4</span>

discharge the liability of Central Excise as well. Otherwise, the subsequent
purchaser cannot be fastened with the liability relating to the dues of the
Government unless there is a specific provision in the Statute, claiming "first
charge for the purchaser". As far as <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_10">Central Excise Act</a> is concerned, there was no
such specific provision as noticed in SICOM as well. Proviso to <a href="/doc/15859491/" id="a_11">Section 11</a> is now
added by way of amendment in the Act only w.e.f. 10-9-2004. Therefore, we are
eschewing our discussion regarding this proviso as that is not applicable insofar as
present case is concerned. Accordingly, we thus, hold that insofar as legal position
is concerned, UPFC being a secured creditor had priority over the excise dues. We
further hold that since the appellant had not purchased the entire unit as a
business, as per the statutory framework he was not liable for discharging the dues
of the Excise Department.
</p><p id="p_11">       22.     With this, we now revert to the first issue, namely interpretation of
the clause in the Sale Deed for land and building and similar clause in Agreement
of Sale for machinery on the basis of which appellant is held to be liable to pay the
dues. These clauses have already been incorporated in the earlier portion of our
judgment.
</p><p id="p_12">       23.     We may notice that in the first instance it was mentioned not only in
the   public   notice   but   there   is   a   specific   clause   inserted   in   the   Sale
Deed/Agreement as well, to the effect that the properties in question are being
sold free from all encumbrances. At the same time, there is also a stipulation that
"all these statutory liabilities arising out of the land shall be borne by purchaser in
the sale deed" and "All these statutory liabilities arising out of the said properties
shall be borne by the vendee and vendor shall not be held responsible in the
Agreement of Sale".      As per the High Court, these statutory liabilities would
include excise dues. We find that the High Court has missed the true intent and
purport of this clause.       The expressions in the Sale Deed as well as in the
Agreement for purchase of plant and machinery talks of statutory liabilities
"arising out of the land" or statutory liabilities "arising out of the said properties"
(i.e. machinery). Thus, it is only that statutory liabilities which arises out of the
land and building or out of plant and machinery which is to be discharged by the
purchaser. Excise dues are not the statutory liabilities which arise out of the said
land and building or the plant and machinery. Statutory liabilities arising out of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                             5</span>

the land and building could be in the form of the property tax or other types of
cess relating ton property etc. Likewise, statutory liability arising out of the plant
and machinery could be the sales tax etc. payable on the said machinery. As far as
dues of the Central Excise are concerned, they were not related to the said plant
and machinery or the land and building and thus did not arise out of those
properties. Dues of the Excise Department became payable on the manufacturing
of excisable items by the erstwhile owner, therefore, these statutory dues are in
respect of those items produced and not the plant and machinery which was used
for the purposes of manufacture. This fine distinction is not taken note at all by
the High Court."
</p>
<p id="p_13">      Tata Metaliks Limited (supra) and Shreejikrupa Spinners Pvt. Ltd. (supra) are

also of similar view. In Tata Metaliks Limited (supra) it is held that, the provisions of

the Act of 2002 will prevail over the provisions of the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_12">Central Excise Act</a>, 1944. It has

also held that a purchaser of an asset in an auction held under the Act of 2002 will hold

such assets free from encumbrances.
</p>
<p id="p_14">      There is a distinction between business, ownership of business and the assets of

the business. It is explained in Shreejikrupa Spinners Pvt. Ltd. (supra). It explains

such concepts as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_15">      "15.   In this regard a perusal of the auction notice issued by the ARCIL
reveals that the assets were sold in three lots. The first lot comprised of land and
building and the second lot was comprised of plant and machinery and structures
of the defaulter unit and the third lot was a composite lot comprised of lot 1 and
lot 2. It is, therefore, clear that it was the assets of the defaulter company that
had been sold to the petitioner and that the erstwhile unit has not been sold as a
going concern."
</p>
<p id="p_16">      Section 11 (E) of the Central Excise Act, 1944 is as follows:

      "SECTION 11E.         Liability under Act to be first charge. - Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in any <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_13">Central Act</a> or <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_14">State Act</a>, any amount of
duty, penalty, interest, or any other sum payable by an assessee or any other
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                                6</span>

person under this Act or the rules made thereunder shall, save as otherwise
provided in <a href="/doc/1190954/" id="a_15">section 529A</a> of the Companies Act, 1956 (1 of 1956), the Recovery of
Debts Due to Banks and the Financial Institutions Act, 1993 (51 of 1993) and the
Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and the <a href="/doc/198257891/" id="a_16">Enforcement of
Security Interest Act</a>, 2002 (54 of 2002), be the first charge on the property of the
assessee or the person, as the case may be."
</p>
<p id="p_17">         In my view, <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_17">section 11E</a> of the Act of 1944 will apply and will create a first charge

on the property of the assessee or the purchaser of such property as the case may be in

the event, the same is not contrary to the provisions of the Act of 2002.    In the present

case, the Bank claims first charge over the properties put up for sale.        Moreover, as

noted about, the entire business was not put up for sale. Only the assets of the assessee

were put up for sale.
</p>
<p id="p_18">         In such circumstances, Central Excise authorities have acted without jurisdiction

in proceeding against the petitioners in respect of the defaults committed by the

assessee. All proceedings including the orders of attachment initiated by the Central

Excise authorities on the basis of default of its assessee against the petitioners are set

aside.
</p>
<p id="p_19">         W. P. No. 13790 (W) of 2017 is disposed of without any order as to costs.

         Urgent certified website copies of this order, if applied for, be made available to

the parties upon compliance of the requisite formalities.
