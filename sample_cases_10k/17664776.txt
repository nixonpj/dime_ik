<p id="p_1">                            Re: C. A. N. 3485 of 2018 (Stay).
</p>

<p id="p_2">                         This is an application for stay of operation of the
                 judgment and decree dated December 22, 2017 passed
                 by the learned Civil Judge (Senior Division), 1st Court,
                 Alipore in Money Suit No. 89 of 2011.
</p><p id="p_3">                         Heard Mr. Sengupta, the learned advocate for
                 the petitioner and Mr. Mukherjee, the learned advocate
                 for the opposite party. Mr. Mukherjee wants to expedite
                 the hearing of the appeal itself.
</p><p id="p_4">                         In such view of it, we do not propose to keep
                 this application pending.
</p><p id="p_5">                         The learned Trial Judge passed a decree in
                 favour of the plaintiff/opposite party for realisation of
                 Rs. 11,91,539/- (rupees eleven lakhs ninety one
                 thousand five hundred thirty nine) from the defendant
                 with simple interest @ 6% per annum from May 18,
                 2012 till the date of actual payment. The applicant
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                           2</span>


herein was further directed to pay the decretal amount
by certain instalment, the first of which was to be paid
by February 15, 2018. In default, the applicant was
required to pay the simple interest @ 10% per annum
from the date of the order till the date of actual
payment. The defendant's counter-claim was dismissed
on contest.
</p><p id="p_6">          Mr. Mukherjee has drawn my attention that the
defendant has not paid any payment pursuant to the
direction of the Court, which Mr. Sengupta admits. Not
only did the applicant make the payment in terms of
the direction of the Court's order he also filed the
present application about four months after he had
received the certified copy. The appeal itself filed beyond
the period by which the first instalment was required to
be paid.
</p><p id="p_7">          After   considering   the   rival   cases   and   the
judgment and decree impugned in the appeal we direct
that there shall be an unconditional stay of operation of
the impugned judgment and decree for a period of three
weeks. In case the applicant deposits Rs. 15 lakhs
(rupees    fifteen   lakhs)   with    the   learned   Registrar
General, High Court, Calcutta during the said period of
three weeks the stay of operation of the judgment and
decree shall continue till the disposal of the appeal. In
default, the respondent shall be entitled to act in
accordance with law.
</p><p id="p_8">          In case such amount is deposited with the
learned Registrar General within the said period he
shall invest it in a short term fixed deposit scheme with
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                         3</span>


any nationalised bank and shall go on renewing the
same from time to time until further order.
</p><p id="p_9">        With the directions as above, the application for
stay being C. A. N. 3485 of 2018 is disposed of.
</p>

books out of Court.
