</p>
<p id="p_2">ORAL JUDGMENT :- (Per B.R. Gavai, J.)



                     Rule. Rule made returnable forthwith. Heard finally

by consent of the learned Counsel for the parties.



02]                  The applicants have approached this Court with a

prayer for quashing and setting aside the F.I.R. and charge-sheet

arising out of the complaint lodged by non-applicant No.2

against them vide Crime No.103/2016 with Police Station

Sakkardara, Nagpur for the offences punishable under Sections

498-A read with <a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_1">Section 34</a> of the Indian Penal Code and under

<a href="/doc/751411/" id="a_2">Sections 3</a> and <a href="/doc/1023340/" id="a_3">4</a> of the Dowry Prohibition Act.



03]                  Applicant no.1 and non-applicant No.2 are husband

and wife and they are blessed with two daughters. It appears

that there arose some matrimonial disputes between applicant

no.1 and non-applicant no.2 and as such the aforesaid F.I.R.


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1"> ::: Uploaded on - 06/03/2017                    ::: Downloaded on - 08/03/2017 00:41:51 :::</span>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2"> apl.899.16.jud.doc                         3</span>

came to be lodged making allegation that applicant no.1 and

rest of the applicants, who are related to applicant no.1, are

harassing her for not meeting the demand of dowry.



04]                  From the perusal of the affidavit filed on behalf of non-

applicant no.2, it could be seen that the matter has been

amicably settled between the applicants and non-applicant no.2

and non-applicant no.2 does not wish to prosecute the present

proceedings.
</p>
<p id="p_3">

05]                  Applicant no.1 and non-applicant No.2 are personally

present in the Court. They are identified by the learned Counsel

for the applicants.             They reiterate that the matter has been

amicably settled between them taking into consideration the

welfare of their daughters. The non-applicant No.2 states that

she is not interested in continuing the criminal prosecution

against the applicants.             It is also informed that they are now

residing together and leading the peaceful life.



06]                  The Apex Court in the case of <a href="/doc/469138/" id="a_4">B.S. Joshi and others

vs. State of Haryana and another</a> reported in (2003) 4 SCC



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3"> ::: Uploaded on - 06/03/2017                      ::: Downloaded on - 08/03/2017 00:41:51 :::</span>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4"> apl.899.16.jud.doc                        4</span>

675 has held that if the matrimonial dispute has been settled

between the parties, this Court can exercise powers under

<a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_5">Section 482</a> of the Criminal Procedure Code to quash and give an

end to the criminal proceedings.
</p>
<p id="p_4">

07]                  In that view of the matter, we find that the present

case is a fit case where this Court should exercise powers under

<a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_6">Section 482</a> of the Criminal Procedure Code and give an end to

the criminal proceedings. Hence, the application is allowed. Rule

is made absolute in terms of prayer clause (i).
