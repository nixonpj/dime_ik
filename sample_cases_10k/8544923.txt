officials namely Abhishek Kumar, AM; Kuldeep GET; Shyam Narain, 

GET   and   J   Solanki   of   the   complainant   company   inspected   the 

premises No. 220­J­33, Vishnu Garden, Tagore Garden, New Delhi. . 

One electricity meter No 027669 with K No. 6410B070042 (with old 

K No. PB8111232217)  was installed in the premises in the name of 

M/s   S.S   Industries   with   the   sanctioned   load   of   10.09   KW/IX. 

Accused No 2 is user of the premises. The meter was checked and 

found that both the seals are tampered. The left hand side rivet was 

found cut and right hand side rivet was found relaxed. A continuous 

cavity was found on both  sides i.e right and left of the meter through 

which   the   internal   mechanism   of   the   meter   can   be   controlled   and 

consumption   units   can   be   altered.    The  accused   were  indulging  in 

dishonest   abstraction   of   energy.     The   photographs   were   taken   and 

videography was also done at the spot. A connected load of 71.594 

KW/IX was found at the spot.   Inspection report, meter details and 

load report were prepared and offered to the accused who refused to 

receive and sign the same. Inspection report was pasted on the meter 

by restoring the supply through same tampered meter.   A theft bill 

was raised against the accused which remained unpaid. Hence, this 

complaint.

<p id="p_4">4.           PW1   Pankaj   Tandon   stated   that   he   is   authorized   by   the 

complainant company to sign, file and proceed with the complaint Ex. 

CW1/A on  the basis  of authority Ex. CW1/B given to him by the 

complainant.

<p id="p_5">5.           PW­2 Abhishek Kumar stated that on 28.3.2006 at 1 pm he 

along   with   other   officials   of   the   complainant   company   along   with 

photographer inspected  the premises NO 220­J­33, Vishnu Garden, 

Tagore Garden, New Delhi. They found irregularities like RHS half 

seal of the meter refixed, LHS half seal tampered, a continuous cavity 

from LHS to RHS in the meter through which internal mechanism can 

be   controlled   and   recorded   consumption   can   be   altered.   The 

photographs   Ex   PW2/2   (Objected   to)   were   taken   at   the   spot   and 

videography Ex PW2/1(Objected to) was done in the presence of

consumer.     Inspection   report,   load   report   and   meter   report   Ex 

PW2/3­5 were prepared at the spot. Accused Pradeep met them at the 

spot and documents were offered to him who refused to receive and 

sign the same. The documents were pasted at the site.  The meter was 

found tampered with a load of 71.5 KW/IX. The load comprised of 

one   injection   moulding   machine,   compressor,   motor   pump   and 

lightening rods. In the cross­examination he admitted that electricity 

in the premises was used through meter at the time of inspection. The 

meter was recording correct consumption.   It is admitted that there 

was no theft of electricity  in the premises at the time of inspection. It 

is admitted that no artificial means of abstraction were found installed 

at the time of inspection.  It is admitted that seals were installed on the 

meter. It is admitted that details of tampering have not been recorded 

in the inspection report.   He does not know that exact material used 

for refix  the seal.  It is admitted that no external material was found 

to   hinder   the   operation   of   meter.   The   meter   in   question   was   not 

seized.  The suggestion is denied that meter was not seized because it 

was   not   tampered.   The   suggestion   is   denied   that     factory   was   not 

running at the time of inspection or machines were lying idle. The 

load was taken with the help of clip on meter but he has not recorded 

the details of the clip on  meter in the record prepared by him.  The 

                                                              CC No. 105/11/06
                                                                   23.09.2011

current reflected on clip on meter in the photographs is 11.1 AMP and 

load comes to 4.2 KW.   The suggestion is denied that only 4.2 KW 

load was found connected at the time of inspection. The suggestion is 

denied that there was no tampering in the meter. 

</p><p id="p_6">6.            PW­3   Sudeep   Bhattacharya   is   an   assessing   officer   .   A 

show cause notice dated 28.3.2006 was issued at the spot in the name 

of accused No 1 showing accused No 2 as user.  The accused refused 

to   accept   the   notice   which   was   sent   by   post.     He   checked   the 

consumption pattern from 23.2.05 to 25.6.05. The meter had recorded 

only 10 units from 25.6.05 to 28.3.06 and recorded consumption was 

only 13.2 % of the assessed consumption.  He passed speaking order 

Ex. CW2/7 dated 25.4.2006.  In the cross examination, he stated that 

he has no knowledge accused was running any industry or not at the 

time of inspection. It is correct that no artificial means of abstraction 

were found at the time of inspection. It is correct that accuracy of 

meter was within limits and meter was recording correct consumption 

of   units.     It   is   correct   that  there   was   no  theft  of   electricity  in  the 

premises at the time of inspection. It is correct that meter was not 

subjected to laboratory test.  
</p>
<p id="p_7">7.            Ld counsel for the complainant submitted that it was the 

duty of the consumer to maintain the meter.  He submitted that  meter 

                                                                   CC No. 105/11/06
                                                                        23.09.2011
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                  Page 6 of 11</span>



was   found   tampered   at   the time  of   inspection  so  the burden  shifts 

upon the consumer to show that there was no tampering in the meter. 

He   further   submitted   that   consumption   pattern   coupled   with   the 

observations made by the members of inspection show that there was 

tampering in the meter.   Ld counsel for the accused submitted that 

there is nothing on the record to show that there was any interference 

on the part of accused to disturb the internal mechanism of the meter. 

He further submitted that accu­check instrument was not put to use in 

order to see whether meter is recording correct consumption or not. 

He   further   submitted   that   consumption   pattern   is   not   a   foolproof 

method to determine dishonest abstraction of energy. 

</p><p id="p_8">8.          I   have   heard   ld   counsel   for   complainant,   ld   counsel   for 

accused and perused the record.     The complainant has to link the 

accused with the inspected premises either as a owner or user.   The 

complainant has to show that there was any tampering in the meter 

and said tampering was done by the accused in order to disturb the 

consumption pattern.  
</p>
<p id="p_9">9.            It is for the complainant to prove the case of dishonest 

abstraction   of   energy.   Regulation   2   (m)   of   Delhi   Electricity 

Regulatory   Commission   (Performance   Standards­Metering   and 

Billing) Regulation 2002 says that dishonest abstraction of energy 

                                                              CC No. 105/11/06
                                                                   23.09.2011
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                   Page 7 of 11</span>



shall   mean   abstraction   of   electrical   energy   where   accessibility   to 

internal  mechanism  of the metering equipment and some collateral 

evidence is found to support the conclusion that the meter has been 

caused to record less energy than actually passing through it.  It shall 

also include any other means adopted by the consumer to cause the 

meter to stop or run slow (such as reversing the polarity of one phase 

of poly phase meter, changes in CT or PT etc.). Regulation 25 and 26 

also deal with the dishonest abstraction of energy.  

</p><p id="p_10">10.            In order to draw a presumption of dishonest abstraction 

of energy in terms of second proviso of <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_5">Section 135</a> (1) of the Act, the 

complainant must discharge the burden to the effect that any artificial 

mean   or   means   not   authorized   by   board   or   licencee   exist   for 

abstraction, consumption or use of electricity by the consumer failing 

which   the   burden   of   proof   does   not   shift   to   the   consumer   under 

second proviso to <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_6">section 135</a> (1) of the Act.  
</p>
<p id="p_11">11.          In Jagdish Narayan Vs NDPL, 140 (2007) DLT 307, it was 

held by their Lordship that an automatic presumption of DAE on the 

basis of external symptoms of tampering together with the analysis of 

consumption pattern would not be a safe and error free method. Some 

other tangible evidence must exist.  An accu­check meter can be used 

to find out if meter is infact recording lesser units.  The analysis of 

                                                              CC No. 105/11/06
                                                                   23.09.2011
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                   Page 8 of 11</span>



consumption   pattern   in   terms   of   Regulation   26   (ii)   is   merely 

corroborated and not by itself a substantive evidence of DAE.   The 

decision of this court in Uddham Singh Vs BSES RPL 136 (2007) 

DLT 500 is to the same effect. In fact, the formula is applied in terms 

of Regulation 25 (iv) read with Regulation 26 (ii) for determining the 

penalty  payable  by consumer once a case of either DT or DAE is 

made out.   The penalty formula cannot itself is a proof of DAE or 

theft. 
</p>
<p id="p_12">12.         In J K Steelo Melt Pvt Ltd Vs BSES RPL 140 (2007) DLT 

563, it was held by their Lordship that there must be some tangible 

evidence to show that there has been tampering with or assessed by 

the petitioner to the internal mechanism of the meter in a manner that 

would slow down the consumption. This could be, for instance, in the 

form   of   accu­check   instrument   being   used   to   detect   if   meter   is 

recording lesser consumption.   
</p>
<p id="p_13">13.         The   arguments   of   ld   counsel   for   the   parties   have   to   be 

assessed in the light of provisions of the Act and Regulations coupled 

with the case law referred to above. It is admitted fact that inspection 

of the premises was carried out on 28.3.2006 by the members of joint 

inspection team including PW­2. The meter No 0027669 was installed 

in the name of accused No 1. Accused No 2 is the user of the premises 

                                                               CC No. 105/11/06
                                                                    23.09.2011
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                    Page 9 of 11</span>



and this fact is nowhere  controverted by the accused.  The question 

that   needs   consideration   is   whether   meter   in   question   was   found 

tampered   or   not.   A   bare   perusal   of   the   testimony   of   PW­2   and   3 

shows that no artificial means  of abstraction were found in the meter 

at   the   time   of   inspection.     The   meter   was   recording   correct 

consumption and there was no theft of electricity.  PW­2 admitted that 

no external material was found to hinder the operation of the meter. 

Their testimony clearly shows that no artificial means like any device 

or film or shunt was found in the meter in order to slow down the 

consumption  of the units.   There was no theft of electricity as the 

meter was recording correct consumption.   No accurate accu­check 

apparatus was used by the members of inspection team to determine if 

the meter was recording less energy.   It appears that members of joint 

inspection team have come to the conclusion of their own by seeing 

the meter with the naked eye for the reasons best known to them.  The 

speaking   order   reflects   that   inference   of   dishonest   abstraction   of 

energy is based on presumption and thus applied the LDHF formula 

by   going   through   the   consumption   pattern.     The   analysis   of 

consumption   pattern   in   terms   of     Regulation   26   (ii)   is   merely 

corroborated and not by itself or substantive evidence of DAE.  The 

complainant has applied the formula to levy the penalty on the 

                                                               CC No. 105/11/06

automatic   presumption   that   DAE   stands   established.     There   is   no 

evidence   on   record   that   there   was   tampering   with   the   internal 

mechanism of the meter or any artificial means were found at the spot 

or used by the accused to tamper with the meter or any accu­check 

apparatus was used to check the slowness of the meter.   Support is 

drawn from Bhasin Motors India Pvt Ltd Vs NDPL, WP(C) 18328/04 

decided   on   21.5.07   by   our   own   High   Court;   Jagdish   Narayan   Vs 

NDPL and  J K Steelo Melt Pvt Ltd Vs BSES RPL supra.

</p><p id="p_14">14.         The meter in question was not seized.   The analysis of the 

meter in the laboratory is another method to determine whether there 

was any tampering in the meter or not because oral observations are 

not   enough   to   displace   the scientific analysis.    The meter  was not 

seized so the question of its testing in the lab is out of question. No 

explanation is forthcoming why the meter was not seized.  It calls for 

an adverse inference against the complainant.  

</p><p id="p_15">15.         The evidence on the record is not enough to substantiate 

the allegations as set out by the complainant as such testimony of PWs 

does not inspire confidence.

<p id="p_16">16.         In the light of my aforesaid discussion, I have no hesitation 

to hold that complainant company has failed to bring home the guilt 

against the accused beyond shadow of reasonable doubt and
