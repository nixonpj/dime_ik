IN
S.B.CIVIL WRIT PETITION NO. 12555/2010

NATHU RAM BHASKAR
VS.
STATE OF RAJASTHAN &amp; OTHERS.

DATE OF JUDGMENT      :            27.09.2012

HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE NARENDRA KUMAR JAIN-I
HON'BLE MISS. JUSTICE BELA M. TRIVEDI

Mr. Vinod Goyal, for the appellant.
Ms. Raj Sharma, Addl. G.C., for the respondents.

BY THE COURT:</pre>
<p id="p_1">		Heard finally with the consent of learned counsel for the parties.
</p><p id="p_2">2.		This intra Court appeal is directed against order dated 31st May, 2011, whereby S.B. Civil Writ Petition No. 12555/2010 filed by the petitioner/appellant, challenging order of punishment dated 8th July, 2010, whereby appellant's 10% pension was stopped for a period of five years, has been dismissed.
</p><p id="p_3">3.		Briefly stated the facts of the case are that a charge sheet was served upon the appellant under Rule 16 of the Rajasthan Civil Services(Classification, Control and Appeal)Rules, 1958 along with other delinquent officers.  Ultimately, vide order dated 8th July, 2010, it was directed that 10% pension of the appellant be stopped for a period of five years.  Said order of penalty was challenged by the appellant before the Single Bench.  The Single Bench vide order dated 31st May, 2011, dismissed the writ petition.  Hence, this intra Court appeal has been preferred.
</p><p id="p_4">4.		Initially learned counsel for both the parties argued the case at length, but during the course of arguments, learned counsel for the appellant confined his arguments and submitted that he is not challenging the order of punishment, so far as stoppage of 10% pension of the appellant for a period of five years is concerned.  His submission is that the appellant retired from the service way back in the year 2001, but till date his pension case has not been finalised and he has not been paid full pension for earlier period.  He has submitted that the appellant has also not been paid the gratuity and other retiral benefits, which became due to him.  He, therefore, submitted that it may be clarified that appellant's 10% pension may be stopped for the period beginning from the date of passing of penalty order i.e. 8th July, 2010, for a period of five years.  So far as earlier period, i.e. from the date of appellant's retirement till the date of passing of penalty order, is concerned, the respondents may be directed to prepare and finalise pension case of the appellant and he may be paid his due amount of pension and other pensionary benefits.
</p><p id="p_5">5.		Learned counsel for the respondents fairly and frankly admitted that the respondents are entitled to stop 10% pension of the appellant for a period of five years only, in view of penalty order dated 8th July, 2010, which has not been challenged by learned counsel for the appellant.  She further submitted that pension case of the appellant will be prepared and finalised at the earliest.  She has prayed that some reasonable time may be granted for the same.  
</p><p id="p_6">6.		As agreed by learned counsel for both the parties, special appeal is disposed off as under:
</p><p id="p_7">(i) Pension case of the appellant shall be prepared and finalised by the respondents and appellant will be paid his pension including arrears and other retiral benefits with interest within a period of two months.
</p>
<p id="p_8">(ii) 10% pension of the appellant will be stopped for a period of five years with effect from the date of passing of penalty order dated 8th July, 2010 till 7th July, 2015.  Remaining amount of pension during this period will be paid to the appellant regularly.
</p>
<p id="p_9">(iii) Whatever amount has been paid to the appellant on account of provisional pension or other retiral benefits, if any, be deducted from the due claim of the appellant. 
</p><p id="p_10">7.		Cost of the special appeal is made easy.           
</p>
