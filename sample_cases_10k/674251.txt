<p id="p_1">	This Civil Revision Petition is filed against the Order dated 24.9.2007 passed in P.O.P.No.288 of 2006 on the file of the Principal District Judge, Coimbatore.
</p>
<p id="p_2">	2. The respondents 1 and 2 in O.P.No.288 of 2006 are the revision petitioners before this court.  They are aggrieved by the order of the trial court dated 24.9.2007, permitting the first respondent herein to sue as an indigent person.
</p>
<p id="p_3">	3. O.P.No.288 of 2006 has been filed by the respondent herein under Order 33 Rule 1 &amp; 2 of C.P.C., for the following reliefs:
</p><p id="p_4">1. declaring the plaintiff as an indigent person and allowing him to continue the suit as an indigent person.
</p><p id="p_5">2. declaring the exclusive/absolute right, title and interest of the plaintiff in the suit property.
</p><p id="p_6">3. directing the defendants to deliver the suit property to the plaintiff as it is and without making any structural variation or alterations to the buildings or machinery.
</p><p id="p_7">4. directing the defendants to pay a sum of Rs.25,00,000/- towards past damages or mesne profits for illegal use and occupation of the suit property.
</p><p id="p_8">5. directing the defendants to pay future damages or mesne profits for continued illegal use and occupation of the suit  property even after this suit, at the rate of Rs.5000/- per day from the date of suit till date of actual delivery to the plaintiff.
</p><p id="p_9">6. directing the defendants to pay the court fees to the Govt. and the remaining cost of the suit to the plaintiff.
</p>
<p id="p_10">	4. According to the first respondent herein, he is an indigent person possessing no other movable or immovable property excepting the suit property and the plaint B schedule property.  As on date, he is depending on his younger brother for food, clothing and shelter, for himself and his family members.  He further averred that he has not disposed of any movable or immovable property during the past three months and he has not entered into any agreement with any person.  The first respondent has also added the District Collector, Coimbatore District as the third respondent in O.P.No.288 of 2006.
</p>
<p id="p_11">	5. The trial court by order dated 24.9.2007 permitted the first respondent to sue as an indigent person and aggrieved by the same, respondents 1 and 2 in the O.P. filed the above revision petition under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_2">Article 227</a> of the Constitution of India by contending that the trial court has not followed the procedure contemplated under Order 33 C.P.C.
</p>
<p id="p_12">	6. Heard the learned counsel for the  petitioners and  the learned counsel for the first respondent/Caveator. I have also gone through the documents and judgment filed in support of their  submissions.
</p><p id="p_13">	7. Relying on the judgment of a Division Bench of this court reported in 2004(1) L.W. 335 (Minor Cibiraj &amp; another Vs C.Marimuth &amp; others), the learned counsel for the revision petitioners submits that courts have to follow the mandatory procedures and rules contemplated under Order 33 Rule 1, 1(A), 2 and 5 C.P.C. and failure to do so will result in illegality being committed in the order passed by the trial court.
</p>
<p id="p_14">	8. I am unable to accept the submission made by the learned Senior counsel for the revision petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_15">	9. The first respondent herein has filed O.P.No.288 of 2006 under Order 33 Rule 1 &amp; 2 C.P.C. to declare himself as an indigent person and to allow him to continue the suit in that capacity.  In the petition itself, he added the District Collector as the third respondent.  The first respondent herein has made necessary averment in para 21 of the petition and declared his assets in the plaint B schedule property.  The revision petitioners/ respondents 1 &amp; 2 did not examine anyone, whereas the first respondent has examined himself before the trial court.  In such circumstances, I do not find any illegality in the order passed by the trial court permitting the first person to sue as an indigent person.  The Division Bench judgment relied on by the revision petitioners is not helpful to them as the facts in that case are totally different from the facts of the present case.
</p>
<p id="p_16">	10. In the result,  I find no merits in the Civil Revision petition and the same is dismissed.  No costs.  M.P.No.1 of 2008 for stay is also dismissed.
