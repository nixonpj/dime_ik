<p id="p_1">1­       This order will dispose of the objections filed by the objector /

respondent to the award alleging therein that as per the judgment of

the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in K. K. Modi Vs K. N. Modi &amp;

Another   reported   in   1998   (1)   RLR   296.     There   is   no   specific

agreement between the parties.   This objections was raised before

the  arbitrator,  who declined   to accept   the  judgment  of the  Hon'ble

Supreme Court of India stating that it pertains to Act 1940.  

</p><p id="p_2">2. On the other hand Ld. counsel for respondent to the objection has

     cited   judgment   of   90   (2001)   Delhi   Law   Times   724   M/s   P.   C.

     Chandha &amp; Co. (P) Ltd. Vs Union of India &amp; Another of Hon'ble

     High   Court   wherein   it   was   held   that   an   arbitration   clause   exists

     between the parties and it cannot be made otoise by interpreting

     the same.  My attention is drawn by the  Ld. counsel for objector
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                      3</span>

through the judgment of K.K. Modi Vs K.N. Modi (Supra) wherein

important   ingredients   for   agreement   mentioned   in  para­17  which

reads as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_3">"Among the attributes which must be present for an agreement to

be considered as an arbitration agreement are:

(1) The arbitration agreement must contemplate that the decision

of the tribunal will be binding on the parties to the agreement.

(2)   That the jurisdiction of the tribunal who decides the rights of

the parties must derive either from the consent of the parties or

from  an  order  of  the  court  or  from  a  statute   the   terms  of  which

make it clear that the process is to be an arbitration.

(3)   The   agreement   must   contemplate   that   substantive   rights   of

parties will be determined by the agreed tribunal:

(4)   That the tribunal will determine the rights of the parties in a

impartial   and   judicial   manner   with   the   tribunal   owing   an   equal
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                           4</span>

     obligation of fairness towards both sides.
</p>
<p id="p_4">     (5)That the agreement of the parties to refer their disputes to the

       decision of the tribunal must be intended to be enforceable in

       law and lastly.
</p>
<p id="p_5">     (6) The agreement must contemplate that the tribunal will make a

       decision upon a dispute which is already formulated at the time

       when a reference is made to the tribunal.
</p>
<p id="p_6">3.      Counsel for the objector has argued that in the judgment cited

by the Ld counsel for respondent herein the arbitration clause section

24 decide by Hon'ble High Court of Delhi the important ingredients as

mentioned   in   judgment   in   K.K.Modi     Vs   K.N.Modi   (Supra)   were

present.   The   arbitration   clause   read   as   follows   in   the   judgment   of

Hon'ble High Court :
</p>
<p id="p_7">"Clause   24.   Arbitration­   in   the   event   of   any   question,   dispute   or

difference arising under these conditions or any special conditions or
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                               5</span>

contract,   or   in   connection   with   this   contract,   (except   as   to   any

matters the decision of which is specially provided for by these or the

special conditions.) The same shall be referred to the sole arbitration

of an officer in the Ministry of Law, appointed to be the arbitrator by

the Director General of Supplies &amp; Disposals. It will be no objection

that   the   arbitrator   is   a   govt.   servant,   that   he   had   to   deal   with   the

matters   to   which   the   contract   relates   or   that   in   the   course   of   his

duties as a Govt. servant he has expressed view on all or any of the

matters in dispute or difference. The award of the arbitrator shall be

final and binding on the parties to this contract.

</p><p id="p_8">4. The important ingredients of exclusive jurisdiction of the arbitrator

   and   the   conditions   attached   to   it   have   been   made   part   of   the

   arbitration clause in the judgment cited before this court pertaining

   to   the   judgment   of   Hon'ble   High   Court   of   Delhi   whereas   in   the

   clause 31 reads as follows:
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                         6</span><p id="p_9">

   "Clause 31­ In case of any disputes an arbitrator can be  appointed

   by   the   company   at   New   Delhi   and   decided   at   New   Delhi   by

   arbitrator or by the Court at New Delhi."
</p>
<p id="p_10">5.     Counsel   for  respondent   has argued that this clause  talks  of

   decision   by   the   court   in   some   of   the   matters   in   terms   and

   provisions of the <a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_1">Arbitration Act</a> can be disposed off by the courts

   only. Hence it is mentioned that decision of the arbitrator and the

   court   will  be final.  I  have  carefully perused  the clause  31 in the

   agreement and judgment of Hon'ble High Court of Delhi reported in

   2001   III   (DELHI)   192   titled   as   "Abdul   Gaffar     Vs.   Delhi

   Development   Authority"   wherein   the   paragraph   cited   by   the

   arbitrator is not in the ratio of the judgment of Hon'ble Mr. Justice

   Vikramajit   Sen   as   specifically   stated   that   case   of   my   opinion

   expressed hereinafter I considered it un­necessary to give the final

   view on this issue and this issue was not in the ratio of judgment of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                          7</span>

   the   Hon'ble  High  Court  of   Delhi reported  by  Hon'ble  Mr.  Justice

   Vikramajit   Sen,   as   the   important   ingredients   of   finality   of   the

   exclusive   jurisdiction   of   arbitrator   and   nothing   have   been

   mentioned in the clause 31 of the arbitration agreement.  

</p><p id="p_11">6.     I   have   considered   the   view   of   counsel   for   petitioner/objector

   well founded. There is no     arbitrator agreement in terms of the

   judgment   of   K.K.Modi   Vs.   K.N.Modi   and   Anrs.   Hence,   award   is

   without   any  jurisdiction.  The  same  is set  aside.  However,  in  the

   facts and circumstances   parties to bear their own costs. File be

   consigned to Record Room.
