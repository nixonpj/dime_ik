              Writ Appeal No.358/2016
07.11.2016
    Shri Pushyamitra          Bhargava,     learned     Deputy
Advocate General for the appellant / State.
     Shri M.M. Bohra, learned counsel for respondent
No.1, on advance notice.
     Heard on the question of admission.
                         ORDER
</pre><p id="p_1">     The question involved in this writ appeal is
squarely covered by a Division Bench decision of this
Court in Writ Appeal No.372/2015 (<a href="/doc/370168/" id="a_1">The State of
Madhya Pradesh v. Dr. Surendra Kumar Gupta
&amp; another</a>) decided on 29.01.2016; which reads, as
under: -
</p><p id="p_2">   "By this intra court appeal filed under Section 2 (1) of
   M.P. Uchha Nyayalay (Khand Nyaya Peeth Ko Appeal)
   Adhiniyam, 2005, the appellants - State is, assailing
   the validity of the order dated 3.2.2015 passed in Writ
   Petition No.12169 of 2013(S).
</p><p id="p_3">   2.    Brief facts of the case are that respondent is a
   retired professor who had attained the age of
   superannuation after serving with the Vikram
   University, Ujjain on 31.7.2002, on account of non
   grant of pensionary benefits, as has been extended to
   the State Government's Employees vide notification
   dated 3.8.2009, filed a writ petition for issuance of
   writ of mandamus directing the appellants/State for
   grant of pension and gratuity to its employees on the
   ground that by virtue of Statue No.37, a consolidated
   fund has been created, which is under control of the
   State Government and State Government is regularly
   paying pension to the respondent and other retired
   benefits to other employees of Vikram University,
   Ujjain. It was also contended that by virtue of Statute
   No.37, the provisions of M.P. Civil Service (Pension)
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                             2</span>


Rules, 1976 and M.P. Civil Pension (Commutation)
Rules, 1976 as amended from time to time as
applicable to the State Government employees are also
applicable to the respondent who is a retired employee
of the University.
</p><p id="p_4">3.    The learned writ court, relying on the decision of
the Apex Court in the case of D.S. Nakara &amp; Ors.
V/s. Union of India reported as 1983 (1) SCC 305
and the decision of Chhatisgarh High Court, Bilaspur
in W.P. No.196/2011[S] (Santosh Kumar
Upadhyay &amp; Ors. V/s. State of Chhattisgarh &amp;
Ors.), allowed the writ petition by holding that, the
respondent being the employee of the University is
entitled to all the benefits at par with the Government
employees and directed to them to grant retired
benefits to the respondent as revised from time to
time in accordance with the provisions of Statute
No.37, as per the circular dated 3.8.2009.
</p><p id="p_5">4.    It is submitted by the learned Deputy Advocate
General that the learned writ court, totally misread the
Notification dated 3.8.2009, by which guidelines were
issued for calculating the pensionary benefit of the
Government employees who stood retired prior to
1.1.2006, and Statute No.37 promulgated by Vikram
University, Ujjain, for grant of pension as the
Notification dated 3.8.2009 is applicable in the case of
Government       employees     and    admittedly     the
respondent was under the employment of Vikram
University, which is not the Government service. It is
also pointed out that at no point of time, the claim of
the respondent has been negatived by the State
Government. In fact, the State Government had issued
the circulars to the effect that the pensionary benefit
as admissible to the Government Servant under M.P.
Civil Pension Rules, 1976 and M.P. Civil Pension
(Commutation) Rules, 1976 would be applicable to the
employees of the University and thus, no
discrimination      was       made       either     with
petitioner/respondent or similarly situated employees,
but the question of the liability to make the said
payment had wrongly been construed by the learned
writ court with the management of the fund.
</p><p id="p_6">5.   On the other hand, learned counsel for the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                 3</span>


respondent has drawn our attention to the Gwalior
Bench decision, which is at page No.43 and the
decision of the Chattisgarh High Court in the case of
Santosh Kumar Upadhyay (supra) and the letter
issued by the State Government 26.7.2000 (Annexure
P/8) and submitted that for the purpose of payment of
pension and gratuity MP Ucchcha Shiksha Anudan
Ayog, 1973 was constituted and this Ayog was granted
pension and other benefits to the University
employees from the fund created by Act No.6 of 1994.
The State Government has passed Madhya Pradesh
Uchcha Shiksha Anudan Ayog (Nirsan) Adhiniyam,
1994, Sub-section (2) of Section 3 provides that all
assets and liabilities of the Ayog on the appointed day
shall stand vested in the State Government and the
State Government shall have all powers necessary to
take possession, recover and deal with such assets and
to discharge such liabilities. By virtue of the aforesaid
Adhiniyam, the State Government is vested with the
powers to discharge liabilities of the Ayog. The State
Government is bound to discharge the liability of the
Ayog. The pensioners are entitled for the pension,
gratuity and commutation at par with the employees
of the State Government and submitted that the
Notification of the State Government for it's
pensioners and employees is applicable to the
employees of the University and prayed for dismissal
of the writ appeal. Para 3 to 6 of Order dated
25.2.1999 passed in W.P. No.1736/1996 (K.L.
Khandelwal &amp; Anr. V/s. State of M.P. &amp; Ors.)
reads as under :-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">    "3.    Petitioner No.1 is retired as Deputy
    Registrar of Jiwaji University, Gwalior. Petitioner
    No.2 is a Society of the pensioners of the University
    employees. The University employees have raised a
    dispute in respect of payment of pension and other
    retirement benefits at par with the State
    Government employees. The State Government
    considered these facts and passed an order dated
    6.12.1989 that the University employees shall get
    benefits at par with the State Government
    employees in respect of pension, gratuity, family
    pension and commutation of pension. In this
    circular it was written that no assistance shall be
    given by the State Government and this facility
    shall be given by the contributory provident fund of

    the University. Thereafter, the pension and gratuity
    was being paid by the M.P. Uchcha Shiksha Ayog.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">    4.      Counsel for the respondents submitted that
    the State Government has agreed that University
    employees are entitled to some facilities in respect
    of pension and other retirement benefits as per
    with the State Government employees, but the
    Government has not accepted the liability.
    However, for the purpose of payment of pension
    and gratuity, M.P. Uchcha Shiksha Anudan Ayog
    Adhiniyam, 1973 was constituted and this Ayog was
    paying pension and other benefits to the University
    employees from the fund created by Act No.6 of
    1994. The State Government has passed Madhya
    Pradesh Uchcha Shiksha Anudan Ayog (Nirsen)
    Adhiniyam 1994. Under sub-section (2) of Section
    3 of the aforesaid Adhiniyam, all the assets and
    liabilities of the Ayog on the appointed day shall
    stand vested in the State Government and the State
    Government shall have all powers necessary to take
    possession, recover and deal with such assets and
    discharge such liabilities.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">    5.     By virtue of the aforesaid Adhiniyam, the
    State Government is vested with the powers to
    discharge liabilities of the Ayog. The State
    Government is bound to discharge the liability of
    the Ayog. In view of the order dated 6.12.1989,
    Annexure R/1, the petitioners are entitled for
    pension, gratuity, family pension and commutation
    at par with the employees of the State Government.
    Thus the notification of the State Government for
    its pensioners and employees is applicable to the
    employees of the University.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">    6.     On facts mentioned above, the petition
    succeeds and is allowed. It is directed that the
    petitioners are entitled for all the benefits granted
    by the State Government in respect of gratuity,

    respondents are directed to pay all the dues to its
    pensioners. The petitioners shall be entitled to all
    the benefits in pension, D.A. under the notification
    by the State Government for its pensioners. Any
    recovery made from the petitioners. Any recovery
    made from the petitioner No.1 be also refunded.
    However, there shall be no order as to costs."

<p id="p_7">6.   The learned writ Court after considering the
arguments of the learned counsel for the parties
passed the impugned order. Para 8 to 11 of the
impugned order dated 3.2.2015 passed in W.P.

          University as University share together with interest
          thereon (upto the date of transfer of the amount by
          University) will be credited to the University Employees
          Pension and Gratuity Fund (UNIPENGRAF) maintained at
          the level of the MP. Ucchcha Shiksha Anudan Ayog. The
          University share of the employee who have opted to retain
          the Contributory Provident Fund Scheme, will not be
          transferred to the University Employees Pension and
          Gratuity Fund (UNIPENGRAF) but shall be continued to
          be maintained separately as per provisions of the existing
          Contributory Provident Fund Scheme under Statute
          No.26. In order to implement the pension Scheme, the
          Registrar of the University will ensure that atleast 90% of
          the accumulated balance of University share is credited to
          University     Employees      Pension      and      Gratuity
          Fund(UNIPENGRAF) within one month from the date of
          promulgation of the statute. Only such employees in
          respect of whom 90% of the University share is credited to
          the pension fund within prescribed time shall be covered
          under the scheme. Where a University has granted house
          building advance to any employee to the extent of 75% of
          the total amount of CPF as provided in the relevant
          Statute, the condition regarding deposit of 90% of
          University share due to an employee could be relaxed by
          the M.P. Uchcha Shiksha Anudan Ayog on merits of each
          case. For this purpose the M.P.U.S.A.A. would be
          competent to issue necessary directions and such
          directions will be binding on the University. Where
          M.P.U.S.A.A. has granted relaxation in respect of an
          employee, such employee would be covered by this
          scheme. The remaining amount of 10% of the university
          share with interest shall be deposited by the Registrar in

</p>
<p id="p_12">   a) When calculating the pension, family pension, gratuity

   and the M.P. Civil Pension (Commutation) Rules, 1976 as
   amended from time to time by the Government shall be
   applicable mutatis-mutandis."
</p>
<p id="p_13">09.     The aforesaid provision of law makes it very
clear that while calculating pension, family pension,
gratuity and commutation in respect of retired
employees of Vikram University, Ujjain, the
provisions of the Madhya Pradesh Civil Services
(Pension) Rules, 1976 and the Madhya Pradesh Civil
Pension (Commutation) Rules, 1976 as amended from
time to time by the Government shall be applicable
mutatis-mutandis. Not only this, the Chhattisgarh
High Court while dealing with the similar controversy
in paragraphs 8 to 17 held as under in Writ Petition (s)
No. 196/2011 (Santosh Kumar Upadhyay and others
Vs. State of Chhattisgarh and others):-
</p>
<p id="p_14">  "8. Clause 9 of Statute No.32 provides for
  contribution for creation of employees pension
  and gratuity fund. It is further provided that
  each employee will make a contribution to the
  fund and the University will also contribute the
  same amount to the said fund. The said fund
  shall be centrally controlled and administered by
  the Madhya Pradesh Uchha Shiksha Anudan
  Ayog/Department of Higher Education. It is
  further provided that the grant-in-aid sanctioned
  by the Government from time to time will be
  made to cover the deficiency of funds in running
  the Pension and Gratuity Scheme.
</p>
<p id="p_15">  9.     Clause-13 of Statute No.32 provides for
  procedure Regulating the Payment of Pension
  and Gratuity to the Employees and clause 14
  provides for procedure for Pension and Gratuity
  Payment to the University Employees.
</p><p id="p_16">  10.     It is well settled principle of law that
  pension is not a bounty payable on the sweet will
  and pleasure of the Government and that, on the
  other hand, the right of pension is a valuable
  right vesting in a Government servant (see
  Deokinandan Prasad Vs. The State of Bihar and
  others SCC pg. 344 para-31).
</p>
<p id="p_17">  11.    The Supreme Court recently in Pepsu
  Road Transport Corporation, Patiala Vs. Mangal
  Singh and others, observed as under :-
</p>
<p id="p_18">     "34. Pension is a retirement benefit partaking of
     the character of regular payment to a person in
     consideration of the past services rendered by

                him. We hasten to add that although pension is
                not a bounty but is claimable as a matter of
                right, yet the right is not absolute or
                unconditional. The person claiming pension

                must establish his entitlement to such pension
                in law. The entitlement might be dependent
                upon various considerations or conditions. In a
                given case, the retired employee is entitled to
                pension or not depend on the provisions and
                interpretation             of     Rules    and
                Regulations....................."
</p>
<p id="p_19">It is further held that :-

            made under the statute laying down the terms

            including the grant of retirement benefits, has
            the force of law. The Regulations validly made

    provision of law and the judgment delivered in an identical
    case is of the considered opinion that the petitioner, who is a
    retired employee of Vikram University cannot be
    discriminated in the matter of grant of pension as the
    provisions of Madhya Pradesh Civil Services (Pension) Rules,
    1976 are applicable mutatis-mutandis in case of thepetitioner
    also, by virtue of Statute No.37.

<blockquote id="blockquote_15">    11. It has also been brought to the notice of this court that the
    Professors working under the State of Madhya Pradesh and
    in Vikram University, Ujjain are receiving the same pay scale
    and, therefore, the action of the respondents is amounting to
    disparity, within the same rank. In light of the aforesaid, it
    can be safely gathered that the action of the respondents
    which brings disparity between the same rank specially when
    same rules are applicable to all persons in the matter of grant
    of pension, the petitioner is being discriminated vis-a-vis his
    counter parts who have attained the age of superannuation
    from the services of the State of Madhya Pradesh.

Constitution of University Employees Pension and

employee will make a contribution to the fund and the
University will also contribute the same amount to the
said fund. The said fund shall be centrally controlled
and administered by the Madhya Pradesh Uchha
Shiksha Anudan Ayog/Department of Higher
Education. It is further provided that the grant-in-aid
sanctioned by the Government from time to time will
be made to cover the deficiency of funds in running
the Pension and Gratuity Scheme.

not a bounty payable on the sweet will and pleasure of
the Government and that, on the other hand, the right
of pension is a valuable right vesting in a Government

     possession, recover and deal with such assets and to
     discharge such liabilities. Thus, all the responsibilities

     State Government employees in accordance with the
