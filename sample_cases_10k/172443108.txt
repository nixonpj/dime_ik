<pre id="pre_1">                     HON'BLE SRI JUSTICE S.V. BHATT

                          W.P. No.32146 OF 2016
ORDER:
</pre>
<p id="p_1">      Heard Mr.V.Sudhakar Reddy for petitioners and the learned

Assistant Government Pleader for respondents.

</p><p id="p_2">      The petitioners assail the order of 2nd respondent in Appeal

No.3/2015 dated 21.12.2015 confirming the order of 3rd respondent

in Document No.2/2015 dated 29.04.2015 refusing to register sale

deed P.No.07/2015 dated 13.02.2015.              The subject matter of the

pending document dated 13.02.2015 is Ac.1-11 cents in Survey

No.514/16 at Ponnada Revenue Village, Etcherla Mandal, Ponduru

Sub-Division, Srikakulam District.
</p>
<p id="p_3">      The 3rd respondent through refusal endorsement dated

29.04.2015 recorded the following reasons and refused to register

the document.       The operative portion, for convenience and to

avoid repetition, is excerpted below:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">             "Though it forms no part of the Registering Officer as
          to the validity, legality or property of the claims, vis-a-vis
          the land, or its character as per Rule 58 of the
          Registration Rules but when the Registering Officer is
          informed that there are restraining alienation orders by
          any Civil Court as per S.O.219 of Part II A.P. Registration
          Mannual as amended in G.O.Ms.No.620, Revenue
          (Regn.1) Department, dt. 28.9.2002 and G.O.Ms.No.497,
          Revenue (Reg.I) Department, dt.7.4.2003.            When a
          competent Court of law pass an order of temporary
          injunction or a decree of perpetual injunction, prohibiting
          alienation of properties that the registering authority can
          refuse Registration.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">              Hence, as per S.O.219 of Part II A.P. Registration
          Manual as amended in G,.O.Ms.No.620, Revenue
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                        2</span>




          (Regn.I) Department, dt.28.9.2002 and G.O.Ms.No.497,
          Revenue (Regn.I) Department dt.7.4.2003, if the Andhra
          Pradesh High Court or any other Civil Court restrains a
          person from alienating a property and if such orders are
          brought to the notice of the Registering Officers or served
          on the Registering Officer, the Registering Officer is
          stopped from going ahead with the Registration.
              Accordingly the registration of the property in the
          document in question is under the restraining alienation
          in I.A.No.238/2011 in O.S.No.5/2011 of the Hon'ble
          Principal District Judge, Srikakulam which has also been
          confirmed by the Hon'ble High Court of A.P., Hyderabad
          in CMA 1194/2011, 3.11.2011.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">              In the circumstances I have no option, but to desist
          from registering the document.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">              I am, therefore, satisfied that the document is refused
          under Sec.71 of the Registration Act, 1908 as regards
          property an extent of Ac.1.11 cents of Dry land in
          Sy.No.514/16 situated at Ponnada Revenue Village,
          Ponnada Panchayat, Etcherla Mandalam of Ponduru
          Sub-District of Srikakulam District."</blockquote><p id="p_4">


</p><p id="p_5">      The petitioners challenge the endorsement dated 29.04.2015

under <a href="/doc/100797/" id="a_1">Section 72</a> of the Registration Act,1908. The 2nd respondent

placed a cordant note by confirming the reasoning of 3rd

respondent in all material particulars. Perusal of both the orders

takes this Court to the fact in issue for consideration. One Batchu

Prabhavathi wife of Ananda Reddy instituted O.S. No.5 of 2011 on

the file of Principal District Judge, Srikakulam. The petitioners herein

are not the defendants in O.S. No.5 of 2011. On 05.09.2011, the

learned Principal District Judge granted interim injunction restraining

the defendants/respondents 1 to 4 from alienating the suit schedule

property in favour of respondents 5 and 6 therein.             By referring to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                            3</span>




the said order of injunction, the 3rd respondent issued the

endorsement dated 29.04.2015. The Standing Order 219 reads thus:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_5">            "An order restraining a person from alienating certain
            property does not operate as a prohibition to the
            registering officer against the registration of a document
            executed by such person affecting such property.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_6">            (b) If the A.P. High Court or any other Civil Court
            restrains a person from alienating a property and if such
            orders are brought to the notice of the Registering Officer
            or served on the Registering Officer, the Registering
            Officer   is     estopped   from    going   ahead   with   the
            registration."</blockquote><p id="p_6">


</p><p id="p_7">      The      Standing         Order     has      been     amended          through

G.O.Ms.No.620         dated       28.09.2002      and     G.O.Ms.No.497       dated

07.04.2003. Even if this Court takes into consideration the effect of

both the amendments, the Standing Order is operative in the

limited sphere of parties to the suit in which order of injunction is

granted by the civil Court. To the extent of completely refusing to

register the document presented by the 3rd party to the suit, this

Court had occasion to consider in W.P. No.11560 of 2011 and

W.P.No.1100 of 2012. The conclusion recorded therein is that an

order of injunction/stay in a suit or a petition would operate only

against the parties to it and does not bar 3rd parties.

</p><p id="p_8">      For the above reasons, I am satisfied that the orders of 2nd

and 3rd respondents are liable to be set aside and accordingly the

orders are set aside. The petitioners are given liberty to re-present

the document by enclosing a copy of this order and on such

presentation, the 3rd respondent, if the document otherwise is in

order, accepts registration in accordance with law.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                   4</span>




</p><p id="p_9">      The writ petition is ordered as indicated above. No order as

to costs.
</p>
<p id="p_10">
</p><p id="p_11">      Miscellaneous petitions pending, if any, shall stand closed.

                                                         S.V.BHATT, J
