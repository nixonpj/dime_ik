This is an appeal preferred against the judgment of the

Addl.Sessions Judge, Fast Tract Court No.1, Palakkad

Division, in Crl.A.No.209/1997. The said appeal arose out of

the conviction and sentence passed in S.T.No.3931/1996

filed u/s.138 of <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_1">Negotiable Instruments Act</a>. The brief facts

necessary for the disposal of the appeal are stated as follows

:- It is the case of the complainant, that the accused had

borrowed a sum of Rs.30,000/- for the conduct of his

daughter's marriage and had paid Rs.5,000/- and later

issued a cheque for the discharge of the entire liability and

when it was presented for enashment, it returned with

endorsement `insufficiency of funds' and hence the action.

The case of the defence as seen from the 313 question is to

the effect that he had borrowed a sum of Rs.25,000/- and

CRL.A.No.376 OF 2003
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                             2</span>

had paid Rs.5,000/- back and that he had furnished two

blank cheques as security for the amount and that he had not

issued Ext.P1 cheque at all. The trial court on appreciation

of the evidence found the case of the complainant to be true

and therefore, convicted the accused and sentenced him to

undergo imprisonment for a period of 2 months and to pay a

fine of Rs.5,000/- in default with a further imprisonment of

one month. It was against that decision the appeal was

preferred. The appellate court took stand that when the

amount advanced is only Rs.30,000/- and Rs.5,000/- is

admittedly received back, if a cheque of Rs.45,000/- is to be

issued, then the rate of interest would come to 40 % and

therefore held that it is not towards the discharge of a legally

enforcible liability. The learned counsel for the respondent

had sited the ruling of the Division Bench of this court

reported in Joseph Sartho V. Gopinathan Nair, 2008 (4) KLT

</p><p id="p_2">509. It was a case were the amount outstanding on the date

of the issuance of the cheque was Rs.4,61,400/-.           The

CRL.A.No.376 OF 2003
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                            3</span>

cheque was issued on 4.6.1999. On 9.6.1999, the accused

therein paid a sum of Rs.2,26,400/- and the balance due to

the complainant was only Rs.2,35,000/-.           But without

disclosing this factor at all, the cheque was presented for

encashment which ultimately got dishonoured. It was held

that even going by the admitted facts of the case, the amount

outstanding on the date of presentation of the cheque was

only Rs.2,35,000/- and therefore the presentation of the

cheque for the realisation of a larger amount will amount to

presenting negotiable instrument for a liability which is more

than what is really due. There can not be any quarrel with

the said proposition but whether the said decision can be

applied to the facts of the present case is the question to be

considered. Demanding exorbitant interest is there from time

immemorial. When the matter comes before the civil court,

the civil court by various provisions of law some times

declare that the interest claim is unconscionable. But prima

facie it has to be stated that when the parties enter into a

CRL.A.No.376 OF 2003
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                            4</span>

contract with both their eyes open and knowing the

consequences of what they are doing, the terms of the

contract can not be altered by the court, unless there are

specific circumstances to do so. In this case, no where the

accused has got the case of a unconscionable interest. His

case is that of issuing two blank signed cheques as security

for the transaction. The court of law is ordinarily expected to

answer the question of dispute that arises between the

parties and not to go out of the relam of the contract suo

moto and come to a conclusion which no party has. I am

afraid, that the learned Sessions Judge has misdirected

himself, most probably feeling of high percentage of interest

but that can not be done in a case where the party desires to

calculate the amount and issue the cheque towards the

discharge of the liability. So the said finding of the appellate

court can not be accepted.
</p>
<p id="p_3">      2.   Now so far as other facts are concerned, the

complainant has deposed before the court that he had

CRL.A.No.376 OF 2003
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                           5</span>

advanced a sum of Rs.30,000/- towards which, Rs.5,000/-

has been paid back and that the balance amount is covered

by Ext.P1 cheque. The case of the accused is that the he

had issued two blank signed cheques as security, is only a

contention for contention sake not substantiated by any

materials. I am conscious of the facts that in criminal cases

no accused can be compelled to let in evidence and that non

production of evidence by an accused can not be

commended upon by a court in view of the provisions of

S.315 of <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_2">Cr.P.C</a>. But in S.138 of Negotiable Instruments Act

cases when materials are supplied by both the sides, in order

to arrive at a decision regarding the correctness of the case,

the preponderance of probability of both versions can be

weighed to arrive at a decision. Here, we have got only one

sides evidence, that is of the prosecution and it has to be

held that PW1's       evidence is sufficient to prove the

advancement and issuance of the cheques towards the

discharge of the liability.     So far as other statutory

CRL.A.No.376 OF 2003
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                           6</span>

requirements are concerned PWs 2 and 3 had spoken about

them and so all ingredients necessary to constitute S.138 of

Negotiable Instruments Act has been established in this

case.   Therefore, I reverse the judgment of the appellate

court and confirm the conviction u/s.138 of <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_3">Negotiable

Instruments Act</a> passed by the trial court. Now comes the

question of sentence.     The trial court has sentenced the

accused to undergo imprisonment for a period of 2 months

and to pay a fine of Rs.5,000/- in default of which, a further

imprisonment for a period of one month. If the accused in

the case really wants to wipe off the liability, I do not want to

send him into prison and therefore, especially in the light of

the amended provisions of <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_4">Negotiable Instruments Act</a>, which

enables any competent court of jurisdiction to levy a fine of

double the amount of the cheque, I feel justice can be met by

directing to pay a fine instead of imprisonment. Therefore,

the criminal appeal is disposed of as follows :-

</p><p id="p_4">     1. The order of judgment of acquittal passed by the

CRL.A.No.376 OF 2003
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                            7</span>

          learned Sessions Judge is set aside.
</p>
<p id="p_5">     2. The accused is found guilty u/s.138 of <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_5">Negotiable

         Instruments Act</a> and is sentenced to pay a fine of

         Rs.45,000/- failing which he has to undergo simple

         imprisonment for a period of 2 months. When such

        amount is paid or realised, let that amount be

         disbursed to the complainant on proper application.

         The accused shall pay the fine on or before

        10.9.2009, failing which the trial court shall execute

         the sentence.
