Judgment on: 09/06/2016

Debasish Kar Gupta , J. :
</p>

<p id="p_2">      This appeal is directed against the impugned judgement by which the
writ application of the respondents/writ petitioners was allowed directing the
 appellants/respondents    to   refund   a   sum   of   Rs.14,24,678/-,   to   the
respondents which had been realised from the respondents as punitive
charges.
</p><p id="p_3">      The following facts and circumstances were taken into consideration by
the learned Single Judge while passing the impugned judgement:-
</p><p id="p_4">      Respondent No.1 purchased iron ore fines from Orissa Mineral
Development Company Limited, (hereinafter referred to as OMDC), a
Government of India enterprise. The said OMDC had a private siding. It was
served by Barajamda Railway Station having electronic-in-motion weight
bridge stand facility.
</p><p id="p_5">      On February12, 2009, 3700-M.T. of aforesaid iron ore fine was loaded
in the wagon at the above private siding of OMDC situated at Barjamda
Railway station on the basis of declaration of the weighment of consignment
in wagon-load by the respondent company.          According to the appellants,
weighment of above consignment was not feasible at the Barajamda Railway
Station due to congestion.
</p><p id="p_6">      On February 13, 2009, a railway receipt was issued in respect of the
above consignment by the appellant authority demanding an amount of Rs.
14, 24, 678/- from the respondent Company on account of punitive charges
for overloading after conducting weighment of wagon-load the consignment in
question at Dangopusi Railway Station situated at a distance of 30 K.M. from
the forwarding station.      The aforesaid weighment was conducted by the
Railway authority without issuing any notice to the respondent Company.
</p><p id="p_7">      As February14 and 15, 2009, were holidays being Saturday and
Sunday respectively, the respondent Company submitted a representation on
February 16, 2009, to the appellant no.2, the Chief Commercial Manager,
South Eastern Railway, for re-weighment of the consignment in question in
wagon- load     before unloading the same at           Paradip   Port. The above
representation contained that the respondent Company had to pay the
aforesaid punitive charges under compulsion which should be treated as a
payment on protest.
</p><p id="p_8">       On February 16, 2009, the rake in question was unloaded at the
destination point at Paradip Port. The prayer of the respondent Company for
further weighment of the consignment in wagon-load was not allowed.
</p><p id="p_9">      The learned Single Judge while setting aside the demand of the punitive
charges, observed that the appellant authority failed to maintain procedural
fairness in the light of the provisions of <a href="/doc/273330/" id="a_1">Sections 65</a> and <a href="/doc/1040779/" id="a_2">79</a> of the Railways
Act, 1989 (hereinafter referred to as the said Act, 1989) read with paragraphs
1422, 1423, 1424 and 1745 of the Indian Railways Commercial Manual
(hereinafter referred to as the IRCM).
</p><p id="p_10">      It is submitted by Mr. Ashok Kumar Chakraborty, learned Senior
Advocate, appearing on behalf of the appellants, at the very outset that the
writ application was not maintainable on the grounds of availability of
efficacious alternative remedy and lack of territorial jurisdiction. According to
him, the Railway Claim Tribunal was the appropriate forum for adjudicating
the claim of the appellant. Further, the events relating to booking of railway
wagon, weighment of consignment in wagon-load and payment of punitive
charges took place within the territorial jurisdiction of the State of Orissa.
</p><p id="p_11">      It is further submitted by Mr. Chakraborty that weighment of
consignment in wagon-load at Dangaposi Railway Station was permissible in
the light of the provisions of <a href="/doc/1379524/" id="a_3">Section 73</a>, <a href="/doc/1022405/" id="a_4">2nd</a> proviso to <a href="/doc/1040779/" id="a_5">Section 79</a> of the said
Act, 1989 read with paragraph 1744 (c) (4) and 1745 of the IRCM in view of
the congestion in the yard at Barajamda Railway Station.
</p><p id="p_12">      According to Mr. Chakraborty, the representation was submitted by the
respondent Company to the respondent No.2 on February 16, 2009, praying
for re-weighment of the consignment in wagon-load lodging protest against
issuing of railway receipt claiming punitive charges after the iron ore fines
had been unloaded at the destination point at Paradip Port on that date.
According to him, such failure constituted conscious relinquishment of the
right of re-weighment on the part of the respondent Company.
</p><p id="p_13">      Reliance is placed by Mr. Chakraborty on the decision of <a href="/doc/899076/" id="a_6">Union of
India vs. Biswanath Agarwal</a>, reported in 2015 (2) CHN (CAL) 156 in
support of his submissions.
</p><p id="p_14">       It is submitted by Mr. Rabilal Moitra, learned Senior Advocate,
appearing on behalf of the respondents, that the learned Single Judge was
pleased to entertain the writ application considering the fact of violation of
principles of natural justice as also denial of the right of re-weighment of
consignment in wagon-load as provided in <a href="/doc/1040779/" id="a_7">Section 79</a> of the said Act, 1989
read with paragraphs 1745 of the IRCM.                It is further submitted by Mr.
Moitra that the entire cause of action had been taken place within the
territorial jurisdiction of the South Eastern Railway and in accordance with
the provision of paragraph 1744 (b) of IRCM, the representation was
submitted to the respondent No.2 having his office within the territorial
jurisdiction of this High Court.
</p><p id="p_15">      It is submitted by him, with reference to the pleading made in the writ
application and the averments made in the affidavit-in-opposition filed
thereto that the fact of submission of representation for re-weighment of the
consignment in wagon- load on protest before unloading of the rake was not
in dispute.
</p><p id="p_16">      Reliance is placed by Mr. Moitra on the decision of Dwarka Nath Vs.
Bihar State reported in AIR 1959 SC 249 in support of his submissions.
</p><p id="p_17">      We have heard the learned Counsels appearing for the respective
parties and we have also carefully considered the facts and circumstances of
this case.
</p><p id="p_18">      At the very outset the preliminary objection of the appellants with
regard to the maintainability of the writ application is taken up for
consideration. In Harbanslal Sahnia Vs. Indian Oil Corporation Ltd.,
reported in (2003) 2 SC 107, principle of law relating to maintainability of
writ petition in spite of availability of alternative remedy was observed as
follows:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">                   "7. So far as the view taken by the High Court that the remedy by
              way of recourse to arbitration clause was available to the appellants and
              therefore the writ petition filed by the appellants was liable to be
              dismissed is concerned, suffice it to observe that the rule of exclusion of
              writ jurisdiction by availability of an alternative remedy is a rule of
              discretion and not one of compulsion. In an appropriate case, in spite of
              availability of the alternative remedy, the High Court may still exercise its
              writ jurisdiction in at least three contingencies: (i) where the writ petition
            seeks enforcement of any of the fundamental rights; (ii) where there is
           failure of principles of natural justice; or (iii) where the orders or
           proceedings are wholly without jurisdiction or the vires of an Act is
           challenged. .... .... ...."
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">      The present case attracts applicability of the first two contingencies.</blockquote>
<p id="p_19">      Regarding the next ground of territorial jurisdiction of this High Court
to entertain the writ petition, it was not in dispute that the originating railway
station, namely Barjamda Railway Station , the Railway Station in which the
weighment of the consignment in question was conducted, namely Dangaposi
Railway Station as also the office of the respondent No. 2, in which the
respondent Company submitted the representation, were situated within the
territorial jurisdiction of this High Court. Therefore, the cause of action arose
in part within the territorial jurisdiction of this High Court. We do not find
any error in the decision of the Learned Single Judge in entertaining the writ
petition in view of the above observations.
</p><p id="p_20">       In order to consider the grievances of the appellants with regard to the
decision making process of the learned Single Judge, the following provisions
of the said Act, 1989 are to be taken into consideration:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">                "65. Railway receipt.- (1) A railway administration shall,-
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">                (a) in a case where the goods are to be loaded by a person
           entrusting such goods, on the completion of such loading; or

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">                (b) in any other case, on the acceptance of the goods by it, issue a
           railway receipt in such form as may be specified by the Central
           Government.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">                (2) A railway receipt shall be prima facie evidence of the weight
           and the number of packages stated therein:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_7">                 Provided that in the case of a consignment in wagon-load or train-
           load and the weight or the number of packages is not checked by a
           railway servant authorised in this behalf, and a statement to that
           effect is recorded in such railway receipt by him, the burden of proving
           the weight or, as the case may be, the number of packages stated
           therein, shall lie on the consignor, the consignee or the endorsee."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_8">                "72. Maximum carrying capacity for wagons and trucks.-
                (1) The gross weight of every wagon or truck bearing on the axles
           when the wagon or truck is loaded to its maximum carrying capacity shall
           not exceed such limit as may be fixed by the Central Government for the
           class of axle under the wagon or truck.</blockquote>
<p id="p_21">       (2) Subject to the limit fixed under sub-section (1), every railway
administration shall determine the normal carrying capacity for every
wagon or truck in its possession and shall exhibit in words and figures the
normal carrying capacity so determined in a conspicuous manner on the
outside of every such wagon or truck.
</p><p id="p_22">      (3) Every person owning a wagon or truck which passes over a
railway shall determine and exhibit the normal carrying capacity for the
wagon or truck in the manner specified in sub- section (2).
</p><p id="p_23">      (4) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (2) or sub-
section (3), where a railway administration considers it necessary or
expedient so to do in respect of any wagon or truck carrying any specified
class of goods or any class of wagons or trucks of any specified type, it
may vary the normal carrying capacity for such wagon or truck or such
class of wagons or trucks and subject to such conditions as it may think fit
to impose, determine for the wagon or truck or class of wagons or trucks
such carrying capacity as may be specified in the notification and it shall
not be necessary to exhibit the words and figures representing the
carrying capacity so determined on the outside of such wagon or truck or
such class of wagons or trucks."
</p>
<p id="p_24">      "73. Punitive charge for overloading a wagon.-Where a person
loads goods in a wagon beyond its permissible carrying capacity as
exhibited under sub-section (2) or sub-section (3), or notified under sub-
section (4), of <a href="/doc/1543164/" id="a_8">section 72</a>, a railway administration may, in addition to the
freight and other charges, recover from the consignor, the consignee or the
endorsee, as the case may be, charges by way of penalty at such rates, as
may be prescribed, before the delivery of the goods:
</p><p id="p_25">      Provided that it shall be lawful for the railway administration to
unload the goods loaded beyond the capacity of the wagon, if detected at
the forwarding station or at any place before the destination station and to
recover the cost of such unloading and any charge for the detention of any
wagon on this account."
</p>
<p id="p_26">     "78. Power to measure, weigh, etc.-Notwithstanding anything
contained in the railway receipt, the railway administration may, before
the delivery of the consignment, have the right to-
</p>     (i) re-measure, re-weigh or re-classify any consignment;

<p id="p_27">     (ii) re-calculate the freight and other charges; and

</p><p id="p_28">     (iii) correct any other error or collect any amount that may have
been omitted to be charged."
</p><p id="p_29">      "79. Weighment of consignment on request of the consignee or
endorsee.- A railway administration may, on the request made by the
consignee or endorsee, allow weighment of the consignment subject to
such conditions and on payment of such charges as may be prescribed
and the demurrage charges if any:
</p><p id="p_30">      Provided that except in cases where a railway servant authorised in
this behalf considers it necessary so to do, no weighment shall be allowed
of goods booked at owner's risk rate or goods which are perishable and
are likely to lose weight in transit:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_9">                Provided further that no request for weighment of consignment in
          wagon-load or train-load shall be allowed if the weighment is not feasible
          due to congestion in the yard or such other circumstances as may be
          prescribed."</blockquote>

<p id="p_31">      The provisions of paragraphs 1744 and 1745 of IRCM are also taken
into consideration for the same reason and those are quoted below:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_10">                "1744. Reweighment at the request of owners.-(a) As laid down
          in the I.R.C.A. Goods Tariffs, railways do not undertake to weigh
          consignments at the destination station as a matter of course. Such
          weighments can only be considered in exceptional cases, when the
          condition of the consignment or package warrants this.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_11">                (b) Requests for such reweighments of goods booked in wagon loads
          should be referred to the Divisional Commercial Superintendent, who may
          permit the reweighment at his discretion provided that facilities for
          reweighment exist at the destination.

          quantity of goods entrusted for carriage, make a request in writing to the
          Divisional Commercial superintendent or any other railway servant
          authorised in this behalf for the weighment of such consignment at
          destination station such Railway Servant may allow request for
          weighment on a Railway Weigh bridge on payment of charges prescribed
          and demurrage charge if any, such request may be disallowed in the

<p id="p_32">      It would be profitable in the light of the facts and circumstances
involved in this case to take care of the effect of conjoint reading of the
provisions of <a href="/doc/273330/" id="a_11">Sections 65</a>, <a href="/doc/1543164/" id="a_12">72</a> (4), 73, 78 and 79 of the said Act, 1989 and
 paragraph 1744 of IRCM. The provisions of proviso to <a href="/doc/273330/" id="a_13">Section 65</a> permits the
railway authority to issue railway receipt in respect of a consignment
accepting the declaration of weight or measurement of the consignor or
consignee or endorse, as the case may be, under certain circumstances. A
power is given to the railway authority under sub-section (4) of <a href="/doc/1543164/" id="a_14">Section 72</a> to
take appropriate steps for the purpose of safety in case the weight or
measurement of the consignment in wagon-load exceeds the maximum
capacity which includes recovery of punitive charges under <a href="/doc/1379524/" id="a_15">Section 73</a>. For
such recovery, <a href="/doc/1398114/" id="a_16">Section 78</a> confers a right upon the railway authority to re-
measure, re-weigh or re-classify any consignment in order to re-calculate the
freight and other charges. The provisions of <a href="/doc/1040779/" id="a_17">Section 79</a> permits railway
authority either to allow re-weighment of a consignment at the request of a
consignee or endorsee on payment of such charges as may be prescribed and
the demurrage charges, if any, or to reject such prayer on the grounds
provided in two provisos of that Section read with the contingencies provided
in sub-paragraph (c) of paragraph 1744 of the IRCM. Further, a statutory
power is given to the railway authority under the above provisions for
weighment or measurement of a consignment in wagon-load in case of
loading in excess of maximum carrying capacity but at the same time a
protection is given under the above provision to the consignor or consignee or
endorsee, as the case may be, by way of re-weighment or re-measurement of
such consignment in their presence on the basis of their request.
</p><p id="p_33">      In Union of India Vs. Biswanath Agarwal, reported in 2015 (2) CHN
(CAL) 156, a Larger Bench of this Court, while interpreting the provisions of
<a href="/doc/1398114/" id="a_18">Section 78</a> of the said Act, 1989, observed that the expressions "re-measure",
"re-weigh", "re-classify", "re-calculate" and "correct any other error" appearing
in the above Section gives an indication of the exercise to be undertaken in
terms of such provision to be a repetition of the same exercise undertaken
earlier, the true sense of duplication that the above expression convey has to
be understood in the light of the particulars as to measurement or weight or
classification or calculation as "contained in the railway receipt".
</p><p id="p_34">       It has further been observed in Biswanath Agarwal (supra), that the
operation of <a href="/doc/1040779/" id="a_19">Section 79</a> of the said Act, 1989, is not confined to situations
where a demand for additional freight is made in respect of a consignment or
a demand on account of additional freight and consequential penalty is made
for overloading a wagon. The right to make a request for weighment (including
re-weighment) in myriad other circumstances. But the exercise of the right
under this Section is subject to several conditions.          A weighment or re-
weighment under this Section cannot be obtained for the mere asking. Just
as the discretion which is to be exercised by the railway official under this
Section has to be within the bounds of reasonableness as is expected of a
state or authority answering to this discretion in <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_20">Article 12</a> of the
Constitution, good grounds need to be made out by a consignee or endorsee,
as the case may be for seeking weighment or re-weighment of a consignment.
</p><p id="p_35">      It will not be out of context to mention that while interpreting the
different provisions of the said Act 1979, in Biswanath Agarwal (supra), the
above larger Bench of this Court further observed as follows:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_15">                "15. Before the substantial issue of procedural fairness and natural
          justice as evident from the questions referred to the Full Bench is taken up
          by assessing the relevant provisions of the 1989 Act, a caveat may be
          entered that every legal issue that falls for adjudication has to be founded
          on certain facts. Indeed, the terms of reference or the questions posed for
          consideration in a reference would indicate the facts on which the legal
          issue arises and, in course of the reference, the questions posed have only
          to be answered. But if the questions referred are not founded on facts
          which are evident therefrom, the applicability of the answers to the lis has
          to be assessed when the matter goes down for final adjudication after the
          reference is concluded. The respondent herein has not been able to show
          that any request for reweighment had been made by him prior to obtaining
          delivery of the consignment. There is no doubt that such aspect of the
          matter will engage the attention of the appropriate Division Bench while
          adjudicating the matter before it and considering whether the answers to
          the questions posed in the reference would be of any relevance in the state
          of the facts."</blockquote>
<p id="p_36">          (Emphasis supplied)

      Now, the questions that fall for determination before us are, whether
the decision making process of the Learned Single Judge with regard to
submission of the representation by the respondent Company for re-
weighment of the consignment in question in wagon-load on protest before
unloading of the same arbitrariness in the action of the appellant railway
 authority are sustainable in the light of the provisions of the said Act, 1989
raid with those of IRCM?
</p><p id="p_37">      Admittedly, on February 12, 2009, the appellant authority failed to
undertake weighment of the consignment in question in wagon-load at
Barajamda Railway Station due to congestion. So, there was no fault or
laches on the part of the respondent Company in the matter of loading of the
iron ore fine on the basis of its declaration of the weighment. It was also not
in dispute that on the next date, i.e. on February 13, 2009, the weighment of
the consignment in question in wagon-load was undertaken by the appellant
authority at Dangoposi Railway Station situated at a distance of 30 K.M. from
the forwarding station in absence of the respondent Company and/or without
even service of any notice on it. The submission of a representation by the
respondent Company in the office of the appellant No.2 on February 16,
2009, with a prayer for re-weighment of the consignment in wagon-load on
protest, was also not disputed by the appellants.
</p><p id="p_38">      In reply to the statement made in paragraph 16 of the writ petition that
the appellants unloaded the rake in question at Paradip Port on February 16,
2009 at late hours without paying any heed to its representation which had
been submitted before the appellant No.2 on the same date, it was stated in
paragraph 13 of the affidavit-in-opposition thereto that the appellant No.2
being the Chief Commercial Manager, South Eastern Railway, had no role to
play in this regard since the rake in question had been arrived at Paradip Port
situated under the jurisdiction of the East Cost Railway. Necessary to point
out that the above affidavit-in-opposition was affirmed by the Chief
Commercial Manager (FS &amp; FM), South Eastern Railway himself.
</p><p id="p_39">      In view of the provisions of sub-paragraphs (b) and (c) of paragraph
1744 of IRCM, the appellant no. 2 was the appropriate authority to deal with
the representation of the respondent Company. Undisputedly, the office of the
respondent No. 2 was closed on February 14 and 15, 2009, those days being
Saturday and Sunday respectively. So, there was no laches on the part of the
respondent Company to submit the representation without any delay.
Therefore it leads us to irresistible conclusion that the respondent No.2 not
 only failed or neglected to take steps on the basis of the above representation
due to misconception, but also his attempt to dispute the submission of
representation by the respondent Company before unloading of the rake at
Paradip Port on February 16, 2009, was not acceptable in its face value. The
respondent company had to pay the punitive charges before forced unloading
of the rake in question at Paradip Port even after submitting representation
before the appellant No.2 prior thereto.
</p><p id="p_40">         The above conduct of the appellant No.2 was violative of the provisions
of <a href="/doc/1040779/" id="a_21">Section 79</a> of the said Act, 1989 read with paragraph 1744 of IRCM as also
failure on the part of the appellants to ensure fair play, which is a fact of the
principles of natural justice, to the respondent Company.
</p><p id="p_41">         The decision of Biswanath Agarwal (supra) does not help the appellant
in view of the fact and circumstances involved n the present case.
</p><p id="p_42">         At the end of the day, we are of the opinion that the impugned
judgement does not require our interference.
</p><p id="p_43">         The appeal bearing APO No.154 of 2014 stands dismissed. The appeal
bearing APO No.139 of 2014 stands disposed of without passing any further
order.
</p><p id="p_44">         Since the time specified in the order impugned for refund of punitive
charges has already expired, the appellant authority is directed to refund the
above charges within two months.
</p><p id="p_45">         There will be, however, no order as to costs.
</p><p id="p_46">         Urgent photostat certified copy of this judgment, if applied for, be given
to the parties, on priority basis.
