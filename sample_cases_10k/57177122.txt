                             *-*-*-*-*-*-*
      THIS APPEAL IS FILED UNDER SECTION 173(1) OF MOTOR
VEHICLES ACT, AGAINST THE JUDGMENT AND AWARD DATED
16.06.2011 PASSED IN MVC NO.180/2009 ON THE FILE OF THE
SENIOR    CIVIL   JUDGE    &amp;   CJM,  ADDITIONAL     MACT,
CHITRADURGA, PARTLY ALLOWING THE CLAIM PETITION FOR
COMPENSATION AND SEEKING ENHANCEMENT OF SAME.

    THIS APPEAL COMING ON FOR ORDERS THIS DAY, THE
COURT DELIVERED THE FOLLOWING:

                        JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">       Claimants in MVC No.180/2009 on the file of MACT,

Chitradurga,    have   come        up   in   this    appeal,     seeking

enhancement of compensation.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">2.     This appeal is filed with inordinate delay of 201 days.

Hence    an    application    in   I.A.3/2012       is   filed   seeking

condonation of the same.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                   3</span><p id="p_4">




</p><p id="p_5">3.      Heard the counsel for appellant on I.A.3/2012 filed

seeking condonation of delay of 201 days in filing the appeal

and I.A.4/2012 filed seeking permission to prosecute the

appeal.    Perused the affidavits filed in support thereof.      On

going     through   the   same,   it   is   seen   that   the   legal

representatives     of    Mahalingappa,      claimant     in    MVC

No.180/2009 on the file of MACT, Chitradurga, have come up

in this appeal impugning the Judgment and Award dated

16.06.2011 passed therein.        Admittedly the claim petition

filed by Mahalingappa is in respect of injuries suffered by him

in a road traffic accident which is stated to have taken place

on 06.09.2008 at about 9.15 p.m., involving Motor Cycle

bearing No.KA-16/R-5544.
</p>
<p id="p_6">4.      In the proceedings before the Tribunal, claim petition

was allowed in part awarding compensation of Rs.81,900/- to

the said Mahalingappa for the injuries suffered in the said

accident. It is stated that subsequent to claim petition being

disposed of, Mahalingappa died on 16.08.2011.             Hence the

present appeal is filed with an application seeking permission
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                  4</span>




to prosecute the appeal and in the meanwhile a delay of 201

days is caused in filing the appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_7">5.     Heard the counsel for appellants on I.A.1/2012 filed

seeking condonation of delay of 201 days in filing the appeal.

Perused the affidavit filed in support thereof.              On going

through the same, it is seen that the appeal is not

maintainable for more than one reason.             First thing is that

the accident has taken place on 06.09.2008, there is nothing

on   record   to   demonstrate       that   the    death   is    directly

attributable to the injuries suffered in the accident, which is

of the year 2008. In that view of the matter, filing of appeal

by the legal representatives stating that they are entitled to

compensation for the injuries suffered by their father, does

not arise.    Even otherwise, the delay is also not properly

explained. In that view of the matter appeals filed by the legal

representatives     of   Mahalingappa             does     not     merit

consideration. Hence the same is dismissed.
