         THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH

                         Cr.A. No.2475/2019

              Shri Vikas Yadav, learned Public Prosecutor for the
respondent/State.
                                 ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">                          (Passed on 15 /04/2019)

              This criminal appeal under Section 374 of the Code of
Criminal Procedure, 1973 (for short "The Code") is preferred against the
judgment dated 24/11/2016 passed by IInd Additional Judge, Sendhwa,
District Barwani in S.T. No. 48/2014, whereby the appellant has been
convicted for offence punishable under Section 395/397 of the IPC and
sentenced to undergo 10 years R.I with a fine of Rs.500/-and in default of
payment of fine amount to further undergo 1 years R.I.
</p><p id="p_2">02.           As per prosecution story, on 07/09/2013, complainant-Akshay
David, his wife-Ruchi, friend-Jaypal Singh and his wife Nikki were going
from Indore to Mumbai by car bearing registration No. MP-04-GG-5843.
At about 1:15 a.m., they were passing from village Nawalpura, at that time
their car got punctured. When they were changing the Tyre of the car,
three-four     persons came there and they robbed, ATM Card, driving
license, Rs.5,000/- cash, two Samsung mobiles, one silver ring, ear rings
and Mangalsutra and thereafter, they fled away from the spot. The matter
was reported to the Police-Station-Varla, District-Barwani. On the basis of
which FIR bearing Crime No. 295/2013 was registered against the
appellant for offence punishable under <a href="/doc/1119707/" id="a_2">Section 395</a>/<a href="/doc/1865117/" id="a_3">397</a> of the IPC. During
investigation police arrested the appellant and other co-accused persons
and recovered robbed properties on the basis of their disclosure statement
recorded under <a href="/doc/1312051/" id="a_4">Section 27</a> of the Indian Evidence Act. After completion of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1"> Cr.A. No.2475/2019                                                 2</span>


investigation charge-sheet was filed before Court of Judicial Magistrate
First Class, Barwani, who committed the case to the Sessions Court and
ultimately, it was transferred to IInd Additional Sessions Judge,
Barwani.
</p><p id="p_3">03.    Learned Additional Sessions Judge, farmed charge for offence
under <a href="/doc/1119707/" id="a_5">Section 395</a>/<a href="/doc/1865117/" id="a_6">397</a> of the IPC against the appellant, he abjured his guilt
and took a plea that he has been falsely implicated in the mater. During
trial, the prosecution examined as many as 16 witnesses and has exhibited
40 documents in order to bring home the charges against the
appellant/accused. Trial Court, on appreciation of the evidence adduced by
the parties, pronounced the judgment on 24/11/2016 and concluded that the
appellant is liable to be convicted for commission of offence and sentenced
him as stated herein-above, hence this appeal.
</p><p id="p_4">04.          The learned counsel for the appellant has submitted that he is
not challenging the conviction for offence under <a href="/doc/1119707/" id="a_7">Section 395</a>/<a href="/doc/1865117/" id="a_8">397</a> of the
IPC passed by the trial Court, however, the appellant is the first offender
and after the conviction and sentence passed by the trial Court, he is in
custody and has already served       more than 5 years of jail sentence,
therefore, he prayed that the sentence passed by the trial Court may be
reduced suitably and the fine amount can be enhanced reasonably.
</p><p id="p_5">05.          Per contra, learned Public Prosecutor has submitted that the
sentence awarded by the trial Court to the appellant on his conviction under
Section 395/397 of the IPC does not deserve any leniency from this Court
as he has failed to make out any case for modification of the sentence
awarded to him
</p><p id="p_6">06.          Having heard learned counsel for the parties and on perusal of
entire record of the case, I am inclined to allow this appeal in part upon
finding some force in the submissions made by the learned counsel for the
appellant.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">         Cr.A. No.2475/2019                                                  3</span>


<p id="p_7">        07.            Though the appellant has not made any attempt to assail the
        finding of his conviction on merits, yet with a view to satisfy myself as to
        whether the findings of the Court below of conviction is legally sustainable
        or not, I perused the record and especially therein having so perused, I am
        satisfied that no case is made out to interfere in the findings of the Court
        below. It is well proved from the statement of complainant-Akshay David
        (P.W.3), Ruchi David (P.W.4), Jaypal Singh Parmar (PW 9) and Smt.
        Nikki (P.W.10) I, therefore, upheld the findings of conviction under
        <a href="/doc/1119707/" id="a_9">Section 395</a>/<a href="/doc/1865117/" id="a_10">397</a> of the IPC recorded by the trial Court.
</p>
<p id="p_8">        08.            Now the question arises as to whether the appellant's sentence
        should be reduced and if so, to what extent as urged by the learned counsel
        for the appellant. As per record the appellant is not having any criminal
        antecedents. He has already served more than 5 years of jail sentence.
        Under these circumstances this Court is of the considered opinion that the
        ends of justice would be met if the sentence of the appellant is reduced
        from 10 years R.I to 7 years of R.I for the offence punishable under <a href="/doc/1119707/" id="a_11">Section
        395</a>/<a href="/doc/1865117/" id="a_12">397</a> of the IPC and the fine amount is enhanced from Rs.500/- to
        Rs.5,000/-. In default of payment of enhanced fine amount, the appellant
        shall suffer further 1 year R.I.
</p>
<p id="p_9">        09.            Resultantly, the appeal succeeds and is allowed in part to the
        extent the impugned judgment and order has been modified. The appellant
        is in jail, the Registry of this Court is directed to arrange for issuance of
        supersession warrant against appellant -Parasram @ Parasiya. A copy of
        the judgment be sent to the trial Court along with record for information
        and compliance.
