JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">Present: Ld. APP for the state.
</p><p id="p_2">        Accused with Ld. Defence Counsel.  
</p>
<p id="p_3">1.       Brief facts of the case as alleged by prosecution are that on 21.07.2008 at 

about   8.40   pm   at   Najafgarh   Nangloi   Road   Near   Udaseen   Ashram     within 

jurisdiction of PS Najafgarh accused Kapil Kumar ( hereinafter called accused ) 

was   driving   motorcycle   bearing   no.   HR   13   B   7258   in   a   rash   and   neglignent 

manner so as to endanger human life and personal safety of ofthers and while 

driving the aforesaid vehicle in the aforesaid manner accused hit and caused 

simple injury to one Mr. Mohan son of Sh. Bhuran and thereby accused was 

booked for the offence u/s 279/337 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_4">IPC</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_4">    

</p><p id="p_5">2.       On appearance of the accused copies of documents were supplied to  the 

accused.   
</p>
<p id="p_6">

</p><p id="p_7">3.       Notice was framed  against the accused for committing offence punishable 

under  <a href="/doc/1270101/" id="a_5">section 279</a>/<a href="/doc/1402213/" id="a_6">337</a>  IPC, to  which  accused pleaded  not guilty and  claimed 

trial.    
</p>
<p id="p_8">

</p><p id="p_9">4.       Prosecution in his evidence has examined  none of the witnesses.  As the 

main injured PW足 Mohan was not traceable even after service through DCP and 

all the other witnesses are formal witnesses, therefore no purpose would have 




FIR no. 404/08, PS Najafgarh                                           State vs. Kapil Kumar @ Kamal
                                             Page 3/4

been served in examination of all the other formal witnesses.  Therefore, P E was 

closed.  Accused admitted FIR u/s 294 Cr. P C.
</p>
<p id="p_10">5.      Statement   of   accused   recorded   under   <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_7">section   313Cr</a>.P.C.   and   all 

incriminating circumstances appearing in evidence were put to  him and accused 

denied   all   the   incriminating     circumstances.     Accused   did   not   prefer   to   lead 

defence evidence.       
</p>
<p id="p_11">

</p><p id="p_12">5. Discussion:足

        As the main injured Mr. Manoj is untraceable in the matter even through 

DCP/SHO   and   all   the   other   witnesses   are   formal   witnesses,   therefore   in   the 

absence   of   testimony   of   PW足   Mohan   it   can   not   be   ascertained   that   accused 

caused the said accident. Statement of IO recorded separately in this regard who 

submitted that witness was tenant at the given address and has left the address. 

</p><p id="p_13">        Rash act is a act  which is done in a risky manner with hope that it will not 

cause harm to some still not  taking precautions and which is done indifferent to 

its consequences and because of callous attitude.   While negligence on other 

hand is the non足fulfillment of one's duty towards the others.  In both rashness and 

negligent mental element of recklessness is involved.                 

</p><p id="p_14">        To prove an offence under <a href="/doc/1270101/" id="a_8">section 279</a>/<a href="/doc/1402213/" id="a_9">337</a> IPC it has to be proved that 

accused   was   driving   offending   vehicle,   accident   was   caused   by   offending 

vehicle, accused was driving offending vehicle in rash or negligent way, accident 

was caused by rash or negligent driving of the accused but in the case in hand 

prosecution   even   has   not   established   first   ingredient   means   prosecution   has 


FIR no. 404/08, PS Najafgarh                                           State vs. Kapil Kumar @ Kamal
                                            Page 4/4

failed to establish that accused was driving the offending vehicle on the day of 

the   incident   and   accident   was   caused   by   such   vehicle.   Therefore,   there   is 

nothing on record to show that accused was driving the offending vehicle and 

accident was caused by rash or negligent driving on the part of the accused.   

Final Verdict:足  

                 It is the duty of prosecution to prove the guilt of accused beyond 

reasonable   doubt  which  prosecution   has  failed   to   prove.     Therefore,   accused 

persons are acquitted of the offence u/s  279/337 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_10">IPC</a>.
