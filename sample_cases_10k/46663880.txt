</pre>


<p id="p_1">1.         This is an appeal arising out of an impugned
order and decree dated 18.02.2019, whereby the suit of
the plaintiff/respondent was decreed. For avoidance of in-
convenience,      parties   shall   be   referred   to   by    their
nomenclature as in the main suit.

                                                         Page no. 1/7
</p><p id="p_3"> 2.         Brief facts of the case as per the plaintiff are
that he is a Sr. Citizen and a retired Bank official. That the
property bearing no. K-71, West Patel Nagar, along with
terrace rights of K-72 was gifted to him by virtue of
registered gift deed dated 26.09.2000 and thereafter, the
portion bearing no. K-72, Second Floor (backside) was
constructed by the plaintiff.     That the plaintiff is the
exclusive owner in possession of the portion occupied by

decease like BP and acute Diabetes. That the defendant

the marriage of the defendants, the plaintiff permitted
them to live in the portion of the second floor of his
property no. K-72 (back side) West Patel Nagar, New Delhi.
That the family of the defendant no. 1 frequently used to
come to the house of the plaintiff and used to fight with
them on petty issues. That in April 2017, the defendant
no. 1 started harassing the plaintiff regularly. That most of
the times, the defendant no. 1 is living with her parents.
That the plaintiff by way of legal notice dated 01.11.2017
terminated the licence of the defendant no. 1 but has
failed to hand over the vacant peaceful possession.
</p>



<p id="p_4">RCA No. 11/19
Ankita Chadha vs Rajesh Sethi
                                                   Page no. 2/7
</p><p id="p_5"> 3.         In the written statement, it is pleaded by the
defendant no. 1 that the suit is filed just to harass her and
with ulterior motives. It is also pleaded that the plaintiff
has concocted a false story just to put pressure upon her.
That the plaintiff has approached the Court with clean
hands and also has concealed the material facts. That it is
the defendant no. 1 herself, who has been facing torture
and mental agony at the hands of the plaintiff and his
family members and decided to file a domestic violence
petition besides a complaint under Section 125 Cr.P.C.
</p>

<p id="p_6">4.         After the filing of the written statement, an
application under Order 12 Rule 6 CPC was filed by the
plaintiff on 23.07.2018 and the same was allowed by Ld.
Trial Court vide order dated 18.02.2019 and the suit was
decreed.
</p>
<p id="p_7">5.         I have heard arguments and perused the record.
</p>

<p id="p_8">6.         The    defendant     no.   1   has   challenged   the
impugned judgment on the ground that there was no
admission on her part and that the facts needed to be
proved by leading evidence by the parties.
</p><p id="p_9">           In the case in hand, the plaintiff has prayed for a
decree of permanent and mandatory injunction. So, the
plaintiff was required to establish two things i.e. existence


RCA No. 11/19
Ankita Chadha vs Rajesh Sethi
                                                     Page no. 3/7
 of relationship of licensor and licencee and termination of
licence.
</p><p id="p_10">           Admittedly,     the   owner   of   the   property   in
question is the plaintiff, who is the father in law of the
defendant no. 1. In para no. 25 of the plaint, it is pleaded
by the plaintiff that by way of a legal notice dated
01.10.2017, he terminated the licence of the defendant
no. 1 and despite receipt of the same, she failed to hand
over the vacant and peaceful possession of the premises.
It is pertinent to mention here that in corresponding para
of her written statement, the defendant no. 1 did not
dispute nor denied the service of legal notice dated
01.10.2017. Hence, it is clear that there has been
revocation of the licence by the plaintiff. Moreover, after
the institution of the case, the licence of the defendant no.
1 stands terminated.
</p>

<p id="p_11">7.         It is also the plea taken by the defendant no. 1
that Ld. Trial Court has wrongly relied upon the judgment
of Hon'ble Apex Court i.e. <a href="/doc/594165/" id="a_1">S. R. Batra &amp; Anr., vs Taruna
Batra</a> (2007) 3 SCC 169.           It is also alleged by the
defendant no. 1 that the judgments are extinguishable on
facts and have been wrongly applied in the case.
</p>

<p id="p_12">8.         In para no. 4 of the appeal itself, it is pleaded by
the defendant no. 1 herself that it was the admitted case

RCA No. 11/19
Ankita Chadha vs Rajesh Sethi
                                                      Page no. 4/7
 that on insistence of defendant no. 1 (appellant herein), a
separate gas connection was taken in August, 2016 in the
kitchen of suit premises.
</p>

<p id="p_13">9.         The plaintiff and his wife are senior citizens.
This is also not disputed that the plaintiff is the owner of
the property in question. The defendant no. 1 did not join
her husband i.e. Sh. Vikram Sethi, in the present appeal,
who was the defendant no. 2 in the suit before Ld. Trial
Court for the reasons best known to her.              So, the
defendant no. 1 was residing at a different address from
her husband. It is pertinent to mention here that the
defendant no. 1 has disclosed two addresses in the written
statement itself and as per the affidavit which was filed
along with the present appeal, she has shown the similar
addresses as shown in the written statement.
</p><p id="p_14">           The     defendant    no.   1   has   disclosed   the
residential address of the plaintiff i.e. K-71, 72 and as per
the address disclosed by the plaintiff in the supporting
affidavit to the reply of the application under <a href="/doc/100581/" id="a_2">Section 5</a> of
Limitation Act as K-71, West Patel Nagar, New Delhi.
</p><p id="p_15">           Admittedly, the property i.e. K-72 (back side),
Second Floor is neither the property of the husband of the
defendant no. 1 nor it was taken on rent by him nor it was
property of joint family of which her husband i.e. Sh.
Vikram Sethi was a member.
</p>
<p id="p_16">RCA No. 11/19
Ankita Chadha vs Rajesh Sethi
                                                    Page no. 5/7
</p><p id="p_17"> 10.        It is the plea of the defendant no. 1 that she was
residing in a shared household.           For the sake of
arguments, if this argument of the defendant no. 1 is
presumed to be correct, it is the admitted case of the
defendant no. 1 herself that she was having separate gas
connection in the suit property i.e. K-72 (Back side),
Second Floor, West Patel Nagar, New Delhi since August,
2016 i.e. around one year of her marriage which took
place on 30.07.2015.        The defendant no. 1 herself has
shown the residential address of the respondent as K-71,
</p><p id="p_18">72. So, when both the parties are having two addresses
and even separate gas connection, the same cannot be
treated as shared household.         The defendant no. 1
residing on second address and the service was affected
upon second address itself. The house in question belongs
to the plaintiff, who is the father in law of the defendant
no. 1 and the same does not belong to the husband of the
defendant no. 1 i.e. Sh. Vikram Sethi. So, the defendant
no. 1 cannot claim any right to live in the property of her
father in law against his wishes when admittedly, her
husband was residing at some other addresses.
</p>

<p id="p_19">11.        In view of my aforesaid observations, I do not
find any infirmity or illegality in the impugned judgment.
Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.
