<p id="p_1">            This order will dispose of two identical writ petitions bearing

CWP No. 18469 of 2013 (M/s Dwarkadhis Buildwell Pvt. Ltd. v. Permanent

Lok Adalat (Public Utility Service), Rewari and others and CWP No.18470

of 2013 (M/s Dwarkadhis Buildwell Pvt. Ltd. v. Permanent Lok Adalat

reference, the facts are being culled out from CWP No.18469 of 2013.

                                                                 integrity of this document

            The present writ petition is directed against the order dated

31.5.2013 (Annexure P-9) passed by the learned Permanent Lok Adalat

(Public Utility Service) Rewari, whereby the application of respondents No.

2 and 3 was allowed directing the petitioner-builder company not to demand

any interest from the allottees as they have already made complete payment

and also because the petitioner has not delivered the possession of the plot

despite completion of construction.
</p>
<p id="p_3">            Respondents No. 2 and 3 booked a residential plot measuring

250 sq. yards with petitioner-builder company vide Annexure P-2. A letter

of allotment was issued vide Annexure P-3 dated 2.4.2007. The allottees-

respondents had been making payments to the petitioner-builder company

from time to time. However, as per the case of the petitioner, the allottees

defaulted in making the payments in time. When the petitioner-builder

company started charging interest for the alleged delayed payment from the

respondents-allottees, they approached the learned Permanent Lok Adalat

by way of an application under <a href="/doc/170507607/" id="a_1">Section 22-C</a> of the Legal Services

Authorities Act, 1987. Notice was issued and pursuant thereto, petitioner

appeared before the Permanent Lok Adalat. Conciliation proceedings failed

and thereafter the learned Permanent Lok Adalat proceeded to decide the

case on merits. The application of the allottees-respondents was allowed

vide impugned order dated 31.5.2013 (Annexure P-9) directing the

petitioner-builder company not to charge any interest from the allottees-

respondents and also issued other ancillary directions. Hence, this writ

petition.

<p id="p_4">            Learned counsel for the petitioner-builder company submits

that since the respondents-allottees failed to make the payment in time as
                                                                     Saluja Mukesh Kumar
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">CWP NO.18469 of 2013 and another                                        3</span>

                                                                    integrity of this document

per the schedule of payment, petitioner was entitled to charge interest from

the allottees. He further submits that since the learned Permanent Lok

Adalat proceeded on erroneous approach while not appreciating the true

facts of the case, the impugned order has resulted in miscarriage of justice

and was liable to be set aside. He prays for allowing the present writ

petition by setting aside the impugned award.
</p>
<p id="p_5">            Having heard the learned counsel for the petitioner at

considerable length, after careful perusal of the record of the case and

giving thoughtful consideration to the contentions raised, this Court is of the

considered opinion that these two writ petitions are misconceived and liable

to be dismissed. To say so, reasons are more than one, which are being

recorded hereinafter.
</p>
<p id="p_6">            It is an undisputed fact on record that the respondents-allottees

have already made the entire payment they were supposed to make. As per

the schedule of payment, the last payment was made by the allottees in the

month of Feb./March 2013. Nothing more is due against the allottees. It is

equally important to note that inspite of the completion of development

works, petitioner-builder company has not handed over the possession of

the plots to the respondents-allottees till date. The only excuse for not

handing over the possession is that petitioner-builder company applied for

completion certificate vide application dated 18.7.2012 (Annexure P-7)

submitted to the competent authority and the completion certificate is yet to

be issued in favour of the petitioner. Thus, it is an admitted position that

inspite of the making the entire payment of the plot allotted in their favour,

the allottees have not been handed over the possession of the plot. In this

view of the matter, it is unhesitatingly held that petitioner-builder company
                                                                   Saluja Mukesh Kumar
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">CWP NO.18469 of 2013 and another                                      4</span>
                                                                  2013.11.21 10:36
                                                                  I attest to the accuracy and
                                                                  integrity of this document

was not entitled to charge the respondents-allottees for interest because the

petitioner is not in a position to hand over the possession to the allottees.

Thus, learned Permanent Lok Adalat committed no error of law while

passing the impugned order and the same deserves to be upheld.

</p><p id="p_7">            It is also the case of the petitioner that it is not going to pay

interest to the allottees on account of delayed delivery of possession of the

plot. The allottees could have made only the payment to the petitioner-

builder company which they have already done.            So far getting of

completion certificate is concerned, it is between the concerned authorities

and the petitioner-builder company, wherein the allottees have no role to

play. If the delivery of possession is getting delayed because of the alleged

inaction on the part of the petitioner-company or the concerned authority or

both, bonafide allottee cannot be made to suffer.

</p><p id="p_8">            The contention raised on behalf of the petitioner that there was

no such clause in the agreement between the parties that in case of delayed

delivery of possession, petitioner-builder company would be bound to pay

interest to the allottees, cannot be accepted.      Petitioner seems to be

interested only in its money and not in the interest of the allottees for

delivering the possession of the plot within a reasonable time. Thus, the

present case can be said to be a case wherein petitioner is trying to proceed

on wholly unwarranted approach securing only its right and not caring about

its corresponding duties. Having said that, this Court feels no hesitation to

conclude that the learned Permanent Lok Adalat arrived at a judicious

conclusion while passing the impugned order and the same deserves to be

upheld.

             Considering the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case

noted above, coupled with the reasons aforementioned, this Court is of the

considered view that both the above-said writ petitions are misconceived,

bereft of merit and without any substance. Thus, these must fail. No case

for interference has been made out.
</p>
<p id="p_11">             Resultantly, both the above-said writ petitions stand dismissed,

however, with no order as to costs.
