(i) Brief statement of the reasons for the decision     :

</pre><p id="p_1">1. The prosecution story in brief is that all the accused on 21/04/01 at
  about 11.55 PM in front of Bharat Apartment, Patparganj Road,
  Mandawali intending to take dishonestly movable property i.e. cable
  wires out of the possession of Bharat Apartment without his consent
  moved that property in order to such taking and committed an offence
  punishable U/s 379 <a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_2">Section 34</a> IPC for        which   FIR   No.   119/01 was
  registered at P.S. Mandawali. After investigation charge sheet was
  filed against both the accused U/s 379/411/34 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_3">IPC</a>.
</p>

<p id="p_2">2. From the material on record a charge U/s 379/411 r.w. <a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_4">Section 34</a> IPC
  was framed against all the accused to which they pleaded not guilty
  and claimed trial.
</p>

<p id="p_3">3. To support its case the prosecution has examined only 01 witness.
</p>

<p id="p_4">4. PW1 Ct. Mukesh Kumar has deposed on oath that on 22/04/01 on
  receiving of DD no. 31A he alongwith ASI Inder Pal reached at Bharat
  Apartment, Patparganj road Mandawali where one Vikas Kumar
  Sharma met them and deposed that five persons came there and
  commit theft and ran away. PW1 has proved on record arrest memo of
  all the accused persons Ex.PW1/A to Ex.PW1/E and their personal
  search memos Ex.PW1/F to Ex.PW1/J. PW1 has also proved on record
  the seizure memo of cable wire Ex.PW1/K.
</p>

<p id="p_5">5. In his cross-examination PW1 admitted that Ex.PW1/D1 is his statement
  which was recorded by the I.O. PW1 further admitted that in the
  statement Ex.PW1/D1 he has not given any reference of arrival of the
  PCR Van at the spot. PW1 denied that the accused persons never
  made any confessional statement and the signatures were taken by
  the IO forcefully on some blank papers. PW1 further denied that no
  alleged recovery was effected at the instance of accused persons and
  alleged recovery has been planted on the accused persons by the
  police in collusion with the complainant. PW1 further denied that he is
   deposing falsely.
</p><p id="p_6">                                    :: 3 ::
</p><p id="p_7">6. No other witness was examined by the prosecution and the Prosecution
  evidence was closed.      Since there was no incriminating evidence
  coming on record the Statement of accused U/s 313 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_5">Cr.P.C</a>. was
  dispensed with and the matter was posted for final arguments.
</p>

<p id="p_8">7. I have heard the Ld. APP for State and counsel Ms. Neeta Goyal for all
  the accused persons and have perused the material on record.
</p>

<p id="p_9">8. In the present case the prosecution has to prove beyond reasonable
  doubt that all the accused on 21/04/01 at about 11.55 PM in front of
  Bharat Apartment, Patparganj Road, Mandawali pursuant to their
  common intention have committed theft of cable wires to prove the
  offence U/s 379 r.w. <a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_6">Section 34</a> IPC or in the alternative all the accused
  pursuant to their common intention have retained the cable wires
  having reason to believe the same to be a stolen property to prove the
  offence U/s 411 r.w. <a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_7">Section 34</a> IPC.
</p>

<p id="p_10">9. In the present case the FIR has been registered on the complaint of the
  complainant Sh. Vikas Kumar Sharma who is also the eye-witness in this
  case. PW Vikas Kumar Sharma has not been examined in this case as
  he was not traceable at the address mentioned in the list of witnesses.
  PW1 Ct. Mukesh Kumar who has been examined in this case is merely a
  formal witness and he has not seen the accused committing theft.
  Therefore, his evidence is of no help to the prosecution.      Since the
  material witness PW Vikas Kumar Sharma has not been examined by
  the prosecution a doubt has been created whether any such offence
  of theft by the accused took place on 21/04/01 or not, benefit of which
  has to go to the accused.
</p>

<p id="p_11">10.In the facts there being no incriminating evidence coming on record
  all the accused are acquitted U/s 379/411 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_8">IPC</a> r.w. <a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_9">Section 34</a> IPC. File
  be consigned to record room.
