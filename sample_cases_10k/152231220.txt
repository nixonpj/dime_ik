     THIS M.F.A. COMING ON FOR ADMISSION, THIS DAY,
THE COURT DELIVERED THE FOLLOWING:

                    JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">     This appeal is directed against the Judgment and

Order passed by the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal,

Bengaluru    [the   'Tribunal',   for    short]   in   MVC

No.5078/2011.
</p>
<p id="p_2">

</p><p id="p_3">     2.     The appellant has filed the claim petition

before the Tribunal seeking compensation for the

injuries sustained by him in the road traffic accident

which occurred on 6.8.2011 while crossing the road at

the pedestrian/zebra crossing owing to the actionable

negligence on the driver of the bus bearing registration

No.KA.01-FA-1439,     insured     with     the    Insurance

company- 2nd respondent herein. Due to the impact of

the accident, he having sustained grievous injuries was

shifted to Fortis hospital, Bangalore, thereafter shifted

to NIMHANS where he was treated as an inpatient from

6.8.2011 to 7.8.2011. Subsequently, he was shifted to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                  -3-</span>


Sreenivasa Hospital wherein he was admitted as an

inpatient from 7.8.2011 to 14.8.2011. It was contended

that he had incurred huge medical expenses and

accordingly, sought for the compensation. The insurer

resisted    the   claim.         Respondent        No.2-Insurance

Company entered appearance and contested the claim.

The Tribunal analyzing the evidence on record, awarded

total compensation of Rs.1,38,000/- with interest at the

rate of 6% p.a. from the date of petition till the date of

deposit.    Aggrieved by the same, the claimant is in

appeal     challenging     the   quantum      of    compensation

awarded as being inadequate as well as the contributory

negligence of 20% fixed on him.
</p>
<p id="p_4">

</p><p id="p_5">     3.      Learned counsel appearing for the appellant

placing reliance on Exs.P3 and P4, the sketch and spot

panchanama, respectively would contend that the

accident took place at the pedestrian/zebra crossing

due to the negligence of the driver of the bus. Ignoring
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                           -4-</span>


this vital aspect, the Tribunal fixed the contributory

negligence to the extent of 20% on the claimant. It was

further submitted that the insurer has not examined

the driver of the offending vehicle or any other witness

to rebut the evidence of the claimant.         In such

circumstances, it was obligatory on the part of the

Tribunal to fix the entire liability on the Insurance

company. Further, learned counsel submitted that the

quantum of compensation awarded by the Tribunal is

meager and disproportionate to the nature and gravity

of the injuries sustained by the claimant.    The same

requires to be enhanced substantially.



</p><p id="p_6">     4.    Per contra, learned counsel appearing     for

the respondent No.2-Insurance company justifying the

impugned Judgment and order submitted that the

claimant was crossing the road without taking due care

and caution. It is the duty of persons who are crossing

the road to be vigilant. Exs.P3 and P4 were considered
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                            -5-</span>


by the Tribunal in a right perspective to fix the

contributory negligence on the part of the claimant to

the extent of 20%. Further, it was submitted that the

quantum of compensation awarded by the Tribunal

being just and proper do not call for any interference by

this Court.
</p>
<p id="p_7">
</p><p id="p_8">     5.       Heard the learned Counsel for the parties

and perused the material on record.
</p>
<p id="p_9">

</p><p id="p_10">     6. Ex.P3 is the sketch drawn by the traffic police

which indicates the spot of the accident. Ex.P4 is the

panchanama. These two documents clearly establishes

that the accident occurred at the pedestrian crossing

and entirely due to the negligent driving of the driver of

the offending vehicle.     To ascertain the factum of

contributory negligence, first it has to be analyzed as

regards the aspect of negligence. As per the Law Lexicon

by P.Ramanath Aiyar, negligence means the absence of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                             -6-</span>


proper care, caution and diligence, of such care, caution

and diligence, as under the circumstances reasonable

and ordinary prudence would require to be exercised.

Contributory negligence means the act or omission

amounting to want of ordinary care on the part of the

complaining party which concurring with defendant's

negligence, is proximate cause of injury.             Thus,

negligence is the lack of care which a prudent person

would   have   taken   in   the   normal    circumstances.

Contributory   negligence   is    the   negligence   of   the

claimant contributing to the happening of the event i.e.

the accident in question.     Contributory negligence is

purely a question of fact which can be asserted from the

direct evidence in that regard. At this juncture, it would

be profitable to refer to the Charlesworth and Persy in

their book on negligence -7th Edition, wherein it is said

"it is the duty of the persons, who are driving over a

crossing for foot- passengers which is at the entrance of

the street, to drive slowly, cautiously and carefully; but
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                            -7-</span>


it is also the duty of the foot-passengers to use due care

and caution in going upon a crossing at the entrance of

the street, so as to not to get among the carriages, and

thus receive injury." It is the bounden duty of the driver

of a vehicle to have a good look out to know whether any

pedestrian is crossing on the road or for other traffic

which may be expected to be on the road. The case on

hand would clearly indicate that the claimant was

crossing on the pedestrian crossing. If a driver of the

vehicle had taken little care and caution, the accident

would have been averted.
</p>
<p id="p_11">
</p><p id="p_12">     7. However, the fact that the driver's failure to see

a pedestrian crossing the road cannot be lost sight of.

The evidence of the claimant is not rebutted by the

insurer by leading any evidence. The crucial evidence

would have been of the driver to discard the evidence of

the claimant. That having not been done by the insurer,

merely on assumptions and surmises the Tribunal
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                            -8-</span>


proceeded to attribute 20% negligence on the part of the

claimant which cannot be sustained.         This view is

fortified by the order of this Court in the case of

<a href="/doc/1810656/" id="a_1">A.Anandan V.Abdul Azeez and another</a> reported in

2004 ACJ 1091 wherein, this Court has held that the

evidence of the owner -cum-driver of the Motor cycle

was essential to attribute the contributory negligence on

the part of the claimant. In the circumstances, this

Court is of the opinion that negligence attributed to the

extent of 20% requires to be set aside and the entire

liability deserves to be fixed on the Insurance company.


</p><p id="p_13">     8. As regards the quantum of compensation it is

perspicuous that the accident occurred in the year

2011. The monthly income of the claimant requires to

be determined at Rs.6,000/- per month.       Accordingly,

the claimant shall be entitled to a sum of Rs.18,000/-

towards loss of earning during the laid up period.

Considering the hospitalization period of the claimant, it
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                            -9-</span>


would be just and proper to award a sum of Rs.2,000/-

towards diet, attendant and incidental charges. In all

other respects, the compensation awarded by the

Tribunal remains undisturbed.

<p id="p_14">

Tribunal is modified as under:
