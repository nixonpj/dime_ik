</pre><p id="p_1">                  By this petition, the petitioners/original defendants have
 challenged the order passed by the learned Civil Judge Senior
 Division, Ahmednagar, rejecting the application to set aside the No
 Written Statement order dated 14 November 2016.
</p>

<p id="p_2"> 2.               The petitioners/defendants were served on 11 August
 2016 and on 14 November 2016 'No WS' order came to be passed.
 The petitioners have stated that, the petitioners i.e. husband and wife
 are aged and one of them suffers from cancer. These averments have
 been made in the application so also there are assertions to that effect

 contested this petition neither has controverted any of the assertion.
</p>

<p id="p_4"> 4.               Considering the age of the petitioners and that the order
 of 'No Written Statement' was passed immediately within three
 months of the summons being served on the petitioners and that the
 respondents- plaintiffs have not appeared to contest the petition,
 indulgence needs to be extended in favour of the petitioners as
 respondents/plaintiffs have not demonstrated any prejudice.
</p>

<p id="p_5"> 5.               While issuing notice, this Court had directed the
 petitioners to deposit an amount of R 2,000/- in the trial Court, which

 as costs.
