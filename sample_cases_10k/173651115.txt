<pre id="pre_1">     THE HON'BLE SRI JUSTICE CHALLA KODANDA RAM

 WRIT PETITIONS No. 8790, 8835, 8919, 8924, 8939, 8940, 8954,
    8980, 8975, 9084, 9112, 9173, 9169, 9127, 9126 of 2019

COMMON ORDER:

      These Writ Petitions question the orders of the Telangana

State Election Commission, Hyderabad passed in exercise of the

powers conferred under the provisions of the Telangana Panchayat

Raj Act and the Rules made thereunder, disqualifying the

petitioners for a period of three years from the date of issue of the

said orders from contesting the elections to be held for any office

for their failure to lodge final accounts of election expenditure

within 45 days from the date of declaration of the results.

        Heard learned counsel for the petitioners and learned

Standing Counsel for Zilla Parishad / Mandal Parishad Officers.

        On 24.05.2019 and 25.04.2019, when all these matters

were taken up, due to paucity of time, this Court granted interim

suspension of the order impugned and directed them to be listed

today under the caption for orders. Hence, they are listed today.

         In the context of the challenge made in these Writ

Petitions, it is apt to note that when once the statute mandated the

authorities to take steps immediately or as soon as possible, the

same has to be complied with and that they cannot sleep over the

matters for years together and thereafter, seek to justify the delay

on their part.     Since the time for submission of election

expenditure is 45 days from the date of declaration of the results,

the respondent State Election Commission ought to have taken</pre>

<p id="p_1">action, if any, immediately thereafter or within a reasonable time.

</p><p id="p_2">       Now, it is brought to the notice of this Court by the learned

Standing Counsel Sri P. Sudheer Rao appearing for the State
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                    2</span>




Election Commission that the issue raised in these Writ Petitions is

squarely covered by the common order dated 20.03.2019 passed

by this Court in Writ Petition No.2630 of 2018 and batch, wherein

also, it is observed that 'the balance would tilt in favour of the

petitioners, given the lapses on the part of the election authorities in

giving effect to their statutory obligations and the orders of

disqualification visited upon the petitioners by the Commissioner are

accordingly, set aside'.
</p>
<p id="p_3">       Admittedly, in all these cases, elections were held in 2014

and the impugned orders were passed in 2017 i.e. nearly after

lapse of three years, disqualifying the petitioners from contesting

the elections for three years from the date of issue of the order,

which action cannot be countenanced. The respondent authorities

are under mandatory obligation to take action immediately or as

soon as possible, in accordance with the provisions of the Act.

</p><p id="p_4">       In view of the same and also in terms of the reasons stated

by this Court in the order dated 20.03.2019 in Writ Petition

No.2630 of 2018 and batch, these Writ Petitions are all allowed,

setting aside the impugned orders. No costs.

</p><p id="p_5">       As it would take some time for the copy of the order to be

made available to the petitioners by the Registry, learned counsel

for the petitioners shall be entitled to inform the Returning Officer

with respect to the orders of this Court, which shall be construed

as a communication for the purpose of implementation under the

provisions of the <a href="/doc/1396751/" id="a_1">Contempt of Courts Act</a>, 1971.           The learned

Standing Counsel for the Election Commission shall also inform

the respective authorities of the order passed now.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                  3</span>




</p><p id="p_6">        Consequently, the miscellaneous Applications, if any shall

stand closed.
</p>

</p><p id="p_8">                                     _____________________________
