ORAL
JUDGMENT</pre> 

 

 


 

<p id="p_1">[1]	By
way of  this petition under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_1">Article 227</a> of the Constitution of India,
petitioner - original defendant seeks to challenge the order
dated 22.01.2004 passed by learned Civil Judge (S.D.), Gondal below
Ex.8 in Special Civil Suit No.79 of 2000. 
</p>
 

 


 

<p id="p_2">[2]	The
brief facts for the purpose of deciding this petition can be
summarized as under.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_3">[2.1]	The
petitioner herein is the original defendant in Special Civil Suit
No.79 of 2000 filed by the respondent - original plaintiff in
the Court of Civil Judge (S.D.), Gondal for recovery of money based
on a purchase  contract between the parties. 
</p>
 

 


 

<p id="p_4">[3]	Record
reveals that written statement was filed by the petitioner -
original defendant and in the written statement an objection has been
raised as regards territorial jurisdiction of the trial Court, Gondal
to try the suit. The Civil Court
then  proceeded to frame issues as it is evident from the statement
made by learned counsel Mr.A. R.Thacker appearing for the respondent.
The evidence of the original plaintiff has already been lead by way
of affidavit under the provision of Order-18, Rule 14 of Civil
Procedure Code. 
</p>
 

 


 

<p id="p_5">[4]	However,
the petitioner - original defendant preferred an application
Ex.8 in Special Civil Suit No.79 of 2000 requesting the Court to
frame a preliminary issue as regards the territorial jurisdiction of
the Court. This application was preferred by the petitioner -
original defendant relying on the purchase order dated 23.05.1997 at
Annexure - "A" to this petition which provides that all
or any disputes in transaction shall be subject to Mumbai
jurisdiction only. However, there is some dispute raised as regards
the purchase order and the terms and conditions stipulated in the
same. 
</p>
 

 


 

<p id="p_6">[5]	I
have heard learned counsel Mr.N. K. Pahwa appearing for Thakkar
Associates for the petitioner and  learned counsel Mr.A. R. Thacker
appearing for the respondent. 
</p>
 

 


 

<p id="p_7">[6]	Learned
counsel Mr.N. K. Pahwa for the petitioner submitted that the impugned
order is contrary to the provisions of Order 14 Rule 2(2) of the
Civil Procedure Code. He would submit that the learned Judge has
wrongly held that issue regarding jurisdiction cannot be raised as a
preliminary issue as it is necessary to led oral evidence for
deciding the said issue. He would submit that from the contents of
the documents produced in the suit, learned Civil Judge could have
easily decided the issue of jurisdiction as raised as a preliminary
issue. He heavily relied on the purchase order dated 23.05.1997 at
Annexure - A page No.11 and invited the attention the Court to
clause 19 which deal the jurisdiction. Clause 19 reads as under. 
</p>
 

 


 


<p id="p_8">"19.
</p><p id="p_9">Jurisdiction :- All or any disputes in above transaction shall be
subject to Mumbai jurisdiction only"
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_10">	He
would submit that it is not open to the parties to confer by their
agreement jurisdiction on a Court which it does not possess under the
Code. But where two courts or more have under the Code of Civil
Procedure jurisdiction to try a suit or a proceeding, an agreement
between the parties that the dispute between them shall be tried in
one of such courts is not contrary to public policy. Such an
agreement does not contravene <a href="/doc/1224074/" id="a_2">Section 28</a> of the Contract Act. Learned
counsel Mr.Pahwa  relied upon ruling of the Supreme Court in the case
of Hanil Era Textiles Limited Vs. Puromatic Filters (P) Ltd.,
reported in (2004) 4 SCC 671. 
</p>
 

 


 

<p id="p_11">[7]	Per-contra,
learned counsel Mr.A. R. Thacker submitted that the learned Judge has
not committed any error muchless an error of law warranting any
interference by this Court under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_3">Article 227</a> of the Constitution of
India. He vehemently submitted that there are disputed questions of
facts involved in the matter. Relying upon the averments made in the
plaint he submitted that the purchase order dated 23.05.1997 produced
by the defendant is not in the name of the plaintiff. He submitted
that it is in the name of one Mr.Rajesh I. Patel who has nothing to
do with the proprietary concern. He submitted that a reply was filed
opposing application Ex.8 and in the said reply it has been
categorically  stated that there was a talk with the defendant as
regards the jurisdiction of the Court in the event if any dispute
arises and at that point of time, the defendant had assured the
plaintiff that the jurisdiction would be that of Jetpur Court in
Gujarat and not at Bombay. He would submit that in good faith at that
point of time relying upon the word necessary correction  was not
effected in the purchase order. 
</p>
 

 


 

<p id="p_12">[8]	Prima
facie I am of the view keeping in mind reply at page No.16 filed by
the plaintiff to the application Ex.8 that purchase order has not
been disputed. However, plaintiff has raised dispute of a very
peculiar nature saying that since he was assured by the defendant as
regards the place of jurisdiction which would be Jetpur in Gujarat,
the plaintiff did not effect necessary correction in the purchase
order which provides the place of jurisdiction. I am of the view,
without going into any further controversy that the Civil Court can
be directed to frame preliminary issue as regards the territorial
jurisdiction of the Court. After framing the preliminary issue, the
trial Court shall lead evidence and decide the same in accordance
with law. This appears to be inconsonance with Order 14, Rule 2 of
the Civil Procedure Code. Order 14, Rule 2 reads as under :-
</p> 

 


 


<p id="p_13">"[2.
</p><p id="p_14">Court to pronounce judgment on all issues. - (1) Notwithstanding that
a case may be disposed of on a preliminary issue, the Court shall,
subject to the provisions of sub-rule (2), pronounce judgment on all
issues. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_15">(2)	Where
issues both of law and of fact arise in the same suit, and the Court
is of opinion that the case or any part thereof may be disposed of on
an issue of law only, it may try that issue first if that issue
relates to -
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_16">(a)	the
jurisdiction of the Court, or
 


</p><p id="p_17">(b)	a
bar to the suit created by any law for the time being in 	force.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_18">And for
the purpose may, if it thinks fit, postpone the settlement of the
other issues until after that issue has been determined, any may deal
with the suit in accordance with the decision on that issue]
 

 


 

[9]	From
the above it is clear that under Rule 2, Order 14 of CPC, where the
issues both of law and of fact arise in the same suit, and the Court
is of opinion that the case or any part thereof may be disposed of on
an issue of law only, it shall try those issues first and for that
purpose may, if it thinks fit, postpone the settlement of other
issues of fact until after those issues of law have been determined. 
</p>
 

 


 

<p id="p_19">[10]	Further
a comparative reading of Order 14, Rule 2, as it existed earlier to
1976 Amendment and the one after Amendment, would clearly indicate
that the consideration of an issue and its disposal as a preliminary
issue has, after the 1976 Amendment, been made permissible only in a
limited case. Those issues are of law relate to (I) the jurisdiction
of Court, or (ii) a bar to the suit created by any law for the time
being in force. Apart from this, no issue can be tried as a
preliminary issue. 
</p>
 

 


 

<p id="p_20">[11]	Thus,
where the Court came to the conclusion that there is a pure question
of law to be decided as a preliminary issue, the Order, refusing to
decide the preliminary issue on the mere ground that the Court did
not favour dispose of the suits on preliminary points is not
justified and is liable to be interfered with under appropriate
provisions of law. 
</p>
 

 


 

<p id="p_21">[12]	Issue
at jurisdiction of a Court could not be said to be purely an issue of
law, some cases issue involved mixed questions of fact and law.
Merely because some evidence was required to be taken an issue could
not be refused to be tried as preliminary issue such as an issue
regarding jurisdiction or maintainability of suit or Court-fee.
However, Courts could try issue as preliminary issue only if the
facts are independent and self-contained and do not have any bearing
on the facts which may arise for consideration of the suit. 
</p>
 

 


 

<p id="p_22">[13]	In
the above view of the matter, the Court having civil jurisdiction
must entertain the suit and prior to settling all the other issues
involved in the suit, based on the facts and circumstances, shall
frame the legal issue regarding maintainability of the suit as a
preliminary issue and allowing parties to place evidence on record in
the manner required under law, shall decide that issue, which will
resolve the question of maintainability and shall proceed according
to the result arrived at for the said issue.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_23">[14]	I
could have decided this issue relying on the Supreme Court ruling in
the case of Hanil Era Textiles Limited Vs. Puromatic Filters (P) Ltd.
(Supra) in which the judgment in the case of A.B.C. Laminart (P) Ltd.
Vs. A. P. Agencies, AIR 1989 SC 1239 has also been considered.
However,  in view of some dispute  being raised by the plaintiff in
this regard, I deem it fit and proper to  direct the Civil Court to
frame preliminary issue of jurisdiction and allow both the parties to
lead evidence on this limited issue. In the above view of the matter,
the petition is disposed of by issuing following directions:-
</p> 

 


 


<p id="p_24">(1)	Civil
Court is directed to frame preliminary issue as to whether it has got
territorial jurisdiction to decide the Civil Suit or not.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_25">(2)	After
framing the preliminary issue, Civil Court shall permit both the
parties to lead evidence only to this limited extent of territorial
jurisdiction and pass appropriate orders in this regard giving
finding on the preliminary issue.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_26">(3)	Since
this Court has directed the Civil Court to frame preliminary issue as
regards the jurisdiction, the Civil Court shall postpone the
settlement of other issues until the issue as regards the territorial
jurisdiction is finally determined. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_27">(4)	Civil
Court shall deal with the suit i.e. other issues in accordance with
the decision on the preliminary issue. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_28">(5)	Civil
Court shall undertake exercise within 15 days from the date of
receipt of this order and shall pass final order in this regard on or
before 31.12.2011. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_29">(6)	Both
the parties are directed to cooperate and see to it that the order
passed by this Court is in its true effect.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_30">[9]	The
petition stands disposed of with no order as to costs. 
</p>
