      SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT &amp; ORS.              RESPONDENT(S)



                J U D G M E N T
</pre><p id="p_1">A.M. KHANWILKAR, J.
</p>
<p id="p_2">1.    The detenu's mother filed  a  writ  petition  in  the  High  Court  of
judicature  at  Madras  bearing  H.C.P.  No.117  of  2016  challenging   the
Detention Order  N.1227/BCDFGISSSV/2015  dated  04.12.2015.   The  principal
contention pursued before the High Court was that the typed set  of  booklet
furnished along  with  the  impugned  detention  order  to  the  detenu  was
illegible, in particular, the copy of the F.I.R. in respect of Crime  No.598
of 2015  dated  18th  March,  2015.   The  High  Court  negatived  the  said
contention on the finding that the detenu did not  make  any  representation
to the  Appropriate Authority nor brought the said fact  to  the  notice  of
the concerned authority.  Further, no  such  plea  was  taken  in  the  writ
petition.  Another contention raised before the High Court that the name  of
the Judge has not been correctly mentioned in the remand orders supplied  to
the detenu, has also been rejected by the High Court  on  the  finding  that
the same  can  be  no  ground  to  quash  the  detention  order.   No  other
contention was pursued before the High Court.
</p><p id="p_3">2.    In the present  special  leave  petition  the  petitioner  has  raised
different grounds  to  challenge  the  impugned  detention  order.   In  the
special leave petition and the application for  urging  additional  grounds,
following points have been urged, which were reiterated  during  the  course
of arguments:
</p><p id="p_4">i)          The detention order does not mention  the  specific  period  for
which the same would operate and, therefore, it is vitiated.
</p><p id="p_5">ii)   There is no record to indicate that the next friend/family  member  of
the detenu was informed about  the  factum  of  detention  at  the  earliest
opportunity.
</p><p id="p_6">iii)  The satisfaction recorded by the Detaining Authority is inter alia  on
the basis of a confessional statement which,  however,  does  not  bear  the
signature of the detenu and, therefore, could not  have  been  relied  upon.
This has impacted the subjective satisfaction of the Detaining Authority.
</p><p id="p_7">iv)   Copy of the F.I.R.  furnished to the detenu (at page Nos.79-80 of  the
SLP paper book) is illegible and as a result of which the detenu was  denied
of an opportunity to make effective representation.
</p><p id="p_8">v)          The impugned detention order  refers  to  the  Government  order
dated 18th October, 2015 but copy of that document has  not  been  furnished
to the detenu, which is fatal to the continued detention of the detenu.
</p>
<p id="p_9">3.    Taking the first point urged  before  us,  the  same  deserves  to  be
stated to be rejected.  Inasmuch as the detention order has been  issued  by
the Commissioner of Police in exercise of powers  under  Section  3(1)  read
with Section 3(2) of the Tamil Nadu Prevention of  Dangerous  activities  of
Bootleggers,  Cyber  Law  Offenders,  Drug  Offenders,   Forest   Offenders,
Goondas, Immoral Traffic Offenders, Sand Offenders, Sexual  Offenders,  Slum
Grabbers and Video Pirates Act, 1982  (for short, 'the Act of  1982').   The
grounds of detention served  on  the  detenu  expressly  mentions  that  the
detention order shall remain in force for 12 days  in  the  first  instance.
The proposal for confirmation of  detention  order  was  considered  by  the
Appropriate  Authority  (Deputy  Secretary  to  the  Government  dated  15th
December, 2015 read with the order passed by the  Deputy  Secretary  to  the
Government dated 29th February, 2016).  That makes it amply clear  that  the
detention period would continue up to  12  months.   The  initial  detention
order, upon confirmation thereof, would remain in force for a period  of  12
months.  Thus understood, the ground urged by the  petitioner  to  challenge
the detention of her son  Murugan  S/o.  Esakkimuthu  Thevar  is  devoid  of
merit.
</p><p id="p_10">4.    Reverting to the second point, even the same deserves to be  rejected,
inasmuch as the respondents have filed reply  affidavit  and  asserted  that
after the detention order  was  executed  and  the  detenu  was  taken  into
custody, intimation in that behalf was sent  to  his  brother  Venkatesh  by
registered post on 6th December, 2015.  The postal receipt  in  that  behalf
is also placed on record.  The fact so asserted has not  been  countered  by
the petitioner.  The intimation sent to the detenu's brother  and  the  memo
in that behalf is marked as Annexure R2  Thus,  it  is  not  a  case  of  no
intimation given to the next friend/family  member  of  the  detenu  at  the
earliest opportunity.  The petitioner placed reliance  on  the  decision  of
this Court in the case of <a href="/doc/501198/" id="a_1">D.K. Basu v. State of West Bengal</a>,  (1997)  1  SCC
416, in particular paragraph 35 enunciating the procedure to be  adopted  in
all cases of arrest or detention.  In clause (4) of the  said  paragraph  it
is predicated that the time, place of arrest and  venue  of  custody  of  an
arrestee must be notified by the police where the next  friend  or  relative
of the arrestee lives outside the district or town  through  the  Legal  Aid
Organization in the District and the police station of  the  area  concerned
telegraphically within a period of 8 to 12 hours after the arrest.  We  find
force in the submission of the learned counsel for the respondent  that  the
procedure about arrest of a person and sending intimation dealt with by  the
Supreme Court is essentially in respect of  arrest  of  a  criminal  and  to
interrogate him during the investigation.  In any case, in  the  absence  of
telegraphic service available, as of now,  intimation  sent  to  the  family
member of the detenu by  registered  post  in  addition  to  the  telephonic
intimation must be considered as substantial compliance of the  requirement.
 Counsel for the petitioner, however, has placed reliance  on  the  decision
of the High Court of Madras in the case of <a href="/doc/1580282/" id="a_2">Shanmugam and  Another  v.  State
of Tamil Nadu and Another</a>, (2013) 4 MLJ (Crl) 1.  In  that  case  the  stand
taken by the authority was that intimation was given to the next  friend  of
the detenu over cell phone/land line phone.  The Court  opined  that  it  is
difficult to ascertain the correctness of that position  and  intimation  by
land line telephone/cell phone must be eschewed.  The  Court  observed  that
even if no telegraphic service was available, in such a situation  it  would
be appropriate to send intimation by e-post as introduced by the  Department
of Posts, Government of India with effect from 30.01.2004.  That  suggestion
has been given in paragraph 25 of the judgment.  The fact  remains  that  in
the present case intimation was given to the family member of the detenu  by
registered post as well as on telephone. As  observed  earlier,  substantial
compliance of giving information to the family  member  of  the  detenu  has
been done.  Hence, the argument under consideration  need  not  be  examined
any further.
</p><p id="p_11">5.    The third ground urged by the petitioner is about the reliance  placed
on  alleged  confessional  statement  given  by  the   detenu   during   the
investigation of the ground case.  The fact that no signature of the  detenu
has been noted on the said confessional statement, it would  at  best  be  a
ground to discard  that document in a criminal trial being  inadmissible  in
evidence. That by itself  is  not  sufficient  to  question  the  subjective
satisfaction reached by the Detaining Authority. What is  also  required  to
be considered is: whether the said voluntary confessional statement was  the
sole basis  to arrive at the subjective satisfaction.  On a fair reading  of
the grounds of detention, we must hold that the said confessional  statement
is not the solitary document or circumstance  considered  by  the  Detaining
Authority.  The grounds of detention has referred to  the  F.I.R.  in  Crime
No.2348 of 2015 under <a href="/doc/1599401/" id="a_3">Sections 341</a>, <a href="/doc/1198799/" id="a_4">294(b)</a>,  <a href="/doc/1011035/" id="a_5">323</a>,  <a href="/doc/1944660/" id="a_6">384</a>  and  <a href="/doc/180217/" id="a_7">506(II)</a>  I.P.C.
read with Section 4 of Tamil Nadu Public Property (Prevention of Damage  and
<a href="/doc/939004/" id="a_8">Loss) Act</a>; and  the  background  in  which  the  said  case  was  registered
including the seriousness of the offence.  Reliance has been placed  on  the
fact that during the investigation of the case, the  Assistant  Commissioner
of Police was informed that the detenu who  was  absconding  in  the  ground
case, was apprehended  in  connection  with  another  crime.   After  taking
orders  of  the  Assistant  Commissioner  of  Police,  Thiru  N.  Elangovan,
Inspector of Police, Law and Order, J4 Kotturpuram Police  Station  arrested
the detenu on 2.11.2015 at 21.30 hrs.  After his arrest he  was  brought  to
Chennai.  On 31st November, 2015 at 13.30  hrs.  while  police  party  along
with the accused were returning to Chennai, opposite to Central  Polytechnic
the detenu informed that he wanted to attend to nature's call.  When he  was
permitted to go, he pushed the police and jumped a locked gate and tried  to
escape from the police custody.  In his attempt to flee,  he  fell  down  on
his knee and sustained injuries.  The police party after  chasing  him  once
again arrested him.   They  took  him  to  a  nearby  Government  Royapettah
Hospital for treatment as out patient.  The detenu was later on handed  over
to the Inspector of Police,  J4  Kottupuram  Police  Station,  who  in  turn
recorded the alleged  voluntary  confessional  statement.   The  grounds  of
detention  also  advert  to  the  fact  that  the  detenu  was  arrested  in
connection with other serious offences under <a href="/doc/1198799/" id="a_9">Section 294(b)</a>, <a href="/doc/1599401/" id="a_10">341</a>, <a href="/doc/1011035/" id="a_11">323</a>,  <a href="/doc/175699/" id="a_12">336</a>,
<a href="/doc/1865117/" id="a_13">397</a> and <a href="/doc/180217/" id="a_14">506(ii)</a> I.P.C. but was released on bail.   The  Detaining  Authority
has recorded his subjective satisfaction that the detenu  is  likely  to  be
released on bail even in connection with the ground case  where  he  was  on
remand till 17th December, 2015; and if released on bail, he may indulge  in
similar prejudicial activities affecting the maintenance  of  public  order.
Suffice it to observe that the alleged confessional  statement  is  not  the
sole basis for forming subjective satisfaction of the  Detaining  Authority.
The Detaining Authority has considered all aspects of the matter and  taking
totality of circumstances into account deemed it  necessary  to  detain  the
detenu in exercise of powers under <a href="/doc/871966/" id="a_15">Section 3</a> of the 1982 Act.  Further,  the
fact that the alleged confessional statement does not bear the signature  of
the detenu will be of no avail, for  doubting  the  subjective  satisfaction
recorded by the Detaining Authority.  It is  well  settled  that  the  Court
must be loath  to  question  the  subjective  satisfaction  reached  by  the
Detaining Authority.  Hence, even this contention also does not  commend  to
us.
</p><p id="p_12">6.    The next argument pursued by the petitioner is that the  copy  of  the
F.I.R. in Crime No.598  of 2015 dated 18th March,  2015,  furnished  to  the
detenu is illegible.  Indeed, the said document  is  a  photo  copy  of  the
original.  The first page of the  document,  however,  gives  the  necessary
description of the offence.  The facts which constituted  that  offence  are
noted on the second page.  The second  page  of  the  document  is  somewhat
illegible, being photo stat copy.  Significantly, Crime No.598  of  2015  is
not the ground case.  The ground case is Crime No.2348  of  2015.   In  that
sense, the said F.I.R. at best is a referred  to  document  and  not  relied
upon document.  If so, it  is  not  possible  to  hold  that  the  continued
detention of the detenu is vitiated.  Counsel for the  petitioner,  however,
placed reliance on the decision of this Court in the  case  of  <a href="/doc/1669684/" id="a_16">Abdul  Latif
Abdul  Wahab  Sheikh  v.  B.K.  Jha  and  Another</a>,   (1987)  2  SCC  22,  in
particular, on the dictum in paragraph 5 thereof.  In that case,  the  Court
was dealing with the efficacy  of  procedural  requirement  and  compliances
thereof.  The Court noted that the  procedural  requirements  are  the  only
safeguards available to a detenu since the  Court  is  not  expected  to  go
behind the subjective satisfaction of the Detaining Authority.  It  went  on
to observe that the procedural requirements are, therefore, to  be  strictly
complied with if any value is to be attached to the liberty of  the  subject
and the constitutional rights guaranteed to him in that regard.   There  can
be no quarrel with this proposition.  The question is,  whether  the  F.I.R.
in Crime No.598 of 2015 furnished to the detenu is a  relied  upon  document
or only a referred to document by the Detaining Authority  for  arriving  at
his subjective satisfaction.  If it is a relied  upon  document,  the  issue
must be answered in favour of the petitioner.  As aforesaid,  we  find  that
the subject F.I.R. is  only  a  referred  to  document  in  the  grounds  of
detention.
</p><p id="p_13">7.    Reliance was placed by the  learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  on
<a href="/doc/290439/" id="a_17">State of Tamil Nadu and Another  v.  Abdullah  Kadher  Batcha  and  Another</a>,
(2009) 1 SCC 333.  In paragraph 7, the Court observed thus:-
</p>
<p id="p_14">“7.   The Court has a duty to see whether the non-supply of any document  is
in any way prejudicial to the case of the detenu. The  High  Court  has  not
examined as to how the non-supply of the document called for had any  effect
on the detenu and/or whether the non-supply was prejudicial to  the  detenu.
Merely because copies of some documents have (sic not)  been  supplied  they
cannot by any stretch of imagination be called  as  relied  upon  documents.
While examining whether non-supply of a document would prejudice  a  detenu,
the Court has to examine whether the detenu would be deprived of  making  an
effective representation in  the  absence  of  a  document.  Primarily,  the
copies which form the ground for detention  are  to  be  supplied  and  non-
supply thereof would prejudice the detenu. But documents  which  are  merely
referred to for the purpose of narration of facts in that  sense  cannot  be
termed  to  be  documents  without  the  supply  of  which  the  detenu   is
prejudiced.”

</p><p id="p_15">8.     Reliance  was  also  placed  on  the  decision   in   the   case   of
<a href="/doc/1253865/" id="a_18">Senthamilselvi v.  State  of  T.N.  and  Another</a>,  (2006)  5  SCC  676.   In
paragraph 7 of this decision, the Court observed thus:-
“7.   There  is  also  no  substance  in  the  plea  that  the  confessional
statement of the co-accused was relied upon, but the copy  thereof  was  not
supplied. The grounds of detention merely refer to the confession by the co-
accused. That does not form foundation for the detention. On the other  hand
it appears that the detenu himself made a confession and that was  the  main
factor on which the order of detention was  founded.  There  is  distinction
between a relied upon document and a document which  has  been  referred  to
without being relied upon. The distinction has been noticed  by  this  Court
in <a href="/doc/813606/" id="a_19">Powanammal v. State of T.N</a>., [(1999) 2 SCC 413] SCC at  p.417,   para  9.
It was observed as follows:
</p><p id="p_16">      "However, this Court has maintained a distinction between  a  document
which has been relied upon by the detaining  authority  in  the  grounds  of
detention and a document which finds a mere  reference  in  the  grounds  of
detention. Whereas the non-supply of a copy of the document relied  upon  in
the grounds of detention has been held to be fatal to  continued  detention,
the detenu need not show that any  prejudice  is  caused  to  him.  This  is
because the non-supply of such a document would  amount  to  denial  of  the
right  of  being  communicated  the  grounds  and  of  being  afforded   the
opportunity of making an effective representation against the order. But  it
would not be so where the document merely finds a reference in the order  of
detention or among the  grounds  thereof.  In  such  a  case,  the  detenu's
complaint of non-supply of document has to be supported by prejudice  caused
to him in making an effective representation. What  applies  to  a  document
would equally apply to furnishing a translated copy of the document  in  the
language known to and understood by the detenu, should the document be in  a
different language.”

</p><p id="p_17">9.    We fail to understand as to how these decisions will be of  any  avail
to the petitioner in the backdrop of the findings recorded  above  that  the
copy of F.I.R. furnished to the detenu in respect of Crime  No.598  of  2015
is only a referred to document.  In the present  case,  no  grievance  about
the  illegible  copy  was  ever  made  by  the  detenu  to  any   Authority.
Strikingly, the detenu has not made  any  representation  to  any  Authority
much less to assert that the said document is a  relied  upon  document  and
furnishing of illegible copy was fatal.  As a  result,  this  argument  also
deserves to be stated to be rejected.
</p><p id="p_18">10.   That takes us to the last ground urged before us about the  non-supply
of Government order dated 18th October,  2015.   This  contention  has  been
raised by way of application for  urging  additional  grounds.   During  the

Given under my hand and seal of this office,

</p><p id="p_38">12.   From the plain language of the impugned detention order,  it  is  seen
that the stated Government Order  dated  18th  October,  2015  is  an  order
issued by the State  Government  authorizing  or  delegating  power  to  the
Commissioner of Police, Chennai, to issue order under <a href="/doc/1499422/" id="a_32">Section  3(2)</a>  of  the
Act of 1982.  The question is, whether it was mandatory  for  the  Detaining
Authority to supply copy of this Government order to the detenu.  The  order
having been issued in exercise of powers conferred  under  <a href="/doc/1472134/" id="a_33">Section  3(1)</a>  of
the Act of 1982 and being a statutory order  has  nothing  to  do  with  the
grounds of detention.  What is imperative is to  supply  all  the  documents
which are relied upon by the  Detaining  Authority  for  forming  subjective
satisfaction for the purposes  of  <a href="/doc/1709581/" id="a_34">Article  22(5)</a>  of  the  Constitution  of
India.  The Government order, however, is regarding the delegation of  power
to the Commissioner of Police to issue detention  order.   The  validity  of
that order has not been challenged by the petitioner.  In other  words,  the
power of the Commissioner of Police,  Greater  Chennai  Police,  Chennai  to
pass a detention order, is not put in issue.  The said Government  order  is
not  relevant  for  forming  subjective  satisfaction   by   the   Detaining
Authority. The grounds of detention are about the prejudicial activities  in
which the detenu had indulged in the past; or in the view of  the  Detaining
Authority the detenu has the propensity to indulge  in  similar  prejudicial
activities even in future.  That is the quintessence for  exercising   power
to detain any person.  Suffice it to observe that the subject document,  not
being a relied upon document in the grounds  of  detention  or  for  forming
subjective satisfaction by the Detaining Authority, failure to furnish  copy
thereof to the detenu does not vitiate the action  taken  by  the  Detaining
Authority nor the continued detention of the detenu.  In our  opinion,  even
this submission is devoid of merits.
</p><p id="p_39">13.   The counsel  for  the  petitioner,  relying  on  the  decision  in  <a href="/doc/1830815/" id="a_35">R.
Kalavathi v. State of T.N. and Others</a>, (2006) 6  SCC  14,  lastly  contended
that the subjective satisfaction of the Detaining Authority is founded  only
on solitary ground case being Crime No.2348 of 2015.  According to  him,  an
action under the Act of 1982 can be initiated or resorted  to  only  against
habitual offenders and not where it  is  a  case  of  solitary  crime.   The
argument, though attractive at the first blush, deserves to be stated to  be
rejected.  The ground of detention must be read as a whole.   No  doubt,  it
principally relies on the ground case being Crime No.2348 of 2015  but  also
adverts to other serious offences registered against the detenu and  pending
trial, such as Crime No.598 of 2015 registered at  D.6  Anna  Square  Police
Station; Crime No.3/2015 registered at Aavudaiyar Koil  Police  Station  and
including the conduct of the detenu when he  tried  to  escape  from  police
custody.  The totality of the circumstances having been taken  into  account
by the Detaining Authority, there is  no  reason  to  doubt  the  subjective
satisfaction arrived at for issuance of the  impugned  detention  order,  in
the fact situation of the present  case.   Notably,  this  ground  has  been
urged in the rejoinder submissions.     Accordingly,  even  this  contention
does not deserve any further consideration.
