              Writ Petition No. 1707 of 2009
12-07-2011
     Shri     P.   K.    Asati,   learned   counsel   for    the
petitioner.
     Shri S. K. Rao, learned senior counsel with Shri
Snjeev Kumar Chaurvedi, learned counsel for the
respondents.</pre>
<p id="p_1">     With consent, matter is heard finally.
     This petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1">Article 226</a> of the Constitution
of India is directed against the order dated 18-12-2008
the decision is taken by the Disciplinary Authority to
recommence         the    departmental      enquiry    during
pendency of the Criminal Case.
</p><p id="p_2">     Briefly stated, the relevant facts are that, theft of
400 US Dollars was detected in the year 1995 when
the petitioner was posted as Bill Collector, Union Bank
of India, Malviya Nagar, Bhopal. The detection led to
two fold action; viz., lodging of an F.I.R. at P.S.
Jahangirabad, which resulted in commencement of
criminal prosecution for an offence under <a href="/doc/1436241/" id="a_2">section 420</a>
of the Indian Penal Code, which is being tried in the
Court of Judicial Magistrate First Class, Bhopal, and
secondly issuance of charge sheet on 06-02-1997.
</p><p id="p_3">     Petitioner during proceedings of departmental
enquiry by taking shelter of clause 19 of the Bipartite
                                                        WP 1707.09



Agreement sought stay of enquiry proceedings because
of pending criminal trial. That, pending clarification
from the Headquarters, the proceedings were stayed.
</p><p id="p_4">      Subsequently    thereafter,   by    an   order     dated
18-12-2008 it was decided to recommence the enquiry
mainly for the reasons that for 7 years there being no
substantial progress of the criminal case and that the
nature of charges levelled against the petitioner being
different from the criminal charge.
</p><p id="p_5">      Petitioner is aggrieved by the said decision.
      It is contended on behalf of the petitioner that the
departmental enquiry if allowed to continue would lead
to disclosure of defence of the petitioner which in turn
would cause grave prejudice to the criminal trial.
</p><p id="p_6">      The respondents on their turn oppose the plea for
stay of departmental proceedings.
</p><p id="p_7">      Law    regarding    initiation/continuation       of          a
departmental enquiry during pendency of the Criminal
proceedings has come to be settled that the later will
not   automatically   lead   to   stay   the   departmental
proceedings. <a href="/doc/1051592/" id="a_3">In Indian Overseas Bank Annasalai and
another V. P. Ganesan &amp; others</a>: (2008) 1 SCC 650 it is
held by the Supreme Court that "18. Legal           position
operating in the field is no longer res integra. A
departmental    proceeding        pending      a    criminal
                                                     WP 1707.09



proceeding does not warrant an automatic stay. The
superior Court before exercising       its    discretionary
jurisdiction   in   this   regard   must         take    into
consideration the fact as to whether         the charges as
also the evidences in both          the proceedings       are
common and as to whether any complicated question
of law is involved         in the matter." It was further
observed in paragraph 23 that what is necessary to be
noticed is not only the existence of identical facts and
the evidence in the matter, but also whether charges
levelled against the delinquent            officer, both in
criminal and departmental proceedings are same and
that non-stay of disciplinary proceedings shall not only
prejudice the delinquent officers but the matter also
involves a complicated question of law.
</p><p id="p_8">     In an earlier judgment, i.e., <a href="/doc/1585130/" id="a_4">Hindustan Petroleum
Corporation Ltd. V. Sarvesh Berry</a> : (2005) 10 SCC 471
it has been held by Supreme Court that "11. There can
be no strait jacket formula      as to in which case the
departmental proceedings        are to be     stayed. There
may be cases where the trial of the case gets
prolonged by the dilatory method adopted            by the
delinquent official. He cannot be permitted to, on one
hand, prolong the Criminal case and at the same time
conted that the departmental proceedings should be
                                                             WP 1707.09



stayed on the    ground that criminal case is pending."
In the     case delinquent          official was facing the
Criminal charge for an offence under <a href="/doc/86648814/" id="a_5">Section 13(1)</a> (e),
13(2) of the <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_6">Prevention of Corruption Act</a>, 1988, yet the
departmental enquiry was permitted to continue.
</p><p id="p_9">     In the case at hand none of the parties                   have
taken steps to bring on record the Criminal charges
framed    against the petitioner. However,            taking the
case to be under <a href="/doc/1436241/" id="a_7">section 420</a> of IPC when compared
with the charges levelled against the petitioner in the
departmental     proceedings,       it   is   clear        that      in
departmental     enquiry the charges are regarding
conduct of the petitioner in his disposition                 as an
employee of the Bank and as a member of public. It is
the breach committed       to a master servant relation,
wherein by displaying conduct involving of a bank
employee, the petitioner invited         a charge sheet and
consequential    departmental enquriy which in given
facts of case cannot be interfered with.
</p><p id="p_10">     In   the   result   petition    fails    and     is    hereby
dismissed. No costs.
