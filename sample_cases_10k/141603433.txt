       Mr. Balaram Datta .....for the petitioner

       Mr. Sahidul Islam        .....for the State


         Affidavit of service filed in court today be kept with the records.

         The short facts of the case are as follows:-

         The petitioner was appointed as a Head Teacher in the concerned School under the respondents, Education</pre>

<p id="p_1">Department and he had retired from service on 31.01. 2011.
</p>
<p id="p_2">         The learned advocate for the petitioner submits that the respondent authorities issued Pension Payment Order

on 21.10.2011. As such, the respondent authorities have delayed to pay the gratuity amount. The learned advocate

further submits that his client approached the respondent authorities to claim interest on the delayed payment of

gratuity amount. They had not considered the same. Hence, the petitioner has filed the writ petition seeking relief to

pay interest at the rate of 18% per annum on the gratuity amount. He further submits that his client rendered long

service with the respondent authorities as a Head Teacher in the concerned school without any break and without any

adverse remark. Learned advocate also submits that the respondent authorities issued the pension payment order on

21.10.2011. Learned advocate further submits that as per <a href="/doc/553799/" id="a_1">Payment of Gratuity Act</a>, 1972 amount has to be paid to the

petitioner within a period of 45 days but the same has not been complied with. That judgment has been affirmed by the

Hon'ble Division Bench of this Court in MAT 1075 of 2004. Hence, this writ petition is filed before this Court for

direction upon the respondents and the Education Department to pay the interest at the rate of 18% per annum on the

delayed payment of gratuity amount.
</p>
<p id="p_3">         Learned advocate for the State submits that it is admitted that the petitioner had joined as a Head Teacher in

the concerned school and had retired from service on 31.01.2011 It is further submitted that the delay is not a deliberate

one but due to legal formalities and administrative process and as such the petitioner is not entitled to receive interest

on the gratuity amount.
</p>
<p id="p_4">         Considering the facts and circumstances of the case and the argument advanced by the learned advocates for

both the parties, this Court is of the view that the petitioner had retired from service on 31.01.2011 but the pension
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                                              2</span>

payment order was issued on 21.10.2011 as well as the petitioner received the gratuity amount on 31.12.2011.

Therefore, there is a delay in paying the said gratuity amount. Hence, the petitioner is entitled to receive simple interest

at the rate of 9% per annum on the delayed payment of gratuity amount i.e. from 1st February, 2011 till the date of

receipt of the gratuity amount.
</p>
<p id="p_5">         Therefore, this Court directs the respondent authorities to pay interest for the delayed payment of gratuity

amount at the rate of 9% per annum within a period of 12 weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of this order.

</p><p id="p_6">         Accordingly, the writ petition is disposed of. There will, however, be no order as to costs.

         Urgent photostat certified copy of this order, if applied for, be given to the parties as early as possible.
