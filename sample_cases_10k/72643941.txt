<p id="p_1">3   17-11-2017                     Heard learned counsel for the petitioner and learned

                   APP for the State.
</p>
<p id="p_2">                                   Petitioner seeks bail in connection with Special

                   (POCSO) Case No. 48 of 2017 arising out of Dhamdaha P.S. Case

                   No. 128 of 2017 for offences punishable under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_1">Sections 302</a>, <a href="/doc/386021/" id="a_2">201</a>,

                   <a href="/doc/1279834/" id="a_3">376</a> of the Indian Penal Code and Section 3 and 4 of POCSO Act.

</p><p id="p_3">                                  The prosecution case, as lodged by the informant, is

                   that his seven year old daughter had gone to attend Bhoj ceremony

                   and come back home thereafter, the informant and his family

                   members went to attend bhohj and come back home. In the

                   morning, his daughter Bulbul Kumari was traceless and she was

                   found dead near the Panchayat Bhawan after two days. It is

             alleged that the petitioner, with whom there was previous enmity,

             who had a cycle repair shop, must have killed his daughter.

</p><p id="p_4">                            It has been submitted by the learned counsel for the

             petitioner that he is innocent and he is the next door neighbour of

             the informant. He submits that he bears no criminal antecedent and

             it is only on the basis of suspicion, he has been made accused.

</p><p id="p_5">                            However, learned APP for the State opposes the prayer

             for bail stating therein that the victim girl, aged seven year, was

             violently sexually assaulted and strangulated. The petitioner was

             the neighbour and he always used to lure the daughter of the

             informant by offering chocolates, for which the informant always

             objected. On the date of occurrence also the mother of the

             deceased child had told the petitioner that her daughter Bulbul

             Kumari is alone in the house.

<p id="p_6">                               Considering the facts and circumstances and the

             materials on record, I am not inclined to grant privilege of bail to

             the petitioner, and accordingly his prayer for bail stands rejected in

             connection with Special (POCSO) Case No. 48 of 2017 arising out

             of Dhamdaha P.S. Case No. 128 of 2017 pending before learned

             Additional District Judge-1st , Purnea.
