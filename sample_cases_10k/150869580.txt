                  entitled and from whom?
</p>
<p id="p_6">               3. Relief.
</p>

<p id="p_7">     4. Petitioner examined herself as PW足1. She tendered in evidence her
          affidavit Ex.PW1/A and relied upon the documents Ex.PW1/1 to

<p id="p_9">     6. Needless to say that for making someone entitled U/s 166 of the <a href="/doc/785258/" id="a_1">Motor
          Vehicle Act</a>, negligence of the driver of the offending vehicle needs to
          be proved and to prove the same the Tribunal need not go into the
          technicalities because strict rules of procedure and evidence are not
          followed. Basically, in road accident cases, Tribunal has simply to
          quantify the compensation which is just, rational and reasonable on the
          basis of enquiry. It is an admitted legal position that the negligence on
          part of the driver with respect to use of the vehicle needs to be
          established and the same is to be established on the principle of
          preponderance of probabilities as decided in <a href="/doc/31059227/" id="a_2">New India Assurance
          Co. Ltd. vs. Harsh Mishra &amp; Ors. III</a> (2015) ACC 435 Delhi.

          her. Due to the impact, she fell down and sustained injuries on her
          both legs and her left foot joint knee was fractured. She further stated
          that after the accident the respondent no.1 got down from the
          offending vehicle and started extending threats and abused her,
          stating that she is a lawyer and police cannot take any action against
          her. She further stated that after the accident the respondent tried to
          fled away from the spot, however, on the intervention of the public,

          who came to the hospital and called the police control room at 100
          number. The driver of the offending vehicle again abused her and her
          husband and ran away from the gate of the hospital.                     She further
          stated that she was admitted to the hospital vide registration no. 30488
          dated 02.03.2017.               She further stated that one police officer namely
          Megh Ram came in the hospital but he did not record her statement.
          She requested him to record her statement and lodge the FIR against
          the driver of the vehicle but he replied that the FIR would be registered
          on the basis of MLC. She further stated that on the same day her
          husband made written complaint to SHO PS Malviya Nagar but the
          police did not take any action against the driver of the offending
          vehicle.       She further stated that when pain and swelling could not

          been falsely implicated the respondent in the present case.
</p><p id="p_14">                    In the present case the Investigating Officer alongwith the DAR
          has filed FIR, charge sheet, site plan etc. As per the site plan, the
          injured was hit from behind. Hitting from behind per足se amounts to
          negligence, unless explained otherwise. Nothing material came in the
          cross足examination of PW足1 to dis足believe her version of accident. Even
          the charge sheet has been filed against the respondent. On the MLC
          history of road traffic accident has been mentioned. Therefore, in view
          of the testimony of PW足1 it is established on record that the petitioner
          suffered injuries in a road accident on 02.03.2017 at 5.30 p.m. due to
          rash and negligent driving of vehicle bearing no. DL 3C BU 5301 by
          Sneh Khattar and owned by Sneh Khattar.
</p><p id="p_15">                    Therefore, this issue is decided in favour of the petitioner and
          against the respondent.

<p id="p_16">     7. During the course of arguments ld. counsel for the respondent
          contended that the petitioner did not suffer the fracture due to the
          accident in question as she got treatment for the fracture after about
          18 days as mentioned in the prescription of Safdarjung Hospital, New
          Delhi.      Ld. counsel further contended that the fracture could have
          occurred due to some other accident after the accident in question and
          should not be attributed to the negligence of the respondent.
</p><p id="p_17">                    I am not convinced with the contention of the ld. counsel for the
          respondent. The petitioner after the accident approached the casualty
          at Pt. Madan Mohan Malviya Hospital on the same day and the

          examination shows that the doctor mentioned tenderness on left foot
          and advised X足ray of the left foot and ankle and referred her to AIIMS
          Trauma Center.
</p><p id="p_18">                    This is the allegation of the petitioner that on the day of accident
          the police did not register the FIR and she had to obtain an order from
          the court of Ld. Magistrate for registration of the same.
</p><p id="p_19">                    The contention of the petitioner supports the fact that she was
          formally got examined by the concerned police and her MLC was
          prepared at Safdarjung Hospital after about 18 days. The doctor while
          preparing the MLC again noted that the petitioner had pain in left and
          swelling in left foot and she was advised X足ray. The petitioner advised
          PoP slab i.e. plaster on her left foot.
</p><p id="p_20">                    The treatment as on record is continuous and I am convinced
          that the petitioner suffered the fracture due to the accident in question
          and not for any other reason.

<p id="p_21">     8. Now, comes the question as what compensation under different
          heads, the petitioner is entitled.

          30.11.2017 to 17.12.2017. Having regard to the injuries and treatment
          of the petitioner, I award her Rs.35,000/足 towards pain and sufferings
          and enjoyment of life.

<p id="p_27">          SPECIAL DIET, CONVEYANCE AND ATTENDANT CHARGES :
</p><p id="p_28">     11. In the present case the petitioner has not placed on record any
          document to show the expenses of special diet, conveyance and
          attendant charges. The injuries on the person of the petitioner were
          such that she must have taken special diet for her early recovery.
          Therefore, I award Rs. 3,000/足 to the petitioner towards special diet.
          OPD cards placed on record shows that she visited the hospital many
          times.       Therefore, I award Rs. 5,000/足 to the petitioner towards
          conveyance.
</p><p id="p_29">                    During evidence she stated that she hired an attendant namely
          Dukhiya Devi W/o Buddhu Singh from 05.03.2017 to 06.11.2017 on
          salary of Rs. 4500/足 p.m. She has placed on record a receipt issued
          by Dukhiya Devi Ex.PW1/27. In the said receipt she stated that the
          petitioner hired her for eight months @ Rs.150/足 p.m. and she paid a
          total sum of Rs. Rs.36,000/足 to her. In the present case the petitioner
          has not placed on record any documentary evidence i.e. voucher or
          cheque etc. through which she has paid the amount to Ms. Dukhiya

          Devi. Even she has not examined Ms. Dukhiya Devi in the Tribunal to
          prove that she has paid the amount to her.                 Therefore, I am not
          inclined to award Rs.36,000/足 to the petitioner towards attendant
          charges.         However, looking into the injuries and treatment of the
          petitioner, I award her Rs. 8,000/足 towards attendant charges.
          Therefore, the total award under this head comes to Rs. 16,000/足.

<p id="p_30">          LOSS OF INCOME :

          however, for the gratuitous services rendered by a housewife to her
          family, she has to be compensated, therefore, I award a lumpsum
