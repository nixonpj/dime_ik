<p id="p_8">             3.                The plaintiffs claimed the property as belonging to them and

             seek for an injunction by referring to the Civil Court decree obtained

             against the Panchayat that the property belonged to the proprietors on

             the basis of which mutation was also sanctioned as mutation No.2404 in

             the year 1967. The cause of action for the suit was that the Wakf Board

             was attempting to make a lease in respect of the property and the

             plaintiffs' possession was at the instance of Ajit Singh and one Kewal

             Krishan, who claimed as lessees under the Wakf Board. The suit was

             dismissed and in the appeal filed by the plaintiffs, there was a reversal

             of the judgment holding that the Wakf Board had not established its

             right of ownership in respect of the property.          The trial Court while

             dismissing the suit had observed that the decree obtained by the

             plaintiffs was not shown to be correlated to the mutations that were

             sanctioned but in the Appellate Court, the local commissioner's report

             was noticed, who had inspected the property and carried out

             demarcation that spelt out that the new numbers that had come into

             existence during consolidation and mentioned in mutation as Ex.P8 and

             that they were really the properties in respect of which the plaintiffs

             had obtained a Civil Court decree. The mutation itself had been only in

             respect of those numbers which had come within the municipal limits

             and new numbers allotted during consolidations were all mentioned in

             the mutation. Accepting the plea of the plaintiffs that there had been a

             proper correlation of the properties in the Civil Court decree to the

             property claimed by them under the mutation, the suit was decreed.

             would contend that there are revenue entries in Ex.P5 to P7

             commencing from the year 1961 referring to the suit property as

             kabristan and a gazette notification had also been issued under Ex.

             DW1/13 referring to the property as wakf. The plea, therefore, would

             be that it is a property which vests in the wakf and Wakf Board is

             entitled to deal with the same free from any obstruction from the

             plaintiffs.       Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondents

             would join issues on the revenue entry by pointing out that gazette

             notification itself is not binding on third parties, who are asserting an

             independent title and the notification made under <a href="/doc/1805487/" id="a_2">Section 5(2)</a> of the

             Wakf Act cannot be conclusive against persons, who are asserting their

             own right over the property.
</p>
<p id="p_10">             5.                In this case, there has been a previous litigation in respect

             of the very same subject matter and the plaintiffs are shown to be

             representatives of proprietors of the village.             If the civil court

             proceeding was even earlier in point of time in the year 1961 when the

             jamabandi contains reference to the property as kabristan then it should

             be taken as a document where a right was asserted by persons contrary

             to what was recited in the jamabandi.               The subsequent mutation

             effected in the year 1967 also refers to the property as the property

             held by the plaintiffs as proprietors and consequently when a suit for

             injunction was sought, the plaintiffs' own right could not have been

             defeated by the Wakf Board unless a particular manner of user was

             established. The definition of wakf under <a href="/doc/1148829/" id="a_3">Section 2(r)</a> of the Wakf Act

             makes irrelevant a cessation of use of a property dedicated in wakf. But

             in this case, the dedication is for burial of dead bodies. There was no

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">              RSA No.2951 of 1985                                            -4-</span>

             attempt of even any of the defendants to contend that this property had

             been actually used for burial of bodies at any time in the recent years.

             That is precisely the reason why the Wakf Board does not claim the

             property for use as kabristan but for lease for agricultural purposes.

             While I will not go as far as to state that the property if it had been

             dedicated, could lose the character by such non-user, at least for the

             purpose of grant of relief of injunction, it should be relevant for me to

             see whether the Wakf Board at any point of time had put the property

             to such use for which it was dedicated. An attempt by the Wakf Board

             to lease out the property would in fact completely derogate from the

             very kind of compulsion of user of the property made for burial of dead

             bodies.           The Court need not have gone beyond examination of whether

             the defendants could have lawfully prevented the plaintiffs from seeking

             for the relief of injunction based on their previous possession. If the

             contention of the Wakf Board was that there was a kabristan and hence

             a wakf is always a wakf and the plaintiffs were contending that the

             property was granted in the civil court decree against the Panchayat

             that was belonged to the proprietors then there was surely an occasion

             for the Wakf Board to seek an adjudication that the property itself was

             wakf which was being denied by the plaintiffs. For the limited purpose

             of injunction, the suit ought to have been decreed in the manner that

             the appellate Court did and therefore, there is no scope for any

             interference in appeal. The second appeal is, therefore, required to be

             dismissed.
