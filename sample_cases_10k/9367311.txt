 IN THE HIGH COURT OF JUDICATURE FOR RAJASTHAN
BENCH AT JAIPUR

ORDER
IN
S.B. Civil Writ Petition No.7232/2011

Mukesh Kumar Meena Vs. Director Literacy and Continuing Education, Shiksha Sankul, Jaipur and Another

Date of Order ::: 31.05.2011

Present
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Rafiq


Shri Kailash Sharma for
Shri Devendra Kumar Bhardwaj, counsel for petitioner
####

By the Court:-</pre>

<p id="p_1">Learned counsel for petitioner has relied on judgment of coordinate bench of this court in Writ Petition No.3284/2009  Mahendra Kumar Sharma Vs. State of Rajasthan and Others, dated 08.03.2011, and argued that present matter is similar to that.
</p><p id="p_2">Counsel for petitioner submit that petitioner is poor employees and once this Court has finally decided the controversy, the judgment may be made applicable in rem and each applicant may not be called upon to seek same relief as granted obviously in terms of modification made by Division Bench. 
</p><p id="p_3">Counsel further submits that the controversy raised herein was initially examined and decided by co-ordinate Bench of this Court vide order dated 30.06.2009 in Ramjeet Singh and others Vs. Union of India &amp; Ors, (Civil Writ Petition No.4119/2009 &amp; cognate petitions) and in para 7 &amp; 8 it was observed ad infra:-		
</p>
<p id="p_4">I have gone through the record of the writ petitions and considered the rival submissions of the parties. In my view, the letter dated 19.01.2009 clearly reveals that the revised scheme is to be implemented instead of old scheme, hence, mere change of the scheme will not result in unemployment and fresh selection. However, the petitioners cannot claim the wages of the intervening period on account of non allotment of the budget.
</p>
<p id="p_5">The action of the respondents envisages the impugned orders of termination of the present petitioners is declared illegal and the petitioners are allowed to continue on their respective posts till the scheme of Lok Talim is implemented. However, they will be entitled for continuity in service but not entitled to fixed remuneration for the intervening period in case the scheme of Lok Talim is implemented.
</p>
<p id="p_6">Against the order dated 30.06.2009 (supra), DB Civil Special Appeals (517/2010 and cognates appeals) were preferred by the State of Rajasthan and have been dismissed by common judgment dated 01.10.2010 and the relief granted by the learned Single Judge has been modified and finally observed as under :-
</p>
<p id="p_7">To the recourse proposed by the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondents, counsel for the appellants has no objection. Hence, the order of the Single Bench is accordingly modified to the extent that it would be open to the appellants to screen the candidates for the purposes of ensuring that they are holding the requisite qualification under the new scheme and adjustment of such incumbent shall be made at other centre in order to ensure the composition as per the new scheme of one man and one woman candidate at one centre is maintained and services of only those candidates be discontinued who are not qualified or it is not possible to accommodate them. However, while doing so, no discrimination be made between the incumbents and rule of last come first go shall be adhered to.			
</p><p id="p_8">As regards judgment (supra) it has not been controverted by Government Counsel about the controversy being decided by this Court. 
</p><p id="p_9">It certainly goes without saying that once modification has been made by Division Bench of this Court, the Government is under obligation to follow the directions of the Division Bench, and taking note of the submissions made (supra), this Court considers it appropriate to observe that once the controversy has been finally decided by the Division Bench, it must be applicable in rem to all similarly situated employees who are economically weaker section of the society and the respondents are further directed to consider candidature of all such persons similarly situated in terms of the judgment of Division Bench (supra). 
</p><p id="p_10">In light of order passed by Single Bench with modification made by Division Bench vide judgments (supra), writ petition is accordingly disposed of. Petitioner is also entitled mutatis mutandis for same benefits as granted by Division Bench of this Court vide judgment dated 01.10.2010 (supra) - for which he may submit fresh representation to competent authority who may examine his grievance in the light of judgment (supra) and pass a speaking order in accordance with law within two months thereafter.
