<p id="p_1">		By
	way of this petition the petitioner has prayed for the directions,
	directing the Respondent to grant promotion in favor of the
	petitioner to the post of Executive Engineer by considering the
	Resolution dated 4.8.2007 and further to direct the Respondent no.1
	to complete the departmental inquiry prescribed under the resolution
	dated 20.7.1993 framed by the Respondent no.2
	 


	  


		The
	fact of the case are as under:-
</p>	 

<p id="p_2">2.1	The
	petitioner was appointed on 5.1.1978 as a Assistant Engineer at
	Bayad for Vatrak Project Canal Sub Division II in Respondent no.1
	Department. The petitioner was promoted to the post of Deputy
	Executive Engineer on 7.7.1984.
</p>	 


	 

<p id="p_3">2.2
		The petitioner was issued a show-cause notice for his
	irregularities on 31.1.2007, which was replied by the petitioner on
	28.2.2007. After about two and half years, petitioner received
	charge sheet on 9.6.2009 and the same was replied to by the
	petitioner on 27.8.2009. 
</p>	
	 



 

<p id="p_4">	2.3	
The departmental promotion committee was met on	6.12.2008 and on
24.12.2008. The name of the petitioner	was put up in a  sealed cover
only on the ground that the	Departmental inquiry was pending against
the petitioner.	The petitioner personally went to the office of
Respondent	no.1 and  made  a request to open the seal cover
and	promote 	the	petitioner as an Executive Engineer by	showing the
Resolution dated 4.8.2007 issued by the	respondent no.2. However, no
promotion was given to the	petitioner. Hence this  petition.
</p> 

 


 

   
<p id="p_5">3.	
	Heard learned advocates for the respective parties and 	perused the
documents.
</p> 

 


 
	  


<p id="p_6">		From
	the record it revealed that prima facie the petitioner is entitled
	for the promotion, but due to the departmental inquiry, the
	authority had withheld his promotion. In my view, end of justice
	will met if the following order is passed.
</p>	 

 
<p id="p_7">	The
	Government will complete the departmental inquiry within a period of
	six moths from today, i.e.   on or before 3rd September
	2010. If the Government has failed to take a decision by that date
	then, the petitioner will be entitled for getting benefit of
	promotion which has been granted by Respondent no.2  
	 


	  


		With
	above directions petition stands disposed of.  
</p>
