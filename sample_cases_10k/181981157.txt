<p id="p_11">          In the present writ petition, the petitioner is challenging the

   order of termination vide Memo No. 104 dated 23.01.2017 (Annexure

</p><p id="p_12">   16) passed by Regional Deputy Director of Education, Tirhut

   Division, Muzaffarpur, in exercise of power conferred under Rule -

   14(xi) of the Bihar Government Servant (Classification, Control and

   Appeal) Rules, 2005. The petitioner is also challenging the order

   dated 14.09.2017, passed by the Appellate Authority i.e. Director,

   Secondary Education, Government of Bihar, Patna, who refused to
 Patna High Court CWJC No.7118 of 2017 dt.29-08-2018

        interfere with the order of dismissal, affirmed the same.

</p><p id="p_13">                Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the petitioner

        was arrested in connection with Vigilance P.S. Case No. 5/2016 on

        account of bribery along with one Alok Kumar and both of them are

        facing criminal trial under Sections 7, 8, 13(2) read with Section 13(1)

</p><p id="p_14">        (d) of the <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_1">Prevention of Corruption Act</a> and side by side a

        departmental proceeding was also initiated against the petitioner,

        whereafter order of punishment of dismissal from service has been

        passed which was challenged in appeal unsuccessfully. He further

        submits that in the departmental proceeding same mistake as in the

        case of Alok Kumar has been committed during enquiry as they have

        not brought evidence in terms of law rather in ipsi dixit and

        perfunctory manner enquiry has been           conducted and order of

        dismissal has been passed. It has also been submitted, the case of

        petitioner is identical to the case of Alok Kumar. In this case, Enquiry

        Officer has submitted the inquiry report before the date fixed for

        arguments from both sides. Same anomaly has also taken place like in

        the case of Alok Kumar and this Court has quashed the order of

        Disciplinary Authority as well as of Appellate Authority accordingly

        remanded back the same.

                 given the same benefit as has been given to Alok Kumar in terms of

                 order passed in C.W.J.C. No. 8601 of 2017.
</p>
<p id="p_16">                          Accordingly, the order of termination dated 23.01.2017 as well

                 as the order of Appellate Authority dated 14.09.2017 are quashed and

                 the matter is remanded back to the Enquiry Officer to conduct the

                 enquiry in a fare, proper and transparent manner after following the

                 procedure provided in Rule 17 of the Bihar Government Servant

                 (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules, 2005. The Disciplinary

                 Authority shall take decision in accordance with law. It goes without

                 saying that the petitioner will be entitled to subsistence allowance.

                 Any payment will be subject to outcome of the departmental

                 proceeding.
