 UCO Bank Vs. Abdul Wahid &amp; Ors.                          Judgement dt. 2.5.2015

       (Acquisition and <a href="/doc/984780/" id="a_1">Transfer of Undertaking) Act</a>, 1970 and present 
       suit has been filed by Sh. R. L. Singla, Senior Manager, who is 
       authorized to file the present suit.
</p><p id="p_2">   2.           It is stated by the plaintiff that defendants in the month of 
       February,   2005   approached   the   plaintiff   bank   for   availing 
       financial   facilities.     On   the   request   made   by   defendants   the 
       plaintiff bank agreed to advance a sum of Rs.8,85,000/­ lacs as 
       term loan to the defendants under loan term agreement.   The 
       defendant   no.1   and   3   executed   the   loan   documents   i.e. 
       agreement, letter of guarantee, declaration, mortgage deed etc. 
       The defendants did not deposit the payments as per the agreed 
       terms and conditions towards the loan facilities availed by them. 
       The various payments towards the repayment of term loan were 
       not   made   by   them.     The   plaintiff   bank   demanded   the 
       outstanding   amount   from   the   defendants   from   time   to   time, 
       however, defendants showed their inability to pay the same. As 
       per   statement   of   account,   an   amount   of   Rs.9,76,913/­   is   due 
       towards defendants which they have failed to pay.   Hence, the 
       plaintiff has filed the present suit for recovery of Rs.9,76,913/­ 
       against   the   defendants   along   with   pendente   lite   and   future 
       interest at the rate of 13.5% per annum from the date of filing

</p><p id="p_3">   3.           In  the present  case  the  defendants  have  been  served by 
       way of publication but despite that defendants did not appear 
       hence   defendants   were   proceeded   ex­parte   vide   order   dated 
       26.5.2009.

       plaintiff bank appeared as PW1 and filed his evidence by way of 
       affidavit as Ex.PW1/A.  He has reiterated the facts as mentioned 
       in   the   plaint   and   proved   the   copy   of   GPA   in   his   favour   as 
       Ex.PW1/1,   copy   of   agreement   as   Ex.PW1/2,   copy   of   the 
       promissory   note   as   Ex.PW1/3,     copy   of   the   form   A­47   as 
       Ex.PW1/4, copy of the Letter of Guarantee as Ex.PW1/5, copy of

</p><p id="p_5">   5.           I have considered the arguments advanced, evidence led 
       by   the   plaintiff   and   material   on   record.     In   the   present   case 
       testimony of the plaintiff is uncontroverted and unchallenged  as 
       in the present case defendants have opted not to appear in the 
       present case.

 UCO Bank Vs. Abdul Wahid &amp; Ors.                                Judgement dt. 2.5.2015

       plaintiff did not place on record the power of attorney in favour 
       of Sh. R. K. Singla, Senior Manager authorizing him to file the 
       suit as well as on the ground that PW1 did not have authority to 
       testify on behalf of plaintiff bank.  
</p><p id="p_7">   7.           The plaintiff bank filed a review petition stating that the 
       Managers   of   the   concerned   branches   of   UCO   Bank   are 
       authorized   to   institute   the   suit.     This   authorization   has   been 
       given   vide   a   resolution   no.10   of   the   Board   of   Directors   on 
       3.9.1980. Accordingly, Sh. R. K. Singla,  Senior Manager, UCO 
       Bank,   Shahdra   Branch,   Delhi,   who   had   signed   the   plaint   is 
       authorized   to   file   the   suit.     The   certified   copy   of   the   said 
       resolution was filed in the review petition.  In view of this fact, 
       the review petition was allowed.
</p><p id="p_8">   8.           Although   the   power   of   attorney   Ex.PW1/1   in   favour   of 
       plaintiff does not authorize him to testify as a witness. However, 
       I   agree   with   Ld.   Counsel   for   plaintiff   that   he   is   a   witness   of 
       records   and   accordingly   does   not   require   any   specific 
       authorization by the bank to testify in the court.   The fact that 
       he had been summoned at the request of the plaintiff bank, is 
       itself enough to prove that he had authority to testify and prove 
       the requisite record.
