                      JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">     The material facts of the prosecution case disclose that

the father of accused No.9 was murdered by the deceased,

PW.1 - complainant, PW2 and others earlier to the incident

about in September 2005. The charge-sheet was also filed

against the deceased, PW1, PW2 and others for committing

the murder. Therefore, the accused No.9 was bearing grouse
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                   8</span>




against the deceased. On 19.9.2006 around 6.00 a.m., the

deceased was doing morning walk in the Stadium at Hassan.

The accused No.9 along with his brothers accused Nos.1 and

3 and relatives and friends, wielding deadly weapons, came to

the    Stadium   and   they   indiscriminately      assaulted   the

deceased. The accused No.9 said to have assaulted the

deceased with a sword on his head and other parts of the

body    indiscriminately.   The   other   accused    stabbed    the

deceased with daggers and some of the accused assaulted

him with choppers. The deceased on account of the injuries

collapsed.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">       2.    PW1 who is the complainant claims that he was

also in the stadium and he was walking about 10 feet behind

the deceased and he witnessed the incident. In the complaint,

it is further stated that PW2 and DW1 came to the scene

couple of minutes after the accused fled away after the

assault. The complaint is registered at 7.45 a.m. The inquest

is conducted on the same day between 9.30 a.m. to 12.30
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                               9</span>




p.m. In the course of investigation, PW2 and DW1 have been

projected as eye-witnesses to the incident. The dead body is

subjected postmortem. Autopsy report discloses that the

death is homicide on account of shock and haemorrhage as a

result of multiple injuries. The accused are charged for

committing the offences punishable U/Ss.341, 302, 506 r/w.

Secs.120-B, 143, 147, 148 of <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_8">IPC</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_4">
</p><p id="p_5">     3.    In the evidence, the prosecution has examined

PW1 - complainant who testifies to the fact that he is an

eyewitness to the incident. PW2 who is examined also testifies

to the fact that he is an eyewitness to the incident. The other

eyewitness PW3 has turned hostile and does not support

prosecution case. One more eyewitness CW28 is given up by

the prosecution and examined as DW1 by the defence and he,

in his evidence, states that he never visited the scene and he

has not witnessed any incident. The Trial Court on the basis

of evidence of PWs.1 and 2 coupled with postmortem report,

has convicted A1 to A9 for the offences they are charged with
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                               10</span>




and A10 to A13 are acquitted for want of evidence. The

convicted accused have filed appeal. The State has filed

appeal against acquittal to A11 to A13 and also for

enhancement of sentence to death penalty in respect of A1 to

A9. No appeal is filed against A10.
</p>
<p id="p_6">
</p><p id="p_7">     4. Sri.C.V.Nagesh, learned Senior Counsel, submitted

the following circumstances to assail the order of conviction.

</p><p id="p_8">     (a)   PW.1 who claims to be an eyewitness is a

concocted witness. It is not in dispute that PW.1 was

suffering from liver cirrhosis for the past couple of years and

he was admitted to Manipal hospital at Manipal three days

earlier to the incident as an inpatient. In the cross-

examination of PW.1, he admits that he got discharged from

Manipal hospital on 18.9.2006 in the afternoon and while

coming by bus from Mangalore to go to Hassan, he developed

severe pain and bleeding. Therefore, he got down at Suratkal

and got admitted in Padmavathi hospital. He was discharged

on 19.9.2006 around 7.00 a.m. Exs.D1 and D2 are the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                               11</span>




hospital records of Padmavathi hospital which disclose

admission of PW.1 to the hospital on 18.9.2006 at 4.30 p.m.

and discharge on 19.9.2006 at 7.00 a.m. The said documents

and the admission of PW.1 in his cross-examination would

belie the fact that he was an eyewitness to the incident which

occurred around 6.30 a.m. at Hassan. The distance between

Suratkal and Hassan is 200 kms., and that the travelling time

is around 6 hours as admitted by PW.1.
</p>
<p id="p_9">
</p><p id="p_10">     5.    PW.1 at one stage of the cross-examination states

that he got discharged from Manipal hospital on 18.9.2006 at

2.30 p.m. and comes to Mangalore, takes the bus at 8.30

p.m. to Hassan and reaches Hassan 2.45 a.m and comes to

his native village Gyaralli at 3.00 a.m. It is argued that even

this version of the evidence of PW.1 is not credible because a

patient who is discharged after treatment for liver cirrhosis,

when he reaches home at 3.00 a.m., it would be improbable

for him to go to Hassan from his village at 6.00 a.m. without

taking any rest.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                               12</span><p id="p_11">




</p><p id="p_12">     (b)   PW.1    has   been      partly   cross-examined   on

21.7.2009. The cross-examination was deferred. Thereafter,

PW.1 is not tendered for cross-examination. Therefore,

evidence of PW.1 is to be rejected on that count.


</p><p id="p_13">     (c)   The evidence of PW.1 discloses that although he

was accused of murdering the father of A9, there was a

compromise between the families of A9 and the deceased and

thereafter, there was no issue between them and that they

were in cordial terms. Therefore, the motive projected by the

prosecution gets belied by the evidence of PW.1.


</p><p id="p_14">     (d)   PW.1 in the course of cross-examination was

asked to identify the accused persons in the dock. PW.1

commits the mistake of identifying A8 as A3 and A12 as A11

and again A3 as A11. PW.1 does not identify A9 and states

that A9 was not one of the assailants and not present at the

scene.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                      13</span><p id="p_15">




</p><p id="p_16">     (e)    The complaint Ex.P1 marked disclose that PW.2

comes to the scene after the incident and when the accused

had fled away. The investigating agency has padded up the

case and projected PW.2 as eyewitness to the incident. The

claim of the PW.2 as an eyewitness to the incident is

incredible because of contents of FIR -Ex.P41 which clearly

disclose that PW.2 and DW.1 arrive at scene sometime after

the incident and after the accused had fled away. Therefore,

PW.2 is a concocted eyewitness.
</p>
<p id="p_17">
</p><pre id="pre_2">     (f)    The     recovery        of     weapons    is   a    concocted

circumstance. All     the panch witnesses have turned hostile

</pre><p id="p_18">and does not support the case of the prosecution.


</p><p id="p_19">     (g)    One of the witnesses PW.41 in his evidence admits

some Doctors and Lawyers were walking in the Stadium at

the time of incident and he has examined and recorded their

statements.   But    none      of        the   eyewitnesses    have   been

examined.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                  14</span><p id="p_20">




</p><p id="p_21">       (h)   The     FIR   although   registered   on   7.45   a.m.,

according to PW33, the FIR reaches the Magistrate at 2.45

p.m.    The Police Station and the Court is at a distance of

1000 feet and the residence of the Magistrate is also is less

than a furlong and does not take ten to fifteen minutes walk

to reach. The delay in submitting the FIR to the Court would

only create doubt. In the context of above discrepancies, it

only suggested that registration of FIR is ante-time and

concocted to show PW.1 who is brother of the deceased as an

eyewitness to the incident.

pointed out that timing of the inquest is tampered and the

time    at   which    inquest   commenced     and   concluded     is

interpolated.

</p><p id="p_25">       (j)   In view of the above discrepancies, Sri.C.V.Nagesh,

learned Senior Counsel, strenuously argued that the order of

conviction recorded by the Trial Court is contrary to the

evidence on record and therefore, liable to be set-aside.

</p><p id="p_26">     6.    The learned High Court Government Pleader

strenuously argued that the evidence of PW.1 is a credible

evidence and the fact that panch witnesses to the recovery

have turned hostile is of no consequence as police officers

have supported the case of the prosecution. The FSL report

supports the case of the prosecution. It shows that the blood

stains on the weapon tally with the blood group of the

deceased found on the clothing of the deceased. The post-

mortem report corroborate the version of the prosecution

about the ghastly murder committed by the accused with

deadly weapons like dagger, knife, chopper etc., Since the

murder is a daylight murder, the punishment of life

imprisonment is inadequate and that the accused have to be

awarded death sentence. The acquittal of A11 to A13 is also

untenable because PWs1 and 2 in their evidence clearly

implicate A11 to A13 and there is no ground to disbelieve

their evidence.

</p><p id="p_28">     7.    Upon thorough consideration of the facts and

evidence   and the submissions made           at the   Bar, the

discrepancies   pointed    out     by   the   Senior    Counsel

Sri.C.V.Nagesh are really evident from the record. The

presence of PW.1 at the scene becomes doubtful to be

believed. PW.1 in his evidence admits that he was discharged

from Padmavathi Hospital on 19.9.2006.        The incident has

happened earlier to discharge from Padmavathi Hospital.

Therefore, his presence at the scene is impossible. The other

version of PW.1 that he got discharged from Manipal Hospital,

Manipal, came to Mangalore, took bus at 8.30 p.m. and

reached Hassan at 2.30 a.m. and reached his village Gyaralli

at 3.00 a.m., even if considered, his presence at the scene

cannot be believed because he had taken treatment for liver

cirrhosis. Gyaralli village is about 6 kms., from Hassan. It is

improbable for a patient suffering from liver cirrhosis, after

discharge, reaches the village and within hours and in the

morning goes to the stadium for a walk is an unthinkable

proposition.

</p><p id="p_30">     8.    The claim of PW.2 that he is an eyewitness to the

incident gets belied by the contents of Ex.P1. The FIR

discloses that PW.2 and DW.1 arrive at the scene after couple

of minutes after the incident and by that time, the accused

had fled away. The statement of PW.2 is recorded belatedly

two days after the incident in which he claims to be an

eyewitness to the incident which is again contrary to the

contents of Ex.P1.
</p>
<p id="p_31">
</p><p id="p_32">     9.    On a thorough analysis, the entire case of the

prosecution hinges upon the evidence of PWs1 and 2. PW1 in

the complaint names only seven accused with overt acts. In

the course of investigation, six more accused have been

implicated. The evidence on record clearly shows that at every

stage the investigation is padded up and concocted. The claim

of prosecution that PWs1 and 2 are eyewitness is incredible

and contrary to the evidence on record and the admission of

PW.1 in his cross-examination. If the evidence of PWs1 and 2

is to be ignored, there appears to be no other credible
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                                 18</span>




evidence to convict the accused. Even with regard to motive,

PW.1 says that although the father of A9 was murdered and

himself, deceased, PW.2 and others were also accused, there

was a compromise and the feud between the families had

vanished. There appears to be no motive for commission of

offence. There appears to be no evidence to show that the

accused persons have committed offence.
</p>
<p id="p_33">       Accordingly, Crl.A.No.968/2010 filed by the appellants-

accused Nos.1 to 9 is allowed and they are acquitted of all the

charges    leveled   against   them.   Crl.A.Nos.643/2011   and

642/2011 filed by the State are dismissed.
