                 ======================================================
                 CORAM: HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE MADHURESH PRASAD
                                       ORAL ORDER</pre>

<p id="p_1">2   06-05-2019                    Heard learned Counsel for the petitioner and the

                   learned Counsel for the State.
</p>
<p id="p_2">                               The petitioner was working as Accounts Assistant at

                   the district level office of Bihar Education Project Council. The

                   contractual engagement was done in the year 2011 for one year.

                   It has subsequently been renewed up till the year 2014. The

                   allegation of demand of Rs. 25,000/- for releasing funds for civil

                   construction of a school was attributed to the petitioner. The

                   same resulted in an enquiry report dated 7.5.2014.
 Patna High Court CWJC No.12731 of 2014(2) dt.06-05-2019
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                           2/3</span>




                      It is submitted by petitioner's counsel that the said

          enquiry report,        is without notice and without hearing the

          petitioner and, as such, the order terminating his contractual

          engagement dated 3.6.2014 is unsustainable in law. Placing

          reliance on another enquiry report, by a three men committee

          contained in Annexure F to the second supplementary counter

          affidavit, is is submitted that tone and tenure of the report of

          three men committee is that the petitioner was not responsible

          for the allegation which was earlier held to be proved by report

          dated 7.5.2014.
</p>
<p id="p_3">                      Counsel for the State submits that from perusal of

          Annexure F, it is evident that covering letter clearly stipulates

          that a final decision in respect of petitioner's role/responsibility

          into allegation alleged against him can be taken only upon

          conclusion of the police investigation which till issuance of the

          three men Enquiry report was still continuing.

</p><p id="p_4">                      Be that as it may, the admitted position is that the

          Enquiry report, dated 7.5.2014 which formed basis of

          termination of petitioner's contractual engagement was without

          hearing the petitioner. The civil consequences arising out of the

          said enquiry report, therefore are legally unsustainable as being

          violative of the principles of natural justice. This Court,
             Patna High Court CWJC No.12731 of 2014(2) dt.06-05-2019
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                                       3/3</span>




                      therefore, would hold that without casting any shadow on the

                      criminal investigation which is proceeding in the matter, the

                      petitioner should not be made to suffer any stigma on account of

                      the enquiry report, dated 7.5.2014.
</p>
<p id="p_5">                                  The writ petition is disposed of.
</p>
<p id="p_6">                                  If the petitioner is not disqualified on account of

                      pendency of the criminal proceeding then it will be open to the

                      authorities to consider his appointment on contractual basis

                      without placing reliance on the enquiry report, dated 7.5.2014.
