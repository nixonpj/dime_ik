                                     (2 of 3)             [SAW-70/2019]

05/02/2019

     By this special appeal, a challenge is made to the order

dated 22nd October, 2018, passed by learned Single Judge

dismissing the writ petition preferred by the petitioners. The writ

petition was filed to seek appointment on the post of Junior

Ayurved/Nurse Compounder, for which, an advertisement was

issued on 15th September, 2007.
</p>
<p id="p_2">     It was stated that despite repeated litigation by the

petitioners and others, the vacant posts of Junior Ayurved/Nurse

Compounder were not filled. The contempt petition was filed

followed by a review petition. The review petition was also

disposed of in the year 2017. Without delay, writ petition was

filed. Learned Single Judge yet dismissed the writ petition on the

ground of delay and even taking statement of respondents to be

true and correct regarding filling of the posts, though they are still

lying vacant.
</p>
<p id="p_3">     We have considered submission made by learned counsel for

appellant and perused the record.
</p>
<p id="p_4">     We find that pursuant to the advertisement dated 15 th

September, 2007, when all the posts were not filled, the

petitioners and others filed a writ petition bearing No.3842/2009.

It was disposed of by this court vide its order dated 1 st September,

2011. It was with a direction to give appointment to the

meritorious candidates, if any unfilled seats exist pursuant to the

advertisement dated 15th September, 2007. After the aforesaid

order, contempt petition was filed but withdrawn with liberty to file

an application for clarification of the order dated 1 st September,

2011. Subsequently, review petition was filed. It was also
                                                                          (3 of 3)           [SAW-70/2019]



                                   withdrawn with liberty to take other remedy, if permissible for a

                                   cause available to the petitioners.
</p>
<p id="p_5">                                        The present writ petition was again filed to seek direction for

                                   appointment against unfilled vacancies, for which, earlier writ

                                   petition was preferred in the year 2009 and decided vide order

                                   dated 1st September, 2011. The present writ petition has been

                                   filed for the same relief which was claimed in the earlier writ

                                   petition bearing No.3842/2009. The writ petition cannot be filed

                                   one after another for one and same relief, that too, between one

                                   and same party. If compliance of the earlier order was not made,

                                   the petitioners were having remedy of contempt and in fact, it was

                                   filed. The contempt petition was withdrawn with liberty to file an

                                   application for clarification of the order dated 1 st September, 2011.

</p><p id="p_6">                                        The present writ petition was then filed for the same relief,

                                   for which, earlier writ petition filed by the petitioners was disposed

                                   of by this court. The second writ petition was not maintainable. It

                                   is apart from grounds given by learned Single Judge. We dismiss

                                   the present special appeal on the aforesaid grounds without

                                   causing interference in the order passed by learned Single Judge.

</p><p id="p_7">                                        At this stage, learned counsel for appellants prayed for

                                   liberty to file an application for revival of the contempt petition.

                                   The liberty sought for is granted.
