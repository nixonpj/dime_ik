                      Mr. Goutam Mukherjee
                                ... For the respondent no.4</pre>

<p id="p_1">                      Mr. Q.A.M. Firoz
                      Mr. Tanmay Basu
                                 ... For the respondent no.5


                The subject matter of challenge in the writ petition is in

             respect of non-issuance of an order in favour of the

             petitioner for renewal of her contract for the post of

             Sahayika at Taragunia Shishu Shiksha Kendra, situated

             under Ward No.16, Baduria Municipality, District - North

             24-Parganas.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
                This matter was heard on several dates and reports in

             the form of affidavits have been filed on behalf of the

             Baduria Municipality as well as the Mission Director,

             Paschim Banga Rajya Shishu Shiksha Mission. It has been

             categorically stated by the concerned authority of Baduria

             Municipality that the Memo/Circular dated 28th August,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                          2</span>


2009, issued by the Principal Secretary to the Government

of    West   Bengal,   Panchayats   and      Rural     Development

Department, which is sought to be relied on by the

petitioner, was in respect of Panchayat areas only. The said

Circular is not applicable in respect of Municipal areas at

all. As such the Memo/Circular dated 28th August, 2009,

which pertains to age of Sahayikas, would have no manner

of application at all in respect of those working under a

Municipality in the post-in-question.
</p>
<p id="p_3">
</p><p id="p_4">     From the report in the form of an affidavit filed on behalf

of the Mission Director, Paschim Banga Rajya Shishu

Shiksha Mission, it appears that the petitioner was engaged

as Sahayika on a contract basis from year to year by the

Managing Committee of the Baduria Municipality, which

was    set   up   by   the   Municipal       Affairs   Department,

Government of West Bengal, and not by the Department of

Panchayats and Rural Development. The guideline issued by

the Panchayats and Rural Development Department is

applicable only in respect of Panchayat areas and not

applicable in respect of any Shishu Shiksha Kendra set up

by the Municipal Affairs Department. It has also been stated

by the Mission Director that the order of the Principal
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                         3</span>


Secretary to the Government of West Bengal, Panchayats

and Rural Development dated 28th August, 2009, being

annexure "P-4" at page 33 of the writ petition, is not

applicable in respect of Sahayikas/Sahayaks engaged by the

various municipalities, including Baduria Municipality.


   Considering the categorical statements made both on

behalf of the Baduria Municipality as well as the Mission

Director, Paschim Banga Rajya Shishu Shiksha Mission, it

is quite clear that the petitioner cannot avail of the benefit of

the Memo/Circular dated 28th August, 2009, which he has

sought to rely on in the writ petition. That apart, the

petitioner was in contractual appointment which cannot be

renewed as a matter of right. The authorities have absolute

discretion in the matter and the writ Court cannot interfere,

unless   of   course,   there    is   palpable   perversity   or

arbitrariness. No such ingredients being present, there is no

scope of interference in the instant matter. The writ petition

is liable to be dismissed and is accordingly dismissed.


   Urgent photostat certified copy of this order, if applied

for, be given to the learned advocates for the parties.
