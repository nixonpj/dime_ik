TO SET ASIDE THE ORDER OF CAT BANGALORE
PASSED IN OA.NO.983-985/12 DT.2.7.13, VIDE ANN-A
&amp;   DIRECT    FURTEHR    DIRECTION      TO   THE
RESPONDENTS     TO   RESTORE    THE     BENEFITS
GRANTED EARLIER.

     These writ petitions coming on for preliminary
hearing this day, N. KUMAR, J. passed the following:-

                            ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">     These petitions are preferred against the order

passed by the Central Administrative Tribunal which

has declined to interfere with the order passed by the

authorities directing recovery of the amount paid to the

petitioners erroneously under the MACP scheme.


</p><p id="p_2">     2.     The petitioners-applicants were appointed as

Sorting   Assistants   in    the     establishment    of   the

Superintendent, Railway Mail Service,           Q Division,

Bangalore   on    23.5.1977,       8.1.1978   and   16.9.1978

respectively.    The next promotion from the post of

Sorting Assistants is to Lower Selection Grade(in short

"LCG") and further promotion is to Higher Selection

Grade I and II(in short "HSG I AND II"). The applicants
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                              4</span>




were promoted regularly to the cadre of LSG on

11.12.2007, 27.12.2007 and 27.12.2007 respectively.

However, they declined promotion. The Superintendent

of Railway Mail Service, Q Division, Bangalore-3rd

respondent   herein   granted    the    MACP-III   financial

benefit with effect from 1.9.2008 and 29.9.2008 to the

first two petitioners-applicants. The third applicant also

got similar benefit later.       They were given MACP

financial benefit vide Memo dated 18.6.2010 and

22.8.2011 respectively. However, after noticing that the

said financial upgradation was         given erroneously, a

show-cause notice was issued to them for withdrawal of

financial upgradation and recover the amount covered

by financial upgradation. The applicants sent their

reply. After considering their reply the third respondent

passed an order dated 15.10.2012 withdrawing the

upgradation benefit which was granted w.e.f. 1.9.2008,

1.9.2008 and 29.9.2008 and ordered recovery of the

benefit as a result of financial upgradation. Challenging
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                         5</span>




the said order, they preferred an application before the

Tribunal      contending that               even though they have

declined the promotion, as financial upgradation was

granted, the same cannot be withdrawn. The Tribunal

by an elaborate order after considering the various

judgments has held that once the petitioners declined

the promotion they were not entitled to financial

upgradation and their financial upgradation under the

Scheme was given without noticing that                            they      were

granted       promotion           and        they     had        declined     to

accept       the   promotion         and        therefore,        they      were

not     entitled      to     financial         upgradation          and      the

benefit      accruing        there          from.      Relying       on      the

judgment of the Apex Court they held that this is

a     case    where        even    though           there   is     no     fraud

or misrepresentation on the part of the petitioners, as

public money is involved, the order directing recovery of

said amount is lawful and they declined to interfere with
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                6</span>




the said order.        Aggrieved by the said order, these

petitions are filed.
</p>
<p id="p_3">
</p><p id="p_4">      3.       The learned counsel for the petitioners

submits that even if it is held that they were not entitled

to financial upgradation on account of their refusal to

receive the promotion, one of them had already retired,

two of them are on the verge of retirement and therefore,

it is a case of hardship that would be caused to the

petitioners.    The judgment of the Apex Court has no

application and it falls within the exception made out in

the very same judgment. Therefore, he submits that a

case for interference is made out.
</p>
<p id="p_5">
</p><pre id="pre_2">      4.       The     Government    of    India    by    its

communication        dated   24.8.2012    has   categorically

</pre><p id="p_6">stated the effect of refusal of regular promotion before

becoming entitled to a financial upgradation under the

MACP Scheme. With particular reference to Para 25 at

Annexure-I to the Departmental letter it is made clear
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                            7</span>




that if a regular promotion had been offered but was

refused by the employee before becoming entitled to a

financial upgradation, no financial upgradation shall be

allowed as such an employee has not been stagnated

due to lack of opportunities.    If, however, financial

upgradation has been allowed due to stagnation and the

employees subsequently refused the promotion, it shall

not be a ground to withdraw the financial upgradation.

He shall, however, not be eligible to be considered for

further financial upgradation till he agrees to be

considered for promotion again and the second and the

next financial upgradation shall also be deferred to the

extent of period of debarment due to refusal.       The

ACP/MACP Schemes are being operated as safety net to

deal with the problem of genuine stagnation and

hardship faced by the employees due to lack of

adequate promotional avenues.     In case an employee

has refused promotion, no financial upgradation is

allowed under ACP/MACP Schemes.         Para 25 of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                               8</span>




MACP scheme is a policy decision of the Government

with regard to the effect of refusal of regular promotion

on the operation of the Scheme. Any relaxation in the

matter may not therefore be possible in deviation of the

provisions of the Scheme.           In the instant case,

admittedly,   the    petitioners   declined   their   regular

promotion on 11.12.2007, 27.12.2007 and 27.12.2007.

The Scheme came into force from 1.9.2008 and

29.10.2008. The scheme was as a safety net to deal with

the problem of genuine stagnation and hardship faced

by the employees due to lack of adequate promotional

avenues   and   in    case   an    employee    has    refused

promotion, the scheme has no application.             Para 25

made it very clear that if the regular promotion had

been offered but was refused by the employee before

becoming entitled to financial upgradation, no financial

upgradation shall be allowed as such an employee has

not been stagnated due to lack of opportunities.

Therefore, this is not a case where the said scheme is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                             9</span>




applicable to the petitioners. The petitioners were given

promotion, they declined. The scheme is meant to cases

where there were no promotional avenues at all. In that

view of the matter, when the scheme was made

applicable to the petitioners and they were given

financial upgradation, it is without authority of law. In

that view of the matter, the authorities after considering

the petitioners case have rightly passed an order

withdrawing the amounts paid in lieu of financial

upgradation. The said order is legal and valid and does

not call for interference. Though the Apex Court in the

case of Chandi Prasad Uniyal and others .vs. State

of Uttarkhand and others [AIR 2012(8) SCC 417]

has held that any amount paid/received without

authority of law always be recovered barring few

exceptions of extreme hardships but not as a matter of

right and in such situations law implies an obligation

on the payee to repay the money, otherwise it would

amount to unjust enrichment. In the facts of this case
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                             10</span>




we are satisfied that as the payment was made without

authority of law and it represents the tax payers money

it belongs neither to the petitioners nor to the persons

who paid the said amount. Even in the absence of any

mistake on the part of the petitioners, they should not

have accepted the said amount as it was not legitimately

due to them. In that view of the matter, the Tribunal

was justified in not interfering with the said order.


</p><p id="p_7">     5.    No merits. The writ petitions are dismissed.
