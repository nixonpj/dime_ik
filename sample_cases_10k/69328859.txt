(By Shri. C.H. Jadhav, Senior Advocate)

                                *****

      This Criminal Appeal filed under <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_7">Section 374(2)</a> of the
code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, by the advocate for the
appellant against the judgment dated 21.6.2004 passed by the
XXI Additional City Civil and Sessions Judge and Special
Judge for CBI Cases, Bangalore in Spl.C.C.No.139 of 1998 -
convicting the appellant/accused No.2 for the offences

Indian Penal Code, 1860 and etc;

       These appeals having been heard and reserved on
13.06.2013 and coming on for pronouncement of Judgment
this day, the Court delivered the following:-


                         JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">        These   appeals are   heard and disposed of by this

common judgment as they are filed by the accused in the same

case.
</p>
<p id="p_2">        2.   The appellant in the first of these appeals was

arraigned as accused no.1 (Hereinafter referred to as 'A.1', for

brevity) and the appellant in the second of these appeals is

arraigned as accused no.2 (Hereinafter referred to as 'A.2', for
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                 4</span>




brevity). A.1 was employed as the Branch Manager, Vijaya

Bank, Chickpet Branch, Bangalore during the period 1989 to

1993. A.2 was an excise contractor, who had an account with

the said branch of Vijaya Bank. It is the case of the prosecution

that A.1 and A.2 had entered into a criminal conspiracy and

had committed forgery by fabricating bogus bank guarantees,

purportedly furnished by Vijaya Bank, Chickpet Branch

favouring the Deputy Commissioner of Excise, Gulbarga, on

behalf of A.2. On the basis of such bank guarantees, it is

alleged that A.2 had been enabled to participate in the excise

auctions for general vending of arrack at Jewargi Taluk,

Gulbarga District and thereby earned huge monetary benefit,

which was allegedly shared with A.1 and caused corresponding

loss to the bank.
</p>
<p id="p_3">
</p><p id="p_4">      3.   It was the further case of the prosecution that in

furtherance of the conspiracy, A.1, by abusing        his official

position, did not record the particulars of the bank guarantees so
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                               5</span>




furnished on behalf of A.2, namely, Bank Guarantee

Nos.3/1989 dated 5.7.1989 for a sum of Rs.5,60,000/-, 2/1991

dated 15.7.1991 for a sum of Rs.23,31,200/-, 4/1992 dated

20.7.1992 for Rs.18,16,000/-, and 5/1992 dated 20.7.1992 for

a sum of Rs.90,800/-, which were required to be entered in the

Bank Guarantee Register maintained at the bank. It was further

alleged that A.1 obtained the loan application for the bank

guarantees from A.2 and processed it himself and forwarded it

to the Zonal Office of Vijaya Bank for sanction. But before the

same was sanctioned, the bank guarantees had been issued to

A.2 and there was no record maintained in the bank as to the

collection of commission, from A.2, towards the issuance of

such bank guarantees.    It was also alleged     that A.2 had

collected the aforesaid four bank guarantees on two occasions

from the Excise Department, Gulbarga, on the pretext that the

same would be returned to the Vijaya Bank and had managed to

destroy the same. It was also alleged that A.1 collected the

commission for the issuance of the bank guarantees and did not
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                               6</span>




credit it into the bank's account and A.1 had deliberately

destroyed the official correspondence carried on by the excise

authorities with the bank relating to the issue of bank

guarantees.   It is on the basis of the preliminary inquiry

conducted, that a case was registered against the accused for

offences punishable under <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_13">Sections 120-B</a> read with 420, 468,

471, 477A and       201<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_14"> of the Indian Penal Code</a>, 1860

(Hereinafter referred to as the '<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_15">IPC</a>', for brevity) and <a href="/doc/1259316/" id="a_16">Section

13(2)</a> read with <a href="/doc/1101716/" id="a_17">Section 13(1)(d)</a> of the Prevention of

Corruption Act, 1998 (Hereinafter referred to as the '<a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_18">PC Act</a>',

for brevity) and further proceedings had been taken through the

court. A search was carried out of the residential premises of

A.1 and certain documents      were seized and after further

proceedings, a charge sheet was filed against A.1 and A.2.

Thereafter, charges having been framed, the prosecution had

examined 14 witnesses and marked 54 documents.             The

statement of the accused under <a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_19">Section 313</a> of the Code of

Criminal Procedure, 1973 (Hereinafter referred to as the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                               7</span>




'<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_20">Cr.PC</a>', for brevity) was recorded and the parties were heard.

The    court below has framed       the following points for

consideration :-

      by corrupt or illegal means, abused his official
      position and committed criminal misconduct and
      entered into criminal conspiracy with A.2 and
      agreed to do illegal acts by illegal means and
      committed forgery and fabricated bogus bank
      guarantees in favour of Dy. Commissioner of
      Excise, Gulbarga and the bogus bank guarantees in
      the name of A.2 were furnished before the Excise
      Authorities   at   Gulbarga   as   genuine   bank
      guarantees and A.2 participated in the Excise
      Auction for general vending of arrack at Jewargi

the Vijaya Bank, Chickpet branch and thereby A.1
and A.2 have committed an offence punishable
under <a href="/doc/1897847/" id="a_21">Section 120B</a> of the Indian Penal Code?
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_2">      2. Does prosecution further prove that A.1
during the said period referred to above, in

Excise, Gulbarga in the name of A.2 and A.1
issued the four bank guarantees without recording
the particulars in the bank guarantee register

particulars of these bank guarantees in the bank
guarantee register maintained in the branch and
A.2 in turn furnished the bank guarantees before
the Excise authorities at Gulbarga as stated above

to have been issued by Vijaya Bank, Chickpet
Branch on 15/7/1989 for Rs.5,60,000/- favouring
Deputy Commissioner of Excise, Gulbarga, but the
bank guarantee register of Vijaya Bank, Chickpet

collected through A.2 the bank guarantees from the
Deputy Commissioner's office at Gulbarga and

destroyed the four bank guarantees and other
correspondence to conceal the fact of issuance of

</p>
<p id="p_8">
</p><p id="p_9">      4. The learned Senior Advocate Shri Ravi B Naik,

appearing for the counsel for the appellant in the first of these

appeals, contends that the court below has glossed over      the

fact that   there was no legal sanction accorded to prosecute

A.1. It is pointed out that the prosecution had submitted a

circular dated 7.9.2002 to establish that appropriate sanction

was accorded by the sanctioning authority.        However, the

witness PW.1 on behalf of the prosecution, namely, the Deputy

General Manager, Vijaya Bank, had in his cross-examination,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                               15</span>




agreed that till his termination from service in March 2001,

A.1 was continued as being appointed by the Chairman of the

bank and it was such appointing authority alone who accords

sanction for the prosecution of his subordinates and       such

power could not be delegated. It is further pointed out that on

this aspect, the said witness was treated as a hostile witness

and had been cross-examined by the prosecution. The court

below having glossed over the same, though such an objection

had been raised at the earliest point of time and the matter

having been allowed to proceed further, to consider the

objection as to the sanction, after the entire evidence of the

prosecution had been tendered and the court below having

placed reliance    on certain circulars issued by the bank,

whereby the power to grant sanction for prosecution, having

been delegated and while also noticing the legal position that a

circular could not take the place of a rule or a regulation, has

proceeded to hold that it was for A.1 to have challenged the

circular before an appropriate forum and therefore, it was not
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                                16</span>




an issue that could be considered by the court below and has

held that the sanction could not be invalidated on account of the

objection that the sanction was invalid. Therefore, the learned

Senior Advocate would submit that the entire proceedings stand

vitiated and the appeal would have to be allowed on that sole

ground and the appellant be acquitted.
</p>
<p id="p_10">      Without prejudice     to the same, the learned Senior

Advocate would also contend that even on merits, the judgment

of the court below cannot be sustained for the following

reasons:
</p>
<p id="p_11">      The prosecution had failed to establish the charges with

reference to the documentary evidence. It is not in dispute that

the respondents had produced only photo copies of the so-called

documentary evidence.      The court below has overlooked the

same when it was a crucial aspect as the prosecution case

centered around the originals of Exhibits P.4, P.5 and P.8. This

was further significant in the background that though there

were allegations in respect of four alleged bank guarantees -
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">                                 17</span>




3/1989, 2/1991, 4/1992 and 5/1992, being fabricated bank

guarantees, the prosecution thought it fit to produce only the

photo copies of three bank guarantees, not including the bank

guarantee No.3/1989. This lacuna was fatal to the case of the

prosecution.     The allegation that the originals had been

destroyed by A.1 in connivance with A.2 and A.1 having been

transferred from the Chickpet branch of Vijaya Bank to the

Staff Training College, Gandhinagar, Bangalore during May

1993, there would have been no occasion for the appellant to

lay his     hands on the said bank guarantees        or any other

correspondence and especially, in the light of the fact that the

appellant was discharged on the charge of destruction of

documents and property.
</p>
<p id="p_12">          As regards    failure to register the alleged bank

guarantees in the concerned register, was not a duty cast on the

Branch Manager, but was a clerical chore routinely carried out

by the lower level staff and if there was a lapse in this regard, it
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                               18</span>




could not be attributed to the appellant, who was a Senior

Branch Manager.
</p>
<p id="p_13">      It is further pointed out that though the Investigating

Authority, in   its search report, has categorically stated of

having recovered the photo copies of two bank guarantees, it

is inexplicable that the prosecution had produced the photo

copies of three bank guarantees bearing initials of independent

witnesses and marked as Exhibits 38, 39 and 40 and there is no

explanation forthcoming as to the source, from which the photo

copy of the third bank guarantee was procured, when it was not

indicated in the search report.    And even more strangely,

Exhibits.P.4, P.5 and P.8 have been produced by the

prosecution, which did not bear any initials of independent

witnesses. This would throw a strong doubt and suspicion as

to the legality of the investigation carried out by the

prosecution.
</p>
<p id="p_14">       It is also pointed out that there was no indication of any

loss that had occasioned to the bank on account of the alleged
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">                                19</span>




conspiracy and the irregularities said to have been committed

by A.1 and A.2.
</p>
<p id="p_15">        The learned Senior Advocate would        take this court

extensively through the record, to demonstrate that the interest

of the bank was never jeopardized in the issuance of the bank

guarantees on behalf of A.2. He was a long standing customer

of the bank with adequate funds to his credit and there was no

risk, to which the bank was exposed at any point of time. The

two bank guarantees bearing nos.4/1992 and 5/1992 had been

regularly issued on behalf of A.2 and were not invoked during

their turn.   The commission payable to the bank had been

collected, which is a matter of record, except that, the same are

not entered in the Bank Guarantee Register maintained by the

bank.    It was pointed out that    insofar as other two bank

guarantees are concerned, in view of the inconsistency in the

investigating authority having, in its search report, referred to

only two bank guarantees,       it is highly doubtful as to the

manner in which      the prosecution has sought to foist the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">                                20</span>




additional bank guarantees, on the basis of which, wild

allegations   have been made. The fact that no loss had

occasioned to the bank, is endorsed by PW.4 and therefore, the

learned Senior Advocate would seek that the appellant be

acquitted.
</p>
<p id="p_16">
</p><p id="p_17">       5. The learned Counsel for A.2, in turn, would contend

that the case of the prosecution alleging that there was an

agreement between A.2 and A.1, in furtherance of which,

certain bank guarantees were fabricated, is an allegation

without the essential ingredients of <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_36">Section 120-B</a> being

satisfied.
</p>
<p id="p_18">        It was also necessary for the prosecution to establish

that even if there were any such allegedly forged bank

guarantees, it was necessary to further establish that the accused

had benefitted thereby. On the other hand, the witnesses for the

prosecution had themselves stated that there were no dues by

way of rentals payable by A.2 to the excise department, to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">                                21</span>




secure the due payment of which, the bank guarantees had been

issued. Therefore, the essential ingredients of <a href="/doc/1436241/" id="a_37">Section 420</a> of

the IPC was found lacking and this aspect of the matter has

been completely glossed over by the trial court.

</p><p id="p_19">      It is also contended that the allegation of forgery was

required to be established by tendering cogent evidence and

there was no evidence whatsoever to establish that A.2 had a

role in forging the bank guarantees. It is not the case of the

prosecution   that A.2 did not have sufficient funds in his

account or that he was not a man of means to provide security,

against which, the bank guarantees could have been issued.

The prosecution had also failed to plead and establish that there

was any official favour shown by A.1 towards A.2, especially

when A.2 had sufficient security in the bank and the interest of

the bank was never jeopardized and there is sufficient evidence

of the prosecution, in support of the fact that A.2 was a trust-

worthy customer of the bank with adequate funds. The said

bank guarantees were never invoked by the party to which it
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">                                 22</span>




had been furnished, indicating thereby that there was no fault

committed by A.2 at any point of time and the amounts covered

under the bank guarantees were all settled by A.2 and therefore,

the falsity of the case of the prosecution is glaring.

</p><p id="p_20">       In support of the above contentions, the learned Counsel

for A.2 would particularly draw attention to the evidence

tendered on behalf of the prosecution. As for instance, he

would draw attention to the testimony of the following

witnesses on the aspect that the bank had not suffered any

pecuniary loss:
</p>
<p id="p_21">      PW.2 - Jawahar L Rawell, an Officer, has, in his

deposition, at para -8 on Page 44, has admitted that A.2 had

approached him in the year 1995 and requested for original

documents of his properties submitted to the bank as security

for the bank guarantee. Further, that as there was no liability

of A.2 to the bank, the said witness had returned those

documents. That A.2 was a regular customer of the Chickpet

branch of the bank since 1988 and that when the loan
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">                                23</span>




documents were returned to A.2 in 1995, A.2 had huge amounts

in deposit at the Chickpet branch. Further, that if any party,

who had obtained a loan from the bank and due to the bank

without discharge, the bank had a right to adjust the amounts of

that party in the deposits towards any due to the bank.



</p><p id="p_22">      PW.3    - V.K.Gangadharaiah, Senior Manager, has, at

Para 14 at Page 50, admitted that as on the date of investigation

of the matter, insofar as Chickpet Branch was concerned, there

was no actual pecuniary loss to Vijaya Bank, but there was a

demand made by the excise department for compliance of the

bank guarantees.
</p>
<p id="p_23">

</p><p id="p_24">      PW.4 - H.Subhashchandra Shetty, Senior Branch

Manager, has, at Para 18 at Page 57, stated that Vijaya Bank,

Chickpet Branch had not sustained any financial loss            in

connection with the issue of bank guarantee on behalf of A.2.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">                                24</span>




</p><p id="p_25">      PW.8 - N.Eshwaran, an Officer at Vijaya Bank had , at

para 5 page 84, has admitted that in Exhibit P.2, at Column

No.13, it was mentioned that all previous liabilities of the bank

guarantee were cleared. That in Exhibit P.2, it was mentioned

that the bank guarantee cleared was for an amount of Rs.23.31

lakh. And that A.2 was an old customer of the Chickpet

branch.
</p>
<p id="p_26">      It is hence contended that the above statements of the

bank officials would indicate that the bank has not suffered any

loss, on account of the bank guarantees issued.


</p><p id="p_27">      The relationship and creditworthiness of A.2 with the

bank is also stated by the several witnesses thus:-


</p><p id="p_28">      PW.2 Jawahar L Rawell, an Officer, has, at Para 8 on

Page 44, admitted that A.2 approached him in the year 1995

and requested for original documents of his properties

submitted to the bank as security for the bank guarantee. That

there was no liability of A.2 to the bank and PW.2 had returned
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">                               25</span>




those documents of the properties of A.2. That A.2 was a

regular customer of the Chickpet branch of the bank.      The

witness has further stated that when he returned the      loan

documents to A.2 in 1995, he had substantial amounts in

deposit at Chickpet branch.
</p>
<p id="p_29">
</p><p id="p_30">      PW.4       H.Subhashchandra    Shetty,   Senior   Branch

Manager, has at Paras 16,17,18,19 at Pages 56 and 57, has

admitted that during the year 1987, A.2 had taken a bank

guarantee for Rs.4 lakh from the Chickpet branch in favour of

the excise department, Gulbarga and he had subsequently paid

that bank guarantee amount and the same was released. Even

in the year 1988, A.2 had taken        a bank guarantee for

Rs.10,85,000/- in favour of the excise department and the said

amount of bank guarantee was released as per the entry in

Exhibit P.3 - Register.
</p>
<p id="p_31">      PW.4, at Para-17, has admitted that in Exhibit D.2, he

had mentioned that Mr.Kamalakar Itamgampalli, on whose
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">                                 26</span>




behalf the bank guaratenee was issued, was one of the good

customers of the Chickpet Branch, having huge deposits with

the bank and as on that date, there was a deposit of

Rs.5,50,000/- in the name of A.2 and his family members in

V.CC-52/88 and 57/88.
</p>
<p id="p_32">       At Para 18, PW.4 has stated that, to his memory, A.2

had deposited the title deeds of his property as security for the

bank guarantee obtained for Rs.10,85,000/- earlier.           The

witness did not knew whether the deposit of those title deeds

were taken into account      for the issue of subsequent bank

guarantees by the Chickpet Branch. He has admitted that

Vijaya Bank, Chickpet Branch, had not sustained any financial

loss in connection with the issue of bank guarantee on behalf of

A.2.
</p>
<p id="p_33">       At para 19, it was admitted that it was true that as per the

entry in Exhibit P.3, the Chickpet Branch had issued a bank

guarantee for Rs.17, 32,125/- on behalf of A.2 and that the said
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">                                  27</span>




amount involved had been paid by A.2 in the month of May

1991.
</p>
<p id="p_34">        PW.8 - N.Eshwaran, at Para 5 on Page 84, has admitted

that in Exhibit P.2 at Column No.14, it was mentioned that all

the previous liabilities of the Bank Guarantee was cleared.

That in Exhibit P.2, it was mentioned that the bank guarantee

cleared was for an amount of Rs.23.31 lakh. That A.2 was an

old customer of the Chickpet Branch.
</p>
<p id="p_35">
</p><p id="p_36">        It is contended that the primary allegation that the fact of

the bank guarantees having been concocted, without the same

being shown in the records of the bank, by reference to the

circumstance that there was no evidence of the commission

payable on the bank guarantees having been paid to the bank.

This is negated by the statements of the witnesses for the

prosecution, namely , PW.8 and PW.13, thus:


</p><p id="p_37">        PW.8 - N.Eshwaran, has, in Paras 5 and 6 on Pages 84

and 85, admitted that in Exhibit.P.2 at Column No.14, it was
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">                                   28</span>




mentioned that all previous liabilities of the bank guarantee

were cleared. In Exhibit P.2, it was mentioned that the bank

guarantee cleared was for an amount             of Rs.23.31 lakh.

Further, the witness has deposed that A.2 was an old customer

of the Chickpet branch and that he had remitted Rs.38,336/- to

the bank as commission for the bank guarantee issued.


</p><p id="p_38">          PW.13 - Vittal Rao has admitted at para 4 on page 104,

that subsequently, A.2 had paid the commission pertaining to

bank guarantee nos.4/92 and 5/92.
</p>
<p id="p_39">
</p><p id="p_40">          The fact that A.2 had sufficient cash margin and security

by way of immoveable property, during the year 1988 to 1995,

is evidenced by the statements of the witnesses to the following

effect:
</p>
<p id="p_41">          PW.2 Jawahar L Rawell,        has, at para 8 on page 44

admitted that A.2 had approached him in the year 1995 and

requested for original documents of his properties submitted to

the bank as security for the bank guarantee. That as there was
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">                               29</span>




no liability of A.2 to the bank, he returned those documents.

That A.2 was a regular customer of the Chickpet branch since

1988. That PW.2 returned the loan documents to A.2 in 1995.

</p><p id="p_42">      PW.4 has admitted at Para 18 of his evidence, that

according to his memory, A.2       had deposited the title deeds

of his property as security for the bank guarantee obtained for

Rs.10,85,000/- earlier. The witness did not knew whether the

deposit of those title deeds were taken into account for the

issue of subsequent bank guarantees by the Chickpet Branch.

That Vijaya Bank, Chickpet Branch, had not sustained any

financial loss in connection with the issue of bank guarantee on

behalf of A.2.
</p>
<p id="p_43">       To substantiate that there was no loss occasioned to the

excise department, the following statements of the prosecution

witnesses are sufficient:-
</p>
<p id="p_44">      PW.4 has, in Paras 14 and 15 at pages 55 and 56,

admitted that he had received a letter from the office of the

Deputy Commissioner of Excise, Gulbarga, to the effect that
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">                                  30</span>




they had no claims against the bank guarantees pertaining to

the claim made in Exhibit P.6.
</p>
<p id="p_45">      Further in para 15, he had admitted that the carbon copy

of the letter dated 8.7.1995 was marked at Exhibit D.1. That in

Exhibit D.1, he had informed the Deputy General Manager,

Bangalore Zone,      that the Deputy Commissioner of Excise,

Gulbarga, under his letter dated 4.7.1995, informed the bank

that they had no claim against the bank. It was true that he had

requested the Deputy General Manager, Bangalore Zone, to

treat the matter as closed.
</p>
<p id="p_46">      PW.6 Suryakanth Sungar, has, in para 8 on page 72,

admitted that he had made a note after receiving the application

from A.2 that all the dues which were due to the department

were paid by A.2, and as such, he had made an endorsement to

the effect that the bank guarantee may be returned. That the

rental due under the Bank guarantee Nos.3/89, 2/91, 4/92 and

5/92 had been cleared by A.2 by July 1992 and as the party

also did not ask for the return of the Bank guarantees, as such
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_28">                               31</span>




till 1995, he did not return them and kept them in the

department.
</p>
<p id="p_47">      It is also contended that there is grave suspicion of the

genuineness of the seizure mahazar in relation to the copies of

the bank guarantees said to have been recovered        from the

home of A.2. It is pointed out that on 6.1.1998 at about 7.45

a.m., which is three years after the date on which the original

bank guarantees are said to have been returned, as stated by

PW.6 at page 68 of the paper book, namely on 25.8.1995, the

seizure having been conducted by the Police Inspector, Suresh

Kumar along with two witnesses, namely, S.Nagaraj and Vittal

Rao, the seizure mahazar at page-35 discloses that the photo

copy of the bank guarantee no.5/2 dated 20.7.1992 and 2/1991

dated nil were seized. The Police Officer - Suresh Kumar was

not examined as a witness       for the prosecution.    PW.11

S.Nagaraj, who was a panch witness, however, has stated that

four documents were seized from the house of A.2, as shown in

the search list. The other panch witnesses, Vittal Rao PW.12,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_29">                                  32</span>




in turn, has identified Exhibits P.38, 39 and 40, as being the

bank guarantees, that were seized from the house of A.2.

Therefore, there is no consistency       as to the number of

documents that were actually seized, as the seizure mahazar

indicates only two documents, whereas PW.11 speaks of four

documents and PW.12 speaks of three documents. Hence, no

reliance could be placed on the seizure mahazar.

</p><p id="p_48">      As regards the alleged fabrication of bank guarantees

having been proved beyond reasonable doubt is also not

tenable. In that, as regards Exhibits P.4,5 and 8 are concerned,

PW.3 and PW.5 had claimed that in their investigation, as per

Exhibit P.11 and P.9, respectively, they were unable to obtain

either the original or the photo copies of the bank guarantees.

PW.5 has categorically stated so at para-8 of his deposition in

the following words:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_8">               "It is true that PW.3 V.K.Gangadharaiah
         could not probe the allegation in the absence of
         the bank guarantees and the copies thereof and
         accordingly reported.   During my investigation,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_30">                                 33</span>




         the bank guarantees and the copies thereof could

   "11. In a case where the accused failed to raise
the question of valid sanction the trial would
normally proceed to its logical end by making a
judicial scrutiny of the entire materials. If that case
ends in conviction there is no question of failure of
justice on the mere premise that no valid sanction
was accorded for prosecuting the public servant
because the very purpose of providing such a
filtering check is to safeguard public servants from
frivolous or mala fide or vindictive prosecution on
the allegation that they have committed offence in
the discharge of their official duties. But once the
judicial filtering process is over on completion of
the trial the purpose of providing for the initial
sanction would bog down to a surplausage. This

sanction is obtained from the appropriate authority, if
the offence, alleged to have been committed, was in
discharge of the official duty. The Section not only
specifies the persons to whom the protection is
afforded but it also specifies the conditions and
circumstances in which it shall be available and the
effect in law if the conditions are satisfied. The
mandatory character of the protection afforded to a
public servant is brought out by the expression, 'no
court shall take cognizance of such offence except with
the previous sanction'. Use of the words, 'no' and
'shall' makes it abundantly clear that the bar on the
exercise of power of the court to take cognizance of
any offence is absolute and complete. The very
cognizance is barred. That is, the complaint cannot be
taken notice of. According to Black's law Dictionary
the word 'cognizance' means 'Jurisdiction' or 'the
exercise of jurisdiction' or 'power to try and determine
causes'. In common parlance, it means taking notice
of. A court, therefore, is precluded from entertaining a
complaint or taking notice of it or exercising

       He would then point out that error, omission or

irregularity of sanction not being material, is generally a

proposition, in the light of <a href="/doc/97670/" id="a_79">section 19</a> of the PC Act, to be

pressed into service, when no objection has been raised at the

earliest   stage of the proceedings and to save the findings

arrived at by the trial court after a full-fledged trial and the

judicial filtering process is over. In the instant case on hand,

however, it is on record that A.1 had raised a preliminary

objection as regards want of sanction and had continued to

press the same      through out. As already pointed out, PW.1

had, in so many words, conceded that he was not the appointing

authority of A.1, but had been delegated the power to grant

sanction for the prosecution under a Circular. The prosecution

had, in fact, treated him as a hostile witness on this aspect,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_48">                                 51</span>




thereby conceding that there was an admission of such want of

authority.
</p>
<p id="p_85">      He would further contend that on the second limb as to

whether there is occasion of failure of justice on account of

such an invalid sanction is concerned, the glaring lacuna that

have been urged in these appeals, as to how the findings could

not be sustained, would indicate that         if the sanction for

prosecution had been sought before the competent authority,

the very prosecution may not have been sanctioned and

therefore, the appellants having been visited with a judgment of

conviction on the ill-advised prosecution, it can certainly be

said that a failure of justice has occasioned to the appellants.


</p><p id="p_86">      8. In the light of these rival contentions, without having

to address the question whether the validity or otherwise of the

sanction being the deciding factor in these appeals, the several

infirmities that are highlighted in respect of the charges against

the accused and the findings arrived at by the trial court, in the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_49">                                52</span>




face of the same are certainly significant infirmities, which are

not explained by the court below.           Or are completely

overlooked.
</p>
<p id="p_87">      It is certainly a unenviable task of the learned Senior

Advocate for the respondent to justify the impugned judgment.

</p><p id="p_88">      It is unnecessary to reiterate the several lacunae that are

apparent in the findings arrived at on the basis of the evidence

on record.    As there are innumerable          unexplained   and

unsupported assumptions as canvassed by the learned counsel

for the appellants - the appeals are allowed.

</p><p id="p_89">      The impugned judgment         is set aside insofar as the

appellants are concerned. The accused are acquitted. The fine

amount, if any, paid by the appellants shall be refunded.
