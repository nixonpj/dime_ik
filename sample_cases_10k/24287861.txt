<p id="p_1">1.          Through the instant petition filed under Articles 226/227 of

Panipat was acquired by the State of Haryana vide notification dated

28.2.2013 (Annexure P-2) issued under Section 4 read with Clause (c) of

<a href="/doc/1797812/" id="a_1">Section 17</a> of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 (in short "the Act") followed

by notification dated 16.4.2013 (Annexure P-3) under <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_2">Section 6</a> of the

Act. The award was announced on 17.10.2013 (Annexure P-4). Khasra

No. 90//21/2(1-14) which was not subject matter of notifications,

Annexures P-2 and P-3, was not included in the award, Annexure P-4

and the same was left out from the array of acquisition but at the time of

taking actual physical possession of the land, the said khasra was also

taken by the respondents after announcement of the award. On coming

to know about the constructions of boundary wall upon the acquired land

as well as on the left out land of the petitioners, they approached the

office of respondent No.3 and opposed the construction being raised

upon the land which was not subject matter of the acquisition, but to no

effect. Accordingly, the petitioners served a legal notice dated 7.1.2015

(Annexure P-5) upon the respondents for the handover the possession

of the land in question, but no response has been received. Hence, the

present writ petition.

relief claimed in the writ petition, the petitioners have sent a legal notice

far been taken thereon.

the present petition and without expressing any opinion on the merits of

the case, we dispose of the present petition by directing respondent

No.3 to take a decision on the legal notice dated 7.1.2015 (Annexure P-
