<p id="p_1">                               Civil Suit No.1294 of 2006 was brought by Ramrati

           (respondent No.1 - herein) for declaration to the effect that she is owner in

           possession of the land in dispute and for permanent injunction to restrain the

           respondents from interfering in her possession. As per case of the plaintiff,

           the suit property was owned by Chatar Singh, grandfather of the plaintiff

           and defendants No. 1 to 4 and father of defendant No.5, but the defendants

           taking undue advantage of absence of the plaintiff from the scene had

           forged a Will dated 10.06.1986 of Chattar Singh and based thereupon were

           claiming possession in respect of the suit land and were trying to oust her

           therefrom. The suit was contested by the defendants and the Will dated

           10.06.1986 of Chattar Singh was set up. Issues were framed. Evidence was

           adduced and the parties were heard by the learned Additional Civil Judge

           (Senior Division), Nuh ('trial Court'- for short). However, the learned trial

           Court found that the defendants were not able to prove execution of the Will

           dated 10.06.1986 by Chatar Singh and accordingly decreed plaintiffs suit

           vide judgment/decree dated 31.01.2013.              To challenge judgment/decree

           dated 31.01.2013, defendant - Jagpal filed an appeal, i.e., Civil Appeal No.

           18/12.03.2013, which too has been dismissed by the learned Additional

           District Judge, Nuh ('first appellate Court' - for short) vide judgment/decree

           dated 20.12.2013. To challenge judgment/decree dated 20.12.2013, Jagpal

           and another (i.e. defendant No.2 before 'trial Court') have brought the

           instant regular second appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_2">                               I have heard learned counsel for the appellants.

                               Though, it is argued by learned counsel for the appellant that

           Will dated 10.06.1986 of Chattar Singh has been duly proved and that being

           so judgments/decrees of the Courts below cannot be sustained, it comes out

           from the record that original Will has been held back from the Court and

           only Photostat copy of it has been placed on record as Mark "1". Then,

           neither of the three witnesses, namely Jagpal DW-1, Yog Raj DW-2 and

           Dhoom Singh DW-3, has stated that original of Mark "1" was executed in

           their presence.
</p>
<p id="p_3">                               Learned counsel for the appellant faced with this situation has

           argued that attesting witnesses of the Will having expired it was not possible

           for the appellants to examine any of those witnesses. However, while

           making this submission learned counsel for the appellants has lost sight of

           provisions of <a href="/doc/613078/" id="a_1">Section 69</a> of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, according to

           which in the event of death/non-availability of either of the two attesting

           witnesses of a Will, its execution can be proved by examining a witness

           acquainted with writing/signatures of the executant and/or the attesting

           witnesses. Even this has not been done.
</p>
<p id="p_4">                               Aforesaid witnesses have not ventured to say that they are

           acquainted with the writing and/or signatures of the executant and/or the

           attesting witnesses.
</p>
<p id="p_5">                               Further, scribe of the disputed Will, inspite of being material in

           the absence of attesting witnesses has also not been brought before the

           Court.
</p>
<p id="p_6">                               In view of the above, Will has remained unproved whereas

           onus to prove its validity was on the defendants/appellants. That being the

           situation, I am not inclined to interfere with the concurrent findings

           recorded by the Courts below, more so when the appeal does not involve a

           question of law, much less a substantial one.
