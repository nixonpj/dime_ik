227 OF THE CONSTITUTION OF INDIA, PRAYING TO SET ASIDE
THE ORDER DT.3.4.2017 PASSED BY THE COURT OF THE SENIOR

      THESE PETITIONS COMING ON FOR PRELIMINARY HEARING
THIS DAY, THE COURT MADE THE FOLLOWING:

                            ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">1.    Learned Additional Government Advocate takes notice for

the respondent.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">2.    As the matter lies in a short compass, with the consent of

learned counsel for both parties, the same is taken up for final

disposal.
</p>
<p id="p_4">
</p><p id="p_5">3.    Petitioners claim to be legal representatives of late

Rangaswamaiah. Land bearing Sy.No.14/1 measuring 1 acre 8

guntas situated at Nandihalli Village, Chelur Hobli, Gubbi

Taluk, Tumkur District   was acquired by the State for public

purpose. Not being satisfied with the compensation awarded by

the Special Land Acquisition Officer, late Rangaswamaiah filed

an application under <a href="/doc/868941/" id="a_1">Section 18(1)</a> of the Land Acquisition Act

seeking reference to the Civil Court for determination of market
                                            WPs.22795-22797/2017
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                3</span>



value and for payment of just compensation.         The case was

numbered as LAC.No.55/1997 and was pending on the file of

the Senior Civil Judge, Tumkur.      Subsequently, petition was

dismissed on 22.01.2003 for default as the claimant did not

lead evidence.
</p>
<p id="p_6">
</p><p id="p_7">4.     It is urged by the petitioners that on the establishment of

Senior Civil Judge Court at Gubbi that Court came to acquire

jurisdiction in the matter. Petitioners as legal representatives of

late    Rangaswamaiah       filed   Miscellaneous      Application

No.54/2016       seeking    restoration    of   LAC.No.55/1997.

Petitioners also filed application seeking to come on record as

legal representatives of late Rangaswamaiah by setting aside

abatement and condoning the delay.        It was their case that

original claimant died on 07.09.2012 and petitioners were

unaware of the reference made under <a href="/doc/868941/" id="a_2">Section 18(1)</a> and the

order of dismissal passed on 22.01.2003.
</p>
<p id="p_8">
</p><p id="p_9">5.     In the miscellaneous application, they have offered

explanation for the inaction on their part contending inter alia

that they were not aware of the order closing the reference

petition passed by the Court at Tumkur and that recently they

learnt about dismissal of the petition and thereafter, they took
                                           WPs.22795-22797/2017
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                4</span>



immediate steps by approaching their advocate.         Thus, the

delay in filing miscellaneous application was explained. The

Court below has passed the impugned order dismissing the

miscellaneous application as also the applications filed by the

petitioners to come on record as legal representatives of late

Rangaswamaiah. It is this order that is challenged in these writ

petitions.
</p>
<p id="p_10">
</p><p id="p_11">6.    I have heard the learned counsel for the petitioners and

the learned Additional Government Advocate.


</p><p id="p_12">7.    It is mainly urged by the learned counsel for the

petitioners that Reference Court ought not to have dismissed

the petition for default of appearance of the petitioners as there

is a duty cast on the Court below to decide the matter on

merits.   It is also urged by him that the application filed for

condonation of delay in filing the miscellaneous application for

restoration of reference petition as also applications filed for

bringing the legal representatives on record by setting aside

abatement and condoning the delay ought not to have been

dismissed by the reference Court as the same would result in

land looser going uncompensated for the valuable land lost by

him in the acquisition. It is urged that in similar matters after
                                            WPs.22795-22797/2017
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                 5</span>



considering several judgments of the Apex Court and different

High    Courts,   this   Court   in   similar   circumstances   in

W.P.No.34102/2016 disposed of on 22.06.2016 has allowed the

writ petition by setting aside the order passed by the reference

Court dismissing the applications filed for bringing the legal

representatives on record on the ground that they were barred

by limitation.    A copy of this order is made available to the

Court. Indeed, it is enclosed to the writ petition as Annexure-H.


</p><p id="p_13">8.     Learned Additional Government Advocate submits that

while the claimant, who has lost the land, has to get just and

fair compensation, he cannot be indolent in prosecuting his

case and therefore, even if the claim made by the petitioners

under <a href="/doc/868941/" id="a_3">Section 18(1)</a> is required to be adjudicated in accordance

with law on merits, because of the lapse on their part in

prosecuting their case diligently they are not entitled for

payment of any interest for the delayed period in approaching

this Court, particularly from the date of dismissal of the

reference petition on 22.01.2003 till they filed miscellaneous

application on 08.11.2016.
</p>
<p id="p_14">
</p><p id="p_15">9.     Upon hearing the learned counsel for both parties, I find

that as held by the Apex Court in several judgments which are
                                               WPs.22795-22797/2017
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                     6</span>



considered    in    the    order    dated   22.06.2016      passed    in

W.P.No.34102/2016 and particularly in the case of KHAZAN

SINGH (DEAD) BY L.Rs. Vs. UNION OF INDIA - (2002) 2 SCC 242,         the

reference Court will not be justified in dismissing the reference

for default for non-appearance of the claimant. In a reference

made under <a href="/doc/1517117/" id="a_4">Section 18</a> of the Land Acquisition Act, reference

Court is bound to issue notice to all the interested parties and

pass an award on merits.           Therefore, reference Court was in

error in dismissing the reference petition vide order dated

12.03.2003.        Similarly, when the petitioners herein filed

miscellaneous application seeking restoration of the reference

petition along with applications to come on record by setting

aside   abatement         and   condoning    the   delay     as     legal

representatives of deceased claimant, the Court below ought to

have considered the same keeping in mind the ratio laid down

by the Apex Court and in the ends of justice to compensate the

land loosers by paying them just and reasonable compensation

as per law. The court blow has adopted pedantic approach in

dismissing    the     miscellaneous      application   as    also    the

applications filed by the petitioners to come on record as legal

representatives of deceased claimant.        Therefore, order under

challenge deserves to be set aside.
</p><p id="p_16">                                                       WPs.22795-22797/2017
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                     7</span>



</p><p id="p_17">10.     Petitioners claim to be wife and children of deceased

Rangaswamaiah/claimant.                  They         have     produced         the

genealogical tree. Though they have not produced the ration

card or Aadhar card, fact remains nobody has raised any

objection regarding their relationship with late Rangaswamaiah.

At any rate, as the Court below has dismissed the applications

on the ground that the applications were filed belatedly, it is not

necessary to decide on the merits of the application filed to

bring the legal representatives on record.                   Suffice to observe

that the application filed by the petitioners to come on record is

required to be considered in accordance with law. If they are

found     to   be   the      legal   representatives             of        deceased

Rangaswamaiah,        they    have       to    be     brought         on    record.

Applications filed for condonation of delay and for setting aside

abatement in a matter like this have to be considered liberally

as the claimant is entitled for adjudication of his claim on

merits.
</p>
<p id="p_18">
</p><p id="p_19">11.     Hence, these writ petitions are allowed. Impugned order

is set aside. The Court below is directed to rehear the matter

on    Miscellaneous       Application         filed     for    restoration       of

LAC.No.55/1997 after considering the applications filed by the
                                           WPs.22795-22797/2017
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                8</span>



petitioners to come on record as legal representatives of

deceased claimant - Rangaswamaiah by keeping in mind the

observations made above.       The Court below is directed to

dispose of the applications and the miscellaneous application

as expeditiously as possible.       As rightly contended by the

learned Additional Government Advocate, petitioners shall not

be entitled to claim interest for the period from the date of

dismissal of miscellaneous petition i.e., 22.01.2003 till the date

of filing the miscellaneous application i.e., 08.11.2016, as the

State exchequer cannot be burdened for the delay on the part of

the claimant/his legal representatives in seeking restoration of

the reference petition and in applying to come on record as legal

representatives of deceased claimant.
