                              JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">      This is a complaint under Sec.200 of <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_2">Cr.PC</a> against the
accused for the offence punishable under Sec.138 of the
Negotiable Instruments Act.
</p>
<p id="p_2">2.    The facts of the complaint in brief are that, both the
complainant and accused are known to each other as both of
them are closed friends. On account of well acquainted with
the   complainant,      the    accused        has    approached     the
complainant      and   requested       hand   loan    an   amount    of
Rs.10,00,000/-     to meet out of his family necessities and
accordingly, the complainant considering the request of the
accused and on good faith, the complainant has advanced
hand loan amount of Rs.10,00,000/- to the accused during
the 1st week of April 2016 by way of cash and on that day, the
accused has agreed to repay the said amount within a period
of three months from the date of borrowed to the complainant
and after lapse of stipulated period, on repeated request and
demand made by the complainant to the accused for
repayment of the borrowed loan amount and at that time, the
accused for repayment of the borrowed loan amount the
accused has issued cheque bearing No.000031, dated:
16.04.2016 for a sum of Rs.10,00,000/- drawn on HDFC
Bank, Gandhi Bazar Main Road, Basavanagudi Branch,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                3                 CC No.7888/2017</span>

Bengaluru and assured that, said cheque would be honoured
on its presentation and as per the assurance made by the
accused, the complainant has presented the said cheque for
encashment    through    his   banker   i.e.,   Bank   of   India,
Bengaluru, but it was dishonoured with an endorsement as
"Funds Insufficient" and thereafter, the complainant has
informed the said fact to the accused, but the accused did not
responded the same. Hence, the complainant had got issued
the legal notice on 02.08.2016 through his counsel by RPAD,
calling upon him to repay the said borrowed loan amount
within 15 days from the date of receipt of this legal notice and
it was duly served upon him and after receipt of the legal
notice he has gave untenable and evasive reply notice and
failed to repay the borrowed the loan amount. Hence, the
complainant had constrained to file a complaint against the
accused for the offence punishable under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_3">Section 138</a> of N.I.
Act., which is well within time and based on the records
available on record cognizance has been taken and registered
it PCR.
</p>
<p id="p_3">3.   After recording the sworn statement of the complainant
perused the records it has been registered in CC register and
after issuance of summons to the accused, pursuant to the
summons the accused has appeared before this Court
through his counsel and enlarged on bail and the substance
of the accusation was recorded and read over to him in his
language known to him and he pleaded not guilty and claims
for trail and the complainant himself examined as PW-1 and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                        4                   CC No.7888/2017</span>

when the matter was posted for cross of PW-1 and at that
juncture both the parties have filed joint memo in order to
settle     their   dispute        amicably   between      themselves     on
09.12.2017. Since said complaint filed by the complainant is
compoundable          one,   the     joint memo filed       by them      is
voluntarily one and same is accepted and subsequently, the
accused has failed to pay the installments amount as agreed
by him.
</p>
<p id="p_4">4.       Heard the both parties.
</p>
<p id="p_5">5.       The followings points would arise for my consideration?
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">         (a) Whether the both the complainant and accused have
             settled their dispute voluntarily by way of filing joint
             memo on 09.12.2017 an amount of Rs.8,00,000/-
             out of the cheque amount of Rs.10,00,000/-?
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">         (b) Whether, the accused have violated the terms and
             conditions stated in the joint memo?
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">         (c) What order ?
</blockquote>
<p id="p_6">6.       My answer to the above points:-
</p>
<pre id="pre_2">         Point No.1          :-      In the affirmative

         Point No.2          :-      In the affirmative

         Point No.3          :-      As per the final order following.

                                   REASONS

7.       POINT NO.1 &amp; 2 :-           Point No.1 and 2 have discussed
</pre><p id="p_7">together. On perusal of the joint memo it is reveals that, both
the parties have settled their dispute amicably between
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                  5                CC No.7888/2017</span>

themselves an amount of Rs.8,00,000/- out of the cheque an
amount of Rs.10,00,000/- and further, the accused has
agreed that, he shall pay the said amount in two monthly
installments of Rs.4,00,000/- each which is commence from
16.01.2018 and 16.04.2018 to the complainant as full and
final settlement to the complainant and as per the joint
memo, the accused has paid an amount of Rs.1,00,000/- to
the complainant by way of DD before this Court and
subsequently, the accused neither appear before this Court
nor paid the remaining balance installments amount               of
Rs.7,00,000/- as per the joint memo and he has violated the
terms and condition stipulated therein and looking to the
conduct of the accused, it is apparently on the face of it, he
was and is not diligent to defend his case and thereby, his
cash surety amount deposited at the time enlarged him on
bail same is forfeited to the state. Since the offence
punishable under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_4">Section 138</a> of Negotiable Instruments Act
is "strict liability" to be construed and "menasrea" excluded.
</p>
<p id="p_8">8.    In view of the joint memo filed by them, the counsel for
the complainant prays that, to pass the considered judgment
as per the joint memo. Hence, for all other reasons he prays
for   to   pass   considered   judgment   for   payment   of   the
installments amount, in view of the memo filed by the both
the parties to avoid the multiplicity of the proceedings and to
meet the ends of justice.
</p><p id="p_9">9.    In view of the above settlement and I have considered
the facts and circumstances of the case, I am of the view that,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                  6                 CC No.7888/2017</span>

there is no necessity of recording evidence on merits, since
partly the admission of liability by the accused is to be
considered, as evidence to pass the judgment as prayed for in
joint memo. Therefore, in consideration of the compromise
terms entered into between the parties I, answer points No.1
in the affirmative and the Point No.2 in the affirmative.
</p>
<p id="p_10">10.   POINT NO.3 :- In view of my findings on points No.1
in the affirmative and the point No.2 in the affirmative, I
proceed to pass the following:-.
