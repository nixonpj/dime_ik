ORAL
JUDGMENT</pre> 

 

 


 

<p id="p_1">1.	The
present Second Appeal under Section 100 of the Code of Civil
Procedure has been preferred by the appellants-original defendants to
quash and set aside the impugned judgment and decree passed by the
learned Principal Civil Judge, Halol dated 27/09/2007 in Regular
Civil Suit No. 124/2005 decreeing the suit directing the
appellants-original defendants to return the amount of Rs. 30,450/-
with 9% interest as well as the impugned judgment and order passed by
the learned appellate Court dated 11/10/2011 in Regular Civil Appeal
No. 75/2008.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_2">2.	The
facts leading to the present Second Appeal in a nutshell are as
under;
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_3">2.1.	The
respondent-original plaintiff was serving with the
appellants-original defendants  and he claimed Rs. 11,600/- for LTC
and for that he produced receipt/certificate issued by Kumpavat 
Brothers Tourism.  The   department   sanctioned Rs. 10,150/-, which
was paid to the respondent-original plaintiff.  It appears that
thereafter the respondent-original plaintiff was served with the
notice to recover the aforesaid amount of Rs. 10,150/- on the ground
that in fact he has illegally recovered the aforesaid amount of LTC
as Kumpavat Brothers Tourism was not an authorized agent.  It was
also the case on behalf of the appellants-original defendants that in
fact the respondent-original plaintiff and his family members have
not travelled at all and still the amount of LTC was claimed.  
Having served with the notice, respondent-original plaintiff with
objection deposited the entire amount and thereafter had instituted
Regular Civil Suit No. 124/2005 in the Court of learned Principal
Civil Judge, Halol for recovery of Rs.30,450/-.  Though served with 
the summons, nobody appeared on behalf of the appellants-original
defendants and the appellants-original defendants did not contest the
suit.  The respondent-original plaintiff led the evidence, oral as
well as documentary, and on appreciation of evidence it was found
that Kumpavat Brother Tourism was certified/proved agency and the
respondent-original plaintiff and his family members have in fact
traveled.  The learned trial Court decreed the suit directing the
appellants-original defendants to return Rs. 30,450/- with 9%
interest.  Being aggrieved and dissatisfied with the judgment and
decree passed by the learned Principal Civil Judge, Halol dated
27/09/2007 in Regular Civil Suit No. 124/2005  in decreeing the suit,
the appellants-original defendants preferred Regular Civil Appeal No.
75/2008 before the learned District Court, Panchmahal at Godhra and
the learned Second Additional District Judge, Porbandar at Godhra by
impugned judgment and order dated 11/10/2011 has dismissed the said
appeal confirming the judgment and decree passed by the learned trial
Court.  Being aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned judgment
and order passed by both the Courts below the appellants-original
defendants have preferred the present Second Appeal.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_4">3.	Shri
Uday Shashtri, learned advocate appearing on behalf of the
appellants-original defendants has made only one submission that the
learned appellate Court ought to have remanded the matter to the
learned trial Court to prove that the respondent-original plaintiff
and his family members did not travel and still  claimed LTC and,
therefore, it is requested to remand the matter to the learned trial
Court for deciding the suit afresh.  
</p>
 

 


 

<p id="p_5">4.	Heard
Shri Shashtri, learned advocate appearing on behalf of the
appellants-original defendants and considered the impugned judgment
and order passed by both the Courts below.  At the outset, it is
required to be noted that though served, nobody  appeared on behalf
of the appellants-original defendants and even written statement was
also not filed and the suit was not contested at all.  It is also
required to be noted that by a speaking order, the right of the
appellants-original defendants to file the written statement as well
as to lead the evidence was also closed.  Not only that the
respondent-original plaintiff also led the evidence, which was not
challenged by the appellants-original defendants.  It appears that on
appreciation of evidence, the learned trial Court has specifically
led that the respondent-original plaintiff had travelled through the
travel agent, Kumpavat Brother Tourism, which was recognized and
approved travel agent.  On appreciation of evidence, the learned
trial Court held that in fact the respondent-original plaintiff
travelled and did not get LTC amount.  The learned advocate appearing
on behalf of the appellants-original defendants is not disputing that
as such the LTC claim of the respondent-original plaintiff while
travelling through Kumpavat Brother Tourism is Government recognized
travel agent.  Considering the aforesaid facts and circumstances, it
cannot be said that the learned trial Court has committed any error
and/or illegality in directing the appellants-original defendants to
return the amount of Rs. 30,450/- with 9% interest, which has been
confirmed by the learned appellate Court.  As such, no case is made
out even to remand the matter to the learned trial Court as despite
sufficient opportunity the appellants-original defendants did not
appear before the learned trial Court and even did not contest the
suit.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_6">5.	In
view of the above and for the reasons stated hereinabove, there is no
substance in the present Second Appeal, which deserves to be
dismissed and is accordingly dismissed.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_7"> CIVIL
APPLICATION No. 3524/2012
 

 


 


	In
view of dismissal of the Second Appeal, no order in the Civil
Application.
