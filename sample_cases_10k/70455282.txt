                            CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION

Present:

The Hon'ble Justice Jyotirmay Bhattacharya
                    AND
The Hon'ble Justice Shivakant Prasad


                                       F.M.A.T. 788 of 2017
                                              with

For the Plaintiffs/Appellants    : Mr. Rajdeep Bhattacharya,

For the Defendants/Respondents : Mr. Shyamal Sur.</pre>


<pre id="pre_2">Heard On            :      21-08-2017.

Judgement On        :      21-08-2017.


      Jyotirmay Bhattacharya, J. :

      This appeal will be heard.

      Lower court records need not be called for.

</pre><p id="p_1">      Since the respondents are represented by their learned advocate Mr.

Shyamal Sur, service of notice of appeal upon the respondents is dispensed with.

The appeal is thus treated ready as regards service of notice of appeal upon the

respondents.
</p><p id="p_2">       While considering the application for injunction filed in connection with

this appeal, we are requested by the learned counsel appearing for the parties to

dispose of the appeal itself on merit. We are also informed by the learned counsel

appearing for the parties that the relevant papers, which are necessary for

disposal of the appeal, are all annexed to the injunction application. Considering

such prayer of the learned counsel appearing for the parties, we have decided to

dispose of the appeal itself on merit by dispensing with the requirement of filing

paper book in this appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_3">
</p><p id="p_4">      By the impugned order, the plaintiffs' application for temporary injunction

was rejected by the learned Trial Judge. The plaintiffs prayed for temporary

injunction for restraining the defendants from changing the nature and character

of the suit property till the disposal of the suit. Such prayer was made in a suit

for partition.
</p>
<p id="p_5">
</p><p id="p_6">      Though the learned Trial Judge after considering the pleadings of the

respective parties and the photocopy of the deed being No.2968 of 2007 came to

the conclusion that the vendor of the plaintiffs Partha Dalui purchased a defined

and demarcated portion in the suit property and subsequently the plaintiffs in

the year 2009 purchased the suit property from the said Partha Dalui, but at the

same time the learned Trial Judge held that the parties still remain co-sharers in

the suit property as the oral partition amongst the original co-sharers prior to the

R.S. operation was disbelieved by the learned Trial Judge.
</p><p id="p_7">       Despite holding as such, the learned Trial Judge rejected the plaintiffs'

application for temporary injunction, as according to the learned Trial Judge,

every co-sharer has right, title and interest over every inch of the suit property

and one co-sharer cannot restrain the other co-sharers from raising construction

on the joint property. The legality and/or propriety of the said order is under

challenge in this appeal at the instance of the plaintiffs/appellants.


</p><p id="p_8">      Though it is rightly held by the learned Trial Judge that every co-sharer

has right to enjoy every inch of the suit property, but at the same time it is well

settled that any co-sharer cannot be permitted to raise construction either on the

best portion of the suit property or on a portion of the joint property exceeding

his share as in the event, any of the co-sharer is permitted to do so, the partition

of the joint property as per shares of the co-sharers may not ultimately be

effected even though the plaintiff succeeds in the suit.


</p><p id="p_9">      As such, we hold that the defendants should not be permitted to raise any

construction during the pendency of the suit. We are reluctant to grant this

permission to the defendants in this case as we find from the record that the

defendants were attempting to raise construction even in violation of the order of

ad interim injunction and the police help had to be given by the learned trial

court to resist the defendants from raising any construction over the suit

property in violation of the court's order.
</p>
<p id="p_10">
</p><p id="p_11">      Accordingly, we dispose of the appeal and the application filed in

connection therewith by directing the parties to maintain status quo as regards
 the nature and character of the suit property and/or the construction as on

today till the disposal of the suit. It is, however, made clear that operation of this

interim order of injunction will be restricted only to the suit property being Plot

No. 3481 and will not be applicable to the non-suit property being Plot No. 3482.


</p><p id="p_12">      Both the appeal and the application for injunction being CAN 6870 of 2017

filed in connection with the appeal are, thus, disposed of.


</p><p id="p_13">      Urgent photostat certified copy of this order, if applied for, be given to the

parties as expeditiously as possible.
</p>
<p id="p_14">
</p><p id="p_15">                                        (JYOTIRMAY BHATTACHARYA, J.)


                                           ( SHIVAKANT PRASAD, J. )
