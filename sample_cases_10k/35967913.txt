State Vs. Kapil Dev Sharma
SC No.65/2006                                                                     12/27
</pre><p id="p_42"> 29. Ld. APP for state, Sh. Zenual Abedeen argued that accused had enticed the

   prosecutrix  with intention to commit rape upon her and in this regard a

   complaint showing doubt upon accused was filed with the  Police Station

   accordingly   case   under   <a href="/doc/619940/" id="a_27">section   363</a>/<a href="/doc/1279834/" id="a_28">376</a>/<a href="/doc/886598/" id="a_29">365</a>/<a href="/doc/1629021/" id="a_30">368</a>/<a href="/doc/1535430/" id="a_31">328</a>/<a href="/doc/180217/" id="a_32">506</a>   IPC   was

   registered.   Ld.   APP   further   argued   that   on   the   day   of   commission   of

   offence the    prosecutrix  was aged about 17 ½ years.   In the year 2006

   prosecutrix  was in 10th  standard and according to documentary evidence

   date of birth of  prosecutrix is 20.12.1988. Ld. APP for state submits that

   prosecutrix  was taken by the accused without the consent of the guardian

   and   according   to   medical   report   accused   had   committed   rape   upon   the

   prosecutrix  hence,  he  has  committed  the offence  punishable  376  &amp;  363

   <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_33">IPC</a>. Ld. APP for state relies upon the statement of  prosecutrix wherein the

   prosecutrix has stated that accused had committed galat kaam with her by

   putting some stupifying substance in cold  drink when she was going to

   market and accused dragged her into coaching centre.     Further Ld. APP

   rely his case on the statement of PW2 Babu Ram father of prosecutrix who

   has made complaint to the police and shown his doubt upon the accused.

   Ld. APP submits that since the statement of  prosecutrix  and statement of

   father of  prosecutrix support the case of prosecution, therefore, the present

   case is squarely covered under the ingredients of 375 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_34">IPC</a> and the statement

   of    prosecutrix  is sufficient to convict the accused for offence charged as

    prosecution has proved its case beyond reasonable doubt.



</p><p id="p_43">30.On   the   other   hand,   Sh.   C.S.S.   Tomar   counsel  for   accused   submits   that

   accused has been implicated falsely in the present case.     Ld. counsel for

   accused insisted upon the conduct of the  prosecutrix with the accused and

   he insisted  upon the love letters written by the  prosecutrix to the accused

   and photographs of accused and  prosecutrix which shows the willingness

   of  prosecutrix. For the purpose of conviction u/s 376 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_35">IPC</a> Ld. counsel for

   accused pointed out that age of    prosecutrix must be 16 years and in the

   present   case     age   of   prosecutrix   is  17   ½   years   on   the   date   of   alleged

   commission   of   offence,   hence   accused   cannot   be   convicted   under   the

   provision   of   376   <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_36">IPC</a>.   Ld.   counsel   for   accused   pointed   out   different

   statements   of  prosecutrix,   first   statement   dated   17.08.2006   which

   Ex.PW1/B wherein the  prosecutrix had stated that she was in 12th and for

   the last three/four months she was not feeling well at home so that she was

   not willing to live at her home, and in that statement she had shown her

   ignorance with any identity of accused Kapil Bhardwaj.   And in another

   statement   dated   22.08.2006     prosecutrix   stated   that   statement   dated

   17.08.2006  she had given under the pressure of counsel for accused Kapil

   Bhardwaj and further her statement u/s 164 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_37">Cr.P.C</a>. Ex.PW1/A made before

   Ld.   MM   wherein   she   had   deposed   that   she   used   to   take   tuition   from

   accused Kapil Sharma and when one day she was going to Bazar from her

    house accused Kapil dragged her into his coaching centre, thereafter, Kapil

   took her to various places and committed galat kaam.  Ld. counsel further

   insisted his arguments on medical report where the age of  prosecutrix is 17

   ½ years.   On  the  basis   of  love   letters  and   photographs  Ld.   counsel  for

   accused states that this shows the maturity and understanding capacity of

   the   prosecutrix  and  when the   prosecutrix is so mature and capable to

   understand the  negative and positive effect of her steps in her life then why

   this   prosecutrix did not disclose this fact to any member of her family.

   Since   the     prosecutrix   was   in   relation   with   accused.       Ld.   counsel   for

   accused  further submits that  the    prosecutrix  visited  almost half  part of

   India but no police person or public person met her from whom she could

   have asked for help even while staying at Sonia Vihar which is very much

   near to the parental house of  prosecutrix but she did not try to ran away

   from the confinement of accused.   Neither she raised any alarm for help

   from the landlord or from any public person.   On these observations, ld.

   counsel submits that   prosecutrix is consenting party in the present case.

   Hence, accused cannot be convicted under <a href="/doc/1279834/" id="a_38">section 376</a> IPC and he prayed

   for acquittal of accused on these grounds.  Ld. counsel for accused pointed

   out that in her cross examination  prosecutrix had admitted that love letters

   written   to   accused   were   in   her   handwriting.   She   also   admits   the

   photographs   with   the   accused.     Further   in   her   cross   examination   this

   witness has admitted that coaching centre of accused is in busy crowded

   various   judgments   of   Hon'ble   Supreme   Court   of   India   titled   as    'S.

   years r/o House No. A­1/98, First Pusta, Sonia Vihar, Delhi who is the

   landlord of this house where  prosecutrix stayed with the accused as wife

   articles are still lying at the said rented room.   Age of  prosecutrix is not

   disputed.

<p id="p_81">

</p><p id="p_82">41.In my opinion too it is not possible for single man to rape a woman without

   any resistance at all when subjected to forcibly intercourse, the victim is

   likely to offer some resistance to protect her body from injury in form of

   bruises, abrasions, etc. that would  offer physical evidence regarding  the

   incident which is missing in the present case.   As per the  prosecutrix story

   rape was committed upon  prosecutrix against her will.

   Prosecutrix was to  held to be consenting party.

</p><p id="p_85">43.To   bring   the   case  of     prosecution  under   the   definition  of   rape     on   the

   ground of injury, there must be some injury on the body of  prosecutrix. No

   doubt hymen of prosecutrix was found torn but in cross examination doctor

   has gave opinion that it cannot be said that hymen was old or newly torn.

   appear on her person whereas in the present case no external injury was

   found   on   the  body  of     prosecutrix.     In  my  view  these  submissions  and

   admissions raised doubt upon the story of the prosecution as no injury is

   found on the body of   prosecutrix.   Chemical analysis also recorded no

   semen or blood, as blood sample was putrefied, even nothing   was found

    or public person from whom she might have asked to help her.  Even in her

   entire tour with accused she did not find any person to whom she could

   make a complaint it is highly improbable and unbelievable and it is very

   strange  that country like India which is having population of 125 crores but

   none of the 25% people of that population she could find to make  any

   complaint   or   ask   help.   Even   when   accused   took   her   to   Kashmere   Gate

   ISBT by TSR she did not find any police personnel or any public person.  It

   is highly unbelievable.  Even her stay at Sonia Vihar with accused, which is

   very close to the residence of  prosecutrix she did not disclose this fact that

   accused  had  enticed her and  committing  rape with her against her will.

   Rather   she   enjoyed   Sonia   Vihar   by   visiting   market   with   the   family

   members   and other co­tenants of landlord.  Even the diary Ex.PW1/DX5

   shows that the  prosecutrix  was in deep love affairs with the accused.

   that technology effect the mental level of the person and since the culture of

   society   has   also   been   changed,   hence   duties   lies   upon   the   shoulders   of

   parents and children too that they must think before moving their step into

   either direction whether it is good.  Crime against the woman is also a kind

   of terror against the woman and as society have become vigilant in the case
