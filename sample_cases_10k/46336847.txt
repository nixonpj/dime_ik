     As the issues involved in all these appeals are identical

they are heard concomitantly. For the sake of convenience

the facts stated in W.A.No. 202 of 2012 are taken for

ready reference.
</p>
<p id="p_5">2.   These appeals are filed against a common judgment

passed by the learned Single Judge in W.P. No.5070/2011

(M/s Jai Hanuman Stone Crusher Vs. M.P. Poorva

Kshetra Vidyut Vitran Co. Ltd. and others) and all other

connected matters.
</p>
<p id="p_6">3.   The learned Single Judge has dismissed the petitions,

filed by the persons who are involved in the business of

crushing stone and converting them into chips known as

Gitti, challenging the imposition of Electricity Duty under the

provisions of M.P. Electricity Duty Act, 1949 at the rate of

40% by treating the petitioners/appellants as mines under

entry no.3 of Part B of the Table appended to Sub section (1)

of <a href="/doc/615740/" id="a_1">Section 3</a> of the Act, 1949. The levy of electricity duty at

the rate of 40% was challenged by the petitioners/appellants

on the ground that the appellants are not miners as they do

not possess a mining licence nor are they involved in the

activities of extracting minerals as well as on the ground that

their crushers were not situated in and adjacent to a mine.

</p><p id="p_7">4.   It was contended that in view of the aforesaid admitted

and undisputed factual premises prevailing in the case, the
                                      W.A. No.202/2012 &amp; connected matters

</p><p id="p_8">                             - 6 -
</p>
<p id="p_9">
respondents have erred in law in charging electricity duty

under entry No.3 instead of entry relating to industries in

general. It is submitted that previously the respondents were

charging electricity duty as an industry but by circular dated

30.03.2010, the petitioners/appellants have been brought

within entry No.3 by applying the definition of mines as

contained in Explanation-B of <a href="/doc/615740/" id="a_2">Section 3</a> of the Act of 1949.

</p><p id="p_10">5.   It is contended that, by the aforesaid impugned circular,

the respondents have treated the crushing Unit of the

appellants as 'mines' and have imposed electricity duty at

the rate of 40%.
</p>
<p id="p_11">6.   The learned counsel for the appellants contended that

as the appellants are neither miners nor is their crushing unit

situated in and adjacent to a mine and as these aspects and

factual contentions of the appellants are undisputed, the

levy of higher rate of duty @ 40% upon the appellants, is

illegal. It is submitted that the appellants were and are

entitled to pay electricity duty at the rate prescribed for

industries in general.
</p>
<p id="p_12">7.   The learned counsel for the parties have fairly stated

before this Court that the M.P. Electricity Duty Act, 1949 has

been repealed by the M.P. Vidyut Shulk Adhiniyam, 2012 and

that the dispute in respect of the rate of duty in the present

appeals is for the period 2010 to 2012. It is submitted that
                                     W.A. No.202/2012 &amp; connected matters

</p><p id="p_13">                            - 7 -
</p>
<p id="p_14">
since the year 2012, the appellants are paying duty @ 9%,

pursuant to an interim order passed by this court as well as

in view of entry no.6 of the Schedule appended to the M.P.

Vidyut Shulk Adhiniyam, 2012.
</p>
<p id="p_15">8.   The learned Government Advocate for the State, per

contra, submits that in view of the decision of this court

rendered in the case of the Stone Crusher Owners

Association and others Vs. Madhya Pradesh Electricity

Board and others,         (M.P. No. 673/1993) decided on

19.10.1994 as well as the decision in the case of Hindustan

Copper Limited Vs. State of M.P. and others, AIR 2012

M.P. 49, and the Division Bench decision of the Indore Bench

of this Court in the case of State of Madhya Pradesh Vs.

M/s Stuti and others, (W.A. No.140/2011) decided on

15.12.2016, the issue raised by the appellants is no longer

res integra and has already been decided against them by

the Division Bench of this Court. It is submitted that in such

circumstances, the appeals, filed by the appellants, be

dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_16">9.   We have heard the learned counsel for the parties at

length.
</p>
<p id="p_17">10. It is observed that in the case of the Stone Crusher

Owners Association (supra) decided on 19.10.1994, the

appellants, apart from challenging the rate of the electricity

duty    imposed     upon    them,    had     also     challenged       the

constitutional validity of the definition of Mines as given in

<a href="/doc/615740/" id="a_3">section 3</a> of the Act of 1949. The Division Bench of this

Court, while dismissing the petition as far as the challenge to

the constitutional validity of the definition of the Mines is

concerned, did not advert to or decide the issues that have

been raised by the appellants in the present appeals, as

enumerated in the preceding paragraphs. However, as far as

the contention of discrimination regarding levy of different

rates of electricity duty to the crushers situated in and

adjacent to mines and those situated away from the mines is

concerned, the Division Bench directed the respondents to

look into the matter and held as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">       "12. Yet another submission putforth was that the
       State has not charged the same rate in respect of
       other persons the details of which have been given in
       the petition. It is alleged that State is discriminating
       between the same class. The avertments made in this
       regard in para (1) of the petition have not been
       controverted by the State or the Electricity Board. It is
       a wrong exercise of power by the authority which does
       not make the law invalid. The respondents shall look
       into the matter and correct the bills issued in respect
       of persons mentioned in the petition."
</blockquote>


<p id="p_20">11. The decision in the case of the Stone Crusher Owners

Association (supra) was considered by a Division Bench of

this court in L.P.A. No. 247/1998 (M/s. Vastu Vs. M.P.
</p><p id="p_21">                                        W.A. No.202/2012 &amp; connected matters

Electricity Board and others) wherein the Division Bench

has clearly held that the issue as to whether entry no.3 was

confined necessarily to a crushing unit indulging in mining

and the import of the words "in or adjacent" mentioned in

the definition of mine contained in the Electricity Duty Act

was neither considered or decided in that case and therefore

referred the matter to back to the Single Bench for

adjudication in that regard.
</p>
<p id="p_24">12. The observations made by the Division Bench in the

case of M/s. Vastu (supra) in this regard as contained in

paragraph 3 are as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">     "3.   We have perused the judgment dated 19.10.94
     passed in M.P.No.673/93. In the said M.P. No.673/93,
     the challenge was to the vires to the said definition of
     'mine' given in Sec.3(b) of the M.P. Electricity Duty Act,
     1949 as also the amendment made in the Schedule,
     imposing higher tariff.   The Division Bench held that
     the provisions under challenge do not suffer from any
     constitutional-vice or from any statutory invalidity.
     With this finding the said petition was dismissed. The
     point projected in the present petition as to whether a
     crushing unit situated outside the mining area or to be
     more precise not situated in or adjacent to a mine will
     also be covered by the said definition of 'mine', was
     not in issue nor decided in M.P.673/93. In our
     considered opinion, the learned Single Judge ought to

     case back to the learned Single Judge for deciding the
     petition afresh. It will also be appropriate to have the

<blockquote id="blockquote_4">     reply of the State filed in the case. After all it is the
     State which is the real contesting party inasmuch as
     the duty is to be paid to the State although through the
     agency of the M.P. Electricity Board. It is really
     surprising   to   note   that   the    State    having    taken
     adjournments several times failed to file their reply.
     Shri Desai, learned Dy. Adv. General submits that the
     reply shall be filed by the State no sooner the case is

<p id="p_25">13. The Single Bench of this court in the case of Shri

Krishna Mehrotra v. Madhya Pradesh State Electricity

Board and others, (W.P. No. 3153/2004) decided on

28.08.2008 has considered the aforesaid two aspects and

has held that the electricity duty under the entry 'Mine' can

be imposed upon a stone crusher only in case the crushing

unit also possesses a mining lease and that it is established

in or adjacent to a Mine.
</p>
<p id="p_26">14. The learned Single Judge, in the impugned order, has

held that the issue raised by the petitioners is squarely

covered by the decision in the case of Stone Crusher

Owners Association (supra) and Hindustan Copper

(supra) and has not agreed with the decision of the Division

Bench in the case of M/s Vastu (supra) by making the

following observations:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">     "26. The Division Bench was thus very much alive of
     the issue and the expanse of applicability of the
     definition 'mines' contained in Explanation (b) of

<blockquote id="blockquote_7">     Section 3 of 1949 Act. It appears that the Division
     Bench in M/s. Vastu (supra) overlooked the above
     facts while observing that "the point projected as to
     whether a crushing unit situated outside the mining
     area or to be more precise not situated adjacent to a
     mine will also be covered by the said definition of
     'mine' was not in issue nor decided in M.P. 673/1993.
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_8">     27.   The issue as to whether a crushing unit situated
     outside the mining area or to be more precise not
     situated in or adjacent to a mine being covered by
     decisions in the Crusher Owners Association and other
     (supra) and Hindustan Copper Limited (supra), i.e. the
     petitioners though not the mine owners, having the
     crushing unit established at place nor adjacent or in
     the premises where the mine is situated being
     covered by the definition of 'mine' as contained in
     Explanation (b) to section 3 of 1949 Act are liable to
     pay electricity duty as applicable to the "mines (other
     than captive mines of a cement industry)."
</blockquote>


<p id="p_27">15. It is evident from the above that the learned Single

Judge has held that a crushing unit which is situated outside

the mining area and is not situated in and adjacent to a Mine

and was not indulging in mining activities, is yet required to

pay electricity duty under the entry relating to mines in view

of the decision in the case of Hindustan Copper (supra)

and Stone Crusher Owners Association (supra).                           A

Division Bench of this Court in the case of M/s Stuti (supra)

decided on 15.12.2016, has recorded a similar finding by
                                          W.A. No.202/2012 &amp; connected matters

Judge.
</p>
<p id="p_30">16. The learned counsel for the parties point out that the

decision rendered by this Court in the case of Hindustan

Copper        (supra)   has   been   over-ruled      in   the    case     of

Manganese Ore India Vs. State of M.P and others,

(2017) 1 SCC 81. At the same time it is also pointed out that

the decision of this Court, upholding the validity of <a href="/doc/615740/" id="a_4">Section 3</a>

of the Act of 1949, in the case of Stone Crusher Owners

Association (supra), has been affirmed by the Supreme

Court.

<p id="p_31">17. In the instant case, as recorded by the learned Single

Judge in the impugned judgment as well as in para 27, it is

an admitted and undisputed fact that the appellants are not

holding a mining lease nor are they indulging in any mining

activities.    It is also an undisputed fact that the crushing

units are not situated in and adjacent to a mine.

</p><p id="p_32">18.      In view of the decisions referred to in the preceding

paragraphs, it is apparent that a Division Bench of this Court

in the case of M/s Vastu (supra) has categorically held that

the aforesaid two issues have neither been considered nor

decided by the Division Bench of this Court in the case of

Stone Crusher Owners Association (supra). Contrary to

the aforesaid view taken by the Division Bench in the case of
                                           W.A. No.202/2012 &amp; connected matters

M/s Vastu (supra), the Division Bench in the case of M/s

Stuti (supra), has held that all the stone crushers would fall

within the definition of Mines irrespective of the fact that

they are not indulging in any mining activity and that their

crushing units are not situated in and adjacent to a mine.

</p><p id="p_35">19.   The definition of "Mine" as contained in <a href="/doc/615740/" id="a_5">Section 3(b)</a> of

<p id="p_38">20. From a perusal thereof, it is apparent that the expanded

only to those involved in crushing, processing, treating or

situated "in or adjacent to a Mine".
</p>
<p id="p_41">21. Quite apart from the above, it is also apparent that the

main entry in the schedule relating to imposition of

electricity duty under the Act of 1949, relates to a Mine and,

therefore, the issue as to whether the process of crushing,

processing,     treating or   transporting         the    mineral in        a

fall within the aforesaid entry only in case the person

(supra) and M/s Stuti (supra) and in the absence of any

detailed discussion in respect of applicability of the entry
