<p id="p_15">5.2    In Jain            Soniya   Rajeshkumar        (supra), the           Court

Application        No.8152         of    2015 and     allied        petitions,

decided on 07.09.2016. In the said batch of petitions

also the petitioners were similarly situated who had

raised identical grievance that thead hoc Lecturers

appointed prior to May, 2008, are granted the regular

pay­scale and those appointed subsequent to May, 2008,

are   being        deprived        of      the     regular     pay        and        the

incidental service benefits.

      par with the ad hoc Lecturers appointed prior to
      May 2008. The ad hoc Lecturers appointed after
      May 2008 shall be paid the salary and other
      allowances on par with the same received by the
      ad hoc Lecturers appointed prior to May 2008.
      Such benefits shall be granted to them with
      effect from January 2015 onwards. It is directed
      that the contractual Lecturers shall be paid the
      minimum of the pay scale so far as the post of
      Lecturer is concerned with all other allowances
      attached to the same with effect from January
      2015."
</p>
<p id="p_17">5.4    The aforesaid decision was carried in Letters

Patent     Appeal          No.1184      of     2017   along      with        other

cognate petitions. The said challenge was directed to

the aspect that the benefits came to be directed to

be granted to the petitioners from the year 2015

onwards and not from their initial appointments.
</p>

<p id="p_18">5.5      The      Division      Bench          in   the   Letters          Patent

Appeal, observed and held as under,

      "[8.3]   Now, so far as Letters Patent Appeal
      No.1184/2017     preferred     by    the    original
      petitioners    of    Special    Civil    Application
      No.8152/2015 challenging the impugned common
      judgment and order passed by the learned Single
      Judge insofar as granting the reliefs fully with
      effect from January 2015 onwards only and not
      granting   the    reliefs    from   their    initial
      appointment is concerned, at the outset it is
      required to be noted that as such the learned
      Advocate appearing on behalf of the original
      petitioners before the learned Single Judge
      heavily relied upon the decision of the Bombay
      High Court in the case of Sachin Ambadas Dawale
      (Supra) in Writ Petition No.2046/2010 in support
      of their submission that their services must be

regularized from the date of their initial
appointment. However, the learned Single Judge
though observed that he could have followed the
decision of the Bombay High Court, which came to
be affirmed by the Honble Supreme Court, and
could have issued the directions in tune with
the one issued by the Bombay High Court as
regards regularization of service, however, he
was not inclined to issue any mandamus in that
regard. The learned Single Judge in para 64 has
observed as under:
</p>
<p id="p_19">   "64. I am of the view that the aforenoted
   Notification is in no manner helpful to the
   writ applicants and could hardly be said to
   be in line with the suggestion of this Court
   referred to above. I could have followed the
   Division Bench decision of the Bombay High
   Court referred to above, which came to be
   affirmed by the Supreme Court, and could have
   issued directions in tune with one issued by
   the Division Bench of the Bombay High Court
   as   regards   regularisation    in   service.
   However, for the present, I am not inclined
   to issue any mandamus in this regard. At the
   same time, I am of the firm view that the ad
   hoc Lecturers appointed after May 2008 should
   be put on par with the ad hoc Lecturers
   appointed prior to May 2008 and should be
   paid the pay scale and other benefits
   accordingly. In the same way, I am of the
   view that the contractual Lecturers should be
   paid the minimum of the pay scale so far as
   the post of Lecturer is concerned with all
   other allowances attached to the same."
</p>
<p id="p_20">There is no further justification at all by the
learned Single Judge to grant the benefits after
putting them at par with those appointed prior
to May 2008 from January 2015 onwards only.
However, at the same time considering the
decision of the Honble Supreme Court in the case
of Shiv Dass (Supra), the original petitioners
shall be entitled to the benefits at par with
those adhoc lecturers appointed prior to May
2008 from the last 3 years preceding filing of

   C/SCA/8343/2019                          ORDER



the petition. There is no justification at all
in granting such benefits with effect from
January 2015 onwards only. Once it is held that
all those adhoc lecturers / Assistant Professors
appointed after May 2008 shall be put at par
with the adhoc lecturers appointed prior to May
2008, they are entitled to such benefits for the
period even prior to filing of the petitions.
However, they can be granted the benefits of
last 3 years from the date of filing of the
petition only. Therefore, to the aforesaid
extent the impugned common judgment and order
passed by the learned Single Judge is required
to be modified and Letters Patent Appeal
No.1184/2017 is required to be partly allowed to
the   aforesaid   extent.  Considering   various
decisions of the Honble Supreme Court as well as
this Court, the original petitioners who as such
are appointed as adhoc lecturers and till the
regular selected GPSC candidates are available,
the learned Single Judge has right not granted
the relief of regularization, however at the
same time has rightly put them at par with other
similarly situated employees insofar as the
salary and other benefits are concerned. The
impugned judgment and order passed by the
learned Single Judge is absolutely in consonance
with the decision of the Honble Supreme Court in
the case of Jagjit Singh (Supra). In the
aforesaid decision the Honble Supreme Court in
para 42.2, 42.3, 42.6 and 42.7 has observed and
held as under:
</p>
<p id="p_21">   "42.2 The mere fact that the subject post
   occupied by the claimant, is in a different
   department vis­a­vis the reference post, does
   not have any bearing on the determination of
   a claim, under the principle of equal pay for
   equal work. Persons discharging identical
   duties, cannot be treated differently, in the
   matter of their pay, merely because they
   belong to different departments of Government
   (see Randhir Singh case7 and D.S. Nakara
   case).

   work, applies to cases of unequal scales of
   pay, based on no classification or irrational
   classification (see Randhir Singh case7). For
   equal pay, the concerned employees with whom
   equation is sought, should be performing
   work, which besides being functionally equal,
   should be of the same quality and sensitivity
   (see Federation of All India Customs and
   Central Excise Stenographers case9, Mewa Ram
   Kanojia case11, Grih Kalyan Kendra Workers
   Union case6 and S.C. Chandra case).
</p>
<p id="p_23">  42.6 For placement in a regular pay­scale,
  the claimant has to be a regular appointee.
  The claimant should have been selected, on
  the   basis   of   a   regular   process   of
  recruitment. An employee appointed on a
  temporary basis, cannot claim to be placed in
  the regular pay­scale (see Orissa University
  of Agriculture &amp; Technology case).
