       AJ. SL.2.


                    F.M.A. 269 of 2015
            Dulal Chandra Halder
                     -Vs-
            South 24-Parganas District Primary
             School Council &amp; Ors.

          Mr. Piyush Chaturvedi,
          Mr. Satyajit Mahato.
                     ......for the appellant.
          Mr. Gourav Das.
                     ......for the respondents 1 &amp; 2.</pre>


<p id="p_1">           The unsuccessful writ petitioner in W.P. 5383(W) of 2012 is the

appellant before us.
</p>
<p id="p_2">           Name of the appellant was sponsored by the relevant employment

exchange to the South 24-Parganas District Primary School Council (hereafter the

council) as an 'Exempted Category' candidate for recruitment on the post of

assistant teacher in primary schools within the jurisdiction of the council. The

appellant participated in the process of selection, was selected and ultimately

offered appointment by a letter dated 3rd May, 2010 issued by the chairman of the

council (hereafter the chairperson). The offer of appointment was accepted by the

appellant and he started discharging duty as an assistant teacher in a primary school.

However, the appellant was informed by a letter dated 9th January, 2012 issued by

the chairperson of the council to the effect that on a recalculation of the marks

worked out by the council in terms of rule 9 of the Recruitment Rules of 2001, it

was found that the appellant ought not to have been empanelled and that his

empanelment was erroneous. Accordingly, the appointment letter stood cancelled

and service of the appellant terminated.
</p>
<p id="p_3">           Alleging that the appointment letter was cancelled and appointment

terminated by the council in utter breach of the principles of natural justice, the

appellant had entered into the portals of this Court by invoking its writ jurisdiction.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                2</span>

</p><p id="p_4">             The writ petition was dismissed by a judgement and order dated 12th

April, 2012, referred to above, by a learned Judge of this Court. The learned Judge

was of the considered view that although the appellant was entitled to an

opportunity for placing his version before the chairperson of the council before he

terminated the appointment, such hearing would have been a mere ritual without

there being any possibility of a change of decision on merits.

</p><p id="p_5">             It would appear from the impugned letter dated 9th January, 2012 that the

council had committed a mistake in calculating the marks to be awarded to the

appellant in terms of rule 9(2)(b) and (c) by proceeding on the basis that the

appellant in the school final examination had secured 364 marks out of 900 marks

instead of 1000 marks.
</p>
<p id="p_6">             In course of hearing, Mr. Chaturvedi, learned advocate appearing on

behalf of the appellant did not dispute that the council was right in recalculating the

marks, but sought leave to rely on additional documents by filing a supplementary

affidavit. It was his contention that the appellant was entitled to 2 more marks on

the basis of having obtained a certificate from the National Cadet Corps (hereafter

NCC) and also having participated in sports at the district level.

</p><p id="p_7">             For the ends of justice, we allowed Mr. Chaturvedi to rely on the

supplementary affidavit. We have perused the contents thereof but are nevertheless

of the view that nothing turns in favour of the appellant even on the basis of such

affidavit.
</p>
<p id="p_8">             In terms of rule 9(2)(f) of the Rules, 1 mark could have been allotted to

the appellant if he had obtained "A", "B" or "C" level certificate of NCC. The

certificate that has been annexed to the supplementary affidavit does not conform to

such standard. That apart, the evidence adduced by the appellant to prove that he

had participated in sports at the district level appears to have been issued in the year

2009, whereas the selection process was conducted sometime in the year 2006.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                               3</span>

</p><p id="p_9">           For the reasons aforesaid, we see no reason to hold that the council by

not extending opportunity of hearing to the appellant prior to canceling the

appointment letter and terminating his appointment acted in a such manner that

would warrant interference.
</p>
<p id="p_10">           There is no merit in the appeal. The same stands dismissed, without any

order for costs.
</p>
<p id="p_11">           Urgent photostat certified copy of this order, if applied for,

be supplied expeditiously after complying with all necessary legal

formalities.
</p>
<p id="p_12">
</p><p id="p_13">                                  ( Dipankar Datta, J. )
