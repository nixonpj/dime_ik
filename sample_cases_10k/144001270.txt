              Petitioner seeks concession of anticipatory bail in case

FIR No.919 dated 09.09.2015, under <a href="/doc/1667388/" id="a_1">Sections 419</a>, <a href="/doc/1436241/" id="a_2">420</a> of Indian

Penal Code, registered at Police Station Hisar Sadar, District Hisar.

</p><p id="p_2">              Allegations are primarily in the nature of having secured a

Government job on the basis of having qualified the State Teachers'

Eligibility Test (STET) by way of impersonation.

</p><p id="p_3">              The entire case made out on behalf of the petitioner is

that the selection process in pursuance to which the petitioner had

been selected and appointed was assailed in a bunch of writ petitions

before this Court and while disposing of such petitions in the light of

order and judgment dated 03.08.2015 passed by the learned Single

Judge directions were issued to the State to initiate action against

such persons who were involved in any malpractice after conducting

                                      1 of 3

a departmental inquiry.
</p>
<p id="p_4">             During     the    course       of   arguments,       it    has       gone

uncontroverted that the departmental inquiry initiated at the hands of

the State Government is still underway. This also explains the

situation that services of the petitioner have neither been placed

under suspension nor terminated.
</p>
<p id="p_5">             Needless to observe that the entire exercise is clearly to

unravel the fraud that may have been committed by persons securing

appointment by way of impersonation in a STET.

</p><p id="p_6">             It has also transpired during the course of arguments that

the FIR has been lodged on the basis of report of the Forensic

Science Laboratory and which itself is not clear as to whether the

signatures/thumb impressions of certain candidates tallied with the

one which was obtained at the time of taking the examination.

</p><p id="p_7">             Counsel appearing for the petitioner has adverted to an

order dated 21.12.2015 passed by this Court in CRM No.M-40940 of

2015 (Naresh Kumar Vs. State of Haryana) whereby the petitioner

therein and against whom there were identical allegations has been

granted concession of pre-arrest bail.
</p>
<p id="p_8">             Mr. Vivek Saini, DAG Haryana has very fairly stated that

in case the petitioner is ready and willing to come forth and to give

her     signature   samples/handwriting          samples     as        also   thumb

impression to facilitate the same to be cross-checked with the

signatures/thumb impression on the answer sheet/admit card, the

State would have no objection to grant of concession of anticipatory

bail.

             Counsel for the petitioner submits that he has no

objection if such course of action is followed.

</p><p id="p_10">             In the circumstances, in case the petitioner appears

before the Investigating Officer on 06.05.2016 and give her sample

signatures/thumb impression, the Investigating Officer shall confirm

the bail and the petition shall stand allowed and in the event of the

petitioner not appearing before the Investigating Officer, the petition

would be deemed to have been dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_11">             Petition stands disposed of in the above terms.

             Since the main case has been decided, the pending

criminal miscellaneous application, if any, also stands disposed of.
