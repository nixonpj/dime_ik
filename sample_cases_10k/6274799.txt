respondent State.</pre>
<p id="p_1">      Shri   Kamla    Kishore   Gupta,    learned   counsel      for   the
complainant.
</p><p id="p_2">      Shri Nilesh Sharma, learned counsel for the objector.
      This is the first bail application under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_1">section 439</a> of the Cr.P.C
in crime no.158/2019 under <a href="/doc/1436241/" id="a_2">section 420</a>, <a href="/doc/1985627/" id="a_3">467</a>, <a href="/doc/556166/" id="a_4">468</a>, <a href="/doc/1466184/" id="a_5">471</a> and <a href="/doc/1897847/" id="a_6">120-B</a>,
<a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_7">34</a> of IPC registered at police station Sadalpur District Dhar.
</p><p id="p_3">2.    According to the prosecution case, father Salim Shaikh and
son Rehman Shaikh are proprietors of Industrial Painting Services
(IPS) and IPS Contractors and Labour Suppliers. As per agreement
with Volvo Eicher Commercial Vehicles Limited (VECV), they were
supplying skilled and unskilled labour to its Pithmapur plant since
past many years. The working system and practice in both the
suppliers and receiver company was that the supplier company
deputed one Nitin Singar to sit in the office of VECV and to reconcile
the data provided by the suppliers for payment of wages and salary
to the labourers supplied by the IPS. The petitioner was Junior
Manager in VECV with a duty to scrutinize, verify and pass for
payment the bills submitted by the suppliers IPS Company. The
attendance of the labourers were being taken by the punching and
thumb impression electronically through HIRAL System (the
attendance system of VECV). Some other officials of VECV
company were part of process of preparation, scrutiny and
verification of attendance of the labourers supplied by the
complainant company. Somewhere in December, 2018, it was found
that there was some mismatch in the data of the labourers supplied
by the IPS company and the payment made by VECV company and
on enquiry, it was found that about Rs.53,00,000/- were paid in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                       2 MCRC No.30782/2019</span>

access on account of 378 labourers, which were never supplied by
the IPS company, therefore, VECV company recovered this amount
from the supplier IPS company.
</p><p id="p_4">3.    The complainant/supplier IPS company enquired the matter
and found that the present petitioner along with some other officials
of both the companies were principally involved in the alleged fraud.
Therefore he filed FIR, which is registered against the petitioner and
other co-accused persons.
</p><p id="p_5">4.    Nitin Singar was interrogated by the company (IPS) who in his
hand written apology/confession admitted that he along with the
present petitioner had interpolated, manipulated and fabricated the
records and they both instrumented the access payment on account
of labourers never supplied to the VECV by the IPS company, which
was later recovered by VECV company from the IPS company.
</p><p id="p_6">5.    Nitin Singar further revealed in his hand written statement that
their modus operandi was that they have opened bank accounts in
the name of fake labourers and also obtained their ATM cards. They
later showed that the IPS company had supplied those labourers
and prepared and passed their bills etc and got the payment
deposited in their accounts. They used to withdraw the amount
deposited in those fake accounts by using ATM Cards already
procured by them at the time of opening of the bank accounts.
</p><p id="p_7">6.    It is submitted by learned counsel for the petitioner that none
of the witnesses, whose statement have been recorded under
<a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_8">Section 161</a> of Cr.PC have named the present petitioner or have
alleged anything against him showing his criminality or involvement
in the alleged crime; therefore he be granted bail.
</p><p id="p_8">7.    Objections of the opponent are that the petitioner was
Supervisor in the Supplier Company IPS. His duty was to permit
labourers to enter in their place of duty and to certify their
attendance and he has certified attendance of several fake
labourers, which was never supplied by IPS Company. It is further
pleaded that there was nexus between the petitioner and the main

          accused Nitin Singar. They both were extracting money by illegal
          means as many as 50 entries/transaction are pointed out by
          counsels of objectors showing periodical transfer of certain amounts
          by Nitin Singar to the account of the present petitioner which shows
          obnoxious connection between both of them; therefore, it is prayed
          that he be not granted bail.
</p><p id="p_9">          8.        In reply, learned counsel for the petitioner has admitted that
          the petitioner was employee of IPS Company.
</p><p id="p_10">          9.        No explanation is given by the learned counsel for the
          petitioner in respect of the banking transactions or transfer of certain
          amount periodically by Nitin Singar in favour of the present
          petitioner Jeevan.
</p><p id="p_11">          10.       At this stage, learned counsel for the petitioner prays for
          withdrawal of the petition.
</p><p id="p_12">          11.       Prayer is granted.
</p><p id="p_13">          12.       The petition is dismissed as withdrawn.
