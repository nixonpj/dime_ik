</p><p id="p_2">                            2.       The case of the prosecution is that on 25.05.2018 at bouat 1.30

                      p.m the petitioner along with others blocked the road and protested against

                      the arrest of the DMK leader M.K.Stalin and to close the sterlite factory. On

                      the basis of the above said allegation, the respondent police registered the

                      complaint and filed a First Information Report against the petitioner and

                      others for the offences under <a href="/doc/1599401/" id="a_2">Sections 341</a>, <a href="/doc/1096965/" id="a_3">143</a>, and <a href="/doc/1432790/" id="a_4">188</a> IPC in Crime No.

                      709 of 2018.
</p>
<p id="p_3">

</p><p id="p_4">                            3.       The learned counsel appearing for the petitioner submitted that

                      the petitioner is innocent. According to <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_5">Section 195(1)(a)</a> of Cr.P.C., no Court

                      can take cognizance of an offence under <a href="/doc/1432790/" id="a_6">Section 188</a> of IPC, unless the public

                      servant has written order from the authority. Further he submitted that the

                      petitioner or any other members had never involved in any unlawful assembly

                      and there is no evidence that the petitioner or others restrained anybody.

                      However, the officials of the respondent police had beaten the petitioners and

                      others. When there was lot of members involved in the protest, the

                      respondent police had registered this case, under <a href="/doc/1599401/" id="a_7">Section 341</a>, <a href="/doc/1096965/" id="a_8">143</a>, and <a href="/doc/1432790/" id="a_9">188</a>

                      IPC as against the petitioner and others. Therefore, he sought for quashing

                      the proceeding.

                      submitted that on 25.05.2018 at bouat 1.30 p.m the petitioner along with

                      others blocked the road and protested against the arrest of the DMK leader

                      M.K.Stalin and to close the sterlite factory and there are specific allegations as

                      against the petitioners to proceed with the trial. Further, he would submit

                      that <a href="/doc/1432790/" id="a_10">Section 188</a> of IPC is a cognizable offence and therefore it is the duty of

                      the police to register a case. Though there is a bar under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_11">Section 195(a)(i)</a> of

                      Cr.P.C. to take cognizance for the offence under <a href="/doc/1432790/" id="a_12">Section 188</a> of IPC, it does

                      not mean that the police cannot register FIR and investigate the case.

                      Therefore, he vehemently opposed the quash petition and prayed for

                      dismissal of the same.

                      1.30 p.m the petitioner along with others blocked the road and protested

                      against the arrest of the DMK leader M.K.Stalin and to close the sterlite

                      factory without permission      getting prior permission from the concerned

                      authority. Therefore     the respondent police levelled the charges under

                      Except the official witnesses, no one has spoken about the occurrence and no

                      one was examined to substantiate the charges against the petitioner. It is

                      also seen from the charge itself that the charges are very simple in nature

                      and trivial. <a href="/doc/1432790/" id="a_16">Section 188</a> reads as follows:

</p><p id="p_12">                            7.     The only question for consideration is that whether the

                      registration of case under <a href="/doc/1599401/" id="a_17">Sections 341</a>,<a href="/doc/1096965/" id="a_18">143</a>, <a href="/doc/1432790/" id="a_19">188</a> IPC, registered by the

                      respondent is permissible under law or not? In this regard it is relevant to

                      extract <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_20">Section 195(1)(a)</a> of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 :-


http://www.judis.nic.in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                                                 5</span>

                                   “195.Prosecution for contempt of lawful authority of public
                                   servants, for offences against public justice and for offences

</p><p id="p_13">                                           (a) (i) of any offence punishable under sections 172 to

                      Therefore, it is very clear that for taking cognizance of the offences under

                      <a href="/doc/1432790/" id="a_21">Section 188</a> of IPC, the public servant should lodge a complaint in writing and

                      other than that no Court has power to take cognizance.

</p><p id="p_16">                            8.     In the case on hand, the First Information Report has been

                      registered by the respondent police for the offences under <a href="/doc/1599401/" id="a_22">Sections 341</a>,<a href="/doc/1096965/" id="a_23">143</a>

                      and <a href="/doc/1432790/" id="a_24">188</a> IPC . He is not a competent person to register FIR for the offences

                      under <a href="/doc/1432790/" id="a_25">Section 188</a> of IPC. As such, the First Information Report or final report

                      is liable to be quashed for the offences under <a href="/doc/1432790/" id="a_26">Section 188</a> of IPC. Further, the

                      complaint does not even state as to how the protest formed by the petitioner

                      and others is an unlawful protest and does not satisfy the requirements of

                      <a href="/doc/1096965/" id="a_27">Section 143</a> of IPC. Therefore, the final report cannot be sustained and it is

                      liable to be quashed.
