HIGH COURT OF JUDICATURE AT ALLAHABAD
 
 

?Court No. - 5
 

 
Case :- WRIT - A No. - 17644 of 2019
 

 
Petitioner :- Veer Pal
 
Respondent :- Janardhan And Another
 
Counsel for Petitioner :- Abhishe Pandey
 
Counsel for Respondent :- Manoj Kumar Rai
 

 
Hon'ble Surya Prakash Kesarwani,J.
</pre> 
<p id="p_1">1- Heard Sri Akhtar Ali holding brief of Sri Abhishek Pandey, learned counsel for the defendant-petitioner and Sri Manoj Rai, learned counsel for the plaintiffs-respondents.
</p> 
<p id="p_2">2- This writ petition has been filed praying for the following relief:
</p> 
<p id="p_3">"(i)issue a writ, order or direction in the nature of certiorari quashing the impugned judgment and order dated 15.10.2019 passed by the Additional District Judge (Court No.7), Saharanpur as well as the impugned judgment and order dated 8.3.2019 passed by the Small Cause Court, Saharanpur (Annexure No. 6 and 4 to this writ petition ).
</p> 
<p id="p_4">(ii) issue a writ, order or direction in the nature of mandamus commanding the respondents not to create any interference in the peaceful possession of the petitioner over the shop in question situated in village Badgaon, Pargana and Tehsil Rampur Maniharan, District Saharanpur.
</p> 
<p id="p_5">(iii) issue any writ, order or direction which the Hon'ble Court may deem fit and proper in the present circumstances of the case.
</p> 
<p id="p_6">(iv) award the cost of the petition".
</p> 
<p id="p_7">3- Learned counsel for the defendant-petitioner submits that the petitioner is not the tenant of the disputed shop, but he is the owner of the disputed shop, which he has purchased from one Sri Adesh without any sale-deed. He, therefore, submits that since the defendant-petitioner is owner of the shop, therefore, in the absence of landlord-tenant relationship between tenant-petitioner and plaintiffs-respondents, both the courts below have committed manifest error of law to decree the eviction suit. 
</p> 
<p id="p_8">4-Learned counsel for the plaintiffs-respondents supports the impugned judgments.
</p> 
<p id="p_9">5- I have carefully considered the submissions of the learned counsels for the parties. 
</p> 
<p id="p_10">6- The only point argued before me by the learned counsel for the defendant-petitioner is that the defendant-petitioner is the owner of the disputed shop and not the tenant. Both the courts below have recorded concurrent findings of fact based on consideration of relevant evidences on record including examination-in-chief of the defendant-petitioner (Paper No.56Ga-2), that the defendant-petitioner is the tenant and the plaintiff-respondent is the landlord of the disputed shop. This being a finding of fact based on consideration of relevant evidences on record, cannot be interfered with in writ jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India. 
</p> 
<p id="p_11">7- That apart, perusal of the impugned judgments show that the defendant-petitioner has admitted not only in paragraph-18 of the written statement but also in his examination-in-chief (Paper No.56Ga-2), that he is the tenant of the plaintiff no.2. The defendant-petitioner has also filed a Misc. Case No.26 of 2014 (Janardhan Sharma v. Veer Pal), under Section 30 of U.P. Act No. XIII of 1972 for depositing rent of the disputed house. These facts leave no manner of doubt that the defendant-petitioner is the tenant and the plaintiff-respondent is the landlord of the disputed shop. Therefore, I do not find any good reason to interfere with the findings of fact recorded by the courts below. 
</p> 
<p id="p_12">8- For all the reasons afore-stated, I do not find any merit in this writ petition. Consequently, the petition fails and is hereby dismissed.
</p> 
<p id="p_13">Order Date :- 11.11.2019
