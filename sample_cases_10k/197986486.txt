Balwinder Singh                                             .. Petitioner

                                Versus

State of Punjab and others                                 .. Respondents</pre>

<p id="p_1">CORAM: HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE HARSIMRAN SINGH SETHI

Present:     Mr. Harbans Lal Sharma, Advocate, for the petitioner.

HARSIMRAN SINGH SETHI, J.(ORAL)

             In the present writ petition, though the petitioner is claiming

interest on the payment of gratuity and commutation of pension which were

paid to him after two months of his retirement but the at time of arguments,

petitioner restricts his claim for the payment of leave encashment, GIS and

GPF, which are yet to be released to the petitioner.

</p><p id="p_2">             Learned counsel for the petitioner states that there is no

impediment in the release of the pensionary benefits as there are no

proceedings pending, either departmental or criminal against the petitioner

which would entitle the respondents to withhold the pensionary benefits.

</p><p id="p_3">             Learned counsel for the petitioner states that for the relief as

claimed in the present writ petition, the petitioner has served the

respondents with a representation dated 20.03.2019 (Annexure P-7) which

is pending consideration with the respondents. It will be appropriate, at this

stage, in case a time bound direction is issued to the respondents to decide

the said representation by passing an appropriate speaking order within a

period of three months from the receipt of copy of this order.

             Without commenting upon the merits of the case or about the

entitlement of the petitioner for the relief which has been claimed by him in

the representation dated 20.03.2019 (Annexure P-7),              the present writ

petition is disposed of with a direction to the respondents to decide the

representation dated 20.03.2019 (Annexure P-7) within a period of three

months from the receipt of certified copy of this order.

</p><p id="p_5">             In case, it is found that the petitioner is entitled for the release

of the leave encashment, GIS and GPF, the same shall be released to the

petitioner within one month thereafter.

<p id="p_6">             However, it is made clear that this Court expresses no opinion

on the merits of the case or the entitlement of the claim as being raised by

the petitioner in the present writ petition.</p><pre id="pre_2">
