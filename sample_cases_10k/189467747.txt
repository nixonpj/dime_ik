                         Suit for Recovery of Rs.5,68,209/-


JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">                  This judgment shall dispose of the suit filed by the plaintiff
for recovery of Rs.5,68,209/- towards balance principal sum together
with accrued interest @ 18.5% and pendentelite and future interest
@24%.
</p>

<p id="p_2">1.                Briefly stated case of the plaintiff is that Indian Airlines is
statutory corporation established under Section 3 of Indian Airlines Act
and is a body corporate having perpetual succession and common
seal. Mr. V.S. Raghvan, Manager (Personal Service) has been
authorised on behalf of plaintiff corporation to sign, verify the plaint and
institute the suit to recover the dues on behalf of the plaintiff and
against the defendants.
</p>

<p id="p_3">2.                Defendants no. 2 to 4 are the Directors of defendant no. 1
company duly incorporated under the provision of <a href="/doc/257409/" id="a_1">Indian Companies
Act</a>. It has been further mentioned that plaintiff corporation engaged
and appointed defendant company as its approved agent for selling
Indian Airlines Tickets w.e.f. 16.12.1988 vide letter dated 30.011.1988.
The said appointment was on credit basis and as such defendant
company furnished security by way of bank guarantee of Rs.7,00,000/-
under the said agreement. Defendants were authorised to sell Indian
Airlines tickets for and on behalf of the plaintiff corporation w.e.f.
16.12.1988 and detail account showing the sale of tickets done by the
defendants were required to be submitted every fortnightly to the
plaintiff corporation along with sale proceeds regularly. For the above
CS No. 10084/16     M/s Indian Airlines   vs.   M/s Nouvelle Travel Mart (P) Ltd.   Page No. 2 of 11
 services i.e. sale of ticket fixed commission on the valuation of the
ticket was payable to the defendant company by the plaintiff
corporation.
</p>

<p id="p_4">3.                It has been alleged that under the terms and conditions of
the contract of appointment the defendant was required to submit
statement of sale of ticket every fortnightly along with remittance of
sale proceeds of tickets sold by the defendant company regularly.
However, defendant failed to submit the statement of sale of ticket for
the fortnight period ending 31.07.1991 and for the period commencing
from 01.08.1991 to 15.08.1991. The defendants defaulted in remitting
the sale proceed of the ticket sold by the defendants for the aforesaid
fortnight. Thus defendants owe a sum of Rs.11,70,990/- on account of
unpaid amount towards sale of tickets for the aforesaid period. It has
been further mentioned that on crediting and debiting the various
amounts for the various periods in the accounts of defendants, a sum
of Rs.11,56,439/- was due and payable towards principal sum by the
defendant to the plaintiff corporation. It has been further stated that
transaction between the parties was purely commercial in nature and
as such defendants are liable to pay interest on the said amount
@18.5% per annum and thus a sum of Rs.96,574/- was debited to the
accounts of defendants towards interest upto 31.07.1992.
</p>

<p id="p_5">4.                It has been further mentioned that plaintiff bank invoked
the bank guarantee and the proceeds of bank guarantee amounting to
Rs.5,53,013/- was appropriated towards the outstanding. It has been
further mentioned that on 26.11.1992 a sum of Rs.43,406/- was
disbursed to the plaintiff corporation on behalf of the defendants by
IATA, Singapore which amount was duly credited to the account of
defendants, leaving balance dues of Rs.5,09,607/-. It has been
mentioned that defendants are jointly and severally liable to pay a sum

CS No. 10084/16    M/s Indian Airlines   vs.   M/s Nouvelle Travel Mart (P) Ltd.   Page No. 3 of 11
 of Rs.58,602/- on account of dishonorment of two cheques with reason
not arranged for by banker and thus plaintiff has filed the present suit
to claim the amount of Rs.5,68,209/-after issuing legal notice dated
20.01.1992 demanding the said amount Rs.5,68,209/- but neither any
reply nor any payment has been received except by defendant No. 3
and 4. Hence, plaintiff has filed the present suit for recovery of said
amount.
</p>

<p id="p_6">5.                Notice of the suit was sent to the defendants, however,
despite service defendants no. 1 and 2 neither appeared nor filed
written statement and accordingly they were proceeded against ex-
parte. Defendants no. 3 and 4 filed separate written statements
thereby raising preliminary objection that suit is not maintainable; suit
is bad for misjoinder of parties as defendant no. 3 is neither a Director
of defendant no. 1 nor a guarantor in any manner; that the plaintiff did
not approach the court with clean hands; the plaintiff has not disclosed
that plaintiff was duly informed regarding the resignation of defendant
no. 3 w.e.f. 01.05.1989. The resolution to this effect was passed on
29.04.1989 and was duly approved by the Chairperson of defendant
no. 1 and Bank and RoC was duly intimated about the same. It has
been mentioned that Resolution dated 29.04.1989 clearly speaks
beyond the shadow of any doubt that Resignation Letter dated
15.04.1989 submitted by defendant no. 3 was accepted by the
company w.e.f. 01.05.1989.
</p>

<p id="p_7">6.                It has been mentioned that plaintiff was accordingly
informed about the resignation of defendant no. 3 from defendant no.
</p><p id="p_8">1. It has been further mentioned that Sh. Manjit Singh as Managing
Director of defendant no. 1 not only informed IATA but also to the
agency Interline Panel-9 (India) regarding the necessary information of
the resignation of Sh. J.P. singh defendant no. 3. It has been pleaded

CS No. 10084/16    M/s Indian Airlines   vs.   M/s Nouvelle Travel Mart (P) Ltd.   Page No. 4 of 11
 that since defendant no. 3 resigned from the company w.e.f.
01.05.1989 defendant no. 3 is neither personally nor constructively
liable and hence, suit is not maintainable against him. On merits,
defendant no. 3 has questioned authority of Sh. V.S. Raghvan to
institute the present suit on behalf of the plaintiff and entire contents of
the plaintiff has been denied.
</p>

<p id="p_9">7.                In the written statement of defendant no. 4 similar stand
has been taken. He too submitted that he had resigned from defendant
no. 1 and his resignation is effective from 01.05.1989 and that other
concerned authorities were duly informed including RoC.
</p>

<p id="p_10">8.                From the pleadings of the parties following issues were
framed vide order dated 11.03.2002:-
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_1">              1. Whether the suit has been filed, signed and verified by the
                  duly authorised person? OPP
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">              2. Whether the suit is bad for misjoinder of parties as per
                  preliminary objection of the written statement?
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">              3. Whether the defendants are jointly and severally liable for
                  the suit amount?
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">              4. Whether the plaintiff is entitled to recover any amount, if
                  so, to what amount and at what rate?
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">              5. Relief


</blockquote><p id="p_11">9.                In support of its case plaintiff examined Mr. Joginder Singh
as PW1 who filed his affidavit in examination in chief Ex. PW1/A and
relied upon various documents. He was cross-examined by the
defendants. Thereafter, plaintiff closed its evidence.
</p>

<p id="p_12">10.               Defendant no. 3 examined himself as DW-1 and filed his

CS No. 10084/16    M/s Indian Airlines   vs.   M/s Nouvelle Travel Mart (P) Ltd.   Page No. 5 of 11
 affidavit in examination in chief Ex. DW1/A.
</p>

<p id="p_13">11.               During the pendency name of plaintiff changed and it
became National Aviation Company of India Ltd. and subsequently it
became Air India Limited.
</p>

<p id="p_14">12.               Defendant no. 4 expired and his LR i.e. defendant no. 3
was already on record.
</p>

<p id="p_15">13.               After appreciating pleadings, evidence, material on record
and arguments of Ld. Counsel for the parties, issues wise findings are
as under:-
</p>

<p id="p_16">ISSUE No. 1:      Whether the suit has been filed, signed and
verified by the duly authorised person? OPP

</p><p id="p_17">14.               Onus to prove this issue is upon the plaintiff. Plaintiff
witness in his examination-in-chief did not depose a single word about
the person who signed, verified and instituted the plaint and about said
person's authority. Plaintiff also did not place on record any document
to show that Mr. V.S. Raghvan was the Principal Officer of the plaintiff
company. There is no cross-examination on this point nor any
suggestion has been given to this effect. Since onus is upon the
plaintiff, therefore, it was required of the plaintiff to lead some evidence
on record to prove the authority of the person who has signed, verified
and instituted the present plaint. Hon'ble Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/1555740/" id="a_2">Union
Bank of India vs. Naresh &amp; Ors</a> AIR 1997 Supreme Court 3 held
that where suits are instituted or defended on behalf of public
corporation, public interest should not be permitted to be
defeated on a mere technicality. Procedural defects which do not
go to the root of the matter should not be permitted to defeat the
just cause. There is sufficient power in the courts, under the code
CS No. 10084/16    M/s Indian Airlines   vs.   M/s Nouvelle Travel Mart (P) Ltd.   Page No. 6 of 11
 of Civil Procedure, to ensure that injustice is not done to any
party who had a just case. As far as possible a substantive right
should not be allowed to be defeated on account of a procedural
irregularity which is curable. It was further held that in cases
where pleadings have been signed by one of its officer a
Corporation can ratify the said action of its officer in signing the
pleadings. Such ratification can be expressed or implied. The
court, on the basis of the evidence on record, and after taking all
the circumstance of the case, specially with regard to the conduct
of the trial, can come to the conclusion that Corporation had
ratified the act of signing of the pleadings by it's officer.
</p>

<p id="p_18">15.               Since plaintiff has been continuing with the present suit
and deputing its officer not only for the conducting the case but also
deputed its officer/person to depose on behalf of the plaintiff goes to
show that plaintiff has ratified the act of officer who has signed the
present plaint on behalf of the plaintiff and therefore, impliedly goes to
show that suit has been instituted by an officer of the plaintiff who was
authorised to do so or whose act has been ratified.
</p><p id="p_19">                  Hence, issue no. 1 is decided in favour of the plaintiff and
against the defendant.
</p>

<p id="p_20">ISSUE No. 2 :-   Whether the suit is bad for misjoinder of parties
as per preliminary objection of the written statement?
</p>
<p id="p_21">ISSUE No. 3 :-      Whether the defendants are jointly and severally
liable for the suit amount?
</p>
<p id="p_22">16.               Both the issues are taken up together as they are inter
connected and requires appreciation of same facts and evidence. It
has already been noted above that defendants no. 1 and 2 have not
contested the matter. Therefore, so far as submission of the plaintiff
against the defendant no. 1 is concerned that has gone undisputed as

CS No. 10084/16    M/s Indian Airlines   vs.   M/s Nouvelle Travel Mart (P) Ltd.   Page No. 7 of 11
 defendants no. 1 and 2 did not contest the present matter. Plaintiff has
placed on record the appointment letter dated 30.11.1992 Ex. PW1/3,
certificate of appointment dated 16.12.1988 Ex. PW1/4, Statement of
sales and refund for the period 16.07.1991 to 31.07.1991 Ex. PW1/5 to
Ex./ PW1/15, Statement of sales and refund for the period from
01.08.1991 to 15.08.1991 Ex. PW1/16 to ex. PW1/23, Statement of
Account Ex. PW1/27 to Ex. PW1/31, Statement showing the details of
amount due from defendant no. 1 Ex. PW1/15. All this goes to show
that the amount claimed by the plaintiff is due against the defendant
no. 1 and contents thereof have gone unrebutted and unchallenged so
far as defendants no. 1 and 2 are concerned.
</p>

<p id="p_23">17.               So far as defendants no. 3 and 4 are concerned they have
pleaded that they resigned from defendant no. 1 on 29.04.1989 which
was duly accepted by defendant no. 1 effective from 01.05.1989.
Defendant summoned the record from RoC and witness DW-2 brought
the summoned record i.e. Form No. 32 as per which Form 32 record
was submitted by defendants no. 3 and 4 in the office of RoC on
12.05.1989. It has been further mentioned that other documents such
as resignation from Director with copies of other documents submitted
by defendant No. 3 and defendant No. 4 were received on 22.05.1989.
He exhibited the Form as Ex. DW2/1. He also brought the copy of
resignation submitted by defendants no. 3 and 4 along with Board
Resolution Ex. DW2/2 (colly.) and DW2/3 (colly.).
</p>

<p id="p_24">18.               In cross-examination of DW2 no suggestion was given that
defendants no. 3 and 4 have not submitted their resignation or that
Form no. 32 was not issued or that record brought by the witness was
not of RoC or that there is not such record in the RoC.
</p>

<p id="p_25">19.               Defendant also examined one Record Keeper from Debtt
Recovery Tribunal- III who brought the record of TA No. 43/02 and DRT
CS No. 10084/16    M/s Indian Airlines   vs.   M/s Nouvelle Travel Mart (P) Ltd.   Page No. 8 of 11
 III (4.A. No. 749/95) and suit no. 741/93 of Delhi High Court titled as
<a href="/doc/1373507/" id="a_3">Punjab &amp; Sind Bank vs. M/s Novel Mart Ltd. &amp; ors. Final</a> order passed
on 26.02.2004 in the said case by DRT was exhibited as Ex. DW3/1
wherein defendant No. 3 and 4 were party therein as respondent No. 4
and 5 respectively and DRT based on resignation letter dismissed the
claim of the Bank therein against defendants no. 3 and 4 herein.
</p>

<p id="p_26">20.               Admittedly defendants no. 3 and 4 has specifically proved
resignation from defendant no. 1 in the year 1989 itself i.e. w.e.f.
01.05.1989 whereas present transaction involved in the suit are of
period of July and August 1991. Therefore, defendants no. 3 and 4 are
not even remotely could be said to have acted in the transaction under
dispute. Defendants no. 3 and 4 having resigned from the defendant
no. 1 cannot be held personally liable at least for the transaction
having taken place after their resignation. Hence, defendants no. 3 and
4 were neither necessary nor proper parties. Hence, the suit is bad for
misjoinder of the party.
</p>

<p id="p_27">21.               It is otherwise settled principle of law that company is a
juristic person in itself and in order to make the Director of the
defendant's company personally liable some specific allegations has to
be levelled against the Directors so as to make them liable and in order
to invoke the "lifting of corporate veil" plaintiff must plead and prove the
grounds in the plaint requiring "lifting of corporate veil". Bare perusal of
the plaint of the present case shows that no allegation of personal
nature has been leveled against any of the directors and no ground
has been set up for "lifting of corporate veil". If no ground for lifting of
corporate veil is pleaded the Directors are personally not liable in civil
matters, therefore, Directors cannot be made jointly and severally
liable in the absence of specific pleadings and evidence to this effect.
</p>

defendants no. 3 and 4 are not liable for any liabilities of the Company.
</p><p id="p_30">                  Hence, issues no. 2 and 3 are decided against the plaintiff
and in favour of defendants no. 3 and 4.

amount, if so, to what amount and at what rate?

<p id="p_32">23.               Onus to prove this issue is upon the plaintiff. Plaintiff has
already duly proved that defendant No.1 was duly appointed for sale of
tickets and has failed to furnish statement of accounts of sale of tickets
for the period w.e.f. 16.07.1991 to 15.08.1991. Plaintiff has also
successfully proved that a sum of Rs.5,68,209/- was due against the
defendant no. 1. Accordingly, plaintiff is entitled to recover the said
sum. As defendant no. 1 is not contesting the present matter nor its
Director defendant no. 2 has contested the present matter. Accordingly,
plaintiff is entitled to recover the said amount from defendant no. 1 and
from defendant no. 2 to the extent to which he is liable as the Director
of the company under the Companies Law. Admittedly the transaction
between the parties is of commercial in nature and therefore, plaintiff is
entitled compensation by way of interest for the period for which it
remained deprived of the said amount.

<p id="p_33">24.               Section 34 of CPC provides for grant of interest pendente-
lite at any rate not exceeding 6% and future interest at any rate not
exceeding contractual rate and if there is no contractual rate than not
exceeding the rate at which nationalised banks advance loan. Keeping
in mind the said provision interest of justice would be served if plaintiff
is granted simple interest @ 6% per annum from the date of institution
of the suit till the passing of decree till its realization.
