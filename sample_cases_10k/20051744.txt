alleged      willful   disobedience      of   order    dated
23.09.2015 passed in Writ Petition No.6385/2015.
The said Writ Petition was for direction for grant of
regular pay-scale on the anvil that the petitioner
had already been granted permanent classification
in the year 2005 (vide order dated 15.06.2005).
The said writ petition was disposed of in the terms
of   order     passed    by    the   Division   Bench      in
W.A.No.110/2011. The direction by Writ Court in
Writ Petition was that the order passed in WA
No.110/2011 shall apply mutatis mutandis.
</p><p id="p_7">      Be it noted, the Writ Petition No.6385/2015
was disposed of at motion hearing stage without
adjudicating the claim of the petitioner of having
been classified permanent on completion of 240
days. Such a permanent classification has since
been held to be erroneous [Please See decisions in
State of M.P. and others Vs. Lalit                    Kumar
Verma [(2007) 1 SCC 575], Mahendra L. Jain

[(2006) 2 SCC 702]. Be that as it may.

mutatis mutandis to be followed was in the
following terms:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">       "(1) The petitioner shall file a fresh
       representation before respondents along

             Conc.1222.16 and Conc.848.15

     with the proof of acquiring permanent
     status by way of classification. The
     respondents shall verify and if petitioner's
     permanent status remains intact, he shall
     be given similar treatment, i.e., grant of
     regular pay scale attached to the
     permanent post from the date of
     classification as permanent employee.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">     (2) The respondents shall also grant
     increments attached to the pay scale and if
     rules permit, extend benefit of DA in
     favour of the petitioner.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">     (3) The respondents shall also pass a
     speaking order regarding claim of grant of
     seniority to the petitioner from the date of
     classification as permanent employee.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">     (4) If for any justifiable reason, the
     petitioner is not found entitled for any of
     the benefits claimed, a detailed and
     reasoned      order   be     passed    and
     communicated to the petitioner. The
     aforesaid exercise be completed within
     120 days from the date of production of
     copy of this order along with the
     representation.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">     (5) It is made clear that it will not be open
     to the respondents to deny relief to the
     petitioners on the ground that they were
     not litigants in W.A. No. 1266/2010 and
     other similar matters, which were decided
     on merits, if they are otherwise similarly
     situated. Petition is disposed of."

the authorities to verify the status of the petitioner
being that of permanent 'remains intact'.

       The    respondents         (present      appellants)      on
receiving representation examined the same as to
the entitlement of the petitioner for permanent
classification. The petitioner was issued show
cause notice on 28.01.2017 that the classification
was doubtful because it was found that the
petitioner was not appointed as per recruitment
rules, nor was he appointed against vacant post.
The competent authority after considering the
reply passed an order on 08.02.2017; whereby the
petitioner was not found eligible for permanent
classification immediately on completion of 240
days on daily wages. The competent authority after
determining the status of the petitioner, went on to
examine        his    case      under       the     scheme        of
regularization of daily wagers brought in vogue

respondents "with calculated intentions, intended

the Supreme Court and thereby have made inroads

<p id="p_16">     The present case falls in the category of the
exception carved out by the Hon'ble Supreme
Court i.e. such direction or decision which is
incidental to or inextricably connected with the
order punishing for contempt. In view whereof, the
preliminary objection as to maintainability of the
appeal is overruled.
</p><p id="p_17">     As to the facts of the case, evidently, learned
Single Judge in WP.6385/2015 did not adjudicate
the right of the petitioner nor of his status as being
classified as permanent. The Writ Court only
recorded the submission and directed that the
authorities concerned to consider the claim in the
light of the direction issued by the Division Bench
in WA.110.2011, thus, leaving the discretion with
the authorities to consider the status of the
petitioner and if found eligible to extend all the
benefits he would be entitled for as per said status.
The authorities concerned did consider the claim
and having found that the alleged conferral of
permanent     classification   being     de   hors       the
Standard Standing Order and the law laid down by
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                               9</span>

    Conc.810.16, Conc.812.16, Conc.814.16, Conc.816.16,
              Conc.1222.16 and Conc.848.15

Supreme Court went on to further examine the
status and entitlement under new policy. As the
petitioner was found eligible under the new policy
he has been extended with all the benefits. The
petitioner if he had any grievance against such
decision was at liberty to have questioned its
validity before appropriate forum. Instead, alleging
willful   disobedience,      the   petitioner   filed     the
contempt petition which is in our considered
opinion was ill-advised.
</p><p id="p_18">     It is manifestly clear from the order passed by
learned     Single   Judge    in   the   Contempt       Case
No.1222/2016 that the the claim of the petitioner
was examined on merit. This would be evident
from the findings in paragraph 21 and 22 of the
decision. In view whereof, we are of the considered
opinion that learned Single Judge transgressed its
jurisdiction in a Contempt Petition.
</p><p id="p_19">     In our considered opinion, the contempt court
was only to examine whether the direction for
consideration has been carried out. It was not
required to consider the correctness of the order
on merit.
</p><p id="p_20">     It is held in Anil Kumar Shahi (2) and
others Vs. Prof. Ram Sevak Yadav and others
[(2008) 14 SCC 115]:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_7">      "50. It is by now well settled under the Act
      and under <a href="/doc/927019/" id="a_4">Article 129</a> of the Constitution
      of India that if it is alleged before this

             Conc.1222.16 and Conc.848.15

     Court that a person has willfully violated
     its order it can invoke its jurisdiction
     under the Act to enquire whether
     allegation is true or not and if found to be
     true it can punish the offenders for having
     committed "civil contempt" and if need be,
     can    pass    consequential    orders    for
     enforcement of execution of the order, as
     the case may be, for violation of which, the
     proceeding for contempt was initiated. In
     other words, while exercising its power
     under the Act, it is not open to the Court
     to pass an order, which will materially add
     to or alter the order for alleged
     disobedience      of    which      contempt
     jurisdiction was invoked. When the Court
     directs the authority to consider a matter
     in accordance with law, it means that the
     matter should be considered to the best of
     understanding by the authority and,
     therefore, a mere error of judgment with
     regard to the legal position cannot
     constitute contempt of Court. There is no
     willful disobedience if best efforts are
     made to comply with the order.</blockquote>

<p id="p_21">    In Dinesh Kumar Gupta Vs. United India
Insurance     Company        Limited      and     others
[(2010) 12 SCC 770], it is held:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_8">    "23. Besides this, it would also not be
    correct to overlook or ignore an important
    statutory ingredient of contempt of a civil
    nature given out under <a href="/doc/654554/" id="a_5">Section 2(b)</a> of the
    Contempt of Courts Act, 1971 that the
    disobedience to the order alleging
    contempt has to satisfy the test that it is a
    wilful disobedience to the order. Bearing
    this important factor in mind, it is relevant
    to note that a proceeding for civil
    contempt would not lie if the order alleged
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                           11</span>

Conc.810.16, Conc.812.16, Conc.814.16, Conc.816.16,
          Conc.1222.16 and Conc.848.15

 to have been disobeyed itself provides
 scope     for   reasonable    or    rational
 interpretation of an order or circumstance
 which is the factual position in the instant
 matter. It would equally not be correct to
 infer that a party although acting due to
 misapprehension of the correct legal
 position and in good faith without any
 motive to defeat or defy the order of the
 Court, should be viewed as a serious
 ground so as to give rise to a contempt
 proceeding.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_22"> 24. To reinforce the aforesaid legal
 position further, it would be relevant and
 appropriate to take into consideration the
 settled legal position as reflected in the
 judgment and order delivered in <a href="/doc/361886/" id="a_6">Ahmed
 Ali V. Supdt. District Jail</a> as also in <a href="/doc/76696826/" id="a_7">B.K. Kar
 V. High</a> Court of Orissa that mere
 unintentional disobedience is not enough
 to hold anyone guilty of contempt and
 although disobedience might have been
 established, absence of wilful disobedience
 on the part of the contemnor, will not hold
 him guilty unless the contempt involves a
 degree of fault or misconduct. Thus,
 accidental or unintentional disobedience is
 not sufficient to justify for holding one
 guilty of contempt. It is further relevant to
 bear in mind the settled law on the law of
 contempt that casual or accidental or
 unintentional acts of disobedience under
 the circumstances which negate any
 suggestion of contumacy, would amount to
 a contempt in theory only and does not
 render the contemnor liable to punishment
 and this was the view expressed also in
 State of Bihar Vs. Rani Sonabati Kumari
 and N. Baksi V. O.K. Ghosh."
