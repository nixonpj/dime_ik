                    Challenging    the    said   award       dated      28.09.2001   made     in

<p id="p_4">

</p><p id="p_5">                          4. The contention of the learned counsel appearing for the

                    appellant-Transport Corporation that the Tribunal erred in fixing the

                    entire negligence on the part of the driver of the bus and liability on the

                    appellant and that Tribunal ought to have fixed contributory negligence

                    on the part of the driver of the van who was rash and negligence and

                    solely responsible for the accident and the amounts awarded by the

                    Tribunal under different heads are excessive, are contrary to the

                    materials available on record. The Tribunal, considering the evidence of

                    R.W.1, driver of the bus, Ex.P1- FIR registered against the driver of the

                    bus, Ex.P4 - rough sketch and Ex.P5 â€“ Motor Vehicle Inspector's report,

                    held that the accident occurred only due to rash and negligent driving

                    by the driver of the bus.      The Tribunal, considering the oral and

                    documentary evidence in proper perspective, awarded a sum of

                    Rs.10,73,000/- as compensation to the respondents 1, 2 &amp; 5 under

                    different heads, which are just compensation and not excessive. In the

                    above circumstances, this court is not inclined to interfere with the said

                    award of the Tribunal warranting interference by this Court.

</p><p id="p_6">                          5. In the result, this Civil Miscellaneous Appeal is dismissed and

                    sum of Rs.10,73,000/- awarded by the Tribunal as compensation to the

                    respondents 1, 2 &amp; 5, along with interest and costs is confirmed. The

                    of the minor 2nd respondent is directed to be deposited in any one of the
