             Civil Writ Petition No.28466 of 2013                         {2}

                               On 28.07.2008, a show cause notice was served upon the

            petitioner, when was posted as Incharge of the Police Post Barwala levelling

            allegations that a small child of about two years of age, a son of Nepali

            labourer working at a Poultry Farm known as Amit Poultry Farm, Barwala,

            who had fallen in the water tank and died, when information in this regard

            was received by the petitioner, he along with one Constable Ram Pal

            reached there for taking necessary action. A compromise was got arrived at

            between the owner of Amit Poultry Farm, namely, Nitin Garg and the father

            of the deceased child, a Nepali labourer, named Ramdev, where a sum of

            `60,000/- was paid by the owner of the Poultry Farm to the labourer, who

            was allowed to go away to an unknown destination. Petitioner thereafter

            demanded and was given a sum of `25,000/- by Shri Nitin Garg, the owner

            of the Poultry Farm as illegal gratification for hushing up the matter.

</p><p id="p_4">                               Reply to the show cause notice was given by the petitioner, but

            the same was not found to be satisfactory and, therefore, a regular

            departmental enquiry was initiated against him. The Deputy Superintendent

            of Police, Head Office, Panchkula was appointed as the Enquiry Officer,

            who submitted his report on 28.07.2009, where the allegations against the

            petitioner were proved. On the basis of the enquiry report, a show cause

            notice dated 28.07.2008 was served upon the petitioner, to which he

            responded vide reply dated 11.08.2008. On considering the reply filed by

            the petitioner, the Superintendent of Police, Panchkula (punishing authority)

            came to the conclusion that the petitioner was not a fit person to be

            continued in service. The factum with regard to the eligibility of the

            petitioner for grant of pension was also taken into consideration, but

            keeping in view the proved allegations against the petitioner, which

            pertained to demand and acceptance of `25,000/- as bribe, the punishing

            authority came to the conclusion that no lenient view can be taken in such a

            matter and passed the order of dismissal vide order dated 19.08.2008

            (Annexure P-3). The appeal preferred by the petitioner was duly considered

            by the Inspector General of Police, Ambala Range, Ambala Cantt.-

            respondent No.3 and the same was dismissed vide order dated 10.10.2008

            (Annexure P-4). Petitioner thereafter preferred a revision before the Director

            General of Police, which again was considered on merits and rejected vide

            order dated 17.03.2009 (Annexure P-5). Petitioner, being not satisfied with

            that, thereafter preferred a mercy petition before the Government which

            again was rejected by the Financial Commissioner and Principal Secretary

            to Government of Haryana, Home Department, vide order dated 15.03.2010

            (Annexure P-6). The petitioner through the present writ petition is

            challenging these orders, apart from the adverse ACRs conveyed to him for

            the period 01.04.2008 to 19.08.2008 conveyed to him vide order dated

            10.04.2009 (Annexure P-7).
</p>
<p id="p_5">                               It is the contention of the counsel for the petitioner that the

            impugned order of dismissal from service passed by the Superintendent of

            Police, Panchkula dated 19.08.2008 and the consequential orders of

            rejection of his appeal, revision and mercy appeal cannot sustain in the

            light of the fact that the star witness of the respondents in the departmental

            enquiry, namely, Nitin Garg, who appeared as PW-5 and was owner of Amit

            Poultry Farm, Barwala has, in his cross-examination, stated that he had not

            paid any bribe to the petitioner. He contends that the defence witnesses also

            have supported the assertions of the petitioner that he had not demanded nor

            was he paid the amount of `25,000/- as bribe. He, on this basis, contends

            that the findings recorded by the Enquiry Officer are contrary to the

            evidence on record and the consequential orders of punishment etc., thus,

            cannot sustain.
</p>
<p id="p_6">                               His further contention is that the punishing authority has not

            taken into consideration the length of service and the earlier service record

            of the petitioner and, thus, the petitioner would be entitled to the pensionary

            benefits. He, on this basis, contends that the punishment of dismissal from

            service is too harsh and disproportionate to the allegations and the findings

            recorded by the punishment authority.
</p>
<p id="p_7">                               A prayer with regard to discrimination vis-a-vis petitioner has

            been sought to be raised on the plea that Constable Ram Pal, who was

            accompanying the petitioner and is stated to have been given a bribe of

            `2,000/- by Nitin Garg, has been imposed with a punishment of merely

            stoppage of two increments with cumulative effect, whereas petitioner has

            been dismissed from service. Prayer has, thus, been made for setting-aside

            the impugned orders and allowing the writ petition.

</p><p id="p_9">                               The star argument put forth by the counsel for the petitioner is

            that Nitin Garg son of Rakesh Garg (PW-5), who was the owner of Amit

            Poultry Farm, Barwala, has not supported the case of the prosecution and in

            the cross-examination has admitted that he has not given any bribe money to

            the petitioner. This contention of the counsel for the petitioner cannot be

                               I am the resident of above stated address and I have a poultry

                               farm in the name of Amit Poultry Farm, Barwala. One person

                               namely Ramdev, caste Rishidev, resident of Nepal was working

                               at my poultry farm, whose two years son had been died due to

                               sinking after falling in the dug of water which is built in the

                               poultry farm. That after receiving the information to the police,

                               ASI Jasmer Singh and Constable Rampal came there and

                               settled my matter with Ramdev Nepal in Rs.60,000/- and

                               recorded our statements. ASI Jasmer Singh took Rs.25,000/- as

<p id="p_14">                               A perusal of the question, referred to above, leaves no manner

            of doubt that the question put to the witness was whether bribe has been

            taken for taking any kind of police action through the petitioner. The answer

            obviously had to be `no' because the money was given for not taking police

            action. The answer, therefore, given by the witness to the question is in

            consonance with and supports the statement given by him during the

            enquiry proceedings and also in the affidavit dated 20.06.2008, which was

            marked as Ex.PW5/A and B. The question whether the police had put any

            pressure for a compromise, which has been answered in the negative, also

            does not help the case of the petitioner as the allegation against him with

            regard to the demand and taken of bribe stands proved by the statement of

            the witness.

<p id="p_15">                               The order of punishment imposed by the Superintendent of

            Police, Panchkula dated 19.08.2008 (Annexure P-3) is in accordance with

            law as while passing the order, the punishing authority has taken into

            consideration the length of service of the petitioner as also his earlier

            service record. The conclusion drawn by the punishment authority is fully

            justified as a police official, who has been found to have demanded and has

            been paid bribe, cannot be a fit person to be continued in service and the

            punishment of dismissal from service has been rightly imposed upon him.

            No lenient view in such matters is required to be taken.

            petitioner, being in consonance with law, do not call for any interference by

            this Court. The adverse confidential remarks conveyed to the petitioner vide

            order dated 10.04.2009 (Annexure P-7), being justified on the basis of the

            findings of the Enquiry Officer, also do not call for any interference.

</p><p id="p_17">                               A plea with regard to discrimination on the ground that

            Constable Rampal, who has been imposed punishment of stoppage of two

            increments with cumulative effect, whereas in the case of the petitioner he

            has been dismissed from service, does not require any weightage to be given

            by this Court. The quantum of punishment is to be decided by the competent

            authority and it is the discretion which has been so exercised by the said

            authority. The only observation with regard to the order dated 25.06.2009

            (Annexure P-8) passed in the departmental enquiry held against Constable

            Rampal is that a very lenient view has been taken by the punishing authority

            while passing such order. An employee that too of a police department has

            been found to be indulging in demanding and accepting bribe is not fit to be

            retained in service. Merely because a lesser punishment has been imposed in

            the case of a Constable, who was also involved in the acceptance of bribe

            along with the petitioner, cannot be a ground for dislodging a well reasoned

            and justified order of punishment imposed upon the petitioner when the

            evidence led during the enquiry proceedings substantiates the allegation of

            demand and acceptance of bribe against the petitioner.
