                                ORAL JUDGMENT
(Per: HONOURABLE MR JUSTICE NAVANITI PRASAD SINGH)

Date: 25-01-2016

                   Heard Shri Y V Giri, learned Senior Counsel for the appellants,
 Patna High Court LPA No.1300 of 2013 dt.25-01-2016

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                          2/3</span>




        who were respondents in the writ proceedings, Shri Rajendra Prasad Singh for the

        respondents who were petitioners in the writ proceedings and the learned counsel

        for the State

                         2 We have gone though the judgment of the learned Single Judge

        and we are not inclined to interfere in the matter.
</p>
<p id="p_17">                         3 With consent of parties, this appeal is being heard for its final

        disposal at this state itself.
</p>
<p id="p_18">                         4 The learned Single Judge has clearly noted the sequence of

        events in detail. The writ petitioners, who are respondents herein, had applied for

        and had been selected as Panchayat Shiksha Mitra prior to 2006. The respondents,

        in the writ proceedings, had not been so selected. Thus, on the day when the

        Primary Teachers (Selection and Service Conditions) Rules, 2006 came into being

        with effect from 01.07.2006, the writ petitioners, having been found working,

        were absorbed as Primary Teachers. The respondents/appellants complained

        before authorities and ultimately they came before this Court in the writ

        proceedings which was dismissed. They preferred Letters Patent Appeal which

        was allowed to be withdrawn with a liberty to move the appropriate authorities.
</p>
<p id="p_19">        All this was happening long after the respondents, who are writ petitioners, were

        absorbed as Primary Teachers and the post of Shiksha Mitra, for which fight was

        going on, stood abolished. The respondents, in this appeal, have been working

        since prior to 2006.
</p>
<p id="p_20">                         5 In such a situation, the post, having been abolished and the fact

        that the respondents have been working since prior to 2006, we are not inclined to

        interfere in the matter.
</p>
<p id="p_21">                         6 We may also notice that the appellants' case was that initially,

        in the year 2003, it was these appellants who have been selected but their services
         Patna High Court LPA No.1300 of 2013 dt.25-01-2016

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                                  3/3</span>




                had wrongly not been renewed any further, and, from 2004, it were the

                respondents in this appeal who had been selected and continued and subsequently

                absorbed.
</p>
<p id="p_22">                                 7 Be that as it may, all these disputes are being sought to be raised

                and inquiries made after the post of Shiksha Mitra, on which they were initially

                appointed, stood abolished.
</p>
<p id="p_23">                                 8    We, thus, find no reason to interfere. This appeal is,

                accordingly, dismissed.
</p>
