AND

The Assistant Engineer (Electrical)
O &amp; M Division, BESCOM,
Molakalmuru Taluk,
Chitradurga District - 577 535.                ... RESPONDENT

(By Sri P.S. Dinesh Kumar, Adv.)

                                *******

       This writ petition is filed under Articles 226 &amp; 227 of the
Constitution of India, praying to quash the impugned
endorsement/ letter dated 29.11.2012 issued by the respondent
as per Annexure-A and consequently direct the respondent to
restore the power supply under meter No.H.L.4140 to the
petitioner's Canteen at Hanagal Village and etc.

     This petition is coming on for preliminary hearing in 'B'
group this day, the Court made the following:
                                 2



                            ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">1.    In this   writ petition, petitioner is challenging      the

communication dated 29.11.2012 issued by the respondent -

Assistant Engineer (Electrical), O&amp;M Division, Molakalmuru

Taluk, Chitradurga District. She has also sought for a

consequential direction to restore the power supply to the

petitioner's Canteen at Hanagal Village in Molakalmuru Taluk.


</p><p id="p_2">2.    It is the case of the petitioner that she is running a

Canteen in Sy. No. 116/2 of Hanagal Village. She has obtained

license from Hanagal Grama Panchayat to run the Canteen vide

Annexure-B dated 04.10.2012. The land where the canteen is

situated belongs to the joint family of one Sri Veeranna. The

land owner, Veeranna has entered into an oral agreement of

lease, leasing out the premises to the petitioner on a monthly

rent of   Rs.500/-.   However, due to some misunderstanding

between the petitioner and the owner with regard to the

enhancement of rent, the owner refused to collect the rent and

demanded possession.
</p>
<p id="p_3">
</p><p id="p_4">3.    It is alleged in the petition that at the instigation of the

land owner, the respondent has disconnected power supply to

the petitioner's Canteen, though the land owner had no right
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                 3</span>



whatsoever to interfere with the business of the petitioner. It is

further urged by the petitioner that respondent issued notice

dated     27.09.2012   demanding    production    of   agreement

pertaining to the schedule property within seven days from the

date of receipt of the notice. Subsequently, on 05.10.2012, the

electricity connection has been disconnected. She further

contends that similar action was resorted to against other

tenants who had occupied the adjoining premises, they

approached this Court in W.P.No.48257/2012 which was

allowed on 25.02.2013 directing restoration of the power

supply.
</p>
<p id="p_5">
</p><p id="p_6">4.      Learned counsel for the petitioner contends that as the

petitioner has been duly licensed to run the Canteen and has

been lawfully continuing the business of running the Canteen,

the respondent was not justified in disconnecting the power

supply at the instance of the land owner. It is his further

assertion that at the time when the power supply was given,

petitioner had furnished all necessary documents to the

respondent and it was only after submitting the said documents

and after due verification of the same, power supply was given,

therefore, there was no justification for the respondent to now
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                   4</span>



again demand agreement of lease or act on the basis of the land

owner.
</p>
<p id="p_7">
</p><p id="p_8">5.    Learned counsel appearing for the respondent justifies

the action and defends the action taken urging that if at all the

petitioner was duly authorized to occupy the premises by her

land owner, nothing prevented the petitioner to produce the

agreement of lease.
</p>
<p id="p_9">
</p><p id="p_10">6.    Having heard the learned counsel for both parties and on

perusal of the impugned communication, I find that impugned

communication is devoid of details and is cryptic. The

communication mentions that an order was passed in favour of

the department based on which the petitioner was notified to

produce a fresh agreement, but, petitioner did not produce any

such agreement nor furnished any written reply and it was also

learnt in the meanwhile that the petitioner had approached this

Court and therefore, awaiting the order from this Court, the

Authorities did not initiate any action (restoration of electricity).


</p><p id="p_11">7.    The impugned communication Annexure-A does not

mention which is the order of the Court which has gone in

favour of the department and what is the agreement the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                      5</span>



petitioner is required to produce. It also does not disclose

whether      petitioner     has   been   in   illegal   or    unauthorized

occupation      of    the    premises.    Therefore,        the   impugned

communication has to be characterized as cryptic, arbitrary

and illegal. If at all the petitioner is in illegal occupation of any

premises belonging to the Government or to the department,

the petitioner has to be notified with the details pertaining to

the order obtained from the department in the Court of law and

then, after putting the petitioner on notice and after hearing

her, pass appropriate orders. Prima facie, as asserted by the

petitioner, she has been granted license from the Panchayat

and therefore, without holding a proper enquiry and without

hearing her, such an action could not have been taken by the

respondent. Hence, the impugned communication deserves to

be set aside.
</p>
<p id="p_12">
</p><p id="p_13">8.    Accordingly, this writ petition is allowed. The impugned

communication is set aside. A direction is issued to restore

electricity to the petitioner's premises forthwith. It is open to the

respondent to notify and hear the petitioner in case the

petitioner      has    been       occupying     illegally     any    public
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                6</span>



property/government premises or the property belonging to the

electricity department.
</p>
<p id="p_14">
</p><p id="p_15">9.    The observations made in this order, it is made clear will

not in any manner affect the interest of the land owner, who

will have an independent right to seek redressal in accordance

with law.
</p>
<p id="p_16">

</p><p id="p_18">                                                    JUDGE
