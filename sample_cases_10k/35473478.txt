                                  JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">      Petitioner trusts being represented by their trustees have

filed this writ petition with the following prayers:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">            "i) call for the records leading to Exts.P2 series and Exts.P4
            series orders of the 2nd and 1st respondents and quash the
            same by the issuance of a writ of certiorari or such other
            writ, order or direction;
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">            ii) issue a writ of mandamus or such other writ, order or
            direction, directing the 2nd respondent to re-compute the
            income tax liability of the petitioners by applying the normal
            rate of tax applicable to Association of Persons for the
            assessment year 1997-98 in lieu of the maximum marginal
            rate of tax applicable under Section 164(1) of the Act and
            by deleting the levy of interest under <a href="/doc/536158/" id="a_1">Section 243</a> B of the
            Income Tax Act.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">           iii) direct the respondents not to initiate any coercive action
            against the petitioners for demand and recovery of the
            differential tax for the assessment year 1997-98 based on
            Exts.P4 series orders of the 1st respondent.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">           iv) grant a stay of all proceedings for demand and recovery
            of the differential tax amounts for the assessment year
            1997-98 based on Exts.P4 series orders of the 1st
            respondent, pending disposal of the writ petition;"</blockquote><p id="p_2">


</p><p id="p_3">      2. The specific case of the petitioners is that the

respondents erred in adopting the maximum marginal rate of

40% for the assessment of the petitioners during the assessment

year 1997-98. <a href="/doc/1839999/" id="a_2">Section 164</a> of the Income Tax Act deals with

discretionary trust and the treatment of the trustees of such a

trust as representative assessee. Proviso (iv) to Sub-section (1)

of <a href="/doc/1839999/" id="a_3">Section 164</a> of the Income Tax Act carves out an exception

from the rigor of <a href="/doc/1839999/" id="a_4">Section 164</a> in cases were the income of the

Trust is received by a trustee on behalf of, inter-alia, fund

created bonafide by a person carrying on a business or profession

exclusively for the benefit of persons employed in such business

or profession. The learned counsel for the petitioners submits

that as the trust in question was an exception to <a href="/doc/1839999/" id="a_5">Section 164</a>, the

maximum marginal rate could not be applied to the income of the

Trust.    The learned counsel for the petitioners in respect of

Ext.P8, order submits that while disposing of a batch of I.T.As by

the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal, Cochin Bench filed by the

petitioners, the Tribunal allowed all the appeals and held as

follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">      "11. Therefore, the only issue to be considered in the present case is
       whether the benefit is given to the employee alone or also to anybody
       else. The assessing officer as well as the CIT (Appeals) have decided
       against the assessee for the reason that the benefits are extended to
       the dependents and relatives of the employees also.         Now, the
       question to be considered is whether the benefits extended to the
       members of the family of the employees in fact amounted to benefits
       given to the employees alone or not.        In all welfare measures,
       whether under Government or in Public Sector, benefits extended to
       the employees means benefits extended to their family members
       also. For example, Government employees are covered by Medical
       Benefits Schemes.     The schemes are extended not only to the

W.P.(C).No.38174 Of 2003
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                          3</span>



      particular employee-individual alone; the immediate dependent
      relatives of the employee are also entitled for the benefit of such
      medical benefit schemes. In the case of educational benefits scheme,
      it is obvious that the benefits are in fact meant for the education of
      the wards of the employees. Educational allowance is not usually
      given for the employees to pursue educational course. Such
      allowances are meant for the children of employees. The expenses
      relating to higher education of the employees are usually claimed by
      the employers as normal business expenditure. Therefore, in actual
      life and practice, the immediate dependent family members of an
      employee cannot be disassociated from the employee. There is no
      case that the fruits of employment is enjoyed        by the concerned
      employee individual himself alone.         The salary and emoluments
      enjoyed by an employee is used by the employee not only for feeding
      himself, but also the dependent members of his family. Likewise, the
      benefits given to the employees are in fact extension of the
      emoluments of the employment. We cannot say that the employee
      alone need to be taken care of medically, and his wife and children
      should not be taken care. We cannot say that the employee alone
      should be fed and clothed and his dependent family members should
      not be taken care of in similar manner. Benefits to employees mean
      benefits to employees as well as their dependent family members.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">      13. Therefore, I hold that the assessee-Trust is entitled for the
      exemption available under proviso (iv) to sub-section (1) of Section
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_7">      164. The lower authorities have therefore erred in levying tax at the
      maximum marginal rate. The assessee-trust is liable to be taxed in
      the status of AOP at the respective normal slab rate.     The assessee
      succeeds in its appeals."</blockquote><p id="p_4">


</p><p id="p_5">     In that view of the matter, I asked the learned counsel for

the income tax department whether the department has

preferred any appeal against Ext.P8 order. On instructions, he

submits that no appeal has been preferred. Since the Tribunal
