Present:Mr. Junaid Singh, Advocate,
        for Mr. Aditya Jain, Advocate,
        for the petitioner.

AUGUSTINE GEORGE MASIH, J. (ORAL)

<p id="p_1">CM-11689-CWP-2019

             Prayer in this application is for restoration of the writ petition

which was dismissed for non-prosecution vide order dated 13.08.2019.

</p><p id="p_2">             For the reasons mentioned in the application, which is duly

supported by the affidavit of the clerk of the counsel, the present

application is allowed. Order dated 13.08.2019 is recalled and the writ

petition is restored to its original number.
</p>
<p id="p_3">CWP-21396-2019

             Challenge in this writ petition is to the order dated 31.12.2018

(Annexure P-4) passed by the Financial Commissioner Revenue and

Disaster Management Department, Haryana-respondent No. 1, whereby the

order dated 23.12.2011 (Annexure P-2) passed by the Deputy

Commissioner-cum-Commissioner (Sales), Kaithal-respondent No. 2 and

order dated 21.12.2012 (Annexure P-3) passed by the Tehsildar (Sales),

Kaithal, District Kaithal-respondent No. 3, have been set aside.


</p><p id="p_4">                                      1 of 3

             It is the contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner that

the impugned order dated 31.12.2018 (Annexure P-4) has been passed

without taking into consideration the well-reasoned and speaking orders

passed by the Deputy Commissioner-cum-Commissioner (Sales), Kaithal-

respondent No. 2 and Tehsildar (Sales), Kaithal, District Kaithal-respondent

No. 3. He contends that there is no bar in the notification with regard to

leasing out of the Barani land.                He contends that the Financial

Commissioner Revenue has misread the said notification and has proceeded

on a wrong assumption merely following the submissions as have been

made by the Assistant District Attorney, Kaithal. He, therefore, contends

that the impugned order, vide which the orders passed by the Deputy

Commissioner-cum-Commissioner (Sales), Kaithal and the Tehsildar

(Sales), Kaithal, District Kaithal have been set aside, cannot sustain and

deserves to be set aside.
</p>
<p id="p_5">             I have considered the submissions made by the learned counsel

for the petitioner and with his assistance, have gone through the records of

the case.
</p>
<p id="p_6">             The contention, as has been raised by the counsel for the

petitioner, is not acceptable at this stage and is not being commented upon

for the reason that this aspect has not been taken into consideration by the

Deputy Commissioner-cum-Commissioner (Sales), Kaithal while passing

the order which was the subject matter of challenge before the Financial

Commissioner.      The order, which has been passed by the Deputy

Commissioner-cum-Commissioner (Sales), Kaithal, has been found to be a

non-speaking order and for that reason, the case had been remanded back

by the Financial Commissioner for fresh decision while taking into

consideration each and every aspect and while applying judicial mind and

not merely approving the order of the Tehsildar (Sales), Kaithal. The

contention of the counsel for the petitioner that the order passed by the

Financial Commissioner would virtually leave scope to the Deputy

Commissioner-cum-Commissioner (Sales), Kaithal for adjudication, cannot

be accepted as the Financial Commissioner has only observed with regard

to the position as projected by the Assistant District Attorney which appears

to be reasonable and justified and, therefore, there is no illegality in the

order passed by the      Financial Commissioner Revenue and Disaster

Management Department, Haryana-respondent No. 1.

petition, the same stands dismissed.
