Coram:      Hon'ble Mr. Justice Rakesh Kumar Jain

Present:    Mr. Aman Pal, Advocate for the petitioner.

            Mr.H.S.Baidwan, Advocate for the respondents.

</pre>
<p id="p_1">            The petitioner has prayed for the issuance of a writ in the nature

of mandamus seeking a direction to the respondents i.e. Regional Passport

Office, Chandigarh to issue a new passport to him on the file bearing

No.CH1070903012616.
</p>
<p id="p_2">            Counsel for the petitioner has submitted that the petitioner was

holding a passport bearing No.G1746039 which was cancelled because of

the pendency of the court case before the Additional Sessions Judge (I)

Bhiwani. It is submitted that the petitioner was otherwise acquitted in the

said case on 5.10.2012. The petitioner has applied for a new passport by

moving application bearing file No.CH1070903012616 before respondent

No.1. He was directed to appear before the Passport Adalat on 21.5.2015 for

the purpose of clarifying certain facts mentioned in the application. It is

alleged that the petitioner had appeared before the Passport Adalat and

submitted the requisite documents stating that he had been acquitted but the

passport was not issued. On this premise, this Court had issued notice to the

respondents on 29.2.2016. Thereafter, the respondents have put in

appearance but no reply has been filed.
</p>
<p id="p_3">              Sh.H.S.Baidwan, Advocate who is appearing on behalf of the

respondents, has expressed his inability to assist the Court on the ground

that the Passport Authority, despite his repeated requests, is not assisting

him in this regard.
</p>
<p id="p_4">              Be that as it may, the only prayer made by the petitioner is for a

direction to the respondents to consider his case once again. Keeping in

view the peculiar facts and circumstances of this case in which the Court

has not been assisted by the respondents, the present petition is hereby

disposed of with a direction to respondent No.1 to reconsider the

application of the petitioner bearing file No.CH1070903012616. The

petitioner is directed to appear before the Passport Authority on 31.5.2018.

The passport authority-respondent No.1 is directed to decide the issue in

regard to issuance of passport to the petitioner within a period of 15 days

thereafter.
