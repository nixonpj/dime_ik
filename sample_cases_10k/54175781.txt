JASWANT SINGH, J. (ORAL)
</pre>
<p id="p_1">              Petitioner-Vishav Bhushan Khanna has retired from the rank

of Assistant Corporation Engineer from the service of Municipal

Corporation, Ludhiana, on attaining the age of superannuation on

31.12.2011. As the petitioner was denied the grant of ACP scales and the

consequent pay fixation, as also the retiral benefits, he filed a writ petition

bearing CWP No. 26031 of 2014, which was disposed of, vide order dated

18.12.2014 (Annexure P-6) by learned Single Judge of this Court, directing

the State of Punjab/Municipal Corporation, Ludhiana, to pass a speaking

order within two months from the date of receipt of the certified copy of the

order on the representation pending with the respondents.

</p><p id="p_2">              The present contempt petition was filed with the allegations

that the aforesaid order dated 18.12.2014 (P-6) has not been complied

within the stipulated time.

                Upon notice, a reply was filed.        A speaking order dated

05.06.2015 (Annexure R-1/1) stands passed by the Secretary to

Government of Punjab, Department of Local Government, Punjab.

</p><p id="p_4">                During the previous hearing, it was pointed out that the

complete retiral benefits have not been released, inasmuch as the amount of

almost ` 10,00,000/- (Ten lacs only) towards gratuity has been withheld.

The reason for withholding the amount is that the petitioner had an entry of

a temporary advance loan of ` 8,02,041/- (Eight Lacs Two Thousand Forty

One only) towards his name, while his tenure between 09.08.2005 to

10.10.2008 with the Municipal Corporation, Jalandhar, before his transfer to

the Municipal Corporation, Ludhiana.
</p>
<p id="p_5">                This Court to resolve the issue, vide order dated 03.04.2017,

had directed the petitioner to approach the Authorities concerned to explain

his position.
</p>
<p id="p_6">                The petitioner, by way of miscellaneous application bearing

CM No. 18729-CII of 2017, had sought to place on record the letter

submitted before the Commissioner, Municipal Corporation, Ludhiana as

Annexure P-10 and his affidavit as Annexure P-11, revealing his stand

qua the said outstanding loan.
</p>
<p id="p_7">                After hearing counsel for the parties, it is apparent that the

directions passed by this Court vide order dated 18.12.2014 (P-6) stands

complied with, albeit belatedly. Therefore, this Court is not inclined to

proceed any further with the present contempt petitioner, and the same is

dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_8">                However, a direction is issued to Secretary to Government of

Punjab, Department of Local Government, Punjab, to enquire into the matter

of the outstanding amount and, thereafter, if need,                 be   issue a

comprehensive show cause notice, indicating the reasons for liability of the

petitioner to explain and pay the outstanding loan. The needful shall be

done within two months from today and upon receipt of the reply of the

petitioner to the show cause, if any, a proper reasoned/informed decision

shall be taken within next one month of the receipt of such reply. If any

amount is found due as per the decision, the same shall be disbursed

forthwith to the petitioner.

<p id="p_9">                 Since the main petition has been decided/dismissed, therefore,

no orders are required to be passed in the pending miscellaneous

application(s), if any.
